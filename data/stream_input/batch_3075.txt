B00992CF6W|5.0|Thus game is so fun there are monsters and it is just amazing I play with my friends and we slodder Monsters
0679879269|5.0|This book is the best. Truly. And the most amazing in this trilogy. Just. Sigh. I cannot with how amazing this book is. And I'm so glad to have read it a third time. These books means so much to me. Though they have broken my heart again and again. Yet they have also made my heart the most happy.<br /><br />I'm not sure how to talk about this book. It is so long. Well, it isn't nearly long enough, but it took very long to read. And I loved that. I just really wish it hadn't ended. And I wish there had been even more about Lyra and Will in this one. Sniffs. Yet it was also the perfect amount of everything, and I loved it all.<br /><br />I should say that this is still the most heartbreaking ending I have ever read. And I doubt that will ever change. But it is also the most amazing book. And I couldn't love it more. Despite that devil ending. Because I also have hope. As I feel like I read a lot of hints about what might be coming next, how the ending might change. And I hope. Oh, how I hope. And if the ending doesn't get changed, well, then I will be heartbroken until the end of times. Sigh. But I still have hope. Because Philip Pullman is currently writing The Book of Dust, which might publish late 2016, and my gosh. It will be about Lyra. And that is all I know about it. But I know it will be long. And I have hope that it might have Will too. Pretty please. Crossing my fingers :)<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass is such an amazing book. And I have such a high love for it. I loved reading from Lyra and Will the most, because they are the bestest, but I also really did enjoy reading from the other characters as well. As they are all interesting. And Mary is awesome. I grew to really love Lyra's mother. I feel like I did understand her. So yeah. I liked her. Sniffs. And her father too. Well. Sort of. He could have done better. But what they both did near the end was so amazing and I really loved them for it.<br /><br />There is so much in this book. So much. And I shall not talk about it all. I just really need to share some of my feelings for this book, again. As I felt so much reading it for the third time. I loved it even more, I'm sure. And I love Lyra and Will even more than I did before. I shall never stop loving them. But oh. I want more. I want so much more. This cannot be the end of them. It cannot be. Sniffs. But even so, it is such an amazing final book too. Just. So heartbreaking. But full of so many amazing moments. Sigh.<br /><br />I couldn't even begin to talk about everything happening in this book. I loved all of it so much. I loved reading about the fight with the angels. I loved reading about the angels sort of protecting Will. And the new small people too. They were so brave. I loved reading more about the bears. I adored the new creatures that Mary became friends with. It was awesome to read about them, and how they lived, and the creepy birds that lived near them. Shudders. Overall, this book is so damn exciting. I loved it so.<br /><br />All the things happening in this book. The visit to the world of the dead. The war with heaven. The pain with the dæmons. And oh my gosh. The romance. The friendship between Lyra and Will. And how it slowly turns into something more. Sure, they are young, but not too young. And their romance is the sweetest thing in the world. The first kiss. SWOONS. I have never loved a kiss more. And I just. My heart is breaking. It is the sweetest thing. And the most heartbreaking. I just cannot deal with it. Sobs.<br /><br />I could probably talk about The Amber Spyglass forever. And I wish to. But I shall not. I just really wanted to mention how much I loved this book. And how special it is to my heart. And how much I adore Will and Lyra. They are just so damn adorable. And so brave. And so cute. And just the very best characters I have read about. Sniffs. I can't deal with how amazing these books have been. And now I want to read them a fourth time right away. How mean. This book stolemy heart, though. And it hurts so badly.<br /><br />I have loved reading the Folio versions of these books. Though it was also very stressful, as I tried so hard not to damage them in any way, yet I do have a very hairy cat, so there is a lot of cat hair. Sigh. But that's okay. Probably. I'm considering buying a second set of these. Ack. Though.. expensive. Yet so beautiful. And yeah. I just cannot decide :D The artwork in this book is stunning too. &#60;3 Though there were not that many images at all, sniffs. Wishing there had been more. But they were all gorgeous.<br /><br />I can't begin to tell you how much I love these books by Philip Pullman. They are simply the best. And I love Lyra and Will with all my heart. They are forever my favorite characters. Sniffs. And this world. Sigh. It is the bestest. Oh, I just want more and more. I have read all his books from this universe, but I shall also check out the other books by Philip. Hoping they might be half as awesome as this trilogy is, hih :) Either way, I cannot wait to read more books by him. Because these books are perfection. &#60;3<br /><br />---<br /><br />I first read this book from April 20th to 21st 2013.

B000FC2ROU|4.0|This book is bizarre. All of Murakami's books have fantastical elements to it, but this one went above and beyond anything I've read of his other works. A head-spinning plot keeps the story going. I enjoyed the references to Japanese and Greek mythology and how they influenced the story.

0399226907|5.0|This is just such a wonderful book to read to a child. The theme of growth and metamorphosis, the vibrant colors, opportunities for learning counting, days of the week, night and day, the many foods the caterpillar eats... I could go on.<br /><br />The board book construction has weathered the ravages of my toddler nicely; we can read over and over about the foods the caterpillar eats through without fear the book itself will be eaten.<br /><br />I remember loving this book as a kid, reading it to my students, and now reading it to my son.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I was excited when you brought candy crush to the Kindle apps it is fun and addictive.  However paying to go to a new level or bombarding my non game playing FB friends is annoying and not fun.  Five lives goes quick and the wait to get more too long.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Cool gadget. Unless you're watching a lot online, the novelty will fade pretty fast. It works as it is supposed to though!!
B008220D7S|2.0|I hate this movie. Unfortunately I let someone talk me into buying it.  I'm going to re-gift it like a fruit cake.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I Love this game. It's so much fun building your own town or village. I plan on getting more of these games. Will tell everyone about your games.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|He does it again.  For those of you who wondered what happened to the little boy in The Shining look no more.  The novel takes on the life of Dan Torrance and what unimaginable hell it must be to constanttly hear the voices of those around you.  Delving into the depths of the world of alcholics, King also creates a new horror with the True Knot, a group of sense vampires who live to drink the \\"steam\\" that emits from their victims, children who seemingly possess the power to shine.  King keeps up the pace throughout the novel and it will keep up at night.  NO sleep for YOU!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is awesome. It is fun to play and if u like it tough then this is a good game to play
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved it! Stephen King once again has lived up to his reputation. Dan Torrance and Abra great characters. Rose and clan outrageous.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was amazing it has so much detail if you compare it to the movie why I think it needs 5 stars is because the part where Peeta eats the NightLock is shocking and exciting
0061780308|5.0|Amazon, you need to realize that these items may be GIFTS!! You put the price sticker UNDER the shrink wrap! In my case, it wasn't a huge deal because the recipient was my sis - thankfully! How tacky, to give a gift with the price tag on it! :(
B007FG9LIE|1.0|Thought I bought a mystery turned out to be syfi.  I thought it sucked. Read 80% of it then skimmed the rest.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book! I thought the character development was intriguing and flowed like life itself. Realistic and believable. People really are that self-absorbed & deceitful, yet forgiving, And, I love the &#34;what ifs&#34; at the end!!
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|Nate Ryder rocks! I loved this book, as I loved the other two before it. I was waiting for this to be released and was chuffed to finally get my copy. It's just a cool sci-fi story that built on well from the previous novels. Recommended.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|There of plenty lengthy reviews, so I will keep mine fairly brief.<br /><br />It's unfortunate how much of a disappointment this was. The writing was extremely poor, the book rambled on, the ending was horrible, and not to mention predictable. I contemplated not finishing on multiple occasions, because it was really that bad. The first two were so good, that I really didn't expect the book to be poor.<br /><br />It seems like Roth wrote the series &#34;on the fly&#34; without knowing the end until she began writing the third book. It just seemed like there were a lot of holes in the plan, and a lot of extraneous scenes that were built as space fillers. Not to mentioned the POV changes didn't work at all.<br /><br />For those that read the first two, it's worth reading from a curiosity standpoint. However, I wouldn't recommend new readers pick this series up based upon Allegiant. It's a shame, because I have been an advocate of the series in the past.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|If you enjoy hearing or reading sales pitches, you will love this book. Instead of letting the plot move along, or allowing the characters's lives to reveal the ever encroaching power of The Circle, we are treated to one sales pitch after the other, as each step of the circle is &#34; pitched&#34; to Mae, the main character of this book. Mae has no personality, no humor, no interesting life. Neither does anyone else. BORING
B008IJTFYW|5.0|excellent for every mood or situation!!!!! would recommend highly for adults to children n babies!!!!!<br />great for relaxing evenings, childrens naptimes, quiet moments, supper time and bedtime.

B0027MJU00|5.0|I've read two of Gillian Flynn's novels and they were both total page turners with an intense story. Really enjoy her boldness.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A well written story and one I truly enjoyed.  Worth the read.  I have nothing more to say except interesting read and I'm just trying to take up required space to post this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved all the versions of this game the best can't wate<br /> In till the Christmas one comes out<br />THE BEST I'D SEEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really good and I play this game more than my other games on my kindle.you must get this game and I rate it five stars.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|I really love this game. The physics are fun. Rockets are very customizable and yet easy and simple to build. This is just a great game.<br />One problem.. The Amazon version is outdated compared to the release version that is available Google Play. I am tempted to go buy the game again through Google Play.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Incredible reality in a sci-fi setting. We must compromise before violence. I can't wait to read more from Hugh Howdy.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like the game but wish there was a way that extra lives could be stored. Also wish you could get more quicker. Have yet to be able to use all my extra moves that friends have given me.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the view, colors and how smoothly it works.  It is a nice app to have on my Kindle Fire.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This novel is perhaps the greatest Grisham creation yet. I was totally absorbed and moved by the characters and by the skillfully woven plot  and subplots. For those of  US who love American history and the importance of ancestry, this is a must read.
0061673730|2.0|\\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" was something I read back in the '70s because of the title and also because other people said it was enlightening.  I have to admit that what I took away from the book was that Pirsig did not have a clue about teenagers, normal teenage development, or communication with teenagers, and that he basically disrespected them.  Take, for example, the teenage mechanic in the service station who attempted to perform maintenance on the motorcycle with a pair of pliers.  Pirsig dismissed this individual as a hopelessly inadequate human being, rather than seeing there an opportunity to provide some meaningful insight and instruction to the kid, a kid who obviously was hired to pump gas, who had no experience with motorcycle maintenance and yet was attempting to be helpful in the best way he knew how.  I felt that Pirsig's attitude demonstrated a lack of compassion and understanding.  And Pirsig's relationship with his son in this book was difficult for me to understand.  I felt that at times Pirsig showed contempt for the boy and did not care to get to know him or to pass on some degree of enlightenment to his own son. The boy obviously was in need of love and meaningful communication from his father, and what he got instead was distance and a cold, dismissive attitude.
B006Z00R1Q|1.0|There is no excuse to have continuity issues if you are telling a story in reverse. Also the creators/writers of these can't develop a plot or tell a good story to save their lives.<br /><br />Good for special effects and to get your imagination playing tricks on you. Otherwise don't waste your time.
B00E1LT41K|5.0|What a grand and fabulous &#34;escape&#34;! Each episode was historically interesting and the romance between Edward and Elizabeth was very powerful. The chemistry with Max Irons and Rebecca was very enjoyable. Elizabeth's mother was one of the best parts of the series. She was strong and confident and she passed that onto Elizabeth. All of the actors were very good.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|Great movie. Kids watch this movie over and over. Very entertaining and a great traveling movie. My husband and I love it also.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Really enjoyed loosing my self in this novel. The desolation and struggle, alongside all the various emotions and questions keeps one yearning for more. A very well written novel.
1401937519|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  It has had a PROFOUND effect on the way I view my own life and my purpose in this world.  Anita Moorjani is a badass!  I'm so grateful that she shared her story.  I've read my share of books on near death experiences and this is by far my favorite!  Even if you're not fascinated by near death experiences, this book still has a lot to offer you.  You don't have to be physically ill either to be able to relate to it.  I just really liked this book and Anita's message...that we are all here to just be ourselves--express who we really are as individuals and that that is the most significant contribution any one of us can make to the world.  She says it much more eloquently.  Read it. You won't regret it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. Kids love it too Dec worth it for a free game. I play all the time. So do the kids
147676459X|5.0|I ordered this because I love the Hyperbole and a Half blog and I think Allie's writing is hilarious.  If you have not checked it out then I would recommend doing so before buying the book.<br /><br />The book has alot of new material and the quality of the printing is excellent.  I ordered the hardcover and cannot comment on the softcover version.  The book is in all color and the paper has a high quality feel with a nice gloss and heavy weight.  The MSRP is 28 for the hard cover and it was a great buy under $20.<br /><br />This book would make for an excellent gift for a younger person with a good sense of humor.  I really got a kick out of the story about motivation, it is my favorite new story so far.<br /><br />Now go eat some chocolate chips after you get motivated enough to buy this book.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Easy to use with advanced options. Quick easy scans. For free you can't beat it. Try it and like it.<br />There reviews are a pain in the ....
B00881VLCE|1.0|contacted support about not letting me do the puzzels they said working on it but that was a week ago still no fix
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I wouldn't say these books are my absolute favorite but they are up there and I'm definitely hooked on them.<br /><br />I'm in my early twenties but still enjoy reading some teen books because they are lighter reading than adult books. Its nice to find a teen series that isn't afraid to talk about certain taboo subjects like drugs, drinking, sex, etc... you know, things that are out there in the real world that most parents hate to think their kids will come into contact with.<br /><br />As the series goes on these girls seem to be getting what has been coming to them ever since they became the mean girls of their school, so don't think that they get what they want with no consequences... they get theirs eventually.<br /><br />Pretty little liars is a quick read... the end sneaks up on you before you even realize you're there.<br /><br />I also like that it is different from the tv show because it keeps you guessing. Some things are the same but some things are very different.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Such a hard book to follow. Couldn't get connected with characters as there were so many throughout the entire book.
0061122416|4.0|good sealer and great item<br />I am very happy with this item and sealer<br />I recommend you this sealer and item
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is sexy, twisted and amazing! I think it's in the race with 50 Shades of Grey. Wow it has so much emotion and craziness, that it would make any woman or man insane. Not to mention the sex! Hot, Crazy, Twisted and Amazingly written. Can't wait to start reading the next book.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Who doesn't like the Goonies? It's what childhood is about, all the differences and similarities with adventures creates a bond to last a lifetime.

B00CWY76CC|3.0|Needs hints, it is a great mind game. Some items I can't even tell what they are<br />. It keeps me guessing
0345529057|5.0|This is a great series and when I started, I had no idea that there would be a series on HBO that would be as good as it is.
B00ERH15WY|5.0|At last, I have more than the three songs on my Bad Religion holiday sampler to carry me through this time of the year! This album is packed with passionately performed, punk-rocking tunes that barely reflect any of the underlying irony and cynicism of atheists singing about Christmas. Whether you're a lifetime BR fan who buys everything they produce (I can't wait for my vinyl version of this album to arrive!) or just someone who appreciates some diversity, drums, and bass in your holiday (I LOVE the bottom lines of &#34;The Little Drummer Boy&#34;), this is a great CD to add to your collection. It has truly made my week to drive around blasting this album with my windows down, singing along loudly and proudly, and enjoying the alternating looks of consternation and amusement as people recognize what they're hearing. Such fun!<br /><br />P.S. I agree with other reviewers that the song order could easily have been adjusted on this album to make it &#34;perfect,&#34; and I don't really notice any significant changes in this rendition of &#34;American Jesus,&#34; which I now have alternate versions of on several albums. The absence of &#34;Silent Night&#34; from the compilation is also a bit sad.
B00915G6MG|5.0|My copy of the Tenth season of NCIS arrived ahead of schedule and in perfect condition.  It was a gift for my mother and she loved it!
B005ES0XQY|4.0|I normally wear a 11.5 mens, so I was disappointed there are no half sizes.  I ordered the size 11.  My second toe is longer than my big toe, and it uncomfortably rubs the front of the shoe.  Otherwise the shoe is fairly loose.  I'm afraid that if I try a size 12 it will be too big.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Best knife money can buy. Love it!!!!!!!! Can't go wrong with this one and the price was right. Very strong knife.
B009APMNB0|3.0|Geek Roger Meyer has tested and evaluated \\"Smile\\". Here is his report:<br /><br />The Colormunki software hardware and software are designed to auto-calibrate your computer monitor for the best color settings.  It consists of a mouse-like device you hang on the face of your monitor and let the software perform any necessary color setting adjustments automatically.<br /><br /> The software took forever to load. I began to wonder if it was hung up as there was no indication that it was still loading.  The loading window was present and said it was \\"finishing,\\" but it took a LONG time.  Once the program finished loading, it asked to restart the computer, which I did.  After restarting, I ran the program, and from that point on, it was a totally \\"hands off\\" operation.  When it completed the monitor calibration, it offered the option of seeing a picture in a \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" configuration.  While there was a definite difference in the two pictures, I'm not sure I really liked the \\"after\\" version better.  It's not bad, but it appears to me to be a little \\"grayer\\" and not as \\"warm\\" as the before (original) version.<br /><br /> In summary, from an ease of use standpoint, it couldn't be any easier.  I was a little concerned over the length of time it took to install, which caused me to wonder if it was hung up.  Once installed, the calibration procedure was totally automatic. I wasn't all that impressed with the resultant changes, however.  Color perception and expectation can be a personal bias that varies from one person to another, and a \\"one size fits all\\" software approach may not be optimal for everyone.
B00742GBDM|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! It is the best version I have seen yet! A little sketchy in some parts...so skip them! The rest is fabulous!
B009NH6JRE|5.0|I guess this show is a H U G E  hit; however, not with me.  My son and his friends love this type of series so this too is a Christmas present.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game but I think it should be set as a game without time. This game serves better unlimited.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|He was right.  ;)  Now when he wants to show me something online he just tosses it up on the tv, and I do the same, rather than running back and forth to the others computers.  Toss Netflix up to watch movies.  So easy.  Now we just need an easy way to get our amazon videos up there and we would have it all.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I love anything Brandon Sanderson writes!  His books are written amazingly well, lots of details and always twists and turns that are not expected.  He certainly was given a gift of penmanship!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Love it it's absolutely amazing and a good read you should read it because it awesome and my most favorite
B0089LOG02|5.0|I didn't want the story to end!!!  It was hard to read all the trials both Molly and Vivian had to endure but that makes the ending so much better.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Every since I saw the movie and read the book &#34;Lincoln Lawyer&#34;, I've been a fan of Michael Connelly. Im reading all of Harry Boush stories' and they all have surprised me. Just wish Harry could have  a love in his life and a close-range relationship with his daughter.  Bring the daughter and ex back into the US and back into Harry's life, please.
B005COO1X6|4.0|King is sometimes at his best when he keeps it short. This is a good example of that. He always has a good scary story
B0050DIWFC|3.0|A light read; competently written and perhaps deserves a little more than an 'ok' rating.<br />And that's how I'd recommend it.  I would try another book by William Landay.
B00E5N8DGG|4.0|I've spent the last few weeks watching this Blu-ray and I'm enjoying it thoroughly.  The video quality is very good and the sound mix is somewhat clear, actually a bit bass heavy.  Honestly, the Ded Flatbird sets (listed under \\"bonus 1\\" and \\"bonus 2\\" in the menu) are far better than the Hysteria set.  I'm a big fan of \\"High 'n' Dry\\" and \\"Pyromania\\" albums so that is what I really dig about this Blu-ray.  The inclusion of \\"Good Morning Freedom\\" was the icing on the cake!  That song was previously only available as the B side to the \\"Hello America\\" single, from the \\"On Through the Night\\" era.  Great song.<br /><br />I don't notice much difference between the stereo and 5.1 mixes (both encoded in DTS-HD MA at 48khz/24bit resolution).  I'll explain.  The stereo audio stream going through a Neo:6 decoder sounds identical to the discrete 5.1 surround mix.  So honestly, the surround mix isn't a real surround mix IMHO so I had to dock one star.  I'm listening to this on a fully calibrated JBL Studio series surround system.  Otherwise, this is still a must own for Def Leppard fans.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|Mark is always an mazing actor and I will forever watch everything he acts in.  Suspenseful movie and Russell is as always a good actor! Worth the watch…I gave it a 5 because I am unable to give it a 4.5…Good chewing gum for the eyes!
034580404X|5.0|These books are wretched, but I couldn't put them down.<br />Thanks E.L.! You definitely made my first week of Fall interesting!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyable challenge at your own pace.  Logical deductions lead to timely resolve  Great mind game. But  don`t over think it.  Enjoy!
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this game, but I couldn't have been happier.  I loved solving the puzzles and finding all the collectibles, and although none of the levels stumped me, several of the hidden ferrets and secret items did!  The hint system is detailed and generous (Using the hint book means you get walkthroughs for the level, the ferret and the secret items all at once).  The stories and animations are quirky and delightful.  I only wish there was more!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app.it stays on my start screen all the time.I can get the information immediately. I can also update it right from that screen anytime I like. There are so many things in this app that I don't use. I hope I learn to use them soon so I can really take advantage of all the great features.
B008EL25LE|2.0|This game gets 2 stars because of its beautiful graphics, but, unfortunately, I couldn't get past the first level.  The game kept closing randomly while I was trying to play.  After the fourth time this happened, I stopped trying and uninstalled.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|It is super fun with all the character choices. The graphics are amazing. Hours of intertainment. Good difficulty. Overall this is a great game for the whole family.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoyed this game tremendously and found myself very addicted.  The two smaller levels of puzzles seemed overly simple, but the 15x15 puzzles were challenging, especially towards the end!  I was very impressed with the mechanics of this game.  It was simple to learn and easy to use.  I am very tempted to buy more.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series! Great book! It's my second time to read and just as good! Can't wait for the movie!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I do not usually read books of this genre but decided to try this one. It started out slow but by the middle of the book it was much better and at times a page turner. I enjoyed it and would recommend it for others to read.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Many will recognize the hits (Isn't She Lovely, Sir Duke, I Wish) and the samples (Pastime Paradise). This album is visionary, experimental and joyous!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|love all the characters! the plot! the twists! I just didn't like at all that the book didn't have an ending, I'm waiting for the next book anxiously!
B007N5YJYS|4.0|Knowing that it was the inspiration for North by Northwest I thought I would like it more than I did.  The plot seemed too contrived.  The Lady Vanishes has held up a lot better in my opinion!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the graphics, the game has good speed, and the game overall is a lot of fun. really great
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|I don't think the story is that much of a surprise at this point.<br />I was a bit surprised, however, at some of the production values, definitely seemed more like a TV movie than a theatrical release.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|love the characters! didn´t expect a lot of the twists and turns in the story, sincerely I can´t get enough! and so life like, with people with different shades, terrible people, people one roots for, treason, love... it has it all!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game even though it's addicting.  Some levels are easy, and some are very hard. Don't give up keep trying .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  It's interesting and challenging, and never boring! Many imitations out there, but none as good as the original.
B00425S1H8|5.0|If transferring files to a cnc machine is your focus, then this RS232 serial adapter is what you are looking for. Works reliably under windows 8.0 & 8.1.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So glad candy crush has finally<br />Made for my kindle.  So far no glitches I am hopelessly hooked and stuck on level 101!  It is fun but you have to be careful not to get frustrated and buy your way out of the tough levels.  Well maybe just a few times.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This movie is about fun and it is a lot of fun with some great music.  I've enjoyed watching multiple times.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I enjoyed this much more than I expected to given it's average review scores. I wonder if people expect a certain type of movie with Tom Cruise and are disappointed to find that this movie is a bit more thoughtful than they expected?<br /><br />This was a nice surprise.
1423136802|5.0|I'm using a curriculum that requires reading The Lightning Thief, but I've honestly enjoyed this whole series.  My students love the ties to Greek mythology and Percy's story.  I enjoyed each book's fast pace and humor.  Buying it as a boxed set (for $22) makes it a better value than buying individually.
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|Full disclosure: Different stoke for different folks. As a songwriter and music fan, I generally stay away from synths and dance music. Consider the following: I prefer Radiohead's The Bends/Ok Computer to Kid A/ Amnesiac; Bowie's glam rock to his blue eyed soul (Young Americans); early Talking Heads over their MTV video hits; Joy Division over New Order. If you disagree with any of the above, please add 1-2 stars to this review.<br /><br />Arcade Fire's fourth full length album, Reflektor, is a dazzling/muddled glorious mess. Singer/leader Win Butler shoots for the stars with big dance beats and eighties synths. The two volume set jumps from genre to genre and its eighty minutes are twenty minutes too long. Hits and near hits are mixed with mediocre misses.<br /><br />The positive: Booming bass and thunderous drums rule most tracks (check your speakers before playing!) If one would choose to dance to the apocalypse, this could be the soundtrack. The themes are epic: Greek mythology/The meaning of life. Nihilism never sounded so fun.<br /><br />The negative: The melodies here are sub par. Butler dresses them up with effects, atmosphere and Regine Chassagne's enchanting backing vocals. Also, there is none of the soaring majesty of Funeral here (face it, that's a once in a career  recording.) The second volume has a couple of ethereal tracks, \\"Awful Sound (Oh, Eurdice)\\", \\"It's Never Over (Hey, Orpheus.)\\" Unfortunately, these tracks lack the typical passion of A.F. Most of the fire comes from the dance tracks (Reflektor, for example) on disc one.<br /><br />Fortunately, Arcade Fire never make the same record twice. Here's hoping that future releases burn brighter and hotter. It's time to leave the disco: It's crowded and not nearly as enjoyable as this disc would have you believe.
1400052181|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I choose this for our book club and could not but it down.  Loved the way the author mixed family with the more serious parts of the book.  This is a must read.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was not a fan of having two narrators in the story. I felt the Tobias was weak and annoying the whole time. It was depressing and hard to get to the end. This book had so.much potential but it wen no where.<br /><br />Authors need to remember people don't read to become depressed they read to escape reality and expand their minds. I think the message still could have been said, but not lose sight of the characters from the first two books. Honestly the book had no life in it. Did they not test this with readers first? It felt rushed and like vr was bored with the third book.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It is a pretty good game, until you reach a higher level. It seems as though you can't get anywhere unless you spend money. Nearly impossible to achieve thw questsunlessbyou spend. The lower levels are fun and challenging, but if you are looking for a game you can play start to finish this is not the one.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|The last time I watched a movie this scary......was &#34;Christine&#34; 1983 Stephen King movie . I enjoyed this movie a lot.
B00008G7UF|5.0|This was a great film.<br />The whole cast brought to fruition the point that no matter how well our lives are planned out love always finds a way to be included.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I realize I discovered this series a little late.  But the good news is, I don't have to wait until next week to see the next episode!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Yes I loved it and hated it at times. Ana can be challenging to say the least at, On and off about what she wants in that red room. I found it a fun read, never a Pulitzer but great fun. It is repetitive at times but boy a great ride . Christian and Ana facing the challenges of building a romance, being different people trying to make it work while going through  his dark times.It it hot and sexy.......... But we are adults and this is just entertainment for me.<br /> It was a easy read for me and I loved every minute of it. And yes. Like a previous reader said it is like crack , not the best for ya but boy it was good!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think prince k should be deleted from subway surfers<br />For good and the limited things should be cheaper to make<br />Things easier for us...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|It was an enjoyable movie it there seemed to be some pretty large holes in the plot. Acting and special effects were real good.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is a great series, with engaging plot, great character development, and seasoned actors.  Look forward to watching more seasons.
B004I744AS|5.0|great as a basic dictionary, but so much more. Links lead to articles and interesting and fun info I otherwise wouldn't have known. And I love that you can customize the home page.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I saw the first 30 minutes of the movie.  I did not get to finish the movie. I generally download the movies at work, I look at the movies on lunch break.  I do not have WIFI connection at home.  I will have to rent the movie again.<br />But, I do like the movie.<br /><br />Rita
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is just like playing on the i pad. Other reviews have said it is not the same game. Seems exactly the same to me. Love it!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The crappy thing is that Amazon charged me for the non-episodes as episodes.  I thought that was pretty lame way to make an extra buck.
0545626382|4.0|I am giving a four stars because I didn't like what happened to Finnick...😒.....Really...He was one of my favorites...Sometimes I wonder why can the authors think about how the readers feel about the characters...
B003ASLJKO|5.0|No vampires, no giggly teenage girls in heat, no piercings, tattoos or grabbing their crotch. Just humorous entertainment. Something to save me from having to watch 2 broke girls and all the canned laughter.
006202406X|1.0|First of all I didn't think the books were as good as the Hunger Games triology...with that said I was disappointed about what happened after they crossed the fence...and the ending was not any better....She favored Tobias and Evelyn...instead of Tobias and Triss...Triss  DESERVED better...She needs to get new Editors...
B008Q08IV4|5.0|This movie can help us to achieve our goals in life. And never give up people there is no limits on whatever we put our minds on.
B00CHS31DG|4.0|I just got this app and its pretty cool. When I first started it it picked up the word spider.. and hes... mixture.. which I thought was weird because I have a fake brown and black halloween spider on my desk. I had to turn it off because I was in the office all alone. I cant wait to take it home and try it out. I am not quite sure what the VOX is or how to use it but I'm sure I will figure it out. Also it won't take pictures on the kindle fire hd. I found the vocabulary list once and now I cant find it. But all in all a pretty cool app for free.<br /><br />Sometimes it just spouts out random words but I thought the spider one was cool.
B007SGM084|5.0|Wonderful.Started out on the dull side. Then got interesting. Just had to keep on reading and reading. I enjoyed yhr book.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I like it. I eagerly read it in few weeks as it happened to other Follet's books.  In a few  points the plot is somehow predictable: for instance when  Lloyd is send back to France for rescuing downed pilots, I guessed he would met Boy, and since the latter had previously refused to divorce from Daisy, I even guessed Lloyd would meet  a dying Bob. However its reading gave me different feelings such as hatred, sadness, and joy ... all emotions  which make beautiful a book.  It is also nice to go through important historical events while enjoying all fictional ones.<br />I look forward for the book 3.<br />Thanks<br />Sim
B00BWJ91XK|5.0|This was a great movie.  If you liked the other Lord of the Rings movies, you will love this one as well.  It was great to go back and pick up the back story of Bilbo Baggins.  Seems to follow the book pretty well, but its been awhile since I have read it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Even though this game is fun to play, these types of games have one thing in common; you have to pay real money for the extra perks to be able to advance through the various game levels. It will nickel and dime you to death!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game makes you think but I like that kind of games so if you like strategy games this is a good game  for you
006202406X|5.0|Veronica Roth manages to create a new world with such depth of detail...I love the commentary on society and human nature!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|There were so many characters that came and went from this show, and they were all so interesting. The acting was superb. We could not wait to watch the next season, to see what finally happened to our favorite characters. Come on you DEA agents, figure it out!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|play till I win every morning.  Change out the game.  Have my grandiose photo as background.  love it.  I recommend it.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This series really pulled us in and we could not stop watching it. Walt and Jessie were both so powerful to watch together. I have bought the whole series and am sharing with my family, not grand kids though! Very adult!
6305657947|4.0|This update, although good, like most remakes it is not as good as the original and don't believe I would recommend it to others.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was written differently but it was still so good! Definitely a great ending to the trilogy. Can't wait to see the movie for Divergent
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|Nice for a free product.  Throughout the day, I like to check the status of my investments. I don't need to make changes. Updating the stock when my dividend drips is a minor inconvenience, but can live with that. Downside of the app is the news feed. I didn't get the app for the news.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Such a disappointing end to what could have been my favorite series! Almost wish I would not have read them!
B009JZWO3I|4.0|But when I do, I try to make it count. For a cable TV show, this is very well written, well acted, fun to watch, and I appreciate the politics.  It's also one of few shows that is consistently good across seasons.
B004478AS4|4.0|An interesting book. Full of allegories concerning native beliefs, culture, religion and symbology and what happens when they meet western \\"civilization\\" and militant Christianity. It's a book entirely unlike most I've read.
0763644765|5.0|Apparently babies are supposed to be potty trained at 2 1/2 these days (per day care).  My daughter is almost 2 so we're working on this.  She loves this book (I don't know why she identified the androgynous baby as a boy, but I just read it to her as a 'girl' a few night in a row and that changed).  I read to her every night and this is one of her favorites, often we read this three times before she goes to sleep.  (Also 'Everybody Poops').  But 'Potty' is number one right now.
0062278096|5.0|Well...I wish I hadn't spent the money, only to find out that this is the Sherlock &#34;Casebook&#34;, just with a different title. But seeing as I had the Casebook first, I can say that if you don't have that, then this is a GREAT companion to the series. And the little post it notes give a great little peek at Sherlock and John's off screen relationship.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Getting the hang of this and loving it.download it and get started. You will love it too. I think I might get hooked.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I'VE loved every game in this series, they keep getting better and better.  I would suggest this to everyone, happy gaming.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally candy crush saga has come kindle.  made my day when I was able to download. It is an awesome highly addictive game that I enjoy quite a lot.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I DON'T have to rely on PEOPLE I DON'T know. I can get my friends to play it without the bullying and harassment. I see the progress. It's nice to root them on. I enjoy playing it with my husband and friends across the world on Facebook.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|I haven't laughed this hard in a while. It is full of both action and comedy. The special effects were not bad at all either. Then again, I am a major Ryan Reynolds fan. As usual, he does not disappoint. This movie will be added to my DVD collection.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|Same thing here but less serve probably a different monitor the TL PLAYERS better. But still had some harassment and internet bulling. Here I was trying to get away from these PEOPLE but you can get free gems, gold , coins, and etc... so most play all the games. Pokes making fun of my personal information was totally inappropriate but they were not ban or shut down and couldn't play for 3 days. Oh no that was there job. In my job if I sent ANY of the emails they sent to me or made up. I would be fried on the spot. No questions answered or asked. Your PEOPLE need training in the etiquette in communication over the computer which is a one dimensional view. SO a lot of people are very brave due they are not mature enough or experience to understand you need to be saying things you would if you were talking to that person face to face. It dehumanized the person on the side. Anything I have said on your game I could tell whoever I was talking to to there face. JUST remember that in reading this review. I still have pictures and code of your PEOPLE s access. Due to as user I cannot do all the stuff to my walls name.
B0013F1D02|4.0|For a love story it actually wasn't that bad. It was entertaining and actually had some action. I don't know if I would buy it, I don't really like love stories. However, I wouldn't mind watching it again some time.

1594202273|5.0|This is an extraordinarily well-written and valuable work. Schlosser synthesizes a vast amount of primary and secondary literature about the management--and mismanagement--of the U.S. nuclear weapons program over the last 70 years, as well as providing a deeply-reported (including interviews with survivors), brilliantly-written, gripping account of one of the most serious nuclear accidents to ever befall the U.S. military at an Arkansas Titan II missle silo in 1980. This was just one &#34;normal accident&#34; among many in the long history of the nuclear arms race, whose complex and tightly-interlocked social and technical systems guarantee not just routine failures but cover-ups and denial by the rigid bureaucracies (in the Soviet Union and elsewhere, not just here) needed to administer nuclear weapons. The decades of refusal by both Amerca's civilian and military leaders to implement proven safety measures for our ever-more-lethal and failure-prone weapons systems is truly frightening. Yes, no nuclear accident has yet resulted in the detonation of a weapon, but that's not proof it can't happen. Indeed, Schlosser demonstrates just how close we've come and how lucky we've been so far--and why our luck is almost certain to run out at some point..
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game it's so addictive and even better  now that they have the weakly challenges. The only thing I would change is asking if your sure you want to use your coins before using them. I hit the button and used coins when I didn't want more then once,but even with that I LOVE THIS GAME
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|unlike other programs I've tried Clean Master actually works without causing problems.  my S2's limited RAM benefits from regular sweeps and being able to exclude programs is great -- other programs I've used kill processes that just restart immediately and that seems to drain the battery faster.  my craptastic first-gen nexus 7 with 32GB responds better/faster with regular RAM sweeps and removal of junk files and, like I said,  Clean Master hasn't caused problems like other programs have.
B0067R0APK|4.0|It's a good app, but does not transition well and each link takes time to load. The ability to minimize the graphs is a nice feature.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It helped me clear up nearly a gigabytes (sp?) On my kindle fire HD. It's safe and simple. Worthy of a five star review.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I feel like a dork, but this game is fun. Who doesn't love minions? I like that there are mini games so it keeps the game interesting.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Wow, this was a good book! I wasn't sure because sometimes the &#34;next chapter&#34; just doesn't have the same feel. This book started a little slow, partly because it's been so long since I read The Shining, I had to familiarize myself with the characters again, which didn't take too long as there were only 3 old ones (except for the ghosts).  Great characters and wonderful insight into how your mind can convince you to do anything, good or bad.  I don't want to give much away, but would recommend this book to those who read The Shining and those who didn't.  If you read it, it is a great way to find out what happened next, but if you didn't read it, you won't be lost because in many ways this is its own book, it just happens to have characters some of us remember.<br /><br />Enjoy this one, you will have a hard time putting it down.
0767919408|5.0|During the Roaring Twenties the United States was a growing industrial and economic superpower.  Although there were danger signs in plenty that the good times were coming to an end, most Americans assumed that the growth trajectory that had been rising for years would keep doing so forever.  The Twenties were a heedless and hedonistic time for many (though certainly not all) Americans, and Bill Bryson has chosen to chronicle the summer which most epitomized the period as a way of giving us a snapshot of the entire dazzling era.<br /><br />Perhaps the most famous American in the summer of 1927 was a slim young man named Charles Lindbergh, who in May became the first man to fly across the Atlantic solo.  Perhaps the next two most famous were the President, Calvin Coolidge, and the man who hoped to become the next President, Secretary of State Herbert Hoover.  Ranking somewhere right in there, and perhaps ahead of the politicians, were Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey.  Bryson does an excellent job of detailing the lives and careers of these famed individuals, but does even better in his descriptions of the &#34;also rans,&#34; the men and some women who never quite managed to grab the spotlight.  People such as Paul Redfern, who disappeared trying to become the first man to fly from the US to South America, or Oris and Mantis Van Sweringen, who made (and later lost) a massive fortune, are just as emblematic of the 1920s as their more famous rivals, and Bryson gives them the attention they deserve.  Bryson also does a good job of examining some of the darker moments of the 1920s: the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, for example, or the appalling ignorance and bigotry displayed by such famous men as Henry Ford.<br /><br />One Summer is a pleasurable read, filled with fascinating and illuminating anecdotes.  It should be ranked with William Allen White's classic Only Yesterday as an essential tool for understanding the US as it was during the Roaring Twenties.
B00005214X|5.0|Sounds like George is right here.  I regret not ordering it earlier.  A very good investment.  High quality.  Superb value.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hard to stop once you start.  Love the different places.  Only complaint can't figure out how to beat meena. And vector and where is disco party.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|As many of us perhaps, I don't have time to sit down and analyze the episodes and come to a well-thought-out conclusion about how the series is doing. I sit down for 45 minutes at the end of a hectic day to escape ... and just experience it. I think there was a lot of hype about the \\"big new problem\\" of Season 4 which was overwrought; nevertheless, after not being so sure about purchasing the episodes on instant-view after season 3, the pilot for season 4 was so well-done and gripping that i bought the next 2 episodes. Neither of the 2 had the same effect on me as the first one. Perhaps the pilot was like tasting your favorite ice cream after being deprived of it for 6 months ... then, after the first rush, the thrill is gone. Let's see what episode 4 brings... but if it doesn't pick up I may drop it. Overall in episodes 2-3, it felt like there were too many slow scenes, close-ups of people crying over their situation, pauses in the pace whose reasons were unclear and without proper buildup ... just a bit boring.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Well formed characters. Entrancing story. Well worth the time to read. Please try it. I can't wait to see the movie.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|This season is definitely feeling a little forced. but at the same time im not going to complain. it have to say i am not ready to say goodbye to the characters but hope they are able to leave the show on a good note and not just drive it into the ground.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|I think the book had a message from which we could all learn, but I thought the characters were gullible and greedy. I just did not think the book was that great. I read it because I love Hologram for the King.
B00BT0ZS52|4.0|I have seen this movie like 3 times and i swear it is one of the greatest movies ever but i have no idea if im right...... this movie is either deep as the pacific or maybe they just stroked out writing this.<br />but still it was a good movie....... i think....... you should watch it though....... im hoping to find someone to explain it to me..........
B00G32OER4|3.0|Certainly entertaining, well made and well acted.  But for die-hard horror fans, there's a lot here to recognize.  Not a lot of originality, but the retro setting was clever.  I enjoyed it, but it IS a been there, done that.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This season is definitely holding up well. it is definitely keeping fresh and exciting into the 4th season. cant wait to see more.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I really liked the pace of the book, very easy to read and understand.  Thank you for putting a name to my resistance.
B00ENBTI8C|4.0|this season kept me guessing. i mean we all know in history that Spartacus dies in the end but the how was done really well. i wont give it all away but i was definitely focused on the screen in the last episodes.<br />That and when i bought it the price was insane cheap for the season so how can you go wrong.<br />oh and i do have to say that most of this really felt like a soft core porn. you could probably let up a little bit on that :-D lol
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very enjoyable game...keeps you searching for more. Great for keeping your mind sharp and eyes focused. I highly recommend this application.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|This movie was pretty bad ass. it had a little less substance than the book but what do you expect.<br />I loved the appearance of the new doctor who playing a W.H.O. doctor. amazing!!<br /><br />(spoiler sort of)<br />was a little disappointed they didn't use the books salutation where they retreated into the cold so the zombies would freeze.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|GREAT TIME KILLER ! REALLY STIMULATES THE BRAIN !!! SO ADDICTIVE AND A LOT OF FUN ! YOU GOTTA TRY IT !
B00E1LAS42|4.0|This movie is a must see. i wouldn't call it the best but you still have to see it some time. the idea and plot obviously lack some of the larger complication and complexities of a modern story but its a classic one that made all those possible. the movie is well worth purchasing in HD because the visuals are very good they put together.<br />Definitely worth watching old sport
B001KZG99A|5.0|Great movie! My son wanted to watch it over and over. Action filled!! I would recommend this movie! Can wait see the other Iron Man movies.
B009EE0SC8|4.0|some of the Xmen sequels were pretty weak but this is a pretty good one. they did pretty good with the origin on wolverine.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|I thought I would be put off by the sad circumstances of both characters.  Instead, I found a beautiful story of a friendship that develops between two dissimilar people.  Each was willing to take a chance on the other, when in the beginning it did not look promising.  Friendships are often risky business.  These two men embraced the risk and enriched each other's life.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|I really liked this film. love the ideas they use and Tom cruise is a pretty big bad ass. i hear the people who read the book didnt like him as the choice but he is still pretty cool.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Good  great read, funny story, girl is very easy to relate to. Would recommend this book to read to anyone
B009GED3HS|5.0|thought this was going to be the last season. you could feel that they are about to lose the charm of the show but it holds true in most of the episodes. still definitely a funny show.<br />NPH is the man
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great action movie. Maybe not as good as the first Iron Man, but all of the characters together are great.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|Verry good season. loved it<br />i wish they would stray from the relationship stuff and get back to nerdy science stuff more but character progression blah blah blah.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Dear Lord. I didn't think it was possible, but you actually created a game that makes me want to break my Kindle. HUGE memory hog, annoying sounds, and not that great of gameplay. PASS.
B008Y6RFBE|5.0|This is probably one of his best films. seriously good. if you havent seen it you are a monster :-) lol and if you haven't seen it in the past 5 years do yourself a service and see it again.
B00E208506|5.0|Will Ferrell is a genius and this movie is a delight for all ages. I watch this every holiday season with my son, and I am eager to see what is on the Blu-Ray 10th Anniversary Edition. I have the Infinifilm DVD version loaded with extras, and almost bought the current Blu-Ray version but I will wait and see what extras are available. Excellent cast (Newhart, Deschanel, Caan, Steenburgen, Dinklage are just the first five to come to mind) supporting Ferrell and IMHO the best thing Jon Favreau has directed, not to slight his other great films. Eagerly awaiting this gem that is watchable anytime of year. Thanks, Mr. Narwhal!
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I liked this movie a lot. i do feel that they made khan a little too super human for my liking.... but it was still pretty damn good sci fi. i do think the color pallet used in the fils sometimes dampens the amount of visual stimulation received from the film. i think back and remember dark sets and blue everywhere. makes for an interesting film but make my brain want to go to sleep.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great app.  Very addictive.  Having to wait for your lives to generate always keeps you hungry for more game play.  Especially on the more difficult levels.
B009YMKL4A|4.0|most of the sequels in this franchise were a little flimsy. thought i was going to give up when they started classifying them by class number :-P but this one is pretty cool.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game has the components seen in other hidden object games but offers so much more.  The mini puzzles are challenging and fun, the graphics are wonderful and the story line is intriguing.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Sometimes frustrating, but a fun game overall.  keeps you on your toes. Nice to see how friends are doing too. Really hate when I get stuck, but I guess that's what makes it a challenge.
B00AHHODH2|3.0|Light, fun read. Plenty of diverse characters with mini adventures that might lead to their death or not. I love the dogs, too!
B00000ING2|5.0|This movie can be used as entertainment or as an educational supplement at the high school level. We used it in our Economics classes.

B00DWZHTOU|5.0|It was a fantastic movie. I was caught offguard by the ending. The special effects were outstanding. It was well worth the money.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|During the fall of 1978, the devil came home - to Haddonfield, Illinois.<br /><br />Upon its initial release, Halloween had difficulty finding its traction with moviegoers, but after a few positive reviews, John Carpenter's horror flick was off and running.  Even more spectacular is that fact that the film was produced on a ridiculously tiny budget of $325,000, eventually cashing in big with an impressive $70 million.<br /><br />By now, most everyone is probably at least vaguely familiar with the concept of the boogeyman and quite possibly even well-acquainted with the boogeyman himself - the man in the white mask that walked around stalking babysitters, Michael Myers.  This cold-hearted killer has engrained himself in pop culture, creating legions of fans, endless merchandise, and several sequels featuring the character, including two reboot films.  Myers is the villain everyone loves to hate, having been forged into the spitting image of evil - unrelenting in his mission to stalk and eventually eliminate his prey.<br /><br />The creation of the Michael Myers, one of the most iconic and recognizable characters in the horror genre, leaves little doubt that Halloween is the greatest horror film ever created.<br /><br />Directed by John Carpenter (Assault on Precinct 13, The Fog) and co-written with Debra Hill, Halloween stars Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, who along with her high school friends, Anne (Nancy Kyes), and Lynda (P.J. Soles), is stalked by an escaped murderous mental patient, named Michael Myers (portrayed by five different actors, including Nick Castle & Tony Moran).  Desperate to find him before he kills innocent people in the small town of Haddonfiled, Illinois, Myers' doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), sets out to stop him.  However, Myers' whereabouts is unknown to everyone, except for two young children, Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews) and Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards).  Charles Cyphers also stars in a supporting role as Sheriff Leigh Brackett.<br /><br />Halloween is not only the best horror film ever created, but it's also the most important horror film ever created - okay, maybe it's the second most important film, slightly behind Psycho.  Following in the footsteps of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Halloween continues the trend of a modern day killer unleashing his fury on the innocent women of suburbia.  Both of these films took the simple premise of a mysterious killer shadowing beautiful women - just before mutilating them, and made it, well - hip and frighteningly entertaining.  There's just something so nail-biting and downright creepy about a man lurking in the shadows waiting to strike a moment's notice.<br /><br />While Halloween is responsible for elevating the career of director John Carpenter, it's also responsible for introducing Jamie Lee Curtis - the (at the time) unknown daughter of \\"scream queen\\" and Psycho star, Janet Leigh.  The amount of screen time devoted to her character was quite sizable, regardless of the fact she'd never acted in a feature role.  Regardless, Curtis demonstrated the scared, vulnerable qualities required to be the leading lady in this unnerving, often unpredictable slasher flick.  She's innocent, likeable, and had the make-up of a future Hollywood star - even though it's safe to say no one could have predicted the future roles she'd amass.  She would go on to star in several popular films, including True Lies, Trading Places, and three Halloween sequels (Halloween 2, Halloween H2O, and Halloween: Resurrection).<br /><br />Today, John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis are the top names that casual movie lovers typically associate with Halloween, but let's not forget that back in 1978, there was only one star of Halloween (pre-release): Donald Pleasence.  As the hard-nosed Dr. Sam Loomis, Pleasence has the film's most memorable lines, including the famous \\"...the devil's eyes\\" line.  He took on a role that he was incredibly uncertain of at the time - and wasn't even thefirst choice for the character.  As such a low-budget production, Halloween was unable to gain the interest of original sought-after, popular actors Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.  Still, Pleasence turned out to be the right man for the role of Dr. Loomis - which quickly became the role that would define the rest of her career.  His professionalism illuminates this role as the overly concerned doctor, and he obviously become a fan favorite - which is never more evident in the way he returned to the role for four sequels (five Halloween films in total).<br /><br />The success and legacy of Halloween led to the creation of several similar, yet moderately unique horror films, including Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street.  Regardless of the success of those individual franchises, Halloween still stands out as the one film that jump-started the slasher craze of the 1980s and beyond.  Without Halloween, there's little doubt that the more recent horror franchises, like Scream, Saw, and a slew of easily forgettable knockoffs, would have enjoyed the same successes that they achieved.  And, while the slasher \\"craze\\" is currently non-existent (at least for the moment) from overuse and a lack of progressive originality, there's little chance Michael Myers won't rise from the ashes again one day to stalk babysitters (or his female relatives if you liked the direction of the sequels).<br /><br />Overall and on its own, the original Halloween is the best and most important horror film ever conceived or created.  Even today, the story is as solid as ever, but the acting, camera shots (in which we see through the killer's eyes), and imagination also have withstood the test of time.  Sure, the film owes some of its success to Psycho, but the character of Michael Myers/The Shape/The Boogeyman has taken on a life all its own - which eclipses the wildest dreams of his creators.  The fan base of Halloween is strong, despite that fact that the original conception might not be as scary to this generation as it was the previous generations.  Although the inclusion of several sequels to the franchise certainly diluted the original storyline, Halloween will forever and always be one of the greatest films (and not just of the horror genre) to ever grace the big screen.<br /><br />GRADE: A<br />FNDNreview.comfirst choice for the character.

B00FI7XBIS|3.0|A good three stars.  This title is a timely Halloween treat but I can see it will be tedious as you increase in levels and finally boring when you reach an impasse' with a difficult level.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! I play every chance I get. It's very addicting.. I just got it for my Kindle. I was very excited about that.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this game a whole lot. Some levels are really hard and levels are easy. Everyone should like to play this game.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Divergent and Insurgent were unbelievable!!!!! This fell flat on its face. I am so disappointed, and so sad that it wasn't worth it. Big waste of time for me.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very moving, gripping story, I could not stop reading until the last page.  Would highly recommend this story to all.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The master of macabre, Stephen King, at his usual best!<br />Loved the characters and storyline - didn't want to put it down!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The Weaphones WWII Firearms app is reaaly well made, interesting and fun. Its facinating how many different ways of incorporating mag releases, safety catches and cocking bolts there are. Add to this excellent, realistic graphics, gun flashes, cartridge ejections, jams and recoil and you have an absorbing and entertaining gun app. A great array of different and unusual weapons just leaves you wanting to play with even more.
B005K17RU0|4.0|So far I have been pleased with the accuracy of the information provided. Easy to switch between a variety of locales.

B00ECR7KX2|5.0|I'm already a fan of Whedon, and of Shakespeare so for me this was a lovely hybrid.  The cast is amazing - must see for literature buffs
B007N579X6|5.0|Kids enjoyed and keep repeating it with friends and family.  Good quality 3D and surely fun to watch. Select few 3D movies explore the 3D.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am ashamed to have waited so long to read this. A novel which legitimately has impacted my life. For the better.

B00E7Z7D2M|1.0|Boy..Robert you really missed the mark on this 1. After being blown away with his 1st effort to try & bring some fresh air to the music scene today, how could you make such a repetitious album as Black Radio 2? Listening to it song after song straight thru & it becomes very redundant. For one thing he tried so hard to include to many artist from todays' music that the talent of his band was complerely left out. Especially when you consider that many of todays' artist have neither the mature quality in vocal range, pitch, tone & pipes (vibrato) of yester-years young stars (sad to say but true). Even his piano playing lacks much innovation as on his 1st album. Additionally, the drumming was very disappointing. After a few cuts in, I was about to pull my hair out from all the repetition. I have noticed from some of the reviews it doesn't take much to satisfy todays' audience because of their lack of exposure to quality sounds but for Jazz purist &/or those who you are more familiar with 'thinking man's music', this 1 is definitely not making it.

This work is not just for entertainment purposes, nor do I consider it fiction. Everything this man writes about is backed by scripture. The bibliography of this work contains another 20 years of reading by itself. A credible endeavor undertaken by a rising star in the literary world.

B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I waited until the price of this app was reduced to 99 cents.  I played in the late afternoon yesterday-played while my vehicle was being serviced - and just finished it.  There is a lot to do.  The hidden objects can be well hidden.  Some of the games were easy and others harder.  All in all this game kept my interest.  Loved the graphics and the story line for each painting.  Did not like the background music or the ending.

1451613512|5.0|There's a reason why these facts aren't highlighted/mentioned at all in grade school history books. If the American public knew of these things from a young age, there would be a LOT less nationalism.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Awesome book. May God continue to bless her life. My heart ached while reading this story and also rejoiced. A must read !
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I'm a sucker for live action superhero movies, particularly Marvel movies. So keep in mind that I enjoy these movies a lot because I like action and visuals over plot twists. I also appreciate these movies for what they are and I don't expect them to be frame-by-frame, exact audiovisual replicas of the books or comics that they are based on. I think that such an expectation is unrealistic and always prone to disillusionment.<br /><br />Edwin O. Eschberger (a fellow Amazon.com reviewer) gave a great review that reflects pretty much all my thoughts about this movie.<br /><br />In brief, the action was insane, just what I'd expect from Superman and what I feel that the last Superman movie had absolutely lacked. I enjoyed the new angle to Superman, it felt a bit more like a Sci-Fi movie than a superhero movie, in a way.<br /><br />Bottom line: watch this movie and be your own judge. I think that the negative reviews come from people who are way too attached either to old ideas of Superman, whether from previous movies or from the original comics.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|I love this game..having a lot of fun playing pool. However, when on You are sinking your last ball you can't follow in the 8 ball as a combo. You lose automatically. Lame
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Angry birdies return with a twist - you can choose sides. More fun than ever, some are VERY challenging. That said, the character scheme is a bit too complex for me - I prefer straight up play. Devotees will love it though, I'm sure.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|1. If you read Insurgent more than a year ago and are thinking you'll need to freshen up on the story before reading Allegiant, don't bother! Just stay in your happy book world and move on to something else.<br />2. Never pre-order books. I wish I had waited to order it until after it had come out. I definitely would have saved myself the disappointment.<br />3. Yes, the ending is awful. I definitely like closure, but this was like closing the lid on a container of bad milk and putting it back in the refrigerator.<br />4. The shifting points of view, while well-done and insightful in some novels, were not so in Allegiant. Rather, the shifts often brought me out of the story to make the transition. Additionally, they signaled early on that Tris and Tobias may be separated at some point in the story. As I remarked to a friend after the first couple of chapters, \\"It makes you wonder why she needs to separate their stories. They're obviously not going to end up together.\\" While it wasn't enough to predict the actual ending, it raises red flags to alter the format in this way at this point in the series.<br />5. The characters and plot elements were not well-developed this time around. I felt almost as though she was rushing to get through, to squeeze together everything she wanted to include and just brushing over details when possible.<br />6. Think about why people read these kinds of books. There's an expectation to deliver a certain kind of product in this market. This is not the best medium if it's all about artistic expression or getting out a message.<br />7. Boo.... I'm so disappointed.
B00G8YZ48K|4.0|As the flu ravages inside the prison, the survivors have to manage a bunch of sick people, quarantine seems to be their attempt to hold the progression of such disease. It has proven ill to contain the sickness, and yet there is hope in a natural remedy.<br /><br />The zombies seem to be lurking abroad, and what impresses more about this episodes, probably one of the few things relevant, is the mass migration that is about to occur.<br /><br />Will the survivors find a way to hold their ground in the upcoming disaster?<br /><br />We shall see!!

B004DMNT2W|4.0|I purchased this case from Amazon.com to use with my Sony Handycam. The camcorder fits quite well in this case and has stayed protected for months. I wish there were a little zippered pocket to store extra memory cards, but instead there is a sleeve out of which the cards could easily slip out and get lost.<br /><br />The strap is quite useful, although I'm not sure how securely the velcro would keep the case latched onto a belt or another object. I recommend the product.

This production, by itself, will probably stand alone for another century.  Do not miss this film!  CHRONLOGICAL AGE IS NOT THE MEASURE OF LEADERSHIP APPITUDE!  AT WHAT PRICE, VICTORY?  NJMJr!

0385351399|4.0|Eggers hits you over the head with the premise; a world in which everything is transparent.  Everything you do is tweeted, reviewed, discussed, and awarded with smiles or frown in a not-too-distant future.  Does this make for a better world?  Would you want your life examined at such a level - with no time to be alone or free from the judgment of millions?<br /><br />These are some of the questions that the book poses.  I have a soft spot for dystopian fiction like this and I like Eggers' previous books, especially the non-fiction post-Katrina piece Zeitoun, but this one rings hollow in several ways.  The characters are relatively shallow.  The premise of the book hits you over the head repeatedly as do the answers to the thought-provoking questions posed above (hint, the answers are all 'no').  A more subtle approach that looked at the effects of a gradual transparency might have been more interesting, but I still enjoyed this as a cautionary tale.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I read the Shining a long time ago, and honestly, it really is the movie version that sticks in my mind when I think about the story. Fortunately, I was able to jump into Doctor Sleep with no problems. I am glad we get an update on Danny, but the book could have also stood on its own. So many years have passed, some of the references back to Overlook weren't even necessary for me. Reading this book was a bit nervewracking, which is also pretty fantastic. Any book you are reading before you go to bed and you have to put down because you know you won't sleep well if you continue is probably doing its job. Several times during the course of reading it I had to turn off my Kindle, do something else, then come back to it because I didn't want to see what happened next, but then I had to know! It wasn't my favorite Stephen King book, but the story sucked me in and kept me power reading to the end.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|One of the nicest things about this album is that it's not 'over' produced. You get Susan's voice clearly and it's evident she is relaxed as she goes through the album. Nice mix of songs. Well done, Ms Boyle

0060589469|4.0|This book offers a lot of philosophical ideas and definitely gets you thinking. I love that motorcycles and the maintenance of motorcycles serves as the medium for ideas. It is a deep book that requires retrospection to fully understand or at least for me it did.
B006O6F932|4.0|I was fortunate enough to find this on sale today at K-mart for $35.99. I couldn't pass it up. Even though the picture clearly shows the size in comparison to the dolls, it still amazed me at how large it really is. Folded it is about 5(d) x 14 (l) x 18(h), expanded it is roughly 23 x 30 x 25.5(at peak). I bought it for myself as a display for the dolls that I do have.<br /><br />It is gorgeously detailed and the items are so easy to assemble but, the rest seems to fall a bit flat. If things aren't just right, everything starts to shake. The gargoyles are made of a soft plastic which won't hold their books, the stairs can sometimes come off if not placed just so and the middle dividing wall will wobble if the outer latch isn't fastened properly.<br /><br />The huge negative I have against this set is the main feature of the portability function. Sure, it folds up, but the lockers only hold the small items. There is no way to even carry the desks, bench, table, etc. even with them taken apart. I happened to have some bags with a hanging hook and some snaps that I managed to work to fit the objects into and hang off the side windows. I just don't understand why they didn't include something along those lines to begin with. Who wants to fold up a playset and have to find another box/bin/bag to put the large accessories into so the playset can actually be used?<br /><br />Overall I love it as a display. Perhaps one day I'll have children who will play with it, but for now it will just sit on my shelf helping my dolls look nice.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Kind of a Robinson Crusoe on Mars story.  Very good character development and fast paced read.  Ended a bit abruptly but wasn't disappointed.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is really fun and cute! I am hooked on it and play constantly! Not for kids only. I am 47 and I really enjoy it!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I started watching from season 1 and got hooked. Each season is better than the last one. Great writers and great acting. Love the series.
B008JEJN8O|5.0|These are the most comfortable ones yet.  I have several styles but these have more cushion I wear them as house shoes
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I really loved it. It's exciting, great plot and each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat. You're always looking forward to next episode.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|this movie is amazing but so sad there is a great ending also but you wish you didn't watch it it is an emotional movie
B005544TRQ|5.0|The characters and plots of this series TV show on USA network are both fun and interesting.  The characters have flaws that most can identify with which endears them.  I've hate the spate of lawyer and prosecutor shows on the networks over the past 20 years but this is not like them.  The format moves fast and there are situations that are less dark and nasty and more humorous and likeable.  One cannot help but like the Harvey Spector character, he is what we would all love to be like....smart, sharp dresser, confident and successful...and yet is a good guy who does the right thing when pushed by his associate and also interesting character Mike Ross.  You love Jessica and yet hate her pushiness.  You hate Louis and yet have to like him.  Those twists of the characters can only come from a well written and acted show.  For the gals...good looking Harvey and Mike...for the guys...Rachel and Donna. This is (as Sam Ax in Burn Notice likes to say) &#34;must see&#34; TV.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has again written a book that I couldn't quit reading!  It is so interesting, and so well written.  Thank you.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|This is a nice scroller that seem child freindly.  The graphics are nice and it is not too hard to control. I like it and would recommend for children.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I downloaded the instruction as an Adobe Acrobat Reader file. It is very clear, concise and to the point. I am currently putting the finishing touches on my manuscript using MS Word. The instructions are quite detailed where necessary, but very readable throughout, good job!<br /><br />I feel there could be a bit more guidance, two pages at most, on Copyrighting, ISBN's and the Library of Congress' Preassigned Control Number program and other necessaries to protect authors' rights.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|I first got this game on PC, and loved it. When I saw it came to kindle, I was ecstatic. I play this game a lot now, and have had no problems with it, other than getting addicted to it. The only suggestion or request I have, is more maps, and characters like the PC version. Other than that, awesome game, highly recommended!
B0006GAOCW|5.0|This is such a sweet wonderful movie for girls of all ages...family too!!<br />Fathers should watch this if they want their daughters to stay close to family and especially him.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Great movie glad we bought it. Claire Danes is terrific in her roll. The quality is top notch. I don't know anyone with Autism, never-the-less it was fascinating.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was....words can't describe the feelings I had while reading this book! I do now now thing...this book has reinforced my belief that anyone running for President should have had to serve in our military! Thank you Marcus for sharing your story. You are a true hero!
B008602KQI|5.0|Every bit as good as the book. I look forward to the next movie and I will be adding it to my video Library.
006202406X|1.0|So I decided to wait to write my review to let it all sink in, i thought maybe i just needed time to accept the ending. I have to say my feelings on it haven't changed. I read for two reasons, escape and enlightenment. To be able to really get into a story I need to be emotionally invested in the characters, Insurgent and especially Divergent did that. I cared about Tris and Four, I wanted them to be together. I cared about what would happen to them, thier motivations, actions and pain mattered to me. I felt none of this in Allegiant, that's what disappoints me most about this book. It didn't evoke the emotions of the other two. I couldn't even be upset at the ending. I do agree with the reviewer that said having her survive the death serum to fall prey to the memory serum in her weakened state would have been better. That's an ending that I would have enjoyed. This books ending just left me wondering why I read it.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|Easy access to a wonderful program.  Each episode is well thought out the writing is great and the cast are all excellent in their acting abilities.<br /><br />Each story line gives one points to ponder in real life situations.  Good lessons, again fantastic cast.
1401324649|4.0|Excellent quirky story - have given copies to several friends and lent out my copy - frequent laughs all round.
1476727651|5.0|This was an amazing book.  I am truly thankful that he wrote this for us.  It was a great story.  AMAZING!!!!
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|No one expected that the sequel to \\"The Shining\\" will be as good as the first book, but it's still very good. Not masterpiece maybe, but King at the peak of his skills. Not as scary as \\"The Shining\\", but you can not tear yourself away from reading to the last page.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews on this movie. I personally loved it. Matt Damon had 3 chances to make me like Jason bourne and he failed all 3 times. Jeremy Renner succeeded in just one shot with Aaron cross. If you're not a wannabe movie critic don't pass this one up. I'm glad I ignored the reviews.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love these chromecasts.  they are extremely easy to set up and function perfectly.  I have bought several of these and plan to buy more for the holidays.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|You can't beat a good writer. The story flows, the characters develope and you can't stopped turning the pages. A true Grisham.
B00B9PJ114|3.0|Pros:<br />Red Brown Leather is as shown in the picture<br />Leather is firm<br />Sole has good grip, thick, and looks durable (time will tell)<br />Not Heavy.  I have worn them about a week and they do not tire my feet.<br />Comfortable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Biggest issue is that they run bigger than the size that is marked.  I ordered a 9M, but they fit like a 9 1/2 wide.  I have 3 other pairs of Timberland boots that are 9M and these are wider.<br /><br />I would have given these boots 4 to 5 stars, but the loose fit is disappointing.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved the suspense and how all the characters are inevitably tied together. The depth of details is incredible and makes you want to keep reading. Fantastic ending in the epilogue, I love how she shows how things could have been. Great read! Would recommend it to anyone!
B0050SYS5A|3.0|Pros:<br /><br />Easy installation<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Did not see much improvement.  Our living room is medium size, and we still have to move our couch back 7 to 8 feet in order to play, which is about the same as without the Zoom adapter.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|This movie was an amazing thriller. I always loved Stephen king. I highly recommend. If you had read the dark tower u will love this as a great tie in
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and continually gets more challenging!  Enjoy the game and have trouble putting it down and doing something else once I get started..
B005MLOKXA|4.0|When I first heard of &#34;thegoodwife&#34;, I thought, just another lawyer show.  I started watching the program and WOW!, so not just another &#34;lawyer&#34; series.  Every episode is solid, the story line is interesting and the characters are believable.  A must watch.
B002APU580|4.0|Cast is wonderful in this most recent version of one of my favorite classic novels.<br />Loved the lead actors.  Beautiful cinematically.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is a good game and I am obsessed with the game it is so much fun and cheaper than I thought
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Game is not what friendly enough to play. hope i can fine another game that is not the one keep looking.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad this has finally came to the kindle. Love this game and play it daily<br />on my phone and now my kindle
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Drawing from newspaper headlines, articles, and meta-analysis of press coverage, Bryson places you into a longer news cycle than we know, and draws out the depth of the topics that captured, and held, the imagination of the country.  The strength of this book remains, as with most of his works, the comprehensive research and willingness to take a historical stand in interpreting events.  Many a train journey passed lost in thought in these pages.
0802473156|5.0|Love this book! Love Gary Chapman and all of his books. This is a must read for anyone looking to have healthier, deeper relationships.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I liked the ensemble cast and the plot was pretty good, as was the twist at the end. Fun to watch.
0880796863|4.0|I am a novice with Tarot, so it is difficult to predict (sorry, couldn't help myself).  Cards have beautiful, colorful artwork, card size is appropriate for handling.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Exactly what I expected and wanted.  Al the episodes and more wonderfull can't wait for the season 3 dvds. I<br />M a very happy camper
0804148937|5.0|great book.  enjoyed every minute. the entire story was captivating from beginning to end. I recommend it. so much enjoyment
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|It took up too much space on the device. It kept stopping and slowing down. The graphics look great. But what's the use when you can't enjoy it?
B001BANK32|5.0|Love this book!  One of Steven King's best.  Wanted to re-read it to get prepped for Doctor Sleep.  Worth it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have it on my kindle fire hd and my lg phone. They are both great to play on. I wish I could turn the sound off on the phone instead of having to turn my phone settings down so that I can't hear the music playing. Needs a way to turn sound off on both devices as it has it on my laptop. The game fits perfectly with the screen on both devices as it does not on my laptop. over all a great game to play even if it is frustrating at times. Wish I didn't need wii-fi to play it. needs to be like other games you can download. not on wii-fi
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|It is ok I wouldn't pay for it. I just wanted to get the free level. Still wouldn't pay for it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I won't go into major detail on how it works. I can say this:<br />-It's easy to setup<br />-Its easy to use<br />-its cheap in comparison to other options out there<br /><br />Few complaints:<br />-Google is starting to limit what you can do with it.  Locally hosted videos are not super easy to use, if you can open them in Google Chrome  you can stream it but you can't just stream from a video player.<br />-Amazon video is not easy to use with it.<br /><br />Buy one!  $35 and it does a lot
B00ATUEKY8|3.0|Interesting but not riveting... haven't finished it yet. (You require too many words for these submissions, blah, blah, blah, blah)
B000LC3ID8|4.0|I really like suspenseful and horrific movies, and this one is an amazing story line and actors. I do recommend it.
B005USZML4|2.0|Very easy to read. After a short while, you can expect the end. I was expecting more thrill and action.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|Love this anime! I could watch this series for days. If you like zombie shows this anime is perfect. Great story, great characters and a zombie apocalypse. Just what the doctor prescribed :)
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|great book - as always, well written and extremely thoughtful - a truly frightening vision of things to come (and are already)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|another great Stephen King novel. it has your attention from page one and  holds it until the final page.<br />if you like Stephen King, you're going to love this book.
B00005JKQ6|4.0|\\"The Swimmer\\" starts off very optimistically, as a well-preserved middle-aged man (Burt Lancaster, in terrific shape even at 55 years of age and looking somewhat \\"Kennedyesque\\") is inspired to live one late Summer/early Fall day as if his life was poetry.  He wants to make a pilgrimage across miles of his acquaintances' properties in suburban Connecticut, swimming in a string of backyard pools and one public facility, until he reaches his own backyard.<br /><br />Since Lancaster's Neddy Merrill is clad throughout the movie in only a swimming suit (except when he briefly doffs it in the backyard of some nudist buddies), it is really obvious that the story (adapted from John Cheever) is an allegory, and the protagonist is reenacting some kind of Homeric journey.<br /><br />Though Ned Merrill, the swimmer, initially receives a warm welcome in the early stages of his journey, increasingly he is rebuffed and scorned and it becomes clearer that Merrill's poetic vision is really a self-delusional fantasy.  What's more, Merrill injures himself early on when he is full of vigor and trying to cantor like a randy horse, and by the end of the film he seems nearly hypothermic and staggering towards his ruin.<br /><br />Someone once wrote a book about \\"The Peter Pan Syndrome\\", and the author may have received inspiration from this movie.  In one scene as Merrill confronts his ex-mistress (played by Janice Rule), she even queries of Merrill \\"how goes it in Never-Never-Land?\\"<br /><br />As an exercise in nostalgia and nausea, and a slightly hallucinatory exploration of a man's fall from grace, \\"The Swimmer\\" manages to be pretty effective.  Within every Eden is a hidden Hades, it tells us.<br /><br />On the downside, at times \\"The Swimmer\\" has the look of a made for TV movie, and the musical score by a young Marvin Hamlisch is pretty, but it veers close to the similar scores of Michel LeGrand, and gives the movie a \\"Sixties\\" feel that it can't shake off.
B0019NG73G|4.0|This is a review of both \\"Gettysburg\\" and \\"Gods and Generals\\". The ratings and titles are different.<br /><br />If it isn't obvious from watching these films, the director/screenwriter explains in an interview that they're intended to present an unbiased view of both North and South, without labeling anyone as good or bad, hero or villain. What then remains, he says, is the horror of war (though most of it is shown at a PG-13 level). What, then, is the /dramatic/ point?<br /><br />Little, it seems. It isn't until near the end of \\"Gods\\" * that Jeff Daniels says what needed to have been said at the start -- that he can't understand why Southerners rant on about freedom, when they live under a system that enslaves people. The Southern argument -- that their states are their countries -- is an accurate reflection of how people felt -- indeed, of how this country was conceived (in both senses of the word) -- but it pales in comparison with the facts that not only is slavery wholly unjustifiable (unless you believe that sub-human people exist solely to earn your bread for you), and that the war was fought over the spread of slavery. Those reaching for their keyboards to accuse me of political correctness are advised to refrain.<br /><br />The wide range of personal opinions on IMDb is not surprising. Northerners tend to see \\"Gods\\" as pro-Southern, Southerners as vindication. Neither is correct. But at a time when legislators -- many from Southern states -- are trying to exterminate the few vestiges of democracy that remain in this country -- neither film sits very well with this viewer. I would like to point out to Southern sympathizers reading this... You lost. Get over it. State's rights were trampled where they should have been trampled, and the Federal government affirmed its superiority over the states. Tough.<br /><br />As for who's the better Lee, Sheen or Duvall, the decision has to come down firmly on Sheen's side. Photos of Lee suggest a dark personality, and Sheen captures this better. Duvall is a strong person, and there is -- except for a few moments near the end -- little sense of weakness, or any ambiguity in his views. It doesn't help that Sheen has several scenes of strong dramatic interaction that allow him to display Lee's character -- Duvall has only one brief \\"dramatic\\" moment (which he handles well). Sheen's show of fear and anguish at the end of \\"Gettysburg\\" is played beautifully.<br /><br />Both films are worth seeing. But their attempts to present a dispassionate perspective weakens them. It might be /logical/ to ask us to show sympathy for people who are morally wrong -- but it implies that our actions are products of the Zeitgeist, uncontrollable forces we must bend to. But we can remain upright, if we choose.<br /><br />PS: To the person who says Sheen's performance makes Lee look like a nut... Imagine you're a general who has just sent thousands of troops to their deaths -- which you have witnessed. How would you react?<br /><br />* I interpret the use of \\"Gods\\" as referring to the different gods Northerners and Southerners worship. It's particularly striking (especially among the Southerners) how often they ascribe human events to God's will -- as if humans have no responsibility for their own behavior.een captures this better.

1936891026|5.0|Steven Pressfield puts into words what people need to hear about continuing to reach for their goals. It's a very motivating book, which makes it successful in its purpose. It strips away the excuses we all use to sit back and take the easier route in our lives. No matter what direction a person's goals take, this book gives the reader a much-needed boot in the rear to get up and make good on our dreams. Thank you, Steven Pressfield.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS<br /><br />So when this book first came out I was uber excited. But then I read some reviews and was shocked at the horrible reviews. And then I read the spoilers and learned the big wtf moment before reading the book. I didn't feel much like reading the book after learning about Tris. But I read anyway out of loyalty to the series with a glimmer of hope that all you people were just crazy for writing those 1 star reviews.<br /><br />Unlike the first two books I wasn't completely absorbed in Allegiant. My biggest complaint about the writing was the 2 POVs. I found myself in the middle of a chapter and turning to the beginning to see whose name was under the chapter heading. Tris and Fours narration was the same! There was no development of personality to differentiate whose point of view it was. If you're going to write a multiple narrative make sure each narrator has a specific voice.<br /><br />Now for the character issues. First let's start with the once badess Tobias. He was such a whiney little emo kid in this book. Okay we get it, you have daddy issues and now mommy issues but come on! He was such a strong character in the first two books. Now he's just a lost, vulnerable little kid.<br /><br />And where's the villain? Marcus was a good villain but David? There was nothing loathsome of frightening about David.<br /><br />From that stupid line Tobias told Tris about sacrificing your life to show someone  you love them, it was obvious that she was going to die. Stupid! If you love someone you do everything in your power to be with them. She said she didn't want  to leave him? Well don't go into a situation where you are basically walking to your death.<br /><br />This book wasn't without its plot issues either. Why do all the bad people get to live. Why does the David who just had his memory erased still control the program. Wouldn't the government want someone competent to run the bureau and not someone who is relearning who he is. Furthermore, he would just relearn the discriminating behaviour he had before against genetically damaged people. And how is David the ONLY one with access to the inoculation for the death serum? Then who made it? Here we have a government that is highly advanced at manipulating the human body and genes but they aren't scientifically advanced to revive uriah from his coma? Illogical.<br /><br />What VR should have written was instead of erasing everyone's  memories, have a rebel scientist (caleb, Matthew, any of those brains) create an inoculation for the death serum that could spread like a virus. Release that and the memory inoculation on Chicago. No one would die unfairly from Evelyn having an advantage on the death serum. And the allegiant and factionless would have it out like good old fashioned war and would eventually reach the treaty.<br /><br />My biggest problem was Tris' death. David was in the weapons lab because he was suspicious that she would be there because she had been hanging out with a lot of GDs. No kidding! Those are all her friends from Chicago. Who else does she know. Who else is she going to hang around in a new city. And if Caleb felt guilty enough for what he did to give his life then that's a good reason for a human sacrifice. If he didn't care about Tris then he wouldn't feel guilty for what he did to her.  People don't feel guilty over pain they've caused to people they don't love. Caleb should've died instead of Tris. Tris death was sad. I did cry a bit. But I saw it coming.<br /><br />A more tragic ending but also more suitable would've been if the the death serum had a debilitating effect on her. I'm not saying kill her. It could've shut down her ability to move, act, etc. She would successfully release the memory serum on the bureau but because the death serum debilitated her she wouldn't be able to fight off the memory erase. She would also lose her memory. Tobias would return to her and he would be a stranger. The real test of love would bethat they would have to start over again but now in completely different situations, being completely different people. And it would be a true sacrifice on Tobias' part to let Tris go until she was ready to be with him again. If she would ever be ready.<br /><br />I would give this book 2.5 stars. There have been worse books and this one could've been worse I suppose. Maybe the 2.5 is generous and only an overflow of my high star reviews for divergent and insurgent. Maybe i just didn't want to admit that it disappointed me.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|I got this movie off a recommendation from an all time movie list, and I wasn't disappointed. Interesting storyline with a big but fitting twist at the very end. I could see how SOME people would be put off by the ending though, as it will make you question your perception of what actually took place during the viewing.

0691130272|5.0|This book is definitely written at the researcher / graduate level.  It is chalk full of relevant references to the original material and provides a good starting point when learning a new topic.  The material is at times dense but most importantly it is mathematically complete.  Where mathematical or physical steps / logic are left out, appropriate references are provided.<br /><br />It is a stand alone text but I find that it works best in conjunction with other texts (such as Galaxy Formation and Evolution by Mo et al). Sometimes it is elucidating to read the descriptions by several good authors.  If you have a strange unreferenced equation, look in this book first!<br /><br />Below is an example of how I have used this text.<br /><br />This past week I've been trying to create a Galaxy model.  I was following the work of Springel, Di Matteo and Hernquist (2005).  At some point, they state an equation for the rotational velocity as a function of Bessel functions, with no reference.  After struggling to understand and derive the equation for a few hours, it occurred to me to look in this text.<br /><br />Binney and Tremaine derive this equation in Ch. 2.  The material is dense at times, but the derivation is complete.  They skip no steps and they provide invaluable references to the relevant original sources.  Without this book, I would have struggled much longer to solve my problem.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was unbelievable. Well-written and a real page turner. Now on my top 5 list. A little confusing at the beginning but it all comes together fairly quickly.Leaves you really thinking and questioning. A great read.
1616202416|5.0|I love this book. We read it for my English class and I wasn't sure how it would turn out. I am so glad that we read it! This story is so beautifully told. The characters are so real and by the end of the book I was so connected to these characters. I don't want to give anything away so I can't say overly much. The more you read this book the better it gets. Watching the changes in Kambili, the main character is just wonderful. She is such a delicate person, and her brother has an equally fascinating transformation. I really don't do this book justice, I strongly recommend it!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|All of my friends were playing and kindle finally got it. This game is full of fun. It pulls you in and not let you go.  I am hooked. Keep the levels coming!
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Thought the album was brilliant! Can't wait for more music from her.Wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I have.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I think even adults would like this game so if this game was on a scale of one to 20 it would totally. be a 20
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Loved it, can't wait to start on the next one. I cannot find any negatives that would describe this amazing book.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|The disc played perfectly and the kids loved it! I would  recommend this movie for fans of My Little Pony.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The Ka-Bar Becker BK2 Companion is one of the greatest survival knives in the world.  It is a quarter inch thick black beast of a knife that really eats anything that it is applied to.  I can't imagine how someone could break this knife.  That seems impossible.  It seems to be unbreakable, which is definitely something you want in your survival knife.  The durability of this knife is second to none.  When you feel what this thing feels like in your hand, it is an unbelievable feeling.  Imagine holding a crow bar or a pry bar in your hands with a sharp edge.  That's what this thing feels like.  I can't imagine a job that this knife cannot perform.<br /><br />With that being said, I am sure that there are many knives that would be better than the BK2 at utility tasks including cooking tasks.  The BK2 can do that for sure, but I would rather have a smaller and finer knife for such tasks like a Mora or a even a Buck 119 (a great all-around knife in its own right), but the Becker BK2 is a knife that can do a little bit of everything.<br /><br />One often hears the expression \\"jack of all trades but master of none\\", and I think that this a very unfair way to describe the Becker BK2.  Sure, it's not a great cooking knife, and the knife would not be the best choice for cleaning small game or fish or other finer tasks, but the BK2 could do those things if necessary; it's just not the best knife for those jobs.  However, for chopping and batoning, you can't ask for a better blade on a survival knife.  One thing that people forget to discuss is that we are talking about one (1) knife here, folks, and when you talk about one (1) knife for survival, one would be stupid not to consider the Becker BK2 as a top candidate for that job. Can an axe chop better?  Yes.  Can a machete hack better? Depending on the machete, yes.  Can a Mora handle fine food preparation better?  Sure.  But, if you are talking about one (1) knife to have if you were lost in the wilderness, I can't think of a better knife to have than the Becker BK2.<br /><br />I am surprised at that reaction to the BK2 though only because the BK2 is not only a knife, it is a pry bar/crow bar, shovel, hammer, camp axe, chisel, etc., etc.  In my opinion, the BK2 can do so many things that other knives can't do.  So, when you hear a lot of people call it a \\"jack of all trades\\" but \\"master of none\\", that is an unintentional compliment when you think about it.  In other words, that is a partial truth, but the irony is that a survival knife needs to be a \\"jack of all trades\\" because if you only have one tool, it needs to be able to do a little bit of everything.  To me, that is the beauty of the BK2.<br /><br />One more thing about all of the Kabar Becker knives is that while they are truly great knives, they are not stainless steel--which is partly why they are so great at tough tasks--but I'm in the south and it is often humid and wet, and the Becker knives will rust if not cared for on a regular basis with some WD-40 or mineral oil.<br /><br />One of the ideas behind survival is that you are not going to have your entire tool shed available to you, so would you rather have the BK2 or a Mora?  I like Mora fine, but give me the BK2 for survival.  This thing can chop a small tree down if you need it to.  And, like I said above, you cannot ask for a tougher and more durable knife than the BK2.  You just can't!!!  This is one of the ultimate survival knives on the market today, and if you could only have one (1) knife, this knife must be at or near the top of that list.<br /><br />As far as caveats goes, I must say that the knife is perfect in every single way except that it will rust if not cared for.  This particular type of steel will rust if you don't oil it with some mineral oil, WD-40, honing oil or something.  Second, this knife's sheath is pathetic.  It is a glass reinforced kydex or plastic.  This sheath will dull your blade just by putting the knife in and taking the knife out of the sheath.  Also, the little nylon belt loop is pathetic.  It is like trying to keep an elephant from falling off a cliff by tying its tail to a daisy.  It is a stupid sheath system for a great knife.  I highly recommend purchasing a custom style sheath for this blade or you're going to regret it.<br /><br />As far as comparisons go, the Becker BK2 is definitely on par with the Esee 5 and may be a better chopper although the Esee 5 is probably better for finer cutting tasks.  The Schrade SCHF 9 does not hold a candle to the BK2 and neither does the Condor Rodan, but those are good knives too though.  The Sog Creed is a good comparison survival knife, but I think that the BK2 is tougher although for chopping, the Creed is awfully tough to beat.  That being said, I think I prefer the black beast of this hybrid pry bar/knife called the Becker BK2 which inspires such confidence in its performance that you feel that you have an unstoppable piece of steel in your hand that cannot be broken.  That, in and of itself, is what you need when it comes to survival.  Take it from the Skill-Master who knows.<br /><br />If I could only have one knife, the Becker BK2 is as good of a knife (minus the sheath) as there is in the world today for survival purposes.  And, don't tell me that the Busse Hellrazor can do anything that the Becker BK2 can't do because it can't.  Sorry, but the Busse Hellrazor is just a waste of money compared to the BK2, and it is not as tough as the BK2 because it don't get no tougher.  For a good illustration of just how tough this knife is, check out TAGannon's video on youtube comparing the Becker BK2 and the Esee 5.  Skill-Master rates the Becker BK2 with the coveted 5-star rating cause it don't get no better!!!  I have two of these blades myself, and I have ordered custom made sheaths.  Highest recommendation, folks, and NO ONE knows more about what it takes to survive than the Skill-Master.e sheath.  Also, the little nylon belt loop is pathetic.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was suprised to find out the Orphan Train was in fact a real thing here in the US.
B00DVPN30A|5.0|I love this cd!  Not his best, but right up there!  Different sound from other albums but great - would buy anything Amos Lee will sing.
0547391005|5.0|My grandson loves George so we were so glad to find this in time for his birthday a few months back. He loves the stories and enjoys having us read to him. The book is quite big and full of beautiful illustrations. It's a great collection and one we'll keep for a long time.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Bought this GPS receiver to use with OpenCPN running on a Macbook Pro. I would recommend downloading the latest drivers from the site as I did have some issues using the driver supplied on the CD. Once the drivers are installed it is simply a matter of plugging in the device and configuring OpenCPN to receive the signal. I have used this device on a sailboat to navigate Lake Michigan without any problems at all. I can receive a signal with the device sitting on the navigation desk so don't have to worry about a wire dangling in the companionway while underway. Great product!
B000SXLL8O|5.0|One of their best albums overall and the one that hubby and I love to play. Enjoy most of the songs and will continue to look for more albums in the future.
0743201140|4.0|Yes, the book does a very good job in helping you how to discover your personal strengths. It does not say too much about what to do after you have discovered them though.
B00EZQJX76|5.0|Very well written with a great story line, Pollyanna is timeless classic which appeals to readers of all ages.  The movie with Haley Mills also does a wonderful job of portraying the book
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time it was so well writen, a heartwarming tale of two falling in love.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I cannot get basic weather in a quick or easy fashion.  Radar map useless.  Removing app. Used to b good
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For college students with WiFi, this is a great way to &#34;get cable&#34; without having to have a smart TV or a cable subscription. With Hulu, Netflix, and Pandora, this is a quick and easy way to get big-screen entertainment on a budget. I look forward to more capabilities, and the ease of sending items from your smartphone to the device is brilliant.
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|it's ok but its not as good as the regular sprinkle because this is free and the other is $4 dollars.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Got this to use with a portable Weber BBQ and it's really great for that.  We don't need a lot of charcoal with the small portable grill, and this is a great compact size for use with the smaller grills.<br /><br />If you are looking to use a chimney for something huge (e.g. a full size Weber) you will want to get a bigger chimney.
B004P7CNE0|5.0|Great movie at a very good price! I'm surprised this movie isn't known...I mean it is not worth a nomination or anything like that but it is a cool movie
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's challenging and original. I love that it has hints. It's suspenseful but not scary. We need more games this well made. I played the first one and the epilogue. Wonderful game. I'm excited for part 2!!
B002AS463W|5.0|Great movie, original version.<br /><br />Unfortunately there isn't a menu on the DVD but it ain't a big deal!!! Sexy & Sensual...
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Can't get enough.  Pink has soul and her songs brings out every feeling from hurt love hate dissappointment. Love it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This was multiple stories within a story.  It was virtually impossible to guess how they were all related.  This is a hard to put down book.  I will definitively read others in the future.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is the most fun that any one can have ever. I'm not joking it is really fun and I do not lie .
0756404746|4.0|The book, The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss is a book set in a mythological world of times where magic, science and music exist together at the same time. The setting and some of the story of the book remind me of a game I played last year called Skyrim. Skyrim is a game based in a similar setting, with various creatures that are similar to what are described in the book. In the book there is a spider like creature called a Screal, which is very similar to the frostbite spiders in the game, although in the game they're not as threatening. Another thing that reminded me of Skyrim was the massive amounts of magic used in the world written by Rothfuss, although much of the magic in the book is different from the magic in the game.<br /> The Name of the Wind is about a man named Kote who runs an inn in the town of Newarre. It's soon revealed that Kote's real name is Kvothe, a legendary hero who is currently hiding. Kvothe was a renowned musician, sword fighter, and musician who traveled the land, referred as the Four Corners of Civilization in the book. The author of this book is very detailed and descriptive of any important events that occur in the book. For example when the Chronicler gets threatened by Bast, Kvothe's assistant, small details like the furniture in the room changing, or the window being cracked open are detailed extensively using beautiful language. The story is truly inspiring with multiple plot lines, as well as several key events that are described in great detail flesh out the story, giving characters more personality making you more immersed in the story. This novel is truly a book of literary merit, providing the skill and aesthetics needed to write a great story.<br /> The story that Rothfuss wrote makes use the literary elements of setting and imagery immersing you into the world that the story is based in. The setting is described in great detail, providing a strong base of lore and time period the book is based on. For example, when the book begins, Rothfuss starts out with broad details, like the name of the inn, for example, which is Waystone Inn, and soon starts to fill in the lines of time period, and the general feeling and location that he's in. Some of these small details include the vernacular that the characters use when telling stories of events using words and conjunctions like \\"they'd\\" and \\"t'nother\\" immersing you into the setting similar to 10th century England. Rothfuss also makes use of the literary element of imagery, painting beautiful pictures of the setting and events while reading the book. For example, in chapter 13, Kvothe interrupts himself to get a drink, but the way that Rothfuss writes how Kvothe gets a drink, and interacts with Bast, his assistant, paints this descriptive setting and image in your head of how they would interact as if the characters on paper were like actors on a stage.<br /> While the book may seem like a gauntlet, with a staggering 736 pages, it is a great read, especially if you're into mythological stories. The story that Rothfuss tells using Kvothe and the Chronicler is great, being expansive as well as immersive, describing a new world that's very detailed. The book also has a great writing style making you feel like you're there experiencing the story that's being told, showing positive literary merit. If you're the type of person that likes to read long and immersive stories that involve mythological beings and magic, then this book is a perfect read!
B006H71C0C|5.0|Have loved this book for many years. I have had many guys who were not &#34;readers&#34; ask me over the years what book they should try.....this is always my first suggestion and almost always they will eat it up cover to cover, even those who have not read a book since high school.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Another great performance from Tom Cruise. Sean Pegg gave a great performance as well. The show did not disappoint in shot'em up action!
0307730700|5.0|My son had read Fearless about a year ahead of me.  I had my list of books to read and this was not one of them.  Finally one night, I asked him had he read any good books lately and he said \\"Dad, you gotta read Fearless!\\"  So that night I downloaded the Kindle version of the book and could hardly put it down.  I have read several other Navy Seal books, and they have been great reads, but this one was different.  The author focused on Adam's life and the struggles and victories that he had during his albeit short but full life.  Normally books don't move me to tears, but this one did.  Yes, the ending is extremely heart wrenching, but Adam's battles begin long before he ever arrives in Afghanistan.  This has to be one of the best books I have read in the last couple of years.  Yeah, next time my son tells me he has a book that I need to read, I won't doubt him.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Very addictive and lots of fun. Love the challenge and variety of puzzles. Definitely worth loading and playing.
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|Excellent fast paced novel. The outcome wasn't really known until you were almost at the end of the book. Great read.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Even I think that the game is great! This is a very good app and I think that it should be able for all ages. It is awesome!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a cross breed between bejeweled and heroin. Once you start you can't stop. Some levels are a real pain, but you keep trying.
B00EODUWQ6|3.0|Not a totally captivating book but scarily believable in the Orwellian use of language by the company known as 'The Circle'.  For example 'Privacy is Theft' is one phrase that underpins the slow erosion of individual liberties in favour of total transparency.<br /><br />Some predictable plot twists weaken the effect of the scare factor.<br /><br />Overall an interesting read.
B000002GB6|4.0|This CD I had years ago and I liked it then so when I lost the cd I knew I needed to get another CD.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|G. D. Roberts book is a stunning look inside worlds hidden to most experiences; the language is a symphony of visual beauty, love, contemplation and heart-wrenching violence. It is intellectually honest and in my opinion a masterpiece of uncovering the souls of many cultures. I truly could not put it down. What a breathtaking adventure!
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Got the first book and finished it in a day while on vacation.  So I ordered this one.  It is so funny and entertaining.  I don't read a lot so the book has to be good for me to not want to put it down.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|This recording lives up to its billing.  Amazing vocals and equally amazing guitar work with a fantastic band to make it all work.  This should be required listening to help people recover from such musical travesty as &#34;American Idol, The Voice...etc.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addicted to this game!!!  Love it have told all my friends that have a Kindle they can now play it on their Kindle and a couple are already hooked on it.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|This is a great DVD showing the band from early on through the present time and information on what was going on with band members and how they came to be together. Amazing how many other famous singers influenced the band.
B00E1LT41K|5.0|I give this first season 5 stars because it was well written the costumes were great<br />for this era the  Acting out standing. this series should win a award in all catagories<br />I am hooked on films from the 14th , 15th and 16th century. I watched the entire series on Stars, I have my pre-Order in and would like to know when it will be released<br />I hope I do not have to wait until Sept. or Oct. 2014 before it is released.For every one who likes this time in History you cannot go wrong with the White Queen.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Mind numbing play but wish the other characters were able to do actions. Fun so far . See what else it does
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I chose this over spending more money on a device just so I could watch Netflix. It's just enough for what I need. The interface via iPhone is easy-peasy, a little more of a pain if you don't use a smartphone. Easy set-up, and more sites eventually. Works for me!
B00G32OER4|4.0|I thought the movie was suspenseful, entertaining and spooky.<br /><br />I originally went to the theaters to to see this movie. I liked it enough to rent it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This  book kept me interested the whole time! I never wanted to put it down. I am still wondering what happens next! I love this author
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I never play games but this has me playing everyday just collecting and playing around in my little village and visiting friends:)
B001NZ3DY6|5.0|This is a wonderful cd with all great songs. Can't wait til she comes out with a new cd. Don't miss this one.
B000I9S668|3.0|Great movie, I have no complaints about that.  My complaint is that I'm hard of hearing and it was indicated that there was CC on this movie.  I buy the movie and the option for it is there, but there are no actual subtitles.  And I don't know how to fix this or complain to Amazon.
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|It is an enjoyable way to pass time. I had trouble with the puck reacting to my movements. It would be great for children
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Old farts don't do games very well enough said on this subject, and jumpy things don't help every much when we are slower than molasses in minus . 30 degree weather
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great story, inflames the imagination, as Stephen King does so well.  If you are a loyal reader, it's a must read!
B007KUFDBY|5.0|I bought this since it was a Disney move and it was pretty inexpensive.  I also liked the idea of introducing my daughters to science fiction though this movie.  This has become a surprise hit with them and is something that they request frequently by asking to watch &#34;Jim&#34;.  They also scream his name in the opening sequence when he's riding a hover skateboard.
B007KLKFSO|5.0|One of the most poignant and deft portrayals of the intoxicating power of first love. This novel is a great reason why we so -called 'grown-ups' read what's marketed as YA fiction: because it's so good at perfectly capturing the emotional chaos of back then.<br /><br />Added bonus, not taking a second seat, was the backdrop of poverty in the MidWest, how cruel and selfish family can be, and how deeply loving.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have to say first and foremost this is my first review and in saying that I have to say how completely disappointed I was with this book. It truly made me sad to have read and loved the first two books only to have waited months for the release of this book. Besides the fact that the characters and plot were everywhere, the ending was just horrible. We've gone through a lot of heartbreak with these characters only to have our hopes dashed of a happy ending for the two main characters. I don't think I'm going to see the movie when it comes out either, why invest yourself into something that is going to break your heart. No thanks.....
B006LR0XLM|5.0|There are some things an iPad can't do. So for those files I need to use only on my PC. It's so simple to just download them into Dropbox and immediately they are there on all my devices.
B000SUKPKM|5.0|This compilation covers all the bases as it includes all their big hits - and the Goo Goo Dolls had a lot. Every single song is a good one.
0307279189|5.0|I bought this book after listening to the advice of a friend. They told me that it was one of those books that was nearly impossible to put down and, wow, were they right. McDougall is a very good writer, who is incredibly easy to relate to, making the read even better. This isn't a book about boasting your marathon times or how many miles in a day someone can run, but a book of genuine storytelling. If you love running, or even if you believe you've lost that love for running, pick up this book.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|I got this mostly for Kravitz's big hits. Some of his lesser-known work is on here and I guess you have to be a real Kravitz fan to enjoy it. It's not terrible, but it's not stellar either.
B000GOWNPU|5.0|The movie starts with fairly standard mob stuff. You think you know what is going on. But the issues get more and more personal, emotional, complex. Then the final courtroom scenes. Wow. The acting is flawless. Almost no movie can honestly be called a \\"masterpiece,\\" but this one deserves that title.
B002OFWG7E|4.0|This is a very good compilation that covers all the bases and features the big hits. Some of the songs are decent, but nothing to write home about. I'd still recommend it.
0596522347|5.0|These books were recommended to me by someone who had a chance to attend a workshop with Nancy Duarte.<br /><br />The moment I got these books in my hand, I was swept away. Both the books are very simple to read and understand. Concepts are explained very well with detailed illustrations and numerous examples.<br /><br />Attention to detail is phenomenal in both the books and they have covered almost every aspect of making an impactful presentation.<br /><br />In this book the author has focused on contents and placements of the charts.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Robots cool and graphics are top notch. Didn't expect the game to be great for a free game. And upgrades are great for continued game play. Wish I had more money to play more than I do.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I absolutely love to play Mahjong (but hate how other companies try to change and update it to make it new and \\"cool\\"). This app isn't like that and is by far the best Mahjong game for the Kindle Fire. I have played for 3 days non-stop since I have downloaded it! I highly recommend this app! If you're a fan of Mahjong, download this app.....you'll love it!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is simply amazing. Life changer. After having done Landmark education's curriculm, I just enjoyed reading this book. Good.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|This movie was put together very well and I look forward to seeing more from this series as long as they don't over embelish the next ones.
B00004RMXF|3.0|I ordered this VHS, IN German and when It came it was the English version instead of the German like it's stated in the description. Either they sent the wrong language or the description is incorrect.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Purchased this CD for my dad as a gift, but wanted to give it a listen before gifting it.  I know, I'm horrible.  Anyway, I love the CD, despite not being a huge fan of bluegrass, and have decided to keep it.  I'm thinking now of buying another copy for dad.
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|philosophic in the sense that an effective case for WHY working remotely is the right idea, and ultimately inescapable.<br /><br />Some good ideas on how to implement.<br /><br />Not present: detailed &#34;how to&#34;.

B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters when it was very limited, I believe only one theater had it in my state at first. I got bigger and went to do well. I loved this movie just from watching the trailer, it has a great story and I think tells a better picture of what high school really was like. In the short time you come to care for the characters and can feel a connection even though you might not have gone through the same exact situation. I got the Blu-Ray version and it looks fabulous and got an iTunes plus an Ultraviolet copy as well which was a very nice bonus. I highly recommend this movie!
B005H9B2CE|2.0|Poor story, fair acting, but good action scenes.  If they make a sequel I won't bother viewing, even for free.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is really well put together, it does have some love components and they work really well. The music is very catchy and I always find myself singing the music at least once a week. I got the Blu-ray copy and it did come with an iTunes and Ultraviolet copy. I actually downloaded the movie on my phone once during a long car drive and had the movies playing through the speakers and it's just as fun because the music is well placed and diverse. Great purchase!!
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I was unable to finish this book. I hate to leave a book unfinished, but I felt like it was just too tortuous go continue reading this book. How did anyone agree to publish it?
B0046B6X1E|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid, and I just couldn't appreciate back then the incredible performances of Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. You'll feel for Carrie White in every scene she's in (you will fight back tears) and you'll taste the insanity and pain of Laurie's portrayal of the fanatical despotic mother from hell. nuff said..if you haven't seen it..do.<br /><br />To try and remake this movie is like trying to remake &#34;The Godfather&#34;
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I appreciate games that test your brain power, and this is definitely one of those.  It didn't take long to complete all the levels in the game, but it was well worth the time spent.
B000FA57US|5.0|I'm not sure what the hell that reviewer on the bottom of me is talking about.Tina was the only good thing about this entire film.It sucked that she didin't show us viewers any skin.After her death scene,I just turned this movie off.Such a shame a hot babe like that got murdered :(  damn you,Michael!!! RIP Tina
B00CRS88IO|4.0|It's been a long time since I read Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas, but that was the first book that came to mind when reading The Ian Fleming Files. Not so much the character but the writing. It it truly wonderful and void of any hype or fluff. It simply tells the story in a way that rivals Koontz in his telling of Odd Thomas's story. A must if you are a fan of Fleming and/or historical fiction.
0375842209|5.0|An amazing book! Enjoyed every single word. Such beautiful writing and a wonderf story really. *Not for the faint hearted!
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent read. Can't wait to read the next book in this series. If you like Shades of Gray, you'll like this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A great challenging game.  One of the better puzzle games.  I recommend for someone who likes to take objects apart. Have fun!
B007V5XT1O|4.0|I like the songs.  Good vocals.  Getting more than one hit on this CD.  First Carrie Underwood CD I have purchased.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author. I was really impressed. Incredible reality in sci-fi settings. He wove fascinating stories with multiple believable characters and tight plots with plenty of suspense. Character developments were top notch. Each story thread and their sequencing kept the pace fresh and thrilling. This collection was a consistent page turner.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of those games that is really hard to stop playing because it is so much fun. !!!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book Is extremely well written and get easy to get lost in. The characters seemed real as I read through. I would sit for a long period of time focused on nothing but this book. Immediately after beginning the novel, I never wanted to put it down.  I recommend this book to anyone who reads really.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Okay. So the reason why the ending was terrible was because it was heart wrenching!  It shows some great dedication and the book overall was fantastic!  I enjoyed reading Percy's side and I liked that he was more part of the book.  Don't like Jason or Piper because they are winy and it is made out to be the opposite of Annabeth and Percy.  Rick Riordan tried to hard with that pairing.  Still a great book though!  Percy would have won though.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I am a huge Forrest Gump fan and had to have this movie.  The day i bought it, it went on Netflix streaming.  So if you are a fan of having the DVD than get the 2-Disc edition because it has a lot of content the streaming movie does not.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game J's the best because you can go on th harder and harder and a lot more challenging for your Brian to think of more moves to make.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I couldn't put this down. Sometimes those of us in the sandwich generation forget there really is a key to connecting with today's youth and it took an elder to remind us of this. A great read and offered some historical information I was not aware of.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|So good, but such a tearjerker.....why?!?!?! I do on't want to spoil it...you just need to read it for yourself. Enjoy!
006202406X|3.0|I won't go into a lot of detail since so many others have already done that.  Just adding my voice to the mix.<br /><br />I don't normally read YA fiction (I'm a 50-ish mom), but these books really caught my imagination and wouldn't let go.  I couldn't wait for Allegiant to come out to find out what happens to Tris and Four.<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT:)<br /><br />Now that I've finished the book this morning, I have to agree with other reviewers.  Maybe once the ending isn't so fresh in my mind I'll see things differently, but I really dislike the turn of events in this book.  Once Tris was killed off, the momentum of the story really bogged down for me.  I understand why Ms. Roth would choose to use Tris' sacrifice to save her brother as a very effective means of twisting the story and keeping Tris true to her character, but to put it mildly, to actually do this sucks!  This was Tris' story--as much as I liked Four too--and to kill her off just doesn't set right with me.<br /><br />I also am disappointed in how much of a weakling Four seemed to turn into as well.  I understand the reasons for his self-doubt and sadness, but feel that it was overplayed a bit, lessening his likeability.  Screaming at the end on the zip line?  Come on.  He may have had some psychological trauma due to his parents' abuse and the loss of Tris, but to see such a strong character falter and change to that extent was disappointing. I like my \\"damaged\\" heroes to overcome their obstacles a bit more definitively than how Four seems to at the end.<br /><br />If Ms. Roth produces any future works, I'm sure I'll read them, but I'll try not to become too attached to the main character(s).  Who knows what she'll wind up doing to them.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Enjoy playing this game, Glad it's available on my kindle now!  Now they just need FV 2 on Kindle !
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Resistance...  I love it.  I now know what to call my arch nemesis.  Great book for the Creatives and anyone in their own Business.
B007XH6BPG|5.0|Very excellent progressive rock music that I haven't heard in awhile.Steve Hackett and Chris Squire at there best. Great Music
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I just recently read The Shining to refresh my memory of Danny Torrance and his family, and I'm very glad I did. This novel perfectly ties together middle aged Danny's demons with his ghosts from The Overlook. Every character is perfectly and masterfully executed and clear and concise in who they are. Abra is by far one of my favorite King characters, but every character, especially Danny, is fascinating. The ending is completely unexpected, and more intricate than I could've possibly imagined. Five Stars, no hesitation.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|This app should be in the hall of fame! It's just like Mario kart, only with more awesome  vehicles, and catchier music! 5 stars for SURE.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|This one volume was a great joy to read. I have read many books about the second world war in all of its theaters. For what Antony Beevor did in one volume is worth reading for anyone who wants to know anything about this war. He covers all the aspects, the Mediterranean, Italy, the war in the East, and in the Pacific theater. He does justice to all of them. I realize in one volume events in detail cannot be covered thoroughly but Beevor does justice to all the events. The thing that surprised me the most was how up to date the book was done in his up-to-date research. As lately, there has been much more resources available. This is due because the Kremlin has opened up after the Cold War and in America more resources are available because time is expired on many of the classified documents. This history tells the events without the intention of passing on any judgment. It does become apparent that there were many egotists and this war on all sides had leaders with their peculiarities. This would be an excellent book for anyone who wants to cover the entire war and get serious history about all the theaters and the struggles.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is so awesome so many choices on what to drive and where to drive, i love it! =]
B00AHRWBH6|5.0|This book here deserves to be read continuously!  This should not be a book to be read and then put back on the bookshelf to collect dust.  Anyone who is looking for the truth of how to improve life will find value in this book; it is not JUST for Christians, or Buddhas, or New Agers, or physicists, or scientists or whoever.  Practically EVERYONE can find their own particular truth in this book...if it is the truth that is sought.  There is work required, but not the work that we've been led to believe.  And, I learned that this type of work is actually harder which is why not everyone does it...or wants to.  This book is worth the read!
B00B7I8HZ4|5.0|This thing is perfect for my Home Theater PC. I added a hard drive and memory, installed the latest version of OpenELEC, and it works great! It's very small and doesn't make any noise. It could easily be mounted behind your TV and never be seen. I'm not sure why they don't include the power cable, though. It was easy enough to add one to my order, but it seems like a simple thing to omit. I don't think a lot of people have these types of power cords just laying around.

1476727651|5.0|Great read. I Couldnt put it down once I started. An excellent sequel to The Shining. I highly reccommend this book!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again, King takes ridiculous supernatural notions and spins a tale rich with characters and story lines you care about. You'll want to speed through this book to find out what happens!
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|Great movie and excellent animation! Kids and adults will love it. One of the best 3D films so far this year.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|helpful!! I spend so much time on my kindle that having this comes in so handy. I wish it could be locked.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've played my fair share of games on facebook.. from Bejeweled Blitz and Mafia Wars to Farmville and Train Station. But this game beats them all. I've never stuck with any game on facebook longer than Bingo Blitz!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Found myself getting annoyed at the beginning of the book as it seemed to be about walking and getting blisters. The book picked up when Harold begins to let other people in and to not be so self-involved. The ending was a total surprise and really well done.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I downloaded Canby Crush on my Kindle because my grandkids were playing it at their house.  This is their favorite game right now.  Good for young & old.  Very colorful.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|The book is better than the movie! I would recommend this rea for anyone who likes a journey of self discovery.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I found myself questioning the plot and motivations of the characters through out the entire book.  Not much seems well thought out in this novel.  None of the answers to WHY there are factions or WHAT happened outside the city make any sense.  There are so many holes in the explanations they hence to be believable.<br /><br />It was very disappointing considering I liked the first 2 books.  After reading Allegiant it makes me question whether I should have read the series in the first place.
B002X3Y9FO|4.0|I bought this movie because i enjoy foreign films. I also am a big fan of Max Von Sydow, even though he had a minimal role.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Thanks for finally giving us a fun and popular game on Kindle.  Works well and loads of fun.  Keep up the good work.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|This DVD was great!  It had extra features that were not shown on HBO.  The DVD was delivered sooner than I expected which is always a pleasant.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Just saw Love in Vegas and was blown away.  So I had to bring the music home with me!  The way George Martin and his son sliced and diced the classic Beatles songs is haunting and amazing!  Can't wait to get back to Vegas to see it in person again!  This CD is a permanent fixture in my car!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Early levels are fun, but quickly reach levels designed to be near-impossible without spending money on power-ups (via IAP).  Uninstalled.

B000ASDFJU|5.0|I love sex and the city but I had to sell it for quick cash. I will buy the new collection set.
B0063IH60K|3.0|great program if you just want to play traditional solitaire and not branch out to play different types of solitaire
0345803450|3.0|A decent read, but as others have commented, a bit unsatisfying.  Easy to read and well-written, but the story wasn't all that captivating.  The end was a surprising twist, but slightly unbelievable.  Glad I checked it out from the library, rather than having bought it.  Not one for your classics on your bookshelf.  Entertaining at times, though.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|enables you to search in a more intense direction which gives the ability to find more details about what you are searching for
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Hannibal is as brutal as the character itself. The show is pulls no punches when it comes to the grizzly murders perpetrated by both Hannibal and the selection of serial killers paraded through the series. A show better fit for HBO but here it is on NBC and at least one station refused to carry it.<br /><br />Hugh Dancy, Mads Mikkelsen, and Laurence Fishburne all turn in amazing performances. Mads delivers his lines as the sociopathic Hannibal in the way the few can; no emotion, no passion, just resolve. We know who and what Hannibal is and we root for the people who are pre-ordained to find him and catch him. Where there would be the urge to play Hannibal as a person to empathize with, Mads plays him as the soulless character he is.<br /><br />I feel compelled to compare this show to Criminal Minds, where Criminal Minds wants us to feel for the FBI, Hannibal does not. We have seen Hugh Dancy take Will Graham to brink of insanity thanks to Hannibal. I can't wait to see how Laurence Fishburne and the other characters drag him back in season two.<br /><br />This show is for people who like stunning visuals and great characters but can also tolerate seeing the worst of humanity played out among the well dressed and their bloody victims.
B00FRMDH7Y|5.0|I know that this movie didn't do so well in the box office but truly this movie was a great movie to watch with the whole family it was witty and charming. It truly is a movie that will be enjoyed by every member of your family.
B00BW0QC8G|5.0|I got this bag 3 months back for my university classes use. Its great in use, durability, material etc.. Storage space is awesome. IPAD, Laptop, chargers, phone, water bottle, notebooks, pen holder. Diary pouch. Productivity and usability is great. You should surely go for it.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|This album is amazing, I thoroughly enjoy all of the songs on this, and I am expecting big things from Avicii in the future. Wasn't sure about the country/EDM cross at first, but it totally works perfectly! Very satisfied.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Quite honestly, I don't even think about using a different search engine. I always find what I need here, quickly and with not a lot of goose chasing.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|This was cute - but too much on the serious side. The first 2 were hilarious! This was ok, but not as funny as the first 2. Now the very very ending where the dude comes out with breasts - that was hilarious!! Best part of the whole movie! I just hope it doesn't mean they have another movie on the way - they kind of lost their way on this one with the funny parts.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I should have never downloaded it, i can't stop playing :-) It is a simple, fun game that is also challenging.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Enjoyed it and liked the special effects. However, I don't know why Jeff B. has to talk like he has a mouthfull of marbles. He was hard to understand at times.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I didn't see Pacific Rim in the theaters because the previews made the movie look a little cheesey.  I ended up renting it through Amazon Instant and it turned out to be a surprisingly awesome movie.<br /><br />Pacific Rim is a fun movie with an action packed story and a plethora of amazing actors.
B00F2HW20M|4.0|It is difficult to resist hearing a band that plays a tribute to one of your favorite bands, like Genesis, especially when it's their best music in the 70's. We have here only songs of the period were Hackett was in the band, including the beautiful &#34;Shadow of the Hierophant&#34;, who was co-written with Mike Rutherford during the rehearsal of the Foxtrott sessions. Hackett was accompanied by some guests musicians a part from his band. Nad Sylvan sings the majority of the songs, some maybe will be disturb by his mannerism, trying to match Gabriel's voice, but Hackett wanted someone flamboyant, he surely got it. But we can make this criticism to all the singers involved because you can't replace Peter Gabriel voice.<br /><br />The interpretation of the songs is faithful to the originals, with some revisited and corrected solos, but also with the addition of the saxophone of Rob Townsend, when we can hear him clearly. One thing disturbed me during this concert; the drum sound of Gary O'Toole. The drums were sounding too heavy and noisy, a bit like the guy had cheap drums. I don't know if it would have made a difference if the sound engineer had put his sound down. More impressive is Lee Pomeroy who is a left handed bassist and guitar player that plays on right handed instruments! The keyboards of Roger King recreate with fidelity the sound of those whom we have been used to hear with Tony Banks in the 70's. Steve Hackett is obviously the musician that still characterized with the more accuracy the Genesis sound, because he was in the band with some of the same instruments.<br /><br />The picture quality is excellent and the 5.1 surround sound is full, not only for ambiance. The visuals are impressive with a nice light show and projections on LD screens. While I had a good time listening to my favorite music of the 70's, you can't stop thinking in this kind of project at the idea that it's only a recreation of music that is owned by other artists. The project of Nick D'Virgilio with « The Lamb Lies down on Broadway » was more satisfying, because he was bringing a little bit more in the music with more new arrangements and instruments. Still, plenty of Genesis fans will want to take a look at this concert, because it's a chance to see our favorite old music with the new technology.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I did sort of see this coming after about ten minutes, but that did not make it any less well done, or any creepier. I will not spoil it but I will say that not since the Ring or the Grudge has a movie stayed with me this much.

006202406X|3.0|The first book of this series was absolutely riveting. From there the series went steadily downhill.<br />For me the series was always about the young men and women who were forced to grow up before their time and the fact that they were still able to show such bravery and selflessness. I was disappointed to find that Roth had strayed from her usual themes of bravery  selflessness in the face of danger, and instead gave us a rather monotonous love story about troubled teenagers, with the occasional action scene. The only thing that even partially salvaged this for me was the ending. Many people hated the ending (and for good reason), but I liked it because it's exactly what Tris would do. It was an act that only someone who is both abnegation and dauntless could do. It was something you could do only do if you were completely brave and completely selfless, because sometimes they're the samething.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|This is quite surreal at time with things floating about, it takes a bit of getting used to but it then it's fine Thank you

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was ridiculous!!! It haunted me for months- I almost bought it multiple times and finally a student started reading it so I did too. Damn, I cannot unread this beautifully haunting, funny, tragic story that runs on in the end. But I didn't mind. I really loved the characters so much. A new favorite. Still it broke my heart for every kid with cancer who won't get more time- viciously honest. Exactly how my students like it.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Watched the performance on PBS and loved it. Had to have the sound track. Joe's musical range is awesome. Love It.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only thing I don't like about this game is when you get to a certain level it makes you send friend requests or buy the next level. Other than that it is addicting.
B004G606K8|5.0|Dragon of Autumn Twilight is the first book in the trilogy ( Dragonlance Chronicles).  I love this trilogy.  Must Read!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|really good game nice picks, easy to understand. kids from 8 up can pretty much play. but the one draw back is the jumping aruond in the chapters and different. part ot the story that is when it gets harder for the younger groups.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is good but I suggest it for an older crowd. I am absolutely in love with this book
B00E8G5H6Y|1.0|Ok so I had to update all of my blu ray players just to get the disc to work. It still won't work on my Sony blu ray player. No idea why. I don't want to spend fifty dollars on it at a store to try a different one when I waited over a week for it to arrive after I preordered it a month early. This is not how I saw my bday gift to my husband going. Thanks for making it a lame gift. So upset!

Best ever versions of Comfortably Numb by far, and Sorrow, by far,  The great gig in the sky is better on Delicate Sound of Thunder, but only a little, and some would disagree with me on that.  No one will ever be a better guitar player and no one will ever be more creative than Pink Floyd!!<br /><br />Shipping fast and awesomely free under super saver

B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I can't believe I ignored Plex for so long while I spent hours and hours trying to get my networked media to stream to all of my TVs and devices.  Once I got the Plex server running and got the apps for my various devices (GoogleTV, iPad, Kindle, etc) everything JUST WORKED.  I do wish they offered some way to secure specific content...  But otherwise it's a perfect solution for those of us who still prefer to have our media on our own network!
1452110581|5.0|If the hilarious title isn't enough to tempt you into buying this, know that the contents are worth it. Accompanied by the appropriate cat pictures, I Could Pee on This: And Other Poems by Cats) contains poetic wisdom penned by our furry friends. To be honest, I expected it to be one of those books that you buy just for the lark of having a book with such a title, but never read because the poems are not as funny as the front implies. However, it serves as more than just a small, adorable coffee table decoration with its witty rhymes and tales that cat-owners and cat-lovers can easily relate to.
1118109791|3.0|This is a fine book to get if you just want review questions. That's basically all it is. If you get this book, I wouldn't bother with the extra official GMAT review guides for quant & verbal. Or get the the review guides and don't bother with this one. Working lots of review questions is vital to success on the GMAT so you can learn to think like the testmakers. But, most people will probably also need a book to teach them some techniques for mastering the GMAT. For that, go to Kaplan, Princeton or Peterson, depending on your learning style (I found Kaplan most useful to me). I got this because I was hoping for some substantal tips from the testmakers. That is not the purpose of this book. It's fine, but probably won't fulfill all your needs.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book. It was very touching. And had a wonderful plot. Not just all about the bedroom. It is definitely one of my favorites!
0470449764|4.0|I found this review book to be helpful in drilling your ability to handle the quatitative questions on the GMAT. It also highlights which area you really need to focus on. Bottom line, you have to know this level of math cold before you can start doing some of the more advanced logical reasoning that the GMAT is supposed to be testing in this section. My biggest complaint with this book was the answer explanation section. Other study guides (like Kaplan) will give you detailed explanations as to why you missed a question, usually complete with the math. It helps to understand the complete logic behind an answer. This guide just gives you a very basic overview of why the answer is what it is. But it is imperative that you do lots and lots of review questions to get ready for the test, so this is good.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I find myself playing this a lot, it's a great game to pass the time with. Definitely worth five stars.
0470449756|4.0|This book was very helpful in reviewing the different types of critical reasoning and sentence construction that the GMAT testmakers use. These are both more formal than we use in daily life, so it takes some adjustment to get your brain to think in that manner. However, there is a repetitive nature to the types of questions that are asked that lends itself to familiarity if you do enough review problems. You begin to recognize how the testmakers like to phrase things which makes it easier to choose the correct answer even if you are not 100% sure. This book is all review questions, so don't look for many helpful hints. But it is very useful since doing lots of review questions is essential for success on the GMAT.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|this is a Wonderful book¡ could had a better en dying because I want ed to see hazel s 'response to Augustus s letter
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|Although the game itself seemed tantalizing enough, after the first section it wouldn't stay loaded. It kept blanking to a black screen and then re-downloading. I never got to finish the game! I can't recommend something that doesn't work properly when all my other games function just fine.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I like the conversation starters presented in the book, yes they are pretty basis but somehow you need to admit that we are lazy to apply these techniques in some situations.  And I need this book as a reminder :) dealing with people is a form of art.
B0027MJU00|4.0|The book kept my interest in wanting to finish the book, it kept me guessing.<br />It was very disturbing to read in some parts so I had to skip over that.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm so happy they finally got it on kindle I'm so addicted to this game... I gave 4 stars because I'm frustrated that I used to play it on my ipod and since I updated it, now I cant connect to facebook anymore so I'm back to level 1 when I was in level 325!!! they need to fix that! other than that now I'm glad I can play it on my kindle! &quot;sweet&quot; &quot;sugar crush&quot;!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I don't like early mornings or alarm clocks, but this app works well for me. The fade in is great!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Somewhat of a &#34;chic-flick&#34; but very enjoyable.  &#34;Everything will be perfect in the end -- and if it's NOT perfect, then it's not the end.&#34;
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Alma has inherited her father's interest in plants and a passion for them.  In the mid nineteenth century her intelligence and interests set her apart from other females.  Only her parents prize her knowledge and her inquisitiveness.  When an adopted sister joins the family, she finds she can not relate to the new child.  Consequently, she becomes more and more enmeshed in her study of plants, especially mosses.  She finds a limited kind of happiness which is turned on its head when a fellow scientist (male) enters the picture.  Her attachment to Ambrose leads her to take a chance which results in adventures all over the world and a fulfillment undreamed of in her time.<br />The reader will enjoy learning of Alma's life and times as well as learn a great deal about botany.
B0081BU42O|1.0|The title refers to a musical piece so difficult it required the invention of a new instrument to play; and, moreover, the instrument could only be played properly by a creature with four arms. Surprisingly, when all these elements come together, the result could only be termed a modestly annoying experience. Well, Banks has apparently created this experience for us in literary form.    Look, I know this is a kind of cult classic. I know  I it's supposed to be funny. But... The book is full of mind-jangling effects, making it really difficult to read. It's full of acronyms, it jumps from place to place and time period to time period with no apparent order and engages in no serious character development. The names of characters amazingly damage the readability. For example, one is named QiRia. When you see it, you try to force it into some sound combination you're familiar with and you can literally hear your neurons hissing while they try to do this! The \\"heroine's\\" name keeps popping up in your consciousness as \\"Croissant\\" and you keep correcting yourself to get it right - a real detraction from the text.    Similar \\"inventions\\" appear throughout. While the heroine is \\"humanoid\\" you slowly find that she is barrel-chested and has no breasts. And, of course, she has four arms. We also learn that while other species of \\"humanoids\\" may become momentarily attractive, as more clothes come off, a sense of nausea sets in... GACK! Other such devices appear: a man with 53 penises grown over his whole body; gaining access to a floating craft by swimming through its septic system... This is all to gross to be funny.    The basic premise of the book - the uncovering of a startling revelation pertaining to a cultures religious belief - is of miniscule import to the creatures of the novel. Even the main characters say (and I quote) \\"what the _____\\" when they hear about it.    So in the end, you've wadded through over 550 pages of what can only be described as a mildly irritatingbook. I guess this is an exercise in how not to write a novel.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show and I bought a pair of HDMI cables hooked my Kindle fire hd to my 40in TV to watch it great picture!!!!!!!!!!
B008JFUO72|1.0|What an awful movie.  The plot is set into action because Tony Stark is having trouble sleeping, and a fake terrorist threatens the land (in such a hokey performance that no one has the ability to see  through).  The real bad guys are a group that has burning bodies -- never figured out where that came from.  In the big final action set piece, Iron Man's suit keeps coming on and off without any clear reason -- what's the good of being Ironman if you can't use the suit?  And finally, Stark's wife falls into an intense fire, presumably dying, but reappears without a scratch a few minutes later.  Huh?<br /><br />  One interesting thing: I was really surpried to see that the final credits lasted slightly over ten minutes.  There appeared to be something like 500 people involved in the making of this movie.  What a waste of talent.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very Happy now that Amazom  got the app for Candy Crush Saga game I have been waiting a long time to play this game on my Kindle Fire HD . This is a great game once you start playing it is very hard to stop playing love love love it!!!!!!!
B00ADQPB50|5.0|What a potpourri of horror genres. Torture, Nazi experimentation, misdirected scientific experimentation, Satanism, evil both human and non-human, mental issue killers, angels of death, exorcism of the possessed, mutilation, mass murder - did I miss any? If anything it's a bit overindulgent. What does this (and similar) film tell us about us humans? Oh well!
B000I186FW|5.0|Pros: Action packed, Thought provoking<br />Cons: Tackles mature themes (torture)<br /><br />It is a great time of year to watch this movie. The opening scene flashes back to November 5, 1604 to introduce Guy Fawkes and his plot to blow up Parliament. This event lays the foundation for the rest of the film. The Wachowski brothers take us to futuristic Great Britian under a totalitarian government. They masterfully weave a tale of rebellion focusing on two protagonists- V (Hugo Weaving), and Evey (Natalie Portman). This film does a really good job of developing the characters and moving the plot forward at the same time. The dialogue is incredible - V has some of the wittiest and thought provoking lines/speeches I have heard in any movie. This film is great for people who enjoy movies that make you think. The themes it focuses on include - freedom fighter v. terrorist, rebellion, and fear and freedom.<br /><br />With that being said this movie is not for everyone. It is violent and there are some scenes in a prison/torture that make some people uncomfortable. My wife doesn't really enjoy watching it. This movie is fairly intense so be sure you are up for that before you start it.<br /><br />I enjoy this movie so much and I try to watch it every year around November the 5th. I always come away impressed with the quality of the story, the acting, and the effects. While watching this movie you will realize that V stands for an idea and the idea will be very clear by the final scene. I love the ideas presented in this movie - that is why I watch it again and again.
B009ZM7D9K|5.0|Powerful film.  Avoided the trap of casting the &#34;oppressors&#34; as evil people...Kenneth B. played the role as someone that truly believes that he was doing what was best for the native people.  Of course, hindsight is easy, but in most cases, people that do things that we now see as wrong are typically doing what they honestly think that they are doing the right thing at the time.  Powerful acting by very young actors.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I know you will love it it is a awesome game my sister's love it that are 11 and 9 that love it I love it you should get this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids really love this game!  I have to admit I like playing it just as much as they do!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Great action movie, particularly for those of us that grew up with B grade monster flicks like Godzilla or Mothra.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|As of this review I'm on level 31. I hope earning boosts becomes an easy option soon for the Kindle Fire version though as my toddler likes grabbing it to \\"help\\".
B00D2I8E46|3.0|I was expecting a lot, I guess, after reading the review in Rolling Stone... Although EC has always been a bit whiny, he hit new lows in this front on this release.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The author needs to get a job.  I read this for a book club of 12 women and we all, except one, thought it a complete waste of our time. The story is gruesome, sick, and pitiful.  I am sorry I wasted precious time when there are other books to be enjoyed
B00C0QOZP8|4.0|I heard a bunch of their songs and I really liked Part 1.  Part 2 just does not do it fully for me but it is still a very good cd none the less.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It is the best game I love it. You will want it get it  and buy the full one because when you start you don't want to stop
B00C32R64G|5.0|I liked their last album and was curious to see how this album was.  I heard their songs being played on SiriusXM Satellite Radio and decided to listen to some samples and then eventually pick up the CD.
B002JTHFUS|4.0|My favorite U2 record so I had really high expectations. Packaging was superb. The album sounds better than ever. Disk 2 is filled with gems. The only flaw is that I wish they would have blessed us with TUF era show.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Very good album I cannot wait until part 2!  This is one of the other bands that I have consistently bought CDs for because they have not disappointed me yet.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|just downloaded the game, been playing non-stop.  now I just have to catch up with everyone else who<br />already has the game, lol. definitely recommend this to all gamers out there.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Game of Thrones is the best shows on TV today.  The actors and writers do a good job, I just wish they would get on with the war already.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a remarkable tale and told in such a haunting way.  I will tell all my friends that it is a must read.  Wow.  Hope that he keeps writing.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|I have been waiting a while for this album and man it is awesome!  This album is a mix of all the greatest rock bands in history.  GnR, Metallica, and Pantera.  Great riffs and great overall album!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|downloaded it and it wont play. keeps saying it closed unexpectedly. please fix this. will give more stars when I can actually play it
B009LDCZDC|5.0|I watched the first and second seasons and had to buy both of the seasons on Bluray.  Great new show, reminds me of 24.  Highly recommended if you watched 24.
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|Matthew McConaughy plays as good of a part as he could but the whole story was lame. I do not recommend this one! Sorry Matt. Matthew is normally a great actor but just picked the wrong part this time
B00CATSONE|5.0|Tesla's telling of his childhood and the insights he took from it are fascinating. Tesla accurately sees himself as different, but not in a boastful way. The language is charming with the use of obsolete words that I had fun looking up. This book reaffirms my belief that Tesla is the greatest inventor of all time.
B00EUM4ZQE|4.0|Most of the songs are really good with a good vibe or flow to them, Saturday night, trouble and problem are probably the best.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicted to candy crush of and loving it. But I am not paying for any thing, boosters, lives or tickets.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|n<br />This game is not impossibly hard but it does make you think.  So far it runs well with no bugs. I really like it. I hope they develop many levels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thankful now on Kindle!  I enjoy this game! I have envied others who could play on phones and other tablets!
B00E8B1358|3.0|It was ok but nothing I would have been happy to of spent money going to the theater for. Popcorn.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is amazing, and there is a good mixture of different sounds and tempos so it's not monotonous.  It has all of my favorite songs as well.  Love it!
B008GWOVB8|5.0|Went to Aunt's house and wanted to show the benefits of Amazon prime.<br /><br />Brought up my account and started watching Grease.<br /><br />She was blown away by the ease and by the quality. Movie still looks great.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Perfect. Finished it in a day I couldn't put it down computer host and true of anyone going through high school as a wallflower
B0036G1T78|5.0|Great acting never goes out of style.<br />Yes, it is quite dated (land lines? Who uses home phones anymore?), but still a great movie.<br /><br />And the fact that it is &#34;free&#34; on Amazon with your Amazon Prime is just incredible.<br /><br />Looked great in HD over TV as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thought this game was addictive wheN i WENT ON fACEBOOK BUT NOW THAT i HAVE IT ON MY KINDLE I IS EVEN MORE SO.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|cannot cast local media files and cannot cast in other apps, if it can connect to router with ethernet it will be much better
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|High addictive, many,many levels, continually being updated,, fun for<br />the whole family.<br /><br />No need to worry if one child or the whole family can play.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|Action was good and it was very funny but did not stay remotely true to comics which I didn't like
B00425S1H8|5.0|This was recognized when plugged in without installing additional drivers.  Works great for accessing my Cisco equipment.  The quality of the cable is also very nice solid.
B0076HNMU0|3.0|I like the music at the beginning and the end.  It is a haunting piece of music.  The show is very &#34;campy&#34; and you need to watch it with that in mind!
B00005AR3G|5.0|I was laughing before I got this DVD unwrapped, it's sooo funny; so when I realized I had to buy a copy I found it on Amazon (used-egad!) held my breath, crossed my finger, pinched my eyes shut and hoped for the best?!!?? I worried needlessly, it got here a day early, cost less than I thought and remember (used-egad?!?), NO egad! It was totally all there, no scratches and even had the insert! I'm a believer! I'll come back, I'm already browsing. And thanks for the good deal, stellar service and the care in handling the 'fragile'!
0307887448|4.0|So, for whatever it is worth, I had an absolute blast reading this book. The references, while admittedly sometimes a little over the top, were a lot of fun and I think were interesting in several ways, but one more particular than others. The idea that this future version of our society had latched upon another era, almost to the point where the lines between the two are blurred, is really cool.<br /><br />As far as the technical aspects go, it was sometimes difficult to ascertain exactly what is a deficiency in Cline's writing and a perfect matching of an angsty, crushing, tech savvy teenager full of bravado. On the one hand there are times where the prose breaks down a little and it seems apparent that Cline had difficulty with particular sections. Other times I feel like he hit it so dead on that it's tough to tell if he messed up or the writing is perfect. On the whole I think that Cline hits the mark far more than misses, so I tend to lean towards the latter.<br /><br />The only real issue I had with the book was the last two pages. I don't want to give anything, but if you read the book you'll more or less see it coming. My issue is that he worked so hard to write the whole story and then when it comes down to the ending we are all waiting for, it leaves a little to be desired. Perhaps that's Cline's inexperience showing, particularly with that type of scene. Or, perhaps, maybe this is another case where his writing is actually spot on and completely indicative of the social state of the characters outside of the OASIS. Either way, the book is tremendous fun to read and I would recommend it to anyone, and particularly to anyone who has experience with a lot if the subject matter the book is concerned with.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Only my second hunting game on the fire and so far no noticeable glitches which is great.  Was able to duck hunt with the los t ok so I plan on deleting and reloading after I be a t it to see how far one c a n get with th h just handguns.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like that it could be for any age. It's a fun game for all. I also liked that they updated a fun Halloween one.

B00G32OER4|5.0|It was a good scary movie. Probably because it was based upon a true story.great special effects were done to it.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|Best movie about the intoxicating allure of being the fastest. Truly from a drivers perspective. The implied emotions are spot on perfect!
B009JEK652|5.0|Love the music and the style.  Brings back fond memories of Kraftwerk (One of my favorite groups).  Will be purchasing more of NEU!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|No ads.  Great picture.  Love the story and the characters.  Also, my wife and I enjoy it together, unlike Saturday and Sunday football; or Tuesday night show lineup.
B00FPH51LQ|1.0|Ghost Busters meets Men in Black.  I kept waiting for the movie to start but only got Special Effects animation.  Finally gave up after half an hour.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.  Go have a tooth pulled instead.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I see this is one of those movies that most people will probably either love or hate.  I love the \\"I Shouldn't Be Alive\\" show, and that is why I gave this movie a try.  As it turns out, I loved this movie.  Other people have described it, so I won't do into that.  I thought the pacing was well done with the flashbacks occurring at appropriate times to add to the emotions the characters went through.  I also thought the acting was excellent.  The plot was even better.  I loved the way the boy went from being scared and insecure to finding courage and strength.
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|Plays what I need it to without bells and whistles. Good, solid app. Allows me to play home videos and downloaded video outside of Amazon licensed video.
0446579939|4.0|I read this book a couple of years back and then read it again just a few months ago. The characters of the book really spoke to me and it was not at all predictable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of how the book ended!
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Face it, there will never be another \\"Ten,\\" but they've continued to evolve and this is as close as they've come to their phenomenal debut. Ya gotta listen more than once to get it!  Great Album!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I purchased the Chromecast expecting to be able to cast anything for my iPad to my TV. First it doesn't work with first generation iPad. Second. It really only casts utube, netflix, and a couple of google apps. Next it worked ok for netflix with my iPhone at first then died after about two weeks. I first contacted google for tech support. That was the worst experience I have had with tech support ever. Unbelievable lack of customer support and incredible hassle trying to get a replacement. So I finally gave up and contacted Amazon.  Amazon took care of the issue straight away with no hassle and no delay. l give Chromecast a grade of C for functionality, Google an F for tech support and Amazon an A+ for customer service.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|good quality no gliches...DVD brand new, am looking forward to the final series..have my order in for DVD on release date
B00CPWTRAA|5.0|Domingo is legend. Nothing else needs to be said and it's wonderful that he is taking up now the baritone repertoire. Gracias, Domingo.
B00DBQ0AV4|5.0|I am a big Netrebko fan. I find her voice one of the most beautiful sounds in opera. I love the sensuality, warmth and passion her voice embodies. The Verdi repertory fits perfectly with the bigger she has developed. Netrebko is here all for you, body and soul.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So so so happy this is finally back on Amazon! Runs great, no glitches. More levels too! I was going through candy crush withdrawal. Gotta go beat level 350 now. Happy crushing!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I despised all the requests I was receiving on FB about this game so much that I vowed to never play. One day I downloaded it just to see what all the hype was about and I LOVE IT! Same exact thing happened with my fiance. Now we play together!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Love it!  Kids and I replayed this all summer long.  How many ways can you think of killing a Zombie?
B004SBX112|4.0|You need more birds on the harder levels, not just three. Over all the game is just great. I would recommend it to a friend.
0545128285|2.0|Unless you're a diehard Potter fan, this book's not going to hold much for you. I was hoping there would be more in depth stories and tie-in's to the Potter series but I lost interest not even halfway through the book.
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|The Case is awesome and matches so well with my new iPhone. It's considerate to have protectors for the case itself before somebody uses it! It is really splendid!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This book will make you think about how technology that makes things easier and safer has the potential to get us to a scary place...
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I liked this book it was very interesting filled with unexpected memories and stories. I liked the giver he was a good friend to Jonas
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Sad and uplifting at the same time. The story flowed and was a page turner. A must read for young and old adults.
1250038820|5.0|Brandon always ask the great question, the one you would have asked if you were as perceptive as he is.
B00GBQI0M2|5.0|This short story by Scarlette D'Noire left me wanting more.  Just when you think you are reading another normal vampire tale, you get a suprise plot twist.......sexy, creative, and surprising!  I want to know more......especially Marea's background.  Keep it up Scarlette!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I honestly had difficulty putting this down.  It captured my interest from the prologue of the first book, and has kept my attention through the next three.  Looking forward to starting the next book.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|This game is amazing!!!! Playing with chatting with friends is fun. The different game modes make it a challenge, along with some minigames to play if your bored. The only problem I have with this is it crashes ALOT. Defiantly needs a patch. Other than that, it's so fun. Download it now
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|I'm generally a fantasy reader, but I've been searching for more Sci Fi based books lately, just to mix it up--Ender's Game, Old Man's War, The Lost Fleet Series.  I'm glad I ran across Ancillary Justice.  I don't want to reveal the plot, just say that I couldn't put it down.  It's confusing at times due to the multiple perspectives (you'll understand as you read), but you get used to and start to enjoy the shifts--it's what makes the book so fascinating.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I found the videos on youtube a while ago and then saw they were playing locally.  One of the best concerts I have ever been too.  Funny and great music, the show was sold out and everyone left with a smile on their face and humming a tune.  I enjoy the CD and so do my collage children.  Check out their youtube where they play in a senior center, these guys are great and nothing objectionable for anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|didn't think I would enjoy this game but I was wrong!  I like how they vary the games at each stop.  I'm hooked!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Fun and entertaining, what more do you need! The music is great and refreshing with no objectionable issues which is rare these days, they even use the word family and Christmas.
B0047E9TRA|5.0|Remakes rarely as good as original.<br />Especially true here.<br />Hard to further develop the theme of this one.<br />Forget the others.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for it to come to kindle fire. So glad I don't have to play on my phone anymore!
B0058P7KUA|3.0|Wanted this game for a while, so I waited till it was the faotd.. Glad I did, too.... The story is 100% pure cheese. Very lame story, and would let anyone under the age of 17 play it.... Exquisite lines such as &quot; I can't wait to shot them in face&quot; and such...<br />The gameplay is pretty decent, controls nice, and is action packed.... So if you can stand the lame dialog, is a good shooter.... And my only other complaint is on a paid app, why are there adds for other half brick games, and I mean full page , take you away from the game adds.... So deducting 2 stars for the insult, of the adds on a paid app...... By the way, fruit ninja paid does not do that so why should this one do so, I ain't sayin' , just sayin' ..........ML
0143124838|1.0|The book is so boring and unoriginal. Looks like it has been written overnight without a thought-through content. The drawings and photographs are also dull and pervert, you can find them on her Instagram without paying $22.00. Seriously - not worth it.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|My daughter got me hooked on this series so I had to buy this season to catch up to speed for season 9. This was a great buy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting. I play it all the time. Even if I get frustrated I always come back for more.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I could purchase this hear for the awesome price and have a solid cd, or I could purchase from itunes and pay MORE than on here, and only be able to download the songs.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|This book had the perfect amount of romance, drama, music and sorrow. You should get this book. Hence the words :#AMAZING!!!!!!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I am a prolific reader, primarily of fantasy and sci-fi. I didn't really know what bad writing was until I decided to check out a bunch of the \\"free\\" kindle books. Now I appreciate my old, re-read standbys even more!<br /><br />The bad grammar didn't bother me as much as it did many of the other reviewers. What DID bother me was the horrible, flat, whiny main character. It's an age-old device to have a main character that is the underdog that we are rooting for . . . in Thorgrin's case, however, he doesn't seem to have any RIGHT to us rooting for him. Is he horribly put-upon? No, not really, and yet, he acts like he is, and then bitches about how unfair everything constantly is. All while having everything that he ever dreamed of and more literally fall into his lap. Why would ANYONE like this kid? He's a whiny brat who gets all the luck.<br /><br />The author needs a better grasp of how to properly do exposition, as well. He drops too many chunks that the characters would NOT be thinking about in the blurb-like manner which they do.<br /><br />I could have put it down early on, but I didn't. And honestly, it does get a bit better once the author no longer has to cope with the fact that he is horrible at exposition.<br /><br />I am giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 star because there is actually a halfway decent idea behind the world setup. And I paid $0.00 for it, so I'm not AS pissed off as some of the other reviewers about being suckered by what was CLEARLY a \\"friends and family\\" campaign to boost the book rating. You CAN NOT compare this book to other fantasy greats, such as Game of Thrones or Harry Potter. The reviewers who think it is even in the same ballpark are clearly full of it. It would be a commendable effort for a first book, but one that shows that the author needs more training from someone more experienced, as well as a good editor.<br /><br />You get what you pay for: I paid zero and got zero. Ah well, it was better than re-reading the back of the cereal box (anyone who is a voracious reader know that there is a point that you will read just about anything you can get your hands on, and this certainly fits that need.)the cereal box (anyone who is a voracious reader know that there is a point that you will read just about anything you can get your hands on, and this certainly fits that need.)
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|great story, though a little dark, really good acting. i love that it's a series and i can get more involved. jennifer lawrence is a wonderful, lovely actress who has a great career ahead of her.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have only started reading Stephen King in the last 4-5 years and have read quite a few of his works. Doctor Sleep is among one of the best. Highly recommend it.
B00EP0SIOG|5.0|I had actually looked at picking up the original Sphero back when the various sites had it on sale, so when this popped up on Amazon, I knew I wanted to give it ago.<br /><br />At first, I thought it would be a fun toy to mess with my dogs (a Shiba and a Malamute), but honestly they don't care about it. My Malamute just moves out of the way and hides in her kennel, my Shiba looks down from the stairs disdainfully at it. If he's on the ground floor and I \\"bump\\" him with it, he just gives me this \\"Really?  We're doing this?\\" look and moves away.<br /><br />So while my dogs were not amused with it, I certainly was. The default app that you download is a simple \\"learn how to use Sphero\\" sort of app. You play around with the ball and you \\"level up,\\" unlocking different effects and speed boosts and the like. The only other app I've played with is the augmented reality app where you roll over the zombies. One thing about the game (and the sphere in general) is that you need a bit of room to really let this thing go.<br /><br />I play with the Sphero on a hard tile floor and it gets going pretty fast. Turns aren't razor sharp (there's lots of skidding on the hard surface) but it is quite maneuverable. However to get up to speed and do turns and squash zombies, you'd probably need at least a good 15' x 15' space. I don't really have such an area in my house, so it's constantly running into or under furniture. It's not that it won't work in a more confined space, it's just that you'll have a lot of stop-go-stop-go type play.<br /><br />Durability wise, I've already dropped the Sphero a couple of times onto the tile floor - so far, zero issue. I didn't drop it very far, maybe a foot or so. I've also slammed it into furniture at its top speed - it simply makes a mad \\"grunt\\" noise and keeps going.<br /><br />I'm playing with the Sphero on an Android based Samsung Note 3 - no lag or resource issues seen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! it is a game so intriguing...I like  playing  and comparing scores  This game is very addicting.
B004BCNVOA|5.0|I am a new fan of Pink. I thought it was a good idea to get the greatest hits. Wow- it is all just great!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|great sci-fi show!<br />The setting is good.<br />character development is compelling.<br />acting is believable.<br />worth watching television.<br />waiting for more episodes.
B007LE2VDM|4.0|Beautiful music and lyrics. I enjoy the intense emotional quality of the album. I just wish the album was longer.
B000PATZQK|5.0|This album (CD) is simply one of  the best original music I have ever heard!  It belongs right up there as a seminal album alongside the Beatles Sgt. Pepper, Revolver, Rubber Soul, Jethro Tull's Stand Up, and any of the Top 100 MUST OWN albums of all time for Rock and Folk.  Argent's organ and keyboards are ABOVE and  BEYOND  the same class as Vanilla Fudge, Iron Butterfly -- and they are no amateurs!  And the vocals are so incredibly clear, melodious, harmonious, and original as the Beach Boys'  best work.  In fact, I love this CD's vocals and harmonies EVEN BETTER than the Beach Boys' best work because, to me, they are at least as artistically produced and musically arranged, if not better than,....  'Nuff said!  I only wish I had discovered this GEM of a CD so many years ago!<br />Don't dismiss the excellent guitar work, either!
1401938906|1.0|I started to read this book and do the exercises. When the second exercise failed me, I lost interest. I am trying to get back to it and finish it without the exercises.  I am a very firm believer in manifestation but this book did not confirm that belief.
B009949RKC|3.0|What a great experience to recall how odd yesterdays films come off today.  Filmmaking techniques like speeding up a scene and hearing people talk like chipmunks to get through a boring conversation.  Oddly nervous and bad performances by peripheral characters for example John Travolta slapping his date was quite awkward, not because people used to slap each other back then, but the because the motivations felt pretty stilted.  That being said, this is totally worth a watch.  Sissy Spacek is fantastic and helps to make this odd story a classic horror film.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|This is a great book written by an amazing person!  She helped me, a 30 something housewife finally clean up her act!  The greatest little tidbit I have taken with me from this book for the last 10 years is I can do anything for 15 minutes!  Awesome Book!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I, myself, have wondered whatever became of that little boy from \\"The Shining\\". This story, like everything Mr. King has ever written, was riveting! It took me two and a half, mostly sleepless, days because I simply could not put it down. It was thrilling and show-cased Stephen King at his level best! Thank you, sir for many years of glorious chills and even for a few nights of sleeping with the lights on!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I am not sure about the star (something about the looks) although he does a FANTASTIC job!  Lucy is a great Joan Watson!  I will most definitely continue to watch this series!!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|If you have not seen this movie , you should .  It is the best one yet .  I love Danial Craig as Double 007.  Now I have it and can watch it any time I want too.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I loved this book and actually read another one.  When I am in the mood for this kind of book - Michael Connelly is GREAT writer!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so thrilled.  Finally candy crush is available on kindle!!!!  thanks Amazon.  I love this game.  loads and loads of fun.  can hardly put itdiwn
B007V65R54|5.0|He presents his information in a very readable format and provides a lot of examples and anecdotes to bolster his opinions. A math background is nice but not necessary to follow his reasoning. The book is very useful and an engaging read.
B00008J2PG|5.0|The Scarlet and the Black has action, suspense, and a great ending.  Best of all it is a true story of the selfless efforts of one priest and his companions to help enemies of the Nazis to hide or to escape from Rome during WWII.  In doing this they risk their freedom and their lives.<br /><br />This seems like a made-for-TV film, which I generally find to be of lesser quality.  But this one has A-listers Gregory Peck, Christopher Plummer, and Sir John Gielgud.  It's long at almost 2.5 hours but is definitely worth your time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I didn't like Stephen King's last book. The Kennedy alt history thing. Waaaaay too slow for me. In this book I feel like he's back to his page turning self. I really enjoyed it.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|When I say &#34;dark,&#34; I don't necessarily mean the content (though the content is also a bit &#34;dark&#34;).  The actually picture is SO dark.  During the day in my house, you can barely make out what is going on in most of the scenes.  If there's a glare from the window, forget about it.  How do you destroy the visual aesthetics of a pretty red-headed, blue eyed, princess?  Stick her in the dark woods for nearly the entire movie.<br /><br />For some reason, however, my two year old requests to watch this movie every single day.  The story is decent.
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|Fantastic read! This series is so much better than the tv series! I highly recommend reading the entire series from start to finish.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|And while I first thought the movie was great, I find now that it was more of a novelty that I've found to be less than memorable.
B004GGUG58|1.0|I have read several of Sedaris's books and thoroughly enjoyed them. However, this book is not up to standard. The stories are forced and really not funny at all. Was this written for the Christmas market?
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Kingsoft Office is a must have app for you device.  I give it a Five Star Rating.  I also use it on my laptop.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I have had so much fun throwing rocks, throwing bombs, and disintegrating bats. What a cute and fun game to play!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is the best dictionary app I have ever used on any electronic device thus far.  I would recommend this app as a must have.
B00127RAJY|5.0|So I must be out of the loop because most of these reviews are from 2008..haha however, I just started this DVD about a week ago and I LOVE IT so far. The first day was tough since I haven't really 'worked out' for about a year..besides taking an occasional walk or bike ride and being a 23 year old female I figured I should get in shape for the summer time! Like I said, I've only been doing it a week but in that week I lost 3 lbs and I didn't even do the DVD everyday! Obviously, you have to be eating right, too. I've been using the myfitnesspal app to count my calories (I highly recommend that app, it's a lifesaver). I am going to do this workout for longer than 30 days though--I've seen people call it the '60 day shred'..especially since I don't do it every single day (I try at least 5 days a week). I also love that you get a nice workout in a small amount of time-my work schedule doesn't give me much time to go to the gym so this 27 minute video is amazing and I feel great afterwards. GIVE IT A TRY. I will try to update this review as I get farther into my weight loss progress! LETS DO THIS!
0887307280|2.0|Gerber talks down to the reader in the form of a conversation to a baker named Sarah - for such a highly rated book, I was extremely disappointed.  Also MUCH confusion over which e-Myth book to read...
B003PBB4ME|3.0|I've always wanted a steadicam device, and now I have one. The price was right for sure. here's what I've learned:<br />1. I don't really have a need for this daily, but someday I will and I will have it.<br />2. steadiness is pretty good. good enough to justify the price.<br />3. the rubber elements are a bit stinky.<br />4. i will use my superzoom digital camera with it, not the compact camera.<br />5. i think it will be hard to use above the waist/mid-chest, because of awkward hand position, but I've chased the dogs around with it and that works just fine.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Great acting and script. When asked to explain how he knows something, for example when the murder victim is left handed, all the clues make sense.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple to install, easy to use, inexpensive. I usually can't get any electronic device to work without help but I had no problem with the Chromecast.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|If a 2 year old wants to sit on my lap just to watch it, it has to be good!

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Passing the rituals of moving from childhood to adulthood, no matter the circumstances, is painful, especially against the odds presented.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved the book I thought it was great I loved how funny Coach Hedge was he was hilarious !
1449305172|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone serious about starting their own company ! The concepts and especially approaches presented and described in this book honestly completely changed the way our team deals with product building. I think the real benefit of this book is its hands on approach towards reaching product/market fit.  I'm simply surprised this book hadn't been written beforehand ! I couldn't recommend more this book to anyone.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome just got it and really like it almost didn't get it. Graphics are nice and will be playing as much as possible.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Thank you for the movie it was in great condition. I will defintitly recommend it to my other friends. once again thank you

B00000637V|5.0|In the early 1970s, rock critics who had spent most of the previous decade overrating everything that the genre's major stars released (let's be honest, folks: \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", \\"Pet Sounds\\" and \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" are indeed great albums, but are they really THAT great?) suddenly did an about-face and took to savaging wholesale the often-brilliant offerings of popular music's next generation. Artists like Led Zeppelin, Neil Young, Black Sabbath and David Bowie were all too frequently dismissed and/or excoriated by a critical class whose venom seemed to grow all the more sour as those same acts' album sales soared. Even Dylan came in for some of it with 1970's \\"Self Portrait\\", which is now being \\"reexamined\\" by rock journalists in light of the recent \\"Bootleg Series\\" update of what was, in retrospect, one songwriter's flawed-but-worthy tribute to his contemporaries.<br />  That said, Lou Reed's 1973 LP \\"Berlin\\" received such a critical lashing upon its release as to be almost laughable, since any thinking person - then or now - who gives this album even a single spin can immediately appreciate its brilliance. Recycling a handful of unreleased Velvet Underground tracks, along with the title tune from his ignored 1972 debut solo album and a few fresh compositions, Reed here crafted what to my ears, at least, is his single greatest recording (\\"Rock & Roll Animal\\", of course, being all about the astounding touring band Reed would put together a couple of months hence rather than the Maestro himself). It is dark, it is dismal and it is unrelenting in its brutal message about the human condition - beautifully encapsulated here in the tale of two lovers in (presumably) prewar Berlin, though it might just as easily be the Berlin - or New York, Tokyo or any other city - of 1973. All of Reed's signature themes - drugs, kinky sex, despair, infidelity, suicide and above all the almost obscene hope that arises in the face of these things - are here given their ultimate treatment, and Bob Ezrin's grandiose production, far from weakening their message, serves only to underscore it in the most effective manner. If \\"Transformer\\" offered listeners the light, free and easy side of Reed's demimonde stomping grounds, \\"Berlin\\" may be seen as that album's older, wiser and far stronger sibling, a walk on a wild side from which there is no coming back except in a box. That the artist achieves his desired effect so perfectly makes \\"Berlin\\", note for note, one of the most worthwhile albums ever recorded. No, you can't dance to it, and you certainly wouldn't want to throw it on to get your date - or yourself, for that matter - \\"in the mood\\"; but if there is a more powerful argument anywhere out there for rock music as a valid and serious art form, I've certainly never heard it.<br />  So long, Lou. To borrow - and warp - a line from Duke Ellington, we miss you madly., and Bob Ezrin's grandiose production, far from weakening their message, serves only to underscore it in the most effective manner.

0061914177|4.0|I see some of the reviews gave 2 stars. I'm giving it four stars and here's why. It's got some good stuff. And it helps, and it's encouraging to be audacious!  And I think that's important. As a coach and business owner it's always a temptation to be the same as everyone else and to conform. But Gary reminds us that when we just relax, be ourselves (well a bigger brighter more amplified version of ourselves ) and not get into the perfection trap before we do it. Great reminder Gary. Thanks. I'm taking a leaf out of Gary's book to start a bunch of videos and articles for my voice coaching biz [...]
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was getting bored with matching colors or busting bubbles. I was searching for something more challenging. I came across this app and passed several times since it looked spooky. I read reviews and decided to try it. I love this game. I haven't played anything else since downloading it. Give t a try. You won't be disappointed.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a nice app. Does what it says it will. I like being able to set a timer that plays my music. Worth the price.
B000E6EGXM|5.0|Excellent version of Britten War Requiem..none can beat it so far.  The music will feel you with joy. A great recording.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|I have always loved jazz and would recommend this app for everyone to listen to. Great radio station with a lot of choices.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This was a good story which could have been great if it was not rushed towards the end.  It was good that after such a horrible marriage she had her brother's estate to fall back on(it sucks that he died), and that allowed her to cultivate some much needed self worth.<br />Additionally, she inherited her brother's adopted family where she found love and caring which is a salve to all the wounds and scars her worthless husband gave her. To top it off, in streaks Boomer, all black and white and wet and needy; much the same as she was months prior, needing to come out of the cold.<br />I am disappointed that Todd's persona had not been developed beyond that point as I feel I don't know him enough for her to marry him (:D).<br />I haven't read the blurbs of your other books but I sense a novel surrounding Allison and Ric perhaps?<br /><br />J.

B000026E2C|5.0|It seems that Wishbone Ash Four is the dividing line for the fans. There is the group that loves the first three albums and not much after and the group that love from Wishbone Ash Four. This is album is the biggest selling album and it is great to finally have it on cd! Overall I still have mixed feelings on the music it is a good album but I tend to stay in the group that loves the first three! But this is still a classic release it deserves to be on cd. Well worth having in your Wishbone Ash Collection! Very good job on the transferring and mastering, Nice liner note at a good price makes this a great deal!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I really enjoyed this book and gobbled it up in a few<br />days.  Not quite as dramatic as &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;, tho!
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|If you are a diehard Eagles fan you will enjoy this. You already know the music....here is the story behind it! Full of juicy info every Eagles fan will want to know. My only complaint is the concert DVD is too short.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Even thought this device only works with a few apps currently, its price and simplicity make it a winner.<br /><br />Setup is very simple. Plug it into the HDMI or your TV and walkthrough the setup process to get on the wireless network. Make sure you have the Chromecast apps on your devices and start streaming to the TV.<br /><br />The only problem is the lack of apps. When that is fixed this device will be well work 5 stars.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It's a good app , it's legit . If you sense problems occurring just restart your kindle. (Shut off only) Then wait 1-5 mins . #ThumbsUp
0394800184|5.0|I've never bought used books online before, so I was skeptical at first. But it was in great condition seems brand new, as if it's never been used.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have the Kindle 4 -when will Candy Crush be available for this version? I know it is highly addictive but I would really love to have it. PLEASE AMAZON - find it for my regular Kindle. My daughter adores the game and plays it all of the time.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  Very true to the book..more so than book adaptations usually are in my opinion.  The intensity of the end fight scene is maybe lost a little on film...and hard to translate believably to film but all and all it works.  I love how this story makes you think about what you are capable of if you have no other choice and the questions of mortality it brings to the surface.  A very mind opening and humbling experience.  Intelligently done as a novel and the movie does a good job reflecting that.
1451666179|5.0|This book was worth waiting for. Allie's confessional book showcases the kind of shame the rest of us often hide, which we shouldn't because it is often funny as she shows. Dogs are also funny, at least her ones are, and some of the funniest moments are about dogs, like her dog that pretends to be &#34;situationally quadriplegic&#34; when it comes time to leave the dog park. I recommend this book for those who've had depression or who want to understand it, because she writes about it in a way that is clearer than any medical faq on the internet. Her crude self-portrait is expressive in ways that a more detailed drawing would obscure. If you're a fan of sarcasm and hyperbole, you will love Hyperbole and a Half.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|This album is fun.  I really enjoy it.  I think I can sum it up by quoting my 4 year old daughter when she heard it for the first time in the car ... &#34;What is this Disney Music?&#34;  Somehow that sums it up for me...it's like fun adult kid music.
B00FVZAPB8|4.0|I bought the one from Target for $16.99 last night.  Seems to be the same one as this.  Mine says exclusively at Target. They also had the non deluxe version in red with only 10 songs  for $11.99.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|A fun game that doesn't suck up all your time. cute dragons, too. You can breed the dragons too make new hybrids
1449305172|5.0|This book has been an invaluable resource to the entrepreneurs we serve daily. Instant add to my entrepreneurial library.<br /><br />Thanks Ash!
B000FA675C|4.0|Much has been written about this book. I don't care that it's not the finest piece of literature; it's still entertaining. I won't go through the whole plot or anything, but it's a pretty good book and an easy read for vacation. It's certainly better than the movie. The pace is fast, the plot twists enticing and an original plot.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|There have been several times when I received a bill late or not at all. If not for this app my payment would have been late.  Also makes budgeting easier.
B005UT29Z0|1.0|While I enjoyed the acting and the intrigue, I was thoroughly disappointed at the end. I was left feeling sorry only for the dog and its owner. If there was a resolution to the story, I must be too simple-minded to have ascertained it. I simply cannot abide a story that leaves the reader/watcher without some benefit of resolve.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really good, would have preferred a different ending but still an great book to read. Would defiantly recommend to anyone.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book was highly recommended and I can see why!  I could see this being made into a movie.  Great characters.
B00723NWJE|5.0|The cd is very good,I like all the songs.very good I look forward to get more of her cds in the feature.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|I have not been a big fan of Rudess-era Dream Theater, as I felt the band last that organic touch, the grooviness that you hear on songs like &#34;6:00&#34; or &#34;Take the Time.&#34; This time around, though, something has breathed new life into the band. I don't think James LaBrie has ever sounded better. The basslines are aggressive for the first time since the band's early days. The band explores textures and musical concepts that they really haven't before. All in all, it's a strong return to form.<br /><br />A few minor criticisms: (1) I feel the drums are badly mixed. (2) The album still doesn't &#34;breath&#34; or &#34;groove&#34; like they did prior to SFAM. (3) While the guitar playing is very good, John Petrucci has been better.<br /><br />Bottom line: Dream Theater fans will enjoy this album, and that's really all that matters.
B00005YW4H|5.0|On this cd ,The song come away with me is awesome,every in my house love this song also the rest of the selections.
B00E6890RG|4.0|I'm relatively new to this band, having only discovered them this year. This third album seems like their lightest of the bunch, but what I like about it is that it fuses old school 70s prog with modern prog metal and djent in a way that doesn't come off gimmicky. The guitar playing is ridiculously good. All in all, a very strong release and I'm already looking forward to the next one.
B00018D44U|5.0|This cd is the kind that you can sit back,and relax after a day on the go.you can put it on the cd player and enjoy the whole cd.
B008GFI4KY|4.0|Let me start by saying that I like the Darkness, but I *love* Hot Leg. I realize that puts me in the minority among Darkness fans, so take this review for what you will.<br /><br />The strengths of this album are that it rekindles the unbridled masculinity of the Darkness' best riffing and fuses it with the clever melodies of Hot Leg without over-doing it like they did on &#34;One Way Ticket to Hell... And Back.&#34; Basically, it's the perfect reunion album, drawing on all of the band's strengths and none of their weaknesses. If you liked Permission to Land, you'll like this.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Chromecast was easy to install and use. Works great with YouTube and Netflix, but I was under the impression that if I saw it on my iPad, I would be able to see it on my flatscreen.  Once in a while, my iPad won't find the chromecast and it becomes a pain. I am confident with time that google will upgrade a lot of software so it works with more apps.
B008ANFRG6|3.0|When Vai gets self-indulgent, he doesn't play a 10-minute wanky guitar solo. Instead, he goes new age and starts writing bad show tunes. This is always the under-current of his worst material. Unfortunately, there is a bit too much of this self-indulgence on this record.<br /><br />At his best, Vai can't be touched as a guitarist or a musician. The tones on this record are *REALLY* astoundingly beautiful. There are a couple of standout songs that have Vai at his best, but the voice-over on the opening track is infuriatingly distracting, the whole &#34;John the Revelator&#34; business is about 10 minutes too long, and the Creamsicle song draws a bit too heavily from Zappa.<br /><br />It's a decent album - Vai would have to try pretty hard to COMPLETELY blow it. But it's definitely not his strongest.<br /><br />Since I bought the deluxe edition, I'll add a few words about the DVD.<br /><br />The documentary is bizarre and makes me squirm in my seat. The interviews are completely staged. It starts out okay, if a little cheesey, and then suddenly devolves into some SERIOUS over-sharing on Vai's part. I appreciate that he wanted to open up to his fans, but this is not the way to do it. It is totally self-absorbed, feels extremely disingenuous, and as I mentioned, makes the viewer very uncomfortable. I cannot imagine what sort of person would watch it more than once for anything other than anthropological purposes.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|this game is very cute and fun for the a Halloween season. love the graphics and puzzels. my kids are really enjoying it too.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|This album hearkens back to the band's glory days as 70s prog-rockers. Big concept album with philosophical lyrics and lots and lots of experimentation and lengthy self-indulgence. You can tell that Geddy Lee's voice is aging, but if you can get beyond that, you're in for a great ride.<br /><br />What I like best about this album are the innovative melodies. The band's sense of melody has truly evolved into something really special. That should be obvious to anyone familiar with their work from &#34;Test for Echo&#34; and beyond. They continue to carve new musical territory, but these days rely mostly on song structures and melody to tell the most exciting stories. If you're looking for YYZ, you're not going to find it here, but if you're looking to get lost in a haunting world of great prog rock, you can't go wrong.
B00D28TNT6|5.0|I bought this on vinyl and I sat mesmerized for the first half of the album, then flipped it over and was actually sad when it was over. I wanted more, like a drug addict, I needed more!<br /><br />This music will tell you a story, take you places, but you must really listen to hear the layers of sonic beauty. From the outside this might sound like noise to some, but once you settle in its beautiful and uplifting.<br /><br /> This is not what I would call background party music, it must be listened to. Headphones or speakers, park yourself and enjoy.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|I've come to the conclusion that Joe Satriani couldn't release a bad album if he tried. This isn't my favorite Satch record, but there is absolutely nothing bad to say about it. I could nitpick some of the rhythmic choices Colaiuta made, but why bother? This is a group of the world's best rock musicians playing at the top of their game. Enough said.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have not seen the movie yet but the first volume of the series is really rivetting. Every night I read a few pages and it is hard to put down. A must read for anyone who likes fantasy, sci fi and suspense.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Awesome game love it, you should try it out your don't even have to be a hunter to like.the game.
B0000AGWLA|5.0|When I first heard this album back in 1970 or so, the sound was so alien to me that I disliked it.  It was like no other albums I'd heard before with its mix of old English and other conglomerations of ethnomusic world influences.  It seemed to be a weird hodgepodge of sounds with no direction.<br /><br />But I was drawn to this strange music, sucked in deeper until I began to kind of get it.  Magical, mystical, yet earthy, historical, and totally real. It's like a hippie dream that proves to be the most real music of all when you've awoken.<br /><br />The lyrics are often arcane, but if you sort them out they mostly make sense.  I'm not a poetry/lyric focused sort of listener, but the words totally fit the music with sublime excellence.  It's the music that's where it's at for me on this album.  Such a diverse blend of the usual guitars with an array of fiddle, whistle, harpsichord, harmonica, and percussion.  And too many more instruments to name here.  This album is like a museum of musical instruments and musical styles.<br /><br />Artfully performed, the songs will sound weird to most at first, but if you give the music a chance, permeate your being, and let it carry you away to imaginative corners of your mind, this album may capture your musical mind and heart much as it has mine and so many others who love this album and the artists on it.<br /><br />I've listened to this album for around 40 years now and like it more each time I put it on my player.  This is the essence of real music for me that cannot be explained appropriately with words.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this album is incredible.  But I guess the band's name already says that.<br /><br />Note: I'm currently listening to this from the original Electra vinyl.  I also have a copy on CD.  When available I'll have this album implanted into my brain.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Bought this to add to my collection even though I've seen every episode on TV.  I love the DVD's because they have behind-the-scene looks at the series.  Passing this to my daughter and son-in-law so they can get caught up and bought another one for my son, who does not get AMC.  He and his wife have to wait a whole year for each episode.  I don't see how they can stand the wait!  The Walking Dead is AWESOME.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book sparked my inner imagination, I was inspired by many quotes, it helped to reinforce my knowledge of Tesla; overall a great quick read!
B002ZG99CC|5.0|This is now one of my favorite movies.  Love Jaden and Jackie together.  I like this better than the original.  Sent a copy to my 8 year old grandson who announced - Nana is the best!!  Highly recommend for all ages.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book not only was enjoyable - it was educational.  It caused me to research the past and learn about, understand and feel something I did not know about before.  I encourage you to read this book - especially if you like historical novels and breathless epics.  Thank you, Mr. Folett!
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I enjoyed the board game version of Carcassonne so i decided to try the mobile version.  It's a great version enabling you to play against computer opponents as well as other live players (though in a &#34;pass the tablet&#34; way instead of online (I would really love to be able to play against friends online).  You can have up to 4 players and the game even included one of the expansions packs.  The animations are fun though some of the AI comments get repetitive (you can turn this off in the settings though).  This is a bit hard to play on a phone (given the screen size) but it works great on a tablet (you can pan and zoom as needed to see the board).  In general I've enjoyed playing this in the tablet version and would recommend it if you like the &#34;offline&#34; version.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game!<br />That being said,  I gave up on my Kindle and bought a Samsung. Largely because Candy Crush wasn't available. Also  games that I did buy advertising &#34;For Kindle Fire&#34; DON'T WORK ON KINDLE FIRE and most of the games are geared towards kids. Now, 2 weeks after I buy the Samsung here is the game. I think I will keep playing on the Samsung.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|This book was kind of boring. A few good parts, but the worse of all if the song if ice and fire books. In really disappointed. It seems as though a lot of things that wasn't relevant went too much into detail. And most of all, too many main characters dying in these books, it's ok for a few but at some point people don't want to read anymore because they know the disappointment will come! Sad.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|i would rate this movie excellent movie and my  (first time) on Prime experience very good. I will be signing up !!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited to finally join in all the fun! It had been previously unavailable to my Kindle Fire HD. Thanks!
B008XCM18Q|5.0|I understand the need to tell simple stories in the film medium, but the depth of the written version makes the film pale by comparison.
B00BATKPBE|4.0|Lovely, lyrical inner professorial voice unfolding the mysteries of scientific data in an emerging computer world. We learn the human side behind the data.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I like the NCIS series; I have bought all 10.  The writers are extremely creative; have maintained character credibility; keep one watching each episode being aired on weekly TV.  Being able to watch the episodes without commercial interruptions and again in sequence -- if you happened to miss something -- is most enjoyable.
B000OVLINI|4.0|well written.<br />very interesting<br />Historical date.<br />Intriguing.<br />love it from beginning to end of the book<br />I couldn't put it down until I finish it
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|fun but I would like more trial time before having to buy. the hidden objects have plenty of difficulty. interesting storyline.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|For a few years, I have been a &#34;fan&#34; of TED talks. I find this is a source of inspiring, interesting, creative information by excellent speakers, in hundreds of conferences for all types of public. I have used TED also for my classes (I teach in highschool). Now I found the TED App for my phone, so I can check more frequently what's new, and even listen to the talks while in the traffic!
B000002J1U|5.0|In 1970, Led Zeppelin tried something new... they made a much more folk rock/acoustic album. The album is a milestone for the band as Robert Plant's voice makes it's legendary falsetto debut. The band also ditches its blues rock sound for the most part. The band really tried something new on this album and proved that they weren't just confined to blues/hard rock.<br /><br />The tracks on the album are as follows:<br /><br />1. Immigrant Song<br />2. Friends<br />3. Celebration Day<br />4. Since I've Been Loving You<br />5. Out On The Tiles<br />6. Gallows Pole<br />7. Tangerine<br />8. That's The Way<br />9. Bron-Y-Aur Stomp<br />10. Hats Off To (Roy) Harper<br /><br />There was also another song that never saw the light of day from this album's sessions, &#34;Hey Hey (What Can I Do)&#34;. Many argue that the song should have been on the album and I agree. Instead it ended up as the b-side of the Immigrant Song single. It did end up as a bonus track on Coda though.<br /><br />This album is a MUST HAVE!!!
1878424319|5.0|This little book is an incredible guide ot life itself.  I try to apply these simple agreements to my daily life.
B000002J03|5.0|After Led Zeppelin's debut album got some negative criticism from the press, the band recorded a new album the same year, not near ready to quit! They embarked on a tour in the USA and blew the very popular Iron Butterfly right off the stage after opening for them! Legend has it they blew The Doors off stage too! Their loud, hard hitting stage show held them garner a significant following in the states, thus Led Zeppelin II helped break the band into wide success for the rest of their career!<br /><br />Led Zeppelin II continues in the hard rock found on the debut. Tracks n the album are as follows:<br /><br />1. Whole Lotta Love<br />2. What Is And What Should Never Be<br />3. The Lemon Song (Killing Floor)<br />4. Thank You<br />5. Heartbreaker<br />6. Living Loving Maid (She's A Woman)<br />7. Ramble On<br />8. Moby Dick<br />9. Bring It On Home<br /><br />This album quickly hit #1 in both the USA and the UK. You MUST own it!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved the story... I have yet to see the movie, and I bet it shall be different.... but it is a great story
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product<br />small and handy and at very low price<br />It fits well the TV and connected well to my home WIFI and my laptop<br />Only &#34;problem&#34; is that apple wants money for the &#34;free&#34; app<br />while it is fee for Android and Chrome
B0084IG8TM|3.0|Priceline could be better...because it came without any description to the Movie, inside the cover. The DvD looks new and works perfect.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|First let me start by telling you the one and only complaint I had...<br />The instructions are TERRIBLE!!!!<br />Luckily the assembly is pretty straightforward and can be figured out with very little brain power.<br />I gave this product a 5 star rating as the pros far out weight the cons, this is the best toy I have ever brought, ever!<br />My son loves this thing, loves it so much he bounces until he falls asleep on it. Got several Facebook pics to prove it ;)<br />The bouncer is solidly built with materials of high quality, stitching on cloth is tight and really soft so you don't have to worry about your child being uncomfortable.<br />Our son has used this bouncer for over 3 months and its still in great condition, he loves the toy variation and the seat swivels so smoothly he has no issue turning to play with the next toy.<br />The bouncer also has a battery powered music and animal sound player which you will need a screwdriver for and 3 AA batteries. Its well worth it though as the animal sounds are triggered by moving one of the toys and it keeps our son constantly laughing.<br />All in all this is a great toy made of high quality materials and with a lot of thought put into installing toys with features and colors that a young boy would love and not get easily bored of.<br />btw if you like this toy also try the jungle gym of this same brand (Has a giraffe in one of the corners). They are both well worth the price.

B008745B32|1.0|I was looking for a Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility type book only fast forwarded toward World War I England.  Even with reading the sample from Kindle, I did not see what was coming--homosexuality.  For starts, the author &#34;Evelyn&#34; is a male???  I don't care how literarily beautifully it is couched.  It is what it is.<br /><br />I am in agreement with God's Word about men with men and women with women--it is sin and the wages of sin is death!  Period.  I'm not saying I hate anyone, nor does God, but I--like Him--hate the sin and seriously do find it repulsive!<br /><br />Joyce
B001F12J0C|5.0|Its great to get them for $15 instead of paying $30 on itunes or another download version.  Bourne is a great movie
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|Yuck!  Yuck!  Yuck!  Oh, by the way, did I mention Yuck!?  Thought that, with an eccentric FBI sleuth and a NYC cop and Nazis implicated, this might be a good, intense mystery.  I just couldn't keep sludging through the blood and guts to ever find out.  Does everything have to be so graphically described?  Furthermore, I couldn't keep up with the zigzagging from person to person and setting to setting.  If I have to carry a notebook to keep track of the players and their doings, I'll get myself a different book.<br /><br />Joyce
B00BE97ONM|3.0|A bit crude at times, but I suppose it comes with the violence.  It had a few interesting twists, but I could unfortunately predict the ending.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Who would have believed that an adult could remember his childhood well enough that he could write a book that would finally, once and for all, put the myths about how children think in the grave.  Card has actually caught what IMHO we all as children growing up thought. To many of us adults forget the pressures and maturity of growing up, and focus only on the immature behavior of our childhood. Thank you, Mr. Card for giving children that voice.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Normally only allow my 9 year old daughter view G or PG movies.  But this was an exception!  Our family of five raved and discussed this movie for days afterwards.  It is clever, humorous and action packed with twists and turns. Think Oceans 11 with cell phones.<br /><br />The one awkward adult part is in the beginning of the movie where a magician and a newly admiring fan do a little ro sham bo in his apartment. They were interrupted by a mysterious happening and she picks up her strewn clothing and leaves in a huff.<br /><br />I dont remember any bad language - but Im unfortunately desensitized anything but the F-bomb.
B00EWNJJIK|5.0|She's still in my heart, these remixes will keep her alive for ever. Very tastefully done, you couldn't ask for better. This vinyl LP sounds fantastic with Donna in the spot light vocally. It's hard to believe some of these tracks are over 30 years old but sound like they were recorded yesterday for the next generation of dancers to discover if they didn't know them already. Miss that Angel's voice but this will keep us dancing for a long time.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Im a Denzel fan.  He played his character really well - spot on!  There is one unnecessary scene where a woman is shown naked many times as she walks around the room.  Dont watch with your inlaws or skip that scene.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|lots of fun in each level. great game. i love that each level adds something new and they continue to add more levels.
0061122416|1.0|This novel does not contain the amount of wisdom that some say it does. Many of the ideas are impractical and often contradictory and seem aimed at people experiencing midlife crises. Through the poorly constructed story heavily borrowed from the parable, The Dream, Coehlo preaches to follow your dreams. He offers pearls of &#34;wisdom&#34; such as, &#34;People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being&#34;, which is almost always completely false, and, one of my favorites, &#34;When I'm eating, that's all I think about&#34;(24, 84). The book also has it's extremely sexist moments, such as the conversation between Santiago and his object of desire, Fatima, during which Santiago asks Fatima why she is crying and she responds with the cringe-worthy statement, &#34;I'm a woman of the desert, but above all, I'm a woman&#34;(122). If this is considered wisdom, then I fear for the future of women's rights. While it is very possible to gain wisdom through literature, the best wisdom has practical uses, and insipid ramblings about &#34;the soul of the world&#34; do not serve any practical purposes.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|*Review from [...]*    WARNING: THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS. LIKE BIG TIME SPOILERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  *  *  *  *    Another series has come and gone, but very few have gone out in such a bang as Allegiant did. Veronica Roth took a risk and did something we rarely see in YA fiction: she killed off her main, point of view, character, and I bow down to her for it. I have a lot to say about that, but let me start with this: The book couldn't have ended differently. No matter how upset you are or how much you hate Veronica Roth now, this is the ending she thought would best suit the story, and she's one hundred percent vindicated for it. You can (and should because it's quite beautiful) read her response here.    Don't get me wrong, I cried like a baby. So much so that I had to make myself a cup of tea and watch the entirety of Dirty Dancing at 3 a.m. in order to stop feeling so upset. But I love that Tris died, and I love how it ended, so if you want to hate me for that, go for it.    Here's what I liked: First off, I really liked the entire genetic experiment plot line. It was completely unexpected and I thought it was a realistic concept for what was outside the city. There was also a lot of room for all that drama to go down so that was a nice touch, and I appreciate her adding some interesting new characters to the story. I loved that Tobias forgave his mother. I never hated Evelyn, I disliked the lengths she was willing to go to to \\"save\\" the city, but I never hated her. She was doing what she thought was best. But I'm glad that she and Tobias were able to put it in the past and patch up their relationship, it was what Tobias needed. With his father being the awful human that he was, and Tris dying, it wouldn't have been fair to leave Tobias all on his own.    What I didn't like: I love that it was in dual point of view, but I feel like there wasn't a lot of difference in tone between Tobias and Tris. Now, it wasn't horrible and I could still tell whose POV we were in, but it would have been nice to see a difference in the way they thought (though maybe that makes them even more perfect together?). That's the short list of what I didn't like, and we can now move on to my spiel on Tris's death.    This is important. Rule number one. If you never take away anything from any of these posts but this, that would be okay. Never, never, never threaten an author because you didn't like the way a book ended. Threats aren't okay, guys, and from what I've heard, Veronica got a lot of them. Like I said before, she wrote what would best serve the book and she planned this from the very beginning of the series. You're all entitled to your own opinions, and emotional responses are the best, but just don't threaten writers because you didn't like their decisions. Not cool.    Now here's why I think Tris's death was possibly one of the greatest things to happen in YA history, and maybe what caused this book to head to the top of my favorite series list: It was the ultimate sacrifice. Like the lovely Shailene Woodley said in an interview, Tris is constantly battling between being fearless and being selfless, being Dauntless or Abnegation. In the end, she didn't have to choose between the two, they were both a part of who she was. By sacrificing her life for her city and the people she loved, she was fearless and selfless, a true member of both factions. Tris gives a beautiful speech before she dies that really shows why this had to happen. On page 473, she says, \\"She [her mother] taught me all about real sacrifice. That is should be done from love, not misplaced disgust for another person's genetics. That is should be done from necessity, not without exhausting all other options. That is should be done for people who need your strength because they don't have enough of their own.\\" This is a completely different girl from the start of the series, this is a woman who has been through hell and back and has made the decision to do what's best for other people. And she's not terrified, she accepts it. Hello, character development. Also as a side note, Tobias's reaction is heartbreaking and very real. He's angry and he's numb and he carries it with him forever. That part was, to me, harder to read than the actual death scene itself. Four for you Veronica Roth, you go Veronica Roth. (Other side note, if you really want to have a good cry, read the death scene and listen to \\"Oblivion\\" by Bastille... and then prepare for the waterworks)    Those are my thoughts, and you can agree or disagree as much as you want. I just think it was a poetic ending and I wouldn't want to change a thing. I could talk about this book for days, and I would like to apologize to the people who are still having to listen to me talk about it. So, thank you, Veronica. Thank you for taking the risk and having the guts to write your story the way it wanted to be written. Thank you for letting us all be a part of Tris's life and adventures, the good and the bad. Thank you.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|Erin is great! I see this video is so popular, why oh why don't they retape it with a decent videocamera?  This one is done so cheaply and with cheesy effects.<br /><br />Once you get past that, I thought it was great.  I am only in my 1st trimester, but I really enjoyed the workout.  I was working out moderately before hand and didn't find it difficult to keep up nor was it too easy.<br /><br />Erin - make some more videos and get someone decent to produce them for you!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Excellent film of the Victor Hugo classic. Hugh Jackman plays a great Jean Valjean, and Russell Crowe is great as the ubiquitous inspector Javier.
B003204MQS|1.0|Beyond bad.  Replaced my previous pick for the worst movie ever.  Stupid. Boring. Plotless. The producers must be laughing all the way to the bank for the money they've made off this thing. Watching paint dry is more exciting. Do not waste your money. Don't trust anyone's judgment ever who tells you that this movie is worth seeing.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I read this a month ago and have been gluten free since.  I've lost 10 pounds and feel great.  I'm rereading the book just to reenforce what I've learned.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I love this adapter.  I use it with my iPad 2 to watch Netflix on my HD TV, and it works flawlessly.  Just like with everything else, you have to consider that you should familiarize yourself with operating the device when the HDMI cable is hooked up (the screen goes black on the device when Netflix comes up), but a little practice makes this a must have addition to a cable collection.
B001X0ZKM4|5.0|Best ever, loved Michael Keaton as Batman. Michelle Pfiffer was great. Didn't like Danny Devito with black goo from his mouth, otherwise good movie.
0061900656|3.0|Cute book but my nephew is a little young for it (1 1/2 years) since he isn't really talking yet and it talks about eating pizza, ice cream, etc so if you don't want your kids eating unhealthy, this is not the book for you! Also not geared toward anyone breastfeeding since baby takes a bottle. Just a few items to consider but cute idea for maybe a 2-3 year old child about to be a big brother. Didn't love the illustrations and prefer board books at that age since pages would be easy to tear.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Google Chromecast is a Piece of Crap, Total Crap, so don't even think about getting one or dealing with Google...wasted hours trying to activate it to the point where Google owes me, and the rest of us, big bucks for our time.  Google deserves nationwide class action suits and the rest of us are entitled to a free device that actually works within seconds, not minutes. And should it take hours, hope the ambulance of lawyers slap on more class action suits and collect big fees and punitive damages.  How Google can be so shameless, arrogant, and self-deluded with this piece of S*** is beyond me.  But then again, witness Polaroid and Xerox.  Sergei, Teller, etc., are you listening?  This should be another wake-up call for your strategy and for your incompetent honchos.  And you people at Amazon should be sued for aiding and abetting a massive fraud that you knew or should have known about based on your own buyer comments and reviews.  Shame on you Amazon.  And shame on you Google for insulting our intelligence and kindling our wrath...
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Very easy to use and fast,takes just seconds to update yourself. I enjoy this app and would recommend to others.
B005PK553C|5.0|I love this show.  Good script, great acting, and just enough creep factor to keep me watching - in fact, I can't stop watching it!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I love it it's a good one. One of the best games I've played in a while. You have got to get it.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Very entertaining movie with some interesting plot twists. &#34;The Four Horsemen&#34; are gonna entertain you but don't believe your eyes or in this case &#34;the eye&#34; (explained in the movie). Great set up, great acting, I can't say much about the movie because I don't wanna spoil anything, so go see get it and see it even more than once.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|The clean master is awesome. Why would you not want a free efficient cleaner ask yourself that. This app is great
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|It was a great game, kind of sad that the game is almost over cuz i've solved most of it. But it a great puzzle game.
B006MOW98E|5.0|I loved this book. Everything was confusing at first and then it all tied together. It was amazing. Wish it was longer!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Great story I could not put it down.  The end was a pleasant surprise.  I loved how skillfully the author moved back and forth from present day to the past.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|If your in pinch and boating a 10 hour flight you can't go wrong with Jack Reacher. Plot are interesting with unexpected turns.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't  say anything yet as I have not had a chance to see it.  It came today.  However based on the other two DVDs,(Season #1 and #2) it will be great.  It takes me several days to see a DVD as I work out on our treadmill while I view it.  Am sure anyone who buys this DVD will receive a lot of enjoyment.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|A good old action movie, visually stunning! A little short on story though. I recommend seeing it in HD and surround sound, A treat for your senses. Giant kick ass robots named after alcohol (Jäger ) What's not to love!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It's so awesome a book it has no need for nuance. The 80's references do not stop and continue well into the 90's and 00's. Even 2008's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is dropped. The main characters spend time quizzing each other on 80's-ish pop culture for entire chapters (actually the entire book is: Prove you know your culture, fool!) in an online cyberspace reminiscent of 1999's Matrix movie. Sure, The Dystopian future was better realized by Stephenson in 'Snow Crash', but you get to see hilariously stereotyped characters flounder around in utter poverty addicted to their online lives. If you want relentless 80's reference and quizzes this book is for you. Five Stars!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun, easy and relaxing.  Great to play when waiting, or bored!  You can play as long as you want and stop at anytime, then resume right where you were.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These cans are very light and comfortable to wear all day. The sound is very clear and the only limits I have on them are that I don't have a sufficient sound card to really hear them at their best. Hooking these up merely to onboard audio or an Ipod is kinda depressing. The AKG's are a nice step up from my senn 555's The senn's were a lot louder and crashing and the AKG's are more focused and rushing. The AKG's are highly recommended. Five Stars!
1451666179|5.0|As soon as Allie announced she was going to write a book, I knew I would be buying it.  I was very impressed when it arrived, because it was much thicker than I was expecting.  It's very well presented and of the material she included from her blog, there are absolutely no duds.  The new material is excellent a well.<br /><br />The only thing I found a bit odd was that Allie has gone back and re-drawn several panels of her older works.  The &#34;Clean ALL the things!&#34; and &#34;Internet forever&#34; panels especially caught my eye.  This isn't a bad thing.  I'm sure Allie was simply updating older pictures to her current style, it was just strange to see such familiar images being juuuust different enough to be noticeable.
B00881VLCE|2.0|It's a great app for puzzle junkies...until it starts crashing and you have to reinstall to play it again. I spend more time reinstalling the app than I do working a puzzle on the most difficult settings. PLEASE FIX THIS APP.
B00BUWY74M|5.0|I am only about halfway through this book, but already it has helped my training significantly. It should be on every triathlete's shelf.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Exhaustively researched and easy to follow. I highly recommend it, along with The Jesus Seminar, as to the origins of Christianity, and to what happened in the geopolitical world of that day to make the religion take hold.  A real eye opener for the believer and nonbeliever alike.
B007WZ55XI|5.0|Working through this book has given a deep understanding of how I can use a power meter to improve my training. It has made the investment in the vector garmin power meter equipped pedals that I have well worthwhile. Not having this book means you may not be really utilising what is otherwise an expensive investment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A really fun game. Gets the little grey cells working. Even my friend likes to play too!<br />Can we have more levels soon please!

B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great variety. Love the free version. Use it to wind down from work in the evenings. Very cool that you can later the sound and change the volume. Highly recommend!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't stop playing it. Best game ever. My sister does not usually play games but I got her stated on this on and she can't stop either.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is the most provocative book (purported) written by a small teen I have ever read.  I have been<br />impressed with several books recently, and wish there was a way to increase the rating to 10 stars.<br />Watching Malala respond to questions in several t.v. interviews, regardless of how much<br />help editing and researching some data in the book, she is a very capable young lady that<br />has been thru 'hell and back' .  She has lived to not just tell of her sad life journey but to help all<br />people all over the world understand with candor, Women's plight thru clear observations.<br />Descriptions of her Parents and Culture in what is now part of<br />Pakistan provide the reader with vivid memories in part because of her being a girl...Also the way<br />she tells her story.  Also because of her sensitive understanding of life itself.  The touching<br />scenes she lovingly created remain etched in your mind.  It is appropriate<br /> she has been awarded considerable recognition for her bravery incl. Nobel Peace Prize.

B00516G5W0|4.0|love the new world figures. comes with swords.  lvoe the bases and stands that come with these figures. do come with the funimation sticker but didnt see the toei stickers on boxes from amazon.<br /><br />only issue with this one and why it got 4 stars is because when i recieved the actual box was beat up pretty good but figure was ok.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book included such maturity in style.  Very well written with such a twisted turn of events.  I truly enjoyed reading the series and experiencing the growth of a writer.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books! Book three was a let down. I didn't like the alternating POV. Although it took a cool turn outside the fence, it didn't make up for the obvious action sequences in the compound. Not to mention I hated the ending.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This is a very enjoyable book.  The plot is a little implausible, and the lawyers are a little too stereotyped, but the book does try to send a serious message in a very readable format.  Well worth the price.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|A poignant movie about live.  Some nudity that did not detract from the actors' roles.  Helen was her typical by giving an outstanding performance!
B00DB31Y3U|2.0|It was just too choppy on my GS3, maybe I have to much running on my phone, either way it just didn't interest me.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I grew up watching the Tom Baker era Dr. Who episodes.  I was drawn to the 9th Dr Who Chistopher Eccleston episodes as they featured John Barrowman as Capt Jack  from the Torchwood Series<br />.  I found the episodes in which he appeared  quite entertaining and helped to fill in a lot of the  backstory of his character.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I think a lot of readers stayed in the station rather than jumping on board the train. I completed the book last night and felt that it was a good story told by a good story teller which seems to be the trend in the books designated as YA.  I feel sad by all of these hostile reviews and the shallow POV that the story was merely about relationships and conflict  without any mention of what is being said about our very real world set into a dystopian backdrop. As to the hostile comment clan, whom I label as the 'oh wah it's not what I wanted to happen mentality and I&#34;m owed my vision' write your own damned books wherein you can realize your vision.  It's a tale of the absolute corruption of absolute power and the unthinking use of that power based on profound ignorance and the great damage it does to society. I felt that Ms Roth did a great job in seating this morality tale into a setting that is easily understood.  While, at my age and I am well beyond being labeled as &#34;youth anything&#34; I applaud these authors whose initial aim is the youth market for challenging their young readers to think and in that regard for those who choose to take the challenge I think that Ms Roth has given you a lot to contemplate!
1611137527|2.0|Don't waste your time.  I ignored the WSJ bad reviews and muscled thru this book.  It starts off good but dies a slow, boring, monotonous death...........
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Even though it worked just fine, it interferred with the internal clock on my kindle fire, causing it to stop completely until I rebooted the kindle.  I removed the alarm clock app and the internal clock works fine now.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|YOU JUST CAN'T PUT IT DOWN. The author carriers you back from Time to Kill to present. YOU JUST CAN.T BEAT A JOHN GRISHAM NOVEL. RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE WHO LOVES TO READ.
B000P0I4O4|4.0|This movie has lots of action, making a person sit on the edge of their seat through nearly all of the movie.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love but hate the update just take a lot of time to get things but it was a hard to get it to update also
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game I love it I've played a lot of games like this and this one has to be my favorite. Better then farmville. It cane be slow at times and over sensitive to touch.
B00F56AZK4|3.0|I rated this in the middle but that might be unfair. I like jigsaw puzzles and because of my age(89) I shake a bit & I have to get accustom to pulling the pieces to the puzzle.  Perhaps in a couple months I'd rate this differently.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I choose this rating because the secret garden was a very inspiring book.<br />I would reccomend this book to anyone that loves to read.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|The RAM worked, and after I installed it, it added to my total RAM.<br /><br />With these simple things, the product is flawless.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Buttons are easy to read due to their large size. I have no issues or glitches with this app.Great find.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I love this application on my Note 2.  It offers great sound with no buffering and a lot of stations to choose from.
B001AQT0OU|4.0|a great movie. The quality of the Blue ray was OK, although I did observe it was made in Mx.
B00B19DW0E|5.0|John Carpenter made some of the best &#34;bad&#34; movies ever made.  This is one.  Kurt Russell's iconic &#34;Snake Plissken&#34; character over-acts his way through a dream world where New York City is turned into a Hell on Earth.  With today’s huge budget, special effect, bloated movies, it’s fascinating to see someone make something so entertaining with so little money.  Adrienne Barbeau’s cleavage doesn’t hurt either.
0060555661|4.0|The book looks like it's good. The only negative note I might have is, that it took ages to get here.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Andy Weir tells a tale using technology that is attainable to create a realistic combination of a situation in the near future that can be interwoven with the all-too-human attributes that transcend technology such as ingenuity, bravery, initiative and loyalty that make the impossible possible.
B001BANK32|5.0|Such a thrilling book. I was so scared I actually wanted to cover my eyes while reading. The visuals in my mind will haunt me forever.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman continues to astonish me with his ability to come up with fascinating, compelling characters, genuine stories and worlds that frighten and delight.  I can only attempt to imagine what it must be like to live in the world that is Mr. Gaiman's mind.
B007NZQU72|5.0|Reading this book has been a life changing event . . . who knew? It has opened my eyes to see strengths I have not acknowledged, to realize I am not alone, that I am unique, that I am not crazy, and is already helping me to see others in a different light. This is wonderfully written, easy to understand, and thankfully written by someone who lives it every day!  A friend told me about this book, and I have already purchased this book for another friend!  Thank you Dr. Aron!
1449437524|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother & he loved it.  So fun, so true, great laughs!  A must have for anyone who owns a dog!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Even though I guessed the reason for leaving the housekeeper his fortune before I was half finished, I enjoyed the entire book. I hope this won't be the last time I spend time with Jake and his colorful cohorts. Sycamore Row is Grisham at his best.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I only learned of breaking bad recently, and saw a few of the newer episodes. I knew I couldn't really appreciate the series until I started from the beginning, and I am glad I did. It is great so far, and I'm looking forward to purchasing the second season!
1449305172|5.0|Building new products that succeed doesn't need to be a black art. Unfortunately, there few books out there that break down repeatable methods for getting to product/market fit.<br /><br />Eric Ries's landmark \\"The Lean Startup\\" really woke me up to how important the Build-Measure-Learn loop is. What Ash has done is follow that up with this hands on \\"how to\\" book offering proven tools like the Lean Canvas to shape and hone your business and product ideas. I found his problem and solution interview technique also to work really well in products that I've built.<br /><br />I require everyone on my product teams to read this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game is irritating in the most engaging way humanly possible. It's so simple and yet so complex that it takes a good long while to parse the puzzles. For the amount of money I spent on it I felt I got my dollar's worth.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Watching this on Amazon Video. Great show with interesting, strong characters. The story of Florrick's incarceration as it affects Alicia and her family in their new life is well done. I'll be catching up on all the seasons soon.
0545123291|5.0|Fantastic series!  And I can't wait for her companion series coming soon for some of the Mercy Falls characters.  I was also extremely grateful for Maggie's youtube videos as she reads some of her writing to us and shares her heartfelt response to reader questions!  What an amazing treat!

B00AO7HQ06|5.0|Skydog is an excellent compilation of what seems to be every recording Duane Allman was involved in. As a long time Allman Brothers, and Duane fan, I was a little put off by the price, but after listening to all of the CDs, I can tell you it was well-worth the price. But, The Allman Brothers are the best-ever southern rock band and Duane is one of the best guitarists ever!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I needed a replacement for my kindle charger and amazon was kind enough to send me one at no charge since I have one of the older models of kidle. THANKS AMAZON!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|4.5/5 Stars<br /><br />Wow!! I had to wait a day or so to write this review because my head was just spinning when I put the book down (not to mention the fact that I was sobbing and needed time to catch my breath!). I think it really helped that I read all three of these books in a row because I really got to see the full arc of the story and the characters that way (without having to try to remember what it was I loved about the first two books). Plus, this way the series had momentum for me that would have been lost otherwise.<br /><br />The negatives:<br /><br />Failure to communicate.<br />Once again, there were periods in this book where Tris and Tobias had problems based mostly on their failure to communicate. Just when I thought that they were going to really work together and face the world as a team, they would disagree over something and then pretty much not talk to each other - it made me crazy! Tris' lack of compassion also got to me sometimes (for instance, she doesn't seem to understand why Tobias might have strong feelings about his father's sentencing and then, when she does realize it's bothering him, still doesn't bother to talk to him about it). Now, to give Roth some credit, there were parts of the story where Roth did have Tris and Tobias hash out their issues (and where they made good relationship choices) - I just wish I hadn't had to suffer through their lack of communication to get to it. (Although, honestly, the relationship might not have been all that unrealistic - lack of communication is a real issue in lots of relationships!)<br /><br />Some people will HATE the ending.<br />I honestly feel sorry for any author who is ending a hugely popular series like this one because it seems that there is no way to truly satisfy everyone - all these people who are waiting for their story to come to an end and might not agree with how the author does it. This is one of those cases where I can tell you right now that many people are going to hate this ending. Roth doesn't let all of our beloved characters live happily ever after in a world where all their problems have been solved - nowhere even close to that. I list this as a negative because I know many people will see this as a big negative. Most people will either love it or hate it. But I'm actually kind of on Roth's side on this one - see my note below.<br /><br />What I LOVED:<br /><br />I didn't hate the ending.<br />Okay, that's not exactly true. In some ways I hated what happened at the end of the book. But I also felt that it made sense based on who Roth made these characters to be and the type of world they lived in. Was it painful, horrifying and gut-wrenching when certain characters we've come to know and love didn't get their happy ending? Definitely. Was it still amazing? I certainly thought so! I will not be forgetting this book any time soon - I can't stop mulling it over in my mind, and that is a sign of a fantastic story in my opinion!<br /><br />So many questions answered.<br />I LOVED that this book answered all of my questions and made sense of a lot of the holes in logic from the first two books. I mean, I really didn't get why the Divergent were supposed to go out into the outside world and how they were expected to save humanity. And why was it that people in the factions had such strong tendencies toward specific behaviors? (It was explained - there was an actual reason based on genetic experimentation that was done!!) I was honestly desperately worried that the answers I would be given in Allegiant would make no sense, so I sighed a huge sigh of relief when so many things were explained in ways that made sense to me! Yay!!<br /><br />Tobias' struggles.<br />I loved that we got to see half (or so) of this book from Tobias' viewpoint!! I was thrilled to see the world through his eyes and to really be able to see and sympathize with his struggles. Whereas, in the first book (and somewhat in the second), we got to see Tris' vulnerabilities and her struggles with who she was - selfless or brave - in Allegiant we got to see that Tobias, with only four fears, could still be haunted by those fears. In this book, it is Tobias who doubts who he truly is - what makes him who he is. Is it his genes, his upbringing, his choices? He struggles to come to terms with all of that and there are no easy answers. I grew to love Tobias even more in his weaknesses and was that much more behind him when he overcame them!<br /><br />The action.<br />The first half of this book didn't have nearly as much action as Divergent and<br />Insurgent, but I found myself so intrigued by learning about Tris and Tobias' world, that I actually didn't mind much. The second half of the book picked up the action quite a bit and there were enough twists and turns to keep me constantly wondering what would happen next.<br /><br />Allegiant gave us an explosive ending to a thrilling series! While it had a few negatives, this is not a series that I will soon forget and I'm not disappointed. I only hope that the upcoming movie does it justice!<br /><br />(I debated back and forth between 4 and 4.5 stars for this book, but when I compare it to other books that I rated 4 stars, I came to the conclusion that, even with its flaws, I enjoyed this book more than most.) 4.5/5 stars.ies and her struggles with who she was - selfless or brave - in Allegiant we got to see that Tobias, with only four fears, could still be haunted by those fears.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to be available for my kindle.  FINALLY it's here. Have candy crush on my phone, computer and now kindle.  Great way to fill any waiting time.  Lol
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|you'll love the soundtrack.  I liked enough songs that it made more sense to get the whole thing.  But it's exactly like the movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Didn't see it coming, but then again, neither did Ana. Can't wait for book 3!! This can't get any better
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I was very surprised by how much I liked this album.  It's definitely a different feel to Katy than her previous work.  I really like almost all the songs, and the extra 3 you get with the deluxe version are worth paying a little extra.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was my first book by this author and I thoroughly enjoyed it! The characters were well developed and I liked the twists and turns.
0307744434|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it's very different from what I would normally read, but well done. The POV is unique and I was really sucked into the magic. The love story was predictable as was the \\"twist\\" (how the winner of a game was determined), but I didn't feel that took away from the experience.<br /><br />My only complaint was that the magic at the end of the book was a bit hard to follow. It wasn't well-defined, I felt like the author herself didn't really understand it and therefore couldn't explain it well.<br /><br />Either way I would definitely read one of her books again in the future.
B00FFHG6KQ|3.0|Doesn't meet the standards to 2k sports, produced in China with obviously no budget or attempt to carry the 2k name forward. But it's your only choice for basketball so if you need NBA but it or your s.o.l

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love this free app.  Has some restrictions on sharing that you can only get with Premium,  but really easy to use.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This was a great book and worth the long wait. I really enjoyed the humor, the drawings and Brosh's wry take on life. More please.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Well great book and all but the ending didn't fit with the plot, I personally think Roth did it for attention but now all her readers hate her. READ THIS BOOK the ending is not good but you have to still read it!
1742204120|5.0|This is a hefty book at 1248 pages, but it is packed with information!  I'm impressed with how much they get into every page.  There aren't too many photos, but maps are provided when needed and there are lots of sidebars to give extra tidbits about those little details that can make or break a trip.  Most locations have a \\"Getting there & Away\\" section that tells you the best way to get there -- and even includes the bus or train schedules you'll need. This book doesn't skim over the top -- it has more information about Tamil Nadu than another book we bought specifically for that area!<br /><br />This is the first travel book I've ever seen that lists courses that are available that might be of interest to travelers while traveling.  For example, in the Chennai section, there are listings for a Tamil language course, and one on a local type of hand-painted textiles.  The index lists all the courses for easy reference. There are cooking courses in 12 different regions of the country!  There's also a section on volunteering and traveling with children.<br /><br />I'm an armchair traveler to India now, but I hope to go there soon and this book is giving me lots of ideas!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted! I end up playing every chance I get.  Now it is on kindle too and I like it better since the screen is bigger.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Much of what the author spoke of resonated with me. I may not have the same issues exactly but the surrounding context applies just the same. After reading this book I have much more confidence to reach for what I want and say so.
B008JFUR10|5.0|If only Guillermo could have re-imagined Transformers instead of Bay.<br /><br />That said if you grew up watching Power Rangers, Voltron, G-Force/Battle of the Planets, Gojira/ Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera, Robotech, any Gundam series, Macross, Gunbuster, Bubblegum Crisis, Neon Genesis Evangelion etc etc etc<br /><br />this is a FUN movie for you.<br /><br />be warned: many cried and moaned about the long dialog scenes and what not BUT when it is time to fight?  It was worth the dialog. About that, for this being a movie with a green screen, CGI Mecha and Monsters the acting is better than you would expect.<br /><br />I want a prequel, either a CGI TV series or movie.<br /><br />Great Flick !!!
0847842134|5.0|I have wanted this book ever since I first came across it in the mid 90's but could never afford it, I had to settle for buying a few individual pages on eBay.  I was so thrilled when I learned it was being reprinted that I preordered it immediately and have not been disappointed.  The quality is incredible, pages are thick, textured paper (just like earlier editions), illustrations are clear & colorful (a million times better than the online scans I've seen). I'm also happy to see many more illustrations than the ones generally shown, I will certainly spend a lot of time looking at this book.  The only improvement I might suggest would be the addition of a slipcase to protect the book. For now I'm just keeping it in the Amazon box until I clear a safe and easily accessible space for it on a bookshelf (not easy since it is a very large book!)<br /><br />Worth every penny, although obviously not for everyone; my family doesn't share in my excitement, but I figure that's a good thing as now I don't have to worry about them messing with it!
B00G32QIEG|2.0|I like Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges but the movie reminded me of Men In Black but just a little different. It was just meh, nothing overly exciting. I really don't have too much to say about this movie. I'm glad it was short.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|On my Kindle Fire the game occasionally lags and sometimes freezes and wont unfreeze and i have to force my device to shut down because it wont unfreeze, otherwise its a very addicting game and i love it

B0067R0APK|4.0|I like this APP.  It works great most of the time.  Sometimes it does not update like it's supposed to do.
B000002H38|5.0|This is basic raw music.  Anita Baker is one the best pop/jazz singers.  I was happy to add this collection songs to my music vault.
B00AN0KBJC|1.0|The last 2 outta three episodes I have purchased have been so broken, I stop watching.  Very tedious to have the show start and stop constantly. Does not work well everytime, but in the past the quality of streaming.download was 100 times better.  No change on my part!

B0079R8KXG|5.0|Gave this to a grandson for the Kindle he got as a Birthday gift. He had ask for a red one and this worked just great. Very happy with it.
B00BAXFAJC|2.0|I am still trying to decide whether or not to devote several more hours and several hundred more pages to finishing this book.  Using my Kindle, it isn't always easy to look back and try to put the puzzle pieces back in place.  Maybe my $10+ would have been better spent on a more enjoyable read.  The writing style is brilliant, but I would prefer the Cliff Notes version.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|My son told me about this movie and said I would like it. Bought it and watched it. Very good show.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I can't say I loved this book but it was very well written and very thought provoking.  The story of Alice's decent into early onset Alzheimer's was troubling to read for me as I am nearing her age and found myself wondering about my every struggle to remember a word or name. When I first read the title, I thought of the use of the term &#34;still&#34; to mean the lack of movement.  When it finally hit me near the end of the book (I can be a bit slow to pick up on things!) that the title referred to how she still remained Alice as the disease progressed, it almost made me cry.  I did like how it was told from Alice's perspective as opposed to an outsider's perspective, which I think really illustrated how cruel this disease is. Worth reading.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|My daughter showed me this game on her Kindle and told me to try it. I bought it for my Kindle and have had lots of fun working it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|loved it, but read after I had finished Me Before You and I loved that one so much more that this one seemed to be falling short on something (not quite sure what). Moreover, if you have children, that might be a little too overwhelming to read... I even had nightmares about it...
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has created a world where you can get lost and entangled in the web he has woven. Exciting, well thought out, properly delivered.  All along you question how all these characters fit into the puzzle he has created for you to piece together.

You might call it a modern King Arthur and Knights of the Round Table, but that would be too limiting, too restrictive.  His sweep is much broader than any one kingdom, any one person.  He does philosophize along the way, but it doesn't overwhelm ; it simply invites you to ponder and question if you choose.  Thank you for a marvelous read.

B003PIUC02|5.0|This is one of the best premium channel TV shows I have every watched. I takes everything you think you know about Rome and turns it up to eleven with a more historic twist. Think Rome was a violent land of debauchery run by a super elitist class that use anything and everyone to gain power? Well you are completely right and this is the most entertaining way to see that up close. Is it 100% accurate of course not. That is why historical fiction was invented, but there is a lot of history between the lines.<br /><br />This is something you need to own if you like action, drama, moving pictures, or just want to know what it feels like to own pure awesome.
B00EUS6FR0|5.0|A whole slew of new tunes done ala Pink Martini. They just keep delivering time after time after time. Love it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I found it even more intriguing than book 1. Suspenseful. Full of character depth and a must read if you liked book 1!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great movie over all.  All actors seemed to have leading parts, instead of focusing only on the main actor.  I would recommend it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Always loved his writing.  This is equal to all his great books.  Good to know what happened to Danny after The Shining.  Great read.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|This was the first animated 3D movie that I had ever seen and it far exceeded my expectations in both the quality of the animation and 3D as well as the plot itself. The storyline itself makes the movie worth watching but the acting (voice) cast and the other aspects of the movie add to make this an excellent choice. The adults enjoyed the movie almost as much as the children did.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fun reading, cute story.  Well written, held my interest.  Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a slightly risque romance that's also fun

B007SGM084|5.0|This book captivated me from the moment I started to read it!  My friend recommended it to me & now I recommend this book to anyone that likes romance novels!
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|I thought it was really well done and engaging. I felt, however, that the whole movie was a clever preachment concerning progressive ideals and the youth over the older generation. I think these are potentially dangerous ideals to instill without balance.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|First, my favorite AFI album is probably December Underground. Burials doesn't really compare to it but it has a few songs to relate to. The main song I can relate to would be \\"I hope you Suffer\\". I relate on two levels: former friend and former boyfriend. Davey pretty much says in that song what I had been thinking. The feel of the album is strong. I wouldn't say it's the best album yet but it's not horrible either. I give it five stars because I'll always be an AFI fan for life and have been since 2003. If you like the older stuff, this may not be to your liking and I would suggest listening to the songs online first somewhere like sound cloud before buying and maybe download songs you like from the album.<br /><br />Me though, I only buy AFI and not download. I do that because I listen to CDs when I go to sleep. But again, if you like their older sound/music then this new album may not be for you.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I resisted reading 'Lean In' because I am what Sandberg describes as one of the 'first generation women' who does not consider herself a feminist and wants to be judged on merit alone. This has worked rather well for me over my 30 year career as an attorney.  So, when it became clear to me that because of all the chatter about the book that I would need to read it in order to understand her perspective and be able to participate in the chatter, I did. It is very easy to read--short, concise chapters, each of which makes a point well. Sandberg highlights both 'internal' and 'external' 'barriers' that she believes women still face in the rise to the top, and identifies an 'ambition gap' between women and men. She ponders why this gap exists but doesn't definitively answer it.<br /><br />Upon reflection, I agree with most of Sandberg's observations---but I'm afraid I disagree strongly with her couching them as 'women's issues'. First, I believe they are gender neutral 'leadership' issues that need to be addressed in a gender neutral way; Second, I believe most men will, as I did, roll their eyes at yet another push by women for special treatment. I think Sandberg must find a way to get her discussion into the realm of men, otherwise no change will happen. And while I believe that women, once at the top as Sandberg is, can effect change, they cannot get there by whining about unfair treatment along the way--they must get there using the current rules and THEN work to equalize.<br /><br />Regardless of where you fall on these issues, the book is certainly worth a read as it frames where the women's movement is today and how far women have to go--which I think is a surprise to most.

B009X2CVXA|4.0|This is the second book I have read by Kate Morton, 'The Secret Keeper' was the first.  'The Shifting Fog' is written in much the same way, from the point of view of changing from the past to the present - in flashbacks.  The story is set in Edwardian England and is about an aristocratic family who owned Riverton House.  The story is about love, tragedy and secrets - for both the family and the staff - and told by the last remaining member of staff who at the age of 98, weaves the threads of the past and present together.  I won't give away any more about the story, suffice to say I enjoyed this novel very much and would recommend it as a very good read.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|Good book to get some basic inspiring details in a starter's head! Would recommend this quick read to anyone interested in business.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Super tactic and strategic game for 2 or 4 persons. 3 player version not so funny. Great challenge for brain and geometric skills.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|Feel good story about a cat who helped change someones life.  I'm glad it all worked out so well for both of them.
B00ET7EON4|5.0|Arctic Monkeys make solid albums. From start to finish they keep it interesting and find new ways to bend and test the bounds of their sound. This is another example of that. It sounds completely like the band, and yet not like any other release of theirs. Here they are more beat driven and have a smooth sound that bops more then it pulverizes guitars, but it never sounds like they are growing old or tired or God forbid the dreaded &#34;mature&#34;. Instead they are taking the themes and ideas they have explored since their first album and coming at them from new angles, finding twists, and alleyways not yet taken. It makes for a fascinating listen and is full of earcandy that will roll around your head for days. It proves once again that this is a band built to last. True artists, but always fun as well. Rock n Roll doesn't get much better then this.

B000002VCQ|5.0|It was a good opening album  for a relatively unknown singer at the time. This replaced my original lost album!
0345803493|5.0|Loved the 3 books and during the last book I couldn't put it down. Very good, suspenseful and exiting! I would highly recommend it to other readers. I hope they make a movie sometime in the near future.
0345803485|5.0|I loved the book and thought the author did a wonderful job with the story. I liked it because, although controversial and graphic, it portrayed a real story that explains why some people are the way they are due childhood circumstances. I liked the way Grey changed by putting his true love first as well as Anastasia understanding her true love and accepting his past while helping to turn his life around. Very cool
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! So glad it's on the Kindle now,  I have been waiting for a long time for it to be available.

0316204366|2.0|As compared to some of Gladwell's other writings, this item strikes me as rather anecdotal. The dozen or so people he highlights made personal strides because of confrontations/challenges/problems encountered early in life and it made them stronger persons (or at least the fight made them fighters. The problem is that Gladwell focuses on what Gladwell wants to focus on - those numberless people who encountered on problem or another and failed - well we are not writing about them.<br />A disappointing book.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I have chosen this book for book club discussion.  Loved finding actual pictures on the Internet of the train and children to show at our meeting.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|it wasnt AS EASY TO INSTALL AS I was led to believe.  it wouldnt install using a 3 yr old computer.  and now that its installed i cant figure out how to use it with the computer.  The little icon is not at the right hand top corner of the computer screens.  If i hadnt waited so long to try installing it i would return it.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|(Played on Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot;)<br />The game has excellent graphics.  There are problems with placing and selecting items from time to time; in reading other reviews, I think that problem occurs on different devices.  The characters do talk a little more than I wish, but I like having the audio dialogue as a variant in an otherwise mostly graphical game. The facial movements of the characters as they speak is quite repetitious and somewhat jerky; I think less movement would be better; more would make the game slower and require too much memory.  I would rate the game itself 5 Stars except for the annoyances I have listed; given their existence, I rate it 4 Stars.  I add a 5th Star because I think the price is nicely low, considering the game's length, excellent graphics, and variety of hidden objects and different types of puzzles.  Only one puzzle (repairing the garden path) seemed to be unsolvable on my device.  I exited, closed the app, and opened it again.  When I began again,  at the beginning of the chapter, I proceeded through the puzzle without a hitch.

B00005JKHP|2.0|I'm one of those rare Star Trek fans who actually likes the first movie.  I like the long special effects shots set to atmospheric music, similar to the ones in 2001 A Space Odyssey.  I can completely understand how that overlong sequence showing the newly redesigned Enterprise in the finishing stages of construction was meant as a sort of love-letter to the fans of the TV show.  I find the long shots of the V'ger cloud and ship interesting, considering they were done in the days before CGI.  So this review is not coming from the \\"it sucks because it's so long and slow-moving\\" camp.<br /><br />I don't think I ever saw the original theatrical version of the film, but back in the early 90s Paramount put out a boxed set of VHS tapes of the (at the time) five Star Trek movies.  The version of ST:TMP that was included in that box was a \\"Special Longer Version\\" (SLV), which included extra dialog and crew scenes added for the first TV broadcast, probably in response to criticism that the movie had too many long special effects shots and not enough plot.  That's the version of the movie that I grew up with, and what I'm comparing the Director's Cut to.  Unfortunately the SLV is out of print and not likely to ever be re-released.<br /><br />The reviews I've read for the Director's Cut were mostly in agreement that this was a far superior version of the movie - the film makers pulled a George Lucas and went back and spiffed up a lot of the special effects that they didn't have the time, money or technology to complete on the original film.  And the director re-edited the film in response to the criticism that it was too long, too boring and focused too much on those seemingly endless special effects sequences.  Sounded promising, so I bought it.<br /><br />Like the \\"new and improved\\" special effects that had been added to Star Wars, the upgrades here don't really improve the movie, and in some cases detract from it or look out of place.  The DVD set includes the original scenes as a bonus feature - compare the scenes where the Enterprise finally gets to V'ger.  In the original movie, the ship drifts up to some sort of cobblestone looking structure that surrounds V'ger and the crew takes an elevator up to the surface of the hull then walks out onto the stones.  In the new version, the ship stops some distance from V'ger and then a CGI crew just sort of appears on the hull and a walkway magically forms out of glowing bits for them to walk on.  To accomodate this change, they had to remove the cobblestones from the viewscreen in a previous scene, and the result looks really bad.  I don't see how that improved anything.  The commentary and special features point out that the \\"magically appearing walkway\\" was in the original storyboards, they just didn't have the time or money to finish filming it.  But what they ended up with made MUCH MORE SENSE, so why change it?  Why would the crew even go out on the hull of the ship if there was no apparent way to get to V'ger from there?<br /><br />Another example is when V'ger sends its first probe to the Enterprise, just after Kirk and crew finish the flyover of V'ger's massive ship.  In the original movie, it's pretty clear the probe is approaching the Enterprise from the back, which makes sense since the ship just flew past V'ger.  In the Director's Cut, a new CGI shot was added of the probe approaching from the front of the Enterprise, meaning the ship must have just made an instantaneous 180 turn that we didn't see.<br /><br />But my biggest gripe is that, ironically, there's a ton of dialog and human interest bits edited out.  I thought the whole point was to try to \\"balance\\" things and focus more on the crew than the special effects.  The changes do just the opposite.  There are some bits of Shatner that were probably removed because they were considered \\"over acting\\", but the result is that Kirk comes off in the director's cut as a bit of an unemotional robot who's barely connected to the plot.  Just weird little things like editing out his \\"Oh my god\\" line during the transporter accident scene (easily one of the creepiest things ever in a Star Trek movie).  What was the thinking there?<br /><br />The Decker-Ilia romance is downplayed a bit too, and Sulu's obvious infatuation with Ilia is completely edited out.  Gone is Uhura being so disturbed by footage of V'ger destroying the monitoring station that Kirk has to tell her twice to turn off the viewer.  Gone is Decker's assertion that, like man, V'ger created God in his own image.  Lots of weird, unnecessary little trims like that.<br /><br />Another way they attempted to spiff up the movie was by changing the audio.  It might be my imagination, but it seems like they removed some of the incidental music from the soundtrack, and they definitely removed a lot of the (admittedly dated-sounding) computer voices and warning sirens.  For example, when the Ilia-probe first appears, in the original movie there's a computer voice giving the intruder's temperature and location, which made it clearer that this wasn't Ilia, it was something that V'ger had sent to the ship.  That's completely gone in the Director's Cut, for no apparent reason.  What I really didn't like though is that they played with the dynamics so much that half the time the dialog is barely audible, and when you turn up the volume to hear it you're suddenly hit with a super-loud noise like the destruction of the asteroid in the wormhole scene or even the Ilia-probe smashing her way out of sick bay.  This isn't a horror movie guys, you don't have to make the audience jump.<br /><br />Sadly they took a movie that I really liked, which approximated what the original TV series might have been like with a bigger budget, and turned it into the boring movie that everyone has been saying it was since it first came out.  It still has its charms and Star Trek fans will still enjoy spending time with the well-known characters and ship.  It's also, by far,the most science-fictiony entry in the Trek movie catalog - not just a comedy or action movie or political analogy set in space.  I just wish they would have taken the \\"Special Longer Version\\", cleaned up its special effects (without replacing things just for the sake of replacing them with CGI) and maybe trimmed a few minutes of the longer effects sequences, and left it at that.  Hopefully someday that SLV version will be re-released on a better quality format than pan-and-scan VHS tape.
B00006690G|4.0|The eminem show CD is perfect but the case was cracked when we received it but over all good condition!
B00973DDN2|3.0|Still a good album, but this one just doesn't seem to get as much play time as their previous albums.  Guess I'll have to give a few more listens to see if it can gain some play time.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I must by saying I am a John Grisham fan and have most of his books and wait impatiently for the next one to be released ! Sycamore Row was not a disappointment and I could not stop reading until it was finished. I enjoy Jake and his family and the hardships they go through in the practice of law with his sidekicks thrown in for just enough light reading in the mist of a very hard lined story! I found this book so very well written with so much history and understanding of how times have changed but still remain the same. I must say that would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. In this book you have everything thrown in..Relationships, hardships, Lawyers,Law, Judges,hopes and dreams mixed with sadness , fear and the pursuit of Justice!
B00915G6MG|5.0|Best show on TV. I have all the dvd's... Love the show  The actors are great and you get drawn in each week....

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I started reading this book as soon as I downloaded it. This man went through a lot. The story starts with his training right through to what happened overseas. To live through that is amazing. One little tiny dig against the book: The ending seemed too quick. He was so thorough through the whole book, I expected more of the ending story.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great sequel to one of my favorite movies. This would easily be adaptable for TV on the big screen.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|My book club read this book, recommended by a member who is a 5th grade teacher.  While I read it, my 5th grade daughter read it too ( much quicker than I).  It was a lovely book about compassion, kindness and how cool both these attributes can be.  My daughter came to the book club meeting, at the insistence of all the other members and was able to give us her insight into much of this WONDERful books contents.  Highly recommended reading for your 5th grader and up.  Great reminder to parents too, in our busy lives, about some important issues.

0091954673|4.0|Much more of a manifesto than a radical how to guide than 37signals previous books, I was a bit disappointed. As a remote worker myself, I didn't find much that was new and/or didn't fit into the common sense category. I guess that's reassuring in a way and perhaps this is a topic for which there's not much to say.<br /><br />If you are an aspiring remote worker, or a manager of an aspiring remote worker, this is well worth picking up as a quick 101 guide although you could probably work out most of it yourself. I'd also say that the recommendations of software/services are unlikely to satisfy bosses at anything other than small enterprises (document sharing, for example = Dropbox/SkyDrive or Google Docs).<br /><br />Already a remote worker? There's not much to see here unfortunately, but it's an engaging read.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|... it would be World War Z.<br /><br />Never mind the book.  That's as much as I will mention about the book.  The last thing I want is to be painted as some 'World War Z purist' whose mad that its not the book.  The book is mediocre and preachy, so forget about it, I don't care that movie is not the book.<br /><br />World War Z the MOVIE is awful in every way that mindless blockbuster movies can be awful.  Nonsensical story, nonsensical plot, nonsensical and impossible actions by characters... all beginning and concluding in a nonsensical amount of time.<br /><br />I'm not against big over the top action films.  I enjoy things like Marvel movies and Star Wars and Pirates of the Carribbean, but sometimes a big disaster-porn film is just so over-the-top stupid.<br /><br />How anyone could ever compare this waste of time to proper zombie movies like Romero's Dead films (Even the remakes) or Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later is beyond me.  How The Walking Dead can be the #1 cable TV show on right now and people can still watch this film and say its good with a straight face is mind-numbing.<br /><br />World War Z is to zombie films like One Direction is to Rock N Roll.
B005JLN9OO|5.0|If there is any justice in this world, Feist will be remembered not for her early dabbling in poppish Apple Commercial tunes, but for this album, hopefully a turning point. Her guitar sounds are as rich and raw as Neil Youngs'. It all blends in with the Happiness Project. The whole album goes together beautifully. Recommend it on Vinyl for sure.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|My boyfriend and I both love this movie! He isn't in to the Wizard of Oz like I am but this movie became a family favorite. Great actors, beautiful colors and overall good story. I hope they come up with a sequel to it!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I wasn't sure about the plan to split up the story, but it ended up working quite well. I loved being able to sit in the story with Harry, Ron and Hermione as they searched for the Horcruxes and figured out their relationships.
B00FJU1HLC|1.0|Pure indoctrination of evoloution theory and Humanism and not even a very good story line unless you like father bashing.
B00271DNP4|4.0|3rd book was my favorite, but the movie didn't quite meet my expectations.  I felt the movie didn't drop as many clues/build up as much anticipation to the big reveal at the end like the book did. But, still think the movies are fun!
B0090SI44M|5.0|I saw this movie with my oldest child when it was at the movies years ago.  It never gets old.  A really good movie for all ages.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|We love all the books and movies.  This is probably one of my favorites, even though there are quite a few departures from the book. Great movie!
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|It was a very poignant story showing with a message to have faith and never give up . Very inspiring.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I'm a new convert to Mr Sanderson's writings. I have to say I've been sucked in and I want to read everything he has written. This is the 6th book I've read of his in half as many months and I just can't get enough. This book was fantastic. Mr Sanderson has created a universe that is incredibly unique and exciting. His writing style is very descriptive without rambling, and every detail contributes to the story. I hate that I have to wait another 6 months for book 2, but I'll survive by reading his other fantastic side projects.<br /><br />I would highly recommend The Way of Kings to any fantasy fan who is looking for a creative world filled with ideas and people who won't be found in any other fantasy series.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I found this easy to use, and helpful in group conversation settings.  Good amplification.  Easy to use and very portable.
B007NYPWS6|2.0|Not a bad idea but indeed it is a theatre play not necessary good for cinema. Acting is great but conversations often sound artificial, along with the transitions in characters' tone. Result is a mediocre, often boring movie.
B0091W7K6K|5.0|Timeless movie that takes you back to an exciting time if you lived through it or discovered it retroactively. And of course it is classic Steve McQueen with a strong supporting cast, how can you go wrong?
B001QVFDA4|5.0|Seriously, this is almost as good as Snatch. Better than Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels. Can't wait until the sequel. (If Ritchie ever comes through.)
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|I uploaded this while at a conference/business trip to ease my note taking and I love it!!  Very easy to use (especially with a stylus pen) and I love the fact that I can email my notes to myself...no need to carry a notepad anymore!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Watch every year and never quits being funny. I laugh before the funny part gets there cause I know what's coming.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|You could consider this a rip off of Twin Peaks (remember that?) and the science is poor. It's not even that well written but I found it to be completely absorbing. Arguably mediocre but strangely addictive. I'm looking forward to number 3.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I became an instant fan of Lee Child's, &#34;Jack Reacher&#34;.  The story line and plot were captivating and gripping.  I enjoyed every minute of this thriller.  Just enough romance to keep it interesting and still not make it a romance novel, that my wife loves.  Reacher is a man that most men wish they were ... and then some.  I will read more of Lee's books as they are entertaining, take me away and captivate my interest ... and that is what I read books for.
B005SLS3VY|4.0|Michael Connelly is a master and I've enjoyed every book of his that I have read. This one is no exception. Another great book from Connelly. Recommended reading.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Through extensive research, this author brings to light the enormity of the divide, and the clandestine antics, behind public opinion before Pearl Harbor.  The propaganda and smear campaigns were elaborate, and have all but been lost as an integral part of our history, due to the united front the US had during the war itself.  The author tries hard to be fair with both sides.  The down side of that is that it is so thoroughly descriptive of numerous players that I found it tedious trying to keep everyone straight and place them in the puzzle, I got lost in their mini biographies.  But the respect for honesty and research in history is apparent here.
B005SLS3ZU|4.0|Michael Connelly is a master and I've enjoyed every book of his that I have read. This one is no exception. Another great book from Connelly. Recommended reading.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing Candy Crush. It is very Challenging. Just when I think some of the levels cannot be passed without cheating, I pass them! I have been on some levels a long time but I love a good challenge!
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Michael Connelly is a master and I've enjoyed every book of his that I have read. This one is no exception. Another great book from Connelly. Recommended reading.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I had such high expectations for this book but it just fell flat and was almost a chore to get through. It feels like Roth sold out now that she has been dubbed the \\"next hunger games\\". Such a wasted opportunity to show case her talent.
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|After looking at The Great Gatsby 2013, I had to look at the version I remembered, to compare.  The 2013 version wins hands down.  I had to laugh at the 1974 version.  No sex and no dirty words.  Boy, movies have come a long way.  Gatsby's house in 1974, looked like a shack.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This solitaire game is great and keeps you trying to better yourself in finishing the game in times to beat previous game times.
B004IPPINW|5.0|Superb!  Articulate, insightful.  A stark look in the mirror, a wake up call to American idealism.  How Americans look to an outsider.
B000GOUMPI|5.0|Woot woot! The Indians were murdered. So spiffy Kubrick. You are are amazing. And so were the Indians. Thanks to the both of you for giving the best to build upon. :-*** so says a libated review.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This app was easy to figure out, and a lifesaver as I really wanted to be able to highlight and annotate pdfs without having to sit at my computer. Exactly what I was looking for - and exactly what I was expecting.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I feel Candy crush is a game that consumes you! I gave it a 4 star because I find that when I sit down at night and try to relax, I wind up playing until I DIE! ugh!  lol  Great Game
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|So satisfied with this song! Can't wait to play this song at my wedding. John Legend is one of my favorite artists!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|the game keep u forcast which is very good for the mind, and I am telling lot of people about the game, plus lot of people play it on the train so somebody u what level u on which is good. be bless have a great day
B000QCTNIW|5.0|The reader will be amazed and delighted with the wonderful, fresh information contained in this book. For example: Who would've thought that you could recover from a stroke as easily as described in this book. Who would've thought phantom limb pain could be dealt with by the use of a mirror because the brain loves changing.  Every chapter brings thrilling new strategies based on actual clinical successes. If you or a loved one has an issue that stems from neurological sources, this is a book you must read.
B00A9X7X6C|5.0|Even though there are a few holes in the film. The move does a great job looking at time travel.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this to keep upto date with the weather Wonderful I love it very much it is very wonderful
B00867GKIK|5.0|Age 54<br />Was one of the best family movies I've ever seen ! Great story ! Great graffics.<br /> Saw the movie a long time ago with my son and enjoyed it, then watched it again once I received it and was amazed at how much more I enjoyed it the second time !<br /> Would recommend for the whole family !<br />  Features were pretty good ! It was impressive how they thought up and created the scenery !
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Sleepwalker's Journey is an amazing app game. There's really nothing to complain about with this one:<br />Beautiful graphics, great music, the levels start easy and get tougher. Object of the game is to get to bed while collecting all the stars and moons, but watch out for falls and bumps. You play against a clock. You earn ribbons upon completing stages- (1) a gold ribbon if you beat the clock AND earn all stars/moons, (2) A silver or bronze ribbon if you don't beat the clock, or you if don't get all stars/moons. If you make a mistake you can roll back to correct your mistake, and if you want to speed walk you can do that too, (without interrupting game play). It's perfect.
B0012GMUI6|4.0|I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan and an even bigger Clapton fan so I thought let's give it a go.  If you don't like concept albums you may want to skip this one.  I think the music itself has some of the best arrangements.  I was disappointed Clapton doesn't get much spotlight, but you hear his playing here and there.  I've been listening to it for two weeks straight and it took probably 3 times through to grow on me.  It has some very pretty parts, some good rock parts, and those distinct PF traits that give it a floating through a dream feel.  Overall it's a great addition to the collection and if you like Pink Floyd you're gonna find something to like about this album.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Beautifully written..........the author takes you on an emotional journey that so few books can.  Touching, sad, and inspiring. Loved it.
1401917232|5.0|Gary has continued unfolding his reincarnation and even projecting it into two additional lifes.  in this process, he has continued expanding and expressing  A Course In Miracles with its emphasis on Forgiveness.  Highly recommend the Teachers Manual be reviewed (Is reincarnation real?) to help bridge this apparent contradiction.  Also, highly recommend a study group based on A Course In Miracles Workbook Lessons be done to provide a more comprehensive take on Forgiveness.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Wonderful read, well written from a man who experienced an amazing step of faith in the existence of heaven and God.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Previous version worked great loved it.  This update freezes my android platforms.  It doesn't even open.  I hate it and so does my son.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I found the relationships among the presidents fascinating and<br />learned things I did not know even though I have lived through<br />most of these president's terms.  A good read for anyone and<br />especially those who want or need to know how politics works<br />in the good old USA.
B003WUYQSW|4.0|Nothing really revealing, but solid and not overcomplicating. Few intersting siggestions, some very personal and subjective comment by Gary and really nice reading
0307476073|5.0|Got a recommendation from a friend and Im really enjoying her writing style! Its a quick read and completely entertaining!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a very popular and fun game  since I got this game I was in love with it and could never let go this is one of the best games that every one can enjoy so please please get this game
B0007LGCB8|4.0|These sandals fit well and feel sturdy. Plan to use them for walking about town and for wet wading when fly fishing.
1451666179|5.0|I love Allie. I love her website. I love her drawings. I love her stories. They make me laugh so hard I cry. This book was highly anticipated by me for the MOAR STORIES! And having some of the most popular from the blog is great too as then it's even easier to share them with people in real-life. Buy this book to support her and then read it to support yourself because laughter.<br /><br />tl;dr ALL THE POSITIVE THINGS!<br /><br />THANKS ALLIE I LOVE YOU YOU DID AWESOME. I. AM. IN. AWE. OF YOU!
B000G6R7B8|1.0|Had to return these watch, as it would need keep time and I did not purchase it to be a bracelet. Amazon handled the return smoothly.
B001IF277K|5.0|The product worked just as i thought it would and i will be ordering more in the future. I would recommend it to anyone.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|All of the movies that I have ordered were memories of my youth, or other memories.  Movies that I enjoyed when they were &#34;new&#34;!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|We viewed the CD with friends who also saw &#34;Midnight In Paris&#34; in theaters.  They enjoyed it more the second time and had a much better understanding of the story.  Taking the CD with us on our family Thanksgiving visit.
0061122416|5.0|Amazing true to life story! A must read for everyone! A good read is hard to come by....not anymore with The Alchemist!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is awesome, but you lose precious time waiting for the hits to tally, i.e. awesome, sweet, delicious, etc.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|its the new tetris good for all age groups i can play it all day and not get bored thanks
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My 5 year old is obsessed with angry birds and this one is a little more challenging but he loves it and he plays it all the time.
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Lot's of layers to these movies, much more subdued that most murder mysteries. Beautiful scenery, good story and I just enjoy the mood
B000O8OTNC|4.0|The piece 'as I saw it on the site. It was just what I wanted! The package was really safe from bumps! I'm really glad I bought it with you.
B0094MFITS|4.0|I really like all of these movies. If your going watch them try to see them in order. That's not that easy to do because it's not clearly marked on all of them. But these movies have a mood allowing you to get to know the characters. But if your looking for action movies this is not it.
B004DSX5B6|3.0|Due to the low price, the quality is just satisfied. But it does not match the fame of Gerber as I see it. Overall it is good.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|This tour is amazing, if you love Madonna from the 80'sshe brings it.  She covers all different songs and keeps it very entertaining!
B00122OCQI|5.0|This album is near perfect. &#34;Violator&#34; is perfect. Get them both.<br />This music will get in your brain and you won't grow tired of it. I haven't after 30+ years!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I like the app but the camera is hard to move and there's no flashlight on night mode so it's a 4/5 but it's fun
B00E9P959O|5.0|I remember the anticipation waiting for this release after the long 5 or so year hiatus the band took due to the unfortunate events that took place in Neil Peart's life. For me the original just landed like a dud on my ears. I remember a few strong melodies and songs but much of it just sounded like garbled noise. I played it a few times but after that it rarely made it to my CD player. Eventually I picked up the RUSH in RIO DVD and discovered for the first time the songs from Vapor Trails, they sounded so much more defined and musical live. They were my favorite songs from that CD/DVD. I had not heard about the \\"bad mastering\\" controversy with the original CD until I read a Geddy Lee interview recently. I am glad they remixed this CD because all of the songs are really improved. You can hear well defined instruments, singing and the song's seem more fully developed and distinctive from each other. It doesn't take several listens to appreciate the improvement...it is immediately noticeable to anyone who has a familiarity with the original.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Handsome knights, lovely young maidens, despicable kings, a clever dwarf, ghouls and dragons... plus Sean Bean! Pay close attention to characters actions and dialog there are plot twists around every corner.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game and it is a nice, educational game for kids, teens, or even adults. I am a 13 year old and I must admit that I love the movie Nemo, ever since I was little (about three). Me and my dad are huge Nemo fans and cannot wait for Dory (Nemo sequel) ... anyways, back to the topic... It is extreamly educational, there were plants and creatures I haven't even seen or know exist! (Like the time I got stung by something that was a white pink,  no stingers (except the &quot;feet&quot;), and floats. It left three sting marks BUT did not hurt as bad as a normal jelly).
B004PGO25O|5.0|This little book wields a powerful punch... and occasionally that is what we need to<br />get off dead center.... Highly recommend to anyone facing the impossible and looking to<br />realize their goals and dreams.
076115678X|5.0|I've already adopted many of her recommendations and am really impressed with how my hair looks and feels.  I was getting compliments the very first day!<br />I am definitely letting all my &#34;Curly Girl&#34;-friends and relatives know about this book.  It is past time to embrace our hair as something special and wonderful.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Their most addicting awesome game ever!! I love it!! And I also love that I can play it anywhere, anytime, on any of my devices!
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Great family film. A little cartoonish violence but, nothing too extreme. Very small children might br frightened of Sloth at first.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I am not able to complete level 3-1 I keep on losing lives when it first begins...I need help :(
0316017930|2.0|If you look up his 10,000 hour data, he definitely hand-picked what he chose and what he ignored.<br /><br />There are many instances of people never rising to the expert level with over 25,000 hours of practice, as well as experts that did it in 3,000.  Nearly everything is on a normal distribution, except for Galdwell's magical 10,000 hour claim.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Addicting fun game! Can't get enough of it. It's very challenging on most levels too! My favourite thing to do on my lunch break. Download this game!
B004GJYRA0|5.0|I've always loved this movie so i had to buy it! I would recommend it to be added to any collection.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We are loving this, it is so convenient to watch and control Netflix (and Youtube) from the table or couch.  We have an adaptor that plugs in and streams whatever is showing on the phone but then you have to get up to do anything with the phone and the adaptor is specific for your phone where Chromecast works with any device connected to the same WiFi network.  Also, very, very nice that you can use your device (phone or tablet) for anything else you want while streaming, talk on the phone, play games while my son is watching a movie, etc.  I look forward to being able to stream more than Netflix and Youtube (we do not have Hulu and do not use Google Movies) but for now we are using this daily and love it.  Highly recommended for $35!
1451668945|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said before about Mary Higgins Clark's novels.  They consume the reader which is just makes for great reading.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really love this game and would recommend it to anyone &lt;3 it's really worth the $1.99. it's very fun and challenging.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|After a painfully long absense the Muppets are back and just as good as you remember them! This new film manages to recapture the energy and humor of the classic characters and give a few new ones as well. The songs are undoubtedly the highlight, but the jokes from start to finish are spot on and the whole film just feels right. Perfect for young kids and even better for grown fans.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|....is so fun it is like candy crush. ilove this game I want me a little minion for Christmas. hshshshsj hshshs shy hshsh shah
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|This game is really fun. Which is not common&hellip;AT ALL. And it is really easy to play!!! And plus, u can play it on a computer so if it's not working on ur kindle,u can play it there! How common is that!? The only reason I'm giving the game 4 stars is that it's 99 cents but besides that I recommend sugar sugar.<br /><br />Chloe recommend dat game!!! ( ;
B001AP11L6|5.0|Everything went well. Good quality, shipping, delivery on time and of course GREAT music from jack white! You will never regret purchasing anything by this artist!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Stuck on Level 191 for over a week. Still loving the game, though!! Glad it's finally available for my Kindle Fire HD.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This game is a hit for my son. he can't seem to put it down when we are in the car and just really loves to play it. It is not too hard, but still challenging enough that he feels successful when playing the game.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is awesome! This game has great graphics and different kinds of racing events. This game is WORTH IT!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Wonderful classic spider solitaire. Without all the irritating stuff that gets in the way of some other games. Try it. You'll like it.
B00DUCXFUC|4.0|Beautifully packaged and presented, this is just a well put together box featuring the complete &#34;Dark Knight&#34; trilogy in one dense package. The artwork has been seen before, and the most of the bonus features are mostly rehashes of previously released material. Still it's a treat for the Bat-fan who wants all the films and special features in one place. The die-cast models of the vehicles in the Batman's arsenal are a nice touch too.
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|The DeLorean was fun to put together. It took about an hour to do so. I wish they had a ultimate collectors edition version though because it is kinda small.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|This is the first, full, un-adulterated recording of Madonna live! The MDNA tour isn't by any stretch the best show the Queen of Pop has ever taken on the road, but if there has been an event that has defined her career up to this point, this particular tour does that nicely. Featuring mostly tracks from her most current album, it still features some of her contemporary greatest hits. This is a masterfully arranged live album edit that fans will enjoy! If you couldn't get a ticket for the sold out event this is your chance!
0307950689|5.0|we love this book, as well as Dan Brown's other works.  This book is keeping us in suspense.  Love it!
0307010856|5.0|A classic. Got this because I had such find memories of it when I was a kids. My kids loved it and could wait to find out what happened on the next page!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Makes my device run faster and smoother. It works so good I'm surprised it's free. My device was starting to freeze up slot before I tried this.
0345803485|2.0|But the writing  was not good at  all.<br />I thought her writing skills were awful.<br />Same phrases over & over & over.<br />Lost interest.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love the site, has something for just about everyone, easy to navigate, great ideas, great recipes, crafts, photos, clothes and on and on  I think everyone needs to Pinterest.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It was a first rate page turner from beginning to end.  Action and suspense the entire book.  I love the character Jack Reacher.
