B001OSIV62|5.0|The movie was just great.  I thought that the black and white portions were well done. I thought the movie was great.
B003NTMREM|4.0|Wish I had known that entire series is in DTS 5.1 AUDIO but not on Amazon downstreaming video, Look for and buy the compleat TORCHWOOD Series in Blu Ray box set. Found for under 70.00 , Yes this is brand new never open and in Blu Ray, all the EXTRAS.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|It started so slowly that I thought I was going to hate it, but it was an extraordinarily satisfying examination of love discovered. Rediscovered, perhaps, but certainly love triumphant.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was incredible. It felt real throughout. It was descriptive, well written, and I couldn't put it down. Dark humour, heart wrenching, and a great read.
B005K17RU0|4.0|great weather application.  I do not know what I would do with out it.  the radar is the best I have ever seen.
B009G41CG2|2.0|The instructions say you can match the flowers and the seasons even though they are not exact, but it doesn't work.  The tiles don't disappear.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|My family loved this movie! Of course you have to be in the mood for a serious  movie night, but as long as you are prepared for that you will enjoy it. Our daughter gained some historical perspective from this movie that I believe made it more interesting to her.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not really as good as all the hype. So so. Not a fan of the ending, eh. Fine for a quick read.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome graphics, clues and surprises! I love it and have yet to finish. I hope there will be more like it. There are no games out there with this level of challenge and class. It's intriguing and the music and sounds add to the mystique.
B00CBRADU2|4.0|I enjoy this type of movie and even though some of the acting was hilarious, if you enjoy people & cars blowing up on the big screen, you'll like this on your living room tv screen.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|very good action and Tom Cruise was very convincing in the role kept you guessing asto what was going on
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is not your run of the mill game. You need to pay attention and think. Had a lot of fun and will defiantly buy the next game. Only down fall is game is to short.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Watched with my teenage daughter. She liked it enough to go get the book!  Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author and I always enjoy his movies.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I wasn't completely sure about this book when I bought it but I was hooked by a circus of dreams. I enjoyed reading every page and sighed when it ended. I hope the author continues to write and that all her books are this good.
B000I186FW|5.0|Great movie all the way around.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|ok movie - well filmed But of course the ending fits title - Impossible. Probably should have been named Yeah Right Freaking Impossible
1449437524|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK!!! It sits next to my computer monitor on my office desk now. A must for anyone who has a dog!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Cornwell is one of the most reliable authors I've read. Always a good story. Always great interactions among her band of characters that have been together for twenty years solving crimes. Always some new and interesting technology revealed and explained. I love everything she writes, but especially the Kay Scarpetta stories.  Great story!
B004UHL9EK|4.0|You can set up multiple reminders and timers,  works well without locking up.  I would recommend this app to any one that is interested.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Hey it's Disney and Pixar so you know it's going to be fun for both you and the kids and with Disneyland opening up the new Cars section it's worth getting.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I am perhaps one of the few people in the world never to have read J K Rowlings Harry Potter books.<br />The Casual Vacancy was entertaining, funny at times, and a good read.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I got the Bose sounddock original (type A or 1st. generation) after tried some products like 30 pins to lightning and Bluetooth device but none of them work on my Bose sounddock. It's gave me a big headache to find a method to play music from my Iphone 5 through my Bose sounddock, but when I search on Amazon and found this device I placed an order and it's take less than 3 days to receive it, not bad. Now I can listen music from my Iphone 5 and my computer. Now my headache is go away, because I love to listen music in the morning and on the Sunday morning with a cup of coffee. The price is little bit high for a small piece of cable, but it work for me. Who ever have a Bose sounddock like my type go ahead buy it if you don't care about the price. It's work greats!!
B002MGNNFY|5.0|Trying to confine this film to a plot summary does it a disservice...  This is a movie for someone who wants to see a truly independent film.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The first Shrek is very funny and you should get it.  After that they just keep going downhill so enjoy this one then walk away and don't look back.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great story with some seriously unexpected curves ahead!  A beautiful and perfect wife goes missing and the cad of a husband is left behind to solve the mystery.  Both characters change so much that the mystery keeps you guessing until the end.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Love the characters in this series. As you watch you can identify with various characters. British acting at it's best.
B005HEPS6A|4.0|I like this series because it emphasizes intelligent and moral actions in the face of crisis. Plus it's sci-fi, so bonus. I was surprised that it kept my seven-year-old's attention but I like watching it with him. It stimulates thought-provoking conversation. Of course, this series is from the early 90s, so some things seem dated...but not as much as you might think.
0790729377|5.0|This is just an all out great classic that everyone should own.  Tennessee Williams plays are so well written that they are truly timeless then through in Marlon Brando and Vivien leigh and you cant go wrong!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|If you enjoy a challenge of trying to solve a puzzle then this is the game for you.  I really enjoyed playing this mystery game.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Well, if you are wanting a feel-good story, this is not it.<br />I cannot comprehend the entire scope of the life of Jesus. The ability to not do what He did, but chose to follow through for me is overwhelming. The cinematography certainly depicts man's beastiality, stupidity and hatred.<br />The movie is worth watching multiple times just to catch a glimpse of Jesus' love for you and me.<br />Amazing grace and compassion in a ruthless world.<br />Well done!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game and I love it end I was able to get it for free because of the free 500amazon coins
140053271X|2.0|I bought this to replace a Sony PRS-300 that I thought was too heavy and too slow in the page turning.  Yes, the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but I am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter.  I am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - I've yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions.  Why aren't nooks plug and play?  That's my first big problem.  I have no problem with my Sony and the library book I wanted is now on my Sony.  The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.  It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.  The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.<br />**UPDATE 5/25/13**  I finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming; I finally found help online.  I have yet to discover a way to comfortably hold this book in my left hand and turn the page.  This was a very bad buy for me.  I bought a book-style cover for it and that was a waste of money as well as I find the cover just gets in the way.  I did not know how good I had it with the Sony PRS-300 and will continue to use my Sony instead of the nook.  I don't recommend the nook at all.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|While it falls short of the exact music from the Jazz Age, Jay Z's collaboration with Baz Lurhmann make this wondrous soundtrack simply amazing! The hip- hop/pop/dance music we listen to today and how popular and well- known it is is what the Flappers and Dandies would think of the Jazz music back in the 20's. Most people believe this soundtrack to be \\"pure crap\\", but the musical stylings of Lana Del Rey, Florence + The Machines, and others are what makes this soundtrack so likable. Some songs I didn't like as much as the others (Together- The xx) and some songs I listen to over and over and over again (A Little Party Never Killed Nobody (All We Got)- Fergie + Goon Rock + Q Tip). It is a love it or hate it experience that can only be heard through the ears. Mixing fast, upbeat, party jams with slow, sad, and emotional songs is just the perfect ratio. I recommend going to see the movie, read the book, and ,of course, buy the soundtrack today!
B00AB2NYNC|4.0|Very creative music. Love the flair and excitement that the banjo brings to the group.<br />Commentary is also good to see.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I spent about 2 full hours fiddling with this game. It was fun and a bit challenging but not frustrating at all. I would recommend this to pass a boring wait somewhere because you won't even notice the time pass.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This DVD is great. It allows us to know more about Lincoln and the struggles he faced during his life and presidency. It is well acted and the scenes are well filmed.<br />I would recommend that everyone see it.<br /><br />Diane Wilson
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I needed to adjust the location of songs and photos that downloaded to my kindle when I got the Window Media Player 11 loaded into my home computer and hooked it up. Works good.
B0055MBQOM|2.0|I bought it to syncronize two identical monitors (Dell supersharp U2412M) plugged on the same computer (DVI and VGA port). After calibrating them multiple times with the ColorMunki, they still had different tints. They ended up worst than I had done visually.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|This a great book, and loved the movie. Highly recommended, great way to spend a boring train trip. Bravo Lee CHILD.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This DVD is great. It has great acting, beautiful scenes and tells the book's story in a great way. I would recommend that others buy it.<br /><br />Diane Wilson
193700788X|5.0|I am too excited to read this the final book in the Sookie Stakhouse Series.  I am going to be sad though, cause I have enjoyed reading this series.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Waste of money. I am so disappointed in this book. The others were about Sookie and the vamps this had nothing to do with them. What a horrible ending.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This a great game for all ages! Love this game:) good clean game love the colors and the nemo characters of course. Will deffinetly reccomend this game to my friends:) great job on creating this.
B00C7GZ19U|5.0|This DVD, a bottle of champange and a picnic in the park or country side.  What could be better? Sweet, easy listening music. Love it.
B009R659L8|5.0|A real page turner. This one was Really a mystery, but typical MHC. Who would have guessed the ending? Well, you really can't with her novels.
B008I43DYU|3.0|Very helpful for most problems. I'm not very good at math so need all the help I can get.would recommend to anyone.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|great product. I love Amazonbasics products. They are very durable and handy.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|A little predictable and slow.  Not the best adventure, but still enjoyable.  I'm glad I've seen it, but not likely to watch it several times.
B007V65R54|4.0|This is an interesting book that demonstrates how statistics have application to many areas of life; from baseball to elections. Nate explains how he was able to call the recent elections with such accuracy. Almost no math; just common sense.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|One of the best photo editing apps I've ever used. Not only very intuitive, but also able to save your photos in different qualities.
B00846REIS|5.0|One of those hard to put down books stayed up tooo late at night reading it.  Cant wait for the next one
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Good pace, solid characters, and a good action packed adventure.  I'll watch it again.  It made me want to see the heroes in their own films.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I don't know who I disliked the most; the protagonist or the villan. Formulaic; no plot twist,  much too long, don't bother.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I have rave reviews for the graphics. And the puzzles were fun with enough challenge to make you think. But I beat this game in less than 5hours with2 small children running amok and putting dinner on the table! I just feel that there should be more than 3 chapters to the game.
B007DIQC90|5.0|OMOM was a discovery I made before they became famous in America. I cant even put into words how great this album is. For people who like mumford & sons, Philip Phillips, Lumineers, etc. Great music, love their accents as they sing.
0780626478|4.0|A funny and enjoyable film.  I'll watch it again and it seems like one of those films that will be referred to often
B006LSZECO|5.0|I like a book that keeps me guessing.  This one sure did!  Just when I thought I had everything figured out...
B000S1LUE6|5.0|Easy to read with great insight into relationships. I would definitely recommend this book to my friends to read. It also makes you realize a lot about yourself
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Good intro to who the Doctor is. Pretty fast paced. (Every Doctor has his own pace) Acting and effects aren't out of this world, but that's part of the charm of the show.  Does a good job of pulling you in and helping you believe that this world does exist, and that all things are possible.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Strong characters that played well together. It was amazingly funny, adventure filled and yet had a touch of romance.  Love it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book helped me understand people who live in constant danger and yet stay at peace.  What priceless  lessons in faith and commitment.  Don't miss this book
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Funny at times, you will cry and it made me sad they couldn't get it right without the chaos of splitting up. There is a happily ever after or is it?
B003EV6DBW|5.0|The triumph of romance and intellect over cynersism and brute force,  a classic show that has inspired for nearly half a century.
B0097K21YW|4.0|I found this addictive, and different enough from angry birds that it will hold my interest for a while longer.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Great Alblum.  Their music is something else.  The lyrics always have a message and they do a great job of telling their  stories
B008M4OYYY|3.0|IT WAS OKAY. IT COULD HAVE MORE OF THE PYRAMIDS. MAYBE MAKE A DELUXE KIT OF THIS ONE. EASY TO PUT TOGETHER.
B008C0C1Y8|5.0|Don't expect Citizen Cane, this is a fun film for action fans with a love of one liner stereo types and shallow plots so I loved it.
1878424319|5.0|Forget counceling, this book can really help you with just the day to day reminders to keep your head straight.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I play this game everyday.  It's the game I play to begin my day, the game I play at the end of the day.  Love it!
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I ENJOYED PUTTING THE SHUTTLE TOGETHER. I LIKE HOW IT CAN BE SET IN DIFFERENT SET UPS. IT WAS A GOOD BUY.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is amazing, totally worth the dollar. The ability to play as Edward Page, the main antagonist, is great. If it had more levels, maybe a couple dozen challenge missions it would be perfect. The weapons are cool, all different than the other. Definitely worth it. Can't wait till MC5!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh - I finally read it. I couldn't put it down. The story captured me completely. One of the best books I've ever read...seriously. Thank you for telling stories. I can't wait for the next.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|This is a good movie. Will definitely watch more than once. Any Clint Eastwood fan will want to add to their collection.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Violent and dramatic, yet inspiring and humorous as well. Classic Tarantino with a nod to the Spaghetti Western I watched as a kid growing up, Truly a fantastic movie.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Good game, I like it, but the invisible wall is a downside. Its not never ending like I would have hoped.
098555780X|5.0|I really enjoy the pictures showing each step to these ties. Also appreciate the actual names of the braids I have been doing.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|This processor is one of the best processors in terms of performance per dollar on the market right now, with only a few of the other FX processors such as the FX-6300 being better in that regard.<br /><br />in terms of performance, this processor can be considered just below Intel's 3rd gen i5 processors for gaming on par or even ahead for other, more general usage tasks however, it is also at least $80 cheaper. at the same price point, it is approximately %10-20 better than intel's offerings.<br /><br />As of yet I have had absolutely no problems with this chip.<br /><br />In terms of overclocking, I have been able to get clocks of up to 4.1ghz with stalk cooler and no voltage change and have gone up to 4.5 with a small increase in voltage. with better cooling and more patience, even higher clocks could be achieved.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fast<br />good overclockability<br />cheap<br /><br />cons:<br />requires either dedicated GPU or GPU embeded in motherboard<br />limited quad channel ram support
1451695187|5.0|After a loss of my son I was recomeded this book by a Priest,and I think is great reading for a father with a great loss
1881273873|5.0|This book has taught me how to express my love and thoughtfulness to others. I thought I was doing that already.<br />Turns out we all feel loved in different ways. The way I was express love to others (siblings and friends) wasn't being received in that way. Once I read this book I was able to 'speak' their love language and received positive feed back for my efforts. Especially with my Sister, we have totally different love languages and speaking hers to her has made a huge difference in our relationship. It has also had an impact on my friends as well. Once you read the book you can easily pick out other people's love languages even if they haven't taken the quiz. It's a pretty cool and powerful tool. I highly recommend this book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoy it<br />.wish I had found it sooner. Just started it but can't wait to get to more levels<br />Gotta go my horse is calling.
B005L38QK2|5.0|I love the smooth feel and great performance of this mouse. Would highly recommend to any Diablo fan or any gamer in general.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I've seen this movie over five times and each time find a new detail to enjoy. A lot of effort was put into creating this movie  and it shows (in the dialogue, storyline, fight scenes). I love the attention to culture that just isn't in the original. The acting is great. My almost four year old son enjoys it more than watching the Avengers cartoon
B004DLPXAO|5.0|great portable reaading device for my smartphone & tablet doesnt miss a beat. Especially with the furthest page read sync you dont have to find your page everytime
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Too bad Fox pulled the plug on this one. Would love to see a few more seasons. The movie is great as well. Bring it back!
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|Not one of Barbara's best by far.  Story line is kind of stupid.....not a favorite.  Wouldn't suggest it to anyone I know.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I loved the book Matched which was the first in the trilogy.  I read the book in a day as I could not put it down and when I finished I immediately bought Crossed.  I was just as easily pulled into the sequel and wanted to keep reading, but the overall plot and story I did not enjoy nearly as much as the first.  But regardless, once you read Matched you need to continue with the series until you finish all three stories.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What a wonderfully thought provoking and inspiring book.  Incredible.  I honestly am floored by how positive she remained about life throughout her ordeal, and how the love of a daughter and mother can be so intense.  I like to think that somewhere out there, Jaycee is on a farm with her horses, taking care of dozens of stray animals, and being loved by dozens of kittens... especially checking off one by one the things on her list of what she wants to accomplish in life (be a best selling author and seeing the northern lights).  A must read, especially for those who need a little push, or hope in their lives.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The story really doesnt go anywhere for most of the book. The last quarter peps up a lot but mostly you just want the characters to say what they mean and get on with it.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I loved seeing these shows complete with the original commercials and great performances too.  I especially liked seeing the show in Miami. I also liked how they scheduled British performers around The Beatles.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is fun. I enjoy playing it. The game never has a dull moment in it. I will definetly reccommend it for everyone of all ages.
B00BY8DFRW|5.0|Not only is this an incredible album from Deep Purple, this would've been an incredible from ANY band. I pre-ordered this on vinyl back in March, but the label pushed it back two weeks from April 30 to May 14th. Well, me being the big DP fan I am, couldn't wait so I also bought the cd in the meantime.<br /><br />Let me just start out by saying that this might go down as Deep Purple's best produced/sounding album of their career. Getting Bob Ezrin to produce was a brilliant stroke of genius. I was amazed when I first popped the cd into my car, then my home system. I'm listening to my vinyl copy as I type this and have to say, it sounds even BETTER than the cd!<br /><br />We have (imo) the best collection of songs since their '96 release &#34;Purpendicular&#34; w/A Simple Song, Out of Hand, Above and Beyond (their tribute to the late, great Jon Lord and to whom this album is dedicated), Uncommon Man and Vincent Price (the new single; check out the great video on YouTube!) being the instant standout tracks. That's not to say the remaining 7 (8 tracks if you get the vinyl or deluxe edition cd) aren't good, just the opposite, they are good! Hell to Pay and All the Time in the World (split a-side single) are better as unedited album mixes than their shorter radio edits/mixes (which is usually the case anyway).<br /><br />I really can't recommend this album highly enough!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I kind of refuse to pay real money to get through it. But other than that it's a cute game a little more instruction would be nice. If you just want a simple game that is nice to look at I highly recommend this app.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Just started watching this year - catching up.  guest stars awesome. however too many contrived time constraints in courtroom scenes. Eli is great!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|GREAT READ IT KNOW<br />BEST BOOK IN A WHILE WELL ACTUALLY THE BEST BOOK IVE EVER READ FULL OF ACTION AND ADVENTURE
B002IDDRT8|5.0|Good scify flick with warrior crash landing to earth in the period of the Vikings..  His wanting to stay with the Vikings when he had a chance to return to his own people from the unknown planet he came from.
1780891261|5.0|love it!! its so sensual and romantic, every girls dream put on words. definitelty worth the time, energy an money spent on it!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Double Outstanding  the best JJ had to offer I loved it check out Michael Giacchinos score too Go See it
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I watch every single episode of Castle of tv and this is a great book to read because you can picture the characters and what's going on in your head
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Some have complained about how technical this book got at times.  Personally, I reveled in those descriptions, although I'm certainly not a scientist.<br /><br />As a bit of a wise-ass, myself, I loved the main character's sense of humor.  I'll probably buy the paper copy of this when it comes out, as well, as I'm still a sucker for having a physical library.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This was a long book but I found I was addicted to it and read it all the way through.  There were many twists and turns and the occasional big surprise as main characters are disposed of in nasty ways.  I have come to grips with the unusual use of the language the author uses é.g \\"ser for sir\\".  I have become so hooked that I have brought the next in the series so I can continue to follow the lives of the main characters and I am hoping for a happy climax.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|A true classic that everyone must read. Happy, sad, pensive, fun. I enjoyed it bunches. Was life really like this back then?
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|it is a very good game and is very simple to play and learn. it is not hard at all to me.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|3rd season was great and really upped up the ante for the story. The tension between Peter and Olivia gets ramped up as well. There are a few interesting twists and turns that keep you coming back. The &#34;special&#34; episode is awesome as well 'as usual'. The last few episodes were great but at points had me scratching my head. Not totally a bad thing, but without going into specifics it was a bit jarring at times.<br /><br />Just watch it!
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I'm a long time Star Trek fan, so just by virtue of the long history of fandom, I naturally like any new Star Trek movies that come out.  This one was good fun to watch, young Spock/ old Spock, seeing young Kirk, etc.  I would have enjoyed it a bit more if there had been a more substantial plot and a few less gratuitous fight scenes, but I guess that's what showcases the special effects best and make the most money!  I would probably watch it again just to see if I had missed any of the inside jokes on the first viewing.  This movie would definitely be best appreciated by someone who is familiar with the original Star Trek series, as there are a lot of references back to those characters and events, naturally.
B0016492BW|5.0|only thing missing is 'dentist' film from the opening.audio makes u feel u are there.almost all scenes are very crisp.love the outtakes.anyone know why they took out intro fim?
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a pretty accurate app. I love it! I think I use this app more than watching the news. I would recommend this app for anyone and everyone. It's fantastic, tells you what days you would feel most comfortable going outside, you get to set the temperatures, wind, reason, clouds, even fog....if you want notifications for your best days.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|She liked it so much she wants to see the movie really bad now.  I hope the movie lives up to the book.
B002NN5F7A|1.0|This movie was not at all what I thought it might be.  It was too long and the plot was not good.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Good movie, action packed. Classical movie good to pass the time with it. Not a typical brainwashing type Hollywood movie.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cord was just what I needed to recharge my kindle .perfectly as a replacement for the original cable that came with my Kindle.
B007ZZKWHY|4.0|It's all kind of far out, but it's well done with some really nice effects watching it on a large TV.  Not really for everyone, but it's actually quite well done, better than I expected.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Sister really loves it & has watched @ least 2 times since getting!  I got it for her for Christmas.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Having kids that make messes and a dust buster that died after 10 second of being turned on...this is a WONDERFUL invention!
B009AMANH4|4.0|The product was received on time and was what I expected. I will recommend it to any others that desire to purchase it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. plenty of digits for larger numbers. Nice big buttons and large display. Wouldn't change a thing on it.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain explained things I've known intuitively about Introversion versus Extroversion.  Susan Cain did thorough research on this topic.  The book was fascinating, well written, and easy to read.  A page turner I couldn't lay down.

B006X08FDA|5.0|We heard this band in concert several years ago and fell is love with the band. Mixed between Louisiana crawfish, Dixieland, and Carolina Mountain Music, they will make<br />you fall in love for more.  Each musican is unique in each of the instruments they<br />play which makes an enjoyable CD.

0307744434|4.0|The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is about an unusual circus that opens at nightfall and closes at dawn.  This is not your ordinary circus.  Instead of a red white striped big top, you'll find everything is either black or white.  Instead of one giant tent, there are many tents, each with unique and amazing acts or interactive displays you're not likely to find at the Ringling Brothers.  There is the ice garden, an enchanting place with sparkling frozen trees and blossoms. There's a labyrinth with a bizarre network of rooms: stacks of suitcases, floating feathers, an albino sphinx, and snow. There's a tent with a sign that states \\"Please enter cautiously and feel free to open what is closed.\\"  Inside jars and bottles in all shapes and sizes line a table. They contain sensations, sounds, and evoke images. But the spectacular circus itself is just a sideshow to the main storyline.  Two men make a wager.  They each train a protégé to become the greatest magician of all time.  Marco and Celia spend a lifetime learning their trade, each taught in contrasting styles. They know they are in a competition, but they don't know the rules or the prize.  It's all mysterious.  What enfolds is an intriguing tale of imagination and surrealism, which was mostly well received with my book club. Criticism of the book included that it was slow at times and could be a tad confusing, especially with regards to Celia's father's condition and even the ending. Most of us agreed that it is not a book we might have chosen to read on our own, but turned out to be intriguing.  Read other reviews at http://readinginthegarden.blogspot.com

030746363X|5.0|Great Book! The information provided in the book was very well researched and written. Interesting and factual, a view on a new perspective to weight loss!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Worth the money I paid for it! Very entertaining! Keeps your mind working and constantly thinking. Good workout and freeway for puzzle solving skills!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Love this story of such simple earthy folks from a by gone time.  First was drawn to the series when I saw that Brendan Coyle as an actor in it. (Love him in Downton Abbey)
1423136802|5.0|My cousin loved these books and wants the rest of the series.  If you are into mythology with a modern twist buy these books.  You  won't be disappointed.

B000VZYPB4|5.0|I love this show and have watched it since the beginning. The only thing is that $30.00 is a little to high for me. I purchased the First season on sale for $11.00.  I will watch and wait until season 2 goes on sale.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|The characters are amazing.  The writing is amazing- they have you caring about a drug dealing, robbing biker gang.  Believable no- enjoyable- every minute
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A very fun and addicting game.  Basically match 3 with some strategy so you can get pieces of an object to then bottom of the board.  After you go around the map once and &quot;complete&quot; the game, you can just keep going around forever but they add stones that can't be matched up to make it more difficult.  The background music is also very nice and I love the map screen song, if  you stay on it, you can hear the whole thing.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I could not put it down and I never want it to end- as soon and it did I picked up the next.
B00746O3X8|4.0|I though it would be good to carry my camera while hiking. I converted it to carry the on my chest to strap to my back pack and I don't see a much better way to carry a dlsr while wearing a heavy pack. It's also cool that you can strap the side holster to your belt. It feels fun to have your camera down there like a 6 shooter you are going to quick draw. The down side? You look like a dork while wearing it, just like the picture suggests. But most importantly there aren't any pocket's on the thing. It would nice to have a little place to stow the trigger for my flash, an extra battery or maybe another filter or two.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|These books are crazy.  So many characters they are hard to follow.  You feel like you are in their world.  So imaginative.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this game is awesome!! I love it. it is not hard to level up and has pretty good graphics. totally worth the money. you get to save people from thugs and even a car accident. (no blood at all) BEST GAME EVER. if you like spiderman you will love this game:)
B0011I9L8W|5.0|This classic is a classic for a reason.  Wilde's take on human nature through the painting speaks volumes on vanity and self absorption.  If you have not read it do so.
B00418NVMQ|5.0|This album precedes A Strange Case Of.... and I'm glad it does.  Halestorm was a solid METAL band on par with Skid Row or Motley Crue.  Their latest album is too poppy, too mainstream.  This album captures their talent.  I love a band that can do it live as well as on record.  I would prefer Arjay tone it back a bit.  Okay, you're a GREAT drummer.  Roger.  Got it.  It's not all about you. You're in a BAND.  There are OTHER people on stage, too.  Still, they put on a great show.  Lzzy is great at audience interaction.  I like how she steps back into the shadows and lets Joe take the spotlight during his solos.  She has a rip-roaring voice.  I hope she can keep it up.  I'd hate to see her flame out and wreck her pipes in the manner of Bret Michaels.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read it because everyone else did.  Terrible writing, terrible plot, terrible kinky sexy.  I can't not believe people went wild over this book.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|SPOILERS<br />I was a huge fan of Star Blazers when I was a kid.  After the treatment of Transformers and the decline of Spiderman, I was uneasy about this film. I'm happy to have been proven wrong.  The effects are top notch.  There's only the slightest bit of shaky-cam, just on the top edge of my own personal limit.  I could have done without Analyzer, but he's disposed of quite neatly.  The film has threads of sacrifice and honor that make me want to beat my chest an shout, &#34;GOD BLESS AMER.... uhhhh.... BANZ.... ummmm... GO STARBLAZERS!!!!!&#34;  One of the pilots sacrifices himself and, as his ship is crashing, he salutes and holds the salute until his ship explodes.  Brings tears to this old soldier's eyes. It gets a bit hokey, but that's par for the course in many Japanese films.  That part doesn't last long and is nicely bracketed by KA-PEW KA-PEWKA-PEW laser fights.  The real-life characters mirror the animated ones nicely.  Meisa Kuroki is ROCKIN'!!!  If you're a fan of Starblazers, this film does it no harm at all.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The HBO show is great but start with the books.  There is so much details.  Your mind runs wild.  Read them all.

B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I love all her works, but this seemed to be a little more humorous. Puts a new slant on Ivan.
0679809015|5.0|My 8 month old daughter loves this book! Not only is it fun for her to find the hidden animals, but it's also apparently tasty to chew on! :)
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|After the first two books I was expecting another exciting adventure, but I was dissatisfied finding characters not living up the personalities that had been developed. I felt like the end left me wanting more but without any hope. A few chapters from this one could have been added to Catching Fire and left the reader either wondering on a lasting cliff hanger or satisfied with the characters they had come to love. [...]
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I'm a huge Start Trek fan.  Seen every movie.  Watched every episode of every series, even the bad ones.  This is, in my opinion, the best of the Start Trek movies.  Great characters, great writing, great acting, great action, great story, great CG.  Excellent movie.

B004W1GCQO|5.0|The start of the show is slow and you begin to question whether you want to invest much time in this show...don't give up! It gets better and with season one so short you'll move quickly to season 2. Keep at it!
B001JU4S44|5.0|Action packed, fun for the whole family. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Tom Cruise does an excellent job in this movie. A real classic!

B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I have loved all the Diner Dash, etcI've gauninstalledon the PC, and was excited to get this.  However, there are 2 glaring issues with this that I just can't pI'm  up with:<br /><br />1. IAPs in a paid app - Just Say No! I will never condone this behavior!<br /><br />2. Broken UI - If your hand accidentally hits the back button in the middle of playing a level, it immediately quits the level--no prompting, and more importantly, no saving of your progress so you have to start the level over.<br /><br />This is the first PlayFirst game I've uninstalled before completing it.  I gave up on level 3 of the first restaurant.  Glad this was a FAOTD so I'm not out any money.
B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|Yeah, he's David Bowie. He made some good music. Very spotty after Ziggy Stardust a million years ago. This latest stuff is excrement. If this was anybody other than Bowie it would be treated exactly as is deserved. Freakin' garbage.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Great game. I  enjoy playing this game when I have a free minutes ago spare or when  I'm just relaxing at home.
0374214913|1.0|I bought this based on all the good reviews. Also, the subject matter seemed mysterious and intriguing. That did not last long.  It turns very quickly into a glorification of all things techy.  It is not really a novel, it is more of an obsessive fan's look into the world of Google.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|Schleich dinosaurs are always of high quality, they're very sturdy and realistic (probably). They also have a waxy or rubbery finish that is really good for getting a grip on, especially for tiny hands. This T-Rex is especially amazing. The movable jaw is strong, not flimsy like most toys these days. It's a good size and has great detail. The jaw seems to open to just the right size to fit other dino's heads in. If you're considering a toy for a little one who sincerely loves dinosaurs, look no further. This one is pricey, but it's worth it. I won't lie, I played with it for about 30 minutes before I wrapped it.
B003FXCSNQ|4.0|There's a little bit of hardboiled detective drama in this retro-futuristic (when read today) sci-fi novel, complete with bounty hunters seeking out murderous androids who are hiding out among the humans almost undetected in the post-apocalyptic radioactive dust-strewn and largely abandoned streets of San Francisco. Most human populations have fled to colonies in outer space; one of the popular destinations being Mars, which reflected in metafictive fashion the preoccupation with space travel at the time of the novel's publication in 1968.<br /><br />The narrative centres round one such bounty hunter Rick Deckard, who is assigned to 'retire' the remaining six escaped Nexus-6 (read: new improved intelligence) models, when his senior colleague is incapacitated after destroying two of the original eight. Running parallel to Deckard's story is a 'special' human, Isidore, one of the remaining humans who cannot leave for the colonies because of his genetically-damaged status. Both men encounter the androids, and become attracted to two identical models, but their reactions are markedly different, and through their respective actions, the question of what makes a being distinctly human is raised. Empathy, a trait that the humans bank on as a distinguishing feature between them and the androids, is strangely dependent on simulators called \\"empathy boxes\\". Their obsession with owning animals too, has less to do with the sobering knowledge that most species have become extinct due to the devastating effects of World War Terminus, but more to do with their value as status symbols. Synthetic animals are available for those who fight to keep up the appearance, one of the owners being Deckard himself.<br /><br />What makes this novel such a landmark work is probably the way it imagines a future that the world is/was already moving toward; automation, artificial intelligence, the threat of nuclear war, extinction, and spiritual consumerism. What is slightly out of date is perhapsthe overtly sexist attitude to women, even as Deckard agonises about his contrary feelings to one of the female androids. Isidore, too, when he considers that perhaps a female android is unable to cook, has an unconsciously patronising thought: \\"She'll probably want to, once I show her how; as near as I can make out, most women, even young ones like her, like to cook: it's an instinct\\". Reason enough to get shot with a laser beam, genetically-damaged or otherwise.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|During my first viewing some months ago, I was impressed from a staging, acting and general cinematographic standpoint. On my second viewing tonight, however, the full impact of this excellent film came home to me. Although familiar with President Lincoln's struggles with often contradictory moral and legal forces from other historical readings, this film presented a dramatization of Lincoln's dilemmas and personal angst that I'd never fully appreciated. It's a must see for those fascinated by the history of our republic in those extraordinarily difficult times.
0307165485|5.0|I had this book growing up and I would study the pictures and words for hours, again, bought for my stepson
1451697686|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and cannot say enough good things about it. It was easy to read, relateable and had a lot of \\"how-to's\\". Bea described her own process and her voluntary simplistic lifestyle. Even those who do not want to be a minimalist, this book encourages an individualistic approach to each room/ part of your life and how to get closer to zero waste. The process is truly about commitment and her own experiences have helped me through some of the growing pains and hardships with change. Love love love this book and her blog. If she writes another, you better believe I am pre-ordering that book!! Also....the Kindle version is awesome. She provides links throughout the book, which takes you directly to the websites. Awesome.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|If you saw the original Wrath of Kahn, well, you're kind of going to see it again.  I am amused at all of the great ratings for this movie which acknowledge the re-hash of the plot line but excuse it by saying \\"Hey, it's an alternate reality\\"!  I'm sure Ambrams loves you guys.  He gets to make a move that will garner him a ton of dollars and didn't even have to write a story!!  He just re-worked one that already existed.  And you're applauding him.  Hmmm.<br /><br />Actually, I didn't think that the  Wrath of Kahn was that great of a film.  And I like the new cast.  But I don't think that these people have a clear vision of where they are going with the franchise.  These movies are full of action but short on depth of character.  Lots of little tips of the hat to the original series - \\"Dammit man, I'm a doctor, not a...\\" - and it's always good to see Leonard Nimoy again. but I guess I don't see myself coming back for much more of this.<br /><br />If you liked the first one and dig lots of non-stop action, you'll love it.  Enjoy.
0545265355|5.0|I read the Hunger Games and I have to say it is one of the best novels ever. With it's endless excitement and suspense, it was really hard for me to put the books down. There were so many unexpected parts that had me flipping the pages back to re-read so I was able to believe what had just happened. I definitly recommend the Hunger Games trilogy for anyone who loves adventure with a romantic twist.
B000063UR1|5.0|But it was so Lonely and Isolated, That I got into the Idea of being Out in Deep Space, Drifting...Deeper and Deeper, Star Trek Voyager, The Starlost, Space 1999, That I would Always remember this Movie, its Emotion and Message!  The Relationship The Main Character Had with the Robots and His Need to Save Them and Nature!  I Felt like I had Left a Part of Me out in Deep Space With the Robots wandering The Universe!
B00CL68BK2|3.0|With all the positive reviews from critis and viewers alike, I thought maybe I missed something about this movie, but it was just ok. It was fine, but not a movie I'd watch again. It seemed too long and too short at the same time; some plots points could have used much more time while others were completely overblown. It seemed disjointed and if it was trying just a bit too hard. Good actors, but it just didn't click with me. I really enjoy Jennifer Lawrence, but she was an example of a character in the movie that just didn't ring true to me. I much prefer some of her other performances, such as in Winter's Bone.<br /><br />Surprisingly, my favorite actor in this movie was Chris Tucker. I really enjoyed his scenes. There was also one scene with Robert De Nero and Bradley Cooper when Robert was in Bradley's bedroom talking to him about not knowing how to help him now or in the past. Hand's down, the best scene in the film. Heartfelt without being overly dramatic or sentimental. But a couple of good scenes and performances don't carry this movie through in my opinion. The portrayal of mental illness was fine, but something about this movie seemed hollow to me.
B0011Z3DK2|5.0|Its Zeppelin, which is all great.  If you are not sure if you like Zeppelin, this is a great album with which to start.

B00632HWOG|3.0|I'm new to the Kindle and fumbling with it, but there does not seem to be a way to look at only the subject lines of the list of email messages, rather than have the application opening the first message. I don't want to open unwanted messages.

If you don't have it, you need it.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Just got it today. Quick and easy installation. Smoooooooth and precise mousing. So far it beats the Razer Imperator that I'm replacing. I use a gaming mouse for Photoshop and Premiere editing, so precision is key. The Razer was quite nice, but it kept freezing up on me. I'd have to reboot or plug in my vanilla optical mouse. $40 made the Anker worth a shot. It works great so far in Photoshop. Hopefully it won't freeze up on me.

0374533571|5.0|I work at a library and I read a lot of books.  I decided to read this when I saw the movie was coming out on DVD.  I LOVED it.  The characters were moving and I was so caught up in them. I actually read the book in 1 day and was sad when it was over.  I just watched the movie, and I was really disappointed that so many aspects of the book had been altered in the movie. It seemed like all the wonderful things about the book just weren't there.  The book does a much better job at conveying just how these characters evolve and become people you want to know more and more about.  It was a fantastic journey for me.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Well played start of the Hobbit / middle earth saga.  As the story progresses, you get drawn into the action and do not realize the end is approaching until it suddenly does end.  Really grabs your interest for the next of the series IF it is made.  Amazing to see characters from the original series showing up as younger persons that are the same actors.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a long time since a book has grabbed me like this one did.  I simply couldn't put it down.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Was browsing Kindle looking for a book when I came across this one. Having read the books from RA Salvatore, Margaret Weis and others, I am skeptical when a new Sci-Fi series hits. After  the first chapter, I knew this one was different. One of the best series in years, I finished #1 in a few hours and was hooked!!! This series is worth the read.
B00198X0WC|5.0|This is one of my favorite sci-fi movies, I love the photography, the effects and the acting. The scene of reviving  Lindsay is great, it always reaches my heart.

B001ANSSDC|3.0|Quite simply, the book is vastly superior to the movie.  I don't think that it is a spoiler to either to note that the book's characters are developed in far richer detail - including their struggles.<br /><br />While the book should NOT be treated like a psychological - or theological - text, I found it very interesting to read of Pat's Catholic background.  In my opinion, the book was NOT openly dismissive of  mere notion of marital reconciliation, as the movie struck me to be.  I would recommend to Pat that he next seek spiritual guidance at his local St. Joseph's in Collingswood.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|If you like action/suspense thrillers this movie is a good watch. I found myself locked in to this film and I was very pleased with the overall storyline. If you are thinking about watching Jack Reacher go for it. You will not be disappointed.
1574214276|4.0|This book was a bit more elementary than I expected.  It gave lots of patterns but not as many finished pieces with combinations if patterns or variations on the square.  It is a good book for starting out.
B004UID2LC|5.0|You can down load any music you like onto you kindle.  Any one song or album.  This app is good to have.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Finally. A fun game. You unlock new courses, new boats, win trophies, and even select a difficulty from 250 cc, 500 cc, and 1,000 cc. The controls are easy.<br />Move right to left: tilt the device<br />Stop: press bottom left screen<br />Go: press bottom right screen<br /><br />-even do flips and tricks in the air.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Exactly what our country needs to see today. The cast is amazing. The sets are superb. A must-see movie for any true-blooded American.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|This is such a cool CD. I just bought it and Nightfly, and both are available on Cloud before my CD gets here. I just LOVE this! I've had a bad hankerin' for this music for a while. I've not heard either before, but am a big Steely Dan fan from the '70s. This is making it all right for me!
B00936A0RU|5.0|I bought this movie for my collection.  I saw it at the theatre and my kids watched it online.  It is a must-have for DVD collectors.  Historical.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|Yes this app was a really good app and you should all buy it as a Christmas present for your cat or dog
B003ES61EE|5.0|I've purchased several lens pens over time.  Several were much more expensive and were in no way superior to this one.  I carry it in my shirt pocket when I'm taking pictures and use it frequently to remove dust, lint, etc.that lands on the lens.  Thanks Amazon.
B000SP1SEO|3.0|Snatch is action-packed and fast, but for my taste the mix of characters and plots was too packed and too fast.<br /><br />I found the dog to be more and more interesting, as the rest of the action and the plot became more and more involved.<br /><br />Gun fanciers may question whether the American Eagle .50 caliber pistol could really be fired one-handed with no apparent recoil, as shown near the end of the film.  Don`t try that at the local firing range.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Is this what mobile gaming is coming to? I might go get a psp if they are going to charge money to make every game more fun.
B0026ISUUQ|2.0|One scene near the end ruined this film for me: A troop of mounted raiders trot slowly into a village, in the open, carrying their AK-47s.<br /><br />The village goes into mad panic, everyone fleeing for the hills, or running to the U.N. cargo jet.<br /><br />You don't have to be a USMC-trained rifle expert (I am ... ) to know that one person with a 120-year-old bolt action rifle could pick off every one of them in offhand slow fire, and all head shots at that.<br /><br />The phrase \\"fish in a barrel\\" comes to mind.<br /><br />Instead of a 10 million dollar jet, one surplus obsolete rifle would have done more to protect that village.
193700788X|1.0|*SPOILER ALERT*<br />I usually don't write reviews, but I felt I had to say something, especially since this is a series I loved until now. Having that said, this has to be the worst ending to a series ever! I knew she was going in the direction of Sam from the last book, and quite frankly the last two before this one weren't great. It wasn't the ending I had hoped for, but that wasn't the biggest problem...that would be her underdevelopment of that aspect of the story and just ignoring issues of the past to get this ending she wanted. A big part of the problem for me is there never really was ANY chemistry between Sookie and Sam. That was made clear via the one sex scene in this book which seemed forced and weird. She says \\"yay\\" when he puts her on the bed (wth?) and he tells her \\"I'll ricochet you\\" when he's ready for round two?? What does that even mean?? It definitely wasn't steamy but sure was super awkward, even somewhat comical.<br /><br />I've noticed readers who liked the book think it was a great ending bc Sookie didn't want to be a vampire and I get that, but there was never any real development of the Sam relationship. Why spend all the time developing Eric and Sookie? Even when Sookie was with ALL her other love interests there was always chemistry with her and Eric. CH could have developed a loop hole in which she could live a long time/forever from the magic Niall gave her, or she could have figured some way to make Eric human since she completely changed his character anyway. Speaking of, she really tried too hard to make Eric unlikeable, especially by detracting from any act of kindness he made toward Sookie. She didn't HAVE to become a vampire in order to stay with Eric. I don't get how any fan of the series or any avid reader for that matter could respect this writing, let alone give this book 5 stars.<br /><br />I really feel like this was CH's way of showing us who controlled this story and these characters. I just cant believe she took it out on poor Eric who's one of the primary reasons this series has done so well giving CH fame and fortune. I would've respected this ending a lot more if she would have treated his character differently and developed this ending a while ago. Very disappointing, especially since the majority of this series was so good and well written. I have already cancelled my preorder for the \\"where are they now\\" book. I can't imagine giving CH anymore of my money unless she somehow rights this wrong in that book, which doesn't seem likely. I think the review \\"Notes from an entitled reader to the entitled author\\" sums things up nicely.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|really like this game! my granddaughter loves nemo<br />we play together when she stays with me we laugh a lot ! she just 3 yrs its a lot of fun for her!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Each episode, while building on previous stories, introduces new challenges and great surprise endings. Into second season and still no rehashing of old episodes or the writers being lazy and collaging just to put a show together.

In the summer of 1972 the line-up of Fripp together with Bill Bruford (late of YES), John Wetton (from FAMILY), Jamie Muir (veteran of the British free jazz scene) and relative newcomer David Cross was announced, although it was not until September, after first full band rehearsals, that the decision was taken to call the group KING CRIMSON.  By October the band was in Germany playing a handful of club dates and making a live in the studio recording that was (fortunately) filmed but for the most part never broadcast.

It was a legacy that was carried on by the quartet line-up both live and in subsequent studio recordings - with 1974's  'Red ' recorded by Bruford/Fripp/Wetton as a trio - and one that has resonated with, and influenced, generations of musicians over the ensuing forty years.

B00AEFXKOO|5.0|This movie is on my &#34;favorites&#34; list & I thought it couldn't be improved upon, but Blu-ray once again has delighted me with its clarity & definition. I am slowly replacing my whole movie collection w/Blu-rays, and this was on my &#34;top 10 list: It did not disappoint!
B005PK57IK|5.0|great show......great acting......wonderful performance by one and all. I highly recommend this show to any and all who consider them self a lawyer show fan.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|It does the job, but there are times when it crashes. But it does recover it for you, but it takes a bit to load when you really really need it. I would recommend having a larger mobile screen.

B004AKCME8|5.0|it's a beautiful movie of the owls taking hold in what they believe in and fairness to all........my grandchildren love this movie and grandma and grandpa too !  every child should see this movie.
B0041KVWI4|5.0|This was a gift for a big Beatles fan and he loved it. Thank you for a wonderful and affordable gift.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is fast paced, but the characterization also is fantastic. I like how the main characters sometimes are at a loss for what to do next and don't always have all the answers. What sets this book apart for me and places it above The Hunger Games is that the actions of the main characters have larger effects on their society as a whole. This is not a surface level book. One of the best books I've read and in my 50+ years, I've read a lot.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|This was an excellent gift for my friend. He is a true Beatles fan and this made it even better.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This version is more goal oriented like subway surfer but has the same temple run feeling.  There are carts and tunnels as well as a perilous path to run.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|OMG!?!  I don't know why they didn't include these scenes in the theatrical release!!!  Die-Hard fans of the books will just love the scenes played out here!!!  For any Twilight fan, this is a MUST-BUY!!  ;-)
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Great music never gets old and this movie has an awesome soundtrack of music from the 1950s and 1960s.  If you're too young to remember that music, watch this movie and be wowed.  I know people who currently are in high and college who are loving this &#34;old&#34; music.  Patrick has some great dance moves and Jennifer is ok.  While the story didn't grab me , the music and dancing makes this movie totally worth watching.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Huge fan of the Supernatural show series and love how I can see these any time and find things that I missed before!  LOL  Great collection to have/own or gift.  =)
B006M4F67A|5.0|Love these versions of Mahjong. Lots of different boards - hours of fun - and when you're stuck, there's a handy hint button.
193700788X|5.0|It didn't end the way I wanted, but it ended the way Charlaine Harris saw fit to end it. =)  It's bittersweet for me because it's an end of a series and my living vicariously through Sookie Stackhouse's adventures and encounters.  I just loved how she was so human about everything, even though she's Fae.  =)  Guess, TrueBlood the HBO series will have to tide me over till that ends and then I'll revisit my Sookie adventures at a later time.  PS If you're a true fan, you'll seeing folks from previous books.  ;-)
B002SAUCBC|4.0|An oldie but goodie! A great quick read from one of the most masterful writers in the modern American era.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|An incredible journal documenting the terrible truths of war in an era when you came face to face with the enemy.  We owe more than we can ever repay to these hero's who allow us to enjoy our freedom.  I will continue to pray every day for today's soldiers who are out there guarding me and those I love.

B000I9W08I|5.0|I grew up hearing these song never knowing from where they came. WOW! I was totally astounded! Absolutely power packed musical! It's funny and exciting and such a powerful energetic cast! I have watched it twice just to make sure I didn't miss anything. I watched the credits and to my amazement, the film had been directed by non other than a great dancer in musicals himself Gene Kelly! The beautiful Barbara Streisand at her best and Walter Matthau, ha ha, that man never changes! Also, Michael Crawford, his songs speaks volumes. I'm absolutely blown away with Hello Dolly!<br />Again, WOW WOW WOW!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This App is easy to navigate and looks great on my Kindle Fire.  I did not have any difficulty figuring it out.  It is very similar to using Facebook on my laptop.
1594745692|5.0|I dont think they would be great for first time tarot readers, but if you at least semi-know what you're doing, its fine... it comes with an instruction manual after all! I really do love this deck though. Really cute and great if you love zombies! and the readings don't HAVE to be zombie themed if you dont want them to be which is quite nice. Gives you some really cool spreads to try out too!
B007C7UZIG|3.0|I will update this when I have more time to mess around with the Steam App, but so far it seems a bit less than intuitive.  I have yet to figure out how to get to my favorite game.  It might just require more time to navigate than I have so far invested.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|WHEN I LOOKED AT THIS PICTURE. THIS WAS REALLY A LIFE LESSON IN IT . THIS PICTURE PROVE THAT NOBODY IS ABOVE MANY MISTAKES IN THIS LIFE. WE ALL GET THROWN OFF COURSE AT SOMETIMES IN A LIFE. WE THINK WE ARE DOING RIGHT AND WE NOT. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE CAN ALL LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES AND CONFESS  OF THEM AND LEARN FROM THEM AND TRY TO HELP OTHERS AND THE NEXT GENERATION AND MAYBE THEY WON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Great time waster. This is one of the most fun games I've ever played. And if you wanna do free play, that's awesomely fun too.
034580404X|5.0|A great read.  Rather blunt at times, but a very enjoyable series.  Would highly recommend them even to someone who is not particularly interested in romance books.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great story line. Great acting.  Great background. Kept me on the edge of my seat.  I just loved it all!
034580404X|5.0|My mother loved it for her Birthday. She liked the box set and the fact that it was 3 separate books instead of a bind-up. and it will look nice on any shelf.
0545265355|5.0|All the package is good, all of three books are great and in a perfect state. The hardcover is great, all of three books were perfectly printed. And the sending was on time. It's a perfect choise.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Good layout, and has enough variety to stay interesting.  Glad this one has a timer to make it more fun and challenging.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Honestly I've read this book four times and I still love it. Drama love blood... it's all there<br />Summer cares
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, but the book did a great job of painting the picture. It's a great read, very gripping. I'd read it again!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator is a handy root to have when you need one. I do not have one on my phone so this really helps when the need arises.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show. I love the complex characters, the writing, the scenery, the house. Even though I heard that this series was fantastic, I was reluctant to start watching. It just wasn't something I was ever in the mood to watch. One evening, my husband and I put the show on and from there we were hooked from the first episode. We crushed out the entire Season 1 in a night and morning. I wish I could give it another 5 stars. The second season is living up to the first and moving us into an extremely interesting time for Downton.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This is a game my granddaughter loves to play. It keeps her busy and out of trouble. Grandpa likes to plat it as well.
B0088W4YTK|4.0|I always enjoyed the original Stargate, and this show is just as good.  Season 3 is every bit as good as 1 and 2.

B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|But I love this album, every song is a a different sound and style as well as a new approach to some classic song structures. I love this album from beginning to end
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Relaxing fun awesome. Love the graphics. I got a lot a dragon's easy with the right combinations and the breeding guide. It really is a great game. Meant for who want money and the best of the best.

B00BI745AA|4.0|I am a huge fan of all things Les Mis. Because I am fighting an illness I was not able to see the movie in the theater and had to wait for it to be released in stores. I rented Les Mis to watch on my Kindle HD Fire. Overall I was happy, but some of the scenes where the lighting is darker  were hard to see.

B007THA4FI|5.0|This book starts off slow, but by the end you're invested in the characters.  It's rewarding if you stick with it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movie answers a lot of questions.  The first movie (Lord of the Rings) was a terrific story and full of adventure, etc.  But it completely left Bilbo out except as an old, confused Hobbit.  This movie gave him purpose and identity...and it presented Gandolph  from a place that wasn't just legend.  Get the movie if you want more adventure an answers.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Josh brings more writing and collaboration while keeping himself firmly grounded in his roots.  It's great to finally hear more of Josh's own works, especially with Brave.  This man's voice is incredible.  He demonstrates both power and control, with an intelligent sense for the dramatic at just the right moments.
0670026603|4.0|This was unexpectedly a great read.  Well developed characters, and a great story line.  Life is not a bed of roses.  The topic is not exactly one you seek out during your \\"what to read next\\" literary search but this was well worth it.  This extraordinary example gives you pause to think back of yourself -who was I before X, in what ways am I different now?  Well written, well received.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Ralph just wants to fit in, is that so much to ask.  Most movies that center around games don't have the heart or emotional depth of this movie. As an everyday antagonist in Fix-it-Felix, he wants the rest of the characters in his game to accept him.  When he gets rejected he sets off on a quest making friends, learning just how important his place in his world really is, and ends up revealing his heart of gold.  Ralph brings tearful smile to my face every time we watch it.
B0050QEYBK|5.0|This book must be what magic tastes like.<br /><br />I have owned Stardust for a long time but never picked it up out of my bookshelf. When I came to Poland, I decided to grab my smallest books to bring with me so I would have some hard copies to read (I do have my Kindle here), but they wouldn't take up much space/weigh down my suitcase. Stardust was one of those books.<br /><br />I don't know what I was expecting. I remember seeing the movie back when it came out and thinking it was cute, but not much more. This book is a fairy tale, plain and simple. It is fast-paced without too much character development. There is some, of course, but that's not the focus of the story. The focus is the adventures. The focus is the magic. It's written in fairy tale fashion and would be a perfect bed time story. Although I do have to admit there were some scenes that made me question what age demographic this is supposed to be aimed towards, but that was just a fleeting thought.<br /><br />On technicalities alone, this might not be a five-star book. But I felt something while I was reading it. I felt like a little bit of the magic that had been written on the pages came to life and that I had entered a world that was welcoming and enchanting and everything that you want a world to be. I liked the main characters. I liked that they were rather two dimensional in a world that felt so real it was overwhelming.<br /><br />This book has made it onto my \\"personal favorite\\" shelves, so I don't know how to really review it. It's so hard because I am clearly biased; I fell in love with this book. My only thought is that people who enjoyed The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making might very well find themselves enjoying this book, too
B004CURZFC|3.0|The story is predictable for the adults, but the kids enjoy watching such a fantastic story of triumph.  The animation is top-notch.  And it delivers on the promise of a heartfelt ending.
1439102732|2.0|I don't know how I feel about being preached at, even when I agree with the preacher.<br /><br />This review is going to be raw and my most honest review on Amazon to date. This is going to be long and tedious and I will completely understand if it's a TL;DR type deal. No worries. But I feel this must be said.<br /><br />This is because I have been one of those evangelical Christians that were so thoroughly bashed in this novel. I have also been with my very best guy friend in the entire world as he came out and got a whole lot of back lash for it. I stood by him, I supported him and I desperately loved (and still love) him all while I was an evangelical Christian. Even though I am an atheist now, it has nothing to do with any dissatisfaction with my old church or the people who attended. It was just a personal decision I made on my own that most of them know about and don't really care about. They love me just the same and no one has tried to save my soul or any other ridiculous nonsense.<br /><br />I have only read two other books by Picoult and I remember enjoying them both. It's important to mention that I was six years younger when I read them and, although that may be irrelevant, I can't help but feel I'm enjoying her books less and less as I age. I think I'm getting sick of the guilt trips and of the absolutely blatant agenda that her books possess.<br /><br />Let me first say that Picoult's writing style is ridiculously fluid. She is extraordinarily easy to read and even though I quickly figured out this was going to be a message book - and one that sort of slams the message in your face - I kept reading on because her writing style is addicting. I can easily see why she is so popular among the masses. She broaches controversial topics and always roots for the underdog. Couple that with a good writing style and it's gold.<br /><br />The problem is that while she has a good writing style, I would not say that Jodi Picoult is a good writer. There was a lot of reader manipulation happening in this novel - a lot of things that the narrators hid from us when, in a first person narrative, there should have been no secrets kept from the reader, but why is it that reader is never told about Zoe's (view spoiler), something she, herself, says has haunted her for most of her life. If this situation has truly haunted her then why wouldn't she be thinking about it constantly and why would the reader be withheld from it? This was a plot device meant to elicit shock from the reader but it was very poorly executed. Instead of being a surprise, it was obvious manipulation of the text. The same can be said for Vanessa's (view spoiler).<br /><br />The same can be said for the characters: although I think Picoult really did try her best to be as objective as possible, I just couldn't get over the blatant agenda behind this book. A lot of people have said the message is that if you're a homosexual, you will make a fabulous parent. But I don't think that's the message here. In fact, Liddy - possibly the most interesting character - was mentioned many times as having the potential to be a fantastic mother and she was one of the hated evangelical Christians. No, the message here was not about homosexuals being saints. The message was that evangelical Christians are the devil.<br /><br />Listen. I have been around the types mentioned in this novel. I've known the Pastor Clives and the Wade Prestons and I've rolled my eyes in distaste and repulsion along with almost every single Christian person I know. Granted, nearly all of my evangelical friends think being gay is a sin, they would never, and I mean never do any of the things these churches did, such as picketing movie theaters that are promoting gay movies. They consider it to be on the same level as lying - a sin is a sin. It doesn't matter if it's murder or a little white lie, it's still a sin and we all sin. One of my closest friends in the entire world works at a theme park dedicated todoing musicals about the life and death of Christ. She reads her Bible religiously. She talks about Jesus all the time, but I never get sick of it because I can tell it's really important to her. You know what she doesn't do? She doesn't bash gay people. She doesn't say that being gay is a terrible, horrible thing. She supports gay marriage because she doesn't think it's the government's place to say who can or can't marry the person they fell in love with. She may not agree with the lifestyle, but she would never, ever try to take away what we ALL know to be equal rights. She works in the performing arts and is a fantastically talented performer. A great majority of the men she works with are gay and all she ever has to say about them are kind and positive things. Their sexual orientation has never entered into a conversation we've had.<br /><br />I have another friend, a preacher's daughter who married a preacher and is a preacher herself. She is one of the kindest people I've ever met. I remember a time when I had a friend in Uni going through a really tough time and she was doing drugs and just losing herself in the moment. I remember being worried about her but I hated hearing what our friends had to say about her, Christian and atheist alike: \\"Oh,\\" they said, \\"Jane's (not her real name) losing it. She's throwing away her life. How could she be so stupid?\\" And I remember thinking to myself, \\"Why don't you talk to her? Why don't you try and help her stop doing drugs?\\" I really wish I had said those things to them out loud, but instead I always just changed the subject. So, one day, I was out at Starbucks with my preacher's daughter/preacher's wife/preacher friend. I always loved hanging out with her, even after I became an atheist, because she was raw and real and lived what she preached. I love people who have passion - even religious passion - as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else and as long as there is no hate speech involved. I remember Jane coming up in conversation and my preacher friend told me she had hear about her. She said, \\"Don't worry about it. She has great friends who love her. She's just experimenting and if it gets out of control, we're always here for her.\\" This was the LEAST JUDGMENTAL thing I had heard about poor Jane from anyone and it came out of the mouth of the type of person everyone tries to say is the most judgmental of them all.<br /><br />Everyone always runs around saying how it's Christians who are so terribly judgmental - and yeah, there are a lot of them that are, but guess what? Everyone is judgmental. Just like not all Christians are these psychopaths you read about in this novel, not all gay people are saints. I have multiple gay and lesbian friends, but, as I mentioned earlier, I am VERY close to one of them. He has been there for me through a lot of hardships in my life as I have been there for him. He is my rock and I hope I am his, too. This book does paint gays in a good light, I think because it's supporting the underdog. And, for the most part, most of the gay and lesbian friends I have are exceptional people - however a lot of the people they date aren't. Take my best friend for example: his first boyfriend stole his money, used his name to buy a car and then ran off five states away so it became harder to sue him. He treated my friend like he was the scum of the Earth and the worst part was that my friend, one of the strongest, gentlest, most loving and caring men I know, began to believe it. This was an abusive relationship. Does this sound like a good person to you? I hope not because he was one of the worst people I've met in my entire life, and this was a gay man.<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is that being Christian doesn't make a person good or bad and neither does being gay. Being gay, being a Christian, being a whatever... this does NOT define a person's identity. These are just aspects of the overall package. There is absolutely 100% NOTHING wrong with being gay,but there is also nothing wrong with being a Christian either. As long as no one is trying to shove any type of beliefs down my throat, whether they're liberal or conservative, and as long as people can live in harmony, well... isn't that a dream we all share?<br /><br />I remember watching a documentary recently about radical Muslims in Brussels trying to implement the Sharia law in Belgium. So what did some of the Belgians do? They retaliated and now it has turned into this heated battle. Where has the middle ground gone? I'll tell you where: NOWHERE. It is still there. There are open-minded Belgian people and there are moderate Muslims and, in fact, the vast majority fall into this gray area, but no one wants to see it. They want to focus on the radicals. They want to see a fight.<br /><br />I really do think that Picoult tried to convey the fact that not all Christians are psychos with the characters of Max and Liddy, but the problem was that it was a failed attempt. After Max's generous gift at the end and Liddy's revelation, we never hear about their spiritual life again. This made me think: so they can't have these liberal ideas and be Christians at the same time? We never find out if they went back to their old church or if they found a new church and that really bothered me. I think that's where the failure happened. If Picoult had only mentioned something - anything - about this, it would have been so much more successful.<br /><br />I just wish that people would stop attacking other people for believing differently than they do. And I'm not just talking about Christians here. Yes, a lot of what the Christian church preaches makes me cringe, but I am able to see that there's a lot of good that they do, too. However, it's not just the Christians who attack. Atheists attack. Muslims attack. Gay people attack and straight people attack. It's unfair to try and shine a light on one group of people while ignoring the rest. It's unfair not to present a balanced opinion and that's how I felt about a lot of this book: it's unfair.<br /><br />Maybe no one will ever read this review, but if you do and your disagree, I would love to hear your viewpoints if you can share it lovingly. I'm always open to talk about books and I love hearing differing opinions. If, however, it is an attack, it will be deleted.

Brings back all those live shows that I loved!

Wonderful acting, story, etc.  However, if you are not a fan of war movies -- you may not like it, but you should give it a try.  This is not your typical war movie.

0307716554|2.0|Seattle Time said that Afterwards by Rosamund Lupton \\"proves that Lupton is . . .wickedly good.\\" Yes, the author is wickedly good at being repetitive and redundant.  USA Today called this a \\"tragic, tense novel.\\"  It is not tense and only tragic in the sense that the book's length should have been cut in half.  Yes, I admire the theme of a mother doing anything for her children.  At first I thought how the characters of Grace and her daughter Jenny can observe all things without anyone knowing was clever.  However, every time Grace or Jenny learn something to help solve the arson, that information is repeated.  First we hear Grace hear it, then we hear Grace tell Jenny, and then in the next chapter in case you missed it, it is summarized.  This became so tedious that I started skipping parts of entire chapters, which made the book much more enjoyable.  I was so glad to be finished with this book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|From the first page, I was IN. I believed the character(s); I believed the plot; I believed Al's Diner and the portal to the past.<br />King's writing has a lot to do with my immmediate attraction. He makes you feel as if you are in the scene(s), up close and personal. You almost want to join in on the conversations, even when they're in Jake's/George's head!<br /><br />King also knows how to create a well-rounded character, whether good or bad. He never makes the &#34;good guys&#34; angels, and the &#34;bad guys&#34; devils. He creates a bit of sympathy around even the dreaded Oswald...albeit, there's Frank Dunning and Oswald's mother. What a piece of work, they are! Some people are just plain clueless, monsters, and/or incurably insufferable! That King can write the plethora of variations it takes to define his characters springs from a brilliant if not fascinating mind.<br /><br />I tell people, if you think you are not a Stephen King fan (Mr. Horror-able), this novel does not fall in that wheel-house! I also tell them, &#34;Don't be turned off by the Biblical thickness of the book. The novel is a 'page-turner,' and well-worth the sittin'-time!&#34;<br /><br />I originally gave the book at Christmas to my 90 year-old dad to read. He was put off by the sheer girth of the novel, so passed it back to me. I raved about it so much, that, when I forgot it at his house, accidentally on a visit not long ago, I had to down-load it to my Kindle when I returned home, because I couldn't wait two or three weeks before I visited again and could pick up the book. Well, he picked it up (after all my gushing), and is VERY happy he gave it a second chance. He's really into it! Yea!<br /><br />If a book is longer than 400 pages :),  I'll tell folks to read it during the winter months,'  but 11/22/63 can and SHOULD be read ANYtime of the year!<br /><br />The novel is THAT good!<br /><br />Cheers!

B002YCVWXQ|5.0|Inglorious Basterds uses caricatures of an evil incarnate self centered SS officer with a pattern of cunning to achieve his dastardly goals, a clueless almost child like Hitler and Americans who use scalping and baseball metaphors to strike fear in the hearts of Nazis in a revenge fantasy movie that is designed to show that only outsized tactics can succeed against evil on such a grand scale as was perpetrated by the Nazis in general and the SS in particular.  This is classic Quentin Jerome Tarantino.  In the end most of the people who are intrinsically evil as well as those who the audience roots for because of their goals to stop the evil doers die in large numbers.  This movie show the reality of war and it contravenes the usual Hollywood notion that good guys win, come away unscathed and live happily ever after with their chosen significant other.  As in Django Unchained, Tarantino uses outsized characters taking improbable actions in a maelstrom of violence to  make the demarcation between good and evil.  This movie does not cause mental illness it highlights the nefarious results of mental dysfunctionality.

193700788X|1.0|What a bummer!  True, the last few books in the series have left a lot to be desired, but I still had hopes that Charlaine Harris would finish the series with a solid story and an ending that tied it all together nicely.  Rather, I'm still scratching my head as to what happened to the characters that I thought I knew so well.<br /><br />The funny thing is, I'm not even all that opposed to Sookie ending up with Sam.  That being said, Ms. Harris wrote a series finale that hardly touched on the ending of a deep and intense romance that has been developed and furthered in our minds by her pen and her creation.  We heard more about Sookie's lush tomatoes than we did about Eric, and her feelings about losing him.  If she never intended for Sookie to be with him, I can think of a dozen more creative endings in a few minutes that would keep him true to his character...and Sookier true to hers.<br /><br />Eric was introduced to us as a strong, focused, and determined individual who goes after what he wants.  He wanted Sookie from their first meeting, and wooed her with not just passion, but his intelligence and compassion for her as well.  This is hardly the man who would walk away from a woman he loves and with whom he has contemplated eternity without a fight.<br /><br />Ms. Harris once said in an interview that the series would end the way she had always intended for it to.  If that's the case and Sookie was destined to end up with Sam, she should have foreshadowed that a bit more in the past few novels.  And, perhaps of more importance, she should have given Eric and Sookie the opportunity to end their relationship while maintaining their identities as we knew them.<br /><br />Oh, and bringing in the multiple enemies of Copley, Claude, Johan and Steve Newlin was just ridiculous.  Sure, you've got to have conflict to create a good story, but using even one of those old characters to rehash was just stupid.  Pulling in all three?  Completely nonsensical and made the storyworthless to read.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed.  I never felt \\"entitled\\" to one specific ending, but I just wanted a good story that wrapped it all up without sacrificing or assassinating the characters I've grown to love.  Ms. Harris:  I'll never purchase another of your books again.  Ever after.

B0042JTDXK|5.0|I really love the album.  The music is very enjoyable and I always love Josh's singing.  Such a wonderful voice.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very informative and heartbreaking. This movie tells the truth about the meat industry and how backwards the food industry is. Instead of taking care of our people we are slowly killing them with cheap food. Disgusting. We have to have an open dialogue about this tragedy.
B0094M2ITG|5.0|Big Fish is a beautiful story with incredible performances by all cast members. This is perhpas Tim Burton's best movie ever. Great lessons on love, the importance of marriage, how to accept our loved ones as they are and how to enjoy life. Highly recommend.
B000B589JI|2.0|It was cut wrong at the top so it leaks, doesn't hold much fuel. Looks like the pic arrived on time. Expected better because of it being a zippo product, may have just been a dud that escaped.

B005F82X48|4.0|Just discovered this band on Pandora and I had to buy the album to see if they are just a one hit wonder.  Nope!  The entire album was good.  They rock.  Move over Paramore & Flyleaf.  I just wish the album had more songs.  Can't wait for their next album.

B0045HCJ6M|4.0|This is the story of Camelot as it used to be told, without all the New Age mysticism.  Richard Harris, Franco Nero and Vanessa Redgrave at their absolute finest.  The costumes could have been better.....but what a great love story which really pulls you along for the ride.

B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry continues to evolve in depth and complexity...becoming more human. The black box contains all the standard gritiness ,suspense and realism of a bosch novel but up a notch in complexity .
0765316994|5.0|I gave this five stars because of the very novel approach to alternate realities and Scalzi's usual awesome characterizations. The characters in the novel figure out that something is seriously katywampus with some of the bridge crew and the away teams they lead. One of the characters goes farther than anyone else and they finally figure out that their reality is affected by another - and they need to figure out a way to change their fates before they all go the way of other ill-fated Redshirts.<br /><br />A great spoof on the Star Trek Universe as well as the amazing machinations that occur as they follow various clues and solutions they work out given their deduced understanding of the show impacting their lives. Lots of cool twists and turns in the plot, that reach into both realities.<br /><br />Scalzi has come up with another hilarious and intriguing world with great characters and great writing.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|If the ending of Gone Girl left you surprised - don't worry.  This story is great with the same gifted story-telling of Flynn and all the twists and turns you hope for.  Great read!
193700788X|3.0|WARNING: SPOILERS!!!<br />First of all, if there was a choice to give 2 1/2 stars, I would have chosen that. It's not quite good enough for 3 stars, but not quite as bad as 2. I have mixed feelings, but here are a few thoughts.<br />When this book came out, I read the reviews before I read the book. I saw a bunch of one star horrid reviews and questioned if I even wanted to invest my time. Common complaints were that there were holes in her plot and that she completely disregarded her readers and clearly hated writing these books. I have to say, I didn't get that at all. This series has been on its way out the door for a while. I haven't enjoyed the last few books as I had the first several. But it wasn't as bad as some of the worst reviews. I thought it was pretty obvious that Sookie and Sam would end up together. (Or, at least have a turn together) so it wasn't a huge shock for me when Eric left. It was pretty clear from the last book that she was laying the ground work for an Eric-Out/Sam-In scenario. I appreciated the fact that Sookie didn't end the book with proclaiming her undying forever love for Sam. She just said that she could see it, but even if it didn't work out, she would survive. Loose ends seemed to be tied up for many of the other characters as well. I will say, the whole plot against Sookie was a bit larger than life, but that is the nature of this series. Either she is really hated, or really loved, by the fellow characters. All in all, it was a decent enough ending for a very long series. There is simply no way to end something this long without pissing some people off. It's cool. I'm not mad, but I'm not feeling compelled to read it all over again like I do with some of my faves. I'm ready to move on.
B009GYSQV6|4.0|This isn't usually my genre of music. I had stumbled onto Purity Ring's Lofticries one day on Youtube, and loved the song enough to order that album. Amazon's recommendation algorithm suggested this to me. I checked out a few songs, and ultimately bought it. It's a pretty amazing album, especially at first. It was a bit of a shock to realize a whole dimension of musical possibility I wasn't aware of. Later on, the novelty wore off, and some of the songs started to get a bit stale, but the great ones (esp. Plague, Kerosene, and Transgender) never get old.
B002P3RCVU|5.0|I'm really happy with this.  My mom loves this album and I really love the quality of it.  It's my first Michael Buble purchase ever and I'm very satisfiedwith it.

B0000047CX|3.0|I like the music but it's in another language.  I didn't know this and I don't understand the songs.  My fault.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great story<br />Read the entire book in three days!  Will be getting walking disaster tomorrow!  Can't wait.  Good thing it will be the weekend-
193700788X|5.0|Love the series, but am sad that they are ending the storyline. Not too crazy about the ending.  Author needs to continue writing<br />some more Sookie Stackhouse Novels.  It is kind of gimmicky that she is following this book with another one that ties loose ends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and love playing it on my kindle while i am either in the car on the bus or just anywhere else. It's an amazing thing to be able to play! :)

0897502027|5.0|i personally love the book not for the fact that bruce lee's fighting style is laid out step by step but for the fact that this book reminds me that everyday is a gift and through hard work all things can be accomplished and dreams can come to fruition
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this game might get 5or more but it is a very GOOD GAME so think about getting they game yeah.
0393339815|5.0|My first introduction to the famous Jeeves. Very funny in a quiet, comedy of manners sort of a way.  (My younger friends did not find &#34;To say nothing of the dog&#34; amusing at all when we read it together, so you have to like a certain type of humor, I think.  This book is very similar humor, IMO.)  Got us watching the Hugh Lowry version on Netflix, and we've enjoyed those very much too  -- though reading and watching are definitely two distinct pleasures.
B00785P2QC|1.0|I'm trying to decide if i should get this app or not so so please give advice and I'll see what you think of it.
0553801473|3.0|My son liked the books and read them all and enjoyed them, but I couldn't finish the first book of the series even though I am an avid reader.  I am going to go back and try again, because I have a hard time with something that defeats me like a silly book!<br />I gave it a 3 star because he liked it, and I should have liked it, so it averaged out.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Haven't had a chance to play much but so far seems very amateur. Will know more after I have time to work with it longer
B0054SMID0|4.0|Glued to my chair watching.  Lots of excitement. Good lawyer winds up in a dilemma when finds out his client is guilty. Great DVD.

B000WEH74G|5.0|how can anyone have a film collection and not have 47 Ronin? A great film that belongs in any library
B0064X7FVE|3.0|There's probably a way to do it, but I've not yet found it -- but I'd really like to be able to see the weather for locations other than my home location.  Other than that, it's great!  Maybe after I figure out how to add locations so they &#34;stick&#34; it will get a couple more stars.
0525423281|5.0|4.75 stars (only because I adored Anna and the French Kiss slightly more)<br /><br />Lola is a sweet, fun, realistic and heartwarming romance for teens. Lola's family (she's being raised by her gay fathers) adds so much richness, too, which is something that's missing in typical YA reads. Her emotions (even when she's unlikable) are real, raw and understandable, and Cricket Bell is all swoon-worthy geekiness. I read this by the pool on vacation, and that was the perfect setting.
0307950654|4.0|Great Book. Written in a style cohesive with P&P. Loved finding online for a better price than in stores. Buy it!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is very useful and shows the battery life to the approximate percentage and color code. Very easy to use
0783233477|4.0|This is not a fun night movie. I really like it because it makes you think. It is long but I do enjoy it.
B005Z28M58|5.0|My wife loves this show and I watched the first couple seasons then quit but my wife (of two years vs. the shows eight) watched all of it and got me back into it. She already had seasons 1-5 so we had to get 6 and 7 and then 8 when it was available. Loved this and it was sad to see it come to an end.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|very touching story.... that I would love to watch again and again... everyone on a medical field can highly relate...
B0095P33IW|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun.  Action from beginning to end with characters that I really cared about.  Looking forward to the Avengers and the next Captain America movie.

B00AR83PN4|3.0|I bought this to pass the time. But after awhile it got boring not all the impress playing it. I just want to end the game and turn it off after playing it a couple of times. I better to my skylander and card games.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|Best series EVER!!! I watched Step Up, Step Up 2,Step Up 3, and Step Up Revolution.... absolutely ahh mazing love it!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game. I can't get enough of playing this game. I really like the way you have to try to beat your old score to see how fast you've gotten or just see how fun it is to play and you'll never realize how time flew from under you.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|i love this bag. the price is unbeatable. The quality is impeccable and the amount of easy access compartments are very useful. i feel very comfortable about flying down a street on a skateboard with this thing on my back. In the main compartment the customizable dividers are very handy. As a result, i can fit just about anything in there. I have never used it in the raid but is seems water resistant. Another great feature is that there is a series of buckle type clips for a tripod which i love.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|My husband loves this game and can't get enough of it. I wait it for my turn for almost 2 hours and can you believe I've yet to still play it. LOL... Now it's my son turn on his learning games I've purchase. Oh will at least my husband love it and is still playing it. Great pictures and works will on my kindle.
B0042MDAL8|4.0|Lives up to all its hype. I thoroughly enjoyed all the movies.  It has brought me back to liking vampire movies again
0767834739|5.0|This movie is based on the video game series ''Resident Evil'' by Capcom. This is a fun zombie film with lots of action. It's just pure fun all the way around. I love this movie.<br /><br />The film continues the story of the 2002 film, but this time it takes place in Raccoon City. Alice meets Jill, Carlos, and a few other survivors. Most of the citizens of Raccoon City have been turned into zombies from the T-Virus plague, and the main characters are being followed by Nemesis. Along the way, they have to fight against the zombies, lickers, and Nemesis himself.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a fun action-horror film. I love it.
B008MM9630|5.0|I really love this game. It's fun, addictive, and pretty. I like fairies, so a fairy farm is the perfect game concept. It's like Facebook's Farmville, only you get to plant cooler things, because it's not a matter of needing to be more realistic &amp; less fanciful.
B0024FADDI|5.0|Army Of Darkness is definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Sam Raimi is such a unique director. This movie is actually the 3rd film in the Evil Dead Trilogy, and it is also the goofiest. This movie is an action-comedy.  After the events of Evil Dead II, Ash gets transported to the Middle Ages. He needs to get back, so he speaks with an old man who tells him that the only way for Ash to get back is for him to find the Necronomicon (aka The Book Of the Dead) and Ash must say 3 words before he picks up the book. On Ash's journey, the funniest things happen to him. At first he is chased by a spirit, so he hides in a Windmill house. Then he smashes a mirror and he is attacked by little versions of himself. He swallows one of them, which then grows out of his arm and then splits away from Ash's body. Ash then shoots ''Evil Ash'' and buries him. Then when Ash reaches the graveyard, he sees 3 books. And he is attacked by 2 of them.  This next part is the funniest scene in the whole movie. Ash says the 3 words incorrectly. When Ash tries to leave with the book, skeleton hands come out of the ground and pin Ash down to the ground, they then perform a hysterically funny Three Stooges routine on him. They slap him, stick their fingers in his mouth, pick his nose, and try to poke him in the eyes. He then yells at the hands, and a skeleton shoves his whole hand in Ash's mouth, Ash then vomits out the hand, and he manages to get away. It's SO darn funny.  When Ash is riding back to the castle, Evil Ash rises out of the ground, and gathers an army of skeletons and zombies to attack the castle and get the book back. Back at the castle, Ash and the warriors work together to form an army to fight against Evil Ash's army.  Army Of Darkness also has a ton of hilarious and memorable lines of dialogue. It's a really funny movie.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great game.What you do is pick a level.Then try to cut as many fruit as you can.Well that's all.Hope you get this game.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|good story.  quick moving.  few twists and startling scenes.  new fresh story that has not been done to death, you know?
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I got Tiny Monsters on Kindle a year ago. I played it for like two days and deleted. Then, I saw Dragonvale, and thought it looked worth a try. I've been on it ever since. The only fault is that the wait times are long. But they are better than Tiny Monsters. In Tiny Monsters, it was like a 12 hour wait by the second dragon. In Dragonvale, the waits don't hit 12 hours until you reach legendaries or gemstones or really rare dragons. For free, this is one of the best apps on appstore!
B00CBKLO52|5.0|My son wanted this game.  I got it for him and he loves this game.  This is great that we can find games to keep them occupied.
0143113100|5.0|My grandchildren loved it. I thought at first it might put them off with the ending it has (I won't tell what it is) but they got it right away and saw the humor.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My son loves anything about Angry Birds.  We play Angry Birds Friends on my Facebook page.  Since this became an app for our Kindle, he gets to play by himself since I won't let him play my Facebook games without me.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Slightly different from other Grisham books, more humor less suspense but a thoroughly engaging tale.  The cast of characters is endearing, in spite of their flaws and ineptitude.  A good look at the uglier side of tort law and a glimpse of the side that allows the little guy to get his day in court and justice which too often is available only to the privileged.<br />A good story well told.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I'd rank this movie up there with The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 as the most &#34;true to comics feeling&#34; that you'll ever see on the big screen. As a kid growing up I loved the Avengers, and the way this movie played out is exactly as I envisioned them fighting it out as I read the comics as a kid. It was like watching your childhood fantasies realized, in comic book form.<br /><br />This movie could have been a mess. Meshing 6-7+ different characters together is a huge challenge but Joss Whedon pulls it off. Using Nick Fury and SHIELD as the glue, they gather up all the heroes to stop a crisis without ever crossing that campy or uncomfortable line. The actors and writers did their part by adding some strong back-and-forth repartee between them that will cause some laughs as well as some &#34;I can't believe he said that&#34; moments. The action scenes are top notch, most of them true to the comics and the final flurry of an action scene that ends the movie will leave you in awe, wishing for more.<br /><br />The negatives about this film are few but there are some. The film slows down significantly in the middle, with a lot of dialogue and not a whole lot else going on...maybe they were just building up to the last scene but at times it felt like the movie kind of dragged on a bit before it got good again. Also the main villain seems to be Loki but he actually takes a rather large back seat to the invading aliens, which kind of take over the movie at the end. It was disappointing to not see Loki really put up a fight, especially towards the end....I know he is the trickster god and manipulation is his game (and there are elements of that), but it would have been nice to see him do a bit more here than just take a break for large parts of the movie.<br /><br />Still, despite those things, this was a movie that once I saw it at the theaters, I knew I had to own it on DVD. I can only hope the second one is better, as the build-up has already begun (Iron Man 3 is out at the time of this posting), and the proposed villain revealed at the end of this movie left a lot of us drooling for more.out at the time of this posting), and the proposed villain revealed at the end of this movie left a lot of us drooling for more.

1426209584|5.0|Having been to Papua New Guinea and not having had the good fortune of seeing too many Birds of Paradise in their natural habitat, seeing them in this beautifully put together book is fantastic. These birds must be protected at all cost. If they disappear and we can only see them in books, the world will lose a natural treasure.

B0001I55SS|5.0|I liked that this movie was a clean family movie that has a good plot without all the bad language and scenes.  I would recommend it for the whole family.
0385349947|2.0|I wasn't sure what to expect after all of the hype, but there was a lot that didn't resonate with me in this book.  For instance, the book suggests that succeeding in our careers means embracing the fact that our young babies will cry for our nannies instead of for us.  Perhaps we should even see this as a good thing (because it means they have bonded well with their caretakers),.  Personally, I find this unacceptable.  Similarly, I don't think success in our careers requires not knowing the names of any of the kids in our childrens' preschool classrooms.  I found Stilletto Network much more empowering and inspiring.[[ASIN:0814432530 Stiletto Network: Inside the Women's Power Circles That Are Changing the Face of Business]]

B004UHL9EK|4.0|This app works great for me. I've got a few things I do on a regular basis that require timing - and this is just what I needed. It would have gotten 5 stars except it has a minor bug when showing how much time you've got left in the notification bar. Sometimes it doesn't show at all and often it's not correct. I've never had a timer not pop up when it was supposed to though and that's all I really care about!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Besides being over priced cause it is so popluar they can chage whatever this is a great show and well done. I can't wait for next season

B0033H7VI6|5.0|This is an IMPRESSIVE,Heavy,Well designed and finished knife. I normally don't like 'soft sheath ' designs,but the hard insert in this sheath gives rigid protection to the knife and the individual wearing the knife.The knife is secured in the sheath by a strong snap,which I much prefer over velcro closures. PLUS the removeable velcro and buckle closed pocket has plenty of room for a fire-steel and Arkansas sharpening stone. The sheath has a secure velcro belt loop so the sheath can be put on,or removed without loosening your belt. The bottom of sheath lanyard(550 Cord) is a good thing as this heavy knife would be best when well secured to the body.The thick ,heavy blade gives one great confidence of the strength and ability of this SHARP,THICK,FULL TANG blade. The knife lanyard hole is through the steel and well shaped and positioned and the contours of the handle are well cut for a very secure grip that ALL of you fingers will have firm contact with.<br /><br />I have kitchen tested this knife and it holds a edge well. I also used it to clear some brush and cut some 3 to 4 inch trees....OK...I played with it. It batons well and chops well for a short bladed (compared to machette) knife and I would have been confident should a gator or alien come along. I own a few knifes and this is one it would be hard to talk me out of,I will not lend it...IT IS MINE!<br /><br />Better get TWO.

B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|Amazon kinda ruined here. The accent of the movie makes it hard to understand some of the scenes. Amazon on Roku doesn't provide an option to add subtitles.... basically ruining the movie.<br />Will not recommend it to see on Roku.
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|This album is brilliant from start to finish! Dan Smith has such a unique voice that conveys the fullness of emotion in every lyric. I can't choose a favorite, Flaws, Pompeii, Bad Blood, Things We Lost in the Fire, and Laura Palmer are all highlights. Now I just need some US tour dates! Come to Texas!
1451695195|4.0|I bought this for a Christmas present for my parents. They loved the book! It was right up their alley though. This is a book to make you think!
B009MYARIK|4.0|Good book.  With Sophie Kinsella it's always, &#34;what is this character going to do next&#34;.  Hope she never stops writing books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really cool and not so munch fifth this game is cool on the phone or what ever you use. but I also think that the computer vision is even cooler<br /><br />Try out both if you like phone vision that fine but you got to try computer vision ok
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If there isn't a gasp, shocker or laughter then this book wouldn't be for me.  It just makes me wonder if there are any men like Christian in the world and boy if there are, their lives would be fun! Keeps you wanting more and sometimes annoyed but a book should hook and that's what this book had done for me.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I am a big James Bond fan. However this edition of the series; I found  a little boring, but well done I did not find it as exciting as others in the series.  I am looking forward to the next edition of the BOND SERIES
B00BSWMITK|5.0|What to say about Joe??<br />He's the guy... the best I've ever heard. (and seen)<br />Genius as always. I really liked this album. One of his bests, in my opinion.<br />I have no much to say only that I admire him the most.<br />Definitely RECOMMEND.
0470876417|4.0|It's interesting how this books explains in a different way. Instead of reading and reading everything it's explained with charts and drawings without missing information. Very creative.<br /><br />Content is really good also to start thinking without a box
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I laughed I cried. What a great roller coaster  ride. I hated for it to end!  Entertaining from beginning to the end
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a bit different from the PC game. For example: You can't get redstone, it generates but you can't mine it for the dust. However, this runs surprisingly smooth on my kindle fire HD. The controls are not bad at all and allows for you to play effectively (with a little getting used to). I would recommend it to minecraft lovers!
0307476073|5.0|This book was everything I expected. A beautiful read. I am a traveller as well and her story captivated me.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|3D is really quite good. Fun movie for our young kids. Maybe they'll believe for a bit longer then most! Why cut childhood fantasy short, right!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a great game! Hurry and make more levels, please! Couldn't put it down. Sad that it's over.  Reminds me of the Hellraiser box. Love it!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Charges much faster than the micro USB.  Don't have to worry about the kids breaking the USB port.  Cord is adequate.
B0093LE30U|5.0|Absolutely love this series and I have the whole set.  Unfortunately I ruined the first disc in a cleaning machine so needed  to order another for my hubby....was in much dodo.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|Nice story peppered with insight into how the drug industry used to be. Likely contributed to the strict regulations now in place for medical promotion.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The author actually did her research and has produced a novel that is both historically informative for the times and believable.
B00A8LRIEW|4.0|It's it quite on par with their previous releases.  I bought it to complete my collection.  Fits right in with the whole lineage.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|It's the usual Tom Cruise, well actually not even that good.  There was no real acting, and certainly nothing new in Cruise's repertoire.  The little bit of suspense was quickly for-shadowed, or guessed, with having seen all of his other movies.  The female leading actress was sad in her attempts at any romantic interest in this movie; like she was trying too hard.  Maybe it was the script; but this movie is just ok in my book and not worth the movie spent on renting it!!
B00BDSRBXM|4.0|Although this is a new release, it brings the band full circle back to the beginning.  Think Dazzle Ships meets Sugar Tax.
B0024RI72U|5.0|This is one of my favorite metal albums. I love that it's inspired by the Silmarillion from Tolkien. But, even without that inspiration, it is great as far as metal goes.
B002S45V32|5.0|i still kinda wished Ducky wound up with Molly Ringwald.<br />plus you gotta love Andrew &#34;Dice&#34; Clay.<br />quality of video was excellent.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Came in quickly and untouched. Love it so much! I just wish the series wouldn't end... lol Also, I can't wait for the third season...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much better than the first! My son and I love to play it and my son is only 3!
B000NIVJGI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I was really excited for it to be on sale for less than $5...who could really pass that up :)  The item was in excellent condition and packaging was great. Both of my DVD's were in a small box, almost like an envelope.
B00633W614|5.0|I think Jeffrey Archer is a great author and I can't wait until his next book is out. He keeps your interest page after page.
B000I5X824|5.0|I was waiting and waiting for this album to be back in stock, I am so excited to have it. It has all the best songs from their albums and some acoustic stuff as well which is wonderful! I love Aaron Lewis solo and with Staind!
1417006048|5.0|This is a movie that is well done. I like how it goes back into the past and let us remember the strong and sometimes ugly periods of acceptable behavior. The social aspects depict a time of life which seems so simple, a time of sadness yet triumph.  The story line depicts strong friendships and moral fiber. I have watched this movie at least 30x's on vhf and now I'm thrilled to have it on a disc. Great movie to own and treasure. I am lookinf forward to a new and improved copy when printed.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I was hesitant about this film, I rented it from redbox so that way I wouldn't be out a ton of $$ if it stunk. I was pleasantly surprised. Its a typical romantic comedy, but those are the best kind. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This is THE BEST GAME EVER! Awesome tops off all except for number 1 and 2 together like I have AMAZING!!!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|You get to build your own park. There are zero scary parts in the game . I love it so much.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|It app its amazing but need include creating docs in free version some people can needed but you dont know how can i edit docs
B002I0J5FG|5.0|i really love the art style of both these games, and the wonderful music. The controls are a little challenging, and occasionally irritating, but overall i love it a lot.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Fun awesome entertaining. Crazy riding skill. This game is addictive. You should put more cars. Fast and drift able. It's fun to play
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|This extraordinary work is one of the most demanding that I have ever read. It requires considerable concentration to know which &#34;voice&#34; is speaking and to remember which Commander Ga has one's attention.<br /><br />The characters come and go, shifting their &#34;shapes&#34; with survival being the sole purpose of their existence. No &#34;Prisoner&#34; ever had things quite so bad.<br /><br />But the most difficult exercise lay in being willing to accept the social ethos that conditions the North Korean mind. I am constrained to read Kafka again.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have a couple of things to say about this game. Temple Run has really good graphics and is quite addicting once you get started playing the game. I recommend you get this game, because it's worth downloading.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Loved the movie. Watched with my kids and we just enjoyed it from start to end. Strong storyline and positive message all throughout while having some great adult humor thrown in. Will buy.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I am like awkward biggest fan! I love it so freaking much. I just wish that season 3 was Prime on amazon
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I never thought I would be into these books like I am. I am a lover of murder mysteries and this book has me captivated by it. It is well written and I find myself unable to put it down. Can't wait to read the last one.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's okay. The worlds are pretty small and in creative you don't have all the items. But other than that pretty cool game.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I have played this one over and over. I will leave to try other games but keep coming back to this one. Love it for sure!!!!!
B00BSWMITK|4.0|People who say \\"every Joe album sounds the same\\" are missing the point. They only sound the same because his incredibly awesome sound is unique to him, and of course he always sounds like himself.<br /><br />Satch writes great melodies to show off his unparalleled licks, and never forgets to remind the listener that HE is the guitar god, no one else. He's better than Clapton, Hendrix, Santana, or any other rock guitarist. His versatility puts him a notch above everyone else. Yet he's smart enough to know that songs need melody, and not just 5 minutes of shredding. That's why he's still going strong 25 years into his career, with only 1-2 songs ever containing any vocal.<br /><br />Of his latter day records, I'd rank this just below Crystal Planet, and above everything in between. Unlike most critics, I prefer Joe's latter day records to his earlier works. He takes more chances these days, and it makes for a more rewarding listening experience. This record has lots of upbeat fast tempo songs, which is where he shines his brightest.<br /><br />And to think he got his start as guitarist for the Greg Kihn Band !!
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I made a huge mistake purchasing this game despite the reviews.  I found it . Very short. Super glitchy. No fun at all!!!!  G-5 is really losing my confidence!!
B000002VQQ|4.0|Patti Smith's 'Horses' album, recorded in 1975, was and is in a very rare elite league of opus works of original performance art.  There aren't a dozen albums in all of rock history that outweigh 'Horses', in terms of pure poetic firepower.  Smith utterly immortalized herself through the perfection of that album.<br /><br />With all that said, I'm here to tell you that it is an Absolute Freakin TRAVESTY that the much later 're-release' of this album includes a tacked-on, totally out-of-place, insult of a cut: 'my generation'.  Whomever made that decision should be SHOT at sunrise. May the music gods forgive 'em, 'cause I sure won't.<br /><br />If you acquire this album, by all means re-record it so that you can OMIT the 'my generation' add-on.  The perfect original 'Horses' album, and Patti Smith, certainly merit that respect from mere mortals like you and me.
0446693804|5.0|This book is my favorite.love story by far. He pulls you right in! Definitely worth the time to read.go ahead and take a chance. You won't regret it!
1595827684|5.0|This book contains absolutely beautiful artwork from the Mass Effect Series, from concept to final production is really cool to see the thought process put behind the characters and worlds.
B005LAII3U|1.0|I found original movie boring and this one is even worse. Also audio is noticeably out of sync with video as confirmed by many others. Switching between audio tracks seemed to alleviate for a while.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|You will love it if not your lost if you love it I will be happy for the rest of my life if you do not like it your lost and I will be mad so if you do not like it I hope your happy?
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Jack Reacher is a better movie than what is being described by the reviewers who gave it one or two stars.  It seems many people dislike the movie because Tom Cruise is a foot shorter and one hundred pounds lighter than the character described in the books.  Not so sure that makes it a 1 or 2 star movie.  Many say the plot is typical and pointless.  I disagree.  I haven't read ONE SHOT, the book this movie was based on, so I thought that hiding the targeted killing of someone amidst the seemingly senseless slaughter of many to be quite clever.  Granted,it was not unique, but still.  And if you have read the book, well you knew the plot going in.  Those of you who dislike the movie because of Tom Cruise as a person...I guess I would ask why you went to see it in the first place?<br />I agree with those who said the car chase was obligatory and not all that relevant.  But Hollywood just doesn't seem to be able to get away from those.<br />Unlike most reviewers, I am not a fan of the novels, though I've only read the early books in the series.  The Jack Reacher in the books just doesn't seem all that likeable, nor is he easy to relate to.  Cruise's Reacher is a little more likeable, and his motivation easier to comprehend.  Though I wish the whole living off the grid thing would have been explained a little more.<br />My big complaint with this movie is the lack of development of all the characters.  What's up with the lady attorney and her father?  The lead detective's statement concerning not having a choice didn't explain his actions.  And the villain?  Truthfully, he did not seem all that real.  But why was the widow's death his only option? Why was owning that particular construction company so important?<br />There is speculation among some reviewers that because this movie was a box office disappointment there will be no more Jack Reacher movies starring Tom Cruise.  That's too bad.
B003DS9ECQ|5.0|I guess you are never too old to watch a classic from the past. My ten year old son is now into basketball (Michael Jordan...to be specific).  I could not find this on Netflix at all, so I happened to type it into Amazon and to my surprise I was able to view it for a couple of days for a small fee. He watched it on the computer two days in  a row.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Excellent music - great voice and choice of tracks.  I enjoyed listening to it over and over.  I even recommended it to some friends and relatives.
B007AAM4VQ|5.0|Excellent game and a lot of fun for families of all ages to play! For such simple mechanics, there is a lot of strategy about which casinos to control or compete for. The game moves along very fast and can be completed in 30-45mins with 4 players.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|So So cute!!!!<br />This is adorable I even get my cats to play with it!!<br /><br />Fun fun fun!!!<br />Kids would love it too!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Wow!<br />Well... A good story. Loved when i was 10 loved now 15 years later!<br />Hope the movie coming will do the book justice...
B00BVYNSLC|4.0|This is a dark but engrossing thriller with a sci-fi premise.  Particularly notable is Tatiana Maslany's acting.  Each character she plays in this drama thus far is distinct and believable.  You have to begin at the beginning, though.  It is too complicated to enter half way through the series.
B009GX69RK|5.0|C'mon. You know you love Zooey Deschanel. Just embrace it. It's okay. And who doesn't love Winston, the amazing Schmidt, and that life-ruiner, Nick? But seriously, these folks are all in their 30s and still living with roomates, so we knew they were a freakin' mess, right? Actually, I'd kill for roomates right now. Seriously. I can only imagine the combined student loan debt of these four people. And we know, implicitly, that's why they're all here and all so unmotivated. Indentured servitude to the U.S. Department of Education for the next 30 years? Check. No possible way to afford marriage, a house, or a family--EVER? Check. It all makes sense now, so why not embrace a dude who's fun loving, an absolute alcoholic loser, and an eternal project you can work on because, man, it'd be great to have the home and kids and whatnot, but YOU CAN'T work on that project. So you work on Nick. You couldn't have married either the doctor, or the rich guy after all, because they made you feel woefully inadequate sitting in your aging, used Volvo that was handed down to you by mom. When it dies, you can't afford another car. You think, hey, maybe I deserve Nick. This is as good as it gets. Working on myself is a wasted effort. Working on Nick, on the other hand, is like Pretty Womaning a homeless dude.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I had hear a lot of hype about this one and was a bit disappointed.  It had some action and some humor, but not a lot.  Story line was good with a few twists.  Worth watching once. Won't be on our repeat play list!
B00007LTIB|4.0|... because it's more focused than &#34;Topographic Oceans,&#34; which I wouldn't buy when it was new and probably won't anytime soon.  The great trilogy - &#34;The Yes Album,&#34; &#34;Fragile,&#34; and &#34;Close to the Edge&#34; - could not be topped.  This album displays some &#34;serious classical&#34; pretensions, but didn't they all?  A bit of a bite to it, and more talent and thought in it than elevator music.
0307272702|2.0|Not what i expected. very involved and hard to read. will give to someone else that may like the technical stuff
B00007KWHO|4.0|This is the second album by Yes, recorded with an orchestra.  It does not contain all original material.  In fact, the lead track, and one of the more impressive, was written by the late folksinger Richie Havens.  Whether it will interest anyone other than devotees of English progressive rock is questionable, and it is not as fully thought-out as the trilogy of landmark records that would follow.  On the other hand it was more enjoyable than I remembered.
B0068THAGY|4.0|Some great character profiles developed in the story. It was engaging and you were interested in the individual characters. I recommend
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|An unforgettable tale based on the unimaginably cruel orphanages run by the Catholic church in Ireland up until 1996.  Despite the sadness of the main character's childhood this is not a depressing book to read for it is told by an expert author who intertwined hope, humor and happiness throughout the story.  I couldn't put it down.  Do yourself a favor and read this book as soon as you can.
006207377X|4.0|Mais oui ! Our small man with large moustaches and a egg shaped head is back. Does he live in England, speak French, and come from Belgium? Eh bien, it must be Agatha Christie's famous flatfoot, Hercule Poirot. This is my fifth Hercule mystery, and as customary, I didn't solve the murder. But I did solve 'Death on the Nile', so a twenty percent solving average is not bad. In this investigation, even the great Hercule was stumped for awhile as he thought to himself, \\"Is it possible that I am growing old?\\" But he must have been doing his job, since one of the suspects, Jane Olivera, said to him, \\"I loathe the sight of you-you bloody little bourgeois detective!\\" That's the Hercule that I know and love. Agatha wrote 37 Hercule Poirot mysteries, the final one was 'Curtain: Poirot's Last Case'. She wrote the novel during World War II, but didn't publish it till 1975, a year before her own death. Agatha was a master at writing main plots, creating subplots, and inserting plot twists into every novel. Her books usually had around ten suspects, yet Agatha was able to inject `reader's sympathy' into most of the characters, so  the reader was freely empowered to root for the innocence of their favorite hypothetical felon. She certainly achieved that in this novel.<br /><br />So it's time for Hercule's six month oral checkup, and he has the same fears as you and I. The superior Hercule was not himself. On page nine...\\"His morale was down to zero. He was just that ordinary, craven figure, a man afraid of the dentist's chair.\\" While in the waiting room, our sleuth observes the other patients. There was a military looking man, and a  seemingly angry young man flipping pages of magazines. Hercule has his appointment with Doctor Henry Morley and prepares to leave after some minor filling work. Hercule learns that the Doc's assistant, Gladys Neville, is missing, and an important banker, Alistair Blunt, is on his way for his dental appointment. On his way out, He observes a fierce looking man in the waiting room, and outside a lady leaving a taxi who has torn her buckle off her shoe as she  exited. Later that day, Hercule is informed by Chief Inspector Japp (you remember him from previous novels) of Scotland Yard that Doctor Morley has shot himself. How can that be? The Doc seemed normal and trouble free. Hercule Poirot suspects murder, and gathers a list of suspects.<br /><br />The possible perpetrators are: Doctor Reilly, Morley's partner; Mr. Amberiotis, the last patient; Miss Sainsbury Seale, the taxi lady; Howard Raikes, the American; Alistair Blunt, the banker; Frank Carter, the angry young man; Gladys Neville, the missing assistant; Jane Olivera, Blunt's niece; and Alfred Biggs, the murdered Doc's page boy. Then the unthinkable happens on page 53, Mr. Amberiotis turns up dead at his hotel! He is dead from an overdose of adrenaline and novocaine. What? Was he poisoned by Doctor Morley before the Doc committed suicide, or was murdered?<br /><br />Hercule Poirot is stumped. Then later in the novel, he is in church with Alistair Blunt, Jane Olivera, her mom, and Howard Raikes, while listening to the morning sermon, the light bulb goes off: \\"It was like a kaleidoscope-shoe buckles, 10-inch stockings, a damaged face, the low tastes in literature of Alfred the page boy, the activities of Mr. Amberiotis, and the part played by the late Mr. Morley, all rose up and whirled and settled themselves down into a coherent pattern.\\" Okay, Mr. Poirot's noggin is working again. Now is the time that you should grab your own copy of this highly recommended mystery.king man in the waiting room, and outside a lady leaving a taxi who has torn her buckle off her shoe as she  exited.

6305428042|5.0|Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy -  a triple threat that anyone who grew up in the 90s knows makes for an absolutely fantastic Halloween movie! I mean, this is by far my favorite Halloween movie and I am so excited to now own my own copy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game and so does my kids. This game is a great way 2 kill time anywhere at anytime. Thank you Nordcurrent.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Casper. The friendliest ghost you know! Seriously, another a great 90s Halloween movie. I went on a binge and bought a bunch of these movies on Amazon and probably had the greatest Halloween known to man! Do yourself a Hallow favor and buy the movie!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game, it really make you think. I have it on my Ipod I just wish it was free here so I don't have to buy it again.  I this the is a wonderful game for anyone who enjoys puzzles or just wants a challenge.<br />★★★★★
B008ROGQAE|4.0|I have not seen the movie since I was a young teenager. Very well made & ahead of its time. Even my own daughter liked it and compared it to Hunger Games.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I really enjoyed the historical aspect of the book.  I had no idea about some of Tesla's accomplishments.  I was NOT interested with the author's supposed analysis and how to apply the principles of Tesla's life to the reader's personal situation.  Tesla was so extraordinarily gifted (a particularly important design came to him in a dream), that we couldn't possibly use his accomplishments as the backdrop for the self-help drivel the author puts forth.  I'd have been irked if the book hadn't been free.<br /><br />Read the book (it's short) for the extraordinary life history of Tesla.  Breeze over the author's analysis.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Just one word to say this was a really awesome movie a great plot I cant understand why it  didn't do as good as it did.....but you know you got some a critics out there you know no matter how good the movie is......they are  gonna be critical about it .....I would definitely recommend this to my friends.......awesome plot ......love the tiger....... Long live Richard Parker ........thankx
0307476073|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It made me want to hike the Pacific Crest Trail.  Cheryl writes honestly about her experiences which are much like my own.
B000068FXR|3.0|CRIME OF THE CENTURY, the '74 classic that came before this, is BRILLIANT. So after a 4 1/2 effort, this next CD from Supertramp feels a bit rushed. Or as if some of the songs were leftover from the &#34;Crime&#34; sessions. There are some gems here: &#34;Sister Moonshine,&#34; &#34;Ain't Nobody But Me&#34; (my fav track!!!), &#34;A Soapbox Opera,&#34; and &#34;Lady&#34; are all fantastic tunes. But this collection's weakness lies in the final 1/3. Again, it's not bad. But it's not particularly memorable either. Especially when compared to the epic track endings to the band's next two CDs (&#34;Fool's Overture&#34; on EVEN IN THE QUIETEST MOMENTS... and &#34;Child of Vision&#34; on BREAKFAST IN AMERICA, both tunes which are brilliant anthems).<br /><br />So yeah, if you're a completist, pick up CRISIS? WHAT CRISIS? But for the casual Supertramp fan, pick up CRIME, EVEN IN..., BREAKFAST, and FAMOUS LAST WORDS...&#34; Each one of them is a very strong collection of enduring songs.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|This one hits home because my niece is going through a similar situation.  Her mother and some friends are at the point where they're telling her to simply quit but she refuses.
B000069HJI|4.0|This CD is GREAT. But how come people don't mention it in the same breath as Supertramp's other classics? Well, they should. FAMOUS LAST WORDS, despite a bit of cheesy 80s production in spots (&#34;It's Raining Again&#34;), is an absolute pop delight. The title cut &#34;Crazy&#34; is one of the band's best songs ever, with Roger Hodgson providing another pop classic. But then Rick Davies takes it to another level with two of his best songs ever: &#34;Put On Your Old Brown Shoes&#34; and the absolutely fantastic &#34;Bonnie.&#34; This is songwriter Davies at his finest, offering up emotional vocals, great melodies, and solid piano chops. Sure, &#34;Bonnie&#34; does remind me of Billy Joel just a bit, especially on first listen. But who cares? It's still a damn awesome song. Epic pop!<br /><br />Notice that I'm skipping &#34;It's Raining Again?&#34; Yeah, I remember when this album came out. The was the first single from the record and the song was cheesy and dull in 1982. It's pretty much unbearable now. Like many fans who loved BREAKFAST IN AMERICA, I was excited to hear new Supertramp in '82. But this first taste was too saccharine for my tastes. So I ended up never buying the record.<br /><br />Thank goodness I finally got around to it now (albeit 30 years later). Because after skipping &#34;It's Raining Again,&#34; the remainder of the CD is wonderful. Roger Hodgson is a truly gifted songwriter and &#34;Know Who You Are&#34; and &#34;C'est Le Bon&#34; are two of his all-time best tunes. Both are sumptuous descent into self-introspection, with the songwriter reflecting upon his own challenges and gifts as a creative entity struggling to create in a world that is hostile to creativity. The results are cries to both himself and the artists within us all. These songs truly speak to both the music fan and musician equally.<br /><br />Then after another great Davies' tune, &#34;Waiting So Long,&#34; the CD concludes with another great Supertramp epic: &#34;Don't LeaveMe Now.&#34; Man, all I can say about this tune is... WOW. This must have been a powerful when performed live. Anyone who thinks FAMOUS... is a throwaway CD from an otherwise great band should put on this tune. Trust me, you will buy / download the rest of the record ASAP.<br /><br />Sure, CRIME OF THE CENTURY and BREAKFAST IN AMERICA are still Supertramp's best two records. But FAMOUS LAST WORDS is third highest in the Supertramp canon, tied in quality (IMHO) with EVEN IN THE QUIETEST MOMENTS.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very enlightening, I now use fooducate app in every store.  Shopping takes a little longer but it's worth it in the end.

B008602KQI|5.0|I was captivated from the every start. There was thrill, romance and adventure. The acting was excellent and so was the story line. Good flick.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE the fifty shades series. Can be pretty repetitive and not the best source of writing but over all a great story and very erotic!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|rec'd cd and blue ray. blue ray would not play. another one sent out to me, work just fine. GREAT movie!  good service!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Phantom of the Opera is still my all time favorite musical movie, but this one is a close second. Love it!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|GREAT movie, highly recommend for all ages.  Im 52 and I've watched it over and over.  Movie arrived before deadline and in excellent condition.  Great service!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We are normally &#34;Go out to the movies&#34; type people, but we saw this one in theater and loved it!
B001EBWING|5.0|Everyone in this movie was cast perfectly.  The one liners and familiar phrases were so nice to hear again.  If you love a great romance with an even better story line see this movie again.  I honestly forgot how good it was.  Rick is a guy that always does the right thing no matter how much it hurts, I love that about him.  And of course Ingrid was so beautiful!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome book, easy to read, great coming of age story.  Definitely would recommend for those who are curious as to what the movie will be about.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Charged my phone - my android reports it is charging AC, so works for me! I haven't tested the Apple port.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very true and throughought. Woud recommand it to anybody who wants to better understand his/her partner. This book has a lot of &#34;ha has&#34;', eye opening sections!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Finally I have a calculator that's easy to see and easy to operate... and all within my Kindle Fire.  This is a great app.  Very convenient to get to.  I have a computer on my phone but it's difficult to navigate. I highly recommend the Calculator Plus Free.
0756405890|5.0|If you think about it, all escapist fiction is wish-fulfillment or violence/strength/power/skill and/or wit overcoming obstacles.  Sometimes with ease and sometimes with great difficult.  Magic = wish-fulfillment on some level.  When we don't like a book and others do, the feeling of disgruntlement over the whole thing is ridiculous.  It is all a bunch of ego stroking at its best.  I suspect there is probably more irrational over rational impulses informing our likes and dislikes with respect to entertainment, so don't be offended when others like things you don't.  It doesn't mean your smart and they are dumb or vise versa.
B00B8PRDHE|4.0|Could be better, only 2.0 audio remixed, but i love the band, pieace and love ringo! see ya in brazil
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great book! I love the whole series! I really like how Charlaine Harris ended the series and wrapped everything up.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a powerfully addicting show- the writing and acting are top notch.  Toughest part after watching season 3 will be to wait until the fall to see season 4!
B004ZG5F28|2.0|Dnting - poor investment.isappointing - poor investment.<br />Simple plot, awkward acting, dragging and oftentimes predictably boring and irrational.  The movie was recommended to us by a European source, maybe that's the difference for our reaction.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this type of game.  It makes me think and reason which somethimes is easy to overlook when things are too easy.  I tried not to use the hints.  Fun game.  I would love to see more &#34;Rooms&#34;.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the amazon prime app. It works so well on my ipad. I can't wait for season 3 to be out.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I bought this book on recommendation from a friend who said it would suit anyone with a background or interest in child development. She was right. The author clearly did her research about the issues a small child raised in isolation might deal with, even when brought up by a loving mother. If you get distracted by nonstandard English in a narrator, you'll hate this book, but if you're able to go with the flow and accept a child narrator for what he is, you're in for a real treat. Could be triggering to survivors of sexual assault.
B00821PCJS|2.0|Ok for a tv series I wouldn't want to pay a lot for it. I was confused at the beginning thought I had missed something.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|With this one I can take macro photo more easy. You can use with canon sx50 hand hold or you may buy lens filter set(another $20 for 58mm adapter, filer, hood and cap).
B008RJFRTK|1.0|Found that gps indicator rarelt updated your position, and usually only if you back out and back into the app.  Searches for names of resteraunts, etc don't always return reliably - search once results will not show on the map, only the address.
B008PZZR5K|4.0|It was a good movie, but you need to provide more movies like. I am a Star Trek fan so its hard for me not to appreciate the movie.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|Well i have an Kindle Fire and it acts like it doesnt want to play what do i do use the internet???!!
B000N4SADC|5.0|This is just incredible music!  It is complex without sounding nerdy.  All the musicians are extraordinary.  Better people than me have said Hiromi is a genius. That word is used too readily, but in this case, it applies.
B00464AVXW|5.0|Thrillers like Se7en don't come around that often.  It's no Silence of the Lambs, but definately worth watching if you're intrigued by criminal psychology.<br />The film was perfectly cast.  Brad Pittl and Morgan Freeman have a fantastic chemistry and should do more movies together.  Plus you have to remember Brad Pitt was still practically an unknown when he stared in Se7en.  Interview with a Vampire came out a year prior.  It was interesting to see him when he was younger.<br />Personally, I think Se7en was one of David Fincher's best works.  One of his first films just happened to be one of his best.
1607053551|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much because it offered alot of information in an easy to find format. If you are interested in creating your own surface designs, this is a great book.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Wonderful CPU!! I have 3 of these and one i7 3770K. The i5 3570K in my experience of the two has been a more stable chip for me.I can tell you, this chip is great!!! ITs stable, no matter what the settings. The integrated graphics are truly amazing considering they are coming from the CPU itself. You almost don't need a discreet graphics card (almost). ; )<br /><br />One thing I did run into is one of the three chips I have of this variety could not handle RAM any higher than 2400 mhz. It would not run G Skill Trident-X 2666mhz RAM even on the XMP settings. No matter what I tried or what voltages etc. would not post anything higher than 2400 mhz. After conferring with some industry \\"in the knows\\" a conclusion has been drawn that the majority of the chips (CPU's) manufactured in Cost Rica(the 3rd Gen. i5 flavor) do not handle RAM higher than 2400 mhz. Apparently the IMC's (Internal Memory Controllers) on these chips just aren't robust enough to take the higher speed RAM's. At first I was worried that any of the 3570K chips would not run higher RAM speeds. Luckily some do. I was concerned that I might have to go with the 3770K's exclusively if I wanted faster ram speed settings. Glad this did not turn out to be the case. The 3770k is at least $100 more expensive and I found this chip to be more to my liking. (more stable for me )<br /><br />One of the experts I conferred with indicated that out of 16 consumer retail CPU's (i5 3570K) chips, only 5 or 6 of the lot of 16 would run or post at any RAM setting higher than 2400mhz. Even though the board is rated for RAM speed up through 2800 (even higher settings into the 30k's is listed in this boards BIOS)<br /><br />That said I ordered 2 additional CPU's and luckily they both were manufactured in Malaysia (marked \\"Malay\\")and both ran 2666 mhz RAM no problems. So I would have to agree there is some validity to what this gentleman was saying.<br /><br />So if your into overclocking and/or going to run RAM any faster than 2400 mhz I would make sure you go for the \\"Malaysia\\" manufactured chips instead of the \\"Costa Rica\\" chips. Its not guaranteed either way, as he did have some run at 2666 mhz from \\"Costa\\" however, chances are more that you wont be able to run higher RAM speeds than the chances that you will. So far I am two for two on the Malaysian chips and one for one on the costa Rica chips. Either way, great CPU's and if you have no plans to use higher settings then by all means the Costa Rica chips are fine. Enjoy!!
0307895475|5.0|Couldn't imagine playing the game without it. WOULD RECOMMEND. Extremely detailed, awesome inventory section and a huge fold out map comes with every book. This book is the S*** for this game.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I just finished The Misremembered Man and I have to say that I really enjoyed it.  The characters are well formed and the story is funny, sad and heartwarming.  Your heart breaks for Jamie as his childhood is described.  You want Lydia to break out of her routine and realize that she deserves to be happy.  A good story, well told.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Obviously the book is much better but this adaptation doesn't suck. I would have preferred that they had someone that better matched the book's description. Some of the lines fell flat as a result like his puzzlement that people really wanted to mess with him based on first impressions. Really Cruise? Reacher is a mountain of a man, you're barely a hill.
B00881VLCE|4.0|pretty cool but has a few issues. at times it doesn't load properly. also lost a puzzle which was almost completed!!!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Great quality. Better than iMac openmic. Don't cut your voice and the fidelity is very good. The wire is extremely long.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Another game that made sense to me and was beautiful as well.  I enjoyed every second and wish I could find other games like this one.  The puzzles were varied and not typical.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I got this over a month ago but I didn't want to review it until it was tested (phone was dropped)...<br />It fell out of my jacket pocket onto the pavement and I can honestly say my heart froze in terror of the thought of looking<br />at my phone and it being shattered, to my very great surprise my phone was like new!!<br />no damage was done at all which is all that matters to me.... even if later I have to buy a new one due to discoloring its<br />ok bc I know my phone will be protected.  I know a few ppl with other case that have dropped their phones from the same height or even less and their screens crack, this case really is a phone saver!
B00BY9GQHM|2.0|I love hidden object games, but I like somewhat of a story line and I love finding my way around in a &#34;new&#34; world.  I never really &#34;got&#34; this game.  It became routine and boring after awhile.  Graphics were mediocre at best.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|Disappointing.<br /><br />After waiting 5 seasons for Castle and Kate to  get together, after the 4th season finale, they barely acted like a couple in love.  So few tender moments between them.  No passion at all, no banter, and I hated the near kisses. Too little focus on their relationship.  However, I liked most of the stories, with the exception of the more  inane ones.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Beautiful graphics, excellent hints, and the story line made perfect sense.  It took me several days to complete the game and I was disappointed when it finally ended because I enjoyed playing so much.  The story flowed logically and smoothly.  No aimless, abrupt jumps around a map.  The humans depicted on this game were very realistic.  One looked like Walt on Breaking Bad!  Wish I was as pleased with all the games I've purchased as I am with this one.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Great edition with lots of special features. A welcome replacement to my worn out VHS! The quality is outstanding. Highly recommended to any parent or grandparent looking for a funny, clean and cute movie
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this game is da bomb.it's like the cuzin of grand theft auto. this game is awsum and great. get it.
B005RZ8W94|5.0|This is an awesome band! The show in here is awesome there is a very high energy, this band really rocks.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It is just ok - it works great but was hopinv for it to be able fo be running runningon screen like the one's on the HTC Evo droid phone my wife has,
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I liked that you could go at your own pace and not be timed.  It was nice to have the clues if needed.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|Use it to take nots at church.  I love it because it is way easier to use than just typing on the keyboard.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game.... when I need to waste some time, this is what I play. Its designed for quick movement of the cards. Great game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is one of the best games (apps) I've every downloadded. It is filled with action and gaming and is great for everyone.
B00993FEUK|5.0|Love this movie and great entertainment for my kids also, I always love good animated movies and this one a keeper.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I was sure this was going to be just like a Julia Roberts movie I had seen. With the encouragement of my friend I sat through it, and I am glad I did. It was a good and I enjoyed it
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|The series is finally over.  Sanderson did a great job with the material, it would have been a five star but the last battle dragged on.  Maybe that was the point, but the story got muddled and the really dramatic moments got lost.  Otherwise I thought the few plot twist that could be woven in were well executed.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Great app easy to setup easy to use.<br />I got the app and used it in a emergency situation and was happy to have it work so well for me.
1400069742|5.0|Extensive research and excellent writing make this book as compelling as was her prior Citizens of London.  Very detailed accounts of the time and the events make this book difficult to put down.
B003YOMN68|3.0|The music quality is nothing like the highest quality CD recording I've heard, but it's good considering the price as the highest quality CD version is getting hard to find and I think it's priced $30 now.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This is a great show, it does remind me of the movie Seven. I would recommend and did enjoy watching.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game has every thing that I wanted the speed of a car game and the skills that I can match
6305428352|5.0|You cannot help but cry at this one.  There are so many emotions it takes you through that you have to stop and rest at the end.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|So good that I read it twice. Lots of people who aren't particularly into Japanese history seem to like it. Similar to reading a fantasy novel like Game of Thrones, but more exciting because it's completely based on real history.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I just finished watching Flight and I must say it was a surprising presentation.<br />For the most part, I am a fan of Denzel Washington and truly enjoy the majority of his movies.In this one, one positive note was that the acting by all was good. However, after the much publicized showing, of the air craft, malfunctioning and his  flying the jet upside down and bringing the plane in for a landing on an open field,is where the film begins to crash and really slows down for me.The theme of drugs and alcohol in pilots are  serious issues but,as far as I could see, there were scenes that were repetitive and even one of nudity that added nothing to the overall story. You know how movies are rated 1,2,3,4,or 5 stars,this one for me was rated in yawns and I give it 4 yawns.
B0054SMID0|5.0|We really enjoyed watching this movie! The plot was full of surprise twists. It showed the real LA, not just the Bel Aire/Beverly Hills view we usually see on the screen (I have lived and worked in the LA area all my life).  Great shots: e.g. The County Jail, LA River, and Metro Link train, all in the final scene. There should be a sequel!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This was a nice movie, except it had too my cursing in it. The (4) letter words took away from the subject matter
0439023521|5.0|This is the first fiction book I've read for leisure in over 10 years. I was pleasantly surprised. The writing is excellent and compelling to continue the read.<br /><br />As a pseudo-casual reader, I'm quite glad I made this book the choice to get back into reading.
B0078N2T8I|3.0|We bought the video because we loved &#34;Mud,&#34; the new movie by the same director, Jeff Nichols. Although there are similarities, &#34;Take Shelter&#34; is much slower and harder to connect to than &#34;Mud.&#34; Nichols has definitely gotten better as a director.
0439023491|5.0|I was totally looking forward to reading Catching Fire after the Hunger Games. Although there were points where the story dragged a little, overall, it was even better than the first book. Definitely a good read.
B00A1C17EK|5.0|I've seen some beautiful clips on YouTube (that have since been removed) that have made me want to see this.  Please release this in the states - there are many of us with taste who would love to experience this retelling of these stories!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A little disappointed with how the story ends, however, it couldn’t really end any other way without it seeming cheesy. Loved the details, a must read to conclude the Hunger Games trilogy.
0812993845|3.0|I used to find Ms. Kinsella charming and funny. Now I feel her books read somewhat like a manic episode where her characters aspire to these highly improbable grandiose adventures where something bad happens and the character is inconsolably crushed for 20 or so pages before coming up with the next grandiose scheme and so on. Even the Shopaholic books became old hat with the amounts of money Becky was spending.<br /><br />Make no mistake, Sophie has grand talent and an even grander imagination, which is probably why I have read most of her books (I do not care for her Madeline Wickham persona, perhaps because that one seems manic and mean spirited). However, I hope perhaps she can manage another book like Can You Keep a Secret? The same grandiosity but on a much calmer scale.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan given this a read but if you are tired of the same hyper characters, give it a pass.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I did not want to join facebook.  Therefore I was unable to compete in the contest , which required one to join facebook.
1449437524|1.0|A little more 4th grade boy body function humor than I realized. But the premise is good .. Maybe create your own less body-parts focused version.
B009R659L8|3.0|Normally, I am happy when a new book by MHC appears on the new-book list, and I read the entire book in about 3 days. This one sits on the table for days at a time, then read when I have nothing else to do.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Lenjoy all or any thing to do mahjong. This one is time so I try to go fast aqs I can. Just to keep my mind and hands to move fast.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|Although the movie is somewhat entertaining anyone who has read even one of the Reacher books will know that this is a counterfeit Reacher.  If you aren't an avid reader of Child's work then you might give this movie a little higher rating but for a real fan this is a &#34;little&#34; disappointment.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The language and subsequent imagery of this book is superb. I have read scores of books, but none...not one, rivals the story of this book. The movie is also excellent, also standing alone in its marvel, but cannot plumb the depths of this amazing novel. Zoology, Theology, sheer terror and joy, The Life of Pi has it all.
1401235425|5.0|Until recently, my only experience with graphic novels came as a young girl. I remember an uncle who had quite the collection. When we would visit I would make my through some of his collection gravitating toward those titles that would appeal to a very young girl - think cartoon rather than action/adventure. Even though I clearly have a strong preference for movies based on comic books, it never occurred to me to acquire an interest in graphic novels. That all changed when I noticed that some of my favorite urban fantasy series started publishing graphic novel companions, which now has me browsing and purchasing from that section of the book store and growing ever more interested . . . as if I was not already geeky enough.<br /><br />Skip forward to a couple of weeks ago when I won a Good Reads first reads copy Batman Vol. 2: The City of Owls from the New 52 of DC Comics. Batman has long been one of my favorite super hero characters. His darkness speaks to my darkness, what can I say. I was so excited when I got the notice that it was in the mail that I gave a big girl squeal and then rushed right out and purchased Batman Vol 1: The Court of Owls. (Well, I could hardly start at Volume 2, could I?).<br /><br />My understanding of The New 52 is that DC Comics basically scrapped their entire line of comics, then picked 52 titles to move forward and reboot. This is part of a big effort to make them more appealing to younger, newer readers. I may not fit into the younger category, but score 1 new reader for DC Comics - strategy successful!<br /><br />I tried my best to savor Court of Owls, my first Batman graphic novel, but I just could not hold myself back. The story was very well-written, entertaining and deliciously dark. I was actually surprised at the depth of the story for a graphic novel. Perhaps I was able to perceive this depth due to my history with the Batman lore through the cinema?<br /><br />Knowing what I do about the New 52, I was kind of impressed at how they made this transition with the Batman series. The opening features a montage of the classic characters and villains to kind of establish that they are there. I admit to not being able to identify all of them, but hey, I have Google, right? And the Robin/Nightwing transition? I need to figure that one out, as well. I am hoping some details are filled in my the story in future volumes. Once past these basics, the new storyline began to unfold, telling a tale of conspiracy that ties the present to the past (how very Batman!)<br /><br />The artwork was completely awesome. I am sure that some hard core Bataficionado might critique it in comparison with past version, but I have no such hang-ups. Clean-slate, here. I especially loved the chapter cover images (Is that what they are), in particular the one for chapter 3. Simply awesome.<br /><br />Will I be at loyal Batfan from here on out? That remains to be seen. Will I be stalking the shelves for Volume 3 as soon as I finish my newly arrived Volume 2? You betcha!w they made this transition with the Batman series.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|From the beginning you sense that it won't end well, but it is so well written that it is hard to put down.  It doesn't take long to realize that Andy is in denial, but it is sad as you watch him build higher and higher walls then decorate them reinforce his &#34;rightness&#34; and keep the invaders at bay be they friend or foe.

B0066W1AZK|4.0|Good AI and fun!  I am enjoying and having good time with this App.<br />Free. Fast. No bugs. Fair enough!
B005S9ELVC|4.0|Enjoyed this movie. Had to overlook a lot of violence. Typical gangster movie, Great acting in this action film. Recommend!
B0032JTV74|4.0|The blue ray edition was cheaper than the DVD and being blue ray was more compact.  The content was the original Glee which had that many episodes that we haven't finished watching it yet but it is well presented and worth the money.  This blue ray is the very first season and had more disco type music, we do prefer the 3rd season as they do more popular songs but it is still worth watching, great program
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|Action packed movie, not too many surprises, felt  if I had seen it all before.  Big Tom Cruise fans will probably enjoy it more than I.  Kind of felt let down!
B003I55BIA|4.0|While some parts of the story toy the line between realistic and unbelievable, Elkeles does a great job creating a fantastic story. It is was definitely a difficult book to put down. It was impossible not to hope and believe in the characters and want them to succeed. It definitely reminded me of a modern day, twisted fairy tale. Elkeles has yet to disappoint me with her novels.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Jamie Fox  was great!  Sometimes hard to watch, language offensive at times but great story and storytelling in this film.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I really appreciate the hand written entry format especially when time is short and info is coming from many sources at once. The selective deletion feature is very useful.

020161622X|5.0|Right out of college I landed some clientele and jumped right into freelancing, so I never really had the opportunity to work with other programmers in a team environment. &#34;The Pragmatic Programmer&#34;, though a little dated, brings years of trial by fire proven coding techniques and practices to the table, which was great for me being I was flying solo and had no one to collaborate with. I would recommend this title to any code monkey out there looking to improve the quality of their code.

0593070151|3.0|Wedding Night, the latest novel from popular chick lit author Sophie Kinsella, exhibits her trademark charm and penchant for absurd humour.<br /><br />Her heroine is thirty year old Lottie Graveney who is devastated when the marriage proposal she is expecting from her long time beau Richard isn't forthcoming. In fact he tells her he is not interested in marriage in the forseeable future and for Lottie that means the end of their relationship. She is still reeling from the break up when her ex boyfriend, Ben, gets in touch after more than a decade's silence. As the pair reminisce about the summer they spent together on the idyllic Greek island where they met, Ben reminds Lottie of their pact to get married if they were both still single at thirty, confesses he never stopped loving her and proposes almost all in one breath. Lottie says yes and the pair decide not to wait arranging a no fuss registry wedding for just a few days hence. Lottie has only one condition - no sex until their wedding night. Despite the strenuous objections of Lottie's sister, Fliss, and Ben's best friend, Lorcan, the marriage goes ahead and the newlyweds jet off to Ikonos for their honeymoon, but Fliss isn't about to let her sister make the biggest mistake of her life and she will do anything to stop them consummating the marriage.<br /><br />Wedding Night is pretty much exactly what I expected from Kinsella, the plot is predictable, the characters largely OTT and yet it doesn't seem to matter much because it's all good fun, even if utterly unbelievable.<br />Where Wedding Night does differ from other novels I have read by Kinsella is the narrative told from two point of views. Lottie is the flaky, starry eyed heroine familiar to the author's readers while her older sister, Fliss is a little more sensible and cynical. I liked Fliss a little more than Lottie though neither behave particularly well, Fliss is overzealous in her attempt to help her sister while Lottie makes a cascade of impulsive decisions.<br />As long as you don't overthink it, there are some real laugh out loud moments as Lottie's and Ben's attempts to consummate their marriage are deftly thwarted by the hotel manager at the behest of Fliss including broken volume controls, intrusive butlers and a couples massage that causes Lottie to have a painful allergic reaction.<br /><br />A lighthearted rom-com, Wedding Night is a amusing way to spend an hour or two when you don't have the energy for anything more taxing. I didn't think it's Kinsella's best but fans should still enjoy the familiar silliness.decisions.<br />As long as you don't overthink it, there are some real laugh out loud moments as Lottie's and Ben's attempts to consummate their marriage are deftly thwarted by the hotel manager at the behest of Fliss including broken volume controls, intrusive butlers and a couples massage that causes Lottie to have a painful allergic reaction.<br /><br />A lighthearted rom-com, Wedding Night is a amusing way to spend an hour or two when you don't have the energy for anything more taxing.

B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Great songs, but they are repeats of other CDs with new people singing them.  Love Tom Jones and She's a Lady...but why not sing it with someone else instead of putting the same song on 3 recent CDs?
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book is fascinating.  Book One was also very good.  The facts about World War II are interesting.  I cannot put the book down.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was good but I would have preferred a different ending.  It kept me reading until the very surprising end.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Couldn't read this one fast enough. Haven't seen the movie and don't care to now because I know it couldn't live up to the standard set by the book. Cried tears of happiness at the end- very glad I decided to read this one. Unique in the way that it is told.
B008C20TDG|5.0|So much I formation and good recipes. I think it has helped me begin my paleo lifestyle. I wish the recipe sectio. We're a bit more organized. Does t seem like enough explanation on putti g hot plates together. Maybe it's just me I would recommend to others
B009GED3HS|5.0|Really funny and always entertaining but extremely realistic portrayal of the back and forth nature of love and friendship. Seeing this season you really got to see the characters mature into a comfortable place.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|One of the better zombie movies I have seen in a while!  So glad it had more of a plot!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I was hooked into this book the first page.  It is a mix of pain, adventure, beautiful scenery, friends, bad choices, redemption and courage.  It is one of the books that I finished and wished I wasn't finished yet or that I could go back and experience for the first time again.  I enjoy reading and I enjoy books of almost any kind but it is a rare experience to find a book like this.  I have this book as a hard cover, digitally and as an audio book.  If you are even remotely thinking about getting this book then GET it you will not regret it.  I do not review books often because taste is so personal but I think this book transends personal taste and will stand up to reading, re reading,sharing and reading yet again!
B001HC8516|5.0|I needed to read this book, I feel better that I did. I wish I had read it 20 years ago!
B0020TS5LU|1.0|The regular DVD edition is better quality then the Blu-ray. There are no special features. Its also in French. Not sure why this version sucks.
B0002V4SXC|5.0|Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler are tops on my list of music to just kick back and enjoy.  Shangri La is nostalgic of the original Dire Straits<br />group.  As always, Mark's guitar tone is outstanding.  Have most of Mark's vinyl and several regular Redbook CD's.  This SACD version is simply awesome!! Great dynamic range and warm, vinyl-like sound.  Too bad SACD isn't the standard for all CD's.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Mira Lyn Kelly can sure put the heat into words. Amusing when she tells her Dad he can't read any further than the Acknowledgement pages. And for those who say the characters can't be real - it is FICTION. If you want reality then you should read a documentary.
B000001FO4|5.0|I love this cd.I play it all the time.They are up there among my all time favorite band.I'm glad they are still around.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Well written as a mystery, however too much detail at the beginning.  My husband could only read 100 pages and quit.<br />When I saw it was on the best seller list and only 3 stars I knew it had to be the ending.  Authors have the biggest problem<br />closing a story.  It kept me reading - did a lot of skimming at the beginning.  It was our book club selection and it sure<br />brought out a lot of good discussion.  Consensus is there is probably going to be  another book.
B000FIMHJ4|5.0|again,anything by poison is the best.I grew up listening to these guys in the 80's too.I seen them in concert 2 summers ago.they put on a good  show.
B00A8307BG|5.0|Excellant new music from RObin Trower. I would love to hear this new release live in concert. Robin Trower sounds a lot like Hendrix playing on many of the tracks. Possibly because of the blues numbers but more in Trower's playing and tecnique style.<br />Highly recommend this one.
B000T043WW|5.0|There are reviews of Solomon that acknowledge his greatness as a Beethoven pianist. (And more besides)So he is not entirely forgotten. His tragedy was a major stroke just before he finished recording all 32 Beethoven sonatas and Diabelli var. His technique was impeccable, but there is some reason to suppose the stroke that finished his career yielded  a few misses or slurs within the cycle. Not anything like as egregious as Schnabel. Whose first recordings of these sonatas (The legendary) Walter Legge had asked Solomon to replace with a newer version. (During the 40's)<br /><br />But like Schnabel Solomon's pure musical understanding and sensitivity of touch is truly remarkable. And VERY moving. It seems his recording of the Hammerklavier is generally considered one of the very best available. It really only takes one listening to appreciate this. Probably the slowest tempo of all recordings it is stunning how Solomon keeps the line alive throughout and wrings every ounce of meaning from this huge and complex work. But, then, compare Solomon's recording of Sonata 30, Op 109, and it is nowhere near as slow as Arrau, but still able to bring out the deep mystery and poetry of this extraordinary sonata. I love Arrau. I love Pollini (sometimes). But for me Solomon had what they have and deserves to be as celebrated and enjoyed...<br /><br />We live in an age where every new music school graduate is a virtuoso with impeccable technique. Just listen to Solomon and it is clear what this technique is supposed to be in service of. Every time I revisit this recording I find something new and wonderful in the music. A genuine masterpiece...
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Excellant new music from Eric Burdon. Eric Burdon sounds a lot like Bozz Scaggs on many of the tracks on this cd. Which I admire very much. Excellant all around. I highly recommend this one.
B000WDROYK|3.0|I suppose it's an example of how enlightened the Europeans are compared to us provincial Americans but the frontal nudity and gratuitous (yes, I use that word deliberately) sexual scenes ruined this movie for me.<br />It has a great plot and story line and excellent acting but, damn, I really am not into sitting around watching other people have sex.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Excellant new music from Justin Hayward. My favorite track is &#34;One Day,Someday&#34;, great orchestra, great vocals as always.<br />Some differant type's of mixures of music on this cd, some country, techno, and as always great justin Hayward vocals and gtr work.<br />I recommend this one for all Moody Blues fans.

0312382464|5.0|I hated history in high school but as an adult I found that a good writer makes all the difference and Penman is one of the best. She makes it come alive. While I remember King John and Richard the Lionhearted it was from the movies with Robin Hood. I didn't remember his son Henry. This book series 1) There be dragons and 2) Falls the shadow , with 3) The Reckoning (I've just started this one) show the progression of kings and how the monarchy dealt with issues during their reign. It isn't just dreary facts but it shows how in the middle ages peon to nobility struggled with changing borders, finances, marriage and births both inside and out of marriage, and great big personalities. I never thought about  how hard it would be  to be a realm's ruler with a king's ability to make supreme decisions, and how his kind heart and his fears to make wrong decisions coupled with the thought that being a  king chosen by God, would make him weak. Its not necessarily good being king. People feared a weak king and Henry definitely was one! I enjoyed the development of the Wales kingdom and its struggling ruling class. I liked the contrast of the Wales culture  to the England culture along with the inter-related ruling class throughout what we now the of the European culture. Throw in the papal influence, with Templar knights, crusades, and the prejudice towards the Jews and I wished I had paid more attention in school. I can hardly wait to get further into this last book of the trilogy. You learn history, learn to love it and feel like you are peeping in on a family's ups and downs. You feel like you really know these people and forget that this actually happened! History has never been so good when written by Penman.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this game is totally hilarious. i love giving the slender man huggies. he kills me though but i see it as a sign of affection. it is kind of like a female prayingmantis; she eats her hubby's head kind of like the slenderman. his arms are sweet. not the kisser and the love notes not exactly romantic. my fav is run away. and when we meet the screen goes all foggy with love. i heart my slender man best part he has a rocking body not fat at all.

B0076DELIG|5.0|Mr. Connelly makes me feel like I am right there with Harry as he uncovers the clues that will solve the case. I get excited when coincidences (there's no such thing) start cropping up and pieces of the puzzle fall into place. This book was especially interesting to me as I live in Modesto and the case takes Harry to places with which I am familiar. There really is a John Deere dealership on Crowslanding Road, but glad to report there has been no Sheriff Drummond. Another winning Bosch book in my opinion.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I though it would be better we need a good western. It was a wast of time and money to
0385349947|5.0|While I completely understand and appreciate some of the negative comments surrounding this book, such as Sandberg's privilege, Ivy League education, and clarion call for women to take more risks, despite an environment for most women where this can have serious consequences, I still support the publication of such a book because we still need to be reminded that this is still a male dominated world.  Ultimately, and historically, it is the privileged upper and middle-class women who have the time and opportunities to bring about awareness of such issues, from the abolitionists to the suffragists to second wave feminism, and on and on.  Women without such privilege are silenced by the system, when health insurance and living paycheck to paycheck trump the desire to take risks.<br /><br />So I was thrilled to see a young woman take on such a topic, as women her age often eschew feminism and feel that things are much better than before.  Of course, many things have changed and women do have more opportunities.  A book like this, written by someone who did break the glass ceiling illustrates that there is still so much more work to do as there are so many issues that bubble beneath the surface of a seemingly fair working environment for women.  And more often than not, women who get to where Sandburg is tend to reinforce patriarchal attitudes in the workplace.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The author is really intelligent and the book is one you will read over and over again.  My husband and I turned out to both be &#34;acts of service&#34; types and we have really struggled to find a common place for years.  This book spelled it out like we were in third grade.  So simple, so effective.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Water is the next thing I need to get my farms working - but with no buckets, the only thing I can farm is cactus!  Really good rendition of the game - wish there was a press or lag gesture for moving rather than the movement buttons.  Something like two fingers for walk, three for run and you could get rid of the buttons.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The Innocent is an exciting story with wonderful characters. Within the first 10 pages, Baldacci makes you want to keep reading.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Well, this is a book about kids with cancer. Or snarky, intelligent, extremely self-aware teenagers with cancer, I should say. I mean, this is a John Green book after all.<br /><br />Here's the short version: cancer girl Hazel meets cancer survivor Augustus at a cancer kid support group, they fall in love and talk about death and morality and stuff. There is also a sub-plot about tracking down the reclusive Dutch author of a book about a teenage girl with cancer. But mostly there's a lot of talking.<br /><br />I think John Green does a great job of putting the reader in the shoes of someone fighting cancer. Hazel and Augustus spend a lot of time demolishing the cliches that surround Kids With Cancer.<br /><br />That said, there's not a lot going on here. We know how this kind of story ends (spoiler: someone dies) and the mystery to be solved is not that compelling. Also, Green has taken the character trope of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl and managed to turn that character male. The name of that character is Augustus Waters. Hazel and Isaac (another cancer kid) I found believable. Augustus I did not.<br /><br />Overall, I'd rate this book as Just Okay. It's kind of heavy in places, and it does a good job of giving us the perspective of someone with cancer, but it's light on plot and it's not particularly revelatory.<br /><br />If you want to read John Green at his best, check out Paper Towns instead.
0307341577|5.0|I love Gillian Flynn's books. I also purchased Gone girl and Sharp objects. I can't wait for her to come out with another one
1401232590|5.0|I bought two Batman trade-paperbacks recently: [[ASIN:1401207529 Batman: Year One]] and The Long Halloween.<br /><br />I read Year One first and it was pretty good but it felt like a lot of setup for a much larger story. Fortunately that story is... The Long Halloween. And boy does it deliver!<br /><br />This trade paperback is the very definition of 'densely plotted': a serial killer is on the loose in Gotham. He (or she?) only kills on holidays and usually targets the associates of Gotham's two ruling crime families.<br /><br />This being Gotham, the rogue's gallery is vast. Is Holiday the homicidal Joker? The mysterious Catwoman, who always seems to be in the right place at the right time? Calendar Man, who despite being currently institutionalized has a known propensity for date-based killings? Is it all a mafia feud? Or could it be that Gotham's white knight, prosecutor Harvey Dent, has finally flipped and gone to the dark side?<br /><br />The plot, as I've said, is complicated and you'll want to pay attention to every detail. Even having finished it I feel compelled to go back through it and put together some of the stuff I missed the first time.<br /><br />I really liked the art. Graphic novel art (for me) tends to fall into two categories: completely confusing and easily skimmable. Skimmable is better but of course then you tend not to notice the art at all. The Long Halloween straddles the line. Each panel makes you work a little bit but it almost never leaves you completely confused. So I was actually paying attention to the art and getting something out of it. And it's art worth paying attention to.<br /><br />Combine Year One and The Long Halloween and you've got a one-two punch that makes up one of the best story arcs of the modern Dark Knight era.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The best out there.  I have others downloaded but this is my favorite especially Arcade.  I'll be so disappointed when I'm completely finished with it.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|This give a most satisfying conclusion to Merlin's secrecy about being a sorcerer.  The whole series is an excellent journey with Merlin as he develops as a wizard in King Arthur's court.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I really enjoy this game even though I had to purchase ($1.99) to go to the advanced levels.  But it was worth it - I have spent several hours on it, and it is definitely a challenge if you play the adventure level while being timed.  It took me several tries to get past one level.  Make sure you read all of the info given to you how to play the game - I didn't at first so I had to finally go back and do so in order to advance within the time allotted.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|It's fun, not exactly great adult entertainment but worth watching if you're up for some mindless fun.  Really cool to see references to all the games from the 80's going forward - even a couple obvious plugs for Metal Gear Solid!

B00992CF6W|3.0|I play Mine craft on my p.c. a lot and picked this up to try. I find the program and its worlds limited in size as i  expected being for a hand held device, however i did not think they would be that small. the game is missing  some of the crafting items  like  a fishing rod and being able to mine red stone would be nice. It's OK for the basics and will give a newbie to Mine craft a taste of the game, my kids love it and it keeps em busy for a good while. Other wise I'll stick to my p.c. version.

B00BWJARHO|2.0|Peter Jackson has obviously gone Hollywood with his rendition of the story the Hobbit. It's been a while since I've read the book, suffice to say, there is allot in the movie that's not in the book, usually is the opposite. Why are we being subjected to 2-3 movies to tell the tale? I didn't find the book this confusing and Jackson seems to adding characters from the Lord of the Rings story line into the move. The dynamics of the story and pacing are not as cohesive as they could be. I watched this with my family, my wife fell asleep, the 5 year old left the room, and my 8 year old thought it was boring.<br /><br />The characters are all well acted, and the dialogue is adequate, although the game of riddles with Golum was torture to sit through,,,just can't understand what's being said.<br /><br />Not impressed at all and probably will not see the movies to follow unless they are free and there is a blizzard outside.
B004G600A4|4.0|A great remaking of the Rapunzal story--A strong female lead, great characters altogether (love the horse!) with nice development as they go along, plot is well-developed with lots of clever turns, beautiful animation. We enjoyed it very much.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|Interesting to see North(Santa) with tattoo's, the Easter bunny is a hybred bunny/kangaroo and  the sandman, as a short pudgy mute. I'll give the creators credit for coming up with a very different take on these charters, and that's really where the fun of the movie is. The plot/story is basic and has been done many times before.<br />Watched the movie with my kids age 5 and 8, needless to say they didn't get all the jokes, and were actually bored at certain parts of the movie.<br />Not bad but not worth owning.
1476734941|5.0|I saw the PBS special about this research.  This book is short and easy with all you need to know to motivate you to start this program based on the limited research in this area of fasting to remain healthy and lose weight.  It includes some sample meals to help you understand what 500 - 600 calories looks like.  For the price, I think the book is worth having.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Does exactly what it needs to.  Runs smoothly on my Kindle fire 2nd gen.  Also split screens when you go back to the home screen so you can continue watching.  This can be just as easily avoided however by first pausing and then exiting the app by closing the play mode.

B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I have this game for both the ipad and the Kindle, the game plays great in both devices when it works. But the constant crashes gets annoying. Also the game lacks support on the Kindle, there have been been two major updates for the ipad and none for the Kindle. It is frustrating since I can not load my allied bases, I contacted customer support and they don't know when they will come out with an update. For now I give the game three stars for the ipad and one for the Kindle.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I got this for an elderly friend that just can't stop watching it, Thank you<br />I would order more movies
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Upon my curiousity of how The Wachowskis and Tom Twyker would co-direct and write what I would consider a opus to the genre bending, cerebral cinema category; I can truly say this is worth a 3 hour watch.  I am not familiar with the novel but after seeing this film, I will place Cloud Atlas on my to read list.  I am a sucker for a great story and this is one of them that I truly enjoyed on a first viewing.  When I first heard about what the Wachowskis were working on I was excited because everything they do is on an epic scale- Cloud Atlas lives up to their reputation of taking the audience on a journey and leaving you with questions to ponder. If you like a film that makes you think about life, death or what we face as human beings, yet still enjoy sci-fi/action sequences, a romance and a very delightful old codger publisher and a crew of malcontent senior citizens, then you will definitely love this film.  If you are more akin to movies with more action and less dialogue and intertwining story- maybe you should skip this: but honestly if the time length of this feature (almost 3 hours) scares you off than it wasn't meant for your anyway.  That being said, the time flew by for me because I love epic films from Laurence of Arabia, to Titanic, the Abyss and The Last Emperor and The English Patient; Cloud Atlas has some of the elements of the elements of each genre of the films I just mentioned ( you definitely will notice some nods to the Matrix trilogy and a little of Lucas' Star Wars when during some of the more sci-fi driven sequences).<br /><br />One of the things I have always commended the Wachowskis for is how they incorporate African Americans/black people into their sci-fi stories back from the first Matrix film into Cloud Atlas with Halle Berry and Keith David. Being black myself and a huge fan of the sci-fi genre particularly in films ( blacks in sci-fi television has been quite well represented since Nichelle Nichols first stepped foot on the platform ofthe U.S.F. Enterprise in Star Trek.<br /><br />Well, like I said this is my first viewing of the movie, I will buy the DVD and write another review fully with a critique and make sure it's spoiler free. So far, I will give it 4 stars for story and the scope of bridging very different time periods together creating a unique and challenging theme.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|This is a review after using the product for almost a year...<br /><br />Even though this product is sold as a stabilizing handle, I use it as so much more. I move around a lot when shooting and so you are able to get super low angle shot as well as high angle shots. It is constructed of a durable plastic that in its own way slightly reduces heavy shaking. Either way I use it as a bracket system more than anything and it really comes in handy. Im adding a three shoe bracket mount to the shoe already equipped to the tail end of the handle which will hold an L.E.D panel, Zoom H4n recorder and whatever else I have to add. I must add though, the hot shoe on the front is mediocre.  Once you secure everything you WONT worry about it falling.  Overall a solid, Inexpensive investment.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Highly recommended series with great acting and writing. You'll learn a bit of history too. I am actually watching it for the second time and catching facts I missed.

B008WCP2PG|4.0|I bought this movie for my wife.  She begged me to watch it with her, which I did reluctantly .  Definitely not the movie I thought it would be.

If you are a Rod Stewart fan this CD is a must have [[ASIN:B00BQ1DBUS Time]].  If you're not a fan, you will be after you hear this CD. It's great, and as always with any purchase from Amazon, it arrived exactly when it was promised.  Everything I have ordered from Amazon has been a good experience.

B00003CX9W|5.0|There is nothing like this movie!  It's an incredible feat of Disney animation, art, music, and delight.  And guess what, no stupid characters appear in it to ruin the story like in Fantasia 2000!  Sorcerer Mickey is the exception because that was extremely well-told and the Mouse is versatile enough to not be considered a &#34;ruining&#34; element for me.  I plan on introducing this to my son in a few months and I am certain he will love it just as much as his Dad and I do.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This was based on a true story, very action packed, sad at times!!!  But a very well made movie. I have no idea how they did the effects!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I definitely busted this music out while I was doing some cleaning.  Energetic tunes, and a marvelous voice.  I'm so glad he's bringing back all these old songs from our grand/great-grand parents' generation!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Tea. 'll. You'll. Guy. They. Uh huh. Uh huh. Gr8 :-) :-). Awesome. Game I mean. Just. Unbelievable. Fuchs.great. fun Ghana tut so g teen.
0374533555|5.0|This is one of the most useful books a thinking person could read. The concept of `what you see is all there is' is worth the price of the book. Highly recommended.
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|This to me is one of the Doors best albums, the music is awesome!! Thanks for the as new condition and the fast delivery!
1595825045|5.0|What can I say? A lot of pages, interesting information about the series and a beautiful artwork. I wished it to be a much more bigger book because their work is simply AMAZING!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great to know how much charge your battery really has.  Allows some customizing, tells you when the battery is fully charged (instead of relying on the color of the power button), and gives alerts when the charge is getting low.  I find it very useful and helpful.
B004PVKFR8|3.0|It's ok. Fun album. If I were a fan of this specific group I'm sure I would love it. Only a handful of the songs appeal to me, but those songs are great.
B00005QCYC|5.0|One of my favorite movie series and even being used it was in great shape and played without a issue.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Fun to watch.  Never disappointed in Nicholas Sparks.  We've watched several books made into movies and have enjoyed them all.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After watching a couple of episodes of season 1 we were hooked.  Amazing to think that people lived like that back then but what the heck the ultra rich today live that way themselves now. The acting is first rate. The settings are out of this world.  Wanted to see season 3 right away so bad so we purchased it. Alas now we have to wait until 2014 like everyone else.
B004EIZCPM|4.0|This is not your typical high school movie.Very entertaining and actually very realistic, defiantly not your jock type movie,which is refreshing for a change,imo.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|I've been looking for this movie a long time. I consider this movie a classic & I had to have it in my collection. I was happy to see that Amazon had it available for a great price. It sure saves time when you have things like this at your finger tips. The movie is in awesome condition .....brand new.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this game for my 2 year old great nephew.  He learned it from his cousins and when I turned it on and showed him, ALL of the kids came swarming around me to play it and each took their turn and watched.  (including his Mom)...They love this game!
160774273X|5.0|This book is great! If you follow the general instructions, then your loafs will taste great. Don't fixate on the product recommendations in the book or the timing of your individual steps - you will bake fantastic bread every time! Do invest in equipment and ingredients that you can afford, it will make a difference. Good luck baking!

B00127RAJY|5.0|We love this video. I have small children and little time to work out. This video is less than 30 minutes including warm up and cool down. The actual work out is only 20 minutes, but she works you HARD, even in level 1. They also offer modifications if you are a beginner. If you want to get in great shape and you don't have much time, this is it.

193700788X|1.0|Sorry to say this book was awful...originally loved this series and the Eric/Sookie romance.... but the way she decimated the awesome Viking warrior to be a sex servant was a joke...Sookie ending up with Sam was also wrong..She should have stopped writing this series 4-5 books ago.. Please readers pick up Kresley Cole or Gena Showalter books they are fun and sexy... Long Live the Viking!!! Maybe True Blood will be better but I doubt that 2.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The subject says it all. Worth the read, especially if you know little about Tesla. It's unfortunate that the world, including Edison , was against him. He could have accomplished so much more.
B00B8SSWSK|4.0|It's hard to believe, but the synthpop band Depeche Mode has been around for over 30 years. Originally getting their start during the new wave era, the band has racked up an impressive discography. Original members David Gahan, Martin Gore, andy Fletcher and Vince Clarke arrived in 1981 on Sire Records with their debut &#34;Speak & Spell&#34;. After the release of their debut, Vince Clarke left to form Yaz with singer Alison Moyet and linking up with And Bell to form the pop duo Erasure. He was replaced by Alan Wilder and for the next fifteen years, they would release most of their best music. When Wilder became the next person to leave the band, the remaining members continued on as a trio. Their second album as a trio (following their sophomore album &#34;A Broken Flame&#34;), 1997's &#34;Ultra&#34; was a darker effort that was released after Gahan's personal demons almost consumed him. Two more albums followed- 2001's &#34;Exciter&#34; and their final recording for Sire, 2005's &#34;Playing The Angel&#34;. They laid low for the next four years and emerged with their first and only album for Capitol Records, 2009's &#34;Sounds Of The Universe&#34;.<br /><br />After a four year absence, they resurfaced on a new label Columbia Records for their next album &#34;Delta Machine&#34;. On their latest offering, they reunite with producer Ben Hillier- who was also behind the boards on their previous albums &#34;Playing The Angel&#34; and &#34;Sounds Of The Universe&#34;. As always, Martin Gore is the primary songwriter- with the exception of the David Gahan and Kurt Uenala penned tracks &#34;Secret To The End&#34;, &#34;Broken&#34; and &#34;Should Be Higher&#34;. The album starts off with the menacing &#34;Welcome To My World&#34;. On the song &#34;Angel&#34;, they sing of finding new love, while being content to finding happiness on the first single &#34;Heaven&#34;. Maturity and personal growth is the theme behind the song &#34;My Little Universe&#34;, while the ballad &#34;Slow&#34; takes its inspiration from the sound of blues rock. Martin Gore takes the lead on the song of a person settling into sadness on the melancholy ballad &#34;The Child Inside&#34;. The closing track &#34;Goodbye&#34; shows a man coming to terms with leaving the hurt an pain behind. The vinyl version of &#34;Delta Machine&#34;- much like the Deluxe Edition CD- contained four bonus tracks. The songs included are &#34;Long Time Lie&#34;, &#34;Happens All The Time&#34;, &#34;Always&#34; and &#34;All That's Mine&#34;. While it's not a great album from Depeche Mode, &#34;Delta Machine&#34; is still a solid outing from the legendary British band. Even after three decades in the music business, they have still managed to keep pushing forward.#34;Slow&#34; takes its inspiration from the sound of blues rock.

B00821OX98|4.0|I went into this show knowing nothing about it besides there are aliens.  So I'm happy it turned out to be as good as it was.<br /><br />I'm a big Walking Dead fan, not because of the zombies, but because of what the zombies have turned humanity into.  Falling Skies has a similar concept but it pulls its punches where Walking Dead does not.  Then again this show is more about &#34;hope&#34; than the downfall of humanity.<br /><br />Enjoyable, could be better, maybe it does get better in Season 2, but I recommend it to anyone with a passing interest in SciFi.
B000RJO578|5.0|REALLY FUNNY. AFTER I SAW THIS MOVIE ON TV, I HAD TO GET IT.  ABOUT A COP IN ENGLAND WHO WAS SO GOOD THAT HE WAS PUTTING THE OTHERS TO SHAME. SO HE WAS TRANSFERRED, AGAINST HIS WILL TO ANOTHER CITY WHERE PEOPLE BROKE THE LAW AND THE POLICE DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE
B005FUJNNU|4.0|I love this movie and it is great to be able to watch it in Blu-ray quality.  The sound is amazing as well.  This is a must have in any Blu-ray collection.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I think the author was over the series. I can't say it's all I would have hoped for. But it's all tied up.
B008CJ0KEM|4.0|The story is a little cheese but the people are fun to watch.  The video and sound quality are very good.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is a great game. it's a challenge and soothing. The further you go on the harder they get. A good minds challenge
B003TH14H4|5.0|Very well written show. Complete fun and great entertainment the whole series. I enjoyed the dynamic between Castle and Beckett.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I bought the kindle for my husband. he primaryly wants it for social media. He had no problem downloading the app. Its fast & easy and he's happy! That makes me happy!
B001VIMCW4|2.0|Allow me to give you the entire plot of this movie in less than 4 lines. Yes, it will contain spoilers, but it will save you a ton of time and boredom:<br /><br />1st half: Car chase --> shooting, foot chase (over roof tiles in dress shoes) --> shooting, knife fight --> stabbing, car chase --> attempted shooting, boat chase --> boats apparently having rough sex. 2nd Half: Cool tech, sleazy politician, cool tech, tuxedo, cool tech, random sex with some woman who's name we don't know. Kill off almost every supporting cast member who's name we hear more than once. Jame Bond wins and is redeemed. The End
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Beautiful music, profound lyrics, and a real sense of the presence of God. Zschech seems to be without doubt one of the best worship leaders ever.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie quite a lot, however I thought that the pace could have been a bit quicker.  I guess it's just us living in a microwave world now, but I thought that the pace was a little sedate.  Very historically accurate though which pleased me.
B003MC5N28|5.0|this book was very interesting, couldnt put it down!! i suggest this to all ages as a MUST READ! :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|The end of this book has received some criticism. I loved it. The is novel is the prequel to WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOLF.  A young George and Martha.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|It was a good book, some of the characters were really likable and interesting. I would like to read another book from the author!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was fantastic, I want more! I will waiting for more, I reccomend it, I enjoy a lot this game!
B00BESM14U|5.0|There are no words for this adaptation. For a reader who has a hard time watching my favorite books become movies, this is a must see!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I absolutely love a thrilling story, and The Lost Hero went WAY beyond my expectations for a fabulous book. I highly recommend this book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A good clean ap and its free! It is addicting and I've logged way more hours playing this than I'll ever admit to.
0786869143|2.0|The book had a sticker on it that said GOODWILL .99cents / what's up with that . this is not a good thing<br />Not happy<br />Rusty..........
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I saw this production on PBS and knew I had to have it.  When all of the Jean ValJean's sang at the last part of the DVD it was just fantastic
B000FC10QG|5.0|Fascinating.<br />Enlightening.<br />a great snap shot of Wall Street in the late 80s.<br />Great composition of characters and an entertaining read!<br />Loved it!
B00466HN6S|5.0|great movie for kids (and adults). entertainment for the whole family.  would recommend for family viewing.  quality of the movie was excellent as advertised.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play with click and drag features. Also, auto complete makes this mobile app much faster. A+ Solid App!
B00005JSGK|5.0|love the film just like i remember it when i was little so glad i found it..  Thanks again. TSmith
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Interesting to me that a series of this depth was written for young adults.  It certainly raises the question of what happens when governments are all powerful and how the citizens eventually rebel.  Even in the rebellion, all is not completely good nor completely bad but the reader is left with the hope of a better way of government.
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|love the film just like i remember it when i was little so glad i found it..  Thanks again. TSmith
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a remarkable story, rich in joys and sorrows, and told in a way that makde it hard for me to put down. This book has stayed with me long after I finished reading it!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This thing is awesome! I do have one complaint, however: the screw keeps coming loose, causing the screw covering to fall off at random times.
B000W5PIYQ|5.0|I missed a couple episodes & this was an awesome way to catch them. I was impressed with the price per episode & can watch them at my leisure.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Not quite as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but better than everything else out there.  The only thing close to it is the Game of Thrones series on HBO.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie so I avoided it at the theater.  I was recently on a flight and it was only movie, so I thought, what the heck.  If I wasn't on a plane I would have opened the window and jumped out.  This movie was terrible and the acting was so over dramatic that I was actually laughing at it.  If you want to spend some time you will never get back, go ahead and watch this thing, but otherwise save your time and money.  Do not get this movie.  It is a good thing Baum is dead, because this would have killed him.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|Battle Studies is perfectly fitting for this album's title. John Mayer does seem to be competing with himself here. The album is not bad, not extraordinary, but not bad. The songs are interesting. The melodies do outweigh the lyrics, but Mayer's performance makes this collection better than just the middle of the road.
B004G25V9S|3.0|Opeth is has some very good instrumentals  and very good muscians i am not a big far<br />I bought a prs guitar with th Opeth logo. For a lighter metal band<br />These guys are good.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is a magnificent re-working of familiar events, conflicts and old enemies with the endless potential of the alternate reality scenario. STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS surreptitiously reworks events and characters from STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN and the original Star Trek series via the possibilities of this alternate reality. This time out the cohesion of the story, the characters and dramatics are much more focused and defined, honed to perfection for this new vision.<br /><br />The story is more compelling as it unfolds when compared to its 2009 predecessor. INTO DARKNESS is aptly named. The performances of the primary characters are well defined and realized. Chris Pine demonstrates a controlled intellectual and emotional force that the 2009 script did not focus on. Karl Urban's performance demonstrates that Bones does not exactly have a \\"continued predilection for irrelevancy\\" as is seen on the big screen. Benedict Cumberbatch's villainy is brilliantly realized in his histrionic performance. As for the plot, it is a powerful one often thought provoking and exhilarating. It looks like STAR TREK is back and here to stay.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|App is constantly freezing in games causing me to lose credits, experience points, and rewards. I am so sick of it! Please fix your crappy bugs!!
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Michael Giacchino's soundtrack for STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is very dynamic. Giacchino has a flair for the dramatic yet never losing sight of the lighter side of the human psyche. He is sure to be recognized as one of the great film composers in due time. \\"London Calling\\" is a magnificent and enigmatic piece, thought provoking stuff. \\"Sub Prime Directive\\" is a rousing and powerful composition and very sentimental in its realization. \\"The Main Theme\\" almost harkens back in style to James Horner's STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, yet adds a much more dramatic and urgent tone to the composition and ultimately leads into Alexander Courage's original fanfare. \\"Buying The Space Farm\\" was very elegiac and moving. In all, this is a very good and well-drawn soundtrack.
B00B00RJJO|5.0|love Billy Bragg, saw him in Portland a small bit ago and it was SO GOOD! this album is a lot slower than most of his stuff, I think, but it's nice and chillaxy, and as always his voice is dreamy... ahhh, BB... thanks for being awesome!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|CLOUD ATLAS is an incredible film. Yet, overall reaction to this unique film was perplexing. It was just not marketed well and that is the only reason I see that it remind out of the psyche of the film-going public. That is a shame. Should I have turned left instead of right? And what would have happened in each case if I had? That is sort of the premise of this film. Are seemingly unrelated events connected or affected by each other? Perhaps so. Yes, perhaps. As the separate stories unwind, their integration into some sort of cohesive metaphysical time and space continuum is suggested. This is a captivating film and riveting in the way it challenges the viewer to feel, to think to imagine. It is a wondrous film.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|Light, strong, plenty of pockets. Holds a 17&#34; laptop, although zipping it around the corners is occasionally tricky.<br />Highly recommend.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|ZERO DARK THIRTY is a powerful film. Its subtle brilliance is evident on many levels. It is somewhat episodic, yet the narrative flow is dynamic and extraordinarily cohesive and the energy exuded is raw and energetic.  It is a story of seeking out the diabolically enigmatic elusive Osama bin Laden and what it took in time, efforts, lives and resolve to bring him to an end. Always just below the surface is the perseverance, against seemingly insurmountable odds, of Jessica Chastain's Maya. Jessica Chastain's performance is one of relentless determination to bring bin Laden's comeuppance to fruition.  For me this was a riveting film that started at a slow and deliberate pace, but gradually built to an intense and intelligent conclusion.  It is beyond my expectations.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun game, makes you think. Higher levels can be challenging. Wife and kids lie it also. Go try it.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This app is flexible and easy to use.  It comes in handy all the time.  I used it recently on a business trip to China and had no problem relying on it to wake me up even through the jet lag tiredness.
0812993357|2.0|I expected a more quality book in terms of writing and photos. I donated it to my local library. Someone will like it.
0307943232|2.0|I don't know why expected anything different:  angry lawyer upset with government and does elaborate scheme to get back at them.  Run away from life, sun shiny day.  But I liked &#34;the Painted House&#34; ...something different from him.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The puzzle is a lot of fun, but to add additional puzzles it costs more money.  Just beware so that you'll know what to expect.
0385366752|3.0|I was really into it, and then at the end, it was a let down. Readers were good, especially the female.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Nice Family watch!! We had a great time with the kids.First time we see an amazon prime movie and everything resulted fine.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|A easy to watch , love story, that even your Mom can watch with you.  Julianne did a great acting job in this one.  Simply , a good chick flick , so don't expect the  husband or boyfriend to stay awake, mine didn't.
1423134206|5.0|Its was a gift so it was amazing for her!<br />The cover was good, but the inside was WOOOW!! i mean if you like design this one must be on your library. Definetly
B0064MPXFA|4.0|4 1/2 really.  interesting and often gripping.  I like the age mix of characters -- much more realistic and unusual on tv.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this book but I truly am fascinated by her story (and had loved the fiction book Room, also about a kidnapping like this). I'm a writer and am picky about what books I can handle without getting frustrated, but her writing is awesome, and not just good for someone who didn't go to school in later years, but good for anyone. She tells her story in a simple and honest way. I read reviews of people frustrated with the space given her pets and so forth, but I didn't think the book ever stalled or got slow. She is quite thoughtful about her experience. I would have liked to know more about her daughters, but I read somewhere that she was trying to keep them out of it for their privacy, which is understandable. This answered the questions I had about why she never tried to escape, even though she was given so much freedom at the house and even was working for her kidnapper's business. It does go into detail of his sexual attacks, for those that might have trigger from it. But, overall, an excellent memoir.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Love the whole album. The ballads are powerful but the upbeat songs are catchy and easy to listen to. There's not a song I hate
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I had never heard of this book, but it was so interesting. We've all heard many, many stories of what the concentration camps were, and if you haven't been, you should visit at least one in your life. However, this was told from the point of view of a brilliant psychoanalyst, and the human intricacies he picks up on are fascinating. Half the book is about his time in the camp, and the other half are his thoughts on it. It was a short read, too.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is it for us mahjong players! possibly the very best created, or at least of what Amazon is letting us know about or is letting us download. I know of one other game, not available for Kindle (as far as I know of yet) is by Big Fish Games, Mahjong Towers Eternity, that lets you play and create your own boards. Lots more creative juices get flowing with MTE, but Amazon, as usual, is a seller, and not a thinker, and won't think about that until months have passed. I would like to find a game for my kindle fire where I could create my own boards, create my own tiles, and share them with strangers and friends. What a concept!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina is now one of my favorite women in show business. She is smart and hilarious. The book gives insider information on the shows she has been involved with, and she tells stories from her life as a working mother. She was inspiring to me to reconsider giving up my career for my baby and get more involved on a part-time basis. If you enjoy intelligent commentary, you need to read this.
B000GQXSQG|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT READ FOR A YOUNG READER.  I LOVED THIS BOOK WHEN I WAS IN MY TEENS.  IT'S AN INTERESTING STORY WITH SOME DRAMA IN IT.  IT HELD MY ATTENTION WHEN I READ IT.  I CAN'T WAIT TO READ IT AGAIN.  REMINDS ME OF THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I am editing my previous review.  The original charger did not work.  I returned it for a refund.  Anker contacted me and offered me a free replacement.  The replacement works great!
B006T5GTK0|5.0|ALICE HAD THE BEST CHILDHOOD.  SHE WAS AN EXTREMELY LUCKY GIRL AND HAD THE BEST KIDS TO PLAY WITH AS A CHILD.  WHEN ALICE GETS OLD THIS IS WHAT SHE WILL REMEMBER AND IF THE NIGHTMARES GO AWAY AND NEVER RETURN THIS WILL BE THE BEST THING FOR ALICE.  REMINDING SOMEONE OF THEIR NIGHTMARES IS CRUEL ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU AREN'T EXPECTING IT OR AREN'T PREPARED YET TO DEAL WITH IT.  I HAVEN'T SEEN ALICE IN SO LONG TELL HER I MISS HER AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HELP.  IT WAS MORE THAN I COULD BEAR.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|This is by 4th time watching it and ever time it gets more better! This movie quickly climbed to the postion of my favorite movie.
1400069807|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  It gives great information d really helps me grocery shop differently now.  Say &#34;no&#34; to sugar and salt.  Eat the right kinds of fat.  Don't let this world fool you!
B00BJENK62|1.0|I don't think this book lives up to the standard of the lonely planet franchise. In fact, there are even wrong information, which is seriously a letdown.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I didn't expect to be as interested in this as I was. I put it on for my godson, and ended up watching the whole thing with him. Tin Tin was an awesome guy! The drunk captain got a bit annoying at times, but Tin Tin and his faithful dog were both endearing and entertaining.
B0094MFITS|5.0|Tom Selleck brings back entertainment to the screen. Jesse Stone and surrounding characters pull you into the drama and don't let you down. Well thought out casting on a five star rating makes you wait with great hope for the next chapter.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|This series is excellent and it is so good to have it on my kindle. The whole series in one book is the best. It is exciting  and is hard to put down.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|The movie began at a slow pace but after that this film is realistic, funny, sad, and refreshing!!!! I laughed and cried. I ha e a feeling that people who rated this movie at lower stars do not have children or they are oblivious to the real world in your forties.
B002N44XSG|5.0|It was awesome I loved the tips I would recommend this to all people who think they might be demigods
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|There is non better than Lara Croft, I'm a hugh fan of female action flicks. Giving it 5 stars is not enough
B0026PW67W|5.0|A lot bigger than I thought but I don't care. It's so big and the paper looks like it does in the movie. So glad I bought this!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The story just keeps getting better. I'm on pins and needles, and I NEED the next book! I think this might even be better than Tolkien's trilogy. I can't wait to start watching the tv version.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Too short to be a paid app. I would have liked it more if the game had more than 4 levels.Pretty lame!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It feels like I have my own horse. I love it so much. :)  I cant wait to see what they can do when they get even better graphics and tech.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I never read so many pages so quickly!  Love the different POV story telling.  Makes for an engaging and quick read!
B005HEPOKU|5.0|I love the Star Trek Universe, and this season does not disappoint.<br />One of my least favorite episodes is the season finale however.  It consists mostly of flashback clips of the previous two seasons involving Riker.
B0064QNS62|5.0|This is a great game. easy to play an very addictive especially at the doctors office. Hope your doctors office has wifi.. cool game check it out for yourself..
B005C8ENI0|3.0|slow and boring.  You could predict almost every thing that was going to happen.  However, Matthew is always good to look at
B008RA3X5E|4.0|really cool little clock. several different features make this clock pretty handy to have. I recommend this if you travel a lot.
B008602KQI|5.0|It is by far the best book I have ever read! I read it constantly and it never gets old!

B006M4F67A|3.0|This game is ok. I have played many Mahjong games and I find that this one can be difficult but yet boring. The fact that it is harder is a challenge to me but not really colorful enough. The board is on the dull side but good news they give you hints if you click the wrong letter.
0756405890|3.0|It's a shame that the editor didn't help Rothfuss tighten things up significantly in this book's first first third or so. At several points I itched for my own red pencil, as the story got bogged down in unnecessary exposition and arcane \\"historical\\" detail. Yes, I understand that it's a trilogy, and that some of these details will probably be handy to know in Book Three; but did Rothfuss understand that the reader can only have an \\"Aha!\\" moment from clues planted here if he or she manages to REMEMBER this stuff for thousands of pages? Personally, I can't allocate the necessary brainpower. On the other hand, I would have liked more development of certain of the (non-Kvothe) characters, particularly his fellow students at the university.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Rothfuss does significantly improve in both regards (pacing and character development) in the second book of the trilogy (The Wise Man's Fear), which earned four stars from me.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Love Lady Antebellum and was so happy to see they were coming out with a new one!  I preordered from Amazon, and I like it very much.  My disappointment is with Amazon--after it came out, the price was cheaper! Not fair!!  Great songs, as always.
B00992CF6W|2.0|this app costs way way too much. if I were to buy it, it would have to be free. this is a stupid rip-off
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|I did not like the format they use to play this I thought it was the other Blockus game had play it was alot easier to get the feeling.
B00BF123WG|3.0|To be hones, the national geographic version of this story called &#34; Seal team Six -The hunt for bin laden&#34; , much better....the beginning and the end of the movie are worth watching.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|My children have fun taking turns playing this game.  I feel that the hand/ eye coordination is strengthened by playing and like that they have to watch out for the bombs and aren't just slicing away mindlessly.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|This was a great for Tom, it was nearly complete in its explanation of all characters, most characters were believable and well acted. Tom seemed to channel some of his work from Collateral, its a good movie and its worth it, a great thrill ride , pop your popcorn and get ready for some fun!
B004BOJM64|5.0|I like all the songs, I thought I would only like a few songs but I was engaged during the whole time!
B007Y6OZE0|4.0|Here are my favorite Offspring albums to date (not meant to start a flame war, but to provide a frame of reference for prospective buyers):<br /><br />1) Ignition<br />2) Rise and Fall,...<br />3) Smash<br /><br />I consider 'Days Go By' to be slightly better than 'Smash' but not as good as 'Rise and Fall.'  The highlights of the album are 'Secrets From the Underground,' 'Days Go By,' 'Cruising California,' and probably the best tune that the Offspring have written to date, 'Slim Pickens Does The Right Thing and Rides The Bomb To Hell.' The latter track is so good, it's worth the price of the entire CD. Simply, it cannot be played loud enough or too frequently.  The balance of the tracks aren't bad, but aren't great.  The 'Dirty Magic' cover is somewhat noteable, too, but a curious choice, since it's probably the worst track on 'Ignition.' Overall, worth the money.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I actually bought my daughter a Kindle & we loved it. Then I got a new phone & it had a Kindle app! I used it every single day. When I got a new phone that didn't have the Kindle app I was so upset.....until my daughter told me to go on Amazon & download it---Perfect!!! It's so convenient & easy to use. There is a huge selection of books to choose from: every genre & price range! Can't live w' out it :)
B001IYCMNA|5.0|awsome product. i recommend

1401216676|5.0|The art in this comic is superb.  I absolutely love that the colors and pencils were done by the same guy.  You get a tremendous amoutn of loving detail on every page and each frame almost looks like a cover shot.  And what a cover shot.  This book looks great on the shelf as well.
0307271080|5.0|There are so many aspects of this book that I can relate to my personal life yet it's still very authentic, bold and captivating.  It touches on so many social issues that bewilder new African immigrants and affects how we define ourselves: what it means to be black in America, assimilating into American soceity and recognizing your place in it, maintaining your Africanness, etc.  There's even more that relates to being a black woman in America: inter-ratial dating, wearing your natural hair vs processed or weaved hair, blogging, the consequences of being too assertive, etc. Like Chimamanda's other books, Americanah is comical, very cleverly and honestly written seemingly without fear of retribution, and will have you enthralled.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is a beautiful story with a very satisfying ending - it also taught much in the way of life's problems and solutions.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love to play this kind of games, I was addict to candy crush in facebook but I couldn't play on my kindle because it request Flash Player, I found this game and is just as addictive as the other one, even better because you need to collect items to build up a cute city on a tree..... Must try!

B004BQVGHK|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is amazing - did you know there is a very popular museum in Tokyo about him?  You may want to start with Princess Mononoke, though.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Movie if I could have watched it my Internet keeled freezing up.  So I give it a 1 star due to poor internet.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Love it! I want to watch every episode more than once!  They are all so very entertaining.  It is a hit.
B0041D843M|5.0|This is a well-written, accessible book that will change the lives of all who read it. A person has to decide who and what to believe in the sea of misinformation about food and nutrition. This book is the best place to start.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Fun but often freezes and shuts down without saving progress.  Good park simulator. never seems to run out of tasks.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book really grabbed me by the collar on certain points, on really how to live life with crazy passion!<br />Thanks Steve for letting the author in your world!
B00005N6KG|3.0|Sound is good. But the ear pieces ALWAYS pop out of my ear and i do mean always! They are also pretty awkward when you first received takes some getting use to.
6304711905|5.0|This has always been a favorite movie if mine. I can watch it over and over. Sam Elliot, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are great in this movie together.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Animation has sure come a very long way.  This film is incredibly beautiful.  The texture, color and depth of the scenery is astounding and the detail in all the characters is miraculous.  What is even more astounding are the characters themselves.  &#34;Santa&#34; is not the jovial rotund bearded and non-threatening old man portrayed forever by a popular soft drink's advertising but this &#34;Santa&#34; is based on a Cossack warrior and has the attitude to go with it.  The Easter Bunny is rough and tumble and an Australian.  The Tooth Fairy suffers from AADD.  And Jack Frost is not quite sure of himself.  All in all this is a great film that mom and dad won't mind watching with the kids.  Also the jumping eggs in the Easter edition were a nice touch.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|It's a great sweeper which I bought for use in our caravan.  Unfortunately with it being American it has a different electricity voltage to Australia so I had to buy a different charger.
B000002GXX|5.0|To my mind the answer is yes, although I can easily understand others going for Hotel California.<br />I have the remastered version which I think improves on a very good recording from 1975.<br />The title track sets the scene for suberb guitar work and just everything coming together with apparent ease, not far off from The Byrds Nortorious Byrd Brothers and The Beatles Sargent Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br />The overall tone is one of dark times in LA despite the band receiving great adulation and finanicial rewards for their work.<br />After The Thrill Is Gone is a good example of an attitude of wondering if riches and fame are all that they'd cracked up to be.<br />The closer, I Wish You Peace, is likely enough to have been sung to themselves as much as their audiance.<br />For me it's one of the best albums put out at any time.
1416575464|5.0|This book is so perfect. They break every room down and show you tips and tricks. I love flipping through it for new ideas!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love everything about this series hence I a an avid collector of all things English in terma of movies and tea, I recommend it obviously from the score I gave it, Enjoy!!
193700788X|5.0|I love Charlaine Harris' writing and all of the SS books. I'm sad to see that its over, but overall, it is a good book! Of course, I think most of us were hoping to see Sookie and Eric end up together. I kept reading waiting for the out of left field way for Eric to save the day and end up with Sookie. But, she ends up with Sam. An odd choice for me, especially since Eric in his own way has always had Sookies back. But the surprise at the end with who is behind the plot to kill her is very good. Its sad to see so many people hating on the book and Mrs. Harris, but I guess you can't please everyone.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|This is great to watch with a date as its romantic, funny, and passionate. It's also an interesting movie for those people that surfer with mental disorders that effect everyday life. I could really relate to the main character. Sometime it's hard to break habits or except that we have a problem we need to conquer.
B007REV4YI|5.0|If you don't mind, I am not going to rate this movie based on the previews, advertisements, etc., that I was forced to watch at the beginning of the film. In my mind, that is just wrong. IMHO, this forum is for reviews of the de facto film, video quality, cinematography, acting....<br /><br />So, on to the film. My favorite \\"Bond\\" of all time has been Connery. I loved his portrayal of Bond, just seemed perfect for the part. However, Craig is challenging that. He plays such a damn good Bond it is really hard for me to not acknowledge that he may the best 007 to date. (Of course he benefits from more modern production, effects, financing, and other factors.) Craig play a superb Bond in \\"Skyfall\\", a Bond movie that I rate at the very top tier of all Bond movies. For me, the overall movie maintains the character of the Bond franchise while injecting some new elements. Listen - the plot is pretty standard Bond stuff; Bond and / or Bond's colleagues are victims of some fiend, capture / revenge of said fiend is sought, evil and somewhat crazy antagonist enters the scene and nearly destroys either Mi6, the world, or the moon, but in the end - Bond triumphs over aforementioned fiend. What I thought made this movie carry the standard plot through very well were -<br /><br />- Daniel Craig's character<br />- Judy Dench's character<br />- Decent action without going over the top<br />- Great scenery, (landscapes and females)<br />- Ralph Fiennes entrance as Ems replacement<br />- Whoever the dude was that played \\"Q\\" was pretty decent for the character<br />- Javier Bardem always plays a great creep - (No Country For Old Men - wow!)<br />- Naomi Harris<br />- That girl. You know which one I'm talking about, in the casino and later with the Whiskey glass on her head. Yeah - that one...<br />- The movie has an \\"Atmosphere\\" to it. (For an atmospheric movie, check out Heat -  [[ASIN:B002AH3WSS Heat]])<br /><br />So, I am a fan of the current Bond franchise and will follow the future closely. (I was not so crazy about the last movie. That, my friends, is another story...)<br /><br />For all of the above reason, I recommend this movie. The quick review - THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE AND YOU WILL PROBABLY LIKE IT.<br /><br />Now - the crap. I was forced to sit through many (seemed like about 20) promotions and previews before the movie. The problem is that these anal orifices (is that right for plural or is it orifi?) at MGM have decided that we cannot just buy a movie for 20 beans. We get the added bonus of watching promotions for other MGM stuff we do not necessarily want! Shame on you MGM! I will hesitate to purchase future MGM releases.closely.

B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|this movie is about reincarnation through out time, and how people are linked and interact in each incarnation. It follows a select group of humans and events. My family did not enjoy this show because it appeared chaotic and disorganized, flashing the viewer in and out for a brief scene and plot of each incarnation of the group of people. the closer to the end of the show the quicker the switch of scenes and shorter. The overall film plot did not become clear until nearly the end.  It was a long movie to sit through.  The many different disguises and characterization of the actors as they played in each incarnation was the most interesting part of the show. I'm glad we didn't pay full movie price and waited until it was on video. It was a disappointment and a waste of money.
034554398X|5.0|This series is awesome. It just gets better and better book after book! This book follows season 3 of game of thrones. There's lots of shockers and cool twists revealed from the 1st 2 books. Any fan of the tv or book series will thoroughly enjoy this book. Can't wait to read the next book. Although be warned season 3 doesn't follow the book exactly. I must say though that reading the books is great and you get a clear picture of what is to come later on.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|The book was a fast and engrossing read.  I enjoyed the way the story was told along with the historical context of North Korean politics woven in the narrative.  Highly recommended.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|I rented this the other night spur of the moment. It is a great film with a really great cast.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great no that showed the human side of my idol Steve Jobs. May he rip. He said it best. Don't listen to your customers, show them what they don't know they want.
193700788X|2.0|SPOILER ALERT,<br /> To be blunt, this book was boring, poorly written and felt like she was trying to cram every bit player into the \\"last act\\". You know when an old cancelled TV show, like Happy Days, gets back together for some lame 1 hour special show, that's what this felt like. I think it's interesting that so many people are suprise at the ending. I told my book club 6 years ago that this is the way the book would end, I feel like she was setting us up from the first, \\"you should see him unload a truck with out a shirt on...\\" or \\"I could always trust Sam.\\" But I was suprised on how she so unceremoniously had Eric walk into the (boring) sunset! Now that was a crime. For all the air time that so many uniteresting and bit players got in this book you're telling me this was the best she could do after giving him top billing for most of her books? She spends a lot of time(filler)talking about how to wash and dry dishes. Too bad, the first 8 were great, Good Bye Sookie.... Sorry you and your friends had to go out with such a whimper.
B008XTVWHK|5.0|fun and done well, reminds me of a better time when sex was not the main idea of a monster movie.
B00932A4XE|5.0|There were so many funny parts. Totally relatable if you had a baby. And the Australian girl is hilarious I love anything with her in it.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I have seen the screen adaptation and television story of Les Miserables many times,but none can top Tom Hooper's musical. I couldn't wait until Amazon had the DVD. They delivered it as soon as it was available. I love the songs and the actors singing live.I have played it so often I practically know all the words. It will always be my favorite.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I've tried Sound Hound and Shazam beats it hands down!  It's super simple to use and it picks up on the songs WAY faster!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Read 1,2 and 3. On book 4 now if that says anything. So funny. I laughed till I cried. Great book to read too your kids. Just the characters in the books, so real. A definite recommend.
0743435753|5.0|Another in a fine series for those who want the good guys and good gals to win, but understand it isn't easy.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Love the Diary of a Wimpy kid. This book was the second in the series. So funny. Love reading this book to my kid. We are on book 4 now, if that says anything. If you want to laugh. If  you need to laugh. You will laugh so hard your socks will blow right off. A definite recommend.
0765348276|5.0|I can understand why this is an award winning book. Its a military space novel about \\"ground pounders\\" -i.e. Soldiers. I can relate to that.  I like the flow and the introduction of new characters. Really enjoy Scalzi's sarcastic sense of humor that creeps in every so often. I also like the fact that Scalzi didn't kill off all of John Perry's new friends.<br /><br />Liked it enough to buy THE GHOST BRIGADES (OLD MAN'S WAR), Scalzi's second book in the series. Looking forward to learn more about Jane Sagan.
B009NG1Q96|2.0|The Elite seemed more like an extension of the Selection to me, the story never really went anywhere...I read the entire book in one day and now Im left waiting another year to find out what happens...ugh...
0802473156|5.0|My husband & I really like this book & buy it for those who are getting married & any friends that could use encouragement in their relationships.  It is a constant book that we like to revisit throughout our marriage for encouragement as well.  It has been a great blessing to us.  I highly recommend it!
159420411X|3.0|This is the sort of book undergraduates should read before they take any course about forecasting methods or probability. It is a shame that it is more commonly used the frequentist statistical approach to test hypothesis rather than bayesian one. I have realized that it is bayesian approach the one that is utilized in finance and economics, so there is no point in spending time learning the faulty frequentist approach.<br /><br />This book manages to give us the tenets by which we can improve our predictions... although I am skeptical about predictions -the kind of person that goes &#34;Suspend the judgment&#34;-, I think the world could be better if forecasters endeavor to improve their predictions. Nate makes an excellent job telling staticians that statistical forecasts are not enough to make good prediction... that is what this book is about, not confusing the signal with the noise, i.e. correlation does not mean causation.<br /><br />In few words, this book is worth your time.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Its so easy to turn on at nite when I need and its very bright. Lights up the whole room too love it!!
B005IQZB14|3.0|This was an interesting story and I learned a lot about backpacking that I may or may not ever need. Pretty much a story about one screwed up womans summer trying to \\"find herself\\" while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail after her mother dies and screwing up her marriage while attempting not to whore it up while there (which she fails to do. Not sure how one summer hiking fixed this womans mental issues but I would love to see a picture of her horrific feet she kept talking about.

B001AITGWE|4.0|Falling Down is that rare 90s film that feels dated (in a good way), and keeps you watching and wanting to see more and more, because deep down, aren't we all just wanting to go on a little bit of a rampage?

B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|Firstly I must say I am so grateful that CH has stopped writing any more Sookie Stackhouse novels.<br /><br />Oh, I'm sorry that I will never have another enjoyable adventure with some original characters, but I am so relieved that I will never read another piece of work that oozes resentment for the characters, the public opinion and the general task of writing the last instalment.<br /><br />I am fine with Sookie not ending up with Eric. I'm fine she didn't get placed with Alcide or Quinn. But why on earth did she end up with a brother like character? It felt borderline incestuous with her best friend/boss/business partner putting the moves on Sookie and bedding her when we have had no literary foreplay! We have had 13 books to build up the pairing of Sookie and Sam and CH chucks it in at the end and then publicly announces \\"Oh, I was always going to do that\\".<br /><br />Really, anyone but Sam would have suited me. I was begging for Bill by the end of it despite all of their history, but it was wishful thinking. However, that wasn't the main reason I didn't like the book.<br /><br />There were editorial errors abound through out the book, which really irks me when I have paid money for a professionally published hard copy. It makes me feel that little thought, care or consideration went into the construction of the book, and no one else cared enough to fix it.<br /><br />It really was a farewell story to all the characters who ever entered into Sookie's life. We had random encounters, phone calls, visits from some regulars and visits from those completely useless to the plot - because, well, CH can.<br /><br />I'm finally getting to the main point that peeves me off the most about this book. If I wanted to spend the day hearing about Susie Homemaker reading emails, checking messages, getting the mail, picking tomatoes and every other mundane task a person can achieve in one day does, I would call my GRANDMA!!! I don't want to read chapters about how bored she is and all the stupid to-do lists in her head, what a waste of words and potential story line!! Pages and pages of useless writing, which I have come to believe is a picture into the everyday life of Charlain Harris. I can completely see her writing about herself, and to be honest there have been plenty of reads over the last 13 books that have made me feel like Sookie was more of a Grandma then a 20's chick.<br /><br />And to finalise, what a wayward plot! Lets get every living (and I did expect her to raise a few dead too) villains and haters of Sookie and get them together to destroy/ruin/kill poor Sook. Who cares if they don't have a reason, who cares if they were prisoners in a Fae realm completely sealed off to entry or exit (I'll fix that right up with a letter blooming off a fricken plant) and somehow get them to all meet up and join forces and fail??? Really? That was the best she could come up with?<br />As I said earlier, I didn't mind that Sookie didn't end up with any of the favourite contenders, but what I do care about is a VERY weak story line with unrelated plots and twists that lead no-where....Poor excuses for peoples actions (possession, daughters love, cluviel dor, HIV psycho) and murky scenes against character type is unacceptable!!<br /><br />Why bother?<br /><br />I guess CH had a contract to fulfil, and no one specified how good it had to be to meet obligations. I understand she was bored with the story and tired of fan hate but if your going to do something, you may as well do it right OR DON\\"T DO IT AT ALL! I apologise for the shoutiness. I just don't believe there is any reason on earth to produce poor work and expect people to pay for it, and if you do, you should be prepared for the audiences reaction against the work.<br /><br />So with that said, like others I say you should read the book, but DO NOT pay for it. Borrow from a friend, or hire from your library, but please save your hard earned dollars! I needed to read it, for closure, forhope, for regret, for possibilities and I wasn't satisfied. But I had to read it to find that out for myself. I lived in hope CH would give us a beautiful farewell to a much loved story (Sookiverse) but she didn't deliver.<br /><br />So I finalise this review with my own ending:<br /><br />Sookie, having been scorned by all the men she has loved, decided to walk away from Sam's advances. After all, men come and go, but a true friend lasts a lifetime.<br />Claudine's money had finally cleared, and thanks to Claude Sookie would be receiving $3000 a month for the rest of her days. With that in mind, it was time for a fresh start - or at least a well deserved break. It was time for Sookie to make her own adventures and live without fear. Maybe some travelling? Of course Oklahoma was off the itinerary, but the world was waiting for her to discover it.<br />After Jason's wedding, Sookie asked Sam to take her home but declined any further intent. After watching Sam leave from her Kitchen window, she went upstairs and started packing. An hour later, Sookie left a letter for Bill on the kitchen table asking him to watch over things, then she walked out and climbed into her car and started driving. She drove down her long, lonely driveway and turned the opposite direction of Shreveport. With a smile on her face, she kept on going, and never looked back.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I love the storyline and Robert Downey Jr., in all very well he play this character.  I look forward to the sequels and many more stories from the marvel comic books.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|I have read many of Stephen King's books and enjoyed them thoroughly. I still have nightmares about The Cell where I am convinced that I may become a Zombie if I answer my cell phone when Unknown Caller is calling me. Now after The Long Walk I may not be able to sleep for fear of being given a Warning and ultimately a Ticket if I cannot maintain a pace of 4 miles per hour. And for some reason I keep downloading Stephen King books but dreading the aftershocks.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I really enjoy these Dash games, I am slightly addicted.  This one is as great as ever and challenging too!
1594746168|3.0|This book consists of two parts. The first being the 'biography' of Dr. Spencer Black, an odd bit of fiction told about an imaginary doctor and his life. The second part consists of the anatomical 'drawings' by the fictional doctor of mythical creatures.<br /><br />Although the drawings are somewhat interesting, I must confess to not really 'getting' this book. It tries to come across as somewhat of an art book, but then again not really. And the fictional biography was a little silly.<br /><br />Three stars for the drawings...the rest of the book is silly.
B007AL48UK|2.0|Quick, easy games, fun tiles, have a similar game on my computer, easy to play on my kindle,when I have some spare time .
B009MB682W|5.0|This collection includes what I assume to be remastered tracks of all of the original Bond hits plus some of the new ones.  The only song that I missed with this collection was the Adele song from Skyfall.  That song is available as a separate track.  Buy them together, and the collection is complete.<br /><br />These are great songs to pull out for movie-themed parties!
B008J2GAKU|5.0|I am going to keep this review short, sweet, and spoiler free.<br /><br />Mr. Snyder has crafted an awesome new chapter in Batman's history that I am sure will be remembered for years to come.<br /><br />With the introduction of the Court of Owls we have new group of villians that certainly appear to have the ability to push Bruce to both his mental and phsyical limitations. The Court has very deep roots in Gotham's, and Bruce's, histories and they are not going to let him stand in the way of their plans for Gotham.<br /><br />At the start Gotham appears to be Batman's city. Bruce even says as much, but we soon learn this is not case as Gotham belongs to something much older and more powerful than one man. Even if that man is the Batman.<br /><br />If you're a already a fan of Batman there is absolutely no reason not to read this gem.<br /><br />If you're new to DC or Batman comics then the New 52 run is definitely an excellent jumping off point, but I feel that the Court of Owls requires at least a passing knowledge of the Bat's history to fully appreciate his city turning against him. Not the people in it, because that has happened before, but the actual city itself.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is hilarious - literally laugh-out-loud material.  The first time I read it I was on a cross-country flight and couldn't help but errupt in laughter periodically at the expense of my seatmates.  I gave my hardcover book away to a friend.  I enjoyed it so much I recently bought it again for my Kindle.
0425263916|5.0|I loved the first book and cannot wait for the final. Haven't had time to read this although I'm sure it's good!
0670014893|4.0|I love Le Carre's books for their brilliant dialogues between well-drawn characters but even more for their imbedded veins of moral outrage.  The author writes as an increasingly offended observer of government leaders focused on protection and expansion of personal privilege through questionable partnerships with private supporters/sponsors whose goals are generally money-focused.  From what I can see of how these arrangements work (and have worked for years) in the U.S. and Europe, Le Carre is rarely off the mark.  Although there is often a bit of exaggeration in the telling of these moral tales, including \\"A Delicate Truth\\", these are stories that need to be told, and told often.<br /><br />\\"A Delicate Truth\\" tells the not-so-unlikely story of a dodgy anti-terror operation organized by a British defense official.  The attempt at terrorist rendition is to be carried out by elements of mercenary security companies but goes quickly south when the intelligence that sparked the operation turns out to be flawed.  What follows is an attempt by the righteous participants to atone for the collateral damage inflicted during the failed rendition, and by the principal organizers and their institutions to cover up the failure and protect tattered reputations and privilege.  Discerning the shades of good and bad/honorable and dishonorable is central to the story as is often the case in Le Carre's books.  While this is no action thriller, there is an intelligent plot and fine character interaction in \\"A Delicate...\\"  It's a good read that could have been (in my opinion) drawn out a bit more and given even more depth.  The latter observation is made by a total Le Carre addict, so take it for what that's worth.<br /><br />John Le Carre continues to give his audience meaningful writing that informs and entertains.  May his moral compass operate freely for a long time to come.
B0091REZMW|4.0|only complaint is you need friends to play in order to advance. otherwise its fun and challenging. if you have patience you don't need to spend any money on the game unless you want to buy energy and diamonds.
B000000OPQ|5.0|If you ever want to get pumped up or just want some great music to listen to this one can't be beat!
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|A somewhat predictable plot but entertaining.  I liked the drama and I liked Mark Wahlberg in his role.  I would see it again.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|It was good. Like it came, and I opened it played it, it worked. It was good so, yep. Yep
B000NY12LO|5.0|Great Book!  Makes you see the other side to school shootings. I would recommend this book to anyone involved in education or have kids.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|This is first rate television.  AS good today as it was in the '70s.  Timeless.<br />Quality programming.  Characters worth knowing.  A real keeper<br />Downton is the only thing in its category
B00BF11STU|3.0|I wanted to watch this movie because of a  the hype it received. I found it interesting but not suburb. In my option very close to new report.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best of the bingo games out for the Kindle Fire.  It is fast paced, has great powerups, and I look forward to playing everyday.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|a fun game with authentic images and play; it is enjoyable; a good way to pass the time and use your brain matching the tiles.  try it
B0083RNWE8|4.0|What a wonderful way for families to choose various activities that will help their mind & bodies feel good together!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I could play this for hours it is fun and interesting to play. I colud play it for hours at at a time
B005WUHAX8|1.0|After following the directions EXACTLY, I put my iPhone in the case and within 30 seconds, water had seeped into the case and damaged my new iPhone. I have insurance but it comes with a $170 deductible.  PLEASE save your money and put your phone in a ziplock bag if you need water protection. Anything would be better than this crappy phone case. I'm literally sick to my stomach after using this product. There's not enough bad things I can say except that it's a HORRIBLE PRODUCT...TRUST ME AND DO NOT BUY THIS CASE!!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I enjoyed this game it is relaxing and fun. That is why I  gave  it a 5 star rating I play it for a long time
B000QK7YQ2|5.0|I saw this movie when it first was released and through the years have watched it over and over. I think Bruce Brown absolutely captured the essence of motorcycling as a sport elevating it to an art form, which I believe most motorcyclists think it is anyway. Total entertainment that captures both the fun and seriousness of 2 wheeled transport. Highly recommend!
B00BBA6FMU|5.0|I am still reading The Kitchen but I am loving the book, would most certainly recommend this as a good read
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good writing, that kept my interest, with a ending that has you wondering how you would deal with that situation.
B009POHHR6|5.0|I'm not normally one to read comics but I saw this and got a little intrigued, basically I am so glad I bought this!!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|One of the most beautiful books I have ever read. Full of pathos, deep literary and artistic insights and triumphs of the spirit.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|We have so enjoyed this series. Many times, a series starts out great then runs out of ideas and soon has everyone sleeping with everyone else in order to create story tension. A tiresome cop-out. The Good Wife continues to intrigue and entertain with an underlying &#34;real life&#34; consequences story development. We look forward to season 5.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|very lovely movie, with inspiring results.  Beginning is a little dark, but as the movie develops, it became very inspiring.  I loved the movie.
B00BSW29OE|5.0|Once you start reading, you cannot put book down!!  Accurate as far as history is concerned...Author does a wonderful job describing what happened to the people of Hiroshima.  (from Japanese point of view)  A must read for any WWII fan.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|Nonsense.  No imagination in scripts.  Corrupt cops, drug dealer scenarios, general lack of originality.  Pure 5 star bull***t.  Crap, crap, crap, crappity crap.
0062502174|5.0|Excellent book and very insightful.  Well worth the payment...an investment in insight.  Thoroughly recommended for anyone who wants an easy read with valuable knowledge
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|.Well to begin it is a fun game but it glitches my son was playing it and some how it lost his park and reset I had invested 50$. In the game for him then it did it to me I invested over a hundred dollars in my game.  I'm very upset with this game and wouldn't recommend it to anyone to invest Money in this game
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the game works great and reveals bits of the movie but doesn't spoil it. try it because its free and is well made
B005OP2928|5.0|I always love these. They are funny and light. Also, these stories are very current. I would recommend to anyone.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Attractive, well made, functional and too bright to lose!  Seriously?  Eleven more words required?  Last review for me! OOPs two more....
B003ZFCBJ0|3.0|it's okay. The acting wasn't the best. The story was fine. Not sure I would recommend it. I wouldn't say it is Miley Cyrus' strengths
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I downloaded this game for my 11 year old daughter, and ever since, she cannot seem to put her Kindle down.  She loves this game.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Of course, everyone knows this is terrific. I wish there was more character development as there is in the book.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|my sister got this app on her kindle yesterday andshe loves it and I want to get it but its taking litterally 3-4 min to download and I didn't have enough memory so I had to delete something and download again and it still didn't work so I got rid of two other apps and I'm waiting to see if its enough room wish me luck...<br /><br />PS. once I get I will probably love it though!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love the game. It helps me calm down and its just fun. if you are new to this you should buy it.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|It's a little violent for younger viewers but I loved it and after my Husband watched an episode with me he went back and recorded the previous ones so he could catch up.  Can't wait for next season.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is an great quick read.  A nice summary of the life and times of the greatest inventor in human history.  I really enjoyed Sean Patrick's writing style and take home message.  Finished in two sittings and it left me inspired!  Thanks for sharing your work with us for free Sean!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Read it when first published, rereading now before going to see movie.  Still feels like a gut punch, but i had forgotten how elegant and visceral the prose, how spirituality infuses every corner of Pi's consciousness.  can't wait to see how the movie compares.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I like this one better than the first three..Play it all the time. GREAT GRAPHICS! GREAT SOUND EFFECTS, WONDERFUL GAME!
B00127RAJY|5.0|whenever I need to get back in shape, i always go back to this DVD. the workouts are great and help keep my joint nimble.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Loved this movie seems to run in line with a lot of what history depicted that transpired during his time in office. Definitely recommend it.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This book was interesting and it made me think a little. What if magic was real and science dismisses too many things. So many things are unexplained and this book explains i
B005OMOKN2|4.0|Works as advertised, however, I wish it lasted longer.  On a recent vacation, I averaged going through about two batteries a day.  Would be nice if Nikon released a more powerful battery.
B004WR125O|4.0|Works as expected, however does not seem as powerful as I would have hoped.  I purchased this unit with the Onkyo TX-NR509 Network A/V reciever and out of the box it does work...  (Had to select my network and enter my wireless password of course).<br />A little disappointed in the signal strength from it though.  I have a Wii right next to it and it recieves full signal strength for wireless, this seems to average 60 to 80%) signal.  Tested using pandora and was a little spotty.  Was not real expensive so will keep it, however will look into running cat 5 cable to reciever for a faster and more reliable connection down the line.
0783222149|4.0|I love anything Streep is in..........!!!...........but had to be &#34;in the mood&#34; for this one........but she kills them woo hoo
B005HEGW56|5.0|Out of all the Star Trek series I've watched, Enterprise is by far my favorite. Great characters and interactions, with interesting relationship developments. The stories for each episode were interesting with lots of action. T'Pol is my all time favorite character. She played an awesome Volcan, and the challenges she faced with an emotional crew was well told. I wish this series had gone on longer. I liked it way better than Next Generation, and even more than the original.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very informative and eye opening. Information one will not find on local TV.  I see food, especially processed food, differently.  Worth watching.
B00260HH3K|5.0|Just like the animates, this movie follows them to the &#34;T&#34;!! Action packed and not a boring moment!! KOOL FLICK!!!!
B0067TQQI8|4.0|This is the second Anker I have purchased, as the first one died after about 1 year of use.  I use it nearly daily, as I go about my business.  Considering the heavy use I give it, I'm impressed with how well it is holding up.  My only real complaint is how the charge level indicators seem to be inaccurate.  They tend to indicate full or 3/4 full charge for a VERY long time, then drop rapidly through the lower levels to no charge.  Very difficult to know when the charge will be done.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|Will appeal to anyone interested in the history and everyday life of citizens of the Roman Empire and anyone interested in the devastating natural phenomenon that tragically took the lives of so many in 79 A.D.  Harris' main character is (cleverly) the &#34;aquarius&#34; - the person in charge of aquaduct planning and maintence. This character gives us insight into events in the days before the volcano, and Harris allows the character access to both the normal citizens and the leaders (i.e. Pliny the Elder) of the time involved in the event. The story line is compelling, the characters are well developed, and the dialogue is crisp.  The event surrounding the eruption of Vesuvius really take life. Enjoyed it thouroughly.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This movie exceeded my expectations based on the first series of J.R.R.'s beloved stories.  This movie has incredible production value, and is what one would expect for it.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I really liked the film, even tho I have not read any of the comics. The ending seemed a bit abrupt.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|It started out a bit slow for my taste, but when it picked up, I couldn't put it down. I thought I had the mystery figured out, but I wasn't even close.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|This was a great game... I got it for the free app for the day. But all of a sudden most of my restaurants were locked, and it had not been 24 hours! All of them weren't locked before, but I only have 7 now. AMAZON PLEASE FIX THIS!! Or whoever does the fixing stuff. It is a fun game otherwise, I really enjoy it. I don't have money to burn by buying the restaurants that suddenly locked...  :(  PLEASE fix this!! It's a great game otherwise!  This mishap also happened to my sister, since we share accounts I thought it might have it do with that.....  :3
B00003CXBK|5.0|It's exactly as described. I received it promptly after ordering it and am satisfied. It was a fair price for an amazing movie.
B000ZP6MIY|4.0|great shoe that i can wear to work and not worry about slipping. Not as good as the old airwalks i had but they don't make them anymore. so these are the next best thing for comfort
B004SBX112|1.0|I have tried to open this app and cannot. It will not respond to the instructions given. I just purchased it today May 16th,2013 and it is worthless to me. I also cannot find helps that works on my Kindle.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Its very simple game and I love it, easy to install and I do recommend it 5 stars game and product
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I was specifically looking for a &#34;book club&#34; book so I did some online research and Gone Girl kept coming up. I took a punt...and was not disappointed! A very contemporary dramatic thriller, Gone Girl ticks a lot of boxes for me. The two main flawed characters draw you in. Does contain swearing though, just saying, in case anyone is easily offended.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I guess I'm just used to playing it on the Xbox<br />Controls were different. And you can't play anything other then creative mode.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Dawson assigned adding Ghana Jun have how unrated how how his husband hurt young dat an awsome game a th BBC violin GreG how how g
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Not about Lincoln but the 13th amendment. I like DDL but this is not his best job and I don't think it was award winning material.  Very disappointed.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a great book. You should read it if you are looking for a great book to read on a rainy day!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Title says it all.  Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb whose teeth were black as night (filler).
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|I am not a Rock fan (as an Asian) but I really enjoyed the movie itself.  The story and those actors/actresses are wonderful.  I felt I became part of that era.  The songs are great and even &#34;re-sing&#34; by the players at the movies they are still great songs (and they actually performed well).<br /><br />This is the reason why I bought this CD - which I haven't done so for many years since the digital age!
B004UID2LC|1.0|On the Kindle 7&#34; HD Fire.  You will need a magnifing glass to make out what is being presented.  I don't use it at all.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I like that there are pop culture references to the &#34;Twilight&#34; series and that this series has its own mythology.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It was worth the money. It is not a short game like most. I would recommend this game if u like search and find games. It has a good story line to play along with.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Just like the TV PBS show.  Brought back many memories of watching the show.  Just which I could have had the DVD of it too.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book is very well written and I enjoyed the read.  The characters are well written and the story kept my attention.  I would recommend this book.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I am just learning about the piano guys and this is a nice compilation of their videos.  Nice to be able to watch and learn vs going to youtube and searching.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|These are not even well-written romances.  The writing is amateurish, and the story is forced.  Not my kind of thing at all.  Not sure what the mass appeal is, but if I am looking for a romance to read there are way more well-written and well crafted books out there.  If you want romance, try Nora Roberts or zillions of others that are established writers who know their craft.  These are just verging on trashy and are poorly done.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|All in all, I like this series.  It's a bit too preachy at times like when they meet with the hunters on the planet and talk like humans have evolved past things like that.  but all in all enjoyable.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game it is awesome you have alot of armor to unlock so you will have something to do and its very addictive.
B000063DHK|5.0|SCREAM FOR ME LONG BEACH!!!<br />FRIDAY MARCH 15, 1985<br />I WAS THERE, BEST MAIDEN SHOW I HAVE SEEN!!!<br />A MUST OWN FOR ANY MAIDEN FAN!!!
B008220AVW|5.0|This movie showed the real Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, as well as highlighting her great music.  very good! Don't miss out on this one!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|great acting. awesome detail, lighting, picture, sound etc etc but its obvious a ploy to build obama up. things hes said and done are almost explained through the movie in some fairy story because it dont believe half the things are accurate....but overall a movie thats DONE WELL and yes i will watch it many times again
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great film! Followed the plot of the book faithfully, so glad they got Ian Kellerman to play Gandalf again and so glad Peter Jackson is directing and that they are making the book into a trilogy, so they do not miss the pertinent details!  Cannot wait for the next installment.  A great addition to my Lord of the Rings library of DVD's.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|This application works fine. I'm able to tweet and read tweets effortlessly. This app works great for the Kindle Fire.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Very in depth history of the band and the inner workings of their career.  I really enjoyed it.  Interviews with everyone that has been in the band and from my limited knowledge they didnt seem to pull any punches.
B00008J2PG|5.0|I saw this movie years before my son came to visit.  We scanned the channels that night, it was on & I told him it was great.  He said he was not a Gregory PecK fan (he was of a different generation & had not seen many of his movies) & we watched it as there was nothing else on he wanted to watch.  He was &#34;glued&#34; to it, loved it.  That's why I bought the DVD for his b'day.
B001EN71CW|5.0|One caveat to my title: If you dislike sci-fi, space, fun and exciting storylines, or well done but not overdone special effects... then maybe you will be disappointed by this series.<br /><br />But if you like anything mentioned above, why the heck not watch it on the most recent format?<br /><br />Alright, I lied. You will probably be disappointed that this is the ONLY season ever made, as we all are...
0393072231|5.0|great book and very informative. goes in great detail on how the events happened and why we are in this mess
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I have always wanted to read this book but never had the time.  I am glad I finally did.  I can relate to this story.  It is the immigrant mentality that you want something better for your children.  That is a good.  Easy read.  Finished the book in less than a week while nursing a new born and caring for my toddler.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book is dark and twisted like Gillian Flynn's other novels and, like her other novels, is a total page-turner.  It is hard to believe this is her debut; the depth of character and intricacies of plot are impressive.<br /><br />I have 2 small children, so I thought it would be difficult to read about 2 murdered little girls, but the book is not really about that - it's more a trip through some very sick and dark minds, totally fascinating.<br /><br />I thought I had the who-dunnit figured out about 2/3 of the way through, but there was a twist at the end that I did not see coming. Wicked fun!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Would recommend to everyone !  Highly energetic and entertaining !  Live shows Rock !  Good for all ages !  Definitely follow them in the future !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is like Temple Run but more updated it has way better graphics and  should get it it's free give it five stars!
B0037QM8YA|5.0|I found this movie Good however I found that it took watching it a second time to  really find it a Excellent Movie! It is a very heart touching story  that is so honest and true!  The main theme is how a young Mother will fight to be able to raise and love her infant son! Highly Recommend
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I first read the adventures of huckleberry Finn and realized that was the sequel of Tom Sawyer and was drawn to it I couldn't stop picking it up and I'm twelve!
B00B2QA646|5.0|I like this movie. I like Keira Knightley. and there is beautiful clothes and wonderful music.I want to review this movie.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|Cost nothing and that is what it is worth, nothing.<br />Same puzzle all the way through. Only way to win is to tap the screen madly to beat the timer.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I didn't keep this app maining because I found it a pain to turn on my screeen and to have to shut off the alarm.  I watch netflix on my Kindle a great deal and found that if I forgot to turn up the volume before I shut it off for the night I couldn't hear the alarm.  Cell phone was much easier.  There's nothing wrong with the app it's just not for me
B005Q1W10A|5.0|i bought this for my wife and she absoutley loved the series and cant wait for the next series to come out
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|For free you can't beat it.  If you like iron man  you have to get this game.  Works great on my kindle fire HD
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|was a gift for the wife per her insistance and she loved the series and cant wait for the next series
B001K3EXTA|5.0|This is the best version of the &#34;Gatsbys&#34; that are out now.  The casting was perfect.  The era of carefree abandon is caught on film from the beginning.  Even as the actors sweat in those beautiful mansions, beautiful clothes & beautiful sets makes it all more compelling.  The ending is handled so well...This is the version to watch.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the detail to the Era... great costumes... quite witty at times... recommend it to anyone looking for something to watch!
B008B8A9V8|5.0|A wonderful knitting resource that I love having in the Kindle format. I always have it with me, and can easily find the best technique for my current project, wherever I am.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like the game but it's just too sensitive.  The slightest movement of the device and I'm toast.  When the ape is close, it's really hard to see past it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|My 9-year-old daughter really likes this game. We enjoy playing these together. I have several of them on my Kindle Fife.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I enjoy angry birds. I enjoyed this game. Sometimes I miss some of the birds to release...then I realize it is me getting older and not the game
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This is a cute movie the entire family can enjoy.  My kids decided to download it for a plane ride.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Somewhat formulaic romantic comedy, with the exception that both of the main characters have some &#34;issues&#34; to deal with. I really wish the ending could have been different from the typical &#34;into the sunset&#34; but the performances were strong (especially by Robert deNiro - who I thought played someone who had his own issues in a really subtle but convincing manner). All in all a decent way to spend a couple of hours.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have to admit I watched half the first season before it dawned on me that this is just a soap opera set in early 1900's England.  The second season leaves no doubt as you have characters with amnesia, temporary paralysis, and &#34;was it muuuurrrder?&#34;<br /><br />It's great television though, gives a great insight into the time period and lifestyle of the wealthy Brits.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My wife and I have really enjoyed the series as a whole, so far. The first season (only six episodes) was a little slow, but seasons two and three are really fantastic. Don't be fooled: This is not really a show about zombies. This show is about people dealing with a nightmarish set of circumstances. The characters are well-developed and we see them evolve over time. There's depth not suggested by the title. Great series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|As a big horse fan... yes city girls like horses. I on the other hand love them, so this is great!!! Yes it could use some tweaking like the other reviews have stated, but all in all great game.
B007QVLKI2|4.0|I don’t know what happened to me in 2012, but i missed this CD!  I am so glad that i found it now! I go to bed singing “dirty paws”, dream “mountain sound” and wake up singing “slow and steady”  If ever there was a collection of songs that just makes me happy, this is the one! It’s swimmingly easy to fall in love with Nanna Brynd&iacute;s’s vocals and the way that Raggi’s vocals mesh; it’s incredible!  &#34;Little Talks&#34;, is of course, amazing, as is the video! The music is full, bold, and somewhat complex without being overwhelming. Of course, there are a couple of songs, that i can’t identify with, but i still enjoy the entire collection.  I want more! More of anything they have released, but so far this is all there is, So,<br />So Terribly Sad! So enjoy this for now, and hope for more!
B0036R92V2|3.0|I read reviews of this film claiming it to be far better than Sergio Leone's &#34;Dollars&#34; trilogy but when I saw it myself, I was somewhat disappointed. Its not the film it said to be. I was expecting a film superior to Leone's but it just seemed too flat to begin with. The photography was too grainy, the dialogue was amateurish  and the action seemed forced without any merit. Nero's character tries to do another Eastwood but falls flat, almost laughable. I was so glad it ended when it did.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wonderful series -- couldn't stop watching -- both my husband and I have watched every episode - can't wait for the new season.
B0012GMX3I|5.0|I love this CD and have for 20 years...it is my workout music...it motivates me to move!!  I love it!
B004UID2LC|1.0|I have no idea if this works or not, so don't take my low rating as a statement about it not working... It might, I just haven't used it yet so have to rate it according to my favorite apps and not so favorites.
B000067QMD|4.0|These disks fit into the Avent lids and allow to seal the bottles for storage. They are helpful and work just as advertised. I will mention though that I can't stand how the Avent bottles require that little ring before putting on the lids. I often forget to put on the ring and all lmy precious milk pours out of the bottle. Fortunately the newer Avent models no longer require that silly ring!
B002N44XSG|5.0|Amazing action packed book with many different adventures. It is great that it incorporates Greek mythology in the book, so young readers can lose themselves in an epic adventure!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and could not wait to read the entire story over again from Travis's point of view! I wish the author was a little more descriptive with what the characters look like.
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|It don't matter wat cd i listen to by lil wayne all of them are great cuz he is the best rapper alive i am one of his biggest fans
1451695195|3.0|It goes into a lot of information about the medical side of his problem and not a lot of information is given about what he did experience, just that he couldn't really describe it, and what he did say he said over and over and over again with not much new.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|It's hard to stop watching, especially the two part episodes. The two worlds are intriguing, but sometimes they are confusing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The annimation of the horses is incredible - whoever developed it must be a horse owner!  This game is a lot of fun to play.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|If you like action and adventure, and you enjoy seeing many characters that are so interesting..you'd enjoy this movie in the series as well. The computer generations, and the background scenes were incredible. The movie really brings you in.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Very good graphics. But a pity that it is time consuming : even with an hour per day caring properly for your \\"horse\\", going levels without spending real money for purchasing coins & \\"gems\\" makes it impossible to compete with richer riders & horses! Bare in mind that only coins & gems allow you to move on in the game by upgrading to next level. And there is no  true way of earning free coins or gems! -Too bad ! Worth playing a month before quiting.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|GREAT MOVEI!<br />This movie was fantastic. You will enjoy this one..<br />Loved this... Made you feel as if you were in that boat with the tiger at times...<br />Totally enjoyed this movie.. Tell your friends!
B00BFBSV72|5.0|My daughter LOVE it and play sonic game she play it everyday and never stop and its really fun to play.
B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|Not only does he steal most of his music, but he makes good stolen music worse somehow... You've already wasted enough of your life actually listening to will.i.steal on the radio, dont put your money in his pockets for stolen music.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Stupendously the best! This is one of those pick it up and don't put it down games. Pick this one up!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game. It is fun and addicting. Your restaurant is so customizable and there are so many options.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved it.  Great adventure, and per the name of the movie, she is Brave.  Would watch again and again.
1574214276|4.0|This book is really nice; even more so now that I had it spiral bound at Office Max! Definitely something I do with any &#34;pattern&#34; type books I buy.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This was my first experience watching a video using Amazon Prime but it will not be my last. I was interested in seeing this movie but not enough to pay to see it in the theater or buy the DVD.<br /><br />The movie itself proved to be more interesting than I expected and also longer. It was the typical good triumphs over evil scenario with a predictable finale but was entertaining none the less. While some of the technology used seems far fetched science fiction, I suspect some of it already exists and more will in the future. As I was watching it I had some flashbacks to the move Truman whose life was also a reality show. I also thought of &#34;big brother&#34; who is always watching us and in the case of this movie plot manipulating our experiences.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is worth seeing but be prepared for a longer than typical experience.
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|This series is pretty great.  I thought Rick was kind of a pansy at first, but his maniacal side is starting to ease out.  Good purchase.
0802473156|5.0|My husband I bought this book to read and discuss together before we were even engaged.  I think it should be required reading for all couples.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I'm not happy at all with this purchase.  I think Accu needs to change it's weather source because it never seems to be correct even the day before.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I was surprised to find out that this book was free. It's great marketing by the author because the content is superb. I have been interested in studying great minds, like Tesla, and this book has definitely sparked further interest in creativity and exploring the world around us. I  will be buying the author's other book, Awakening Your Inner Genius, when I have time to read it and look forward to learning more about history's greats. Thanks Sean and keep up the great work.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice, big buttons that fill up the entire screen.  Looks great cosmetically and of course it's accurate.  Glad I purcahsed it
B0044KI79S|5.0|My family has loved Supernatural since day one and the show never disappoints! It's always fun and interesting and always throws in some twists and turns to keep you wanting more! Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are awesome! They are never boring that's fer sure. If you liked any of the first 5 seasons, you will LOVE this one as well!!
0545265355|5.0|This was a really great series adn I definitely see why they made it to the big screen.  Katnis is awesome and hot adn the plot is one of a kind!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|i like the game but it has too many issues. i use on tablet i always get error messages which means i can't play. i haven't played in two weeks. done the update. no results. ready to delete because of the issues. i wish you would work out the issues.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Works fine for what I needed it for.  I'm able to track and find my files easily with this easy to use application.  Good purcahse.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The Good Wife is like a book you can't put down. I've been obsessed with this show ever since I decided to try it because it was in Amazon Prime. It is so good, there are many days it is my sole motivation for getting out of bed at 4:30am to work out (I watch on my Kindle while working out). Dont let the fact that its a network show dissuade you from watching it. The writing and acting is top notch. 5 stars well deserved.
B005LAJ23A|4.0|This series is pretty great.  I thought Rick was kind of a pansy at first, but his maniacal side is starting to ease out.  Good purchase.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Love the om noms!  My daughter can't get enough either. Looks like we're gonna need another kindle to handle the cuteness.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Definitely refreshing in the post apocalyptic genre.  Very interesting characters, but the first 30 percent of the book was quite borning as the Deputy and Mayor took a week to get down the staircase.  Hurry up already, will ya!  Not a bad book.
0307744434|4.0|I've been wanting to read The Night Circus by Erin Morgentern since I read all the fabulous reviews after it's release. I finally found an excuse when it was picked as one of this year's reads for our neighborhood book club. Several of my friends read it before I did and whenever I asked what they thought they would respond with comments like \\"The imagery is amazing.\\" I wondered if it would be one of those books full of amazing imagery and lacking on plot and characterization.<br /><br />I was a bit bored by the book I was reading earlier this week (going back to it now and I'm hoping it gets better) so I picked up The Night Circus instead. I was almost immediately entranced by the images created by words and a magical, enchanting world and I realized why my friends chose to describe it as they had. However, I was thrilled to also be intrigued by the mysterious plot and the unique and quirky characters. Admittedly, there are many characters and it was often difficult at the beginning to make sense of the various characters and time periods in the different chapters. I was relieved to know that many of the characters didn't even know what was going on.<br /><br />Two rival magicians pit their students against each other in an elaborate duel of strength and skills. Their venue is the newly imagined Night Circus that enchants audiences around the world when it suddenly appears outside of town and opens its gates and wonders when the sun sets. The challenge between the two will entangle the entire circus and become even more dangerous when they fall in love with each other.<br /><br />I have a soft spot for the purely creative--the book that tells a story no one else has told in a way that no one else would even think to tell it. The Night Circus by Erin Moregenstern is as imaginative and delightful as the one where patrons enter black and white tents filled with wishing trees and world made of ice.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|HATE having to write an amount of words for a review when it was only a one song download.  Good song though!
B00CATSONE|5.0|What an amazing little book - the author's skill in communicating so much information, using relatively few words , is quite unique. I may not be a genius, but I do know a good thing when I see it. I definitely would like to delve into a few more of Sean's work !  A must for the enquiring mind!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|loved the finale to Hunger Games. It was great to see everything all sorted out in the end. Although the story is told by Katniss, I did think that she was a bit self-centred and dramatic, but still loved the book.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have been playing Mahjong fo some time know  love this version ,and plain to play for s long time
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A dark but intriguing novel dealing with North Korea. Makes you really appreciate your freedom. Parts can be quite disturbing but the dialogue is outstanding.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I had tried so many diets that did not work, and I worked out like a madman and actually gained weight.  This book connected the dots and made total sense of why what was recommended and what i was doing was never going to work.  I purchased this book because i entered a low carb weight program and dropped 32 pounds in three months and this book was one of the books sitting in the lobby.  This book is very informative but not too scientific that you get lost in the scientific arguments.  In fact, it is fascinating for the history of low carb studies and the medical experts poor arguments contradicting the health benefits of those studies.  Taubes admits that more work needs to be done on the benefits of low carb diets not because of a lack of convincing data but because many medical doctors still advocate a diet of too many carbohydrates and that is a serious problem for a society with epic obesity related illnesses. If you need to lose some weight get this book.
B002ZTQVGQ|2.0|Sorry, but after the sterling trifecta of Mononoke, Spirited, and HMC this is like some kind of nicely animated Saturday cartoon show with a lazy plot and uninteresting characters for my own mindset. I could not identify with anything in this film. I give it 2 stars because some of the animation is great and I like the water color palette I just can't stand the story or the characters. You might do better.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|You cant go wrong with this app..a must have..I haven't had any problems..no complains..everyone needs this one..download and google away :)
0689835604|5.0|Great book for infants, toddlers and pre-schoolers !  I have a granddaughter on the way and I know we will share many hours sitting together reading this book....and many others I have bought off amazon !
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I am a ebayer so this is a must have for me and I haven't had any problems & no complains!
0307200477|5.0|I am 51 yrs. old and I had this book as a child, and I bought it for all three of my sons when they were young.  It is such a classic for infants,  toddlers, and pre-schoolers.  It came in a beautiful box and was much larger than it used to be.  Can't wait to read it to my granddaughter who will be arriving shortly. In short...YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS BOOK !  I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|It is a challenge to keep me focused, especially with TV shows.  The Good Wife, kept my attention through each episode.  Found the cast to be appealing and very well played.  I am eager for the next seasons to be on Amazon.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|this series is sold as a trilogy but isn't and the forth book isn't available.<br />Well paced series with several character lines that are easily followed.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My wife and son both play this game, we are all addicted. It's fun, easy to learn and I find myself logging on often to check on my dinosaurs. Sometimes it does get a little laggy, but usually it's fine. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys sim-type games.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|It was not as great as I expected it to be.  Great cast, but the story wasn't very interesting to me.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Steven Wilson claims he was inspired during his remastering of very early King Crimson releases to approach this project. Hooray!!!! I have followed Steven since the first Porcupine Tree release found its way across the pond. He has always shown the ability to capture that balance between lyrical melodies and instrumental excursions that were the bread and butter of the early prog bands. He has also demonstrated interest into other genres during his journey and this release is also sprinkled with the best of those. In the end, however, this recaptures all the energy, atmosphere, and spirit that made &#34;progressive rock&#34; rise above the pop music machine (for a short while) to show that a small ensemble can create &#34;large&#34; music. I was forever saddened when prog &#34;discopeared&#34; from the mainstream (or perhaps it got punked). Steven Wilson's musical ship still sails (and conquers) those waters. Thank you Steven!
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Absolutely great movie.  I enjoyed the story and the actors were great.  I thought it deserved every award it received.
0399226907|5.0|Wonderful story for young ones. Illustrations are great. Nice size board book for little hands. Would highly recommend for anyone.

B000002O5L|5.0|tom petty is awesome, one of his best albums that he has put out in my opinion, its a classic
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a fun way to pass the time, sometimes it can become very addictive! I would recommend it to friends and family.
B008RTE09S|4.0|The clean-up on this movie is fantastic.  It's hard to believe that parts of this filmed largely on a 16mm camera.
B00278U1W0|5.0|For all those that love his music - it seems that all of his concerts are a musical success .<br />Coming from one of the greatest musicians of our time its not a surprise but what we came to<br />expect
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Can relate to it wholeheartedly. Very attached to the characters. I absolutely loved it. I wish there was more; I couldn't put it down!
B00417HV14|5.0|Now this is what i call entertainment ! For stuff like this was the blue-ray meant<br />I couldn`t ask for more !

159562015X|5.0|Used this in consultation with a colleague who verified the findings. I appreciate the affirmative perspective on one's traits. Take who you are and use it for good!
B006M4F67A|4.0|It is quite good.  I'd have given it a 5 if ithere were more games on it instead of just the 3 shapes.
