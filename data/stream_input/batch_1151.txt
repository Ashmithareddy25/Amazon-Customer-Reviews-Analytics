B003YOZNBU|5.0|BROLIN IS THE PERFECT TWISTED COWBOY FOR THIS COMIC BOOK MOVIE- The Story Makes Complete Sense-So Why All The Haters Out There-This Movie Is 100 Times Better Then Half The Stuff That Hollywood Puts Out Today. Yet People Would Rather Stay Home And Watch Another Boring Episode Of Two And Half men Or Survivor-Get Real This Movie Rocks!
B000WCSBQ6|5.0|works great.  Needed these to fit a variety of small devices.  You can never have enough of these on hand.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|Bought this for a quick and easy sharpener, and it does the job. Doesn't make a lethal edge or anything, just a workable edge that lasts for a few days of use. For the price I cant complain too much, and the size is great for throwing into a gear bag when you head outdoors.

B003L77FYS|5.0|I'm relatively new to Castle, as I just started watching last season.  But it has rapidly become one of my favorite shows on television.  There are so many elements that keep me glued to my tv week to week - from the palpable chemistry between Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion (Beckett and Castle, respectively), to the incredibly witty script, to the bro-mance between Detectives Ryan and Esposito.  I believe that Season 3 is where this show really hit its stride - nearly every episode has the right amount of intrigue, intensity, and humor.  For me, the best episodes of the season were \\"3XK\\" (episode 6), \\"Last Call\\" (episode 10), and \\"Knockdown\\" (episode13).  Also, \\"Knockout\\", the season finale (which aired last night as of this writing) was one of the most gripping season finales I've seen of any show, period.  I can't wait for Season 4!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This was an excellent depiction of the downfall of the US economy, the real estate market, and the job scene!  It is a movie that should be required in all high schools and colleges to remind young people that the ones in power do NOT know what they are doing!  The crisis in the financial market was not Democrat nor Republican driven; it was driven by greed and capitalism at its worst. Again, it should be required for everyone to help them understand and (hopefully) become outraged enough to educate themselves further!
B003Q6D27S|5.0|i am satisfied with the DVD i orderd. it is used but like new, it has a little writting on the DVD package and a little writting on the DVD as well but it it plays without a problem. i am very happy with my product!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is an almost perfect app to use when Pandora is acting up or you are looking for something different but good.  TuneIn let's you browse radio stations from around the world and stream them right to your phone over you data connection whether it be 3G/4G or Wifi.<br /><br />I love this because living in NM, I miss my Baltimore, MD rock station 98Rock and this app allows me to listen to whatever is playing on the station.  I also found most of the Hip Hop and R/B stations out of DC. Once you find them, you bookmark them and they are there for you next time you run the app.<br /><br />For $.99, you just can't beat that deal.  I think I even saw some HD Radio stations floating around so there's that too.<br /><br />Great dev team.<br /><br />They don't haver EVERY station.  I mean, you can pull down radio stations from the UK right to your phone!  Believe it or not, radio hasn't died yet.  Apps like this, are keeping it going.
0670022411|1.0|Book started out great.  But fascinating plot of witches, vampires, mystical books and spells quickly turned to a very long drawn out book.  The remaining book never lived up to the beginning and became more disappointing the longer I read.  Getting near the end of the book I realized there was not going to be an exciting conclusion like most books.      Basically this book appears to be a lead in to another book in the series.  The book ends leaving questions raised in the first few chapters unanswered.    It is a very, very, VERY, long book.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Just plug your camera into the adapter and plug it into your iPad. Your pictures will pop up on the screen and you pick the photos you want to download. It really is just that simple. I was concerned when I read some of the other reviews but I had NO problem at all!
159420229X|5.0|I found this to be a very interesting book.  I am not sure how practical many of the techniques are with memorizing useful information that I can use in everyday life, but I think the general concept of visualizing things and making some sort of connection with other things that are already in your memory is a good one to know and that it can help you remember useful information - like names, etc.
B0034G4ORM|2.0|This movie starts out suspenseful and dissipates into a wanna be Black Hawk Down type film. Where are the Aliens after they attack? No idea, because you barely get to see one for longer than 10 seconds. Other than one that gets shot, it's just all war and shooting scenes with nothing else. Yelling, giving orders, no character development, although it tries. This movie is such a mess it's like it was spilled all over the screen, (or editing table), and no one could clean it up. Was so rushed they just shoved it out there like a dog given his food. So basically very little thought or effort went in to planning this film. Stick with Skyline, Independence Day, War of The Worlds, and the upcoming Super 8(should be awesome), along with other \\"good paced\\" Alien films. Yeah like Aliens, the best ever(wink). As one guy said from the poster it looks great, but mark our words, the movie just plain stinks. Not sure what Aaron Eckhart was thinking, he's a great actor, and sticking Michelle Rodrigez in this, as with Avatar?? Big mistake.
B00003CXA2|3.0|I didn't dislike Forrest Gump, but I didn't really like it either. I only review it to note my atypical experience. For me it just was. It was Ok. I'm 'conservative' and supposedly this is a conservative movie. At least it's wholesome, and some of the counter-culture figures on the show are held up to be less than perfect.<br /><br />A friend of mine noticed something odd about this movie. He says the film is simply about the day dreams of the kind-of dumb character in the movie, Forrest Gump. He's just a regular guy, kind of dumb, I guess, and he imagines all this stuff could have happened to him, probably while day dreaming. Perhaps his fantasies begin early in the movie at the point he's being chased down by the bad kids. Whether this is true or not (the basis of the movie being Forrest's day-dreams), I donno, but it is possible.
B003UESJH4|5.0|In addition to the superb acting, this movie taught me the value of patience and persistence.  It also gave me an accurate account of history.
B0006L0LOS|4.0|I really liked this movie. I tend not to be a big fan of these comic books turned movies but this one was pretty good. The Spiderman movie was really good also. I can still hear Spiderman's uncle saying 'with great power comes great responsibility'. Spiderman 2 tried to continue this and I could almost hear Spiderman's aunt and the advice she gives him. The only reason I review Catwoman is to note my odd opinion that it's pretty good.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I love this movie and I love the Harry Potter series, both the books and the movies.  Some would say this movie was boring, but I thought it did an OK job of following along with the book and gave great story line to build up to the finale. I do wish they would have kept Dumbledore's funeral the same as the book though. Other than that, this is a movie worth watching and definitely worth adding to your Harry Potter collection, assuming you have one! :)
030745455X|5.0|When I first read [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] I was so impressed. Here was a very unique book written by a MAN who seemed to be genuinely sensitive, understanding and empathic to women who have, far too often in history, been the victims of violence from anything emotionally/verbally, physically and sexually abusive at the hands of their significant others to being brutally assaulted sexually and murdered by serial killers who they had never even had previous contact with. Stieg Larsson really got it!  Oh happy day!<br /><br />This book, a sequel to the abovementioned novel, is EVEN BETTER if you could believe that were possible. It gets down and deep into the life of a one Lisbeth Salander who early on became the victim of sexualt assault, falling through the cracks of an inefficient and overburdened child welfare system in Sweden only to be sexually assaulted again. Much as something like this could happen in the United States,she is labelled and discarded as a psychopathic lesbian Satanist while such \\"pillars of society\\" as judges, police officers and journalists run free exploiting women from Eastern Europe deceived into the sex trade. Of course when three individuals are found murdered, one of them Salander's former guardian who had sexually assaulted her previously, it is automatically assumed that Salander is the perpetrator. How reminiscent of the more intelligent, skilled and resourceful women in history who the minute they showed ANY backbone in their own defense they were often labeled \\"witches\\" and it was justified by \\"the system\\" to have them burnt at the stake!<br /><br />I am not done reading the book, have only completed 398 pages of the 630 it contains but I was compelled to write this review. I have been a social worker for 32 years many of them spent working with victims of domestic violence. It bothers me that churches do not spend more time praying for the victims of violence both women and children and instead spent an inordinate of time praying for the \\"rights of the unborn\\". What about the rights of those who have already made it into this world? Do THEY not count?  Anyway here's to hoping Salander has a happy ending at the end of this book. At the point where I am at now she seems to be in a great deal of trouble based solely on circumstantial evidence.ime praying for the \\"rights of the unborn\\".

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Portman IS the movie. So, fortunately, she did a fantastic job of playing the neurotic Nina Sayres who is descending into madness throughout the entire movie. Don't miss the parallel between Nina's life and the story of Swan Lake. It's more than just the ending.
0307272702|5.0|I have had the opportunity to review the work of Taubes and found it refreshing and much needed. As a clinician with a master's degree in clinical nutrition, I have been sharing and recommending his line of thinking for over 30 years. What I found interesting are the people who criticize his work. Although everyone has the right to express their opinion the truth of the matter is what happens when one \\"applies\\" this work to sick patients. Considering I have treated thousands of patients with outstanding objective and subjective improvement, this is proof that the common nutrition paradigm will continue to leave millions of suffering victims.  How does one explain the dramatic improvements both objectively and subjectively when applying this work. These are the same people who followed the dangerous present nutritional paradigm.  I sometimes wonder if any of the negative comments are from people who have actually put this work through a real clinical trial or if there unfair comments are there comments alone.  I also challenge anyone to be certain they understand the Kreb/Citric Acid Cycle before they jump to false conclusions.  All in all, the world is better off with the work of Taubes and I look forward to reading more of what he has to say.
B002WY65UQ|5.0|As a St. Trinian's fan since the Alistair Sim films of the 1950's, I know I am biased but it really is a crime that the second St.Trinian's film with Colin Firth and Rupert Everett is not available on DVD in NTSC/Region 1.<br />Yes, it is totally and completely silly but it made me laugh out loud and the scene at the Globe Theatre in London with Colin Firth and Rupert Everett doing Romeo and Juliet alone would be worth the price of the DVD.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Enjoyable and literate supernatural romance that displays great scholarship and grammatical craftsmanship. Makes a welcome diversion from the standard kick-ass heroine supe-romance or the barely disguised harlequin romance variant of supe-romance. Looking forward to the next installment of the series.
B004QPOVF0|1.0|AC/DC is always Great.  The Band gets 5 Stars.  The Editing gets minus 5.  I cannot understand why they let these Morons mess up something great with their idiotic editing.  The flipping of scenes every four beats is totally distracting and irritating.  It takes so much away from the content.  I just leave the TV on and go in the other room and listen.  They may as well have made it a CD.
B004GYNPL2|2.0|I'll start by saying this seems to be the best password keeper I've found.  The interface is relatively clean, and it's very configurable - it doesn't lock you into some developer's idea of which and how many fields each entry should have.  It uses higher-level encryption than any other program I've looked at, and it syncs with your desktop - something only one or two other apps do.  It's also relatively inexpensive with a one-time purchase fee instead of an annual subscription.    That would all be great if it weren't for some pretty inexcusable drawbacks.  First, you can export your password list in order to move it to another device, but inexplicably the program exports to a completely unprotected .csv file!  It's not even an option, there's just no way to encrypt the exported file.  How you can develop a program that is designed to encrypt and protect data, then force users to export that data into a clear-text file is just beyond me.  Even worse is the fact that you can only connect to and sync data between your phone and computer if you install Apple's Bonjour service.  Are you kidding me?  This is what makes the app nothing but a bad iPhone port.  Hey guys - I bought an Android phone for a reason!  If I wanted to have to install Apple software on my computer I would have bought an iPhone!    Bottom line is, no thanks. Don't force me to expose my password data if I need to export it, and don't force me to install Apple software to connect to an Android phone.  What a shame.
0061743526|5.0|I noticed another reviewer here mentioned an all-time best legal thrillers list. I'm not sure whether I've seen that list, but I thought I might do my own. However, I thought I'd include some classic crime thrillers, because thinking about my favourites many readers might in fact consider them to be more crime thrillers. So some of them are purely legal thrillers, some purely crime, and some crossover between the two.

B00008GKEG|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I love this DVD set and have played it many times.  It is without question the most detailed account of the history of the Beatles.  But, there are a few major oversights.  One such detail is the absence of commentary by Pete Best, the original drummer.  He has never told his side of why he was replaced by Ringo Starr (we only hear the views of John, Paul, and George on that subject), or his experiences as being a member of the Beatles.  Also, the anthology never mentions the Casbah, which Pete's mother owned and was an early gig for the Beatles.  Another missing detail is that Astrid Kirchherr, the woman whom fifth Beatle Stuart Sutcliffe left the group for, doesn't give any commentary, not even a voice-over.  She is only mentioned in passing.  Both of these people were important figures in the band's history, but the anthology does not give them their due credit.  The anthology also ommitted two of the major controversies that concerned the Beatles.  The first controversy is the original Yesterday and Today album cover where the Beatles are seen as sadistic butchers who are smiling in a sinister fashion while they dismember dolls.  This album cover obviously terrified EMI and Capitol executives, who ordered that it be replaced who one that was more wholeseome.   The second controversy is, of course, the false rumor that Paul was dead.  Yet, no one seemed to think that either one was important enough to include in the anthology. In summary, the anthology should have given us the whole picture, warts and all.  It would have been more honest that way.

0307279189|5.0|As an aspiring newbie runner, a coworker recommended this book to me. I don't know that I'll ever be an ultra-marathoner, but this book was so entertaining and so inspirational, I finished it in a week (and I'm a fairly slow reader). The book is filled with interesting characters, almost like a \\"Fellowship Of the Ring\\" of hardcore runners. What I took away from this book was what I needed to get myself started in my own running adventure: speed is not important; endurance is. If running becomes too much like work (to paraphrase the book) then you're working too hard at it. Run for the sheer exhilaration and joy of it.
B004QKNXIQ|2.0|I consider this movie to be the \\"dumb blonde\\" of the Disney princess saga: pretty to look at but lacking real substance. This movie had 90% positive reviews on Rottentomatoes.com, so it peaked my interest. I was sadly disappointed. This movie is what I like to call \\"overrated animated\\". I even took my 15-year old sister to see this movie, and even she hated it.    The movie isn't SO bad that it should be missed, but it's a pretty standard movie. If it were anything else, it would be tolerable, but this is a DISNEY PRINCESS movie. This isn't just a pedigree; it's a genre of its own. Disney has always been the biggest name in princess movies because they have offered us many of the best. It's not just that they are prolific but also crafted. Tangled was just playing it safe and thus offered nothing new to the experience. In fact, one could say that it is a rehash of other Disney princess movies.    The love interest is a thief, not a prince (Aladdin). The princess is taken away from her family at a young age not knowing she's a princess (Sleeping Beauty). The male and female leads hate each other first but wind up falling in love (Beauty and the Beast and any other romance). The story is incredibly cliche and predictable. You have a crucial misunderstanding that leads to \\"the potential split\\". You have thugs that \\"don't dream of being mean\\", much like in Shrek the Third. The one cliche that really ticked me off (as well as my sister) is the magical tear. I won't tell you who gets it, but you can guess. This deus ex machina has been done to death, and it's always silly and trite.    Because this is a Disney princess movie, the filmmakers saw it fitting to write new songs for it. Every song is forgettable and unnecessary. There is no cardinal rule that EVERY DISNEY PRINCESS MOVIE NEEDS A SONG, but at least those that do have at least one memorable song. In fact, it doesn't contribute anything new to the princess genre. Let's look back: Snow White ate a poison apple. Cinderella had the glass slipper say she was the one. Sleeping Beauty had the spinning wheel put her to sleep. All had princes save them. Then came the Disney Renaissance. Aladdin had no prince. In fact, the movie may have made fun of it with the whole \\"Prince Ali\\" schtick. The Little Mermaid had a princess who is a mermaid falling in love with a human. Beauty and the Beast: the prince was an actual beast who falls in love with a village girl. Hell, the Princess and the Frog had the prince and princess turn into frogs and becoming human after marrying and kissing. What does Tangled offer? the hair? It's not symbolic enough.    However, as I have said, Tangled isn't so bad that it should be missed. Despite its massive faults, it does have some positive qualities. The animation was pretty and creative. Disney knows how to mix and match the colors and make some really nice scenes. The scenes where Rapunzel and Flynn go to the kingdom look really good. The voice acting is pretty good despite the songs. Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, and Donna Murphy all match their voices with their characters. There are a number of entertaining scenes, especially with the horse Maximus. That horse single-handedly (or hoovedly) stole the show every time it was on screen. If only it was on screen in every scene.    Bottom line: Tangled isn't awful, but it doesn't help that everything good about it is offset by something bad. The voice acting is good, but the songs are forgettable. The animation is pretty, but the story is ungodly formulaic and cliche. There are a number of entertaining moments, but there aren't enough to make this movie entertaining on the whole. The fact that Disney focused more on making a successful princess movie and less on making a good one is really annoying. Tangled offers nothing that the other Disney princess movies haven't. It's not one of those Disney movies that will be remembered.

B0041OJ0Y8|1.0|All these reviews are obviously from the band and their friends because THIS IS THE WORST ATTEMPT AT MUSIC EVER.  I've listened to 1000s of CD probably and this is soooo bad!  Maybe this is cool if you're in a hut in South Africa and never heard anything from outside your village.  Seriously.... this is the saddest attempt at making music that the human race has ever produced.  The rapping(?) is hysterically bad and I get better beats out of my Casio keyboard from 1982 on auto-rhythm.  These guys don't sound like anything out there because people have enough taste to tell them that it sucks before they record it.  Damn... I'm really speechless.  This was so bad.  So very very bad.  Very bad.  Did I mention this was absolutely horrible in every way?  God damn this was awful!<br /><br />FYI In case you didn't get the message this was the worst album I've ever listened to.  These guys blow.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My baby loves this binky! It has taught him to hold on to things as well. I like it because I can kind of 'prop' it up on him when he is laying down, and it stays in his mouth. Great quality and very cute! You won't be disappointed!
B001F0WXY0|1.0|Ridiculous pricing here.     Get an Amazon.co.uk account. Change your Kindle Registration to the address of a friend in the UK. Buy the SF Masterworks Kindle edition of Dune for £4.99 ($8.00 US)     This is what I would do if I didn't still have a paperback version of this book handy. Does it violate any policies? I don't know. But I certainly felt violated when I saw Penguin's price for this e-book.
159420229X|4.0|I found the book extremely interesting. Especially the techniques dating back so far in time. What's more is that we sheepishly go along assuming we have bad memories.

If you truly appreciate the \\"Life/Planet Earth\\" series on Discovery this should be in your collection, especially if you have a nice High-def TV and Blu-ray player. The details are spectacular and even though the length is streched out the pure appreciation of nature and Life will never seem long enough. If you watch this for its sheer beauty and perfection I would definetly invest in the Blu-ray version, though the DVD version is ok as well. Thanks.

Is there anyone doing quality control? customer service? customer satisfaction????????????????????. We will see how long it takes to recieve a reply about this.
B004UUKD6W|4.0|Please note this album review is comparing CD editions and not focussed on reviewing the music.<br /><br />Although this is Queen's third album, it is arguably the first 'Queen' sounding album. Don't get me wrong, my favourite album, \\"Queen 2\\" had all the typical Queen elements but was more a progressive rock concept album. \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" established their creative musical stamp, Brian's guitar solo multi-tracked sound, the intense theatrical vocal harmonies all align and is more accessible to a casual listener. Of course included in this album is their first major single, the Novello award winning, \\"Killer Queen\\". For casual listeners, this album is close enough in style to \\"Night at the Opera\\" to not be completely surprising, and for Queen fans, we know this as our `undiscovered' masterpiece.<br /><br />I have bought the deluxe version which includes an extra EP with 5 additional tracks. I will refer to this later.<br /><br />Like the \\"Queen 2\\" (2011 edition), I am impressed with the whole new package. I love the scarlet red lettering of \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" on the pristine shiny white pages of the detailed booklet. Although the cover photo doesn't seem any different to previous editions, the booklet includes 6 additional pages of great black and white photographs of the lads. Like I wrote for the \\"Queen 2\\" review, this packaging befits this classic album rather than the standard cd box and generic pamphlet in the 1991 CD. And of course what thrills any music lover are the words that say: \\"This 2011 version has been meticulously re-created using the finest modern analogue and digital technology from the original first-generation master mixes.\\" Yes, forget packaging; we hunger after clearer, warmer and engaging sound and Bob Ludwig doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Instead of reviewing every track of the album I will provide brief comment on three tracks, \\"Tenement Funster\\", \\"Flick of the wrist\\" and \\"Lily of the Valley\\".  These three examples illustrate in general what has occurred with the mastering of the whole album.<br /><br />Phew, those plucked acoustic strings at the start of \\"Tenement Funster\\" are crisp and beautiful. Then Roger's reverberating voice cuts through - this is the forerunner of \\"I'm in love with my car\\" including the car growls. Possibly because this is his song, the drums and particularly the toms are colorful rather than the padded sound that many drummers had in the 70's. Bob Ludwig has managed to wrench that little bit more with this 2011 edition, I'm convinced.<br /><br />\\"Flick of the wrist\\" is a complicated track with heavy passages of walls of vocals over thundering drums yet there is clarity in comparison with the muddier '91 version.  Freddie's vocals show much greater separation - I don't have the words to describe other than say there's a vitality to this recording. As he sings \\"Dislocate your spine\\" you would think this was a recent recording. So much happening, guitar squeals, volume swells, layers of choral backing but sounding cleaner. Cleaner yes, but in a way so that you can hear the grittiness and tone of Brian's rhythm playing better and with stronger bass presence from John. The drums although still not as defined as what I hoped for are impressive on \\"Flick of the wrist\\".<br /><br />The segway into the quieter \\"Lily of the Valley\\" is worth listening to repeatedly. The delicate cymbal work I have never really noticed till now and the trill on the piano seems more pronounced.  Note the full throated chord at the end of \\"Lily\\" has presence rather than just volume. Yes, like \\"Queen 2\\" this album has benefitted from the remastering. For casual listeners who have an existing edition of Sheer Heart Attack you may still have doubts.<br /><br />So still not convinced? There is the sweetener of the 5 track bonus EP.  What a sharp live 1975 recording of \\"Now I'm here\\". Great track!

0451228375|4.0|This beautiful novel is about the life of Gwenda & Caris, two ladies who become friends since being little girls and who also build an ever lasting relationship although they couldn't belong to such different lifes, with destinies very distant and in some cases, even opposite.<br />At the same time, Gwenda & Caris are women of decision and leadership. They represent pursuit of happiness at its best in the XIV century England, when tons of conspiracy, politics, beliefs, some violence and also a lot of lust where alive and kicking in Kingsbridge; the city created by Kevin Follett that could easily become a tourism destiny if it was real.<br /><br />Impossible not to compare World Without End with Pillars Of The Earth. Yes, there are several things in common:<br />1. World Without End is staged at same Kingsbridge of Pillars Of The Earth, only two centuries later.<br />2. World Without End uses the same story telling style of Pillars Of The Earth, but with different characters.<br />3. World Without End uses the same plot of Pillars Of The Earth, growth of the city and the building of a bridge in the second book;  the foundation of the city and the building of a cathedral in the first book. Both novels even detail the building techniques of the XII century with those of 200 hundred years later.<br /><br />No need to make further comparisons, as I believe there are not anymore.<br /><br />World Without End is about things that can happen again and again, maybe with different people and maybe at different stages in life. And Kevin Follett uses the plague disease of the XIV century to write about honour, ambition, pride and desire, and that's why the more you read, the more you feel like walking, or running or fighting in Kingsbridge.<br /><br />Something I didn't like (yes, there is something) is that the story loses pace because of situations, characters and places that are reminded several times. Maybe the author was afraid of getting the reader to forget several details as the story is long. In reality, the book is easy to read in spite of its length.<br /><br />World Without End is a novel you can read without having read the Pillars, but if you loved reading the first novel about Kingsbridge, you will enjoy and have a lot of fun with this second delivery. If you haven't read Pillars you won't need it to love World. I still hope Kevin Follett decides to take us back to those streets, castles, bridges, houses and cathedrals very soon.ls as the story is long.

B004E0Z4XK|5.0|Lush, mellow and sexy as all get-out, this curious pairing of American producer Danger Mouse (he of Gnarls Barkley and Broken Bells) and Italian composer Daniele Luppi (he of Sex and the City) could have been tedious. But Mr. Mouse's track record of mesmerizing collaborations -- no matter how out-there the premise -- remains peerless, as this tribute to iconic Italian film music drips with '60s cool. The material is original; the project was five years in the making. But Ennio Morricone's influence (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West) is robust. In order to replicate the retro sound, Danger Mouse and Luppi recorded as if it were 50 years ago, which means no computer trickery. They also brought in musicians who worked with Morricone on those classic spaghetti-Western scores. And to give it all a little commercial polish (but still retain that hip sheen), Jack White and Norah Jones were brought in to contribute vocals, each one steamier than the next. Jack White plays a sorta gunslinger, especially on The World, which sounds like dusty dueling music. And Jones is pure femme fatale, luring people into her tricky web on many scrumptious rides. This is a true masterpiece and I can already say it will be overlooked by many but trust me and get this one now!
B000YAA68W|4.0|PERSEPOLIS is an Iranian animated feature available from Amazon. This is a poignant animation which captures all the pathos and disruption which the Iranian revolution brought about for many people as observed by a child who tries to come to terms with the disillusioning effects she sees taking place in the lives of those around her.  As she grows up and has to deal with loss and the disaffection resulting from the stultifying effect of living in a police state where everyone is under constant surveillance, she perseveres to find meaning in her existence and comfort from her culture.  The choice of \\"Persepolis\\", as its title, suggests that the glorious period of the Archaemenid Empire (550-330 BCE) can still be an inspiration to Iranians today.  The remarkable cultural achievements of that empire and its cultivation of the first internationalism may well challenge the mediocrity and bland face of Persia today.[[ASIN:B000YAA68W Persepolis]]

1594484805|5.0|First I saw him speak at a women's business conference. Then I posed as an HR professional to see and hear him again. At that conference I bought a book (I think it was A Whole New Mind) and read it. That's the best order of things because when I read the book, I could hear Dan's voice in my head. He is an excellent and entertaining speaker and one of the brightest, most original minds in our country today. You are fortunate - you don't have to sneak around to hear Dan speak. You can just, as one reviewer suggested, play the recording of his TED talk but I'd buy the book too. Even better, get the Audible version. Since I'm a Pink Groupie, I'll probably do both.
0670022411|5.0|There is no way this book should be compared to Wizards of Waverly Place.  There is heavy history sprinkled throughout the book.   There is thought and breadth to this book. Yes, there are magical creatures of many sorts in this book and the main vampire seems like a cross between Carlisle Cullen and a Volutri.  It won't be a teen book at all.  It is way too mature in nature, but I can't wait for the next book!  If you are of a more mature age as well,you want an addictive read, and you haven't had a good fix since Potter or Twighlight, this book is for you!

B004QITJC2|5.0|Ok guys and gals, this is the dark-oriented classic metal release I was expecting since Mercyful Fate's \\"9\\". Want some occult stuff without the annoying black-metal mannerisms? Check! Great production values too? Check! Intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics? Check! Clean vocals which aren't power metal and sound original and fresh? Check! Soaring guitar solos? Check! Crushing, menacing riffs? Check! And last, but not least... wanna some GREAT songwriting? Check that too!    For the initiated ones, you already knew the cult band HELL took by assault the underground UK metal scene back in 1982. Fronted by the talented guitarist and singer Dave Halliday, the band was perhaps too groundbreaking for its time, so they got completely (and criminally!) overlooked by the specialized press. Thus, barely releasing a couple of demos, their career was finally cut short by Halliday's suicide in 1987.    Nobody could predict then that HELL would come back 30 years later, stronger than ever. Counting now with the services of the extraordinary metal producer and ex-Sabbat axeman Andy Sneap on the guitar duties, as well as the sheer voice of David Bower, HELL's rebirth has arrived served on a golden cradle -a well-designed package containing remakes of 11 of their classic tracks, enriched with a pristine, modern production, as well as a tighter-than-ever performance.    As one uses to say, there is no filler on this album. Some highlights include the single \\"On Earth As It Is In Hell\\" (whose video was published in YouTube several weeks ago), the fast paced \\"Plague and Fire\\" (what a great intro guitar solo!), the very menacing \\"Blasphemy And The Master\\", the daring \\"Save Us From Those Who Would Save Us\\", the devilish \\"Macbeth\\" and the doom-flavored \\"No Martyr's Cage\\".    All the songs contained here are arranged intelligently and performed with rock-solid musicianship, aggressiveness, attitude and finesse. Special mentions go to the colorful singing of David Bower (I cannot stress enough how good he is!) and the superb work done by Kev Bower (keyboards and guitars), which lead the pack and definitively push the level of this musical offer to the max. Bravo!    In few words, \\"Human Remains\\" is a FIVE STARS album no metal fan should miss, particularly if you are into King Diamond and Mercyful Fate -by the way, for those who might accuse HELL of copying Mercyful Fate, you must be informed that both bands were contemporary and that this \\"new\\" material was actually written when Mercyful Fate wasn't known at all. Coincidence then? Or synchronicity? Well... who knows? After all, Devil's ways are inscrutable too! LOL! In any case, play \\"Human Remains\\" LOUD and enjoy it, as not everyday our ears receive such a treat. Thank you for the music, HELL!

B004RUF9DC|4.0|I am an avid movie buff since childhood and have always loved the big biblical epics of the late 50's and early 60's. Whenever any of these movies premiered in NYC I would be there on opening day to see it. The Greatest Story Ever Told has been one of my favorite films so I was excited to see the blu-ray release of this wonderful movie. However, although the movie on blu-ray looks substantially better than the dvd release, I was quite disappointed in the picture quality of this new release. Good at times, fair at times, never really consistent. This classic movie deserves a restoration similar to The Ten Commandments and Gone With The Wind and The Sound Of Music. Buy it if you don't already have it on DVD ortherwise wait for a 4k restoration.

0439023513|3.0|This will not be an abnormally long review nor will it have any spoilers. I am going to start with saying this is not a bad book, I am hesitant to give it 3 stars instead of 4 but compared to the other two books it just seemed out of place. Collins achieved her goal of making war look awful. But she lost a lot of what made the first books so captivating. The relationships that are build and continued throughout the first two are what made them so memorable and treasured and this book just does not contain that sort of care for those relationships. I feel peoples personalities are cheapened and made into once faced people.  Now aside from all that, I could not put the book down. If you have read the first two you simply have to read this one to give yourself some closure to this wild ride of a series. It is constantly go go go and it always has you with your fingers on the next page waiting to see what happens next. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the first two but just be weary, although it is a must read for closure, it is not the same as the first two.
0307477479|1.0|From the time I read the first review of A Visit from the Good Squad, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it myself.  So I was thrilled when on a recent business trip I inadvertently packed my novel into my checked bag and had to buy a new book at the airport bookstore. However, it took all of my willpower to finish it. I usually love novels where disparate characters' paths cross over time.  This novel was too much of that. Although I read it in just several days, I kept having to refer back to the earlier chapters - who was Alex again? Lulu? Scotty? I really disliked the way Egan, repeatedly, synopsized the rest of a character's life in a single, long paragraph. Midway through as I realized I wasn't enjoying the book, I told myself to not think of it as a novel, but instead think of it as a series of short stories. Didn't help. So many of the vignettes seemed pointless. I would describe Egan's writing as descriptive, but not necessarily rich. I didn't find myself vested in any of her characters. And I found the description of the future world, 202x, at the end very contrived. I so wanted to love this book.  I purchased it believing it would be one of the best novels I read all year. I was really disappointed...in it, in myself.
1439107955|5.0|I struggled through this book because of the importance of the subject matter and the graceful writing of the author, but I cannot say I was really enlightened or encouraged when I turned the last page.  Perhaps it is because I've lost, and continue to lose too many friends to this disease, but I was greatly distressed to read of all the money spent on research and the many accompanying turf wars and squabbles that have marked those involved in seeking to understand and cure this age-old disease.  A great book I would recommend to those who are looking for something more uplifting and positive is the book by Leigh Fortson, \\"Embrace, Release, Heal: An Empowering Guide to Talking about, Thinking about, and Treating Cancer\\" which came out April, 2011.  When embarking on the journey of cancer, it is helpful to have both medical and emotional support, and Fortson's highly readable book offers a good compendium of the latter to augment the medical treatment protocols of the treating physician.
B004GHNHVW|4.0|It's another Paul Simon album.  It sold 65,000 copies without any airplay.  I wouldn't consider it his best work, but it's still Paul Simon, which means it's gotta be good.  He does some more exploring of new styles and sounds, but there is that ever-familiar Simon touch that weaves it all together.
1567184855|5.0|Dr. Michael Newton is a certified Master Hypnotherapist. Many people being hypnotized can address events that happen early in their childhood the memories of which have been surpressed. This can help them to cope with some of these issues that may affect their lives now.     In hypnoizing clients, Dr. Newton found that some of these clients could be put into a state he calls a \\"superconsious\\" state.  During this state clients would relate memories that existed in a spritual state that exists between lives we live here on earth. And in some cases clients even relate events that took place in their previous lives.     So; this brings up the question: Are we here on earth once or many times?

B000XUBFE2|2.0|This book wasn't for me. I had to read it for school and I found a major problem about it. It had no BIG climax. Let't take New Moon for example(I know, I don't like Twilight much either). It's climax was when Bella had to save Edward. In this book there was nothing big or obvious about that. That was the major turnoff for me. Another problem I found out about this book was that it was REALLY confusing. Usually when I'm confused it's only for the first few pages in the beginning of the book because no one knows much about the book. Well, in this book my confusion lasted for a few CHAPTERS. I was disappointed in this book because I saw all the great reviews, but after I read it I wanted by money back. If you're looking for a deep and thoughtful book, then this wasn't as bad as my review made it. Hopefully this helped you and didn't confuse you guys much.     ~L.M.
B0043A0U94|3.0|Remasters are like turkey at Thanksgiving; some people prefer light meat and some people perfer dark meat and there's rarely anything you can do to change their mind. Trying to get someone who likes one to try the other and like it can be an impossible task. That's the story with the Audio Fidelity \\"52nd Street\\".<br /><br />As one of my favorite albums I might be biased because I liked the original pressing on vinyl and found the Sony gold edition, although it featured a bit of compression  because it gave Liberty DeVito's drums a bigger, booming sound appropriate to the material, quite nice In search of the perfect version of this on CD I've gone through the first CD pressing from Japan, the Sony Mastersound disc, the Ted Jensen remaster and now this one. They all sound a little bit different. For the record (pardon the pun) I don't have the SACD because it wasn't a hybrid--I prefer hybrids so I can listen to the disc anywhere and having the choice of the redbook layer and SACD layer is nice in those instances.<br /><br />The Audio Fidelity favors Joel's vocals and has a nice midrange but it also sounds veiled compared to previous remasters and darker. This will really come down to your system and what you enjoy. If you prefer something on the brighter side, you'll enjoy Jensen's remaster more than this and the drums have a little more kick there. If you enjoy a flat transfer of the mastertape warts and all (as well as a very different experience)with a darker sound (and it does sound veiled to me although there are some little details that pop out more because of the increased focus on the midrange)this one is for you.<br /><br />I'm not one that necessarily likes brighter mastering either so I was surprised that I didn't care for this (although it's primarily due to the fact that it does indeed sound somewhat veiled).<br /><br />I personally prefer the original Japanese edition (the Japan for U.S. is also very good and sounds very similar--I can't claim it's the same mastering but it sounds darn close)and the Sony Mastersound to this edition.<br /><br />The indexing appears to be fine as far as I can tell. The beginning bit on the title track where Joel does his count-off is correctly indexed.<br /><br />The artwork here includes the lyrics and it looks quite nice. Of all the Audio Fidelity products this is probably my least favorite (although I do wish that \\"Pretenders\\" hadn't been peak limited in that case it kind of works in the albums favor given that it was designed to play loud but it isn't my go-to version for that album).<br /><br />My suggestion--if you can find it inexpensively and you like ALL of Steve Hoffman's work pick it up and judge for yourself but be prepared because it is a different listening experience and, even if it isn't messed with, it still sounds veiled by comparison to other versions. It's not as bright as previous remasters but it also lacks some of the depth and sounds a bit muffled compared to others (no doubt due to the increased focus on the midrange here).<br /><br />I'm sticking with the versions I like which doesn't include this one. Your mileage may vary depending on your system, your ears and what your expectations are for the album (a fact rarely discussed--our exposure to something in a different medium and how we hear it the first time CAN inform our expectations later since we can't hear the master tapes--having said that if the master tapes sound like this, I prefer what previous mastering engineers have done to them to improve their sound because of this bias).rn close)and the Sony Mastersound to this edition.

0316077054|5.0|I read this book and absolutely LOVED it, it has all the qualities of a book you'll want to read over and over. There were times I laughed, times I teared up, and times I was chewing my nails right off, that always means it's a keeper for me. If you are looking for a great book to enjoy over and over again, this is the one for you. After telling all of my friends about this series and rereading it several times, I am impatiently awaiting the third book in this series. I hope this review helped:)

The sound is RIGHT THERE...by far better than any of their other dvd/bluray releases....In \\"Ballbreaker\\" and \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", the guitars sound somewhat \\"distant.\\" Anyone who owns those will know what I mean...but not this show...I'm still somewhat partial to Live At Donnington but I definitely got more with this disc than I was expecting....HD makes all the difference in the world....I had to laugh when Brian Johnson said, \\"We don't speak Spanish very well but we play ROCK AND ROLL pretty good!\\".....FIVE STARS for sure..I wish I could give it more....put it on Dolby Digital Multi-channel and crank it up...it will take your breath!
B00395ZYVS|5.0|It is rare that a book totally captures me and completely sweeps me away to the point I'm not even aware of reading. This one did.<br /><br />Secret Daughter walks the divide between two cultures with such grace that it is very easy to make the switch between the them. I loved learning more about India, though much of the knowledge was simply heartbreaking. The characters were so realistic and the author wrote them with warts and all. The writing is brilliant in its simplicity and just swept me completely into the story. The manner in which the writer dealt with adoption was exceptional. Everything just felt absolutely true and real. I believe this is a hard thing for writing to achieve, but it is a truly amazing thing when an author accomplishes it with their very first book.<br /><br />What I loved best about the book was that it could have been formulaic and ended with a typical happy ending. There's nothing formulaic about this book to me, and the ending while happy was not what I expected at all. I don't want to spoil it for anyone else, but I will say I cried and that's pretty unusual for me. Wonderful heartrending ending.<br /><br />I have to say that this book now rests in my top five favorite books of all time. Anyone who enjoys stories of other cultures will certainly enjoy this book. This is a book that reminds just why I fell in love with reading to begin with: magic. I certainly hope to see more books by this author in the future.
B004OR1X6A|4.0|The late legendary Irish singer-songwriter/guitarist Rory Gallagher's recording label has finally released 2 CDs (24 songs) of 'previously unreleased' material together in a 2 CD compilation for the first time, titled 'Notes From San Francisco'. (Some material however has been released in 1978 & as well as bonus tracks in other CDs before but in bits & pieces only). Disc 1 (12 tracks) has previously unreleased studio material recorded in 1977 in San Francisco, California). This great CD opens with the track \\"Rue The Day\\" : a great countryish rock track with great vocals & melody. Other great tracks include \\"Persuasion\\" (up-tempo rock track with great melody), \\"B Girl\\" (bluesy up-tempo track, very melodical & inspiring vocals), \\"Overnight Bag\\" (great bluesy guitar & vocals), \\"Brute Force And Ignorance\\" (bluesy rock track, great guitar, melody & vocals), \\"Wheels Within Wheels(alt. version)\\" (wonderful guitar solo) & \\"Cut A Dash\\". Okay tracks are \\"Cruise On Out\\" (bluesy up-tempo track) & \\"Out On The Tiles\\". Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"Mississippi Sheiks\\" (wonderful rock track with great guitar & melody), \\"Wheels Within Wheels\\" (countryish track with incredible Gibson guitar sound) & \\"Fuel The Fire\\" (slow-tempo rock track, wonderful melody & great guitar). On overall, this is a great studio album material recorded in 1977 (finally seen the light of the day). I rate this Disc 1 (studio album) 4,5 stars.    Disc 2 (12 tracks) is a live recording of Rory Gallagher at The Waldorf (San Francisco, CA) in 1979. Stand-out/gem/solid track is \\"Tatto'd Lady\\" (up-tempo rock track with great vocals & melody). Great tracks include \\"Follow Me\\", \\"Shinkicker\\" (wonderful guitar & vocals), \\"Off The Handle\\", \\"Bought And Sold\\", \\"I'm Leavin'\\", \\"Do You Read Me\\" (great drums), \\"Country Mile\\" (great melody & vocals), \\"Shadow Play\\", \\"Bullfrog Blues\\" (high pitched vocals) & \\"Sea Cruise\\". The live performances/recordings could have sounded better (but hey it's 1979) & I  rate Disc 2 three and half stars.    In conclusion, this blast from the past material recorded in San Francisco (studio album & live recording) in a 2 CD compilation for the first time, should be a sought after compilation by the legendary late Irish singer-songwriter/guitarist Rory Gallagher's loyal fans, a recommended 2 CDs listening.

Dragos is basically the leader of his people; some see him as a god others see him as a beast. Based on his strength and personality it's very possible he is both. Dragos is a tall dark and very handsome man that can also turn into a dragon. Definitely someone you don't want to upset. But for me, he seemed to get upset a lot and randomly fly off the handle. He's super obsessive, overly jealous beyond being just possessive and pretty much needs to be enrolled in anger management classes asap. He's used to getting what he wants when he wants it immediately, and Pia is someone he can't control.    From the beginning I really liked Pia, feisty and full of spunk she grabbed me but she also had some major issues going on. Snarky dialog throughout the book was great, but the drama between these two started to give me a headache by the end of the story. Houston we have a problem and it's communication. These two constantly misconstrued just about everything the other was doing or saying like an old Abbot and Costello sketch. Blah. After the umpteenth time this happened it started to get really old.    On the positive side, and there is a lot of positive, the action was amazing. You are taken on an truly epic adventure from our world to the Other, and the author does a GREAT job keeping the reader in all the action. Loved it. Some amazing romance was going on as well, and I got my fill on details! You won't be disappointed in this area. ;) I liked the aspect of Names holding power in this series, and the author is very clever about leaving the reader in suspense. Dragos's trusted team of hotties are fun characters to read about as well, and I can see so much potential for this series with all his boys. I can't wait. Book 1 for me was a bit rough, but I hope as this series grows so will each character. This series is definitely worth a read, just proceed with caution.    I would also like to point out that the \\"Queen of the Vampires\\" lives in San Francisco, and really who else could the author be speaking about? lol. My name is spreading far and wide people. ;)  ***SPOILER ALERT***  I waited for Dragos to say I Love You...and he never did! How messed up was that?! Really bugged me.    [..]
B000MLNUBI|5.0|I read a few articles about automatic and I would recommend you do so as well.  One of the articles said that you have to adjust your watch frequently because it is not as accurate as a quartz watch.  I really don't think this is much of a problem.  I probably adjust my watch about once a week, and it is usually only off by a little bit.      I like the look of this watch and as long as you don't mind it not having any numbers, it is a great watch to go with
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I didnt think an alarm clock app could be so complex but easy to easy. Glad i scooped it up for free on amazon. This thing is amazing. I love the volume 'crescendo' that gets louder and louder and the 'shake for snooze' option. You can set the duration of 'shake' and have the duration increase every time snooze goes off. after the third snooze i was fully awake because i set it to shake for 6 seconds before it goes into snooze haha. definitely woke me up.
B003UESJF6|5.0|I watched this movie and absolutely loved it. It was so hilarious. Megamind was thrilling and so full of surprises and HILARIOUS comedy and humor. Has a bit of crudeness involved but that's what makes the movie funny. I personally think that if it isn't, this movie should be rated the Best Movie of The Year. I watched it twice, the second time with my dad and he loved it. Megamind and MetroMan or whatever he was called lol were both so funny. Especially when MetroMan hilariously faked his death and started laughing histarically. And the part when he told them he was retired and started singing- o-h m-y g-o-s-h. So funny!! You should really watch this movie, it's hilarious!
1594202710|4.0|I just got my hardcover copy of Henry Kissenger's newly published On China (Penguin). I enjoyed the NY Times excerpts on Saturday and ordered the book at once from Amazon. I am sure I will enjoy the reading; but I am disappointed in the plain design of the cover and jacket.  And where are the full-color, fold-out maps needed to understand China's place in the world? It is not your fault, Amazon, but who else can I blame?<br /><br />Why is it that cookbooks, books on art and architecture, and coffee-table books are beautifully illustrated and often innovatively bound but that even the most important nonfiction works show little of the bookbinder's and book designer's crafts? I gladly would pay a 50% premium for the same book in a premium edition.<br /><br />If we can have Kindle and other digital editions that are stripped bare of all but the words, can we not have something else that looks good on the shelf, is fun to touch, and makes a handsome gift? McLuhan was mostly right, \\"The medium is the message.\\"  On China may be seen by many as an important book, even a valuable book; too bad it is not a beautiful book.<br /><br />Perhaps this explains why I can not read my Kindle unless it has on its red, Moroccan leather jacket.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This musical is the best I've seen in a long time.  The story line is really wonderful and it accurately depicts an era in recent history so familiar to me.  Love the actors/singers.

B00127RAJY|5.0|(My thoughts are very scattered so bare with me in this review haha. Plus, this is only the first or second one I have ever written :))    I am not big on writing reviews, but I am HUGE on reading them :) I absolutely will not buy a product without enough evidence that it works; when I say evidence, I mean reviews from real people and NOT those fake testimonials we see so often on tv. So, when I went on Amazon to check on this product and saw the ratings, reviews, and pictures... I knew I probably should get it. Well, I did. It took me about a whole 2 months to actually start it, but I decided the time had come when I finally needed to. So, I got on the scale and weighed myself. I had read a lot of comments talking about not losing weight, but losing a ton of inches so I decided to also measure myself. I started this program on May 9th. That morning I woke up, ready to start shredding my fat. I worked out every morning on Level 1 for 4 days. [I have to admit, I have been on a 3 days hiatus hahaha.] I couldn't take it anymore so I hopped on the scale and I couldn't believe it. In just 4 days, I had lost 6.5 pounds!!! I am still surprised!!! I did change my eating habits though. So, I believe this had something to do with it. [If anyone wants to know what I ate, just comment on the post and I will gladly tell you :)] To be honest, I am not too fond of Jillian... But how can I discredit the amazing body that she is about to help me to achieve haha. I havent measured myself yet, because it has only been a week and a day. I am sure I will update at the end of my 30 days though.    By the way, I am a girl. So, yes, women. We too can lose weight at a fairly fast pace. Haha.
0756405890|4.0|I had more than one friend extoll the virtues of this book to me--one claims it was the best book he's ever read. So I read it.<br /><br />I'll grant that it was good--Rothfuss has created an absorbing world rich in language, custom, and character. While I've seen his trope of magic before, it was well thought out and intriguing nonetheless. In addition, the characters we encounter are all very detailed and drawn exquisitely. Kvothe, the main protagonist, has been called, in the negative reviews too arrogant--I find that his arrogance, rather than making him one-dimensioned and unbelievable, is a wholly realistic character flaw. Kvothe's successes are not out-of-the-blue, as some fantasy novels create their heroes, but in-character and ring true; so too, are his failures.<br /><br />The reason I couldn't quite rate this as a 5 star book (it'd be 4.5 if I could) is that Rothfuss asks the reader to have faith that it gets faster paced. The first half of the book, perhaps two-thirds, even, is Kvothe setting up his own story and drawing the scenes for you. While necessary and beautiful, it is all too easy to put the book down and wonder when something monumental--something deserving of 670 pages--is going to happen.<br /><br />That being said, I'm looking forward to reading the next book, and hoping that the pivotal action scenes Rothfuss introduces in the last part of the book continue and grow.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|Keeping it simple; this book was  B O R I N G. It could and should have been condensed into one or two chapters. Considering the ridiculous price that's being charged for the Kindle version the author should be ashamed. I want my money back!
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I have been a huge fan of the original Perplexus for a while now, and when I heard about the Epic, I had to get it as soon as it came out. And I'm glad I did! If you've played the original and liked it, but wanted more of a challenge, stop reading this right now, and buy this product. I'm usually really good with puzzles (I beat the original Perplexus the same day I bought it), but the Epic was a real challenge, and took me 3 or 4 days to complete!   The new obstacles are really cool! A lot of moving ones this time around, like a zipline-y thing you use in three different ways, and a see-saw thing you use twice. The stationary ones are cool too, like stairs, tubes, slides, and even a ramp. But beware, some parts may seem easy, but you'll fall again and again, and frustration ensues quickly!  Word of advice: if you haven't ever played Perplexus before, do NOT start with this one. Start with the original, or maybe even the Rookie. The Rookie is good for someone who had trouble with the original, or for children. But if you want an awesome marble-rolling challenge, the Perplexus EpIc is for you!
B00466HM28|4.0|You're impression of this unit will likely depend on your acceptance of what it is and is not intended to be.  If all you need is a nice way to input MIDI commands into your computer, you will be quite pleased.  I bought this because it's the most affordable and most portable MIDI keyboard on the market.  It fits great into my laptop bag, and setting it up is a no-brainer.  The keys look small, like on a toy keyboard, but they actually play just fine for me, and I've got big fingers.  I think they just look small because they aren't very long, but the width is okay.  The build quality seems to be very sturdy to me.  If I had to come up with one complaint, it is that you can't really tweak the sensitivity profile of the keys and pads.  And I wish there were some sort of thin gig bag offered with this, even as a $10 accessory.  If anyone knows a good one, let me know.    If you're looking for something to compete with an M-Audio Axiom, this is not it.  It doesn't have all the I/O, the bells and whistle, the nice keys, etc.  But you can't fault it for not being something that it's not trying to be.

B002RHGYOA|4.0|The start was a bit slow and couldn't quite figure out the relevance of the characters from the caribean but once Lisbeth got back to Sweden the book picked up and became quite enthralling. I found the pace much better than for Dragon and you get to understand the heroine a bit better since the focus is more on her. The chance meetings in Stockholm were a bit unbelievable and do people in Sweden really drink all that much coffee?
0307394549|5.0|Everyone knows Martha Stewart publishes great cookbooks, but this one is extra special because of the format and layout of the table of contents, that part of a cookbook which I usually skip.  But not this one!  The TOC is divided in logical categories, like chewy, crunchy, and savory, and it is not just a list with cookie names and page numbers, but each entry has a small color photo of the finished product!  A wonderful and quick way to help me find exactly the look of the cookie I want to make for my particular event.  Kudos to MS and her edictorial staff for coming up with still another creative idea to help all of us harried cooks out here!  And the recipes themselves are wonderful -- lots of unusual but delicious taste combinations -- not just a reincarnation of all the cookies I've been baking for years.  Buy this cookbook -- you won't be sorry!

1416594795|4.0|Creationist or evolutionist, one has to agree Dawkins is sheer genius. Who else could afford to footnote that if humans had eight fingers -- rather than ten -- we would have been using computers about a century ago (hint: hexadecimal counting). Like his metaphorical detective, he radiates charm -- to a fish, an island is a pond surrounded by water. He catches attention before it wanders off by incongruousness -- in an isolated island ecosystem, big animals get smaller, and otherwise small animals get bigger (Galapagos Tortoise). He points out what could prove his belief wrong -- if one finds mammalian fossils, say, at rocks mapping to Davonian period much before any Darwinist estimates Mammals evolved at. Science is not about only showing the proof ('publication bias'), but also pointing out what situations would render the proof meaningless. That's exactly what differentiates Dawkins -- he spent a full chapter on why an 'intelligent design', like done by an architect on whiteboard, would not have made human back (think: chronic pain) like it is. It would either let a Cheetah win always, or Gazelle outrun Cheetah every time had the race been designed by someone like a 'computer designer'. But may be a game developer would leave that degree of freedom to let 'local factors' determine the end results in a complex, non-deterministic way? Since 'non-random natural selection' is 'the only game in the town' (as the book ends advocating) --analyzing the idea of that 'intelligent gamer' would have been fun!

0307389839|4.0|\\"All I can see is the ground three yards ahead, nothing beyond. My whole world consistes of the ground three yards ahead. No need to think beyond that....this was my tiny reason for living.\\"<br /><br />Haruki Murakami, best know for his `stream of consciousness' and brutally honest writing style, goes introspective on the weird random thoughts he has when he runs. In a memoir (of sorts) he draws from his life as a hugely successful novelist, seasoned bar owner, and, on most frigid New England afternoons, long distance runner, to bring us his views of the world, writing and running.<br /><br />I read this book for Murakami's thoughts on writing first and foremost. I've known of his quirky writing style for some time, and thought I might get a little insight into that groovy brain of his. Little did I suspect this book would be so spiritual. As it turns out, the writing `advice' or `tips' are pretty scarce: Haruki describes it mostly as painful, grinding manual labor. In fact, for a guy that runs as much as he does, it turns out he almost never gets any new ideas for novels while running. I found this somewhat disappointing. Of all the time he spends running, and he doesn't get any inspiration at all? But then I realized, that his job is writing and selling books, why would he want to think about work, in what is meant to be an escape from the office.<br /><br />As boring as it sounds, Murakami seems to get all his great ideas from....pushing himself to keep writing, in much the same way he pushes himself to run. It looks glamourous and \\"fun\\" from afar, but it really is work. If you want to be good, there is no secret, you just have to work. I've heard of writers that force themselves to write in volume, either 10 pages a day, or a notepad per week, whatever-they force themselves to get it all out on the page, and then the real fun comes later: editing (sometimes tossing 80-90% of their original draft).<br /><br />The beauty of Murakami's writing is that he's able to revisit a past moment, and relive it so vividly, that he can recapture the stream of consciousness, the wild ramblings of his inner mind, that seems the most impossible thing to recall, the hardest thing to fake. He's either brilliant at making this up, or has an amazing memory. Either way, we get to tag along (not just in this, but his other novels as well).<br /><br />When it comes to running, Murakami goes the distance. Sprinting for 40 metres is wild, electric and explosive, whereas long distance running is something else entirely: it's almost pointless in its repetitiveness and slow plodding pace; it can be dull, it can be lonely, it can be brutally painful and intimidating-what can we possibly learn from running? In many ways, Murakami reflects in Spiritual, almost ascetic tones on the breakthroughs he's had while running marathons: it's only when he's been pushed to the physical breaking point, that his perceptions of pain and thirst, and ego, and struggle, truly shattered into a million pieces, like when he describes his 62-mile ultra marathon run. The last 30 minutes, he recounts, as a blissful breezy union with nature, where the plants and the birds, and all the clouds seemed to cheer him on, and he passed about 30 other runners. He seemed to break free from his own body, for just a brief period, but as they say, a mind once learned, will never see the world the same way again.<br /><br />And all those races, what's it all for? Ego? Fame? Publicity? Not at all. Running is one of the few sports where, you're racing against yourself, so you can't lie. You have to be brutally honest, because no one else cares. There is no publicity and the awards are few and far between. You can walk. You can quit. No one will ever push you to run (and most will even talk you out of it, because you're ultrafit lifestyle is incredibly annoying). But you don't run because it's easy, you do it, because you want to push yourself, and be as strong at 52 as you were at 25. Murakami, again, in brutal honesty, recounts with some regret that he may never be as strong as agile as he once was. It's nature. It's reality.It's not just a race, it's a struggle with mortality. Ultimately, the rewards come as glimpses of some great awakening-glimpses that we don't get if we walk the last 2 miles of the marathon. The great battle against our tired racked bodies (and what they may or may not be capable of) can only be won out there, on the lonely road, at the crack of dawn, with our bleary eyes focused on the next 3 yards, and nothing more.<br /><br />More Reviews like this on 21tigeregret that he may never be as strong as agile as he once was.

B002UZCJUC|5.0|The quality is great.  I enjoyed going back in time to watch Michael being silly, running from cartoons, protecting the children, dancing, singing ... it took me back to a time of innocence.  I am sure I will watch this movie over and over again, and a Michael Jackson DVD collection is not complete without it.  There will never be another Michael Jackson.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|Poor rating is for the DVD product, not for the movie (which was awesome, by the way -- the best of the series)    The DVD starts with something like 20-30 minutes of commercials which you can't skip.  Commercial for the video game.  Commercial for the other video game.  ANOTHER commercial for the other video game.  Commercial for the theme park.  It just goes on and on and you can't skip them.    Here's how you watch this movie:  pop it into the player, press play, go out for dinner.  Then, when you're back home, turn on the TV and watch the movie.    I see why some people download pirated movies -- it lets you skip the commercials.    Agree with other comments about the picture quality.  I wanted to fiddle with the brightness controls on my TV.
0061537969|2.0|Mr. Stein is a master of Formula Writing and as such appeals to the masses and achieves his desired commercial success. He follows all the 10 or so Steps to Building a Story that Sells. We have a protagonist, an antagonist, conflict, belief system, foreshadowing, climax and HEA, that is a Happily Ever After.    The novel is a perfect soap opera with love, illness, death, tears, and even a courtroom drama thrown in! Actually, even masterpieces of literature follow some kind of `formula', yet this novel is regrettably, but definitely not a masterpiece and does not deserve all the attention it is getting. I admit, Enzo was sweet, and there were moments when I teared up or where I chuckled, but in the end this is just a genre fiction written by an author who was itching to `break into fiction' at a neck breaking speed and ended up in a wreckage. Well, Garth Stein is not my champion.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|I think Danny Boyle's Sunshine is one of the finest Science Fiction films of the past 25 years.  Except for maybe Moon (which I rate just behind Sunshine) it's the only film of the genre that really made me think and seemed fresh/original in recent years.  Great story, (I know some don't enjoy the 3rd act of the film but I like it) incredible direction-creating tension/suspense/claustraphobia of being on the ship the entire movie, and an impressive ensemble cast including Cillian Murphy and Chris Evans.  The Blu-ray looks and sounds amazing so it's a great buy.  Sunshine's in my top 10 all time Science Fiction movies.

014241722X|3.0|My 12-year-old recently studied my shelves of novels, which include practically every Grisham book written, and commented that he couldn't wait to be old enough to read \\"Mom's books\\".  I told him he would especially like John Grisham, because they were exciting legal thrillers (Mom's a lawyer!) which also happened to be terribly funny.  When I discovered Grisham had written a book geared toward middle-schoolers, I bought it immediately.  Unfortunately, Grisham seems to have forgotten how he became so popular!  The story introduces numerous characters, unfortunately with practially none of the sizzling dialogue and one-line zingers which distinguish a Grisham story from other authors' work.  Let's hope he gets better at kid lit with practice.

1439102724|4.0|Sing You Home by Jodi Picoult is a story told from the perspective of the three main characters in it: Zoe, Max and Vanessa. The story begins with Max and Zoe as a married couple suffering through infertility. They have gone through repeated cycles of IVF, and Zoe wound up losing a baby late in pregnancy to stillbirth. At this point, Max decides he can't be married to her anymore and asks for a divorce.<br />Max is a weak link, an alcoholic without the ability to make decisions for himself, even after he quits drinking. He becomes a born-again Christian, which appears to solve all his problems at the beginning. The church he joins is Evangelical, and believes everyone is going to hell and they should crusade against pretty much all of society that isn't exactly like they are. Max is living with his brother Reid and sister-in-law Liddy, who are devoted church members themselves.<br />Zoe eventually comes out of her depression after losing both her baby and her husband when she starts spending time with Vanessa. She already knows Vanessa through work. Zoe is a music therapist who works with senior citizens as well as dying, autistic, and depressed children. Vanessa is a counselor in the school Zoe works in. First, they are friends. Zoe is aware that Vanessa is gay, but doesn't think much about it until she realizes that she has fallen for Vanessa, who is already half in love with Zoe anyway. They begin a relationship which leads to marriage, but they cannot get married in Rhode Island and must go to Massachussetts to do so.<br />Eventually, Vanessa offers to carry a child since Zoe cannot, and they ask Max for access to the embryos that were left from the marriage. This is when everything begins to happen.<br />Max, being now a religious Christian, is horrified that his ex-wife is now \\"choosing\\" to be gay, and his Pastor hires an Evangelical Christian attorney who's main work is to crusade around the country spreading hate everywhere he goes. They start a court case to keep Zoe and Vanessa from getting the embryos.<br />This story is extremely emotional, and well-told from both sides. Although it is clear Ms. Picoult falls on the more liberal side of the political spectrum, she handles both sides of the story and all character's viewpoints equally. It would have been easy to paint Max as \\"the bad guy\\", but he truly is not. The Pastor and the lawyer are definitely shown as the nasty human beings they are, always so convinced that they are right, and manipulating everyone else to do their bidding. Max is such a character, so easily swayed by their machinations. But in the end, he does stand up for himself, rather than just his newfound beliefs.<br />I enjoyed this book, but some of it was difficult to read. I am aware of those loudmouth political people who are out there spouting hate left and right, but in the interest of my own sanity, I usually try to avoid listening or reading about them. This was a bit enforced, as it was crucial to the story. It's hard to hear such hatred being spewed at anyone, whether I am part of the group or not.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the topic. It was well-written and very timely in it's subject matter. I hope someday to revisit this story and find it dated in it's viewpoints.Vanessa from getting the embryos.

I am aware of those loudmouth political people who are out there spouting hate left and right, but in the interest of my own sanity, I usually try to avoid listening or reading about them. This was a bit enforced, as it was crucial to the story. It's hard to hear such hatred being spewed at anyone, whether I am part of the group or not.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the topic. It was well-written and very timely in it's subject matter. I hope someday to revisit this story and find it dated in it's viewpoints.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I'm going to miss new Smallville episodes. All I know for sure though is that I'm glad the show went out with a bang.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I have heard rumors that this set, current reigning champion for the largest most expensive set that has not been retired, is due to retire soon. So, if you don't want to pay $1000 or more, now is probably the time to buy. It took me, an adult, 4 days to put it together spending an average of 5 hours a day on it. It comes in one large box with 4 boxes large enough for your average $100 set inside the larger box. There is also a huge spiral bound instruction book that I thought should have come with a thicker cover (it is no thicker than the average Lego instruction paper). Each box contains numbered bags of legos. I found the easiest way to go about building the set was to use small paper bowls to sort the various lego pieces into. This made it much less frustrating to put together when you are looking for one tiny piece among 1,000 pieces at any given time.<br /><br />It was a blast to put together and it is impressive for a lego set. Some people who have come to my work office where I keep it displayed said they thought it would be bigger, but I reminded them it is a lego set and put an average size Star Wars vehicle next to it - then they were impressed.<br /><br />It has far more functionality than I would have guessed even by looking at the pictures. The interior elevator is really cool, as is the turret gun which really shoots a projectile. Our favorite rooms are the trash compactor and emperor's throne room. There is a tunnel from the jail to the trash compactor, several moving doors, and of course 25 minifigures - holy smokes.<br /><br />Yes, it is $400 which is a once in a life time Lego purchase for us, but even I look at it and play with it every day. The kids in our school who come in with their parents have a blast with it as well.
B00124FQCK|5.0|I remember when this album came out. Mob Rules to me is undeniably the best Black Sabbath album, but this was the darkest most Sabbathy, and a natural fit. Even Gillan's version of the song Black Sabbath sounded, in concert, like it came from Hell, not that there is such a place.<br /><br />This album marked the return of Bill Ward, who spoke in interviews about being his most creative and alert on this album and Paranoid. The final track \\"Keep it Warm\\" has his signature jams echoing of the greatness of such Sabotage classics as \\"The Thrill of it All\\" and \\"Megalomania\\". So the fiction on who played drums here is exposed at last. Its also his last time to record with Black Sabbath.<br /><br />The album starts out rocking with \\"Trashed\\" which was the first song to aggravate the censors, despite being a cautionary tale of drinking and race car driving. Not that such opportunities are afforded most of us. Its Black Sabbath's Highway Star.<br /><br />\\"Disturbing the Priest\\" and \\"Zero the Hero\\" are classic Sabbath but just so much darker and menacing. You will shudder.<br /><br />\\"Hot Line\\" is a fair jam and a precursor to \\"Knocking at your back door\\", with some good screams, and Born Again has some of the flange flavor from Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. \\"Keep it Warm\\" is a pure Sabbath jam, with touching blues lyrics, making it their classy number.<br /><br />At first, I was put off by the song Digital Beyotch, until I found out it was about Ozzy's wife. Now I love it!!!<br /><br />This album ranks up there with the great ones, like Master of Reality, Sabotage, Heaven and Hell, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Paranoid and Dehumanizer. Its a shame the Ian Gillan era didn't last a little longer.<br /><br />I can't comment on the Tony Martin/Cozy Powell stuff because its all kept off the local market by the Digital you know who and what, but I do remember Tony being an excellent singer as well.<br /><br />The cover art is Sharon Arden's baby photo.

0446195529|3.0|I have read other books in this series and frankly, I found this book tiring.  The book started slowly with lots of supposition and hypotheses about an explosion in Washington DC.  It wasn't until chapter 28, the action started picking up.  The Camel Club made several cameo appearances and at times looked like the Keystone Cops.  There were so many twists to the plot, double agents, and unforeseen details that there was no way the reader could anticipate or keep up with the movement.  It seems to me that a good suspense novel should involve the reader by baiting curiosity using a few details that the main characters have not yet discovered.  After all was said and done, I am not sure this book is worth the time it takes to read it.
B003O86MY8|5.0|This is a fantastic CD.  David Garrett is very talented and is known as the fastest violin line player today.  I saw him perform on \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" and loved his music.  Thus I had to purchase this album.  I am not disappointed.[[ASIN:B003O86MY8 Rock Symphonies]]
1582406634|5.0|In this book you will see many of Frank Cho's clean line art and pencil illustrations. There is no color, only black and white and some pencil shading. But his style in illustrating women are phenominal. From cartoony to comic book and a few fine art illustrations here and there and alot of pin up art. He is a great example for other artist to aspire to when it comes to drawing women. For me this book is another great addition to my collection.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I was lucky enough to have been at Slane for this unforgettable RHCP performance. I was about five rows from the stage and bang slap in the centre, so this review rates the DVD from the aspect of having been there.     I was a moderate Chilis fan at the time and I admittedly mainly went to the gig to see the Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age who were supporting (best line up EVER). They were both amazing. However, once the Chilis walked onto the stage on that balmy August evening and John Frusciante ripped the air apart with his screaming Fender, all thoughts of what had come before were erased from my mind and I became a total Chili Peppers convert! The atmosphere was unbelievable for the entire gig and I don't hesitate to say that despite having been to many gigs of amazing bands since, it is still, to this day, the best I have ever experienced.     Highlights for me are; the crowd singing along to \\"By the Way\\" is amazing and also a nostalgic highlight for me, as while we were in the queue outside that morning, everyone was chanting \\"Standing in line to see the show tonight!\\" and I know that's what everyone was thinking of when singing it at that moment! Flea's bass improv and \\"dancing\\" at the start of \\"Around the World\\"! ; ) Frusciante's impeccable backing vocals and mind-blowing, face-melting solos that are (unfortunately) absent from the studio versions, Chad smiling his way through the whole gig, \\"Maybe\\" the Chantels cover that John nails, the crowd and band simultaneously jumping at the start of \\"Universally Speaking\\", the blow-up furniture being thrown around the crowd (people actually crowd-surfed on them during the day!), \\"Parallel Universe\\" blows me away every time I watch it, Anthony's dance moves, Flea and Chad's trumpet / drum duet, the general chemistry between the band but especially between John and Flea during the absolutely AMAZING intro to \\"Californication\\": beautiful.     \\"Don't Forget Me\\" is also a personal favourite, not only because it's so beautiful but because during it, I was on someone's shoulders for a minute and I will never forget the sight of looking back up the huge, sloping hill of Slane, lighters dotted throughout like fireflies, and seeing 80,000 people who I knew were all feeling the same sense of awe as I was at that moment.     Although I admire each member of the band and must say that Anthony never sounded better on vocals than he does here, I do have to say that Frusciante added an incomparable amount to the overall effect of this concert. His obvious emotion throughout and his unbelievable ability to make a guitar speak-be it a whisper or a scream-and to completely permeate your soul, made this night absolutely unique and unforgettable, both in reality and on DVD. (He will definitely be very missed).     I own many music DVDs and this is by far the best produced. The sound quality is perfect and the camera work is brilliant, largely focusing on the right person at the right time and with just the perfect level of crowd coverage as well. If you are an RHCP fan at all, buy this DVD now! It will only deepen your love and appreciation for them and their talents. It captures them at their best. I've read one or two complaining about the lack of extras on the DVD and to that I just have to say: Seriously, what more could you possibly want?! Who needs interviews or pointless backstage footage when you have just watched what probably was (and probably will be) one of the best concerts of all time. I certainly have a feeling it may be the best that I will ever witness personally, which makes me feel slightly sad but also so incredibly, thoroughly lucky.

1401201911|4.0|Superman: Red Son is a simple story that all starts with a \\"What If\\". What if Superman had landed in Soviet Russia instead of Smallville? From that one question Mark Millar weaves an incredible alternative history where Superman ultimately becomes a supreme world leader.     Many other well known characters appear as well, including a freedom fighting Batman that I would love to see more of. However it is of course Lex Luthor that is Superman's main nemesis as he devotes his life and neglects his wife, Lois Lane, to defeat Superman. Luthor's obsession with Superman is perfectly in character while remaining unique to an Elseworld, since his motives are somewhat pure.    Ultimately Superman shows that whether raised in America or Russia he is good at heart and would prefer to help people instead of ruling them. The ending drags on a little, but since it is a one-off Elseworld I understand tying up every loose end. I gave this 4 stars since I think it could be a little better with such a rich premise, but I would still recommend this to anyone. If you love Superman, Elseworlds in general, or are just a fan of alternative histories, you should definitely read this.
B004VD3PE0|5.0|Seventeen year old Mia has a pretty good life. She has a great set of parents who understand her and a little brother that doesn't annoy the heck out of her. She has her best friend Kim who is always there. She also has a boyfriend, Adam, that seems like he'd do just about anything for her. Then she has her one true passion, playing the cello. Now she has to choose whether to stay in Oregon with the ones in her life or follow her dreams to New York. All of that soon fades when the unthinkable happens.<br /><br />One second Mia is in the car with her family and the next she is standing outside on the road staring at her body. From then on she watches the people around her and reflects on her own life, memories and choices that have lead up to that moment. But the clock is ticking and now Mia has to face the biggest decision she will ever make. Does she stay?<br /><br />If I Stay is not only one of the best books I've read this year, but hands down one of the best books I have read in a very long time. When I first started it, I wasn't for sure what to expect. The beginning didn't really keep me glued, but I continued to read, and then suddenly I was getting teary eyed (that was just on page 25.) So I knew this was going to be a tear jerker, but I had no clue how much it would really affect me.<br /><br />The book is beautifully written and Mia in particular was a character I quickly became attached to. The relationship she has with her parents, grandparents, and baby brother were parts that I loved reading about. Her friendship with Kim and her boyfriend, how she synced them together, every bit of it was very real. That is why I became a blubbering idiot by the end.<br /><br />Everyone knows life can change in a second. It's something I don't dwell on, but when it's in your face, there's no way to ignore it. It got me thinking how easily Mia could be me or friend or even a family member. I found myself having to take a few breaks because that's how much the book got to me and I cannot remember the last time that sort of thing happened while reading. There is no doubt about it. This book will definitely stick with you even when it's done. I highly suggest if you haven't picked this one up, go out and get it. While you're at it, you might want to grab a box of tissues.e last time that sort of thing happened while reading. There is no doubt about it.

0756404738|5.0|When I heard about this series I picked up the first volume and found it hard to put down.  The plot lines were tight and compelling and the story telling superb.  When I started this volume it went as fast in spite of its larger girth and now I have to sit around and wait for the third edition.  Damn!  Rothfuss is from my home state of Wisconsin and does us proud.  Buy it or borrow it and start reading and you'll see what I mean.
0061914177|5.0|Hello, Gary. I really enjoyed how you talk to people in your book vs talk at them. Its full of inspiration, and empowering ideas and--do it now! fire.  Most stuff written on being an entrepreneur is purely transactional stuff you can buy in a book store, the ten characteristics and traits of being an entrepreneur. The ten steps in starting a business. Good info, but not enough to awaken the entrepreneur within, and get them to jump into action.     I was really love Crush It because I see it as a transformational document. It helps bring out the entrepreneur within by getting people to follow their personal DNA code, their passion, talents, interests, and then look for an opportunity to start a business around that    I think this where the magic starts, becasue as people take a stand for a business idea that they passionately believe they begin to discover and call forth from within themsevles the qualities of entrepreneurship that most of us only know like a computer chip in the head. \\"Hey Ive got an idea for a great company, and I am finally going to take a risk and go for it.\\" The person who was there before, doesnt exist now. The person who is there now didnt exist before    Another really great idea in this book, is the concept that there has never been a better time to be an entrepreneur then now. I really liked the concept that its a fundamental tenet of the American dream, that everyone deserves a shot. Yet up until recently not everyone has had the opportunity given all the gates and gate keepers.    During the industrial era, the gate was getting enought capital to open a factory and the gate keeper was the banker. Later as we shifted to a service economy, the gates came down a bit, but were still really hard to tackle, especially for us consultants. It was too expensive too put ads in WSJ or New York times, and cold calling a guys secretary was the pits.    Now with the social media, the gate keepers are still there, and the gates too, but at least thereis a potential way to get around them through social media. I see how social media works in the retail market, but Gary I am not sure how it works in attracting the biz of Big Co's, and SMEs. I would think the idea is to focus blogs, tweets etc on the specific jobs business leaders need to get done.    Thanks Gary, you got our blood boiling!

0756405890|5.0|I heard Patrick Rothfuss on Wisconsin Public Radio and a colleague of mine from work had been telling me I should read this book for months before I heard the interview.  I got the book and couldn't believe the power of his story telling ability, especially for a first book.  I was bleary-eyed at work while I was reading because I couldn't put it down at night when I read!  As soon as the second volume came out I tore into it and now have to wait (hopefully not as long as the time between the first two volumes) because I can't stand not knowing how it will end.  There is nothing pat or cookie cutter about these volumes at all.  Tell me what you think...
0345495004|5.0|This read is a paradox.  The author does an excellent job with descriptions and environment, and about the middle of the book I regretted that I had spent the money and the time because of the personalities and some of their emotional and conversational details that seemed just Too Much Information, but I stayed with it because I wanted to experience the places the author gifts you. Then as I met the Swedish philosopher and MaMaw's reactions to her, it all started to make sense. I had to give serious thought to the Era it was written about. It really was the beginning of Women's freedom as individuals, the emergence of the family from the burdens of Victorian values, and women were beginning to seek their own personal happiness.  And, Frank.   Well, of course, Frank. He is what he is, Anna Wright or not, but I have lived with a genius and they are a different DNA. Not an excuse for his horrible behavior, but an understanding.  I now treasure this book as one of my favorites, and will go back though the back of the book for further inspiration of writings to spend my time with.
0307887960|1.0|I read the reviews about this book and was excited to order it.  I am looking to lose weight and wanted to do so quickly.  When i got the book and read it I followed it exactly as the author stated.  During the first several days of the Attack Phase I was losing about 1 pound per day, so were my mom and brother - we all went on the diet.  We decided to do the attack phase for 10 days since we wanted to lose over 40 lbs. each.  But the past 4 days we have not been loosing weight - in fact we have been gaining weight back.  Not by much - just fractions of a pound to 1 pound per day.  In the book he states that there will be a time when your weight loss will stagnant, but that is not suppose to happen until the Cruise Phase which we still had not gotten to.  And he says nothing about the weight coming back.      I reread the book, but there are so many inconsistencies in what he says that you feel a little unclear about what exactly you are suppose to do.  We did everything he stated; kept our menu limited to the foods in the Attack Phase only, 20 minutes of walking (sometimes more), 1 1/2 quarts of water daily, and the 1 1/2 TBSP of oat bran.      The majority of his \\"research\\" is not research, but only case studies of his own patients over the years.  There are things that he states in the book about the human body and food that are actually incorrect.      He also says not to eat anything that is not on the list for the Attack Phase, but in the recipes he has in the book for that phase he includes things like white wine, which he never mentioned was alright to use before.      He seems to make some things a little unclear and then directs you to his website, which when you go to you realize that you have to pay or subscribe to in order to get any answers.  It feels like a bit of a scam, which is ironic since in the beginning of the book he says that he grew during WWII and saw what the United States did for Europe and the Jews and was told by his father if he couldever show America his gratitude then he should do it.  He claims that his publishing his book in the U.S. was his way of showing his gratitude for what America did for them.      WOW!!!!!!!!!!  How selfless - he agrees to publish a book in the United States that was popular in Europe and makes a ton of money and instead of donating that money to causes here or to causes for service men or veterans of WWII he starts up an American website that people here have to pay more money for to get help.  So how he really goes about showing his gratitude for all those who died for him is thru his willingness to take your American money.  How noble!
0553582445|3.0|I think the main attraction to me was that I started at the end, and don't know how Fitz got his scars, or became friends with Fool among other things. Unlike most fantasy stories, characters were able to keep really valuable information from each other, and I spent part of the book holding my breath, waiting for someone to slip up. Otherwise, the characters carried an acceptable but hardly original story.
0123694965|5.0|The Art of Game Design is truly the only book on video game design that focuses on what makes a game good and not just the technical details.  As a self taught designer, I gathered my education from dozens of textbooks rented from the NYC Public Library system.  Many books can teach you how video games are made, but this is the only book I have ever come across that goes in depth about what turns a game into the experiences that you, as a designer, have fallen in love with.    As an example: I have read many books on how to create artwork for your game using technology such as Adobe Photoshop and similar technology.  Technical processes such as modeling or art design are not covered in The Art of Game Design.  Instead, you speak about the graphics and art design in terms of how your game functions as a whole.  How do the graphics and artwork inform the gameplay or the story?  What is it about certain art that creates inspiration in the player?  How can you put the inspiration that drove you to game design into that art?  This book isn't about what button on your computer to press to make a tree, it's about making magic.    Which isn't to say that the book isn't grounded in reality, because it most certainly is.  It covers both the creative approach to making games as well as the commercial and business know-how that it takes to get your game funded.  There's an absolute wealth of information in this book on the different factors that will affect your game, such as time and money, and how to deal with them without sacrificing your vision.    And the best part is it's actually readable!  I can't tell you how many books on games that either:  A) Make my eyes roll back in my head with crippling boredom  or  B) Present me with so much information I become self conscious about my own skill    Jesse is quite a bit of fun to read, and more importantly, he feels like a real human being and not some abstract, omnipotent nerd-god.  He is constantly encouraging you throughout the text and supporting you in your goals.  I felt like this book nurtured me, and I came out on the other end more confident in myself as a designer than I have ever been.    My final say:  I can honestly tell you that I had trouble finishing this book.  Why?  Because I couldn't go more than ten pages without running across a tip or perspective that made my drop the book and run to go work on my game, newly inspired.  If that doesn't deserve an endorsement then I don't know what does.
B004RLPWXS|5.0|I'm keeping this short.  This is a terrific album top-to-bottom.  I have all of DD's studio albums.  My top six favorite DD albums in chronological order are DD, Rio, Seven, Big Thing, Wedding, and Pop Trash.  This one easily fits into my favorites, probably muscling into top 4 of those 6.  It has the sound and vibe of the Rio album, and for many of the tracks they could easily be unreleased outtakes from the Rio recording sessions.    Buy it, it's $10 well spent.
0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It's a quick read, mostly because Katniss (or Kat) is a practical girl, and she tells the story as it is, in present-tense as it's happening. She doesn't use a lot of flowery language, and she doesn't do a lot of time sorting through her feelings or being confused (though that's not to say that she never is), or feeling sorry for herself.  She has depth, but it's as if she doesn't realize or care that she does.  That's just the way it is, and she doesn't spend time reflecting on this.  But she has a way of describing everything to a T with as few words as possible, and she does make some very interesting observations, especially about the people of the Capitol.  And her lack of over-emotionality makes her possibly the most normal and maturing teenage girl I've ever read.     For that reason, as well as for the social commentary (of which I hope there is more to come in the following two books), I wish every teenager would read this book.  The dystopian future and the fight for survival are interesting, but, like most YA novels, there are those stirring hormones to deal with.  It's confusing, even alarming, she doesn't know how she really feels about it, and it's normal.  There is no I'll-jump-off-a-cliff-because-you'll-come-save-me-or-if-not-I'd-rather-just-die nonsense.  Because guess what, kids; that's called obsession.  Obsession  love.  Obsession => stalking (and/or losing your soul and mortality, but that's quite literally another story).     This book also would make a very good intro to books that have something to say about current, present-day society but don't flat-out say it.  I remember having to be spoon-fed most of what's in books like Farenheit 451 the first time I read them in school, and I think this book would be a lot easier for kids to \\"get.\\"

B004SBB0LU|2.0|Being the 2nd reviewer for this set, and having read T. Fleming's enthusiastic post, I will now ministrate to my respective side of the hydrant.<br /><br />Ten years ago, I opted for the Queen catalog in Japan mini-sleeves, which I believe had Japan-dedicated remasters.  I never heard any of the artifacting in the Toshiba discs that Mr. Fleming speaks of in the European releases.  So, please remember as you are reading this, I do not have the domestic Hollywood or European releases, only the Japan discs: If you do not own those, you will probably not reach the same conclusions as I did.<br /><br />On the heels of those recent, terrible Rolling Stones \\"remasters\\", Universal has applied the same odious loudness compression method to another high profile catalog: Queen.  If you're not familiar with term, the technical explanation is the application of an increasingly high ratio of compression to the dynamic range of a particular recording, and then increasing the gain of the recording, until the peaks have reached maximum.<br /><br />In layman's terms: There are no longer any quiet or loud passages in the recording, EVERYTHING is at the same volume.  Go to Wikipedia and search \\"loudness wars\\". In that article, there is also a link to an excellent You Tube audio/video demonstration.<br /><br />Basically, the ubiquity of the iPod is the culprit in this plague: When music is played back thru earbuds in any environment with ambient noise present, by having the volume artificially jacked across the entire music spectrum, you can hear the content more clearly.<br /><br />When you listen to these new Queen editions in a home system, however, it's just a sheer wall of high volume sound; there is no dynamic range remaining.  The vocals, instrumentation and orchestrations are all now in competition, rather than being in harmony, with each other, and the overall volume of each album is much louder than the previous versions.  There is also a noticeable loss of clarity in the cymbals on the 2011 releases; they sound much sharper on the Japan discs.<br /><br />All of this adds up to a real heartbreaker, because a lot of the bonus material is excellent, and Queen fans have been waiting for a long time for this kind of look under the hood.<br /><br />There was also no reason to split the bonus material to a 2nd disc on any of these releases, other than to charge a higher price for each title.  None of these albums with their respective bonus material approach the full capacity of a CD.  There was even room on each album disc to include not only the new bonus material, but also the bonus tracks from the earlier editions.

Even with lots of head fakes, I never changed my mind. The main character Det. Harry Hole is a very good character and the supporting cast is pretty good too. I would wait for the price to down and get the paper back.
B001N26GFM|5.0|This is a very moving movie. It touches every piece of your heart! I could not hold back the tears for both boys in this movie! These two children actors were GREAT and should have won an award. I give this this movie 5 stars and although I don't think it was based on actual facts, it was based on actual facts of what happened in the most terrible times of that terrible war with Hitler in control. This movie is for anyone who really wants to see a movie that is extraordinary in touching your heart. The picture quality is also great in the dvd. Thanks Amazon for another great dvd!
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|boring to the hilt in some ways, but i'd give it a 8.5 for the movies ability to keep me glued to the end...
0061801313|1.0|For a \\"Young Adult\\" book I would never let my child read this. Underage girls are being intimate with adult men and experimenting with the same sex (girl on girl kissing and fondling), as well as underage drinking, drug use and shoplifting.  I can hardly believe that this is a tv show on ABC Family.  These young girls are not role models and definitely not anything I would want my child to be exposed to at a formidable age.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|Oh hell yes!  Never finer, and I have them all.  Beautifully shot, impeccable audio, completely immersive.  This is \\"No Bull\\" on afterburners.
0545123275|4.0|A note:  know what you are getting into if your read this book. It is a slightly sappy teen supernatural love story about a girl and a werewolf.  Accept it as such, and it's pretty good.  I have also tried really hard to not put spoilers in this review, so if it's a little confusing I apologize.    I think I need to read up on Maggie Stiefvater, the author of Shiver. Because from where I'm reading, it looks an awful lot like Stiefvater read Twilight and then said to herself, \\"Hm. A book about a mostly-averge teenage girl who grows up with immature parents who don't really let her have a childhood or pay much attention to her who falls in love with a supernatural boy that she probably shouldn't be in a relationship with because the supernatural forces surrounding him want to tear them apart. Yeah. I can do that WAY better.\\"    I stalk a wide variety of book blogs, and most of them were crazy about Shiver a few weeks ago (probably because Scholastic announced the July 20th release date for the sequel, Linger, a few weeks ago). I was very skeptical, mostly because I despise Twilight and will lecture you about its flaws until I am blue in the face, not the least of which is its unhealthy promotion of obsessive first-love as the \\"ideal.\\" But the reviewers (whose opinions I generally respect, and who are predominately rational adult women and not crazy tweens) only had high praises for it. And I have to say I agree with them. Shiver is a lot like what Twilight could have been.    First off, let's look at the basis for the love between Sam and Grace. Grace is attacked by a pack of wolves near her Minnesota house when she is eleven or so, but one of the wolves doesn't attack her. As the rest of the pack is about to kill her, this one wolf pulls her to safety. For the next six years, she sees this wolf around her house every winter, watching over her like a furry guardian. When a local boy is killed by the pack, the authorities go out to hunt the wolves... and a naked guy with a bullet wound on his neck turns up on Grace's porch. One look at his yellow eyes is all Grace needs to recognize her wolf, who goes by the name of Sam when he's human. They both fall instantly in love, but (and this is key) there's a basis for it. Reciprocated life-saving I'll buy as a means of falling in love.    And character development! Both Sam and Grace come from slightly messed-up families, though I won't elaborate on Sam's past here because I think Stiefvater does such a fabulous job unfurling that backstory that I want you to experience it first-hand. Grace is, admittedly, less developed than Sam, but she's still a big step up from Bella. More on that in a bit.    I'm on the fence about the depiction of love in this book. I love that both characters admit that they're kind of obsessed with the other person maybe just a little too much, and how it may be considered a little creepy that Sam has been watching her pretty much every day of winter for six years.    For example:  Sam laughed, a funny, self-deprecating laugh. \\"You did read a lot. And spent too much time just inside the kitchen window, where I couldn't see you very well.\\"  \\"And not enough time mostly naked in front of my bedroom window?\\" I teased.  Sam turned bright red. \\"That,\\" he said \\"is so not the point of this conversation.\\"    And to be fair, it isn't the point. Sam had a reason for watching her, which he is about to reveal. They have a lot of high school-esque romantic moments, but it's balanced with some more grown-up, practical romantic moments, mostly when one is trying to help the other deal with emotional baggage stemming from family issues. One of these instances I loved was their relationship's maturity in this one scene where Sam makes breakfast for Grace. Since Grace is essentially the only adult in the house, she usually does everything for herself, including cook. And here he is, making a thing she doesn't like in a way that she's sure to like it. They tease and flirt a little,but it has this ring of a more mature symbiotic relationship-- a team of two independent people looking out for each other-- as opposed to some of the more patronizing scenes in Twilight where Edward deliberately does things like cook for Bella because she sometimes forgets to eat, she's just so gosh darn in love with him. Don't get me wrong-- Shiver is still a story about obsessive teenage love (and we can argue the cultural and feminist significance of that for a while if you want), but I feel like Stiefvater pulls it out of the creepy, abusive-relationship-place of Twilight and makes it a bit more about the emotional co-dependence of two slightly damaged outsiders.    The suspense of what will happen to the wolf pack (both because of the hunters and because of pack-politics) and whether or not Sam and Grace can stay together (also for multiple reasons) and the fact that romantic readers will just like seeing Sam and Grace together makes Shiver a page-turning read. I literally had to tear myself away from it, promising myself that I could return to that world and the mysteries of the plot (do you hear that Smeyer? Plot! With stakes!) only after I had finished my Business Law reading. The plots that don't revolve around keeping Sam human kind of fizzle, but there's enough tension there still that I think Stiefvater will come back to them in later books. Or at least, I hope so, because they're the interesting parts.    As far as characters go, I like Sam and Beck, and I was fond of the role that Isabel takes towards the end of the book, probably because once she stops being such a \\"plastic,\\" to steal a term from Mean Girls, she reminds me a bit of Aidyn (the main character in the novel I'm working on). Also, please note the interactions between Isabel and Grace at the end of the book, compare that to New Moon and get back to me.    Grace is a bit of the \\"every-girl\\" character, and some may see her as a little bland, apart from her overpowering love for Sam, but I'mwilling to overlook the blandness (at least for this first book of a projected trilogy) because of her issues with her parents. She admits to Sam that she tries to be the bland, perfect girl in order to win their affection. Some may see bad writing, I personally see a girl who tries to make as few waves as possible in order to get people to like her. Does this mean that she doesn't have very many hobbies or blatant personality traits (unlike Sam, who composes song lyrics in his head pretty regularly)? Yeah. But based on her friendship with Isabel at the end of the book as Isabel attempts to teach Grace how to browse properly, I think Grace could develop more of a personality as she grows from an awkward teenager needing approval into a young woman with a penchant for cooking and an excellent sense of smell (the candy store scene was pretty awesome, and beautifully written). In short, Grace is capable of functioning as an individual outside of her relationship with Sam, though she often chooses otherwise. Of course, I initially didn't mind Twilight, and apart from the cop-out \\"I can't write an action scene\\" ending of the plot, thought it was ok. And then the sequels happened, and my head imploded. So we shall see what Maggie Stiefvater has in store for us in July, and then I shall make more of a solid decision about her work.    All in all, if I'm bribing myself with being able to finish the book, I think that deserves at least a 8 on a scale of 0-10.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|This was a blast.  A friend from work brought it up one day at lunch and for less than $4 I had to see what she was on about.  It was an insightful look at the way we thought about nuclear war in 1983.    Thanks for the fast delivery!
0060853972|4.0|Good Omens is the first book by Neil Gaimen or Terry Pratchett that I have ever read.  Their writing style was a bit different than I was expecting, but it runs in the same hardcore British-humor vein as Hitchhiker's Guide.  In fact, it's a lot like A Hitchhiker's Guide, but with a cohesive plot (of which I am a fan).  The jist of the book is that the end of the world is upon us, but an angel and a demon screwed up eleven years ago and misplaced the Anti-Christ.  That sounds very dry and Bible-Thumpery, but Gaimen and Pratchett keep it interesting by letting us look into the private lives of his angel and demon and adding personal touches (such as the tape deck n the demon's car that slowly changes every tape into Queen's Greatest Hits).    In short, this book is so good that instead of attempting to slay Joyce's Ulysses last night, I stayed up until 1:30 am to finish this book.
B00005ARDC|5.0|I ran across this group one day completely by accident and loved the sound.  A little research and wham-o! My new favorite album.
0312944926|3.0|I picked up Digital Fortress by Dan Brown, mostly because it was in the house and because I needed a tiny break from \\"Literature.\\"  My dad had said that once I started, I would have to read it straight through. This was kind of true.  The book was really slow to start out, in my opinion-- especially the sections that followed David Becker.  After being led on an endless goosechase through Seville only to coincidentally find what you're looking for?  After you've worked so hard at trying to find the ring logically?  But oh well.  The action sequences that followed were worth a bit of coincidence.    I really did appreciate the \\"twist,\\" mostly because it was both expected and still details of it were surprising.  The last 75 pages or so did give me that intense, page-turned feel that my father had described.  All in all, not a bad weekend-read, and it has me a little psyched to read The Lost Symbol.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Ok.  America went down.  Ruined.  Bad Economy.  Now it is controlled by the \\"Capitol\\" populated by rich, fashionable, but oh-so-shallow people.  Anyway, the idea of entertainment for the capitol crowd is to force each of the 13 Districts to send a boy and a girl to compete in an annual TV reality show, the hunger game.  This fun-for-the- family game ends when only one participant remains alive.  But wait, this is not only for fun.  The capitol is actually devised this game as a mean to control the Districts--to show them who's the boss.  Genius?  It's pretty weird too me.  But anyway, let's proceed on this assumption.    Our girl, Katniss, enters the game (obviously).  She is a strong girl who hunts illegally to provide for her family.  Katniss is strikingly beautiful and can sing with such voice that she attracts a serious secret admirer (guess who?).  Of course she does not realize any of these.  She and a boy from her district, Peeta, enter the game, faking romance to keep the audience's support (somehow these people don't guess this; no clues that this is like a staple of reality T.V.), and getting confused (do I love him or do I want to kill him?  Does he love me or does he want to kill me?) for the rest of the book.  Fun to read, definitely.  Can't say I like it.  For sure this is not a good YA book.  Is this the next Harry Potter?  Noooooo!  The  way Collins writes annoys me.  She \\"tells\\" A LOT more than \\"shows\\".  Take her words for it.  Katniss loves Prim enough to painfully die (ok potentially die, probably painfully).  Katniss has this connection with Gale (another pointy end of the ensuing love triangle).  Not to worry that there isn't much interaction between them shown in the book.  Why not showing us these things a little bit up front (of wherever, I am not picky) so we would see why Katniss enters the game and why she is confused with her feeling for Peeta for the rest of the book.  By the way we get loads of details on what she eats at parties and what she wears to each T.V. appearance.  This kind of writing (trust Collins, it is so) carries through throughout the book.  Peeta is good at jokes and banters.  How about coming up with some jokes and banters and let us see for ourselves if Peeta is any good?    The writing is not tidy.  I know.  Two more books to follow.  But what about those who do not want to read anymore?  There are obvious clues about an Avox girl, the 13th District, and the mockingjay that are just left hanging there.  Collins does not even try.  I hate clues left hanging there.  I know.  More books to come.  But aren't you supposed to end the book properly still? (Listen up, Rick Riordan!  I am talking about you too.) Read Harry Potter.  J.K. clues in earlier books are so well-placed and well-written that you (I mean, I) don't  realized until they are revealed later (the hidden diadem, the invisibility cloak, Regulus and Sirius Black, and the whole horcruxes thing).  And J.K. doesn't give up trying like four different bloody ways to explain what quidditch is in each of the first four books.  Each Harry Potter book is self-contained.  That's tidy writing.  No such attempt here.          Collins also relies much on luck.  Wouldn't it be better if Peeta volunteered to the game instead of being randomly chosen and Katniss was shown to be exceptional or smart from the beginning?  As is, she was good at hunting and came through a difficult childhood but is that enough?  Why should I believe that she has a chance to win? (Er yes she wins) She happened to have a brilliant stylist, have Peeta at her feet, and the drunk mentor she has turns out to be a genius who can read her mind and she his.      Anything more I don't like?  Well, just Katniss and Peeta.  They are dull and completely uninspiring.  Killing does not seem to bother them.  Again, Harry Potter is about friendship and courage and responsibility and sacrifice.  Harry actually thinks about his life (which sucks badly) and what he wants to doabout it.  It is emphasized over and over that it is not fate but our choice that matters at the end.  It is uplifting to read.  Each death (not caused by him) bothers Harry to no end.  And he saved the world with Expelliarmus!   As for Katniss and Peeta, they killed or witnessed killing and they were like \\"eh, too bad, sad day for the deader\\" and went on worrying about their teenage love triangle.  YA, really?     By the way, none of the participants of the \\"hunger game\\" actually went too hungry at any time.  Food is plentifully available if you are willing to fight or steal.  Also you can get rice and tasty lamb stew from the sky if you just make out with your love interest.       If you have not guessed, Peeta is very corny.  It seems he doesn't know that either.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|First off, do not listen to the reviews saying it lost air or broke within the first week or so. We all know by the grammar and spelling they use that they aren't capable of reading directions and probably placed it right on a rock or inflated it too much. So, because of their incompetence they come back here and yell things like \\"Great... if you love crappy exploding, pools.\\" Or \\"stinky turd of a product.\\" The other review even goes on to say that they were not even in the pool, or around it when this rip happened. Well, let's put on our third grade thinking caps and think of reasons an inflatable toy pops when you are not watching it: Maybe an animal clawed at it, wind blew something sharp into it, mischievous neighborhood bully ran into the yard and popped it because your son kicked him in the balls the day before, etc etc. There are hundreds of reasons something can pop without you looking at it. Someone without the intelligence level to know this should not be allowed to bad mouth products because of their incompetence. But this is the internet and unfortunately they get loose around here from time to time.    Now, on to my actual review:  - This took all of 5 minutes to blow up. Again, I am baffled at other reviews saying it takes too long to blow up... Seriously folks you cannot handle a few air holes, there was 6 I think... *facepalm*    - It is HUGE! So much area for kids to play in. I was surprised at how big it actually was after inflating it.    - The toys that come with it are great! My daughter absolutely loves the turtle. Look out though there are more things to put air in, the other reviewers would be ripping their hair out at this fact!    - The little sprinklers that surround it that shoot up water really surprised me. Obviously your water pressure will differ and may make them less powerful but mine were shooting 6-7 feet in the air!!    - The slide works great if you have the sprinklers on because they keep it wet. Everyone else saying the slidesucks need to think about physics. Skin + an inflatable slide = stop. You will not slide down this material dry, for obvious reasons. But if you and/or the slide are wet, it works great.    I don't know what else to say so I will stop there. Loving this product and my daughter and her friends love splashing around in it when it gets hot out. It is an absolute steal at 30 bucks for something this nice!!
B00138D1I6|5.0|Loved just about every track on here. Probably the best of the trilogy in my opinion. The film was a little iffy, but I could watch it just to hear the soundtrack and be pleased. It's actually a bit overwhelmingly good. There's so many good tracks it's hard to pick a favorite! But tracks that folks will really love are 03, At Wit's End, 05 - Up is Down, 08 - Parley, 10 - What Shall we Die For?, 11 - I Don't Think Now is the Best Time, 12 - One Day, and 13 - Drink Up Me Hearties Yo Ho!    Stellar album. All composers should try to aspire to Zimmer
B001EBIRZE|5.0|I am a 2nd grade teacher and of course I could not believe the comments stated by the principal.  I could'nt help but laugh because we all know that if a teacher or principal were to act like that they would absolutely be thrown  in jail.  My daughter is also in 2nd grade and she thought the movie was hilarious because she doesn't believe that any parent or principal really acts so extremely dispicable. The dialogue coming from the principal is jaw dropping to the point of hilarity. I have watched the movie 3 times in 24 hours so I can remember the hilarious hyjinx spoken by the parents and principal. Matilda's \\"revenge\\" amuses a child's most extreme fantasy. They also find it shocking yet amusing.
0439023491|4.0|This book was kind of a disappointment for me. I'd heard SO MUCH about Catching Fire that I don't know what I was expecting- just something unbelievably mind-blowing I guess. Something like The Hunger Games. The last 2 chapters of the book were just that- and nearly made me give it 4 stars, but then I remembered the other 25 chapters of the book and I went back to my original rating. Thankfully however, this books sets the stage for Mockingjay to be (hopefully) incredible.<br /><br />To start off with the good, Suzanne Collins has the most amazing ideas in the world. I could never come up with any of that and I'm always impressed by her creativity and knowledge. With that being said, I feel as though her writing is slightly mechanical. Blunt, straight, sentences that deliver plot directly. I'm not sure if this is just the way you have to write an action-packed story (you can't be caught up in descriptive, lovely prose all the time, right?) or if it's just her writing style. It took awhile to get used to it, but then I was back to pretending I was Katniss and all was well. :)<br /><br />I loved the bits of Gale that were in the book, but at the same time, I hated them. Why? Because they were BITS of Gale. I want chapters and novels and encyclopedias devoted to Gale. But she had to write about the plot or something. Psh. Whatever.<br /><br />The characters were great and I came to find each one endearing in his/her own way. I felt Katniss' pain during losses and felt her joy during happy times. I came to grow extremely fond of Peeta in this book, which is different from how I felt towards him in The Hunger Games. The major twists in the book were unexpected and well done, they left me intrigued and wanting more. And of course, you can't NOT start Mockingjay immediately after Catching Fire simply because of the way Collins ends it. :P<br /><br />So, the bad? I felt that this entire book was just filler material. Yes, things happened, and yes, in retrospect I realize why she needed filler material (again, sets the stage for Mockingjay awesomeness) but filler stuff is never fun to read through. I remember being nearly done with the book and thinking, \\"But...I'm almost done and...nothing's happened yet. O_O\\" There's Collins-style kabooms at the end that leave you looking like this ---> :O but the majority of the book is filler.<br /><br />Despite that, I'd like to start Mockingjay as soon as possible. I'd also like a nice big order of Gale please. Maybe a lifetime's supply. Thanks.y she needed filler material (again, sets the stage for Mockingjay awesomeness) but filler stuff is never fun to read through.

B003UESJH4|5.0|This is for anyone interested in an excellent story that spices up the typical Hollywood formula with perfect acting by the three main players. Altogether, the film works as an exemplary formula film, an idea explored in [[ASIN:160020046X The 90-Minute Effect: How We Shape Our Lives by the Hollywood Formula and Rarely Reach Our Own Happy Endings]]. And this is not to criticize or condemn it, but rather to show how universal it is. The formula is absolutely necessary for all good stories. And the awards this film has won prove this.   For those interested in the plot points, I offer the following with a spoiler alert:  ---Spoilers---  Setting  The Duke of York has a speech problem.  Call to Action  Faced with rising public duties, he decides to find help.  New Location  Unable to find qualified therapists, the duke and duchess turn to Lionel, who is known for his unorthodoxy and success.  Inciting Incident  Lionel agrees to help when the duke admits he wants to fix it.  Progress  The duke makes progress with the help of Lionel, though pressures mount as the king grows ill.  Point of No Return  The king dies, making the duke's irresponsible brother the new king.  Escalation  With the duke's brother philandering and war looming, the duke's speech relapses.  Major Setback  Lionel makes treasonous suggestion that duke should be king, at which point the duke alienates himself from Lionel just when he needs him most.  Final Push  As duke's brother abdicates, the duke becomes king and assumes prominent speaking role, thus requiring Lionel's help more than ever.  Climax  Upon declaration of war with Germany, the king summons Lionel to assist in a radio speech.  Aftermath  The king offers support to people with several speeches throughout war; he and Lionel remain friends for the rest of their lives.
006621131X|5.0|I Loved this book. Patti Smith's writing is amazing, as is her story. She lovingly describes her relationship with Robert, their development as artists, and the New York scene of the 1960's-1970's. Inspiring and beautiful.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I had always used the OEM cooler that arrived with my AMD Phenom 965 BE, but on a quest to improve performance i decided to go with this cooler. My choice was not regretted. Having a decently sized case(Antec 900), I was able to fit this guy in after taking the motherboard out to place the backplate. With the expanded dual fan, I get around 40C with all my fans on low. Under load I reach around 53 degrees. But that's not including one thing. I have my Phenom overclocked from 3.6 GHz to 4.1 GHz. If I run all my fans on high I can crank the overclock to around 4.4 but my case sounds like a jet engine with all the wind. All in all, I'm very pleased with this cooler and would recommend to anyone looking for the best air cooling for the price. Some minor cons include as people have said:    *instructions are kind of vague, but anyone with basic PC skills should have no problem figuring it out.    *It is BIG. Like really big. I have to sacrifice my side fan on my case with this bad boy, but the dual fan push-pull you get is amazing.   *My motherboard (Asus M4A79 Deluxe) reports a cpu fan error on boot, but the fan works correctly. Probably due to the fact the fan is 120 mm. I just turned off pause on error in BIOS and all is good.     I can't seem to convey how absolutely amazing this cooler is for the price. Don't second guess yourself, buy this and you will not be disappointed!
B003VANOFY|5.0|The sound equality is a 10/10, it's nice that it charges and you can use it while at charging, but I just charge it over night cuz the whole purpose of me buying this was for a wireless headphone. This headset is just as I expected, but if I HAD to improve this I would say    - no auto turn off (this is prob. one of the most thing people hate about this headphone, when theres no audio playing on your PC for about 5-10 minutes it automatic turn off, you might think that is cool and save battery, but it's extemely annoying to have to keep taking off the headphone and turn it back on, the turn on button in pushed in the headset and it will take about 3 seconds of hold to turn it back on and you can't really do it while the headphone is over your head)    - longer battery (you get about 9-10 hours of headphone use which is really not bad)    - smaller size (the headset is big, bigger than I expected, it's about 2 inches wide on the part that goes over your ears)    - smaller USB plug for laptop (I use a laptop and the piece is about an inch and a half long, which isn't a big deal with PC, but for laptop it's about annoying)    Ok thats about it for me, I was being really picky about it, these things aren't big deal, overall I'm pleased with it.

0756404738|3.0|I read The Wise Man's Fear hoping to recapture the magic, awesome feeling I'd had while reading the Name of the Wind... and, while, irrefutably, the book is impeccably authored, I came away with the feeling... that it was similar to \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\", mixed with a dash of Hogwarts.    What do I mean by this?  As with Crossroads of Twilight, the sentences are carefully and lovingly written... sentence after sentence of them.  Detailed prose, carrying to scene after scene.. in which nothing .. truly happens?      Most importantly, as with the brilliant Harry Potter series.... I never felt risk for the protagonist (Kvothe)... and while that's implicitly understood as the series is in first person... (and, of course, the ~50% of time spent at the University... all we needed were some direct references to Butterbeer) that doesn't mean that risk, and courage, and emotions are absent in the perspective (see Fitz from Robin Hobb's Farseer series, for example).    I have high hopes that there will be both a shorter turn around until book 3 and that book 3 will work to better tie the first 2 books into an emotive stance- such as that hinted at during the interlude's classic line 'this is not that type of story'.      Truly, I hope not.   I hope that Patrick Rothfuss can meet the weight of expectations that his opening classic brought about.   I hope, and I believe... but this book- were it from a music band- may well be coined 'a sophomore' slump.
0061537969|5.0|I would love to tell you why, but many of the other reviews have been so well written that I won't even try, I'll just say, 'GO READ THIS BOOK'.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|Another great Harry Potter Movie. It everything you could want and it sets up the story for the grand finale. The only negative is that some parts are really boring (when they are camping) but everything else is great.
B004132HZS|4.0|As a die hard Holmes fan since childhood and a great lover of the series with Jeremy Brett i was blown away by this bold new version of Sherlock. Finally a Sherlock who is the same age as i am. I am also an Advanced Placement English Lit teacher and i use the stories in my classroom all of the time. I would definitely use this series to introduce my students to the Doyle versions. Cumberbatch is fantastic in the title role and Freeman is wonderful as Watson. They bring enthusiasm and intelligence to the roles that is seen in few adaptations even the Guy Ritchie one, which i liked. Cumberbatch is more like the Sherlock of the books than Downey Jr. in the fact that he shows icy demeanor with loveable wit and intelligence at the same time. He physically looks more the part as well. This version is fast, funny and addictive. Highly recommended to fans of mysteries or Holmes in general. Buy it today!
B0010T3UV6|4.0|I am a waitress at Village Inn. We are required to wear non slip shoes. When i started the position,I quickly went out to Wal-Mart and bought thier brand of non slip non marking work shoes. My feet hurt mid-shift, and my heels became horribly cracked.   Today I wore my brand new crocs to work and WOW what a difference that made in my work day!  My only complaint is that my feet were pretty sweaty by the end of the shift. My feet do not sweat overmuch, but i do live in Texas and it is in the upper 80's today and the store i work at rarely turns on the air conditioning.   Lovin these Crocs, and management had no complaint.

B003QTBT5C|3.0|This CD isn't bad, although I find it to be a bit too mainstream for my taste. I liked their older works better where the cellos sounded more hard and heavy. Not a bad CD by any means, just not to my taste.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|OMG This is a GREAT story!!! Book #1 made me happy & wanting more. Book #2 made me mad & I really need to find out the truth! Book 3 made everything GOOD & BETTER. Now I'm reading #4 & OMG It's odd BUT IT'S GOOD! Just get them & read them....TRUST ME HERE PEOPLE!! If you like Harry Potter & Twilight, YOU WILL LOVE THE CITY BOOKS!!!!!
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Chuck is the best show ever! Hope season 5 gets an overwhelming amount of viewers and they change there minds and keep it on for more seasons!! This is literally the only show I watch! Busy on Monday nights, so we set the channel to get the viewing then watch it Tuesday nights on nbc.com  one of the highlights of my week :)
B0030U1U6A|5.0|Gentle Giant's In Glass House is amazing from the start. It challenges with creative song structure and instrumentation. The only sad thing is that their albums are all pretty much less than 40 minutes (it was the 70s and that was standard album length). I just want the great music to keep going. Intricate and progressive, this is far from being \\"Gentle\\". Highly recommended!
B000KZBRG6|5.0|I purchased this little beauty because I needed a meter for my Zenza Bronica STRsi. It is very lightweight and is very accurate, not surprising as it's a Sekonic. It mounts atop the hot shoe so you don't have it dangling around your neck, slapping into everything. I recommend it highly. Rich Maher
B001G5ZKZS|4.0|Geddy is the man on bass- he rips through the songs with the greatest of ease. Alex and Neil are awesome too. The song choice is good featuring some gems like Mission, Circumstances, Between the Wheels and A Passage to Bangkok. There are some times when Alex's guitar drowns everyone out. But then again, I've seen them live several times and this has always been the case at times. Overall, I would recommend. The Snake and Arrows songs are pretty good too especially Armor and Sword. It's great that these guys are \\"Endlessly Rockin'\\" !
B0034G4OUO|4.0|after being released from a 10 year stint in prison for a robbery gone wrong, Dwayne Johnson's character \\"Driver\\" goes a killing spree to kill those that killed his brother during the robbery.<br /><br />if you are in the mood for a action movie, then this is just what the doctor ordered.  Car chase scenes, violence, villians, beautiful women, and general mayhem abound in this actioner.<br /><br />An impressive supporting cast, including Billy Bob Thornton and Carla Gugino round out the characters.  Billy Bob and Carla play detectives trying to stop \\"Driver\\" from killing any more, and at the same time discover his motivation for doing so.  (I must add that Carla Gugino is an incredibly beautiful woman and that I am a big fan of her films).<br /><br />don't want to give away the plot, but the movie does have a moral message at the end somewhat when \\"Driver\\" learns that getting even with others will now leave its own scars on his psyche, and that he'll have to carry those scars with him.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great eBay app. It allows you to search, check on watched items, watch items, and it even pop ups a notification when one of your watched items is ending soon. Great app!
B000005AYL|4.0|Although the album looks like a cheap bootleg vinyl with a sticker placed on a black cover and some residual pieces of yellow paper from the label cooked in the pressing in the middle of a track, it really sounds good and is a pleasure to own and show your friends. Obvioulsy it sounds a little better than the cd version but if you don't have a real good turntable you'll probably won't hear any improvements in the funky atmosphere that surrounds the tracks. With vinyls you should keep in mind that you really need a good equipment to extract the sound from the grooves in the proper way or you'll be disappointed. But you won't be disappointed by this true classic record. A must have.
1594744769|5.0|When I first heard of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs with its intriguing title, cover, and premise, I was immediately smitten.  I love odd books and this one seemed unique in every way.  I'm very glad to report that Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was so enthralling that it overcame jet lag from a 10-hour plane ride - I just had to read to the end!    Jacob has always been in awe of his colorful Grandpa Portman, who told him stories about his fabled childhood in a faraway island where he lived in order to hide from monsters.  Jacob first believed in his grandfather's extraordinary tales of his friends, strange orphans with magical abilities, especially since his grandfather had photographs as proof of their existence.  However, as he grew older, Jacob began to doubt that the stories, the orphans, or the photographs, were real...until his grandfather's cryptic last words and a letter from a mysterious Miss Peregrine spur Jacob to search for his grandfather's childhood home, which turns out to be in a small island off the coast of Wales.  What he finds there is completely unexpected.    \\"The trees parted like a curtain and suddenly there it was, cloaked in fog, looming atop a weed-choked hill.  The house.  I understood at once why the boys had refused to come.    \\"My grandfather had described it a hundred times, but in his stories, the house was always a bright, happy place---big and rambling, yes but full of light and laughter.  What stood before me now was no refuge from monsters, but a monster itself, staring down from its perch with vacant hunger.  Trees burst forth from broken windows and skins of scabrous vine gnawed at the walls like antibodies attacking a virus--as if nature itself had waged war against it---but the house seemed unkillable, resolutely upright despite the wrongness of its angles and the jagged teeth of sky visible through sections of collapsed roof.    ...    \\"I gathered up what scrawny courage I had andwaded through waist-high weeds to the porch, all broken tile and rotting wood, to peek through a cracked window.  All I could make out through the smeared glass were the outlines of furniture, so I knocked on the door and stood back to wait in eerie silence, tracing the shape of Miss Peregrine's letter in my pocket.  I'd taken it along in case I needed to prove who I was, but as a minute ticked by, then two, it seemed less and less likely that I would need it.\\"    What happened to the inhabitants of this devastated ruin and how was Grandfather Portman involved?  Jacob's investigation turns from creepy to heart-palpitatingly scary, then poignant.  Where the story went truly surprised me, not only delivering on its promise of eccentric and dark but inventing a rich and magical other world of \\"peculiar\\" children and monsters that's convincingly woven with real history.      The writing is so descriptive and evocative that I now question if the vintage photographs interspersed throughout the narratives are even necessary to the enjoyment of the story.  Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was apparently inspired by these weird photographs the author found, each with something so off-kilter about them that they can inspire multiple fantastic stories on their own.  While I loved the photographs, they were a bonus rather than essential.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I love the series, i like the story line the Brutality and the action scenes and the nudity in my personal opinion is the best series right now in television, supass 300 the movie, is just Epic i suggest to not watch in from of minors, Sparticus is a master Piece series, evolve you in to the series, i am going to repeat the word is just EPIC.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|This soundtrack did not win the Academy Award it was nominated for, but it should have.<br /><br />The J&oacute;nsi track near the end (over the credits) has been moved on my iPod to accompany his most recent CD ([[ASIN:B0037AGAV8 Go]]) -- excellent in its own right, as you might have heard on a Ford Explorer commercial -- but the rest of this CD is simply gorgeous, emotional theater music.<br /><br />Like the musical Scots accents of the Viking adults in the film -- a bit puzzling when the kids have a flat accent, but what the heck? -- Mr. Powell invokes Celtic melodies with strings, whistles, flutes and woodwinds. I would have purchased this soundtrack for \\"Test Drive\\" alone (accompanying Hiccup's first flat-out ride on Toothless). It gives me chills. Likewise, \\"Romantic Flight\\" is just that.<br /><br />(The formerly proprietary-to-Samsung 3D Blu Ray disc of How to Train Your Dragon is a lot of fun, too. It is now being offered by one of the large electronic box stores.)<br /><br />To me this is the best soundtrack since Star Wars and since the Windham Hill tinged Country.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Like most movie adaptations it doesn't play out just like the books; however, it's a fun ride. I actually saw this just before getting the books (intended to do it the other way around) and thought it was a blast.     Yes they simplified the plot, yes the cut out some of the side items and explanations, but overall the movie is a fun, silly and solid ride. On BD all the silly comic style graphics and fighting look great and I really feel they kept a lot of the verbal style the same.    If you like fun witty movie, get it, it's worth it
B0001ARCFA|4.0|Pros: Highs and mids are excellent. When I put on black eyed peas it sounds like every instrument has room to \\"breathe.\\"<br /><br />Cons: Compared to sealed off headphones they don't have that much bass. HOWEVER the bass is very clear. To paint a picture it's almost the same sound they might hear in the studio compared to music in a club.<br /><br />Compared to my bose AE-1 the k-240s have less bass but that is for a reason. Bose have a closed and angled driver while these are way more open.<br /><br />Compared to audio technica AD 300, the mid and highs aren't as crystal clear like I would've hoped however my AD 300 leaked way more sound and when some songs that played had TOO much dynamic range I could hear the headset be distorted.<br /><br />I will come back to this review when I build a cmoy active amplifer made for 55-ohm headphones. Right now i'm playing it off my ipod touch 4th gen. I'm sure they amp will give more breathing room to the headphones.<br /><br />NOTE: they say this headphones are ready for digital devices. In my opinion this is NOT true. The amp in digital devices are made to drive (20-40)-ohm headphones like earbuds they sell with those devices. If you wanna take advantage of these headphones you will need to buy or make your own headphone amp. If you like bass in your music with these types of headphones I recommend buying a cmoy BB amp(BB=bass boost). Its a very hi quality amp and a great project for DIYers for $50 or you can buy it pre-made for a $80 (including shipping).
1607886278|5.0|A friend recommended this book, so I purchased the audio cd.  I listen to cd's in my car as I travel around town.  The story was riveting.  At one point I took the cd out of the car and brought it in the house to continue.  As good as my friend said the book was, the audio was infinitely better.  The voice of five year old Jack took you to his every thought and emotion.  When it was over I was tempted to put it in the player and start again.  If you are considering this book, please give thought to the audio cd.  Well worth the price.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Who but Johnny Depp could maintain two characters throughout nearly an entire movie? I love the chemistry between these two. It's easy to enjoy with the backdrop of this elegant, smart film! Please more movies like this and less gore and reality nonsense!!! A definite \\"watch it more than once\\" movie.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|what I would do for Prince to do another album as amazing as this my god. This album is perfection it is jazzy funky fun serious sooo adult with a childlike playfullness. This album has musicianship we never hear anymore please please i need a chapter two or another album like this i know its in you. I cant pick out favorite tracks there are so many this is tight funky jazz with an electro vibe i swear i cant get enough of this album aside from \\"lovesexy\\" it is quickly becoming my most played album.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Do you love science?  Do you love comedy?  How about comedy about science?  Well then this is the show for you.  I fell in love with this show from the first episode.  The character are believable for the most part.  I do know quiet a few physicist that don't fit the Sheldon and Leonard mold though and are not as socially inept as they are.  It does help with the comedy if you understand some of the science they talk about.  If you have not yet discovered the joy that is The Big Bang Theory then buy all the seasons and do so.  It is worth it.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|Sounds like one I'd like to read someday. For now, at $14.99, it's on my Wish List instead of on my Kindle.    What I do is put samples of any new books I'm interested in reading that are $9.99 or less on my reader, ready for purchase once I check out their samples.    The ones that are over $9.99 simply go to my Wish List, which, every now and then, I go through in reverse order looking for any who's prices have dropped to an acceptable level.    It's really a shame some authors and publishers would rather be wished for than read.    Ed
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This album is one of the best the Foo Fighters have released yet.  Hell, this album is one of the best albums to be released by any band in a while. The music is driving, the lyrics are great, it is wonderful.  I can't wait to see them live.<br /><br />Buy the album.  Love it.  Play it loud.
B003Y5H5JM|5.0|Shakespeare could not draw flies on a battlefield of rotting corps on a hot summer night in August. Crowds only go to Shakespeare's plays when they are free.     The storied Delacort Theater, Central Park, NYC, NY would be empty if there was an admission price to pay. This festival is populated by pompous asses who don't have a dime, putting on airs of expertise regarding the legend, William Shakespeare.    Wanted to see The Tempest but figured it will be out on DVD in a month, so why spend the money on a flick that has no subtitles-right? That is why I skipped it even though the arty/farty theater/cinema that was showing The Tempest was in walking distance from my apartment on the trendy Upper West Side of Manhattan.    Consider myself the holder of the largest collection of William Shakespeare on audio cassette, DVD, VCD and CDs in the world, more than Amazon, more than the NY Public Library, more than the Folger Library and more than Oxford or Cambridge.    There is no interest in William Shakespeare whatsoever. That is why no mainstream theater will show his work.     I'l have to wait to see The Tempest on DVD in September. Damn.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|This is the second Bond film starring Daniel Craig.  As of now he is my favorite Bond.  His James Bond is the closest to the character written by Sir Ian Fleming.  Bond is supposed to be the cold eyed killer.  I know there are those out there that miss Q and the gadgets but I have enjoyed the last two Bond films much more than all the others.  I highly recommend it.
B000QCUB8I|4.0|Notice half the reviews here make the Daft Punk comparison. It's hard not to. The dance/pop/electronica sound will fill your room, and put a smile on your face. Reminds me a bit of Basement Jaxx also. When this album is on, you have to work at remaining still. The urge to move is hard to avoid. Even right now as I listen, both my feet and shoulders and neck are moving, and I'm sitting. Instant party? Yes.<br /><br />Funny what you find at a thrift store for 99 cents in small town Vermont.
0823016714|3.0|The images are too grainy to be more than just good reference for placing the elements of the face correctly.  The bad lighting in all the photos doesn't help either.  Lots of different faces and expressions to choose from though.
B002N1AEN2|3.0|was pretty happy with this album. Has a slow, chill, electronic and some times 80s like sound. One song sounds very much like Chris Isaak song...maybe a little too much. Either way both are awesome songs.Though I do think this album would be better if not for the lazy like voice style sound of the two lead singers. All in all, its still different and  worth buying for no more than $8 or to download.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|There are so many reviews that I will just say: READ ALL OF THE BOOKS IN THIS SERIES!!! They are well worth the time it takes to do so. I have read them all more than once and will continue to read them over and over.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|This is an awesome movie.  Don't even begin to listen to the critics.  Makes you want to go to Venice!!  Johnny Depp is funny and Angelina is amazingly gorgeous.

B004T0XYM8|5.0|So much has been written of Leone's last Western with Eastwood, \\"The Good, Bad and the Ugly\\" that one can overlook this masterpiece from him starring a top flight cast of Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale, Jason Robards and Charles Bronson in the role that was originally slated for Clint Eastwood--\\"Harmonica\\".  If you want a culmination of all the great directors who have mined this genre, like Ford, Mann and Hawks--you couldn't look no further than this classic.  Yet there's also a touch of the sardonic in Leone's direction that we don't get these great directors.  My only complaint is in the dubbing of some of the villains in this film.  In particular at the beginning of this film where Bronson meets the three hombres dispatched by Frank (Fonda), they are brilliantly played by 2 distinctly American character actors, Woody Strode and Jack Elam, plus an unknown european actor I'm unfamiliar with.  I'm very familiar with Elam's voice so it was disconcerning to me to find him dubbed--and it didn't match his physical demeanor.  One will never know why Leone did this since Jack's voice is sinister enough to convey menance.  Anyway, outside of Cardinale's dubbing which I can understand since she definitely has an Italian accent plus a semi-raspy voice, the leads are superb with the added attraction of Fonda's cold-blooded killer, one of the first times along with his role in \\"Firecreek\\", to play against image--and successfully to boot.  He's stated in interviews that this was one of his favorite roles, playing an outright S.O.B. with no saving graces--and I agree.  I hopefully expect that the scene between Cheyenne and the crippled CEO is restored in the Blu-ray version.
B00247RVGS|2.0|The DVD did not play properly in my player. I was able to watch the DVD but the disk made a loud annoying sound when it played.
0470876417|4.0|Excellent book, really easy to read and understand! However it leaves you with many questions and also it would have been nice to see more cases, more brought down to earth cases.  Really nice design! You can read the book in two days tops!
1591843790|4.0|What I liked about Enchantment was how incredibly practical it was.  I keep referring back to the chapter on Push Technology as I look to improve my Twitter use.  I have also kept going back to the chapter on How to Enchant Your Boss as I have a boss I often don't know how to please.    This is a book I see myself pulling out every so often just to review how I'm doing in various areas.      If you're looking for a book on how to be an influencer this is for you.
B004ZQGB9E|4.0|I am fan of Queen.  So are you.  But there is a time in a Queen fan's life that they must grow beyond the Greatest Hits albums.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I have not heard 80% of these tracks before.  That is nothing less than a total and complete travesty!  The albums are all varied, fascinating, and examples of what music can be when you take a talented band and amp the drama up to 11.  Surprise stand outs for me are \\"Great Rat King ~Queen\\", \\"Liar ~Queen\\", \\"White Queen ~Queen II\\", and \\"In the Lap of the Gods ~Sheer Heart Attack.\\"  Not to mention all of the classics that are included, which I won't list because you already know which ones I'm talking about. :)<br /><br />However, I am disappointed in how these tracks were presented as a single album with the same piece of album art.  It took me nearly an hour of work with an MP3 tag editor and Google images for these tracks to split into their correct albums with the original album art.  I shouldn't have had to do that.<br /><br />tl;dr - Music? Amazing and worth buying! Presentation of the tracks? Poor and frustrating.
B004QPOVF0|5.0|Hi, I've been an AC/DC fan since 1990. I've seen them almost 30 times only in this last Black Ice Tour. So I was waiting a lot this new release. Well... the concert is simply amazing. 32 HD cameras are working great together and the sound quality of this video is beyond belief. and the crowd? we'll simply the best crowd ever filmed on camera... have you ever seen an entire stadium jumpin' and rockin'?? Here you can!
B004OR1X6A|5.0|This was billed as the &#34;lost&#34; album before Photo Finish.  I really enjoyed this cd and if you're a Rory fan you'll love it.  The 2nd CD is live and as always is awesome.  I myself don't really see it as a lost album as a number of these songs ended up on Photo Finish (PF).  They seem more like transitions to me, or steps along the way, close to the finished product. What ended up on Photo Finish was superior IMO.  He dropped the keyboards and went back to a trio, which seemed to really make a difference upon comparison.  For some reason the keyboards seem to be in the way on these recordings, again, IMO.  For example, Brute Force and Ignorance has horns at the end and just doesn't measure up to PF.  It's good but not as good.  Fuel the the Fire's final product on PF is more powerful than this version.  Also, Overnight Bag is way different from PF but I prefer the mix from the Crest of a Wave Best of CD.  So, these songs are interesting to listen to but don't measure up to their finished product on Photo Finish, which is maybe why Rory canned them and moved on.
B000FC1MOQ|1.0|As a recovering addict who has been in 6 treatment centers in 3 different states, I have never seen or heard of the kind of treatment that is described in this book.   I am also personal friends with two who went to the clinic named in the book.  No one would ever treat addicts receiving treatment as he described.  It just isn't done.  Had he gone there himself he would know this.  I pray that the treatment described doesn't scare off those needing substance abuse treatment.      That being said, the book is a good read if you want to read pure fiction.  Just know that this is his made up rehab world.
B0029ZA3H4|4.0|Gary is a charming guy. He's also hardworking and smart. The book is a reflection of his personality and passion. Gary shows that if you're passionate and willing to \\"hustle\\" and at peace with your family you can go really far and succeed. Truly inspiring.     It's a short book and easy to swallow. There are some practical advice here and there but the biggest take away for me is more of a motivational one. You can do it. Just go for it!    My favorite quote: \\"Here's the deal: if you want it badly enough, the money is there, the success is there, and the fulfillment is there. All you have to do is take it. So quit whining, quit crying, quit with the excuses\\".
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Generally Amazon is on top of the curve, but they seem to have dropped the ball here.<br />I have the Kindle for PC app and wanted to install it on my T Mobile phone as well, but after many attempts I have not been able to install it.<br />I have tried using their QR code & going through the market with zero results. I finally found the page to put in my phone number & followed the steps. It actually downloaded to my phone, but it won't unpack & install. Such a pain.
0439023521|5.0|I can't say enough good about this book, this series of books.  I couldn't put them down!  I was on the edge of my seat through the entire series, and am really stressed about what to do now that I no longer have Katniss Everdeen in my life.  Might just read them again!  Already forced one friend to read them, plan to pass them along to a few others.  Really if you're looking for a fun, cliff-hanger-type read, this book is for you.  Hell, this book is for everyone.
B000YD7S2Q|2.0|It is my practice not to buy a DVD, CD or Blu-Ray until  I have read the reviews,  My fellow shoppers have demonstrated more artistic erudition than I claim to possess. Unless I really, really  know the artistes and their Organizations, I rely on the consensus created by my fellows to make my decision.  In this case I relied only on the fact that Werner Herzog was the guiding artistic force behind the production.  I was disappointed.  The entire production was static.  The staging sparse to empty; the \\"crowd scenes\\" devoid of people;, Lohenggin's Lieber Schwann, a mechanical joke.  About the only dramatic action was between Elsa and Ortrud in a name calling scene.  I've learned my lesson:  Pay heed to my fellow Amazonians.:  Read their reviews before I put money on the barrel head,  8 out of 10 times I'll agree with the majority call.  Hey! fellow reviewers, Aint we all so clever and discerning, that the poor plebians can rely upon our views? King Arthur, Arthur Stanley Katz, May 18, 2011
0439023513|5.0|The final installment of The Hunger Games, just really wraps it up well.  Might not be the ending you were hoping for, but man is it powerful.  Katniss is my hero.  If you've read the first two books, I don't know if it will be possible for you not to read this one, so just get ready for an emotional ride.  I just sobbed over this book, such a moving end to Katniss's story.  You'll love it too, I'm sure!
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie was adorable. My 10 yr old daughter loved it and the story is well written. The movie/DVD copy was in excellent condition. Enjoy for years to come.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|One of THE funniest films I have seen in years!!!  Truly classic!  Had to buy a copy...love it that much!!
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. Every track has a unique feel that will get you swaying back and forth.   Since I got the album I haven't stopped listening.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I'm assuming that people reading reviews of Catching Fire have already finished reading The Hunger Games, as there might be spoilers of the first book here.<br /><br />Catching Fire picks up where The Hunger Games left off. After winning The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are back in District 12, living the good life in the Victor's Village. The two of them are then quickly whisked off to complete their victory tour around all twelve districts. But it isn't all peace and happiness for our Hunger Game victors. It is in this second book that Collins starts the initial sparks of a rebellion and the idea starts to catch fire. The author quickly throws in jaw-dropping drama, drops plot twists, and does not let you put the book down.<br /><br />Catching Fire does not really end. It merely sets up a cliffhanger for the third book, Mockingjay. If you read Catching Fire, then you'll inevitably have to read Mockingjay. Really. You'll be dying to know what happens next when this book ends.<br /><br />After I finished reading The Hunger Games, I was indifferent about finishing the rest of the series. I only did so because I could borrow them for free from my friend on the Kindle. With that in mind, I would say that you could stop reading after the first book or you could read the entire series. Reading just the first two books is not an option.<br /><br />Overall, if you really enjoyed The Hunger Games, then go ahead and continue along in the series. It's tons of fun to read and very entertaining. On the other hand, if you don't care to continue the series, I don't think that you're really missing out by stopping after the first book. My main criticism of this series, not just this book alone, is that although the series is fun to read, it lacks depth. It is neither powerful nor profound, and it's certainly not going to change the way you view the world.
0375842381|5.0|These story emcompass and interesting take on the imagination, and should be share with friends and family. Children who loved the golden compass should surely love this trilogy set.. It is destined to be a classic
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I'm assuming that people reading reviews of Mockingjay have already finished reading The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, as there might be spoilers from the first two books here.<br /><br />Catching Fire abruptly ended with a cliffhanger, and Mockingjay quickly picks up the story. Catching Fire laid the initial sparks for a rebellion and in Mockingjay those sparks ignite a full-fledged attack against President Snow and the Capitol. Katniss Everdeen takes her place as the face of the rebellion.<br /><br />More than the other two books, Mockingjay struck me as being rather juvenile. While in the middle of reading some very fast-paced action sequence, I reached a part in which the author pitted bows and arrows against hovercrafts dropping bombs. Seriously? Bows and arrows are going to take down hovercrafts? Too overcome with disbelief, I had to put the book down for a little while. At last, I resumed reading when I reconciled the unbelievable action in the book by comparing it to a video game. Yes, all of the action in Mockingjay is just like a video game - there are special weapons, underground tunnels, booby traps, and sudden terrain shifts. When people die, it happens with so little fanfare that you hardly even realize it happened. In short, it is nothing like a real war. But imagining all of the action in Mockingjay as a video game helped me suspend my disbelief and I no longer had any issues with the lack of realism in the novel.<br /><br />Continuing from the first two books, Mockingjay remains very claustrophobic. Actually, it's even more claustrophobic than the first two books. I originally expected that a rebellion against an oppressive government would feel freeing. Unfortunately, not so in Mockingjay. The characters seem to exchange one oppressive government for another. I wonder if the author has such a depressing outlook of world governments.<br /><br />Overall, Mockingjay was a decent conclusion to the series. Just like the other two books, it is fast-paced, thrilling, and action-packed. There are twists and turns throughout the story, always when you least expect it. The climax of the novel falls very close to the end of the book, leaving very few words to draw the entire series to a proper end. Hence, the ending feels rushed, hurried, and abrupt. The author could've spent a little more time to tie up the loose ends. Of the three books, this one could've used a little more polish.<br /><br />My main criticism of this series, not just this book alone, is that although the series is fun to read, it lacks depth. It is neither powerful nor profound, and it's certainly not going to change the way you view the world.cked. There are twists and turns throughout the story, always when you least expect it.

1439102724|2.0|I'm not sure what Picoult was trying to do with this. Like all of her books, it was a fast read...that never really seems to be the problem. The problem, for me, is that I'm finished with the book and I have no idea what it was all about. And not just in a, the message was so big that I need a day to digest it, it's more like...What was the point? It seems like Picoult tried to shove every controversial item inside one book, and then told it horribly one sided. There was definite liberal agenda here, which didn't really bother me, as I consider myself a liberal, but what doesn't make any sense to me is....so what? All she accomplished in this book was bashing the religious right all in the name of trying to save the liberal left from getting bashed? There was no thought provoking issues from the right. They were just, \\"the bad guys.\\" I don't know, seems entirely too cut and dry with an ending that was entirely too predictable. If she wanted to talk about big issues like homosexuality, religion, new age medical techniques, you think she would have done it in a new way. There is nothing surprising here, other then the inability to get people to think.
B004Q7E0TA|2.0|As much as I love Ellen, I thought her wife would be equally talented. Not so much... It was very repetitive! A lot of \\"I'm this, what will people think, who am I, who will except me\\". I was annoyed very much with how she was so concerned with how people wouldn't be excepting of her and how she didn't know who she really was. I was slightly disappointed, I kept waiting for her to say how much she liked her herself after she found Ellen or how she was made whole by her relationship or something. I wouldn't recommend this book. If you like whining, BUY IT!
0156027321|5.0|This author made the most outlandish things in this book, seem entirely realistic. Had you told me this was an entirely true story after I had read it, I would believe it 100%. Incredible writing, but also light...lighter. A very feel good story.
B004SS0884|4.0|When I posted my first review of this album, Britney and I were not on the best terms. I'm unsure why, but this album just wasn't clicking for me. I wanted this to be like a Robyn or Ellie Goulding album, which I've realized is unfair. I was assessing Britney from a point of view that was contradictory to who she was and what kind of music she made. It was like rating a Country album by R&B standards.    So this is an update. 'Femme Fatale' is nearly the best album of Britney's career, a close-to-flawless follow-up to the good but not great 'Circus'. The entire album, including the bonus tracks, could be played straight through during a spin class, with the possible exception of two songs. Every song follows the template of ripping synths, pounding dubstep, or bouncing electro. This gives the album a cohesiveness without the songs sounding too similar, though it also quickly reveals which songs aren't quite as good as their companions.    None of the tracks are weak, per say. However, '(Drop Dead) Beautiful' with its weak lyrics suffers from being placed between two of the strongest songs on the album, and 'Trouble For Me' just doesn't pound and fill out speakers with quite the energy that 'Big Fat Bass' does. That being said, they're two songs that eclipse at least half of the material on 'Circus', so it's not like they're a failure.    Of the bonus tracks, 'He About to Lose Me' and 'Don't Keep Me Waiting' are immediate standouts. The former is a haunting confessional with the best lyric of the album: 'I'm touching hands with someone seriously beautiful.' The latter is a retro-rock (yes, rock) influenced song that recalls Britney's earlier days. The stuttering British-accented bridge helps as well. The other two are solid, but both are an obvious step down from the content on the regular edition.    Bottom line: Britney delivers the second-best album of her career. 'Blackout' still stands as the no-filler sleazy beast of an album that may never be topped, but it doesn't need to be. Not when Britney delivers such marvelous dance records like 'Femme Fatale'.    Letter Grade: A-    Recommended Tracks:    Singles 'Till The World Ends' and 'Hold It Against Me'  'Inside Out', the sexiest pop breakup song of the past decade  'How I Roll', which makes a brilliant beat out of breathing and popping sounds
0307341577|4.0|I love this author. From the opening sentence in this book she's able to grab you...mainly by being, pretty much creepy as hell. She writes with a realness to her characters that allow them to be dark, and fairly unlikeable, but in the end you go about rooting for them anyway, because they're the only person with you that's exploring the dark spaces that Flynn creates. She's able to write murder mysteries that don't absolutely reek of murder mysteries, which has to be somewhat of a pretty incredible talent. I would read anything by this author.
B001E45XT4|4.0|The Headset is amazing! I had no idea but you can use it for your mp3 player as well! So soft and confortable. the only problem is that it gets a little hot in the ear area but it is well worth it! 9/10!
0307454541|3.0|Ummmm. I'm thinking it most be the translation right? He couldn't really have been this masochisitc against women, or.......that bad of a writer. It had to be the translation. Sort of like...tomatoe / tomato. Except one tomatoe means extreme, completely unnecessary and long drawn out sex scenes with unwilling women and the other tomato means ......writing in a way that makes sense. I'm not bashing the entire series....but there were some GLARING issues with this book. So, I'll blame it on the translation, and maybe never go to Sweeden where everyone's name is apparently exactly the same. Oh, and...why did everyone want to bang Michael Blomkvist? And by that I mean....literally every female character that was in the book for longer then 5 seconds wanted him.
B001YXZL7E|4.0|The 1st part of Quentin Tarentino's epic two-part saga of revenge is quite good. i like all the tracks, especially \\"Battle Without Honour Or Humanity\\" & \\"The Lonely Shepherd.\\" WARNING: The track Queen Of The Crime Council has strong language.<br /><br />KILL BILL VOL. 2 REVIEW<br /><br />The 2nd part of Quentin Tarentino's epic two-part saga of revenge is not as good as the first. I like the tracks \\"A Few Words From The Bride,\\" \\"Il Tramonto,\\" \\"A Silhouette Of Doom,\\" \\"Truly And Utterly Bill\\" \\"Malaguena Salerosa\\" and \\"Urami Bushii.\\" My only complaint is that the track Black Mamba is inappropriate for this movie (and in general).
0060936223|2.0|Ummmmm. I just couldn't get into this one. It was slow. And not slow in the same way as Eat, Pray, Love, was slow but it was slow and sort of ....uninteresting. At least eat, pray, love was infuritating because it was just ludicrous, but this wasn't really ludicrous. It's not really...anything. Maybe I'm being too harsh, and maybe I shouldn't even have read the book if I didn't partiularly care about Patti Smith, or this era, but then again, I was disappointed not to be pleasantly surprised....
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Grohl is always talking about getting out of the shadow of his Nirvana days.  This album is one more piece of evidence -- what he has created on his own and with FF band-mates is more enduring, more versatile, and just better than the Nirvana stuff.  One of the best musicians of the last 20 years, without question.  Album does not disappoint.
031261246X|5.0|Mark does a great a job in this book of explaining what is happening as he goes along. He gives a chilling look in the possible future of computers and malware. Being a fan of Clancey and Crichton I find he writes in the style of these two authors. He gives a detailed description of events as they are unfolding. This book is a great read for anyone! I can't wait for the 2nd book if there is one!
B003LR4QPE|5.0|I don't think that I can add more of substance on this collection.  You either like or dislike modern instruments and you eith like or dislike Rilling's work.  For myself, I have been waiting an awefully long time to get this set at a reasonable price.  Having purchased the Brilliant complete set a couple of years ago, I really only wanted the sacred cantatas by Rilling and his forces.  I would gladly have paid $250 for these alone.  To receive the whole of Bach for the same price is a windfall indeed.<br /><br />My only comment of Rilling vs. more modern approaches is to moan the passage of time.  There was a time when Klemperer's recordings rested supreme among Bach sacred works.  Now he is considered sluggish and overblown.  But then, tastes change.<br /><br />A note on the packaging.  I am a little disappointed that Hassler falls short in the disc sleeves.  Where Brilliant provided studry heavy paper sleeves, color coded by type of music, and provided detailed recording information on teh back of each sleeve, Hassler is satisfied to provide thin, black paper sleeves with a clear front to view the disc (of course, Hassler also provides much more documentation elsewhere than does Brilliant).<br /><br />One recommendation:  given 172 discs and black sleeves with no information on them, I suggest you purchase a pack of white sleeves, also with clear fronts, so that you can replace sleeves, black for white, as you listen to the CDs.  Doing this offeres a visual record at a glace as to your progress throughout the set.
0060936223|4.0|This is  a must-read for all art lovers and art historians, as well as anyone who loves rock 'n roll.  Patti Smith is candid, chatty and a surprisingly good writer. It's the perfect book for anyone  interested in the NYC hip scene of the late 1960s and 1970s. A non-traditional love story.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|I take my place as the curmudgeon. As a lifelong Beatles fan (can't believe I have loved this band since I was 5 -40 years later) I think that this is not the masterpiece it is touted as. In terms of production and sound-it does qualify as groundbreaking. The songs just don't hold up as well as the songs on Rubber Souls or Revolver or Meet the Beatles. Harrison's Within without You is melodically good, but reeks of his pretensions and is the most dated track on the record. When I'm Sixty-four hardly qualifies as Rock n' Roll-but is a solid tune never-the less. Good Morning-while rockin' is not that great as a song except for snippets like \\"time for tea and meet the wife\\" -a brilliant throw away Lennonism. Fixing a Hole is a lovely  tune, but not great as the others- Lucy, Day in the life, Mr.kite which are undeniably brilliant.The theme song, while full of Beatle energy and a great sing-along is not among their best either. Sonically woven together the album stands well as a through-piece. Taking the songs apart individually, not all of them hold up as well. I should note that if I were Roger McGuinn or someone, I would think Fixing a Hole was among the apex of my songwriting career, but McGuinn was not the songwriter that the Beatles were. Still, I love this record and Gettin Better all of the time still counts as some of the best backup singing the group ever did as an arrangement. There is a vibe to record that is unique -it probably stems from acid and them being able to finally relax together and be creative before they fell apart as the end of the touring machine left them to their own devices. What would have happened to them if they had modern sound systems at their disposal? Things may have turned out very differently...All in all a great, but flawed record.
0061726826|5.0|Lauren Oliver has created something epic with the first book in her new trilogy Delirium. You know from the first page right through to the very last that you are reading something... special? Yes. Stunning? A thousand times over. Easily making this one of the single best books I've read. Oliver has taken words and made them submit to her in this now, beloved by many, dystopian story surrounding a society hell bent on curing... Love.<br /><br />Who would have thought that a book telling the story of a single girl - Lena - and her path to being cured of \\"Love\\" or in Oliver's world \\"amor deliria nervosa\\" would have had the effect that it did not only on me, but so many other readers. It's hard to imagine a world where love is medically cured at the age of 18, but Oliver's writing, characters and story make falling head first - your heart following soon after - into its pages inevitable.<br /><br />Lena is just a few months away from being cured and while she's questioning things because of her past, it's her present and what's ahead in her future that ultimately changes her. She knows being cured is what comes next and is what is expected when you turn 18 years old. Once cured you are married to your perfect match and go on to live a normal if not mundane life. Her struggles to accept things on either side... the cure vs. Alex are what nudge her on and into a decision that'll ultimately change the world for her and those around her forever.<br /><br />And then there's Alex. He's different and Lena knows it. She's not sure exactly why, but it's there. It was quick to see how they were drawn to each other. Some secrets about Alex come out and in many ways force Lena to see the world, love and her life through different eyes and in the end giving her many different options that were never there. Alex was the perfect blend of good guy. Their relationship was thrilling and sweet and full of many emotions that you're able to experience right along with the two.<br /><br />With the date of Lena's cure approaching fast the two are faced with some hard choices. It's a thrilling end and a heartbreaking last few pages to say the least. Oliver has taken such an emotion as love and turned it upside down, inside out and changed it from head to toe. How is that possible you ask? Well, you'll have to read Delirium to see for yourself.proaching fast the two are faced with some hard choices.

031261246X|3.0|Mark Russinovich is a superstar developer and first rate blogger and speaker, and so I was very much looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I came away disappointed. As many have pointed out, the topic is serious and is worth every bit of light that can be shed on it. At the same time, I have to agree with every negative review here: core message and technical competency aside, this book is quite weak. The characters are cliche and one-dimentional, with every interaction presented through the lens of sex. If you can make it through the first half of the book, the second half reads a bit better, but still, sadly, not worthy of a recommendation.
076781326X|2.0|The movie is great - a classic I grew up with, however, the one I purchased was missing the first half of the movie.  The CD was a copy and started with the intermission of the second half.  I sent back to the distributor - waisting more money with hopes that a new and complete movie will come back to me.  My son was so excited to see the movie so we were all dissapointed that it was a defective DVD.

My  childhood delight in reading and re-reading of Paddington's adventures wasn't dimmed by the decades since childhood.     I can't say enough about it - just a joy, as are the others in the Paddington series - some are better than others, but they're a collection you must own if you have children.

I grew up in the 80s and AC/DC was one my favorite bands along with Metallica, Motley Crue, etc.. AC/DC is still going strong in my opinion without all the B.S. many other bands have been through. This DVD was fun to watch, even the 3rd time around. Sure, the guys are getting a little older now, but make no mistake...they still have it...and plenty of it. Rock N Roll at it's best! Let There Be Rock!

B003ZSJ212|2.0|There's not much left to say about the contents of this edition. It is rather disaponting.  Lucas is definetly testing the fan's patience and endurance in buying editions of SW, always with tiny modifications compared to the previous editions of the movies. A touched up effect scene, maybe a \\"lengendary missing scene\\", and a lot of mambojambo.  All I expect from these new editions in Blu-ray is a spectacular transfer, breathtaking sound quality.  About the lack of documentaries, it is obvious to me that Luca$ is saving them for a future release of 3D versions of the movies.  Another thing is this ridiculous campy cover! What the hell is that?   So, I guess I'll stick to my DVD editions a little longer. Maybe I'll buy the Blu-rays when they are cheaper.  This box-set is not worth what they are charging us for it.
B003UESJH4|5.0|My family and I are pretty particular about what movies we watch (we very seldom watch movies rated R), so I was a little concered when I looked up the film online and saw that there were 12 F bombs. I decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad that I did. This film was exceptionally well done and both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush did an outstanding job.<br /><br />My husband has a speech impediment, and so I was interested to see how King George V would be portrayed. I was encouraged to see the filmaker's willingness to portray the difficulties of those who struggle with their speech. The story was told with grace and the cinematography was beautiful.<br /><br />As far as content goes, apart from two scenes where there are a string of curse words (including several F words), the rest of the film is remarkably clean. The curse words are not scattered throughout the film - and for once, they are actually essential for the story (the King does not stutter when he curses, so the speech therapist uses this as part of his therapy).<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film and it is definitely worthy of all of the Academy Award acclaim!

I used this caddy maybe to put in a drink or keys a handful of times, otherwise keeping the empty caddy attached to the handles of my Maclaren buggy.  After a couple of months the loops came off.  The materials it's made of seem fine, but they should have made the stitching stronger or used some other way to attach those loops.  I will try to sew them back on, but it's a disappointment.

The songs we selected for the play, made a dramatic impression on the crowd.  It is a great cd and I am very glad that I purchased it.  Wish that I could buy one for everyone.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|George Lucas has legal right to change his films after he makes them, but altering the original work we all fell in love with is lame. Especially when multiple versions are available on the majority of Blu-Ray discs out these days. Why not include the cleaned up ORIGINAL version as well as his new corny additions? sounds simple to me.    The people have spoken, and Lucas' failure to address this major issue not only tarnishes his already flimsy reputation, but reassures me that he simply doesn't care. All more the negative.    I'll wait a year before biting the bullet, but I hope I won't have to eat my words.    NY, NY
0736092269|5.0|This book is obviously written with the athlete in mind, but artists will find it filled with a many detailed illustrations of the human body, and its muscles and skeleton, in relation to the body in motion.<br /><br />Often artist's anatomy and life drawing reference books show images in static positions directly from the side, front, side and back.  But the illustrations by author Delavier give many unique viewpoints and angles, ie:  the muscles under the arms as the arms are raised above the head, the muscles across the back and shoulder blade as the arms are in motion, and the shoulders from above etc.  In addition these illustrations show bones and muscle groups in working relationships to each other, ie: flexed/un-flexed, and/or turned and rotated etc.<br /><br />This book won't replace all your other art anatomy books but would be a great addition to any collection for the serious figure artist.  Its small size makes it easy to take with you for easy reference when sketching...but this also means that you may want to have a magnifying glass handy as well.  : )
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />At first the video quality was disappointing.  In the beginning, there were a couple of dark scenes where the video was distorted.  Throughout the movie, I was more pleased with the video, and am satisfied with this Blu-Ray purchase.  The video wasn't great, but it was pretty good.  I give it a 7.5 to 8.0 on a 10 point scale.<br /><br />The audio began in Dolby Digital 5.1, instead of Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  I had to open the menu to change it, and that wasn't easy.  I didn't know how I did it at the time, but I managed to change it to TrueHD, but I accidently turned on the English sub-titles.  I then figured out the system for changing the audio and sub-titles.  The letters were blue, with your selection being a slightly lighter shade of blue.  This is hardly noticable.  The selected audio and sub-title could have been red, or some other color to make it easier.
B003F76HFC|2.0|This book started out with an interesting enough plot.  Unfortunately, the main character needed to be more developed in order to be appealing (her main characteristic seems to be that she is really nice and sweet). The characters in the book have deep rooted problems and in the end everything wraps up WAY too neatly.  I bought this book to read at the beach knowing it would be a lighter read but unfortunately I was still disappointed by the way it ended.
0307595862|5.0|Have you ever received an electric shock from the mere act of picking up a book? I have. It happened with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN by Cormac McCarthy, and now again with THE SNOWMAN, Jo Nesbø's latest novel released in the United States. It's supercharged from beginning to end.<br /><br />THE SNOWMAN is part of the Harry Hole series, which is being published in the U.S. maddeningly out of order and incomplete to boot. Still, whether you are familiar with Hole or not, you will be mesmerized by this novel. Hole is an Oslo police investigator with a host of issues that make him by turns insufferable to work with and indispensable to an investigation. Possessed with an encyclopedic range of knowledge --- like a Swiss army knife, most of it useless until you need it --- and an uncanny intelligence, Hole is anything but a team player: abrupt, lacking tact, driven. If he is a player on any team, it is one that romps through his head, cackling and screaming and pulling him down. And in THE SNOWMAN, Hole is faced with and taunted by an adversary who threatens to suck him in and pull him down into madness.<br /><br />This is a beautifully rendered work that defies a quick and easy summary, simply because to reveal one thread of the plot can lead all too easily to the revelation of another, and from there yet another, until the whole of it is divulged. So I'll try not to give away too much while attempting to reel you in. The majority of the book takes place in Oslo in November --- one would be hard-pressed to imagine a bleaker place and time of year, at least as described by Nesbø --- and is kicked off by the disappearance of a wife and mother from her home in the dead of night during the season's first snowfall. The only trace left of her is a scarf wrapped around the neck of a newly completed snowman in her yard.<br /><br />Hole is brought into the case, one for which it appears he has received prior notice. Some weeks before the woman went missing, Hole received an anonymous letter that vaguely alluded to this occurrence in advance. The disappearance is followed by a particularly gruesome murder that appears to be related. As Hole delves more deeply into the investigation, relentlessly he begins to suspect that the current cases he's investigating are tied to a series of unsolved incidents going back several years, where women throughout Norway have vanished, without a trace, all of them during the winter season's first snowfall.<br /><br />Hole does not lack for suspects. And let me tell you, as interesting a dark hero as he may be, the villains here, even the innocent ones, are as unforgettable as any you will encounter in literature this year. There is one about whom I could go on forever. Read the book and figure out which one. And see if you can determine who the Snowman really is. Nesbø drops clues, actually playing fair. You can solve the murders. You really can. I had the fiend's identity guessed early on, but by the time I was halfway through, I was sure I was wrong. Along the way you will learn about genetics and rare diseases, and how swinging and depressing a place Norway really is; by the end, you will feel wrung out. I suggest that after finishing the book, you take a day or two and not read anything else, just to cleanse your mental palate. Nothing else will seem quite as good.<br /><br />So how good is THE SNOWMAN? It is so good that you will immediately obtain all of Nesbø's other adult works (he writes children's stories as well) and read them in one long sitting. Unfortunately, not all of his books, whether in the Hole series or otherwise, have been translated. Which brings me to an important word or 10: Kudos to Don Bartlett for a fabulous translation of the novel. Translators of foreign work are often ignored or, at best, given short shrift. That won't happen here. I am in awe of individuals who can translate literary works from any particular language you can name into English (I can't even translate my own handwriting), and Bartlett does a masterful job of capturing not only the letter but the spirit of Nesbø's work. However much he was paid for this was not enough; whatever praise he might gather is less than he deserves.<br /><br />As for Jo Nesbø, he will need to brush the snow off the mantle to make room for the trophies he will be acquiring.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaubful job of capturing not only the letter but the spirit of Nesbø's work.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|I resisted buying this book at first, but am so grateful that I did! This story takes place during the Nazi occupation of a small island off the coast of England called Guernsey Island.  The author does an excellent job of describing the island, the characters and their story. I felt as if I were there and knew these people.  I loved the characters, and cried over their pain and sorrows, and rejoiced over their victories.  There are many characters, and they are all so interesting and colorful!<br /><br />The story is set in both London and Guernsey Island, and follows Juliet, an author,  as she begins corresponding with the inhabitants of the island shortly after the end of World War 2.  Juliet learns of the Nazi occupation of the island, the resounding spirit of the people who live there, and the secrets and personal stories held within the hearts and souls of the survivors. As she writes to them and reads their letters to her, she becomes engrossed with the stories of the people who survived this hard time with an amazing grace and dignity. She falls in love with them and dedicates herself to writing a book a book based on their experiences. In order to gather more information, Juliet moves to the island and soon finds herself immsersed in the culture and relationships.<br /><br />This book is very creatively written in the form of letters. If the reader struggles at first getting it all sorted...hold tight and keep reading, because it is so worth the effort!!
0385341008|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the letter format of this book.  I was hesitant at first but it became an intimate look into the thoughts of the characters and their development.  A wonderful read.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah's Key is one of the saddest books I've ever read. It was well written and very thought provoking. It caused me to look up this historical event and research it myself.  There were some akward moments, but those were quickly overcome by the intensity and fast pace of the story.  This book starts off quick and intense and keeps the momentum with very little drag.      I would not recommend this book to those who want a 'warm fuzzy' story, because this book is not. However, it is sincere, heartfelt, and well written.  It is a book about a difficult subject without being nasty or vile.
0060555661|5.0|I wish I had read this book prior to investing any money on any stock market. It remains a seminal text for any individual investor and exposes the City of London and Wall street for what they are. Though not exactly contemporary it will provide a solid backbone from which to base future judgement.     If you want to buy only one book before investing - make it this one.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Our family read this book together as part of their school curriculum, and loved it.  This story is a great adventure for children and adults. It is beautifully illustrated. It tells the story of 4 children who are sent to live with an eccentric relative during the bombings of London during World War 2.  They are exploring their new environment when they happen into a new and strange land, Narnia, through the back of a wardrobe, and the adventure begins.     What an exciting adventure it is! It describes sweeping landscapes so vivid that you can easily imagine yourself climbing the crest of a mountain to see the beautiful valley before you! There are amazing creatures unlike anything you've ever seen before.     This book held the intrest of the children and was very fun to read to them.  They identified with these characters, and by the end of the book felt as if they were great friends.  C.S. Lewis is an amazing author, and this story is as relevant today as the day he wrote it.      Highly recommended!
B004G600A4|5.0|Bought this for my mother of all people for her birthday and of course she loved it!  I always get my orders shipped quickly and arrive almost exactly when they say it will.  Thanks Amazon!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I liked this book because it is written in a different format than most books.  The narration is captivating.  The author uses all your senses to help you experience this profound story.  The characters are believable and very well developed.  I loved this book, eventhough the story was of a very dark and sad time in our history.  The author did an excellent way of telling this story in a way that kept me reading into the night.      The unusual thing about this book that sets it apart from others, is the point of view the author chose to use.  Another great aspect is that one of the side characters, Papa, turns out to be quite a hero.  Thanks for not making him a villian. It was a wonderful touch to make the man be the tender and compassionate parent. I think this is a brilliantly written book. It is marketed to young adults, but certainly is very well written for anyone.  I have recommended this book to several other family members.
B004N44SOI|2.0|I loved the first Sixx AM album, it blew me away.  The new album not so much.  Starts off good, first couple of tracks are hot but it quickly grows cold with tacky lyrics and songs that sound like something I have heard before.      Nothing worse than when you hear a song for the first time and you can finish the artist's lines in the song because they have no creativity to them.  \\"Cut with a knife\\", \\"Angel like you with Devil like Me\\"... etc.  It's been done before Nikki.    DJ Ashba, amazing.  His playing saves this album.  Can't wait to hear him on a GnR studio album.
B004SEUIW4|5.0|Seems like the reviews that have proceeded me really don't need any added content.  They all got it right. A great story with REAL characters with no contrived plot twists. In fact, a lot of it I lived growing up around the timeframe of this movie. I mean, it all felt so real to me. The times, the characters, etc. Reminded a lot of my high school friends.  Eisenberg was great and Kristen Stewart was so believable and I found myself longing for my youth.    I was disappointed to go order the soundtrack (something I rarely do ) only to find it is not available. Such a drag.  The soundtrack is indeed an added character to the movie and took it to a whole different level.    I LOVED this movie and it's soundtrack.

B000JIHP88|3.0|I was so excited to get this for my 2 month old! I got it and put it all together and got it running and then noticed that one of the leaves kept getting stuck! so i tried adjusting it a little bit, thinking I did something wrong. Well I have had for over a month now and it still sticks and wont go up down like the other ones do unless u push it down then it will work for a brief second then quit! VERY irritating especially when u pay over $50 bucks!!!!! My baby doesnt know that all the leaves are suppose to drop and raise at the same time, all he knows is tht he likes it. It is nice because u dont have to wind it up every couple of minutes! All in all it is nice and my most important my son likes it! I should of sent it back but I guess i didnt want to take the time
B0015DWJX2|3.0|I have read this book so many times- both in Hebrew and in English-, and loved it so much.<br />The atmosphere and the characters are so well written, as well as the storyline.<br />The book is simply impossible to be put down.<br /><br />Only now- I am reeding the kindle version and i must sadly state that i'm not at all happy with it.<br />There are blunt typos as well as links to different letters that don't belong where they are.<br />The typing of the kindle version is obviously very unprofessional and the spelling is unchecked.<br />Do better next time.
0307595862|4.0|Some reviewers say Jo Nesbo is the best current Nordic crime writer. Some say he's the successor to Henning Mankell (who sadly has written his last Wallander book).<br />Nesbo is a rare combination of great storyteller and great writer. His stories are complex and absorbing. His writing sometimes makes you want to go back and look at a sentence again. Harry says \\"Evil is not a thing. It cannot take possession of you. It's the opposite; it's a void, an absence of goodness.\\"<br />Harry Hole, the main character, reminds me more of Michael Connelly's creation, Harry Bosch, than Kurt Wallander. He's an intelligent and intuitive detective who doggedly pursues the bad guys while sacrificing his own person life to the chase - all very much like Bosch.<br />Nesbo's Harry has regrets. He's still getting over a failed relationship and it doesn't help that Rakel, his former love, keeps showing up jumping into bed with him. You can feel his pain. He knows exactly what will happen if he lets her in the door -- the joy will be brief and bittersweet. She wants him, but she needs more stability for herself and her son.<br />In the meantime, women are being grotesquely murdered and it starts getting personal when the killer seems to be toying with Harry, finally threatening people he cares about. The plot is complex with quite a few twists and turns. Several story threads eventually come together but before they do, they complicate the investigation.<br />This is the first of Nesbo's books I've read. I'm looking forward to catching up with the ones I've missed.

B004LZRRRE|1.0|Beware of this release. The NTSC DVD's are defective. I went through two of them, that would not play in 4 different players. They skip, freeze, and pixelate like crazy. It is especially bad switching from the first to second layer. Also, all NTSC DVD's are missing the documentary and photo gallery. Until Universal addresses these problems, avoid this product. Too bad, because the CD's sound great, well mixed and not too loud and compressed like many modern releases.
B003Y74AXO|5.0|I've owned some devices in the past that ended up getting a mysterious scratch, so I've always been partial to picking up screen protectors especially while moving on to more expensive gadgetry (like, say, an iPad!).    I had this on my iPad for about half a year until I sold the iPad itself.  It worked great and when I pulled it off the iPad looked brand new, which helped me with the resell value.    I don't think the glare was any worst with this on, but it didn't get any better.  Fingerprint management did seem a little better with this on than without, and the cleaning cloth it came with is really nice for cleaning up the screen on occasion.    Bottom line is that it protected my iPad just fine and I would buy it again.
B004KPLVV8|4.0|The last time I saw Tron was in the theatre, and this is a timeless classic. When you look how far computers have come the original is still great.Tecnology has changed but I belive both young and the 50 something generation can both enjoy this together.
B004518W9G|1.0|The idea of having your car sound like a V12 Ferrari sound like a like a lot of fun. The SoundRacer and it's presentation of videos make you think it will be great. But with such an incomplete list of cars it works for it is really hit and miss and mostly miss. They did not have the Nissan Altima 2003 2.5 listed as a car that was not compatible so I ordered it. It didn't track my engines RPM through the cigarette lighter accurate at all. What was even worse was the sound quality through the speakers when it did rev unexpectedly. The Altima's a have a great sound system but this was just thin and noisy. It didn't even sound as good as what you hear on the internet.     I also tried this on an Isuzu Trooper 2000 with no results either of having it work properly. Maybe someone finds this product to be worthwhile but I don't know how. It would be better if you just made the engine sounds yourself like you were a kid shifting gears.    I would stay away from trying this.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I love ghostbusters 1-2... fun movie for the whole family to watch and it keep you laughing. I don't think there's a person alive who haven't seen these movies.  If there is; somebody should introduce them to it. Because it's well worth watching and buying. That's why when I saw that Amazon.com had it for sell on DVD, I brought it immediatedly from the seller goHastings for cheap. Oh yeah, goHastings ROCKS! :)
B000784WMW|4.0|I really did enjoy this rendition. So far I have seen a few of these. Being a series covering hours allows for a more complete telling than happens with a movie length production that has to omit and then alter situations to make sense.
1439190275|5.0|A very good read. Wonder why doctors don't use this book. All your doing is cutting sugar snd refined carbs out of your diet.
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|I found this to be an interesting idea about our evolution. No, I didn't read the book; so I can't compare it. I have read and viewed many different and similar theories. So far, I haven't drawn any conclusive perceptions on how the future will develop. Over all, I enjoyed the film.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I actually saw this movie long before I finally saw the complete season of \\"Firefly\\", and the second time watching it means that it made so much more sense to me!  I love the story and the universe Joss Whedon created; that being said, \\"Serenity\\" can be seen as a stand-alone movie (though I recommend starting with \\"Firefly\\").  All of the characters are really strong, there's a perfect balance of the serious with the humorous, and one thing I absolutely love is that the special effects are there to support the story and not put in as a tribute to themselves.  \\"Serenity\\" is a truly balanced movie; it's a space opera with Western themes; it's a comedy about a bunch of different people all traveling on the same starship; it's worth watching over and over again.  I would love Joss Whedon to make another movie or to make a new season featuring the \\"Firefly\\" cast; in a way, though, what he and the rest of the crew (including the actors) have accomplished is amazing and stands well on its own.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I have been a huge fan of this show since it first aired!! Absolutely love Chuck!! It's so witty, quirky, smart, action-packed and funny! The cast are the perfect choice and they just do an amazing job.  And it just gets better and better every season! This season is amazing, but season 4 just goes even further and after seeing the season finale to season 4-I CAN'T WAIT for season 5!!!  Seriously, if you're not watching this show, you're missing out!!  Love it!
B003UD7JEE|5.0|For a perspective, I rate 24, Dexter, the Shield, and the Sopranos as 5 stars and Alias, White Collar, and Burn Notice as 4 to 4.5 stars. All of them are television-series entertainment of the highest caliber. The new version of Nikita, that I am reviewing here, is absolutely 5 stars. As good as the episodes are, when you get to the last few episodes of the first season, you then have revealed to you how so many things that you previously saw were woven together in incredible plots by multiple people or groups in their own directions or interests. The only problem with this action packed, fun, well acted series is that you should not watch it until you can buy the whole season. Otherwise, you will be left aching to want to see what happens next.

1400052181|5.0|I am only about halfway through this book but it is a page turner.  Great flow, the author's style of writing makes you want to know more.  Hard to put down.  It's both a story and history, rolled together.
1400067936|5.0|I read this book after a friend of mine suggested it. I've not been the same person since reading it nearly 2 years ago. Much of life starts making sense to you. You learn to spot bad science, discount the advice of \\"experts\\", distinguish between \\"know-how\\"(mostly useful) and \\"know-what\\" (mostly useless). Even your approach towards health and fitness change. Most of all, the book gives you a framework to help you evaluate various life situations.     I've personally bought several copies of this book and presented it to many of my friends. Strangely, some of them did not like the book and could not get through it. So I guess you need to be in a particular frame of mind to actually accept the ideas presented in the book.
B0001HAISG|4.0|I bought this movie for four of my grandchildren.  My husband and I took them to see a live production and wanted to give them another version, and not the Disney version.  I had never seen this movie, but it's a wonderful production, so true to the original story and so beautifully realized.  I would recommend it highly for children four to really old like grandparents!
0439023521|5.0|I read The Hunger Games when a student (I teach high school) recommended it to me. The Hunger Games is a sci-fi Utopian society book which is right up my science-nerd alley. It is also a very captivating and intriguing book. I could not put the first one down and read it in less than 24 hours over spring break (not a huge accomplishment since it's written for teens and there are like 100 words per page). I already finished the second one and am currently half way through the third one. As the story goes on it has become much more intense and is kind of a dark political commentary.    The setting of the book is what I would call a post-apocalyptic United States, that is composed of 13 districts and a capitol. The capitol controls everything, and the districts are at their mercy. Some years ago, the 13th district rebelled against the capitol and as a result was obliterated. As a warning to the remaining districts, the capitol holds an annual \\"Hunger Games\\" in which 2 children from each district participate in a televised fight to the death in a control but nature-like setting (imagine Survivor, but the operators can control the conditions and in order to win you have to kill everyone else). Needless to say it is gruesome, but so suspenseful!    I'm liking the 3rd book (Mockingjay, second book is Catching Fire) less than the first two but can't really say why at this point. I also don't want to give anything away. I'll update again when I finish, but as of now I would say you should definitely read these books! My 50 something year old mom and 18 year old brother are reading them and loving them too. There is quite a bit of blood are gore, so if you're sensitive about that kind of this this might not be your cup of tea.

1400052181|3.0|Loved learning about the science and about Henrietta herself.  But for me, all the detail about the family's trials and tribulations was a bit uninteresting.  I get the premise, but found myself skipping over the stories of her relatives' lives in favor of the compelling science.  Their lives just were not that interesting to merit all that detail.

B0042RUMH8|1.0|just as Jennifer Lopez aka J  LO  was settling in on as a judge on American Idol after the fact she peaked musically if you will a decade ago, she puts this out  which is very  \\"Pitchy\\" bland, boring and somebody need to tell her after she stopped working with the Irv Gtti camp,etc..  it was a wrap. funny enough that a non singer can be judging singers.but then to drop another wack album is a bit much. musically she ain't counted nearly a decade.she did her best stuff when Puffy,Rodney Jerkins and especially when Irv Gotti had her on tracks, but since then, ain't hardly nobody feeling her joints.<br /><br />Rhianna and others have passed her by. just not happening any more. doing a track with Lil Wayne might have worked anywhere from 01-05, but she has lost whatever she had.
B002KKCVT6|5.0|I needed a new pair of sandals, as spring is upon us and summer is fast approaching.  After doing a little research and reading reviews, I decided that Teva would make a good brand to go for.  The price was pretty fair, so I made the purchase.  The sandal itself fits me perfect at size 10 and is very comfortable to wear and walk on.  It is basically a no-frills sandal, but looks to be made of high quality.  It also has good traction to boot, and has a nice cushioned feel throughout, but mostly in the heel area where you apply most of your walking pressure.  All in all, I am very happy with this sandal and would buy again when the need arises.
B001C4AFOY|1.0|I loved the Victoria Hamilton TV version (\\"Victoria and Albert\\") despite its flaws and faults.     \\"The Young Victoria\\" seemed so lifeless in comparison - so much depended on the viewer interpreting those very long pauses, glances, \\"deep\\" moments and emotions behind impassive faces.      If they continue with these actors, I do hope they learn to loosen up and bring some kind of warmth to the roles.      Check out \\"Victoria and Albert\\" for a different interpretation of these larger than life historical characters including the Duke of Wellington.      If you are in England - please visit Walmer Castle where he died. Walmer and Deal offer lovely seaside excursions.

0446530573|5.0|My Mom gave us The Sopranos Family Cookbook for Christmas because she knew we were fans of the HBO series.  For me, this cookbook was a case of love at first sight. First of all, who among us Soprano-philes could resist the cover?  The familiar and beloved faces of Tony, Sylvio, Paulie, Furio, Christopher and the crew sitting around a kitchen table enjoying a home-cooked Italian dinner together under the big red \\"Sopranos\\" logo. Just flipping through the book, I was immediately drawn in by the beautiful color photos of the finished recipes, more photos of the Sopranos characters in various scenes taken from the show, which are then cleverly tied in with the recipes featured.  Interspersed with the excellent classic Italian recipes, there is an absolutely charming, entertaining, humorous and very useful assortment of cooking tips, tricks and anecdotes attributed to our cherished Soprano friends and familia.  Artie Bucco, Carmella Soprano, Dr. Melfi, Uncle Junior, Bobby Bacala and more, introduce and editorialize chapters.  This cookbook is like none other.  It's fun!  It's not only extremely useful (my copy has many dog-earred and bookmarked pages), it is a must have for any Sopranos-loving, Italian food eating home cook. I highly recommend! ENJOY!
B004H4XL7E|4.0|Interesting concepts of social interaction as brain-information-processing. The proposed approach clearly defies every tipical sales-oriented-technique. Putting rapport and similar methods aside, this book will challenge you to pitch in a non-technical arena, seeking hot cognitions and discovery channel based frames. Pretty cool.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I enjoyed playing this puzzle game in the vein of Myst. Like others have mentioned, it's rather short but it kept me entertained so would say it's worth it, be it free or at 99 cents.     Depending on your device's touchscreen sensitivity, controls can get a little frustrating on the final puzzle and one where there's a number slider selector. In my case the slider or wheel would move just a bit when I would let go but after some repetition, managed to compensate.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I love the books, and this is one movie that comes close to capturing the true essence of the books.  You won't be disappointed.
B004DMIIVO|2.0|The Good     1.) The film's central message is decidedly pro-FAMILY. In short, as the world goes into crisis mode, it's not the state that will be coming to save you (if you're lucky), but rather your family. And who lies at the heart of the family? The mothers and grandmothers, of course!     2.) VISUALS: Who needs Tron when you have animation like this? The animated scenes depicting the action in the digital world of OZ are really something, if not a bit confusing at times.    3.) The story's concern with the vulnerability inherent in putting so much information online makes for an intriguing commentary on our own society. Anything that CAN go wrong with the internet DOES go wrong in 'Summer Wars,' from identity theft to digital warfare to the evolution of a \\"SKYNET\\"-like Artificial Intelligence bent on disrupting society in general. Could it happen in reality? You'll be left to wonder.      The Bad/Not-so-good:    1.) The plot jumps around quite a bit. This isn't such a bad thing considering the size of the cast and the sheer likability of the MANY characters, but the story simply loses focus. With all the time spent on the various family members and everything we learn about them, more time should have been spent with the \\"main\\" character prior to his exposure to this family unit. Even a brief glimpse at the boy's own home life would have benefited the plot immensely.    2.) Sorta rips off the 'Digimon' movie. Check it out if you don't believe me.    3.) Who would release an evil Artificial Intelligence creation on the world, starting in Japan? How about China, with its well-known animosity towards and rivalry with the Japanese, both as an economy and a nation in general? Or a group of multinational cyber-terrorists, or even digitally-based anarchists? Nope, nope, and nope.     *SPOILER ALERT*     The culprit is none other than America. This was a total cop-out.     I mean, let me get this straight: The US Military buys the program for an Artificial Intelligencewith the full knowledge that it is designed to destabilize digital programs over the web, AGGRESSIVELY and EFFICIENTLY. So, where do they run their first test? A controlled environment, where the AI can do no serious harm? Nope! They test it on OZ, an entity that is of the utmost importance in everything from social networking to portable heart monitors. What would the US, or ANY nation for that matter, have to gain from creating the potential for such chaos??    You can call it a metaphor, or a commentary on US foreign policy, or whatever you want.     I call it shoddy storytelling, and it really hurt the overall experience.      BOTTOM LINE:     This was a pretty good story, but not a great story. Great stories grab your attention without offending your intelligence.     If you want to see a great story, check out 'Spirited Away', or any Pixar film.     And do give 'Summer Wars' a chance. For what it's worth, it's still pretty entertaining.

B0037BB00I|4.0|After enjoying her second album, 21, so much, I purchased 19...there's a world of difference! The younger Adele has the same gutsy, honest appeal, but without quite as much polish. She seems to still be finding her range and style on 19, but the groundwork for her style has been set: the bluesy, heartfelt lyrics are accompanied by piano and guitar among other instruments, and her voice seems to not have been digitally manipulated during postproduction, a definite change from other young singers who are currently enjoying popularity.

This one tugged on my heartstrings like I was a yo-yo, yo!<br /><br />My only beef is the scene where Harvey Dent tells the Mexican boy -- who didn't do anything but cry and whine throughout the film -- that he was the bravest Marine he'd ever met seemed a bit overblown. I suppose the jarhead league needs more Hispanic recruits lately or something.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I was little skeptical before I start reading this book.There are so many books about memory development. But this book is like no other. It is totally different approach and I loved this book. It is like a mystery book which you can not keep down.No doubt book gives us some ideas like memory palaces, etc but overall I like the book for its approach towards memory in general.What we are missing in current explosion of google,facebbok and twitter and internet explosion. Worth read!
B000JQUZCI|3.0|I'd never read Frankenstein before, and I enjoyed it. The language is a bit obtuse, which sometimes was charming and sometimes annoying. The pace seemed a bit uneven to my modern sensibilities, with some sections waxing lyrical about things philosophical and other sections led by action. On balance, though, Shelley put in quite a lot more philosophy than action.<br /><br />I read the free Public Domain Kindle edition, and the layout left a lot to be desired. The sad thing is, there are literally dozens of editions of this book on Amazon, and most of them are IDENTICAL to the Public Domain one. Don't waste your money! Check the samples before you buy, or just overlook the flaws of the free edition and enjoy the book.

B002GYI9C4|5.0|Magic in a fantasy novel can be a tricky thing. Some writers are too nebulous with their magic, making its parameters unclear, and leaving the door open for deus ex \\"magica.\\" Some are too specific, with long passages of too-detailed explanation that don't really help the story. The magic in Sanderson's Mistborn really adds a dimension to the story, the characters and especially the action. His systems of Allomancy and Ferruchemy are like a physical presence in the book, permeating the characters that use them, adding an exciting sensual element to the action sequences that you can almost feel as you read. Their powers and limitations are easy to follow, and they are crucial to the plot without dominating it.<br /><br />The story is a kind of coming of age tale wrapped in a political rebellion and stuffed with mystic, religious elements. A teenaged girl thief catches the attention of a veteran leader of lowborn ruffians who has a plan to overthrow the government and destroy its leader, the immortal Lord Ruler, who claims to be God or at least a \\"Sliver of the Infinite.\\" The enigmatic leader Kelsier (\\"there is always another secret\\") is part skaa, the class of people who have been enslaved for so many generations they have forgotten freedom, and part nobleman, the corrupt and cruel high society that in turn serves the Lord Ruler. He is also Mistborn, a rare breed able to use all forms of Allomancy. The story follows the girl Vin as she learns about the world and about her abilities, and Kelsier as he takes on the impossible task of raising an army from a population of slaves. The cultural and personal elements are strong even without magic, and the magic makes them stronger. Vin has survived some of the worst conditions this world can offer, and she must come out of her shell and join the rest of the world, while at the same time mastering her magical abilities. Kelsier lives and breathes Allomancy, and is one of the strongest Mistborn, but most of his travails are political and personal, where his magic can't help him.<br /><br />The magic really shines in the action sequences, as Mistborn leap around the city at night, propelled by their magic, fighting each other with surges of magically enhanced strength, pushing and pulling metal with their minds, and twisting the emotions of their foes as they fight using glass daggers and wooden staves. If these sound something like Jedi powers, well, they are sort of similar, but Allomancy is more specific and limited, has strict rules and doesn't rely on a mysterious pervasive \\"force.\\" Sanderson beautifully interleaves the specific abilities with combat, travel, and more subtly in personal interactions between those with the abilities and those without.<br /><br />Mistborn needs no dwarves, elves or fairies. There's no room for them. The Lord Ruler's realm has plenty of cultural and political variety without leaning on the trappings of classic fantasy. Eerie creatures roam the mists, but Sanderson gets by just fine without dragons or goblins or anything of the sort. The Final Empire is an original world, setting and story with memorable characters and a unique magic all its own.and personal, where his magic can't help him.

1439107955|5.0|In addition to telling the many riveting stories of those who have persevered in trying to identify the causes and cures of the many kinds of cancer that are inevitable (we now know) given our genetic nature, Mukherjee provides us with insight after insight into how scientists think. It is messy at times, wrong often enough, but in the end it is a delightful thing to see unfolding before your eyes. On the other side, reading about the desperate desire for a cure that leads many patients and their allies to condemn testing and validating treatments before they are put into general use is a reminder that emotions, not thinking, is what drives most of us to believe and behave the way we do most of the time.

B003QP4NPE|5.0|What if a rogue AI, a distributed process running on tens of thousands of computers all over the internet, could recruit boots on the ground from among \\"the disaffected, the dispossessed, the displaced, the disgruntled. Worldwide\\"? What if it created an organization as distributed as itself, with no centralized power structure, with individuals having knowledge of only their local comrades, with no individual knowing the whole big picture? What if it had effectively unlimited financial resources and was able to have its minions manufacture various deadly remote controlled avatars for it (and them) to use? How would corporations and governments stop such an entity? Could they?<br /><br />These are some of the questions posed in Daemon, probably the most amazing first novel I've ever read. Suarez gets everything right. His mind-bending worldwide plot is remarkably plausible, even with 2004 (the year the book was written) technology. His characters are as authentic as the varied settings where the action plays out, and the action - it never stops. His writing chops aren't the only thing that is so impressive. Suarez has big ideas, too: fascinating takes on globalization, government bureaucracy, legal, correctional and criminal organizations. There's even a dose of philosophy and moral calculus, but nothing heavy handed. His background as an independent systems consultant lends a frighteningly realistic edge to the deadly effective technologies employed by the ruthlessly efficient Daemon.<br /><br />The coolest thing about this book for gamers is that the whole system was designed by the head of CyberStorm Entertainment, the most popular fictional game company in the world. The company's WW2 FPS and fantasy MMORPG are central to the plot. Suarez is even able to weave elements of game culture into the real world, as the Daemon awards experience points to its minions for completing tasks, and rewards them with ultra-high-tech gizmos that can have almost magical abilities. It even lets them see things in \\"D-space,\\" a 3D environment superimposed over the real world GPS grid, projected onto specially designed sunglasses, and complete with wireframe buildings and callouts for other Daemon followers which indicate their relative strength and experience level, just like the stuff that appears over a character's head in an MMO. That all may sound goofy and a little dorky, but it is seamlessly integrated with the world of the book and makes perfect sense in the contexts where it's used.<br /><br />I dread this book being turned into a movie, because it's just the kind of thriller that Hollywood loves, and it's chock full of just the kind of technology that Hollywood inevitably gets so very wrong. Suarez makes it all come to life so effortlessly. You never feel like you're in some technology training seminar, but at the same time, he gets enough of the nuts and bolts across to make it believable and comprehensible even to a technology tyro. The bittersweet thing about this book is that I'm sure that in just a few years it will all be quaint and dated - a snapshot of the possibilities available at the turn of the 21st century.<br /><br />I recommend reading it while it's still awesome.em see things in \\"D-space,\\" a 3D environment superimposed over the real world GPS grid, projected onto specially designed sunglasses, and complete with wireframe buildings and callouts for other Daemon followers which indicate their relative strength and experience level, just like the stuff that appears over a character's head in an MMO.

B003FVI2KQ|3.0|Don't get all excited thinking this is going to be much better than the quad core, because it's only a pinch better. It has two more cores but still has the same amount of L3 cache, leaving less cache per core compared to the quad core. If you're a gamer or want speed out of single threaded applications or games, you will have better performance with the quad core.    Also, I hope you're ready to buy an aftermarket cooler, because this thing runs HOT. I am getting over 60C at load playing games like Fallout Vegas and they're not even that demanding. AMD doesn't have a good track record with heat. Even though the heat sink they provide with this processor LOOKS good (it's got copper heat pipes and is fairly large) it's all flash, it doesn't do a good job at all for cooling. Better look into getting a giant Zalman or Cooler Master heat sink fan if you want to load this thing. However, you should note that AMD will not honor your warranty if you don't use their fan, but I'm not trying to tempt fate. It's not going to last at these temperatures.    Overall, it's not a bad processor. Running Windows 7 alone gets pretty good performance when multitasking heavily like I do. Just be careful and make sure you download a temperature monitoring program that will tell you the ACTUAL temperature of your processor like RealTemp.    If you're a gamer, go with a slightly more expensive Intel quad core i7 processor. This processor WILL game just fine, but you will get better performance elsewhere. The benchmarks on the net show Intel i5 and i7 to absolutely crush this AMD 6 core processor. If I had a chance to do it again, I just would have bought the AMD quad core; it gets almost identical performance.    I suppose all of these issues are due to the fact that AMD rushed this processor to market to compete with Intel. I'm not a big fan of Intel even if they are better; I've been loyal to AMD for a long time. I'm just a bit disappointed in this particular model. They need to get their act together and stop focusing on these useless added technologies that nobody will ever use.

B004OA2G0E|5.0|really cannot understand some of the hate for this record. it's cohesive with a sense of purpose and a groove that would put younger bands to shame. cerebral yes, inaccessible, hmmm maybe but mediocre? certainly not. yes it may only be 8 songs, but each one of those songs bursts with its own individual idea. separator, lotus flower, bloom, codex and give up the ghost (over half the album guys) have to be up there with their very archive best. my advice would be to sit down, clear your mind and allow this record to take over. believe me, it's worth the while; once it's ingrained itself in your musical mind, i think you'll want to keep it there. oh, and a good soundsystem will really help bring out all the subtle nuances in production - godrich's really outdone himself on this.
B003UESJHE|5.0|From the first time I saw \\"The King's Speech\\" in the theater, I knew I would own this for my own. This is more than a movie about a man finding his voice. It is about friendship, mutual respect, integrity, courage and the sometimes dubious value of \\"professional certification.\\" Most remarkably, this wonderful film touches all of these themes so deftly and warmly.<br />The main architect of the English language, William Shakespeare, wrote in Twelfth Night, \\"Be not afraid of greatness: some men are born great, some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them.\\" Prince Albert, cum King George VI (the father of the current Queen), had greatness dubiously thrust upon him when his brother, King Edward, abdicated the throne to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson. But Albert (known as Bertie to his family who treated him cruelly) did not seek, did not want, and was not prepared for this royal role for one reason: He spoke with a ferocious and painful stammer. It was difficult for him to get out a simple sentence. He wondered aloud, how could he lead a nation when he could not even speak to them?<br />Bertie's caring and supportive wife, Elizabeth (played lovingly by Helena Bonham Carter), wants to spare him public humiliation, so she seeks out so-called \\"professional\\" speech therapists. Despite their credentials, they seem to be little more than hacks. One prescribes the soothing and relaxing qualities of cigarettes to Bertie. Another employs the tried, trite and untrue method of putting marbles in his mouth. No one seemed able to help.<br />Then Elizabeth finds Lionel Logue, a struggling (if not failed) actor, and to boot, an Australian, an emigre to the England from their penal colony. Portrayed by the great Geoffrey Rush, Lionel has no academic credentials, but his confidence, skill and humanity are the stuff of success.<br />To begin, he insists on interacting with Bertie on a first name basis. No titles here. (Having worked in hospitals myself, I found that this practice was important. I learned not to use the title \\"Doctor\\" and to address physicians by their names, forcing them to deal with me as a colleague.) Furthermore, Lionel is firm with his patient, insisting on excellence and never patronizing him. He believes that Bertie can be successful, and he wants Bertie to believe it, too.<br />As Prince Albert, Colin Firth gives an inspiring performance. As the father of a son who has triumphed over stuttering, I could feel his frustration at the inability to get out a simple sentence. I sympathized with his stumbles over a conga line of consonants. But I could also sense the satisfaction that comes with overcoming this problem. (I have learned from my son and others that, like alcoholics, there are no \\"former\\" stammerers. One beats the condition every day through sheer determination.)<br />At one point in the film, Lionel's honor is called into question. He is accused of taking on the job merely to have the cache of a royal client. But at this very moment we realize that Lionel has acted exactly opposite to that charge. He assumed this assignment because of commitment to his craft rather than the bloodlines of his student. (In fact, Lionel displays a measure of disdain for royalty, which is not unusual for someone from outside England.) Furthermore, he becomes Albert's friend, confidante and counselor. Through their interactions, we learn the roots not only of Albert's speech but also of his underlying uncertainty.<br />After all the preparation is done, and when it comes time for the new King George to inform the British Empire of their entry into World War II, director Tom Hooper makes us feel not only the historical import of the event, but Albert's singular success. The camera follows his walk to the recording studio through long corridors strewn with cables, symbolizing his long journey to get to this moment. As Albert speaks, Hooper cuts to visuals of listeners who would fight this war for the Crown: factory workers, truckers and the middle class. We also see signs at the transmitters that show how the message is being broadcast to the colonies of the U.K., a symbol of the reach of the new King's power.<br />One could argue that Albert was born great just by virtue of his royal lineage. But he had greatness thrust upon him in an unusual turn of unforeseen and unprecedented events. Through his own courage and the help of a loving partner-in-life and a new-found friend, he achieves his own measure of majesty. It is a simple story made great by the telling, a footnote to history that we may not have known. As a speaker and communicator, this film resonates with me. As a man, as a husband, and as a friend of others, I find it unforgettable and inspiring.middle class.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a fan of the show so I'm biased.  I love the series.  For a little over $22, this is well worth the money.  There are a few things about this product that buyers should be aware of:  the packaging seems cheap and flimsy, and the print quality on the box is not the best I've seen.  But for $22 its a steal and the DVDs all work perfectly so far (I've only watched the first disc yet).  Also, it's not a big deal but Amazon prime claims to ship in 2 days but in reality it's more like 4 days.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|A great album.  Soulful and beautiful.  Love it and definitely a must have.  Every song is great.
B004Y8Y26C|5.0|The album itself is an incredibly well done soundtrack which greatly enhanced the movie itself! That being said, take note that the album is not necessarily a stand-alone album. Many of the tracks are shorter and specifically were for certain scenes in the movie (as a soundtrack should be).     So what are the songs you want to hear?     Hanna's Theme - Easily one of the best songs on the album and a work of Chemical Brothers art! If you have to buy just one song, but this one    Container Park - This is the rocking electronic song that makes you want to work out harder, run quicker, and drive faster. It was used in the trailer, and repeatedly sampled throughout the movie. You'll recognized it right away if you have seen the movie!     Enjoy the music!

B0018AOA8E|5.0|This Concert was the pinnacle of Van Halen. I own the guitar tab book which is currently not in production anymore and the DVD. This concert is Edward at his best in my opinion. You Can't go wrong with this purchase. I currently play almost 1/2 of the songs listed on this album including 316 \\"The Live Version\\" Or Solo if you will. Flawless performance and as I said earlier a lot more harmonics and squeals in these songs than the raw version. If Your a Van Halen Fan. I would Suggest This album and the DVD Performance as well. They are sure to shock and awe with great stage performances and solo's from everyone in the band and also excellent sound quality. Amazon Brought a great product to the table with these. After listening to the album the DVD is 100% better of the live concert. A must have for Van Halen Fans. As I said earlier I strongly recomend the DVD of the concert as well. It's what I believe to be the best performance by this band to date. Thank You Amazon.com

076790592X|1.0|In my L.A class this was required reading. When I picked up this book, I wasn't hoping for much. A few heartfelt memoirs, perhaps a charming anecdote. What I recieved was pure filth, right in the kisser. It was an emotionally manipulative and a blatant marketeering of a slow, heartstring-pulling death. I learned absolutely nothing about how to live. This is a sad and pathetic attempt of piggybacking off of someone else's suffering in order to attract those in want of a tear-jerker. I find that Mitch is highly insensitive to Morrie's plight, and flew down there only when he was in need of a story. I have read many teary books as required reading, and am thoroughly fed up with this new age, sympathetic trash.
1582432678|5.0|I too loathed Eva Katchadourian and the author's need to use every word in a thesaurus to say the simplest things, but since my friend raved so much about the book, kept going on--begrudgingly. Boy am I glad I did and after about 100 pages (yes, I know it's a long way in) realized Eva's sometimes tortuous overuse of language is a huge part of her personality. Her constant negativity,judgmental and hyper opinionated-attitude towards everything and everyone really sets up the reader to wonder the BIG question: \\"nature\\" versus \\"nurture\\" on child behavior. That said, you can't discount Eva's husband and his role in the development of \\"KK\\". The scene when Eva and Kevin went out for dinner was my favorite part of the book. Her being set-up to rant about her usual target and Kevin's rebuttal was just brilliant. I also enjoyed the narration aspect of Eva writing to her husband about things that happened in the past to be a refreshing way to read a story---and one as complex as this makes sense. Give the book a chance. It is chilling and will make you think. I can't wait for the film release!
1439156816|5.0|Highly recommended if you're a writer or an avid reader. This is a combination memoir (as the title says) and King's philosphy on writing. You won't find many How-To lists here, but his advice is invaluable and mirrors what other writers have said on the craft of good writing.     I love his concept of unearthing a story in the way an archaeologist uncovers a fossil. The idea of being completely truthful in work rang true, as well as many of his pointers on character description.     My only experience reading King's work prior to this was 400 pages of the epic 1,000+ page \\"It.\\" I had no allegience to his work. I've seen some of his movies, but I'm definitely interested in reading his work.

B004SEVPWQ|5.0|I thought it's a typical pool game that will get old, but I found it to be fun and kinda addicting. You can play with others in person or online. If you don't feel like challenging real people, you can play against the computer. Essentially, it's a good game.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I thought I knew a lot about reading people and while some of the information in this book I knew and didn't know I knew, most of it was very eye opening.  Clarified lots of misconceptions from other books and myths.  Gave me more confidence almost immediately and I'm going to read it again.  I'm also looking for more books by this man.  Brilliant.  No, you won't be a CIA agent by the end.  But you will look at people differently and you won't be \\"in the dark\\" about how they really feel about you.  That in itself is worth it's weight in gold.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This movie is a sheer delight for children and adults alike.  Mr Dahl, has a very simplistic, yet humourous way of introducing us to the main character, Mr Fox, who is a very cunning and stealthy character.  He has to be if he is to steel the chickens without being caught.<br />I enjoyed this movie so much that I bought the book of the same name.  I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to be entertained by a master storyteller.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I absolutely love this mobile!! I just received it in the mail today and my 2-month-old son was fussing up a storm.  As soon as I got the mobile put together (which was easy) and I laid him underneath it, he stopped crying and started smiling and cooing at it!  I actually couldn't believe it!  He doesn't even smile at his dad or me yet!  I love the music options and the softness of the spin and of course the peek-a-boo leaves.  The dangling toys are adorable and seem to be smiling down!  I would highly recommend this product to anybody!

B001K3JF7K|1.0|Ms. Krall slaughters the Portugese, drags far too many notes, and seems to be lethargic throughout most of this weak effort.  Start with \\"Este Seu Olhar\\" and you'll see why Thai versions of Hank Willams loses soemthing in the translation. She also makes the idea of getting accustomed to someone you love's face dull!   This disc lacks synchronous music, absolutely bad \\"theater\\" and sadly just bad performances by a very talented artist. She might just be worn out!  I'd recommend sticking to the more early stuff, and forget you ever read this.
030746363X|5.0|Got the 4-Hour Body book to drop weight, and found out it is filled with lots of amazing things and ideas. I saw Tim Ferris (the author) on the Doctor Oz television show and even Dr. Oz was totally surprised with several of his ideas (and loved them, and also proved that they actually do work). This book has chapters on getting abs fast (if you want that) and other chapters that I still need to read. I even bought one for my son, because I didn't want to give mine up. I loaned it to my doctor and he has ordered one for himself. He loves it too!
0743454537|3.0|This is one of the few books for which a majority of the ratings will be either five stars or one star, with little in between.  Quite a feat.  This fact right alone -- as well as the NUMBER of reviews -- should tell you something.    Until I reached the last 25% or so of the novel, I had a hard time staying interested enough to read for more than twenty minutes at a time.  When I was about halfway through the book I finally threw up my arms and told myself that I'm going to sit down and read until I've finished it (I read the remaining half of the book from midnight to 8am -- the book is estimatedly 143,000 words).  Perhaps the problem is in how much the narration moves among various characters -- and across time.  There are MANY flashbacks.  All the jumping around is handled fairly well, but still.  This book has A LOT of emotion and a lot of premise (Kate's struggle) ((*advantages*)), but not much actual plot.  Overall, I'm not too keen on Picoult's writing style, and I am conflicted about the book's structure.    One of the things that most annoyed me was how often Picoult ends a scene with a certain sentimental tone -- this element was VERY overused.  I am glad others have also mentioned being annoyed by this.      ** spoiler alert **     The biggest topic of discussion for this book, certainly, is the ending.  As someone quite knowledgeable about the art of novel writing, I am conflicted.  My initial reaction?  I was absolutely devastated; I wanted to crawl under all my blankets and just cry for hours.  I felt like my best friend had just died.    I was depressed for the next few days.    In the first hour after finishing the book, I shared my thoughts with my sister, who'd already read it.  At the time, me and her both agreed that there really was no better way to end the book.  A day later, I felt very strongly that the book should have ended differently.    Now, a month after finishing it?  I have decided that there was no other way for the book to end strongly.  The unfortunate consequence with the book ending the way it does however, of course, is that the premise of the book (parents conceiving a child for the sole purpose of having an exact genetic match for another child), on the surface at least, goes unchallenged.  One would certainly think that one would want this to be challenged (one would want \\"justice\\") by the main character finally being free, able to have her own life.    It is definitely a dilemma.    One has to realize that if things end the way the characters expect them to, the ending is boring and the novel, in effect, loses it's strength.      *  *  *      I feel so, so sorry for Anna.  I will never forget her.
0525422943|5.0|I read If I Stay about a month ago.  And just finished Where She Went about an hour ago.  First, I loved If I Stay.  I'll probably need some more time and possibly a second read before I decide how much I loved Where She Went.  Don't get me wrong, I did love it...it's just that the entire time reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about a movie called Before Sunset (which is also a sequel).  That movie and this book share SO much in common, that I partly felt as if I was reading a novelization of it.  Of course, there is enough uniqueness that that's not quite the whole truth, but it was enough to bother me and make me feel like I knew exactly where this was going.  I'm not going to say if this book ended the same way that movie did (since that would be a big spoiler), but I will say that by the end, the similarities stopped bothering me and I was able to just enjoy the story being told.    Definitely a must read for fans of the original, and something I'll certainly read again down the road.
1423389387|4.0|Let's just start off by saying that I really liked this book that originated as a random choice from a Vine List. The author has the ability to weave a tale using both the unique & exciting parts of our hero's day to day life & bumping them up against the mundane. This is a big giant book that draws the reader in as a participant rather than an observer; I was reminded of some of King's hefty works like The Stand and his Gunslinger series or even Tolkien's Rings. Some other reviewers have complained about the overwhelming amount of detail and have categorized it as meaningless. I disagree. To me this detail is the fabric of the story - the very magic that brings it to life. It's a great feeling to be able to live in a book and it's this descriptive detail that builds your world.<br /><br />As much as I claim to enjoy this book I did find the main character Kvothe rather one dimensional in an over-sexed 16 year old way (but then doesn't this describe ALL 16 year old boys?). I did not read Book 1 of this proposed trilogy but have subsequently ordered it and also look forward to the completion of Book 3. Also, may I say that this review refers to the audio version of the book. Nick Podehl's reading was top notch. His interpretation of Patrick Rothfuss's characters lent an extra layer of drama to this work. When the book started to drag a little Podelhl kept the characters moving in spite of the authors short siesta.<br /><br />After reading the other books I may come back and amend this review but I'm sure it will be for the better.

0439813786|5.0|Hugo's life isn't great, but he knows what to expect. Now that his father is dead and his uncle has abandoned him, he wakes up every morning early enough to steal milk and pastries from store fronts. He spends most of each day keeping the clocks of the Paris train station in working order so no one suspects that his uncle has disappeared. And every night he tries to repair a mechanical man his father left to him in the desperate hope he'll find a message about his past. It isn't until a book-loving girl and her mysterious godfather bring a new element of uncertainty to his life that Hugo wonders what it is he is supposed to do with his future.<br /><br />The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a beautifully told story, half graphic novel and half traditional book, about a young man searching for vocation. In helping an old man recover his calling, he may just uncover his own. It won the Caldecott Medal in 2007.
B00005JSGK|3.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in 1962 and thought it was thrilling and fun.  I just got back from a trip to South Africa and can appreciate even more the filming of catching these animals.  However, our culture has changed so much since 1962 that I was really distressed to see that almost everyone, in every scene, was smoking a cigarette.
B003UHYSDK|1.0|Disappointing to say the least. I've been a fan of Black Mountain sence the self titled album, and since I saw them on tour with Coldplay of all bands. this album marks a departure from their hazy, melodic, poetic, haunting stoner roots for something much more arranged and orchestrated. Gone are the raw garage rock that captivated me in favor of something much more produced and polished. the production on the album is absolutely stellar, the mixing and layers of sound might be exactly what some are looking for. on a personal opinion, they're going down a rabbit hole I just cant follow. I miss the stoner vibe that is only hinted on, but never built on in this album, as opposed to their previous albums.<br />Overall, I'd say you should download this and sample it before you even think about dropping cold hard cash.
B000SEIDR0|4.0|I thought this book would be interesting and it certainly was.  Since reading it I have heard some criticism charging that the book is liberal or biased.  Maybe it is a little biased against industrial agriculture?  There probably is no such thing as true objectivity.  On the other hand, as a Penn State trained Agronomist I found it to be enlightening and very interesting.  For me it is a bit of a feel good book because it reinforces some of my personal bias:<br /><br />a.) Industrialized food systems have saved us from mass starvation (or maybe they have enabled unsustainable overpopulation?), but there is a \\"rotten underbelly\\" if you consider sustainability and humanitarian concerns.<br /><br />b.) The commercial organic food system is a total scam.<br /><br />c.) You can't do better than what you grow  or harvest locally in your own back yard be it vegetable, mineral, or animal.  I'll admit I am one of those people who does not have the time, but I grew up eating home raised food and it can't be beat.<br /><br />So, set your own bias aside and enjoy a well written and informative book.  I for one am trying to avoid consuming corn derivatives since reading this.  Need to stop for gas, oh well.............

0345522478|2.0|This is a difficult review to write -- I really wanted to like this book.  Clearly either the author or the publisher have went to a lot of work to make it succeed, ie, it has a great cover, nice web-page, and apparently there are a lot of people who do like it.  I had to wonder if there's an unbroken rule among the writing/publishing world that when someone sends you an ARC to reivew, that you must give that book a good review.  I am not going to go into a lot of detail about the book, other people have already spoken about the book, and there is a teaser on the web-site which can be read for free.    My biggest problem with the book stems from my difficulty in buying that a 2100 year old Druid, who happens to be the LAST of his kind, would sound and act like a 22-year old frat boy wannabe tough guy.  Then there are the sex scenes -- from the 1950's.  As in the main character is flirting with a goddess, who decides to take him for a ride -- and cut to her rubbing his chest, apparently in his bedroom, although even that isn't specifically stated.  It's just like June and Ward in Leave it to Beaver, if we never see the bed or see June and Ward in anything less than their suits and dresses, maybe we'll believe that Wally and Beaver came through via immaculate conception.  Between the left out sex scenes, and the lack of maturity in our hero, I had a very hard time finishing this book.  There is a great deal more telling than showing going on throughout the book, and this makes the scenes between fights drag.  I felt like there were things an editor could have caught in a book that had this much publisher support, caught and recommended some changes.  Regarding the demure sex scenes -- some readers might say, well, it's written from a male POV, and so his lack in mentioning anything about the sex is understandable.  I disagree, strongly.  Read the John Rain series by Barry Eisler -- also written from a male protagonist's POV, and the sex in those books is scorching.  Aman can have sex, and even describe it in a way that appeals to both male and female readers.  I do not expect romance -- but to leave me with a 2100 year old Druid who can't describe the sex he is having with a goddess boggles my mind.  That is simply unbelievable.  The setting also could use some additional detail, and depth.  Even Harry Dresden managed the love making scene in Death Masks with Susan with depth, class, and sorrow that were near perfect for that scene.      Okay, the rant is over.  I apologize to anyone I've offended -- and I am not saying that the author is bad or ignorant or anything else.  He gave this his best shot, I'm sure.  But every book can use some polishing, some more than others.      The good things about the book:  original concept, and a potentially fascinating world.  These books have potential, the question is has the publisher given this author enough time to develop that potential into the kind of books people will read over and over again.  My Jim Butcher, Barry Eisler, Laurell K. Hamilton, and Ilona Andrews books are pretty battered from the many times they've been read, and most of them still have the same bang I enjoyed the first time around.  Some more than others, of course.   Hexed and Hammered are going to have a lot to make up for, and we'll see if they succeed where Hounded fell flat.
B004MKM8L8|3.0|The Deathly Hallows part 1 is by far the slowest, least fun packed Harry Potter movie made to date.  It's strange to have character developement in the second to last film of a series, but to their credit, the trio really stepped up to the job and gave us some top notch acting. So although, I'm glad they split the last book into two movies (part 2 should be AWESOME!), it made for a somewhat boring part 1. But let's face it...you still have to buy this DVD because IT'S HARRY POTTER and you can't break up the set.
B004I11VZ0|1.0|This is a bad movie. Poor story line and development. Terrible english Dubbing. Donnie Yen make Bruce Lee look like a Great Actor! The fight scenes are OK but again, he's no Bruce Lee. My only hope is that Suncoast Movie Store will buy it back for $3. Do Not Buy This Movie!!!
B004LAIU4I|5.0|So Beautiful or So What takes us on another wonderful journey. Paul Simon can turn a phrase like no one else. He's one of a kind and just plain fun.

B003SNJYSK|2.0|After reading the Stieg Larsson trilogy I thought there was not another writer who was so gifted.  I did a bit of research and saw that Jo Nesbo was a well regarded Scandinavian author of a similar ilk.  Boy was I disappointed.  I read Redbreast and kept waiting to be taken in like I was with the Larsson books.  I kept hoping and hoping that it would get better, but to no avail.  In the end I would give this book a big yawn at best.  I will keep on searching for that author/book that really did it for me like Stieg Larsson.
0321356683|5.0|Wish all books were like this - OR - rather - All programming languages had a book like this.  This is not a basic / novice level book - but assumes that the reader has already used Java for a number of years.  It is best to read this book slowly absorbing the thoughts / concepts and what the author is conveying. Some of the things could be subtle but - if they are tried out - after reading each article it makes more sense.    The author had written a lot of the core Java libraries while at SUN - and you can see his name in the source files in the JDK. The author has complete clear and crisp understanding of the concepts and lucidly explains the points - with clear small and right examples.    I used to read this book - 1 article a day and then try out the concepts conveyed in the article.    I had read the 1st edition of the book long time back - and it clearly - imprinted in my mind - why hash() function needs to be written and the deficiencies of a bad hash function.    This new edition includes all the new features of the language as incorporated in Java 1.5 other than the concurrency related classes.    Only deficiency of the book, I do wish - it had some more articles about the Concurrency related libraries that were introduced in Java 1.5.     Anyone who would like to know more about the internals of Java - should purchase this book and read it
0762434279|1.0|This book while on the suface may seem helpful it leaves out to many important things.  The biggest is that rich people know that money does not solve their propblems. Secondly that a meaning full  vocation is more satisfactory that getting rich. Both of my Grandfathers were COE's of big companies and they both wanted their desendents to be well educated and   have captivating careers. The rich usually have professional investment companies who's job it is to preserve the wealth for generations. This book basical asks middle class people to risk it all on investments that if they go bad can cause you to loose everything inclueding your own home. His suggestions only work in an up market , which we most likely wont see for years. Does he tell people what to do if they are leveraged for say 500k on investment property that is now worth 200K ?  Remember when this happens rents start going down too. How would one service that dept on lower rents and vacancies that can't be filled? Why are investors not snapping up the 100' of thousands of forclosed homes on the market? Ask you self what the real exposure you have to a highly leveraged portfolio. Who was the rich dad in his book? was he really rich or just some one who worked really hard for money with no other purpose in life.
B004UNB1R4|5.0|Robbie Robertson struck gold with his 80's solo album and colaborated with the likes of U2 and Peter Gabriel. It has long been a favorite album.

Skillful song writing and solid execution makes this another \\"desert island classic\\". I highly recommend it.

B004RC8NXI|1.0|Outside of a few funny lines and outside of a good money making day for all studio staff involved this flick is a  two-weeks-from-now forgettable 90 minutes. It's actually a bit sad to see Kutcher's talent wasted on formula romantic comedies, but again it's good pay for a day's work which is about how long it takes to make these. The important criticism is that the storyline is a quilt of ideas borrowed (meaning: many times recycled) from other rom-com flicks e.g. detached, insecure chick, whose a bit smarter than the lowly gardener (usually a gardener or some manual trade that allows physiques to be shown); dumb romantic enticements such as fast food restaurants and veggies for flowers; friends to act as either rational or provocateur foils -  all done before. Oh, and the usual (funny to film crew) same camera angled sex scenes seen in every similar movie.
038566284X|1.0|I like to give positive reviews for an author's hard work if I can, and I like to hold on to the books I have enjoyed. In fact I usually like almost everything I read. I hate to say that I really couldn't get this book to the used book store fast enough.  I had such high hopes too__I loved the cover art, the title and the premise.  The story even started out intriguingly, but lost ground quickly. The triteness of the good twin/evil twin device, the elements thrown in for shock value, and the general meandering of the plot towards the end all just made me wince.  It was really painful for me to finish it.  Even though I didn't find it as bad as \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" (my choice for the worst book ever!), this book makes it to my personal over-hyped, under-performed list.

B004NOH9LW|4.0|Though most would say that this movie is about the 'hereafter' and how it does not answer questions, I think its a nice (yet somewhat rusty performances) way of looking at lives which suffer the loss of a loved one, and how they turn to the past looking for answers in the future.

1594202710|5.0|When it comes to China, it's hard to think of a person or diplomat who has served as long and has as much hands-on, working knowledge of the relations between the red giant and the West as Dr. Henry Kissinger. In fact, it's impossible.<br /><br />With engagements dating back nearly a half-century and covering administrations on both sides of half a dozen rotating regimes, Kissinger has devoted his life's work to bridging the gaps between the U.S. and foreign entities, with China being at the top of the list. In this voluminous, 586-page work, Kissinger warns of the U.S.'s desire to bring its own democratic morals to a land whose sovereignty is of paramount import. Only by studying the past, Kissinger argues in \\"On China,\\" can one find the middle ground that will prevent the two superpowers from coming to loggerheads in the future.<br /><br />At one time, China and the U.S. shared a common enemy in the Soviet Union. This triangulation was the basis for much of the early U.S.-China detente as promulgated by the diplomat's early visits to China under President Nixon. With the fall of the Soviet regime, the relationship evolved into an economic battlefront where U.S. interference (over democracy, human-rights, economic agendas, etc.) was looked down upon by the Chinese though, of course, issues related to these positions continue to remain in force today.<br />Along the way, Kissinger relates stories of his relationships with Mao Zedong and the post-Mao leaders (Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemen and Hu Jintao) with whom he has continually interfaced. Mao, he states, was an often cryptic and mercurial leader and those in the post Mao world have, at times, adopted some of his confusing attributes in his wake. Much is made of conflicts - from Vietnam to Taiwan to Tiananmen Square - where Chinese and U.S. policies remained at odds, while some form of shuttle diplomacy prevented either side from attempting a massive outbreak.

B004ZGI2KK|1.0|There are no words to describe how bad this is. Sure it is visually beautiful, but for no discernible reason. Just pieces of a puzzle that don't fit. Why are the haystacks shaped like cones? Why is there a giant iron elephant? The movie is incoherent and poorly acted. I mean, come on - I was a teenage girl not that long ago (the target audience, clearly) and I did not then, and do not now, appreciate being shamelessly pandered to.<br />This is NOT a gothic romance, and it is NOT even a good teenage movie. Go see Jane Eyre or pretty much any John Hughes movie if that is what you are looking for.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins was amazing. It's such a good book because you never knew what was going to happen next. What happened in the book is that a sixteen-year-old girl named Katniss Everdeen takes her little sisters spot in the Hunger Games. As she is allowed to take the spot, she is officially named a tribute for the Hunger Games and she meets new people along the way towards the Games. When the Games begin, she has to wait 60 seconds because of the land mines the Capital has place out and when the 60 seconds are over they rush over to this giant horn called the Cornucopia and grab any supplies that they can get to. But Katniss is only able to retrieve a small orange bag and but it was a good thing to grab because what was in it was a thin black sleeping bag that reflects body heat, a pack of crackers, a pack of dried beef strips, a bottle of iodine, a box of wooden matches, a small coil of wire, a pair of sunglasses (but if you read the book you find out they allow you to see in the dark), and a empty half-gallon plastic bottle. After that Katniss finds a tree and sleeps in it with her new cozy sleeping bag. She is suddenly awakened when she hears footsteps and see a fire that starts to bloom, but Katniss notices that the other tributes have formed an alliance and start chasing after the girl who started the fire, and its then the girl starts to run and the alliance kills the girl. Then Katniss is up in a tree again and spots the alliance right under her tree and a girl named Rue who is in the tree next to her tells her to cut a wasps nest down the tree and the alliance then gets stung by all the wasps or known as in the book, Tracker Jackets.   I have felt like Katniss once in the story right when she is in the arena, she becomes dehydrated and I have felt like that. I definitely liked the book. I would recommend this book to about any person because it's such a good book. My feelings for this book is strong, and my final opinion about this book isthat everyone should read this book.
031261246X|4.0|As an IT Security Professional myself, I approached this book with some skepticism. I assumed the typical ridiculous, outrageous misrepresentation of what a hacker is and what viruses can do, thinking this would be another thriller that was written solely to be made into a movie.    After the first few pages I could tell this would be something different, something refreshing: a techno-thriller that was actually quite accurate in its representation of the power a few motivated, angry hackers and less than dubious virus writes can have over our always-on, interconnected world. The technical details behind the scene are very accurate and are explained and described in a way that anyone could open this book up and understand/be terrified at the possibilities discussed.    Others here have criticized the sometimes wooden characters and, if I had to be picky, I would agree that this is the books weak point. It's hard to care for the characters after awhile and its clear they are simply in place to move the action forward. That being said, this was a great book and I recommend it to anyone interested in a good techno-thriller.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|A true death / black metal release from a band that has worked a long, hard journey to become the underground cult fame that they are.  This is true viking metal, harboring thoughts of Norse mythology (note: the Norse god Oden).  \\"With Oden On Our Side may or may not be a concept album; I wouldn't know.  But it's definitely a journey through the dark, sub-zero freezing cold and extremely brutal winters of the 3 countries north of the Baltic Sea.  On another note, the drumming is flawless and the heavy, downtuned monolith of guitars bursts out powerful and fast like a nuclear shockwave.  Hell, I am with THESE GUYS ON MY SIDE!!!<br /><br />Track breakdown:<br /><br />1. Valhall Awaits Me - 9/10<br />2. Runes to My Memory - 10/10<br />3. Asator - 9/10<br />4.

1936594293|5.0|I could read P&P over and over again, watch a million film adaptations, and never get sick of the seething love story behind it. The story of Elizabeth & Darcy is what all fiercely independent women (or those of us who would like to become such) dream of -- uncompromising love with a man who is somehow both kind and sexy and equal in every way.<br /><br />No one does romance like the Brits, and most subsequent romance stories are just rehashing the tales of Austen, Bronte, and the like.
B002MX9YJQ|4.0|Tricky - Maxinquaye (original album released in 1995)<br /><br />MAXINQUAYE is legendary and one of my top all-time favs. Extremely innovative, dark and sexy. In fact, with a little selective programing, I consider it to be a \\"go-to\\" album for a night of intimate sensuality. Most people reading this no doubt know how great it is, so I'll focus on the bonus disk in this set.<br /><br />This is a five-star album in a great package with great sound including a good but less-than-stellar collection of remixes. Worthwhile for hard-core fans, but the more casual listener probably won't need to bother with it. I can't imagine that very many people will want to put the bonus disk on and listen to it front to back. In particular, hearing three versions of \\"Black Steel\\" can get rather tiresome in one sitting. Most of these mixes sound like a mish-mash of experimentation, demos and discarded ideas, but there is some worthwhile stuff here nevertheless.<br /><br />1) \\"She Devil (Rough Monitor Mix)\\" - is really a version of \\"Suffocated Love\\". I don't appreciate being lead to believe it would be a new song by the title. It's quite similar to the album version, a little bit more skeletal with some additional vocal loops and turntable scratches. Inferior to the album version. ***<br /><br />2) \\"Ponderosa (Dobie's Rub Part 1)\\" - A drum track replaces the marimba sound and some of the music itself is different. It's got a breezy feel, some guitar, vocal effects and other interesting sonic touches. Tricky's vocals are randomly interspersed. This is a very good remix. ****1/2<br /><br />3) \\"Slick 66 (Commercial 12\\" Remix)\\" - a version of Slick Rick's \\"Children's Story\\" which also appears in a different version on Tricky's NEARLY GOD album. Features a decent slow jungle beat as Tricky recites the story. Quasi-hip-hop. It's cool, but not really very impressive. ***<br /><br />4) \\"Overcome (Bungle Mix)\\" - a great song, disassembled and jumbled up. It's only 2 1/2 minutes long, but it has several disjointed segments and it's much more frenetic than the album version. When Martina sings, \\"When we funk we'll hear beats\\", the song abruptly shifts into an intense, breathy rhythm segment. (note - \\"funk\\" appears in the CD booklet but it actually sounds like another word I can't repeat here) ***3/4<br /><br />5) \\"Brand New Your Retro (Alex Reece Remix)\\" - Another rather bare bones remix, this track is dominated by a bad-ass bass and drum kit - a little ironic since most remixes tend to pile on the effects. The minimal approach here is quite effective. ****<br /><br />6) \\"Black Steel (Been Caught Steeling Remix)\\" - This version's overlayed with lots of nasty electric guitars. Powerful! ****1/2<br /><br />7) \\"Aftermath (Version 1)\\" - As one might guess from the title, it just sounds like an early version of \\"Aftermath\\" before it blossomed into the great song it is. It's interspersed with lots of beat-less space. Doesn't really add much or offer any kind of reinterpretation but it's definitely interesting and worth hearing. ****<br /><br />8) \\"Just For The Hate Of It (Rough Monitor Mix)\\" - Tricky takes on the vocals and uses the words from \\"Abbaon Fat Tracks\\", one of MAXINQUAYE's best songs. Otherwise, this track sounds nothing like \\"Abbaon\\". Clanging drums and cymbals feature prominently as Martina chimes in here and there along with some tinkling piano and spacey effects. It's a bit jarring and scattershot which will no doubt appeal to some. I myself appreciate disconcerting music and while Tricky is a master of this approach, this mix is only moderately successful...but it's definitely something off the beaten path. ***3/4<br /><br />9) \\"Overcome (Acapella - Rough Monitor Mix)\\" - Track 10 comes much closer to a capella which leads me to suspect that the track titles have been mislabeled. Here we have another mish-mash of styles that can turn on a dime. Tricky is certainly tricky in that regard. After a minute or so, a propulsive beat with a droning bass settles in along with a looped single-note vocal, sort of an operatic sigh. Martina's \\"Karmacoma\\" vocals are great and the song is cool, but ultimately it just sounds like Tricky fooling around in the studio. ***1/2<br /><br />10) \\"Black Steel (Rough Monitor Mix)\\" - is pretty much just Martina once again singing NWA's \\"Black Steel\\" accompanied by little more than echo-y effects. And then a single snare hit starts up, occasionally missing the beat. To be perfectly honest, this track sounds really lame. *1/2<br /><br />11) \\"Overcome (2009 Remix)\\" - This version is quite subdued with atmospheric synths, drones and a beat made from marching boots. After all this time I was hoping for a much better remix of this song or at least a fresher approach. ***<br /><br />12) \\"Hell Is Round The Corner (2009 Remix)\\" - A dreamier take on \\"Hell\\" with some treated piano, strings and some swimming sonic touches, Martina hovering in the background. At one point softly corrosive synths are layered on and the whole thing slowly builds with intensity. The original bass line is conspicuously absent. Doesn't quite measure up to the album version, but credit Tricky for offering an interesting, very good reinterpretation on this one. ****1/2<br /><br />13) \\"Black Steel (2009 Remix)\\" - excellent dub-reggae version! Not really innovative but very well done and way cool. *****les in along with a looped single-note vocal, sort of an operatic sigh.

B001BPJJ82|4.0|Imagine the visual elements of \\"The Cell\\" spliced with the storytelling of  \\"One Thousand And One Arabian Nights\\" and then retold through the eyes of a little girl.<br /><br />This surreal visionary experience of storytelling from several points of view (that of the storyteller interacting with his target audience) unfolds in such a way as to become a part of your awareness, a gentle reminder of the fantastic, mythical and magical components of human interaction.  This is the closest thing to a fairy tale for adults I have witnessed in a long, long time.  Breathtaking does not even begin to describe the cinematography. The colors, the framing, costumes, lighting, and the backdrops are gorgeous; like something out of a dream. If this was just a visually moving film, that would be enough but the movie also has the kind of twist that we used to expect from M. Night Shyamalan.  It is based on the screenplay of the 1981 Bulgarian film Yo Ho Ho by Valeri Petrov.<br /><br />In a hospital on the outskirts of 1920s Los Angeles, an injured stuntman who has lost the will to live begins to tell a fellow patient, a little girl with a broken arm, a fantastical story about 5 mythical heroes. Thanks to his fractured state of mind and her vivid imagination, the line between fiction and reality starts to blur as the tale advances.<br /><br />The movie is visually aggressive and yet subtle in its humor.  If you are up for something that departs from standard American storytelling, give this one a try.  It's worth the price.  A most excellent visual fest!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you loved the BBC's P&P mini-series, you've probably been waiting years in hopes of discovering something new that provokes the same feelings. This is it. Richard Armitage is incredibly sexy in the lead role. The ending is not true to the book (so I hear -- have to read it right away), but I loved it. The chemistry between the two leads is amazing, and the story is very satisfying and certainly influenced by both Bronte & Austen, although set in a more politically charged Industrial Revolution setting which provides interesting historical context.
1439102724|2.0|I have read all of Jodi Picoult's books and there are only a few that I didn't particularly care for and this is one of them.  It didn't have the grab a hold of me and keep me guessing story that I like about her books.  I had the story figured out long before anything happened.  I guess were all have our off times and I felt this was defenitly one of hers.
B001FB55H6|2.0|The story line is exceptional. Movie stays true to the comic and has flashes of greatness that COULD have been enjoyed by the whole family had the director not felt the need to include large amounts of gratuitous, unecessary, and ultra-gruesome violence. I think it would have actually been MORE effective to have left much of the violence to the viewers imagination. Without the graphic violence, this would easily have been a five star review. Love the movie, but cant stand to watch it. What a shame.
B004QPOVF0|2.0|I guess a video journalism major was responsible for the editting of this DVD.  Way too many camera changes, way too many crowd shots.  I want to see AC/DC play.  I actually found the video a bit annoying to watch, but I'll play it again for the music.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|I got this app when Amazon had it as the free app of the day, but I used the free version for quite a while before that. It is very good at identifying songs as long as it has a good 15 seconds or so to listen without too much background noise.<br /><br />I probably only use it a couple of times a month, so I don't really need the paid version, but it is awesome when that new song you love comes on the radio and you can finally figure out who the artist is. And in my opinion, $4.99 is way too high of a price for this app. I think most people will get by just fine with the free version. -1 Star for the price.<br /><br />I have SoundHound installed as well. SoundHound has more features, but I find Shazam quicker and easier to use and when you are trying to identify a song before it goes off, this is important.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a must have app for me, but not the paid version. Save your money and get the free version.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to use, works well.<br />Cons: Way too expensive.

There you go, no need to read this book, because that is exactly the message of each chapter, and each chapter is exactly the same. This is spiritual advice at the elementary school level. It is one of the most over-rated books of all time. But perhaps, it is a good starting place for your children.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I was surprised by how fun this game is. It's a great way to kill 15 minutes and the fruit facts they give you after each game are interesting. Zen Mode is also good for keeping small children occupied for a bit while waiting in lines, etc.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like is that every now & then, it wouldn't 'read' my finger movements for a second and I could miss cutting one of the fruits. I have cleaned my phone (Droid) up a bit and it happens less, so I think it was just a lack of system resources.<br /><br />Conclusion: It's not my favorite game but it did earn a spot on my home screen.<br /><br />Pros: Fun and the price is right.<br />Cons: Sometimes it doesn't read your inputs for a brief time.

031603441X|1.0|I was really ambivalent about even buying this book, but couldn't resist a 50% off deal, figuring there might be something interesting here. The last person I would look to for the true story of the Rolling Stones is Keith. He has been nothing short of a revisionist over the last 30 years or so. His biggest sin is his continuing maginalization of Brian Jones, and lies, concerning Brian's contribution as leader of the band. Brian formed the band, recruiting all the players, naming the band and deciding what material they would record. It was Brian's band, until Mick and Keith, along with help from Andrew, hijacked it away from him on the issue of original material verses reinterpreting Blues and Rhythm and Blues songs by the greats. Brian was virtually a musicologist, and while Keith was still absorbed in learning Chuck Berry licks, and Mick was attending classes at the London School of Economics, Brian Jones was on a mission to crusade for  this amazing American music called R&B, wanting to share this music with the world. My take on this intentional omission is the less value he puts on Brian, the easier it is for him to sleep at night. For those readers who are unaware of what Keith should  have a guilty conscience about, too much to tell here. Bill has often said Keith \\"mis-remembers\\" the facts, which is obvious in this tall tale of a book. Self indulgent drivel. Bill wrote his own book \\"to set the record straght\\" There are some interesting things that come out of this however, such as Keith's revelation that once he got that first songwriting royalty check, he was a changed man. No wonder joint band credit of Nanker Phelge become Jagger Richard. The biggest travesty is how Keith claims  Jumpin' Jack Flash was written. The truth is Bill, Brian and Charlie arrived for a session ahead of Mick and Keith. Bill pounded out the chords for JJF on a piano, with Brian and Charlie jamming along. M&K arrived, heard it, liked it, gave it some lyrics, and a hit was born. Brian, Bill and Charlie seriously considered rising up against Mick and Keith over this, as a result of not being credited. When challenged for songwriting credit, they would accuse contributors of being greedy, when in fact they are the greedy ones. Mick and Keith still dredge up that hoary old bit about Brian paying himself 5 quid a week more for being the bandleader. Get serious guys! I could not read this entire book, I get too angry. This is not a Bio, it reads more like a novel.  Lastly, the saddest part of this book, is for those who do not know any better, and were not around when the original Stones were making musical history, they will actually take this to be truthful, and that is just not the case, it is pure Keith spin, if you want to know the true story, you will need to go elsewhere, like \\"Rolling Stones, Old Gods, Almost Dead.\\"
0439023491|4.0|To be completely honest; I wasn't all that thrilled with how this book was going along until I got about 2/3 of the way through it. It just felt like the author had run out of good ideas for the book. It seemed as if she was just retelling the first story with the changing of a few names and changing a very small part about the games themselves. I guess what I'm saying is that the book seemed very slow to me.<br /><br />Having said that, I am totally happy with the book as a whole now that I am done with it. Once I got into the last third of the book the rest of the buildup and story started to make more sense. I hate when books start out kind of slow because I have the tendency to lose interest and not want to finish them out. I'm glad that I didn't do that with this book. Collins found a way to bring it all back around with some pretty exciting action toward the end of the book. The ending of this book just leaves you waiting to see what is going to happen next.<br /><br />The characters from the first book continued to develop nicely through this book and there were some interesting new characters inserted. It will be interesting to see how they all come together in the third book. My hope for the third book is that it is as gripping through the whole thing as this one was through the last third of the book.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 4/5

B0017KIBAI|3.0|I've owned like 10 Gamecube controllers ever since the Gamecube came out.  I mostly play Super Smash Bros. Melee and then to Brawl.  The first controller I got was defective because the joystick would not respond fast enough as I wanted (by that, I mean it's ok for other games; but not for Super Smash Bros Brawl when I constantly move my joystick back and forth often and at a hard rate.)  Some people might say that I abuse the controller too much since I apply lots of force to move the joystick to avoid dieing off screen in Super Smash Bros Brawl.  My controllers in the past have worked perfectly for years.  So back to my Wii Controller...I exchanged my controller for a new one and the problem was slightly the same.  Now I am assuming that all these Wii Controllers are the same where there is a slight delay in the joystick.  I'm not saying that this controller is bad at all, but I expected it to the best of the best from all of these reviews. If you want to play an intense game like Super Smash Bros Brawl, then I would not recommend this controller at all.  Good things about controller: color is white and there's a long cord.
B004QITJC2|4.0|After viewing Hell's single \\"On Earth As It Is In Hell\\" some weeks ago, I eagerly awaited the full release of this moody masterpiece. Hell is a band which started big in the early 80's during the legendary NWOBHM movement. However, a series of increasingly distressing events forced the group to ultimately disband. But now, thanks to Andy Sneap and Nuclear Blast, they are back in full force. This is how metal should sound these days: a mixture of today's high quality production values mixed with the sound and attitude of yesteryear. \\"Human Remains\\" is slightly bogged down in some aspects, however. A number of the songs are padded out with sound clips or lunatic voice acting, which is good in some songs (ie \\"The Devil's Deadly Weapon\\" or \\"Save Us From Those Who Would Save Us\\"), but more often than not just pads out the songs to unnecessary lengths, causing them to feel a bit heavy-handed, though fairly epic. I hope dearly for a 2nd Hell album, although I would prefer one with shorter, more straight-to-the-point songs. That's just how I roll. Another aspect that bothers me a bit is the production work. While definatley solid, much of the album bogs down vocalist David Bower's singing. Unfortunate, as I think he's damn good, a quirky sort of fellow with vocal range going from a guttural growl in the vein of Venom's singer \\"Cronos\\", to high-pitched shrieks along the lines of Rob Halford or the late David Wayne of Metal Church.<br /><br />On the upside, there isn't a single real filler track on this album, and once each song gets going, it REALLY gets going. You have vicious straightforward rockers like \\"On Earth As It Is In Hell\\" and the catchy \\"Save Us From Those Who Would Save Us\\", fearsome epics like \\"Macbeth\\" or synth-heavy metal cuts like the memorable \\"Plague and Fyre\\".<br /><br />Overall, I think while the album can get a bit cumbersome and muddled, it still kicks, and it's heads and shoulders above most else calling itself heavy metal these days. Definatley recommended for fans of dark, occult metal and fans of NWOBHM in general.ns of dark, occult metal and fans of NWOBHM in general.
B003YOZNBU|5.0|This movie arrived super fast.  This movie was underrated due to the animosity felt towards Megan Fox, this movie still has the ability to be a franchise, but probably without Megan Fox, but Josh Brolin is an awesome actor and should be given this franchise (watch this movie for yourself).

1439102724|2.0|I was excited about the fact that the main character is a music therapist because I am a music therapist.  The beginning of the book was excellent and the portrayal of what goes on in a music therapy session was fairly spot on.  However, the book quickly deteriorated, thus two stars.  The plot was so contrived and the Christians in this book were portrayed in such a terrible light.  I am a Christian and I really take offense.  Why, Jodi, why?  You usually portray Christians in a better light.  Actually, I thought the minor characters were fairly wooden.  In addition, the whole premise of the book is morally offensive and over-reaching.  This book would have been better without the same-sex stuff in it.  Instead, she should have just focused on the infertility and troubled marriage part.  THAT would have made the book MUCH MORE BELIEVABLE and not morally offensive.  Sorry, Jodi.  You missed on this one.
B0010358CG|5.0|Now for most of the people who know me, I'm a shooter gamer buff. I like my guns, mecha, and just blowing stuff up and taking names. That said sometimes there WILL be a non-gaming media hit that catches my eye, probably because it's pretty much shooter gamer buff stuff in anime form. This recent sometime would be Appleseed: Ex Machina, where there are guns mecha, just blowing stuff up, and taking names, in anime form.    The movie starts off with \\"who are these people?\\" for the first ten minutes, that and the art style takes about that much time getting used to. The cel-shaded, oozing anime-style is obvious as some people mentioned before, the graphics seem like an up-scaled japanese game. After the opening scene ends and you're eyes adapt to the style, there is nothing but action really here on out. The characters don't take long to get used to and like, and if you're an Action/Romance buff like me who is a sucker for stuff like Robotech, there is plenty of low-key mushy stuff to mellow you out between the action-packed sequences.    The character design is a masterpiece, and like most anime buffs like me, you'll get your healthy dose of buff dudes, hot chicks, and cheesy but also relatable dialogue. That said, I was somewhat amazed that they were able to sneak in an F-bomb in this PG-13 title, but the scene with it is quite short. Also with that said the story is almost edging on Star Trek themes, to which I'm not going to spoil that point for you. Obviously they gave the movie universal Sci-fi appeal for the cautious westerners who may be put off with the anime design.    With that said, I found the movie a blast with my perfect mix of Action/Romance, Anime, and Cool/Attractive characters that I think was money beyond well spent. I see me definitely watching this movie multiple times and add to my personal Robotech collection.    In my opinion?    9.5/10
B003VANOFY|2.0|I was looking for a wireless headset that I primarily would use for gaming, but also music and movies after hours. After using G930 for two days, I ended up returning them and opting for a wired Sennheiser PC360 headset. The primary turnoff with the G930 was constant choppy sound while playing games. At random intervals, the sound would cut off for a few seconds. I made sure I was running the latest software from Logitech. I tried several suggestions from forums to help the sound quality, such as disabling on-board sound cards, making sure the battery was fully charged, moving the receiver away from other wireless transmitters, and plugging the receiver directly into the motherboard's USB. I disabled my WiFi and have nothing else in my house using the 2.4GHz frequency and that did not help. The choppy sound occurred in several games and while playing music.    On a positive note, the price was right at $120 and they felt solidly constructed and were comfortable. The ear cups do a good job of isolating outside noise. The mute and volume control built into the left ear cup was a nice addition. The mic seemed to work well and others said I sounded good.
B002ZG997M|5.0|I'm not big on reviewing movie quality as it is so subjective and with 350 other reviews there isn't much to add.  However This film quickly founds its place at the top of my collection.    The pacing and storytelling is very similar to Shyamalan films.  I was very tempted to be bored in the beginning of the film but quickly found the pacing and scenes of alleged insignificance were actually doing quite well at building a very dramatic plotline.      It doesn't hurt that the cast is stellar and they all work together very well.      The Blu-Ray quality is superb.  I have watched on a 24, 47, and 40 inch LCD and every pixel is simply a masterpiece.    This movie won't be for everyone.  Its a slow moving story that is finally fulfilled only in the very end, but once you arrive there it is well worth the journey.      The violence and some content is a little rough for younger viewers as the story is about a corrupt and devastated society that is literally fighting in a survival of the fittest scenario.  Throw in a few people that will do anything to make a play for power and you get some disturbing images that may turn a few stomachs.    The blu-ray features are decent and the price was extremely favorable when I bought this movie.  If you like a good story, even this post apocalyptic setting can provide a plot that most people will be pleasantly surprised by.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It's a great book, but I have to agree with some of the others. I didn't really like the ending. Seems like a little more could have been done with it.
B004RE29PO|1.0|I write this review not because I bought the \\"Aliens\\" BLU RAY, but as a precaution for prospective buyers.    I was curious to see if the BLU RAY edition of \\"Aliens\\" was the Director's Cut version, or theatrical. After a bit of research, the Director's cut of \\"Aliens\\" has a run time of 154 minutes, whereas the blu-ray's product description shows 137 minutes (theatrical).    As I said previously, I did not purchase this Blu-Ray edition of \\"Aliens\\", but the user reviews seem to reflect the DVD version, Special edition DVD, or the Anthology, and are not specific to the sale of the Blu-Ray \\"Aliens\\" alone.  It looks like the Anthology has the special features included, but really, who wants Alien3 or Alien: Resurrection (my opinion, ignore it if you're a fan)?    There are countless examples of other releases that exclude all the features for the purpose of re-releasing the title at a later date to profit. Initial Blu-Ray release of \\"Predator\\" was followed by the re-upscaled, release of \\"Predator: Hunter's Edition\\". The uncut version of \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" was only released on DVD, and the Blu-Ray Lord of the Rings trilogy initially only featured the theatrical versions, not the extended edition.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can I say? I love her voice, and this CD is awesome. I hope she is around for years! What talent!
B004MKM8L8|3.0|Well done film, good acting and SFX. However. My wife enjoys this series, she went to see it at the theaters without our son and myself, (we saved the money and used it to buy her the BluRay). My son and I are no where near the fan she is of this series. Deathly Hallows 1 was a gift for her I knew I'd be forced to watch. I kept falling asleep. She loved viewing the movie again. I prefer movies like Three Days Later, The Perfect Getaway and Insidious. My 2 cents. To each their own.
B001NESPHC|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of those rare albums in a sea of mostly useless music that captures the heart and allows one to take a reprieve from the noisy over-clocked world we live in. An exceptional mix of mournful, soulful, and reflective tunes intertwined with more rhythmic, enlivening songs that can both raise your spirits and comfort your worries, an ensemble with a wide gamut of emotions that is rarely conveyed in modern music. The album is highly original--I found no borrowed phrases from over-rated pop songs, and the orchestration is well varied, well-matched, and evocative of the sense of what she is trying to portray in each piece. A mark of distinction goes to the French tune 'Les Etoiles' (\\"The stars\\"), which lends it a European twist and adds a note of worldliness to the album. The quality of the recording is also commendable and crystal clear. Her voice is excellent, sensitive, and her style sophisticated and unparalleled. Well done, Melody!
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Is any of it based on fact (other than the existence of Caligula)? Here's my point: I don't care. If each scene was recorded in a scroll discovered by an archeologist (or film producer)in Rome, it still comes off as a vehicle for Bob Guccione to couch soft porn in a respectable setting. I only gave it one star because I'm afraid if I don't give it any stars the review won't get in the system, and I don't know how to give negative stars.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|In our opinion, highly underrated and always good for a laugh. Lots of great quoteable lines (Squeakems, Bring It On .. etc.) and greater characters (Kronk!).
B000FC2ROU|5.0|This is a review of the Kindle version of the English translation. I'll focus on the merits of the ebook itself. Unlike a lot of Kindle items, this book has a working table of contents complete with links to every chapter. It also has actual page numbers, which will undoubtedly help you if you're reading this book for a class or a reading group. This book is also blessedly free of all the major typos that render so many ebooks practically illegible. There are a couple very minor typos, sure, but nothing to worry about. Structurally, the layout is clear and sensible. A lot of ebooks aren't formatted for ereader use, but the publishers clearly put some effort into this one. Overall, this is one of the better Kindle products I have purchased. The story itself is fantastic, of course, and the fact that it is well-formatted for Kindle only makes it better.
034547581X|5.0|This book made the war in Vietnam present again, 45 years later. The best account I have ever read of a battle from the point of view of the men who fought it, backed up with some of the larger details that give context. Moore didn't say as much as he could have, but if you know a bit about the history of the Vietnam War you can fill in the gaps with what he does say. Many of the things the military does today are based on lessons learned from this battle, and others like it.<br /><br />One of the blurbers described this book as eye-stinging. I can't think of a better word for my emotional reaction. The citizen soldiers who fought at LZ X-Ray and LZ Albany displayed incredible courage and grit. I was struck by the difference between this book and books of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The military that fights in the sandbox today is very different than that of the Vietnam War. Many of today's shooters are professionals, career military men who provide structure to an all-volunteer force that is increasingly disengaged with wider society.<br /><br />Moore's men were a combination of conscripts and volunteers, but they were the best of citizen soldiers, non-professionals who shouldered a tough job for a short time in solidarity with their countrymen. One of the best parts of the book is Moore and Galloway's homage \\"Where have all the young men gone?\\". They tracked down as many of the men who fought at Ia Drang as possible, and told their stories after the battle. These were men from every walk of life, so the impact of their lives and deaths was diffused throughout society. This was the last great hurrah of the citizen soldier, and he fought damn well.

0316044695|4.0|Badass is the only way to describe Marcus Luttrell and his teammates. Everyone should know this about SEALs already, but reading this first-hand account will drive it home. Anyone who is familiar with the SEAL ethos and training methods could probably skim or skip the first half of the book. Luttrell needed to honor his comrades by describing what made them special, but there are no surprises here.<br /><br />However, what does become clear is just how effective the selection process is. Part of SEAL training is just that: training. Another part is weeding out those who do not have what it takes. And what it takes is an absolute refusal to quit. As Luttrell makes clear in his memories of BUD/S, the men who wash out are not necessarily weaker or slower than those who perservere, although some are. Those who remain are massively determined, even obstinant. They would rather die than quit, and in fact will remain alive on sheer willpower long after another man would lie down to die.<br /><br />Operation Redwing demonstrated this. The other three SEALs on the ground with Luttrell, Michael P. Murphy, Danny Dietz and Matthew Axelson continued to fight after being horrifically wounded when they were ambushed and enfiladed. Luttrell was saved by being blown off a cliff by an RPG, preventing his enemies from locating him.<br /><br />The last third of the book has an excellent description of the reality of village life in the Hindu Kush, and the kind of ancient rights and privileges that persist in that part of the world. Luttrell's life was saved by Lokhay Warkawa, which we might think of as sanctuary, granted by the headman of the village he stumbled into. Like the Clameur de Haro, it was impossible for the Taliban to ignore this protection. They did take the opportunity to abuse Luttrell further, but they could not take him as they wished.<br /><br />I would have liked to know what the results of the final debriefing of this mission were. This was clearly a monumental Charlie Foxtrot, especially the ill-fated rescue attempt that cost the lives of the rest of the SEALs at his base, including their commanding officer. The SEALs have a principle that no man is left behind, but I am certain they are hard enough on themselves to see the rescue attempt cost more lives than it should have.fated rescue attempt that cost the lives of the rest of the SEALs at his base, including their commanding officer.

B0015ABRE2|3.0|In its broad lines, Season 3 carries on the formulas that worked in the previous seasons, but there's a lot of treading water here. First of all, the main concept of the season is too reminiscent of Season 2: Dexter finds a kindred spririt. Except that this time, the confidant is a guy instead of a sexy girl. This raises the question: is Dexter a moron? Why does he bond with this guy after the betrayal of his trust last season? The writers also seem to have lost sight of the character's essential strangeness: Dexter seems to be a serial killer the way some people are stamp collectors. Despite some lip service to his \\"dark passenger\\", we see a guy in a pretty normal relationship (the weirdness of Rita in Season 1 is totally over), showing little sign of pathology other than some killing to \\"take out the trash\\". The clever conceits of Season 2 (Dex as superhero? Dex as subject of an investigation?) are not matched here (the hazy \\"investigation\\" of Quinn is pure filler); there's very little to distract from the tedious friendship storyline. Other minuses: Deb's new haircut is awful, it's still a mystery why she is considered a competent cop, and Jimmy Smits as Miguel Prado is convincing as a small-time politician (chummy, phony, pushy) but not particularly interesting as a character (impenetrable without being intriguing). Disappointing.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|Man this is seriously one of my favorite albums, Till has an amazing voice, and Kruspe, and Richard show off their musicianship in this album. The songs in this album, all of them are amazing, my personal favorites are Rammlied, Haifisch(Shark), Fruhling in Paris(Springtime in Paris), Waidmanns Heil(Hunters Greeting), Ich Tu Dir Weh(I Hurt You), and Mehr(More). I like all of the songs though in the end. And this band rocks live, I know I saw them in America, they are amazing live! Anyways though, this is must buy for all Rammstein fans. I don't recommened kids to buy this album, because it has Nudity on the cover, and in the booklet. But other then that, an amazing album! If you loved Herzeleid(Heartache) Reise, Reise, you'll love this!!!
B000V86OKG|5.0|Season 2 keeps up the Soprano-style tension between your affection for this lovable serial killer and the nagging voice of your conscience telling you there's something wrong about rooting for a compulsive murderer. For girl-watchers, there are now three (count 'em!) skinny, sexy girls involved in the proceedings, establishing a clear trademark look for the series (newcomer Lila is a bit phony at the onset, but begins to make more sense as time goes by). The black humor remains at a constant high, with plot twists galore to keep you on the edge of your seat. Michael C. Hall's understated acting would be enough to carry the show, but I have to admit Erik King as his nemesis, Sgt. Doakes, is my favorite character (despite an illogical trip to Haiti, what were you thinking, man?!!!). Good show.

0307595862|4.0|I will not try to compare \\"Snowman\\" with the works of Stieg Larsson, because I may be the only person in America (the Western World?) who has not read the \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" series. I will have to evaluate \\"Snowman\\" on its own merits and not as a comparison to other internationally acclaimed Norwegian mysteries (I never thought I would say that one!)<br /><br />It took me about 150 pages to really get into \\"Snowman\\" - I found the language overly rough and some of the scenes worthy of cheap dime-store smut (admittedly, the first 5 pages are the worst). At one point I was even tempted to put the book down and move onto the next book in my large stack of books to review. I am happy to say that not only did I finish \\"Snowman\\", by the end, I was staying up well past my bedtime because I wasn't able to put the book down. The second half of the book moved at a lightening clip, and while somewhat predictable, was completely satisfying.<br /><br />I will not bore you with a plot summary (the one provided by Amazon is much better than any that I could write) but I will say that for a murder mystery/who-done-it it does<br /><br />- Move pretty fast, especially the 2nd half of the book<br /><br />- The main character, Harry Hole is well developed. A flawed charter who is completely driven to catch bad guys.<br /><br />- Everything progresses in a logical fashion - nothing here to make you suspend belief in the story.<br /><br />- The ending is not a cop-out. Too many of these types of mysterious build such tension and then are unable to deliver... \\"Snowman\\" is not in that category.<br /><br />Final Verdict - I enjoyed the book, but I have a hard time giving it a full recommendation due to some of the smutty imagery and the coarse language. If you have no issues with these then I would say that it is nearly a must read for the Summer months.<br /><br />4 Stars
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|First, some of the comments here are about the DVD version and NOT the Blu-ray version, so they are irrelevant to the discussion about the Blu-ray version.    Second, on the discs I have seen, you have the option of viewing the original effects or the CGI effects. Therefore, it doesn't matter which you prefer, you can see the version you like.    Third, the MOST IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE of the Blu-ray version is that you will see, for the first time in your life, the series as Gene Roddenberry intended you to see it. The original series was shot on FILM. Yes, actual film like they used to use for movies when computers were room-sized. Blu-ray is the only format capable of displaying the full definition of the film stock (as geeky as many of us are, I'm sure someone will argue this, but when you can see film grain, that's enough definition). If you have seen the series only on television or DVD, you have never seen the original series as it was intended to be seen. Do yourself a favor, try the Blu-ray -- you can rent them from Blockbuster online even though Netflix doesn't have them for some reason >:-   or borrow them from your friend who has the giant media room in the basement. Better yet, tell him or her to let you watch them there! Much more fun watching with a friend, and bring along someone who's never seen them! ;-)

B0034G4P80|4.0|Among the Marvel Comics characters that have come to the silver screen, the biggest stretch to the imagination may be this elaborate 2011 fantasy adventure because the story is rooted in Norse mythology rather than technology and science fiction like [[ASIN:B001C08RHA Iron Man]] or [[ASIN:B00005JKCH Spider-Man]]. That's probably why producer Kevin Feige chose actor Kenneth Branagh to direct since his erudite touch, showcased in his numerous Shakespearean adaptations, is what the epic film needs to ground the more human elements into something more relatable to the audience. That's no small feat considering the amount of exposition needed at the beginning to give a brief history of Asgard where its king Odin has been waging war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim led by their malevolent king Laufey. Odin has raised two sons, Thor and Loki, opposites in disposition as the arrogant Thor prepares to ascend the throne while Loki seethes in jealousy. Thor's fate is interrupted when the Frost Giants attempt to seize the Casket of Ancient Winters.<br /><br />Seeking revenge, Thor recruits his band of warriors to enter battle in Jotunheim, an act of defiance which causes Odin to banish Thor to Earth where he becomes mortal without his all-powerful hammer Mjolnir, which is stuck in a rock in the middle of the New Mexican desert. There he meets scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig and their assistant Darcy, where the movie diverges into a fish-out-of-water tale, while back in Asgard, Loki learns of his true identity as the son of Laufey and consequently attempts to take over the throne as Odin lies in a deep sleep. There are plenty of battle sequences to tie the story together and keep the momentum going, including an impressive, darkly lit fight with the Frost Giants and a classic [[ASIN:B0016MLIKM High Noon]]-style confrontation with a nearly indestructible automaton. However, in the screenplay by Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne, what really makes the movie great fun is its sense of humor during the New Mexico scenes, certainly enough to offset the more austere, good-versus-evil drama occurring back in Asgard.<br /><br />Ideally fitting the imposing physical dimensions of the title role, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth plays the stalwart, uncomplicated hero with aplomb. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston brings out the villain's veiled smarminess with ease. In danger of overexposure by now (this is the fourth movie of hers I've seen in four months), Natalie Portman manages to make the most of a wafer-thin role as the plucky Jane as we are meant to believe she is a master astrophysicist. Her comic interplay with Kat Demmings, amusingly acidic as ever as Darcy, provides nice relief from the action. Anthony Hopkins isn't really challenged much by the role of Odin, but he brings his trademark authority nonetheless. Idris Elba is hardly recognizable as a stoic sentry, while Rene Russo is given little to do as Odin's wife Frigga. As Selvig, Stellan Skarsgård gets to play the unadventurous voice of reason on Earth, although he has an intriguing encounter with Samuel L. Jackson after the credits. All the production values and CGI effects are what you would expect from a $150 million film, and surprisingly, Branagh manages to tell the story in less time than \\"Bridesmaids\\".fun is its sense of humor during the New Mexico scenes, certainly enough to offset the more austere, good-versus-evil drama occurring back in Asgard.

B004SIP6QI|5.0|One of the Best Movies ever I absolutely love it. I watch it every few months and love it every time. Great movie though really.
0316056863|4.0|Other reviewers have called the book \\"uneven,\\" and there is some truth to that. For example, the early chapters about her father and her teen years spent in local theater jump off the page with details that delight and amaze (as a teen, her two best friends were lesbians in their 20s). In the 'work' chapters about her years with Second City, SNL, and 30 Rock, she seems a bit awestruck by some of these people (mainly Lorne Michaels and Alec Baldwin), so much that she seems to really put herself in the back seat in regard to her own talent, which is considerable. Yeah, Alec and Lorne are good, but when's the last time they wrote anything? The most vivid section of her work history is her depiction of how 30 Rock was written early on-the writers gather at her apartment, her baby is in bed, and her husband is somewhere in the kitchen writing 30 Rock's music, and Fey and the writers write into the sunrise.<br />  I say that she continues the tradition of Bombeck and Kerr because, like those pioneers, she weaves family and work into really funny pieces...however, those writers downplayed their work and highlighted their family hijinks, while Tina doesn't give her worklife the short shrift.<br />  I read it in two nights, and went back the next day and re-read the funny parts...I think, overall, it's a very funny and thoughtful memoir.

0743454537|3.0|If it weren't for the lousy ending I would have given this book four stars. Jodi Picoult is a great story teller and knows how to keep her reader coming back for more. This book gives us a lot to think about: medical ethics, family responsibility, genetics. I hated Sara, though, I just can't fathom a mother favoring one child over the others, although I suppose there are plenty of people like her in the world.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|I can't even tell you how many times I've seen Taxi Driver since I first watched it about 23 years ago on a pan & scan VHS copy. I've since owned 2 different dvd editions and seen it on broadcast TV.     Watching this blu-ray is litterally like watching the film for the first time. Outstanding job Sony.
0753801728|3.0|This book is giving me a lot to think about. There are so many levels: Michael and Hanna's relationship (as the mother of a teenage son, I do NOT approve), WWII and the Nazis, and philosophical thoughts on human nature. Originally written in German, I found some parts awkwardly worded and wonder if it's a translation problem. Short book, read it in 2 days.

This is the first book ever that has got me literally LOLing to a point where people were like, \\"what is wrong with her?\\"     I ordered the book a week ago and I havn't put it down since. It's packed with stories of her parents, her life as a child, her one-sided relationship with men, her SNL career, 30 ROCK, etc. It's great! Some of the jokes were a little \\"trying too hard\\" but they did not overshadow the funny parts.
0553584537|2.0|A pretty dumb book. I took it as an insult against survivors of child molestation; are we really to believe that Catherine would wind up evil because of her past? How many times did the author have to say the girl who climbed out of the hole was not the same girl who went in the hole...beat us over the head with it why don't you?  And I honestly don't believe a judge could have THAT much power...and throwing in the incest story? Creepy and unnecessary.  Also, why have Bobby break up with his girlfriend? What was the purpose of having her in the book then?  I gave it an extra half star because it was an easy read, but other than that don't waste your time unless you like entirely unbelievable murder mysteries.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I wasn't drawn to the aesthetics of this knife when I first started to search for the ideal outdoor knife. In fact, I initially had buyer's remorse thinking maybe I could have had an SOG Seal Pup Elite, or Gerber LMF 2--both solid blades from what I'd read, and more aesthetically pleasing IMHO. But once I lifted the raw heft of its 1095 steel cro-van weight, grasped its solid grivory grip, and unsheathed and swung its mighty 5.5\\" blade, I knew I'd made the right choice.    PROS:  The BK2 came razor-sharp out of the box and fits the included form-fitting Kydex sheath like a glove (I have medium-large sized hands). Swinging this thing around feels like it can chop a 3-inch branch with 2 swings. The all-black subdued design adds to its functionality as a low-profile tool. The weight balance is well-distributed, letting you swing the blade like an axe while piercing like a spear. The Kydex sheath is very well-built and assuredly holds the blade in place upside-down--perfect for holstering on a MOLLE-capable vest or pack.    CONS:  The sheath is initially quite tight when inserting or removing the blade but it should loosen in time. Heavy metal and a large handle means its not for those with dainty hands or a weak grip. And because it's slow, it's not a good fighter (unlike the Seal Pups or LMF 2s)--but that's not what it was designed for--this blade was meant to cut and last through a war.    BOTTOM LINE:  The Ka-Bar BK2 truly lives up to its reputation and combines excellent materials in a well-built knife. I don't hesitate to recommend the BK2 as an excellent choice in a superior hunting / camping / survival knife that will stay by my side for years to come.

Who does that anymore? I wondered if the author was trying too hard for Literature and whether it was going to be  awkward. But shortly after that, I was hooked. These books are like crack. I only wish I had waited to begin the story until all three were published. I hope I don't have to wait two years to find out what happens next. Mr. Rothfuss, if you're reading this, as a fellow Firefly fan, pretty please? Release the next book?
0767821629|5.0|THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR is one of several mind-benders that play around w/ the concept of what constitutes reality. If you enjoy movies like DARK CITY, EXISTENZ, or THE MATRIX, then 13F will fit right into your collection. I actually like it better than the others, and here's why: 1- No kung fu-on-wires-fighting. 2- It has a complete storyline that doesn't depend totally on CGI. 3- No Keanu Reeves! The way in which the interlocking dimensions of the story are revealed is smooth and the characters are interesting. Highly recommended...
B004FOA84A|4.0|Loved it.  You've played a game like this at some point, if not try it out. It's a bit of little puzzles,  bit of memorization of clues,  and a lot of tapping the screen.
B00503BN1M|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first with these two but I absolutely loved it, it was adorable. I'm a complete sap for movies like this!
0375500901|5.0|Love the Allon character created by Silva, the obvious research he's done, and the \\"between the lines\\" education of real world international affairs this \\"novel\\" provides.
0071752854|5.0|Every single page of the book contains valuable knowledges. I have never read a book like this. Just amazed ! I am lucky that I saw and pickup this book in bookstore and didnt put it back.    It can be seen that Oren have had a long hard work that combined his working experiences, knowledges and intelligences into a single book. Just curious that how Oren can achieve this. Did he have the neuroscience background before his investment career, or he gain those knowledge while working side by side ?   And how he combine them together intelligently ? This should be an interesting topic in knowledge theory.    As owner of a IT startup company, I found the \\"Three marketing forces and evolution\\" analysis of the pitching idea particularly useful. Oren use the term \\"Triangularization\\" to cross check your pitching idea by the three market forces. This serves not only for pitching, but also to check whether your idea is worth to carry on and has its own values to the world. This will help me a lot in fund rasing from VC later !    I think Oren should later repack/reframe the book in another title, like \\"Theory of selling\\", coz it really a classic, and is a unified and systematic framework/methodology for the subject.
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|I ordered this device since I'm tired of buying and throwing away batteries.  If Apple would make the Magic Mouse with a wire I would've bought that.  Anyway, nothing on the charger's box says to turn the mouse off before charging; thankfully I looked at the downloadable manual for that.  Plugged it into the wall first as I am out of USB ports and... nothing.  Tried different outlets, tried a couple USB ports.  I had to wiggle the cable around for a while to get the thing to light up red.<br /><br />After the mouse finally charged, at first my iMac would not recognize it at all.  After trying a couple things the mouse finally worked again... but no gesture support.  As I was searching Google for what might cause that, the Bluetooth connection started to intermittently drop and connect, before dropping again for good.  I placed everything back in the box and setup an RMA with Amazon.  It looks like I'll go with rechargeable batteries which I probably should've done in the first place.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I Love me some Sade, always have.  I wanted to see her in concert so bad and discover the ticket price is out of my price range, so what did I do, bought her lastest CD and just listen to that. Shes beautiful and very talented.  So, if you like jazz and blues, this is the CD to purchase.
0307887960|2.0|I nabbed this because I had heard about it through a French friend a few years ago and I was curious to see if it was all that it is cracked up to be. It isn't. The Dukan Diet is basically the French answer to Atkins with a little bit of fiber thrown in. It isn't a diet I can imagine anyone sustaining for long and, while it may work to trim down a few pounds, it isn't something that I would recommend to anyone. The Dukan Diet recommends artificial sweeteners and soy, both of which are concerning to me for health and environmental reasons.<br /><br />In addition to this, there are several instances of dubious \\"science.\\" For instance, Dukan recommends drinking lots of water or else you won't flush out all of the fat cells that you will be losing. You don't need to be a doctor to know that you don't \\"lose\\" fat cells, you shrink them. They never go away (unless you suck them out).<br /><br />Overall, the restrictiveness of the diet tells me that it isn't something that is going to work for most people out there. This seems more like one of those fad diets that will get you a few pounds lighter, only to have you gain it back when you try to eat normal again.<br /><br />Sure, you will probably drop a few pounds on this diet, but so would you on the cabbage diet, the grapefruit diet, the skinny bitch diet or any other diet that restricts your food options. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a healthy and sustainable weight loss.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Got this movie on the recommendation of a friend, and wow, it is VERY impressive!  If you want a true epic movie that deals with the conflicts in Alexandia toward the end of the Roman empire, look no further.  The movie is beautifully filmed, the sets and cinematography are outstanding, and the acting is top drawer.  This is a graphic portrayal of the rise of Christianity and the Catholic church and the downfall of all other civilizations in the middle east, so I can see where the church wouldn't openly embrace this film, but, facts are facts.  The early Christian movement, once it gained the backing of Rome, did become quite violent after having been surpressed for centuries and that is evident in this movie.  This is disturbing at times, but it is a fantastic movie and I highly recommend this one.
B001GRY5Q6|4.0|Boxset is great, fanpack items look awesome. The movie is nice and the extras are very cool. The only downside, I like better the VHS edition, audio editing for the DVD and Blu-ray editions sound much worst than origina VHS audio in my opinion...
6305076995|4.0|Yessongs  DVD Menu    Your Move  I've Seen All Good People  The Clap  And You and I  Close to the Edge  Excerpts from the Six Wives of Henry VIII  Roundabout  Yours Is No Disgrace      I am giving Yessongs the dvd four stars simply because it captures an awesome band playing in an awesome way. Everything you need to fully appreciate just how GREAT YES was in the early 70's is captured here. I am a mere  novice fan compared to many who have commented here, and who will comment, so keep that in mind. That being said I thought the dvd was pretty great. I basically knew every song, and the setlist is a \\"greatest hits\\" sort of setlist too. Most fans of YES will know the songs. As for the visuals the film quality was pretty good overall. However, anyone can clearly see how the concert was simply SLAPPED ONTO DVD FROM A VIDEO SOURCE. There is absolutely NO remastering of any kind. Near the end of the show I could see lines on the screen from I guess where the video source was scratched. And there are all kinds of video anomalies that anyone would see in an old vhs movie, or any dvd that was never remastered. Still, with all of this being known, the stage was well lighted and very band member was easily recognizable. The image is NOT blurry or fuzzy, and the closeups are good. It is true though that often when someone was playing a solo the camera was not on them. Here I am thinking of Chris Squire on bass, not enough closeups of him playing bass solos. Also, I don't really remember many closeups of Alan White the drummer. As for Rick Wakeman mostly the camera came up to him from behind or from the side. We don't see Rick right in front of us often if ever. Mostly all of the good closeups are on Steve Howe on guitar and Jon Anderson on vocals. The audio is what I had the biggest problem with. The audio isn't so bad, but it seems that it was dubbed on to the film and it doesn't quite match the band and the singer as they play. The sound is synched up closely, but it's nota match. It often seemed like the band was lip synching to a soundtrack. Obviously they were jamming and playing incredibly, but this is what I think is the biggest flaw of the dvd. The other thing that pissed me off was how the dvd case was one of those new cheapos that is mostly hollow and missing plastic. And the disc is a simple silver affair without color. There is no track listing on the dvd insert or on the disc. It does smack of someone making an easy buck. Also, at the end of this concert film we see the movie as being rated G. Wow, straight from a movie theater piece of stock footage to a dvd.       Anyway, this is a great band at their peak playing great rock and roll. Forget about what this disc is not and focus on the MUSIC. The MUSIC is what this dvd is suppossed to be about. Yes, the limitations of the dvd are a real pisser, but this concert is just shy of being 40 years old now. The band now has a replacement singer. Time marches on. Don't let the quality of this dvd keep you from enjoying a truely fantastic band who was caught peaking in their craft.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i just updated it last week and already beat the level! all three stars and all volleyballs (or watermelons i cant tell) ok, ready for the new update now! lol
B001UV4XHY|2.0|As the books get progressively longer the movies started to leave more and more out of the films (understandable the first book is so short compared to the later ones).  I love Harry Potter, have all the books and extras and movies up until this one.  This is one I felt the flow of the movie was slow and dull.  Sure, we watch it because we love the books and characters and yes I will see part II for the same reason, but this movie is not well done.  I often wanted to give a pat on the fast forward to speed things up when normally I want to slow the movie down and make it last longer.  Even though the movie is week, it doesn't diminish the quality of the books and story.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Suzanne Collins can create a scary and believable pseudo-future. She can't create likable heroines.    The problem is that too often Katniss gives the impression of being barely functional on anything beyond a biological level. Yes, okay, we get it; a lifetime of being forced to play the structural pillars for her family after her father's death have basically left her more than a little socially handicapped since she doesn't spare a lot of thought for much beyond taking care of her mother and sister. But at this point in the trilogy, she's still misunderstanding the intentions of her friends and the people she meets because OH HAI IM KATNISS I DON'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S MINDS I MISJUDGE EVERYONE LOL and it's getting really old. She keeps saying \\"What could he have meant by that?\\", and when the answer is painfully obvious it makes me wonder if she didn't sustain a whole bunch of head injuries that had to be edited out of the original book.    It makes the predictable love triangle that springs up early on in the book even more painful to witness. Peeta's a nice guy, but that's basically his sole characterisation (oh, and I guess he likes to paint? WHAT A KEEPER.), and there's so little chemistry between he and Katniss that it makes his love for her seem silly and wafer thin. He says things like, \\"You're the only thing I have to live for,\\" and \\"You're so amazing,\\" which I suppose is romantic if you're an emotionally repressed teenage girl but doesn't really do a whole lot to provide a believable sense of passion and emotion between these two characters. At least Gale shares common interests and personality traits with Katniss, even if he should probably have BROODING HERO FOR HIRE(TM) tattooed across his forehead. Maybe they could go off in the forest and be boring together. Aw!    The other, bigger problem tied to that is Katniss is an awful, awful narrator and her complete lack of passion in her delivery fails to engage you on any sort of emotional level. There's ascene midway through the book where she flees somewhere upon having a predictable bit of bad news dropped on her and starts screaming uncontrollably. Her emotions, related in her flat, deadpan delivery even when describing something that should be gutwrenching, cheapen the scenes that are meant to be powerful and instead leave me disinterested and disassociated from what's going on. And frankly for me personally that's too big an arrow through the heart of the book to ignore; if I could care less about the protagonist (and in fact just plain don't like her) then no amount of clever worldbuilding can save a story.    Several times while reading the book I had to remark aloud, \\"Seriously?\\" and \\"This is stupid\\" and \\"But SERIOUSLY?\\" I admit I wound up skimming the last seventy pages or so. I just didn't care about any of it, and the few interesting concepts or characters introduced can't breathe alongside Katniss' unbearable navel-gazing. To be honest, I don't know if a different protagonist would have saved this one for me; Ms Collins' writing style is just too dry and tasteless for me to really get into. She has a lot of interesting concepts and clearly a very clever imagination, but her method of delivery doesn't feel like it's suited for a story that's trying so hard to connect with you emotionally and just fails on so many levels. We have the third book here (I bought them in a trio, and my husband pronounces them \\"... alright\\" after a heavy pause) and I'm not sure if I'll wind up reading it.     TL;DR: If you liked the first book, there's no guarantee you'll like this one, so heavily laden with trite teen romance triangles and it's phenomenally bland heroine that it doesn't spend the time it needs to on plot and more substantial character development.
0060775858|5.0|This book is a most wonderful classic.  My children loved it, and now I am giving it to my grandchildren.
0205632645|5.0|Makes you stop and think about what you are REALLY saying.  Can't read more than one or two page at a time because you have to stop and think about what it says and how you used to say it.  I recommend it--not sure why it took me so long to get it!
B004LL1HM4|5.0|I am a hip hop fan to the core. I always have been, and whenever I rarely step out of that realm its usually to check out some heavy metal. I listened to the titular single \\"Helplessness Blues\\" back in February on a whim... and something stuck with me. It was not the best song I had ever heard, but it was wonderfully composed and had a unique feel to it. I forgot about the album until the day of its release, where it was at a discounted price. I took the plunge, and went through the first half of the album unfazed. I just did not get it. Then, all of a sudden during \\"Lorelai,\\" something inside me clicked and I was overcome with emotion.     I have listened to it from top to bottom about 5 times and the passion, the \\"oomph\\" that is on these tracks is so heavy, whether it be the lyrical content or just the gorgeous instrumentation. Even one of the lighter tracks, \\"Blue Spotted Tail,\\" packs quite a whollop in its existential musings about Earth. This album is fun, it is thoughtful, it is human.    I urge you to look past the \\"indie\\" feel of this album and give it at least two listens through. It is worth every penny.
0385523912|5.0|This is a totally absorbing, yet chilling picture of life under a totalitarian dictatorship. The sad part is that life hasn't changed much for those unluckily fated with being born in North Korea. Several years ago I visited Cuba with a religious group. Although the Cuban people have better weather, and longer growing seasons, their lives are also controlled by the state. Both countries have people who risk everything to live in freedom. Visiting Cuba, and reading Barbara Demick's excellent portrayal of how six ordinary people managed to survive years of deprivation and cruelty in North Korea made me thankful to be an American.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|A series that has grown on me, this is probably Nesbo's best book yet. If I ever do a top ten Nordic writers list, Nesbo will be in there. Promise! For the time being, the list remains:<br /><br />1. To Kill a Mocking Bird - Harper Lee. 2. Past Imperfect - John Matthews. 3. Mystic River - Dennis Lehane. 4. Presumed Innocent - Scott Turow. 5. The Client - John Grisham. 6. Tell No One - Harlan Coben. 7. Silence of the Lambs - Thomas Harris. 8. The Emperor of Ocean Park - Stephen L. Carter. 9. No Time for Goodbye - Linwood Barclay. 10. The Poet - Michael Connelly.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Very vivid portrayal of lives cindered by addiction and the crippling aftermath of it's effect. Visceral, intense, not for the faint of facing the sad underside of life. Ellen Burstyn's performance was the best I have ever seen concerning the subject matter, her story is particulary tragic since she simply was chasing the imagined perception of escaping loneliness via a false promise to recapture her youth.Jared Leto's portayal of empty and wasted youth was sorrowfully stated, as was his girlfriend's (Jennifer Connelly) and his pal (Marlon Wayans).  Not an uplifting feel good movie to put it mildy. However, within the context of it's downward spiral of a story lies a powerful message.
B002ZG99QS|2.0|I purchased this for my 10 year old son because he liked the concept of \\"going into the game.\\" While the cinematography was good, the story line did not hold the attention of my son, myself or my sci-fi loving husband. My daughter's comment was that is was a \\"sad story.\\" Not impressed.
0470913029|5.0|If you are looking for the ideal life changing anti inflammatory nutritional guide, this is the book for you.  It is an easy read and very well organized to help you along the way.  It just makes sense!
B004S699HC|3.0|Like previous reviews, no extras, very basic menu. The Transfer is actually pretty good. Some of the flaws are noticeable such as specs of dust etc on the film, but nothing really bad. Just expect at least toss in a couple of extras such as the film's trailer, maybe some of the on set interviews that were available on the DvD. So yeah nice to see this unappreciated movie in HD, but yeah.
0439023513|1.0|I am so disappointed with this book.  I understand that there is a message here about the realities of war, but I wasn't looking for a lesson. The components that I loved in the first two (Katniss's  loyalty and courage, Peeta's love, the hope for a better future) slowly die out until there's nothing left. It was as if its second half was written by an entirely different person than the first.   The epilogue- a depressing version of what I'd hoped to see- was too little, too late. By then, the characters were people I didn't know, in a book I just wanted to end. I wish I'd skipped the second half and read the last page, like I was tempted to do. This is my advice, if you must read it.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|No more noisy fan when 3.8ghz phenom quadC. Cool and with thermal paste, I suggest dont buy artic silver it does'nt make any difference, just use the stock paste, make sure you just put a very thin layer, just to fill the gaps from the metal to metal contact between cpu and cooler, that's the key, you prevent not to make the metal ro metal contact between the cpu and cooler.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|A true video game come to life, \\"Sucker Punch\\" is as if filmmaker Zack Snyder put trace elements of [[ASIN:B000EOTAM6 Aeon Flux (Special Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000095J2Z Versus (Director's Cut)]], [[ASIN:0790729997 Mortal Kombat]], [[ASIN:B00006JDVV Reign of Fire]], [[ASIN:B001GCUO5M Shutter Island]], and [[ASIN:B00005QZ7U Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] all into a blender, and came up with this whopper of a genre-twisting film! Browning (who hardly has any lines), Cornish, and Malone are all great with good support from Hudgens, Chung and Gugino. But the person who steals the show as the guy you love to hate is Oscar Isaac playing Blue. What a scumbag bas#@*&. Anyways, Glenn and Hamm make OK cameos, and the film has a great pacing to it. Even though the ending attempts to give a great message (which it does in its monologue), it still seems a bit lackluster compared to the previous 1 hour and 50 minutes the viewer just sat through -- what with all of the amazing fights, music (the soundtrack, [[ASIN:B004KD5TQI Sucker Punch]], rocks!) and special effects. Nevertheless, these ladies kick butt and their adventure makes for one hell of a ride!
B003L20ICE|1.0|No one can fault the acting in this film.  I generally like Annette Bening in her roles until this one.  She is mentally, emotionally and physically repulsive.  Her character is so vile as to cause actual nausea.  The children are spoiled brats, and the spouse (moore) is spineless.  This is just a lame story about a weak minded individual.  So terrified she is of losing anyone due to her lack of substance, she is a tyranical hun. Don't waste your time.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I have virtually no words that can describe how beautiful this compilation of music is.  The movie in and of itself was a great piece of theatrical work, and to listen to the score just makes it all the more incredible.  The music in this album has an amazing balance of suspense, tear-jerking, terror, and awe.  From the beginning you want to hit repeat over and over again on your stereo control.      I listen to a wide variety of music, from classical to rock, and techno electronica to alternative, and this by far has quickly become one of my most valued, most played, and most adorned compilations of music.      I by FAR recommend this album to anyone who enjoys beautiful music, or anyone looking for something to be a complete ease and relaxation with.    Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer deserve a medal.
B00368PSN2|3.0|I'll keep this short. The acting is pretty bad. The predictability of the storyline is horribly high. There are some CGI effects and scenes (mostly involving the creature in the movie) that help save this from being a flop but not enough to make it worth buying on Blu-Ray. The trailer made me think it was a good buy but it really isn't. Buy the streaming version before you decide to drop coin on this flick.    If you still want the blu-ray let me know and I'll mail it to you.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for star wars saga to come out on blu ray!! I do wish it had the old school versions on them.  Also it seems everytime  star wars is released on a new form of media they change the special effects.  I wish they would take there time on this and enhance the effects for the better.  The jabba palace song blows in the new versions!!!  The songs in general in star wars sucks. Not the john williams songs!!!   Also the one thing that wish they would add is Darth Vader killing Jar jar!!!!  That would be worth everypenny.  I think this movie set would have 5 stars on every review!!!
B001ILFUDM|5.0|I used to watch this growing up and now my kids are watching and enjoying it. The quality is like most new blu-rays and dvd's. Ill be watching this countless times with my kids. As long as you, the buyer gets a good deal I would get the DVD+Blu-ray combo; most portable dvd player and the one in your car aren't Blu-Ray yet.
B0012BV9FG|5.0|Our 4 year old doesn't think it's so bad, either.<br /><br />We're huge Schleich fans at our house.  With our three boys, toys need to be pretty hearty to last, and dinosaurs... well they need to be almost invulnerable to anything.  (Today our 2-year-old bit the head off a cheaper rubber dinosaur.  Yes, it's crazy here.)<br /><br />This thing is huge, so cool to see it tower over the other animals and dinos they play with.  I love the attention to scale and detail in the toy.  Let's face it, the wonder of dinosaurs to children is based heavily on how terrifyingly massive they were.  This bad boy is great.  A favorite.<br /><br />Buy the way, it even defeats Spiderman every time at our house.  That's some serious deference in our abode, let me tell you.<br /><br />The catch... remember, this toy is big and heavy.  If you're the type that's gonna worry endlessly about their precious little one dropping it on their toes or using it as a weapon against a little sister, it could do some damage.  But so can a baseball, so what the hell.
B004G6009U|4.0|My kids where more exited about the idea of the movie then before they watched it. After watching it they haven't asked to see it again. If you have a portable player, in your car or on your lap make sure you get the DVD- Blu-Ray combo.
B003UESJH4|4.0|We purchased a [[ASIN:B00392147E Panasonic TC-P54G25 54-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV]] last summer and have it hooked up to an older OPPO player. We stream most of our movies nowadays, but the handful of older DVDs we have generally look fine with this combo.<br /><br />While I LOVE this movie (easily 5 star) the quality of this DVD was HORRID (1star) on this television. And I don't mean a little bad, but really terrible.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this was the case and if it's a known issue of some sort then it should be noted on the product page and/or packaging.<br /><br />As for the movie itself: superb acting, great actor dynamics, well told story from the dialog to clothing to the wall paper to the children's toys.<br /><br />Not sure if the DVD manufacturer assumes most people who view this movie don't have more 'advanced' types of TV, but when 3D TVs are all the rage of the day (making our Plasma screen border on old fashioned) they should take that into consideration if they would like to continue selling physical discs.

159420229X|4.0|Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer was not what I had expected.  I anticipated a self-help<br />on memory, but instead I went on an adventure of the mind and how memory works.  In plain speech,<br />Joshua was able to take the complexities of the science of brain function and memory and explain<br />the theories in such away that anyone could understand with out talking down to the reader.<br /><br />Using science, true stories, and Joshua's own experiences, Joshua is able to present the history<br />of learning and memory theory in an easy to understand and entertaining manner.  Toward the beginning<br />of the book, he discusses his first memory task.  A strange shopping list from his friend Ed.  I can still<br />easily remember everything on that list and the number 1207194109112001 forward and backward.<br /><br />I learned about Mental Athletes, this strange memory competition, and Joshua's own adventure<br />going from reporter of an event to national champion in a single year.  I myself went from being<br />skeptical of memory tricks to having a greater appreciation for the mind and brain, and having<br />a desire to improve my own memory.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this book.
0307454541|4.0|I don't want to write too much about the plot here but I'll say this much: give it about 150 pages.  The first hundred pages are a little slow and it's hard to see how it all comes together.  The central story doesn't really start until Mikael meets Henrik, so hang in until those two start talking and I think you'll enjoy the book a great deal.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I am re-reading this story for the umpteenth time.  I heard a rumor that they are or were making it into a movie.  Would be a good one...
B004OEIL54|4.0|The film itself looks fine but not spectacular on Blu-ray.<br /><br />It is presented in enhanced widescreen, which is nice for those like me who haven't seen it that way yet.<br /><br />The bonus contents listing brags of a behind-the-scenes featurette and some other similar footage.  Each of those runs a scant 3-7 minutes.  Not much to get excited about.  I am about midway through watching it with the Director and Writer commentary track.  It is interesting but not compelling.<br /><br />At this writing, Amazon is offering this Blu-ray at a substantially discounted price.  It is probably worth the purchase at this price but I wouldn't pay regular price for this if I were you and already owned the DVD.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|You know, I bought one of these a while ago, and it didn't work, so I gave it a bad review.  About a week later I received a new one in the mail (I didn't ask for one), and that one worked!  So, kudos to the supplier of these devices.  My new one works like it is supposed to.  Good job!
081297381X|2.0|I will be brief since there are already 500+ reviews.  Presumably you already know what this is about - how distributions are often fat-tailed compared with Gaussians, and how this results in failures in a lot of commonly used models.  It's a good point. It's an important point.  But the importance of the point doesn't make it worth having to slog through 450 pages of Taleb's condescending pseudo-intellectual ramblings.  Taleb has written about this same topic in 'Fooled by Randomness', which I do recommend.  I see little reason to indulge this longer, poorly written, vanity project.
B00005JLR2|5.0|I bought this movie for my Son when he was 6 yrs old. He's almost 8 now and I can't tell you how many times we've watched this movie!! It's such a great film - funny, captivating, heart warming - it has everything! I highly recommend this movie for all kids. :)
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Just received this item in the mail today and first impression is very underwhelming.    The sound is pretty quiet and doesn't resemble the sound from the TV show very well.  You have to use your imagination.  I suppose this is good if your kids are going to be using it all the time, but it does greatly weaken the coolness factor when you are showing it off to your friends.    The light is also on the dim side.  This may be a limitation of a UV light, but a bright blue light would be a lot more impressive, and the novelty of invisible ink (for which you need a UV light) wears off pretty quickly.    As others have noted, it is plastic and not so durable.    If you love the Dr. Who TV show it is still a fun purchase, but it could be so much better...
030745455X|3.0|Reading the second book of the series and hearing so many positive reviews, I was dumfounded by this new scenario.<br /><br />The plot and characters continued to get more and more contrived as the book got further on.<br /><br />I found that I could not believe or fathom the actual outcome, nor did I seem to care.<br /><br />Having read the first book and given it four full stars, it disappointed me greatly that it was not the same caliber.<br /><br />I will go on to the third book and perhaps it will all fall in place and my review of this book might merit an edit.
B004G6009K|5.0|Besides it being a fantastic movie that is easily one of my favorites now, I got it for a smoking deal of half the price they were selling it in stores and! It came on my front porch sooner than a week! Brilliant timing and packaging. All new and shiny. Thank you! :)
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I wanted to wait to the end of the season to review the show. I mean, that seems only fair.  That being said, Hawaii Five - O rocks!!  I was a fan of the Jack Lord Hawaii Five-O, and wasn't sure what to expect, I'm glad I gave it a chance.<br /><br />First, it's not fair to compare it to the old show, it's not the old show, but it's just as good. This works on so many levels.<br /><br />The characters/casting are awesome.  O'Loughlin does a nice job as McGarrett.  It's not over the top, and he's making McGarrett his own.  Scott Caan is wonderful as Danno.  The chem. between Cann and O'Loughlin is a nice touch. It would have been to easy to have the two of them being buddy buddy all the time.  They're the opposite ends of the same coin.  They play off each other nicely. Kim does a nice job as Kelly.  It was a risk to have Kono as a woman, but Park does a nice job of it. I also like how she can kick butt.  All four of them play off each other nicely.  I also love Taylor Wily as Kamekona. I also love Mark Dacascos as Wu Fat.  I love how they give small nods to the old show. For fans of the old show, the guy who plays Duke is the son of Kam Fong, who played the original Chin Ho Kelly.A very nice touch.<br /><br />The writing and scripts are awesome.  There is just one small flaw to it. One of the eppys this season was one of the original stories from the original 5-O, but it's not a big deal.  The cliffhanger was awesome!<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this. If you can catch this on repeats this summer, I highly suggest it.  When it comes to DVD, I'll be the first in line to get it.<br /><br />Aloha!

0470876417|5.0|As a designer who is interested in structuring his own business this was one of the most relevant handbooks that I've came across. It briefly explains important points, plus easy to remember because it is graphical. (Very good graphic layout/design too) All and all, a very nice read.
1601252463|5.0|If you want more spells, great character classes and prestige class, then this is the right book. Like most rulebooks written for Pathfinder, Advanced Player's Guide will certainly help you and your players in your campaings.  There are some useful chacracter classes like the Witch and the prestige classes are not those strange and  useless things found in many D&D 3.5 books.
B000002JSP|5.0|What is not to love of the greatest band of all time, beyond unique and talented. Jimmy Page best guitarist of all time and Robert Plant best singer of all time. What else can be said?
1601251505|5.0|This is the new D&D! Pathfinder is the right book if you want new campaings. The rules are great and the classes are more balanced. They even have different rules for each classes, like the bloodlines for the sorcerers. And now the player have the advantage. DM, beware! Your mosnters will suffer!
0316069353|1.0|It is ridiculous that this is the case. I think it is a good idea to give a bad review for an overpriced book, but a better boycott is to buy the hardcover when it comes down in price then resell on Amazon.  In that way the publisher is making half the profit, not selling as many books and a point is being made.  Probably a better idea would be to use the library that way they get no credit.  Very disappointed in some of my favorite authors for allowing this to happen.
B003DZ6BYI|5.0|The album is very nice. They had chaged the style of the band and one more time it looks great! Pain Of Salvation is really a real good band, makes me sad to know they aren't so famous!
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Avoid this thinly plotted drivel at all costs. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot seemed to be made up as the movie went along, and the \\"action\\" scenes were poor copies of better sequences. It made the second Transformers look like Hamlet in comparison. The visuals were pretty darn good, but as anyone who saw Star Wars episode III knows, great visuals just can't carry a movie. I couldn't wait to escape from the theater. Save yourself the misery of this watching this audio/visual brain melter.
B00122Z9DS|5.0|Pure,clear and perfect is what I use to best describe this album or cd -or download. Make your choice! First pure-is the direction the band is going in following their prog. rock direction. They wanted to go the way of the new direction of the more modern day sound. And they found it with their new producer.He hath shown them the way to their best cd since Moving Pictures!! Which brings me to my second point in clear! Clear-is the sound. They have never had a mastering of a whole cd sound done better than this one. Thanks to Alex Lifeson(Guitars) and master of the magic wand Rich Chycki.And finally-perfect in their song writing,arrangement,sound and blend of numerous instruments used in this cd! A standing ovation from this long awaited fan to see his favorite bands reach their perfection. NOW STAY THERE!!!!
B004OR1X6A|5.0|Two more great albums from Rory Gallagher. The lost studio album contains excellent alternative versions of songs from his 'Photo Finish' album and elsewhere. At first listen to the studio album, the songs sound strangely different from the versions many of us have heard a hundred times over. My first intuition was that Rory sounds slightly restrained in the sense that he was being led along by a producer rather than just letting the music flow through him. The end product is a good one though and I will be listening to this disc a lot. Top notch playing througout and my personal favorites are \\"Rue the Day\\", \\"Mississippi Sheiks\\" with the electric violin at the end and the bonus track \\"Out on the Tiles\\"    The live album is a smoker - Rory holds nothing back here. The solo at the end of \\"Tattoo'd Lady\\" is three minutes of mind boggling, all out Rory Gallagher guitar bliss. Another treat is a great version of \\"Bullfrog Blues\\". Very good sound quality for a 1979 live album and I'd rate the CD on  par with the excellent live material from 'Live at Rockpalast' done during that period. Highly recommended!
B002VH7P4O|5.0|What an idiot -- I never checked the details of this until recently and discovered the flac files are 24bit resolution at 44.1kHz sampling rate, which is better than the 16 bit resolution of the CDs. So I promptly ordered it and am now a pleased owner. Some of the previous comments about broken stalks had me worried -- mine arrived intact and I will exercise due caution.    Someone else commented that you can't copy the video files to your hard drive. I found this to be untrue. The .flv flash videos copy without a problem (I use the VLC player to play them -- but note the files on the USB stick do not have the .flv file extension, you may want to add it). The .swf files which display album covers and such easily play in my browser (internet explorer). Actually, the entire contents can be copied and backed up.    One negative note: I found it necessary to redo all the tags for the flac and mp3 files and rename the files and directories to my liking, and also to redo the album art tags. The art used is of the new CD releases with the banner down the left side. Since the original artwork is provided, I simply made screen shots and resized them.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|i got this directly from the android market.  its really not for creating documents.  the powerpoint editor is practically useless when it comes to creating new presentations-you can make bulleted lists, one per slide, and not much else.  The doc editor is better.  It's a no frills editor, but it lets you do basic formatting well neough that you could actually use it to write a paper.  after reading reviews and seeing this in a few \\"best of\\" lists, I was expect more though.  Hopefully with more Android tablets coming on the market, they'll start making the program more robust, since the big tablets are geared more towards content creation.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I am speechless on how amazing this book is. I had a great time reading it and I reccomend it for people around 7- adult. If I was stranded on an island with one book; it would be The Lost Hero!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This movie is an amazing journey.  It has everything to make you laugh, cry and want to help them fight.  Very very good.
630471193X|5.0|My favorite film of all time.<br />It contains the best performances of John Travolta, Kyra Sedgewick, and Robert Duvall.<br />The scene in the hospital with all three makes me teary every time I see it.<br />It is clean (no sex or profanity) and a wonder to behold.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I just received my Perplexus Epic after months of anticipation and I am absolutely blown away!  Perplexus Original is a big hit in our family and after mastering it, I couldn't wait to see how many hours of my life would be \\"wasted\\" on this Epic adventure.  Not surprisingly, the hours have turned more into time periods known as days, and I have found myself neglecting most of my normal husband and fatherly duties once I get home from the grind...(thanks for the break Epic). It is definitely more sophisticated, complex, and entertaining that the Original, and seems like it should be handled with some extra TLC because of its complexity. Crazy hard, crazy fun!
0061998494|5.0|Craig Ferguson is a gem...not only does he make us laugh, he shares his humanity with us as well.  This book is wonderful.   Happy (Yesterday) Birthday, Craig!
B004GBIE3Y|3.0|Note: There are a few spoilers in here.  So please do not read if you haven't watched the film yet.  Or please do read if you just want to know what happens.<br /><br />I think it's safe to say that this was Zach Galifianakis' breakthrough performance.  He has always been able to play his usual character.  How awkward can he make a situation without being murdered?  The hilarity isn't just in his performance but in the reaction of others.  It's in his comedy and is shown through his portrayals of other characters in various films such as The Hangover and Due Date.  When I started watching this film, that's what I was expecting, but I found that I was pleasantly surprised by his performance through this film.  He was the perfect foil to the young protagonist.<br /><br />One thing that I did like about the film was that it portrayed depression from a different perspective.  Some people feel that depression is all or nothing.  You've either hit rock bottom or you're just on the surface like everyone else.  Craig, from his own outward appearance and mannerisms, seems completely fine.  He's smart, willing to explore the world, but scared of the possibilities of failure and his inability to overcome his own fears.  His explanation of why he was afraid, a domino effect of one tragedy after another concluding to being lonely and homeless, was brilliant.  It gave me flashbacks of high school and what I feared the most.  Afer all, it's a double edged sword.  There's the fear of what happens after you fail as well as after you succeed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that was the one thing that kept the film enjoyable for me.  I think what I was looking for was a character who is not only relatable but realistic.  And realism for the audience is in the eye of personal experience, but I felt left out of Craig's revelations.  For example, in the beginning he mentions a few of his classmates and their list of accomplishments and finally when it comes to him, underneath his name there is nothing.  I could definitely relate to it.  In his different experiences while at the psychiatric ward, he realizes he loves art and creates wonderful paintings.  In a performance of \\"Changes,\\" he stuns everyone else.  He even helps his own roommate, Muqtada, come out of the room after simply mentioning that there's more out in the world to experience.  It's obvious that he is noticed through motivating others to \\"live\\" just like he wants to.  It's great, but that's when the break in realism happens for me.  Of course, through these characters, there is a reflection of him in each of them.  Each person he helps, he's breaking free a little bit more and more.  With Muqtada, it was the last chain he needed to break free into the real world.  Its symbolism is great, but it's lost on my own feelings toward the film.<br /><br />A few characters within the film fell flat.  Noelle is a perfect example of this.  She is the girl Craig notices in the psychiatric ward, and they take a liking to each other immediately.  However, after watching the film, I felt that she was a part of his world just to include future tension between Craig and Nia (who was also a very flat character).  And please don't judge me for this, but it's Pixies, not The Pixies (yes, I had to include that somewhere).<br /><br />Is this film worth seeing?  Despite my own criticisms toward the film, I think this film is definitely worth seeing.  However, it isn't a repeater.  It won't be in my collection that I could comfortably watch again and again on a desert island.  But for something a little uplifting and funny? Definitely.nitely relate to it.

B0047747A6|5.0|This is without a doubt the best autobiography I have ever read. It takes you into the mind of not only of a musical genius but a true genius. I think.... I'll rephrase that statement, I know a lot of people misunderstood and continue to misunderstand Michael Jackson as a person. He was a kid at heart and loved being around them because they were the only people who didn't want anything from him. So many people used and burned this man during his lifetime including his father it's no wonder he turned into the private reclusive individual he did. anyone who kept up with the life and career of MJ knows he didn't and couldn't harm a child but yet the media dragged him through pure hell on earth. Could you imagine being accused of doing the worst thing you could possibly be accused of? Especially when you have devoted your life to giving back so much to children and helping cure their diseases? He was a true humanitarian giving hundreds of millions of dollars to charity and supporting over 39 of them marking a spot in the guinness book of world records. truly unheard of and even when he was aquitted and vindicated the media still had their field day so they could sell their magazines and newspapers. All of who should be ashamed of theirselves. Here is a man who gave us so much and still had a lot to give but that was cut short I'm sure because of all of the lies that were told and printed as facts. I truly believe there are a lot of people that owe this man an apology, especially all of you \\"reporters\\" out there who printed the garage to make a buck for yourself at the expensive of michael Jackson. Non the less I feel anyone who is interested in the life of the greatest entertainer that ever lived get this book.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I love \\"Rent,\\" and while theatre critics felt some of the songs were a little lightweight for Broadway, I still find it tuneful and powerful.  But in spite of the sadness and drama that surrounds the content of \\"Rent,\\" it was mostly fun and some of it almost intentionally camp.  So the film comes along, being as faithful as it can, removing some of the long windedness of some numbers and characters, but also robbing \\"Rent\\" of some of its fun, but it still mostly works.    The opening of the film is fantastic.  It ALMOST feels like they got the tone down and it looks like one of those classic openings to old musicals - lots of characters, big, flashy and very much in the spirit of the play.  The title number is trimmed, removing some of Joanne's banter and Benjamin's dialgoue.  It's a nice trim an arguable improvement.  It looks like Chris Columbus got this down initially.  And for the first part, the film flows pretty well - acting, music, pacing, fine.    It isn't until the arrival of Maureen that something doesn't seem right.  \\"Rent\\" was a piece carved for the stage and Jonathon Larson crafted some neat scenes for it.  The one that always stuck out was \\"Christmas Bells,\\" not only because to me, it's an important motif, but also because it really captured the grand thing \\"Rent\\" was, featuring alot of good character interplay and building up to the arrival of Maureen.  The way its dones on stage wouldn't carry well to the screen.  So Chris Columbus just kind of skips it, jumping to Maureens stage performance and to La Vie Boheme.  It was always a good piece in the stage play and it feels like there's a gap here in the film.    Act 2 seems a little sloppy, probably because of the staginess of so many scenes.  While the narrative remains effective and in tact, Columbus seems unsure how to do something with \\"What You Own\\" and creates soemthing that resembles an early 90s music video that's almost painful to watch.  Other than that, the second act works on screen, though it's not as well paced as the first part, or the play.    If I have any complaints, they mostly lie in the fact that \\"Rent\\" doesn't have as much fun as it should.  Yes, it's got serious subject matter, but it's loads of fun and celebration - and celebration was always key for Rent.  I feel like Columbus mourns the story a bit more.  Again, this could just be becaus of how the material transitions to screen.        Overall, Rent the  movie is good.  Just try not to compare it to the stage version.  If you want to see a good theatrical performance, check out the DVD of the last show.  Pretty good, in spite of not having the original actors.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I decided to go third party simply because I got sick of dropping the Sony brand controllers (too small for my hands). Here's my experience:    So far, it's a good controller. Similar to the 360, but I will warn newcomers that the left analog stick will take awhile getting used to. It says it has Sixaxis but I haven't been playing any Sixaxis, so I wont comment on that (yet). Supposedly there are dead zones according to a few reviewers, but so far I haven't noticed any (perhaps what I got was a revision?).    One thing I'll say is that the whole lit buttons doesn't seem useful if not for aesthetics (supposed to be helpful when playing in the dark, but, what's a little extra on the energy bill gonna hurt?) however it is activated by hitting Select + O buttons at the same time.    Perhaps my only gripe is the USB extension, but that's only minor. In order to plug it in, you have to plug in the USB extension into some sort of adapter, which I find pretty stupid (why couldn't they just be spliced) and you'll assume that when plugging it into the PS3 port, that it is faced up. No, you have to turn it upside down so the brand name is facing the ground.    But for me, it seems to work just fine. Also, the support grips actually DO work, especially if you don't have a lot of callus on your fingers. Now, all that needs added is a turbo feature and it's perfect.:D
B004OA2G0E|3.0|The King of Limbs is the Radiohead's eighth studio record, and comes on the heels of the impressive \\"In Rainbows\\". They are a band who possess one of the single most acclaimed discographies in rock, and even without the critics, they have fought hard to top themselves on each successive record.  That's why this album is so underwhelming.  TKoL is the sound of a band trying to step away from itself, and out of the shadow of it's own accomplishments. Everything about the record screams it, from the \\"Newspaper\\" special edition of the album (a package made of biodegradable material with the lifespan of a few years), the band's sudden and unceremonious release, or even it's short length.   But the music itself says the most.  Radiohead actually find themselves treading over old ground for once, striking a 50/50 mix between \\"Kid A\\" and Thom Yorke's solo album \\"The Eraser\\". The music is electronic and subdued, with the songs floating in and out without making much of a fuss. Nothing here rises above a middling tempo, and there are no big finishes to provide a moment of cathartic release like \\"Paranoid Android\\" or \\"Jigsaw Falling into Place\\". In fact, the whole album feels like it's always about to lift off, but never does.  That doesn't mean it's a bad record by any means. It fits a mood - the rainy day, don't-want-to-get-off-the-couch kind of mood. The entire second half is actually very strong. \\"Lotus Flower\\" recalls \\"Idioteque\\" from Kid A, with a strong beat and a strangely soulful performance by Thom Yorke. \\"Codex\\" is one of the band's strongest piano ballads yet, with a murky, claustrophobic piano line contrasting nicely with some bright horn work. And \\"Separator\\" does indeed provide resolution, with what is probably one of Radiohead's most optimistic (and beautiful) sounding closers ever. In fact, if tracks two through four were left off, this would have been an incredible EP.   But as it stands, I can't help the nagging feeling that they could've done better. This could have been released as an EP (which was entirely possible, as the Com Lag EP is actually one minute longer than TKoL), and thus avoided the criticism of a new \\"Radiohead Album\\". But instead, they have released what is possibly their \\"weakest\\" album, one that promises great things, but never fully accomplishes them.  December 16th, 2011 EDIT:   When I first wrote this review, Radiohead was maintaining a strong silence, giving little-to-no interviews on the album, and the band didn't fully reappear until a spate of TV appearances in September. In the light of some recent interviews they've given since, it's clear why it seemed to me like they didn't want to be Radiohead - because they don't. With The King of Limbs, they set out to step away from the pressure of releasing a ground breaking, classic \\"Radiohead\\" album each time around (a pressure that nearly broke them up during the recording of In Rainbows). In order to be true to themselves, they had to take a step away from themselves - they no longer want to make immense statements, but rather, enjoy themselves and what they do. In this, The King of Limbs is a huge success.
1589949811|5.0|I purchased LOTR LCG the first day Amazon released it. And I have played several 2,3, and 4 player games both with one set and two sets. I can say that this game is one my favorite games that I have ever played. The theme is very well done and the scenarios that the core set comes with are very well done and play extremely different from one another. I also enjoy the different spheres that you can play with that give you different advantages and disadvantages. The cards are very well done and so are the tokens. There are, however, a few complaints I have. First the insert is absolutely horrible and it really bothers me that FFG has not done anything about this. I really wish they would give us a box that had much better organization in it. Second, I am not a big fan of how FFG went about advertising the game. Many people (including myself) went out and bought 2 core sets to play 3 and 4 player games. If you are a casual gamer you will not need 2 sets. The only reason I can see that FFG advertises 2 sets is simply because of the threat trackers that come with game, there are only 2 threat trackers in a set but that is not a big deal considering all you need is paper or dice to keep track of threat in a game. I really wish FFG was more clear about that. However, if you do plan on building decks for 2 or more people then 2 sets is a really good call.  Overall this game is excellent and very well done. There is a good luck factor but that keeps the game interesting. I can't wait for the future releases of adventure packs in the future.

B004SBB0LU|5.0|If you've been listening to the original late-1980s EMI imports of the first five Queen albums on cd, this is the ultimate remaster or reissue to get.    It's obvious the band & the label have gone all out on this edition of these classic Queen albums.  The audio is crisp and deep - the quiet passages are actually QUIET instead of being filled with hiss and digital noise like on the original EMI imports.  More to their credit, they didn't mess with the mixes, song lengths, or do any of the other shenanigans that bands/labes often do when they do this kind of comprehensive update of their back catalog.    Each album comes with a second disc of extras - this is where the real gold is once you get used to how phenomenal these new remastered albums sound.  \\"Queen\\" includes the ORIGINAL Queen demo songs - all of which made the first album (one of them more so that you ever imagined); it's very interesting to hear the subtle differences between the first demo of \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" and the vast change made between the demo of \\"Jesus\\" and the final album version (it's easily sped up 10 bpm or more).    The other albums' extra discs contain gems culled from BBC sessions and concerts throughout Queen's halcyon days in the 1970s & 80s.  One of the definite highlights is the a capella version of the operatic section in their hit \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" - no auto-tuning here, and the vocal abilities of Freddie, Brian & Roger shine right through.  John gets his own spotlight, too, with a stripped-down version of \\"You're My Best Friend\\" that highlights his musical skills.    All in all, if you're still listening to very old Queen cd's, this is the set to upgrade to.  Simply amazing audio quality.

I just received another today and I must say its better than the original. I have noticed that they must have fixed the loose sheath problem because the one I received is VERY tight and the strap is completely unnecessary. You can hang the knife up side down and forcefully swing it and the knife stays secure ( obviously I do not recommend this action.       Came shaving sharp just like every cold steel product I own.      Highly recommended.  Peace  Doc

B004E0Z4XK|5.0|The album \\"Rome\\" is such a refreshing and brilliant idea, to compose music inspired by Italian movie soundtracks, and then use a jazz singer and an alternative/folk singer to sing on the album? What a risk Danger Mouse was taking here, and he's made quite possibly the best album of the year so far. The album is a musical journey through \\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,\\" for the 21st century! I'm sure this will see some Grammy nominations next year!

They are the off-shoot of a cult that took to the stars to escape technology. Though they are not necessarily amenable to Harrington and her crew, they are vastly better than their neighbors. The neighbors are an offshoot of the original cult that were expelled from the cult's planet, Grayson, and settled on the nearby world of Masada.<br /><br />The People's Republic of Haven, who tried to take over a space terminal at Basilisk in the first book as a preparation for invading Manticore (Honor's home star system) are also back. They are ready to ally themselves with the lunatic Masadans in order to gain a foothold in the Grayson system. In effect, the book is about a Cold War-esque struggle between Haven and the Star Kingdom of Manticore.<br /><br />Given the somewhat backward views on women, Honor takes her ship to do a supply run and leaves a back-up force behind. She thinks this is the best way for the opponents of the Grayson/Manticoran alliance not to use her as an issue to derail the treaty. In her absence, the Haven/Masadan alliance strikes, and the results are devastating losses to both Manticoran and Grayson navies and facilities.<br /><br />Once Honor comes back to the system, she finds that she is outgunned due to the Masadans having control of a Haven warship that can easily destroy her small escort fleet. If help doesn't arrive in time, she, her fleet, and everyone on Grayson, will all die.<br /><br />This might seem a rehash of the first book, and iin some ways, it was. The plot line was similar, yet it was unique enough with some twists and turns to not seem like a complete plot re-tread. Really the amount of thought put into the cultures of Grayson and Masada, and Weber's worldbuilding continue to impress me.<br /><br />The pros of the book also include the respect for religion. Some would think from my description that the author trashes religion, but he does not. This is an in-space version of the difference between, say, Western Christianity and radical Islam/a Koreshian Doomsday cult. Clearly not all  religion is evil. Christianity is widely practiced in the novels timeframe, and not trashed. The religious backdrop was a plot element, not commentary.<br /><br />The other good parts are the same as in the first book. Realism, respect for the enlisted/NCO's, and so forth. However, there were two major problems with the book.<br /><br />The first one is that the plot is still undeniably a recycled plot from the first book with a few changes, and I wanted to see some originality. The great narrative made some difference to help me enjoy the story, but not enough.<br /><br />The second issue I have with this is that the character of Captain Honor Harrington is just too perfect. This is not my bias against officers (even fictional ones) speaking, but my bias as a reader. The way that every other character gushes over Harrington (even many of the bad guys, for goodness sake!) just seemed to out of place. It's like she is the best naval officer in the whole history of man. It just pulled me out of the narrative, as I wanted a main character that is believable, not the infinitely, absurdly best ever. I want a protagonist, in other words, not a Canon Sue.  I fear that Harrington is headed that way, and it isn't good.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, it was an excellent read, and while I can't recommend it as much as the first one, I do recommend it for a good read.

0316286850|3.0|This book is alright. I really enjoyed the beginning, which was basic techniques, and just basic facts on make up. I'm a make up amateur, but was still impressed that I learned something new. Once I got into the different \\"Faces\\" of make up, I kind of got bored. It seems as though after the first few types on full faces, the make up just varies by color, but not really technique. Everyone knows how to swap colors for each technique. With that, I found the whole second half of the book pretty useless. Nice pictures though.

B000Q66Q06|4.0|I wonder if many of you have noticed how often \\"special\\" concerts chock full of stars often in the end disappoint considerably more than one would have thought possible prior to the event, and you end up walking away having enjoyed yourself, but without the \\"Wow\\" factor you had anticipated experiencing. Often the artists donate their services, or realize they are participating in an event which is somehow more important than the music itself, or simply perform as you see in an exhibition tennis match between the top players - which doesn't really count. This 1992 New Year's concert is kind of like that.<br /><br />The pedigree of the participants could hardly be better. The Berlin Philharmonic gives a good account of themselves of course, but it must be said that now, nearly a decade later, we expect better quality sound from the Philharmonie but obviously the engineers were still having a lot of trouble there, particularly at live events. A pity since I have rarely seen Abbado seem to enjoy himself so openly while conducting as he does here. Both \\"Don Juan\\" and \\"Till Eulenspiegel\\" are driven at quite a clip as if the Maestro is afraid he'll be late for a post-concert dinner reservation. Now had he listened more to the recordings by Fritz Reiner he might have noticed there is more majesty and sensitivity in these pieces (and fun in Till) than he had time to bring out.<br /><br />The two biggest disappointments from a musical point of view were the Burleske, and the closing excerpt from Der Rosenkavalier. - Now I am, like most, fascinated and often thrilled by Martha Argerich. Technically, there is nothing she can't do, and she is one of the greatest musical talents before the public today. BUT Strauss did not write Burleske as a duel for Gatling guns (represented by the timpani and piano). Ironically, Amazon carries an ad on the same page of the piece as performed by the American pianist Byron Janis, accompanied by the unsurpassed Fritz Reiner and the CSO who do not fail to bring out the charm, sweetness that it seems Argerich and Abbado had no time for that night.<br /><br />Finally, the closing of Der Rosenkavalier. - I suppose it's unfair to compare this trio and duet with all the great voices who have sung these unforgettable notes for lo these many years, but I expected more from these individually superb singers of today than they delivered that night.<br /><br />All in all, wonderful artists, who could have given us more, and far better recorded too.ut the charm, sweetness that it seems Argerich and Abbado had no time for that night.

B0041X90ZI|5.0|I have been a prog rock fan since Yes and ELP in the early 70s. I did not realize that people were still making music like this! This is fantastic. The melodies intertwine with each other and the vocals are superb. I found Transatlantic by setting up a \\"station\\" on Pandora. I set the station based on Triumvirate, a German prog band from the mid 70s, and was very surprised at how much new music is there for me.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|My Husband suggested that we watch this. I was not that keen, but thought I would give it a go. Wow, what a pleasant suprise. First epsisode was excellent and it was imediately apprarent that Alex and Scott had that screen chemistry that can make or break a show. Their carguments are brilliant and I am sure that they have many laughs while filming them. Right from the first episode I cared about the charactors and wanted to get to know them. Have not seen the full season yet as I am in the UK but cant wait for each new episode. Well done to all of those involved, I look forward to the rest of this seson and many more.

It's incredibly easy to use and I love that you can select the output type of the file (mp3, video file etc.) Extra points for being FREE!!!!  =)    I do wish that you could select the quality of the youtube video you want based on quality options on youtube for that particular video. (i.e. when you watch a video on youtube on your computer and it has 1080p, 720p, 360p, etc. you would be able to select from those options when using the app to download a video). I also wish that it would resume to download a file when you lose data connection automatically instead of stopping the download entirely then having to re-download it.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This mic is show as commonly being used with a DVR by amazon.  The problem is that the amp in it is not powerful enough.  The internal mike works better.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I never like this program in the 70's and 80's because I thought it was soooooooo boring! But now, with the change of characters, especially Grace Park, & more than anyone else, Scott Caan (he is the high-light of this show!) I find it to be interesting, fun to watch, and even though I'm living with my mother for right now, I've reserved an hour at 9 pm each Monday just to watch this program. When I watch it, I find myself getting so involved in it. It was addicting from the start, and I fully intend to purchase this when it comes out on dvd!

B004SIP6N6|4.0|Clerks finally made it's blu-ray appearance and it's still the same great movie. Love the slapstick wit! The conversion is pretty good. Nice blu-ray but don't expect top notch graphics or CGI. The movie is in black and white anyway. Dolby DTS is also supported. Grab it for some great laughs!
0307279189|5.0|I'm not a runner but my son is. He recommended I read this and although I was hesitant I am so glad I did. It's a great story with common sense information about running. The way children run is the way we should run, not the way the shoe manufactures have told us to do. Entertaining and informative.
0920668372|1.0|This is my all time LEAST favorite children's book.  The story opens sweetly but progresses into a weird stalking scenario, coupled with illustrations that project a sense of obsession and maniacal behavior and expressions.  Expressing parental love is both touching and right, but this treatment of it is simply neither of those things.

0439023513|5.0|I couldn't put the first two books down and I can say the same for this last one. I will probably read them all again. I think about the story and the characters quite often even though I finished reading them a month ago. It was so nice getting the book at least a day earlier than amazon ha estimated. Thanks Amazon.

B001TK3XPE|4.0|The meandering nature of this book makes me wonder if Lodge had half a dozen pieces lying around and decided to tie them up together in a book (experiments in the effects of changing between first and third person; musings on deafness; style in suicide notes; retirement; health spas; aged parents; and the particularly inserted meditation on Auschwitz). There's no central narrative driving this to nearly the same degree as his other novels (except, perhaps, the more chronological than plot driven [[ASIN:0140057463 How Far Can You Go]]), but I suspect this was actually a good thing.<br /><br />Spoilers.<br /><br />A decade before he may have centred the story around the prurience of an affair between a Professor and an attractive Doctoral student (i.e. typically Lodge turning a sexual fantasy into a story), but, deep sigh of relief, he finally seems to have reached an age where adultery isn't the happy focus of his daydreams. Perhaps it was heading in this direction but Lodge himself, much as the semi-autobiographical narrator, may have found his direction suddenly changed by the decreasing health of his father. Whatever, thank goodness the sexually twisted Alex becomes a minor (and, ironically as a result, more layered and sympathetic) character, and Desmond's actions more mature and feasible.<br /><br />So instead of the juvenile titillation souring much of the otherwise rich journey Lodge can offer (as in [[ASIN:0142000868 Thinks . . .]]), most of this novel is spent with a deft narrator sensitively detailing events we can relate to, and insightfully opening us up to others that we may not. Lodge is beautifully readable, and well able to convey his insightful responses to experience. You feel that Lodge is more able to be honest with himself than some of us. While this is a very loose structure, Lodge does successfully weave his elements into some sort of coherence (except, perhaps, the Polish excursion, which could just as easily have been a column. Then again, there is some added value in seeing how a character we've come to know incorporates a visit to Birkenau into his everyday life).<br /><br />There is less of a story here than a narration of a certain life period. Some books, perhaps, more successfully combine the two - this is far more about the latter than the former - but it is assured, deft, and dignified, even in the midst of the acknowledged comic potential of deafness.ue in seeing how a character we've come to know incorporates a visit to Birkenau into his everyday life).

1594744769|4.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is set in modern times with adventures into WWII.  It creates an intriguing setting for young Jacob's story to discover his true identity and that of his grandfather.    I find my self puzzled as to whether I truely enjoyed or am simply confused by it.  I can honestly say that it was unlike anything I had read before and was not what I expected.  Although eccentric, it compelled me to keep reading.  The story of young Jacob and his band of \\"peculiar\\" friends provided me with enough enjoyment to recommend it to someone who enjoys fantasy type reading endeavors.  It seems like a set up for a series, but I think I just might read those too.  Overall, the writing is solid and interesting enough.    The use of photography amidst the writing in this novel is truely revolutionary.  The photos of these \\"peculiar\\" children are intertwined with their stories.  Although I was reading this as a novel, the photography is to be noted.  While appalling upon first glance, it draws the viewer to take a second and deeper look.     Overall, eccentric and \\"peculiar\\" I enjoyed Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Amazing! I cant believe how fun this is! This is going to take a lot more skill to play with compared to the original. Hopefully I will solve it soon.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I had no idea when I started reading this book that it was the first in a series.  This book is so captivating and interesting with the mix of the supernatural and history that I could not put it down, and now..... I am left hanging...waiting for the next book to come.   I have been dreaming about the characters since I begun reading and after I read the last line I could not stop my mind from trying to figure out what is next.      This is a great read!      P.s. If you like the Twilight series at all, you will LOVE this!  And you wont have to feel embarrassed that you are reading about a bunch of teenagers ;)
0811876373|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is very well written and explained and has a coordinating picture with the steps. The ideas are very cute and can work for both beginners and for the little more advanced in skill. I would recommed this book.

B002ZG981E|1.0|At least two thirds of the movie was Cops and Robbers. Good Guys and Bad Guys. Same old, same old. Nothing but testosterone. Fist fights. Cold blooded machine gun murders. Blowing things up along with unecessarily loud, overly dramatic music throughout. I stopped caring what it was about halfway through and just wanted the gunfire and explosions to stop. Huge disappointment. I wish I could get my $3.99 back from renting this movie.

I found out that tranferring pictures using Itunes is not that difficult as it always the case with Apple product.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|How can I not love it? Mix up marines and aliens and you always have me as a viewer. Was it perfect? No, but it was one of the best of its kind. Talking movies, I'd rate this higher than \\"Starship Troopers\\", \\"War of the Worlds\\" (latest version) or \\"Independence Day\\". \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" are better, in my opinion. If you haven't seen the movie, give it a go. I liked the serious take on events (meaning there are no comic-relief robots in this movie). The abilities of the aliens did seem to vary with the demands of the script, and some elements of the \\"mission\\" are dubious. If you want some cool action, effects and tech warfare, it doesn't get much better.<br />-BVL
B00004T9UF|3.0|This album is extremelly overrated. I didn't say I didn't like it but sort of regret buying it. I brought it because this album is supposed to be gritty, hardcore and one of Eminem's best work. This album...is NOTHING compared to The Eminem Show. Only a few decent tracks on this album. The Eminem Show - ALL the tracks are good. There is harldy any consistancy in this album. The Eminem Show - true consistancy. If you people think this is good then I beg you to purchase The Eminem Show because this is nothing compared to The Eminem Show album
B004DCB62M|2.0|This was the first Kindle book I bought. I have the stories, of course, all of them, but I really wanted the complete collection on my Kindle--it's one of the great things with the Kindle, the fact that you can carry all of your favourites with you and still get by an overnight packing. A safe bet, I figured.    As far as the stories go, it was. But this particular version is let down by poor formatting, with broken lines mid page and with illustrations cut in half, and by a table of contents that is only partly working. What good is  link to a short story when the link leads you to... the beginning of the collection in which the story first appeared? Useless and annoying. Yes, it's cheap but so is [[ASIN:B004XNLKI6 Sherlock Holmes Illustrated and Complete]], and it's got perfect formatting and all of the illustrations, plus an introduction, notes, and more. Buy it instead.
B000VWSINI|5.0|This album is by far...the most...incredible thing I've ever heard. His power his superb on this album.

0062060554|5.0|With a premise as deceptively simple as this, execution is everything.  How does one create a coherent first person narrative wherein the protagonist does not remember anything from the last chapter?  In this case, Watson met the challenge in such a way that I was riveted from the disoriented beginning to startling end.      \\"I look up at the mirror.    \\"The face I see looking back at me is not my own.  The hair has no volume and is cut much shorter than  I wear it; the skin on the cheeks and under the chin sags; the lips are thin; the mouth turned down.  I cry out, a wordless gasp that would turn into a shriek of shock were I to let it, and then notice the eyes.  The skin around then is lined, yes, but despite everything else, I can see that they are mine.  The person in the mirror is me, but I am twenty years too old.  Twenty-five.  More.    \\"This isn't possible.  I begin to shake and grip the edge of the sink.  Another scream begins to rise in my chest and this one erupts as a strangled gasp.  I step back, away from the mirror...I step back farther, until I feel cold tiles against my back.  It is then I get the glimmer that I associate with memory.  As my mind tries to settle on it, it flutters away, like ashes caught in a breeze, and I realize that in my life there is a then, a before, though before what I cannot say, and there is a now, and there is nothing between the two but a long, silent emptiness that has led me here....\\"    Somehow, even though Christine wakes up each day without any recent memory, the narrative still progresses logically and in a fast paced manner.  The mystery and suspense are built in as, seen through Christine's unreliable perspective, everything is suspicious and baffling.  The truth, or Christine's perception of what was true, was constantly shifting and changing, yet I as the reader was able to hang on the roller coaster ride.    Who do you trust when you have no recollection of what people are telling you?  Despite being nearly incapacitated with her amnesia, somehow Christine painstakingly pieces together a fragmented picture of what happened and what is being kept from her by those she's supposed to trust - her husband and her doctor - both of whom are telling her different versions of her life.  To make things even more complicated, what they're telling her also contradict the few puzzling memories that eventually resurface.      Christine's sanity and identity are assaulted every time she wakes up but something is horribly wrong beyond Christine's amnesia and how it has wrecked her life.  How Christine manages to uncover the devastating and shocking truth inspite of being unable to rely upon her own recollection is a marvel of storytelling.  Before I Go to Sleep is not a perfect, airtight book - it has some logical holes - but I never saw what was coming; I was as stunned as Christine!

B004E0Z4XK|4.0|With Rome it becomes official, Brian \\"Danger Mouse\\" Burton is the Quentin Tarantino of modern music, jumping from genre to genre, putting his own twist on classic sounds. Most often credited for his production work, Burton has become a well rounded artist since recording 2003's underground classic, Ghetto Pop Life, with a still-mostly-unknown emcee named Jemini. He's a musician, producer, actor, director and, in a way, a frontman. An auteur, really. Having produced records for Gorillaz, MF Doom, The Rapture, Sparklehorse, Gnarls Barkley, Damon Albarn, The Black Keys, Beck, Broken Bells and now U2, the man once only known for his Beatles/Jay-Z mash-up record has proven himself to be three things: 1) reliable, as just about everything he touches sells quite well; 2) diverse, working with an unlikely batch of artists over the years; and 3) prolific, having produced 20 full length albums in under nine years, most of which feature a big, big sound.    Rome, a Spaghetti Western-inspired full-length Burton recorded over three or so years with Italian Composer Daniele Luppi, plays through like a lost late-60s film score, mixing the obvious influence of Ennio Morricone's signature sound with elements of operatic pop, symphonic rock and instrumental hip-hop. We hear harpsichord, hammond organs, celesta, choirs and strings, all combining to create a widescreen sound that passes quickly and softly, background music for the modern listener. Two World Class guest stars pop up in Norah Jones and Jack White, each featured as lead vocalists on three tracks a piece. Also along for the ride is legendary Italian choir Cantoi Moderni (once featured on the soundtrack for Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and opera singer Edda Dell'Orso (who sang in Leone's films), adding to the authenticity already established by Luppi's involvement.    So how then, we wonder, does a project like this come together? Who'd have ever believed that a soundtrack for an imaginary film from the 1970s would be a featured title on Big Box end caps around the country? Easy: it all comes back to Paste Magazine's pick for Producer of the Decade, Brian Burton, the man responsible for an endless number of hit songs (including chart-busting hits \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\"), critical love, notable awards and, most importantly, oddball collaborations. Determined to keep their record as authentic as possible, Burton and Luppi assembled a super band of Italian players, next booking time at one of Morricone's old studios, where everyone assembled and began working on the record. From there, Luppi and Burton wrote the songs; Luppi conducted the choir and orchestra; and Burton wrote lyrics and produced the sessions.    What we end up with is a chill-out record with a big - though subtle - sound. While the vibe here is certainly cinematic and dusty in a Leone sort of way, I can't help but think of bands like Zero 7, Air and Nightmares on Wax, all of whom have released records that share many of the characteristics that make Rome tick. Tossed in the mix of sweet and epic arrangements are White and Jones, whose vocals add a pop element to the recordings. Lead single \\"The Rose with the Broken Neck,\\" featuring White's croon, is an instantly likable track that could easily be featured in a future James Bond film; meanwhile the dreamy - and poppy - \\"Season's Trees,\\" featuring Jones, sounds very much like it could've come from Stuart Murdoch's still-recent God Save the Girl project. \\"Black,\\" also featuring Jones, is one of the standout cuts from the record, featuring a 70s psych vibe before turning into a jazzy pop song.    Closer \\"The World,\\" featuring White, is a big and memorable composition that has the feel of a closing credits track, stocked with all the bells in Rome, big string arrangements and plenty of choral swoons. It's the best song on a record full of memorable, hazy moments. Clocking in at 35 minutes over 15 tracks, Rome is just the right amount of music, never coming off as boring or indulgent. A passion project done right.    Check out more of my music- and film-related writing at [...]
B00001W9G0|5.0|Bought this DVD for my Mom as a Mother's Day gift.  She has always loved this movie and didn't have a copy.  My name actually came from this movie!  It arrived sooner than I thought and was new, packaged in plastic.
0061997811|5.0|This is one great book. I love that you have included parts of each movie. The graphics are great. This is a perfect coffee table book,especially if you are a Harry Potter fan(and who isn't).
0810994739|4.0|I like this book  because it a very interesting book. An if you don't anything to do and if you are bored you should read this book. It's a fact that it's really interesting and funny.            I liked how the main character Gregory gets into trouble. Also I liked how Rodrick, Gregory's brother gets into to more trouble than Gregory does. Rodrick does worse things than Gregory, like he throws parties while their parents are gone.    Gregory gets into trouble for taking mom bucks. Gregory takes the mom bucks and thought his mom wouldn't notice the missing mom bucks. She would trade it in for real money so Gregory can get his sweet diary that he wanted. Gregory stole the mom bucks while his mom's back was turned.      Gregory's mom did find out that the mom bucks were missing because she had count the mom bucks money and she didn't have as much as she had before. She noticed that Gregory has a lot of mom bucks because he found something that he really wanted which was a sweet diary and he been trading in a lot of mom buck for real money. So she already knew that it was Gregory taking the moms buck because there isn't anyway of him get mom bucks from some body else except from her. Mom bucks is fake money that their mom gives to them after they're done doing their chores. Then they trade it in for real money.    .  The good parts of the story is when the family gets along with each other until their mom births a new child and it just destroys everything Gregory and Rod rick  doesn't like the new child at all. The bad parts in the story is when Rod rick  and Gregory thinks that they can do what ever they want just because they want to and they don't know how to behave in this story at all and they are always fighting with each other.          I think that 4th, 5th, and 6th graders should read this book because it's a very interesting   Book to read. An they would enjoy reading it for when they don't have anything planed for a day or something like that. If they feellike reading they really should ready this book for my opinion.
0618680004|5.0|This is an excellent commentary on religious belief and why such belief is not rational.  Religious belief requires belief in the supernatural, something that I as a retired research engineer cannot accept.  I recommend this book strongly as a lesson in critical thinking.
0385732554|5.0|The Giver Review     The book I read is called The Giver. The setting of the story is in a community. Jonas, the main character, is an 11 year old boy who attends a ceremony where he is turning 12. At the ceremony Jonas finds that his job will be the Receiver of Memories. Jonas gets his memories from the Giver. The Giver is the original Receiver of Memories. Jonas is lucky to be the Receiver of Memories.     To be the Receiver of Memories the Giver has to give Jonas the memories by having Jonas lie on a bed and the Giver touches his back. Jonas has his eyes closed, he is relaxed and he receives the memories.      The Giver has bad memories and good memories. One bad memory was war. A good memory was Christmas when he sees a family all gathered together around the Christmas tree and opening presents.     Jonas wants to leave the community because he wants to make choices instead being forced to follow rules that he doesn't want to follow. He wants to see color and he wants the memories to be real. He also wants to share the memories with other people in the community.      I liked this book and would recommend this book to ages 12 and up. I would recommend this book because it's a good book and it has an interesting plot and setting.................

B00280LYHS|5.0|Almost 16 year old Percy Jackson knows that since a prophecy says the next child of the big three to turn 16 has to make a choice to end the Greek Gods or not, and that's him. To save His godly relatives (that aren't in Tartarus, a nasty place where people who did bad things that aren't forgivable) he has to defeat his godly grandpa Kronos whose spirit was transported to Percy's evil cousin Luke a son of Hermes.     Though I loved the book I thought the ending was unclear to me. Everything else was as clear as water. I would recommend this book to people who know some of the Greek gods to stay clear of confusion.

1423113497|5.0|Percy Jackson and the Olympians           The book I selected was Percy Jackson and the Olympians   It's about a young boy whose world is changing. He finds outt his best rover  is a half- goat. Percy's father is Poseidon the water god. After almost getting attacked by a teacher that was a weird creature Percy found all this out.              I Would commend this to 10-15 year olds it's very thrilling book for example, he had to go though Medusa to find the golden marbles. It's sad through because the evil creature takes Percy's mother and Percy has to go through training and kill the evil creature to save his mother. Through the whole book kept me interested it was interesting and the kind of book I was looking for. My favorite part of the story was when Percy's reunites with his with his father and gets his mother.

Greg is in middle school but his wimpy acting makes his Dad want to stick him in a military academy.     I liked the book because it is funny when Greg uses his Moms robe and stands over a heater vent because he stays warm and the robe puffs up, it is an easy book, and it is part of a series of books to read called Diary of a Wimpy kid.    I recommend this book for ages 7 and up, because a lot of people started when I was 7 years old, and my Mom read some of it when she was 38 years old.

B004BSFSTA|5.0|The Marshall Major headphones are wonderful.    Pros  - cheap (compared to Bose/Dr. Dre/ etc.  - wonderful sound quality  - extremely portable  - made by Marshall!  - aesthetically beautiful  - plus, they are different. . . everyone and their mother doesn't have them    Cons  - after 3 or 4 hours of listening to to them while laying down they get somewhat uncomfortable.    I would definitely recommend these to anyone. I have a friend who spent $350 on Bose, and after trying mine he conceded that altho his had some fancier features mine were great for being 1/4 of the price.
B00506FFYU|1.0|what a great set.  although a bit pricey, it's a fun build and has lots of special pieces.  a good set for any boy or girl.  The price on the lego website is $149.99.  so, you can avoid the unbelievable $50 mark-up very easily.
1400052173|4.0|THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS by Rebecca Skloot is part examination of the HeLa cell, a cell taken from (not donated by) Henrietta Lacks when she was being treated at Johns Hopkins for cervical cancer. The other part of this book tells the story of Henrietta, and her family both before and after her death.     During the 1950s Henrietta Lacks had a two-timing husband, five children, and several medical problems that she left untreated, including syphilis. When she learned she had cervical cancer, she also ignored that for as long as she could but eventually went to Johns Hopkins Hospital, where she could receive free treatment.     Shortly before Henrietta died, Johns Hopkins took a tissue sample from her cervix. As was routine and perfectly legal in the 1950s and for many years later, no one asked for her or her family's permission. And no one acknowledged her for her \\"donation\\" when the resulting HeLa cell made possible so much medical research and discoveries.     I should mention that Henrietta was black because that fact has everything to do with her children's reactions years later.     Because the HeLa cell could live indefinitely, which other cells could not, HeLa was reproduced in large quantities. Johns Hopkins gave the HeLa cell to just about anyone who asked all over the world at no cost.     As a result, medical research was advanced, but for years Henrietta's family was never aware of any of it. No one was deliberately hiding anything from them; but no one felt it necessary to tell them. The first the family heard of it was when Johns Hopkins wanted to test their blood 20 years later. And there began the first of many, many misunderstandings.     Day, Henrietta's husband, got the call but understood that they wanted to get blood samples from Henrietta's children to test them for cancer. So they all gave blood samples, then became angry when they were never given results of the \\"tests.\\"     The Lacks family was angry with Johns Hopkins Hospital and University and the researchers working with HeLa cells for more than 30 years for various reasons, all misunderstandings. And they most often didn't change their minds, even when told otherwise.     The author of THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS, Rebecca Skloot, had the patience of a saint! She gave up years of her time in pursuit of information for this book, much of it wasted because of the family's misunderstandings. And even when things appeared to be going well, a family member might suddenly mistrust her, again as a result of a misunderstanding (that she was working for Johns Hopkins, who they also mistrusted as a result of misunderstanding). Once, one of Henrietta's children, Deborah, even went so far as to physically attack Skloot because of a (you guessed it) misunderstanding.     So much of this book is devoted to clearing up misunderstandings, I found it mostly frustrating. However, Skloot did clear up the misunderstandings and, in doing so, told interesting stories within this story, for example, the actual history of Johns Hopkins, so mistrusted by not only the Lacks family but many other black people as well.     Skloot also related science in easy-to-understand language. It was a pleasure to read for that reason but also because, although I was aware of the various research projects she mentioned, I had not known how a minute cell had made them possible.
B004EWEX9Y|2.0|I use this cable in my car to charge and get the AV into the car's system, but when I tried to do a sync at work with this cable (my regular charge/sync cable was at home) it turned my iPhone 3G into a brick.  At first it connected, but then it started erasing all my apps and then disconnected from iTunes.  It refused to reconnect, and when I tried to do a reset, the phone bricked.  When I got home I used the original charge/sync cable, and was able to do a complete reset and restore (2+hrs-arrgh!).  It's fortunate that I did a backup just two days ago.  Don't think that just because this has a dock connector on one end and a USB on the other that you can sync with this.  They should warn users DO NOT SYNC WITH THIS CABLE!
B004TTMYQG|4.0|I used this product side-by side with Touch Calendar Pro. While I like Business Calendar, it did not really offer me a reason to replace Touch Calendar Pro, or even the built-in Android calendar, for that matter.<br /><br />The agenda-style widgets waste a lot of space and can only display about 1/2 the information in the same real estate as Agenda Widget.<br /><br />It's a good product, but needs something to really set it apart in a segment filled with great, strong offerings (including the free and excellent Jorte).
1936719010|5.0|This is my first review, and I felt compelled to write something about this book since it gave me so much.     This book takes an hour or less to read, and it is free (well now anyway)...  What do you have to lose?

If you're someone who is searching, wanting to do something that you know deep down you can do, but are held back by fears, doubts, your family, your friends, or yourself, READ THIS BOOK NOW.      Truly a valuable read, one of my new favorites.  Thank you so much.

B004QPOVF0|1.0|Can't understand. Well, maybe I do. If previous DVD releases with this catastrophic headache-inducing editing sold, why change it?<br /><br />I went for this with high expectations that this did not follow the same trend of previous releases (not only by AC/DC, but by other bands as well). No such luck. Editing is atrocious, you can barely watch someone playing at all, the takes are all over the place, changing from second to second.<br /><br />Gosh, it's so frustrating. You know the music is there (after all, you're listening to it!), the performance is there, but can simply NOT SEE IT!<br /><br />Avoidable.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I would not describe myself as a zombie fan.  That doesn't mean I don't occasionally get lured over to that territory through popular culture or a particularly irresistible bit of story-telling.  I have no cable television in my home, but even I'd heard enough buzz on The Walking Dead to be intrigued.  After all, it's the same network that brought us Mad Men, and I've been hooked on those DVDs for years.  Still, as scary as 60's-era advertising execs are, I wasn't sure I was prepared for zombies.  I called my buddy Jimbo and asked, \\"Will The Walking Dead be too scary for me?\\"  His answer: \\"Yes.  But you have to watch it anyway for the story-telling.\\"  As usual, Jimbo was right on both counts.<br /><br />In the extended pilot episode, a Georgia sheriff's deputy is shot in the line of duty.  He eventually awakens, scruffily bearded, in the hospital after an unknown period of time.  He is still weak, bandaged, and disoriented.  Is he really awake at all?  Because he's awoken alone in a nightmare world.  The hospital is deserted, and there are terrifying signs of violence everywhere.  The morgue has been locked down tight, but there are... things behind the door.  Outside, he finds dozens of decaying bodies lined up like logs.  So begins Rick Grimes' odyssey in a wholly changed world.  Eventually he meets other survivors who explain that the dead have risen and who give Rick the basic info on this brave new world.  His only immediate goal is to survive and find his wife and son.<br /><br />Enough can not be said about the quality of this television series.  From performances, design, special effects and makeup, writing, and direction, this series on the small screen rivals anything you'd see on the big screen.  I don't believe I've ever seen the horror genre treated with such respect and intelligence.  The Walking Dead won't appeal to a universal audience, but there is simply no denying how good it is.<br /><br />The first season DVDs contain a mere six episodes, but they include a nice variety of DVD extras ranging from several making of-style documentaries to a how to achieve zombie makeup tutorial for Halloween.  I was disappointed by the lack of commentary tracks, but hopefully they'll be included next season.<br /><br />Yes, Jimbo was right.  This show is way too scary for me.  I watched these episodes one at a time, with the lights on, and not before bed.  They truly scared me to the point that I could barely continue watching them.  I was cursing Jimbo the whole time and swore that I would not be watching season two.  But by the time episodes five and six were viewed, I knew it was hopeless.  I'm hooked.

0596806027|5.0|When I first saw this book, I was a bit surprised by how short it was.  This turns out to be a good thing.  HTML5 (which, in this book, as is common elsewhere, is defined loosely to include things like geolocation, which are not strictly speaking part of HTML5) has a number of new features, ranging from \\"ok, I guess someone might use that sometime\\" to \\"woah! Why didn't we have this years ago? This will make everything so much better and easier!\\"  This book methodically walks through them all, giving plenty of detail to understand things well while not belaboring any points.  The author's writing style is never dry.  While he sometimes fails to be as funny as he's trying to be, and does indulge in a few tangents, the book reads very easily from cover to cover while still working very well as a reference afterwards.  I'd recommend it to anyone who understands HTML and wants to know what all of this HTML5 talk is about.  But that reminds me: if you are new to the world of HTML, this is not the book for you.  It definitely is written for people who are already working with HTML4/XHTML.

B0036TGSIK|5.0|A+ to the writers for this movie.  Very well written, with a great cast to deliver the lines.  Emma Stone was wonderful in her role as Olive.  I really enjoyed her interactions with her parents and her teacher.  Ignore the negative reviews, they either did not understand the comedy or just went into the movie with the wrong mindset.  I highly recommmend this to everyone.
B000KWZ7VU|4.0|Barenboim is not my favorite interpreter of these works -- I prefer Arrau's delicacy -- but these live concerts are a marvel nonetheless. He plays all thirty-two sonatas from memory. Incredible. I only detected a handful of minor flubs.    The video production is very classy, the best I've yet seen for a solo piano concert, with a warm, lush lighting scheme. There are SEVEN cameras surrounding the instrument from every angle. There's even a camera high above and slightly behind Barenboim, looking down with the keyboard stretching from one end of the widescreen image to the other. Splendid! The video switching is conservative and generally very tasteful. I only wish they'd used that spectacular overhead view more, and showed fewer extreme closeups of the artist's face. The poor fellow sweats a lot.    The audio is uncompressed stereo PCM, and of excellent quality. A closely-spaced pair of microphones is visible, suspended in front and above the instrument. The perspective is very close and clear, with little or no audience noise (except for applause between sonatas, of course).    It's hard to imagine this repertory getting a better treatment anytime soon. Too bad this isn't a Blu-ray. Looks great on my HDTV anyway.    What I would have given to attend this concert series in person ...
B000FBJFSC|5.0|My daughter had to read this book for her high school English class this year. This is not her type of book but by the time she finished it she was ready to read the sequel \\"Tis\\". She asked me to read it because she thought it would be something I would like. I am so glad that I did! This is fantastic. I wasn't sure at first that I would like it considering it was written from a child's point of view, but that turned out to be what made me love it. I think that McCourt is a very talented writer. When my daughter is finished with \\"Tis\\", I will be picking it up.

B003Y74AXO|4.0|Once on, this screen protector works great. Smudges clean off well and it performs as one would expect. It had no negative effect on the iPad's touch-screen sensitivity. However getting it on was a bit of a challenge, as even once the screen was cleaned the sticky side of the protector immediately attracted dust once the adhesive film was removed. In the end there were a few bubbles between the protector and screen that I just couldn't get rid of. I'll say this was 50% due to design, and 50% due to user error. Overall however I'm happy with this screen protector.

B000MAH5O2|5.0|This was the 1st Book I read by then US Senator Barack Obama.I was very impressed with his Social, Economic and Foreign Policy views. They mirror mine almost word for word. But the real world fact that a Senator or now as US President cannot just implement those policies without agreement with both the Senate and The House of Representatives.  During the Presidential campaign of 2008 Senator Obama was racked over the coals for a comment of \\"Well you have to spread the Wealth around\\" which I believe would be sound policy and make the US a stronger country  but in the current political climate is probably not going to happen anytime soon. In this book Obama talks about trying to still be both a husband and Father while juggling a career in politics he seems to have accomplished both with a great degree of sucess.

B0013ND36G|4.0|T3 seems to be bashed or forgotten amongst critics and several people I know, but though its not the best of the first three, it still has structure/feel of T1 and T2.  The story picks up several years after part two and you ultimately find out what happened in part two didn't stop Skynet from taking over, but rather delayed the takeover.  The story does seem to expand on John Conner's role in the coming war, but T3 also includes his future spouse and how they meet.      The action and the one liners in this movie are still great.  The title \\"Rise of the Machines\\" did leave the series open.  T3 is definitely non-stop and exiciting.  It does complete T1 and T2 and keeps in line with what we come to expect with a Terminator movie.    (I think Terminator Salvation took the series away from its roots and didn't provide anything new.  Hopefully, when T5 comes out, the series will end on a good note.)

1400052173|5.0|There are several medical ethical stories that people who are interested in this genre absolutely have to read and know about. Some of them are the medical horrors perpetuated by the Nazis on Jews and the disabled during WWII, the Tuskegee syphillis 'experiments' (or whatever they called those things), and the giving of hepatitis to severely retarded children at Willowbrook State Hospital in New York. This book and story about the taking of tissue of Henrietta Lacks without her consent, especially while she was very ill with cancer (and getting inappropriate treatment or not enough treatment) is another one of these ethical stories that will be taught in medical ethics classes from now on.     Skloot did a phenomenal job of research, and in dealing with the emotional outcome of her research. Unlike so many people who don't want to become emotionally involved in the victims of their stories, Skloot did just that and it makes the book so much more real to the reader because she knew these people, and became involved with them and their lives. The loss of their mother was real, it had an ongoing impact for several generations. Even worse, was while doctors and corporations raked in the profits from Henrietta's cells, her own family suffered from the lack of medical insurance or medical care, which is absolutely criminal. The very least that Hopkin's or the pharma companies or the tissue companies that used Henrietta's tissues could do would be to pay for her family's medical care.    This book was one of the best written medical books I've read in years. Skloot also said at the end of the book where all the people of the family and where some of the medical researchers were now. At the very back she also talked about the ethics of what happens to the tissue of anyone who goes into the hospital for any procedure. There is currently no legal protection on the books to keep doctors, hospitals, or corporations from using anyone's tissues for anything that they would like which is extremely disconcerting. She brings up an ethical problem that should be bothering everyone, including Congress...    One thing I would like to emphasize, is that a lot more is known about cervical cancer than was known back in the '40s and the '50s. I'm not excusing the behavior of the doctors at all...they were inexcusable. But Henrietta and her husband were too young to be having sex. I teach anatomy and physiology to nurses, and I have a list of why teenagers are more prone to getting Sexually Transmitted Diseases like HPV, and then getting cancer of the cervix. For girls, their immune systems for that area don't kick in really until they are 21...so Henrietta started having sex probably before 13. Plus her husband was having sex with other women, and bringing home HPV, syphillis, and other STDs...all of which impacted her cervical cells. Sure her genes had something to do with it, but exposure to the viruses also had a lot to do with it. If you don't get exposed to the viruses early and often, you don't get cancer. Plus she was poor, with little to eat, poor medical care, exposed to chemicals in the environment, etc. all the risks for cancer (probably smoked too). She couldn't win here. Now they have this new vaccine for HPV, but that doesn't protect against disease like HIV or the new antibiotic resistant gonnorhea. And viruses and bacteria are smart...a lot of them are changing to becoming resistant to our medications against them. The only things we can control is our behaviors. This is what I teach my nurses...

B003UESJH4|4.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" tells the personal story of a monarch with a speech impediment at a time when he was needed as a public speaker more than ever - the beginning of WWII.  It's so well crafted that I can't think of a single thing I'd change to make it a better film.  That it tell its story well is undisputed.<br /><br />However, despite winning Best Picture, I just can't get that excited about this movie.  To me a Best Picture is supposed to be somehow epic in either presentation (The English Patient) or in meaning/metaphor (Million Dollar Baby).  I just don't think there's enough meat here to chew on as either a Best Picture or as a permanent home in my DVD collection.<br /><br />This is all personal quibbling.  If you like truly good movies by all means watch it.  And you should already know if you want to own this film.  If you like biographies or period films then there's a strong chance you're going to want to keep \\"The King's Speech\\" in your collection.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It constantly kept me suprised by the twists and turns of the story. Pia is a very strong herione and is perfectly matched with Dragos, the powerful Elder. Both Pia and Dragos must overcome obstacles physically and emotionally before they can truly come together. Pia must decide if she can embrace her Wyr nature and true being. Dragos must decide if loving Pia is more important than controlling her. This book brought me out of a \\"reading slump\\". All of the characters are defined and provide more life to the story. You will meet Tricks, the lavendare-haired Faerie that does Dragos PR work. There is also Graydon and Rune, Dragos right-hand men that are responsible for watching Pia and keeping her safe. This is a series you don't want to miss!
0307887960|4.0|I will begin with this disclosure - I have not yet been on this diet.  I am simply reviewing the book at this point.  The Dukan Diet is very similar to other low-carb diets such as [[ASIN:1590770021 Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution, Revised Edition]] and [[ASIN:B000W97200 The South Beach Diet - The Delicious, Doctor-designed, Foolproof Plan For Fast And Healthy Weight Loss]].  It is closest to the South Beach Diet, yet it is a lot stricter because for much of the diet, nothing is allowed but protein and a small amount of oat bran.  The author acknowledges that constipation can be a serious problem:  \\"Your pharmacist can offer advice and may recommend some natural products.  If these products are not enough, you need to see your doctor.\\"  (But won't your doctor just say, \\"Eat a more fiber-rich diet, you idiot!\\"?  This seems extreme to me and a big red flag.)  One major difference from Atkins, is that Dukan does not allow extra fat.  He says, \\"Fats are the absolute enemy of anyone trying to be slim.\\"  The crux of the diet is a sort of Induction Phase, called \\"The Attack Phase,\\" which lasts from 1-10 days depending on the dieter's weight loss goals.  This phase allows lean meats, some organ meats, fish, poultry, eggs, tofu, seitan, nonfat dairy, 1 1/2 tablespoons of oat bran and a whole lot of water.     From this phase, the dieter moves on to a schedule of roughly 5 days of pure protein + 5 days of protein and vegetables although there are alternative balances of days available.  Dukan also advocates daily walking.  The last 60 pages of the book are helpful recipes.     There's a lot of good information here that you won't be able to get from just magazine articles or summaries of the book.  So if you are going on this diet, it's worth it to get the book.  This diet has a long, proven track record in France.  Thus, if you want another variation of a high-protein diet, read this book.
B0045U9WPU|4.0|I was a little worried about this book when I started because the plot was slow and it immediately went into Lena's appointment for the cure. I was confused until I started getting into it and after about eight chapters, things start getting good and the pace picks up! By the way, the chapters are short and sweet. I felt like Lena has just enought resistance to danger to make the love she finds genuine. The raids provide a good balance of action and drama. There is just enought romance for a YA novel...very tastefully done so readers of all ages can enjoy. I have two teenage girls and found this story very believable. It was well written and very easy to read.
B004G606K8|5.0|As a highschooler of the 80's, I am a bit nostalgic of this era. I listen to the new \\"classic rock\\" and have fond memories. Few memories compete with the pen and paper D&D of the time, however, and the great enjoyment of the bonds and friendships that were forged with the roll of the dice.<br /><br />Weis & Hickman have recreated that with the Dragons of Autumn Twlight part of the Dragonlance Chronicles. This book, based on an actual campaign played with pen and paper and dice, shows its tell tale marks with deftness and grace. I have read this book many times, watched the cartoon version, and read the comic version. It never gets old. There is something about the genuineness (if not always \\"appropriate\\" for the setting) of the interactions, the uniqueness of the setting, and the blatent juvenille attempts at humor (Highbulp Phudge I) that makes this a whimsical trip down memory lane...  at least for me.<br /><br />There are some real human stories here, and the writing is quite good. A lot to be appreciated...<br /><br />Highly recommended!

Some of the scenes, and faces, seemed soft and dull, and that may just be how the movie was made.  Lot's of detail mostly.<br /><br />The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio ES 6.1 Matrix, whatever that means.  Anyway, it was very good to great.  Lot's of surround sound.

1401307787|4.0|I'm grateful that Hyperion came out with a 10th anniversary edition of this book, for a couple of reasons. One, I may very well never have found it in a bookstore in 2011 if not for this \\"new\\" edition. And, two, Kabat-Zinn's afterword for the anniversary edition nicely ties up the book's main concepts.    In the afterword, Kabat-Zinn bricks back our attention to the \\"clarity, sanity, and well-being that are always and already right beneath our noses, and within all of us.\\" A lot of us were probably wondering where we had left our clarity, sanity and well-being.     With this book, Kabat-Zinn doesn't provide a \\"how-to\\" on meditation as much as he describes the context and benefits of meditation. (If you're looking for guided meditation, he sells CDs.)    I was especially impressed that he included two chapters on parenting. Too often, books based on Eastern philosophy seem divorced from the messiness of reality.     The title is more than a catchy restatement of the \\"here and now\\" principle. Kabat-Zinn puts the emphasis on \\"you\\". It doesn't matter where \\"here\\" is. Wherever it is, you're going to be there. So it would behoove you to get your act together, although Kabat-Zinn would never phrase it so indelicately.
B002A9IZ9C|4.0|I've had this flash for a while, and loved it.  For the money it's great.  The zoom is noisy, and the it doesn't feel as solidly built as the 580, but it does what it is supposed to.      I use it with a pocket wizard flextt5/minitt1 system and it doesn't need the extra shielding that my 430ex does.      I did have to send it back after about 6 months (it may have gotten dropped one to many times). Customer service was excellent and they sent me a brand new flash right away.     The battery tray thing is great, I bought a spare one so battery changes take no time at all.    the usb flashable firmware is a great thing, but the directions on how to do it were writen by someone who doesn't speak english.  it took me a few tries to decipher.

1932100660|5.0|I have read this book three times and still pick it up and read a chapter occasionally.   There is no question in my mind that the information in this book would change the health crisis in the US if everyone would read it.  I follow the diet and have no health problems, take no medications, and feel great - I am 48 and my husband is 59 - he follows the diet, too and takes no medications.  This is a wonderful book and I am grateful to people like Dr. Campbell who dedicate their lives to helping people improve their health.
B000VDDWDS|2.0|This movie is so slow and boring it will put you to sleep or make you want to leave the room.I was not entertained by this movie at all.It was a chore to watch it.Reminded me off a movie that they would force you to watch in school.It was painfully long and dull.The plot was bad.The dialog boring.The only good thing about this was was the special effects and costumes.I Can't believe all the good reviews for this movie.Must be some dull and boring people,just like the movie.
0307272702|3.0|I think I read this book before, when it was called Dr Atkins New Diet Revolution.      Why Gary Taubes is getting so much press for espousing the `carbs make you fat' view that's been around for generations, is beyond me.  Maybe it's because he's `one of them', not a doctor or a scientist or an athlete, but the most intelligent of all humans:  a journalist.  And a very liberal, progressive one at that.  He says the right things, like \\"When thinking about a healthy diet, shouldn't we think about what's good for the planet as well as what's good for us?  Do we have a right to kill animals for our food?...these are all important questions that need to be addressed.\\"  And thankfully he absolves everyone of any personal accountability in their weight gain.  If you just had a super-sized Big Mac meal with a side of 10 chicken nuggets and an ice cream cone and 2 pies for dessert, don't worry.  It's not your fault you're fat.  Free will doesn't exist in Taubes' view; you're simply a victim of your biochemistry.    The book is not without its merits, it's well-written and is, in fact, an interesting perspective on diet.  But it's hardly earth-shaking or ground-breaking.  In fact, since Taubes has put this book out it's given me the confidence to release my own investigative work that explains the diversity of life on this earth by small mutations in the genetic code building up over generations.  I call it `evolution.'  Look for it on bookshelves soon.
0316056863|3.0|Although the book was humorous, I didn't find it belly-laughing hysterical, which was what I expected.  The tidbits about SLN and 30 Rock, as well as information about breaking into the comedy world whet my appetite but I wanted more, particularly about SNL.  The cover put me off a bit which probably influenced my opinion of the book.
0553582038|1.0|After watching the first two episodes of the HBO series I was so taken by the story I read all four books and then the fantasy was over with a thud.  This should have been a very incredible trilogy, but has turned into a never ending dribble which has taken way too long to finish.  I am so glad I never read the first book when published in 1996. It took him six years since the publishing of this book to release a fifth book which was suppose to be the other half already written when book four was cut in two, because it was considered too long to publish in one books back SIX years ago.  If that sounds confusing, you now have a clue at how bad this book actually was. The once trilogy is now planned to be a seven book series which most likely won't be completed for another ten years. I did not review the first three books, but this book was such a waste of time I wanted to try and save some poor reader from hours and hours of this maddening dribble.      A Game of Thrones introduced us to wonderful characters, some we hated and some we loved.  A Clash of Kings was quite long winded, but showed building to a great end and incredible battles to come. A Storm of Swords killed off some of the characters we had invested in and left many questions. Lastly, A Feast for Crows did not even have many of the character in it at all and introduces a ton of new characters the series could have left out and been much better for it.  The next book will be out in July and will spend half of its pages getting the forgotten character from book three up to date and the next half of the book dragging on and adding new stories to the mix which will limp on through book six, The Winds of Winter.      It is unbelievable that it took only four years between publishing the first three books and then eleven more years to publish the next two.  At this rate it will be 2020 before the series is finished and many of the original readers of A Game of Thrones will be disinterested or started takingtheir eternal nap by then.    My biggest question is how does HBO expect to finish their series which will run 3-4 years, when the books are still ten years from being completed?  This is what happens when people get more interested in the money they can make, than the product they are producing.  Read at own risk and only if you have hours to waste and ten years to wait.
0756405890|3.0|In accordance with the rest of the reviews... It was a good story & well written.  The reason for my 3 stars:      What was lacking (for me) was the excitement.  There was never a nail biting moment I've experienced in so many other novels.  I ended up reading parts of the book right before bed and rightfully so.  It helped me to relax & inevitably put me to sleep.     I also didn't appreciate the constant reminders that this is \\"real life\\" not some fantasy story.  Thanks for that.  I love going through my day so I can come home and experience someone else's day in the same fashion.      Based on the reviews I've seen, book #2 followed the same kind of drawn out pace with a story line that got worse.  I won't be continuing this series.
0345529057|3.0|Definately a good purchase.  I only gave it three stars because the last book is so horrible.  It is actually quite laughable how good the first three are and how bad the last is.  It was obviously just a ploy to make more money and not push forward the plot.  I will probably get the next book from the library.  Thanks George, you almost had me thinking you were different.

B000RZIGVS|2.0|Just got this set a few days ago and man is this thing cheaply made.  I'm not sure who approved the design of this box but it is extremely low quality. Each green plastic tray contains 2 dvds and all the trays are held together with just 2 strips of packing tape!!! The tray itself is brittle and when i received it many of they had chipped pieces of broken plastic lodged at the bottom of the box.  Some of these pieces were actually lodged between the dvd and the tray thereby damaging the discs....     Many of the discs them selves were severely scratched because of the poor construction of the trays and I would estimate that no less than 70% of all the disc had moderate to heavy scratches on them. Also the discs themselves were of poor quality as there was protruding plastic nubs on the side of many discs where i guess they were left from when the disc was being molded.  I had to physically file down at least 4 discs to avoid damaging my dvd player.      It short this is a overpriced box set that is definitely not worth the money. If your a collector just spend some extra bucks and get a better set.
1932100660|3.0|I gave this 3 stars only becaue of the fact that he wrote about the good of eating your fruits and vegies.  Heck my mom told me that as a small child.  Popeye was vigilant in getting the point across.  We all need to understand that going way too far south or way too far north is going to cause havoc in our bodies.  We have to understand that each and everyone of us is different, we all metabolize foods differently.. I for one cannot eat sugars or white carbs and for that matter any carbs I need to eat in moderation or my inner me gets very angry!!!  Eat a balanced meal, eat in moderation (with all foods) and EXERCISE.  Eat organic and range fed animals if at all possible. And if you are going to rid yourself of something that can and will cause you to get ill.. CUT OUT STRESS, the news and anything negative!!!  That is the leading cause of death of all people regardless of what you stick in your mouth!  Take a deep breath, get back to nature, balance the body and mind and enjoy what you are eating.  Take it from the French they know how to live a healthy happy stres free lifestyle!
B00503BN1M|1.0|I honestly don't understand the good reviews for this movie.  I turned it off after about 20 minutes.  It's a combination of predictable tedium and fifth grade boy crude humor.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|As I haven't read the Deathly Hallows in years and forgot a lot, this movie was a surprise and a reminder.  I actually liked the movie better as the time in the forest seemed to drag forever in the book.  My husband liked the movie too, and wanted to watch it again and he's not read any of the Harry Potter books.
B003LXXEFG|5.0|I have always kinda known about the cure and have heard all there radio hits. But I wasn't really into them until a few months ago. But now I find there music is beautiful masterpieces. This album is a perfect example. I play it on surround sound at night with all the lights out and just zone out on the melody. Its pretty dark. Which I love. I can't really explain totally how I feel about this album. But I know it will never get old to me. I wish I got it sooner.    Ps  I got the mp3 download because I wanted it right then but it is so good I bought the 3 disk special edition. Gotta be one off my top 25 albums ever.

1439152780|5.0|I happened upon a Kate Morton book, quite by accident last year (Forgotten Garden) and was immediately entranced by her story and her writing style. This is her 3rd book and it is just as wonderful as the other two. I am pleased to find such a fresh new author and cannot wait for her next book. Her style is part Daphne DuMaurier and part Carlos Zafon. Enchanting is the best description I can give.
0142418471|3.0|Before reading WG/WG, I  had never read anything by John Green or David Levithan.  A few friends of mine are fans of John Green's, so I decided to give this a try. I enjoyed Green's odd chapters much more than Levithan's even chapters.    PROS: The concept is intriguing. I was hooked from reading the back cover.  I worried that two authors collaborating in such a way (alternating chapters and essentially creating separate books that collide in the middle) was too ambitious, but they pulled it off.  It really works.  John Green's character Tiny is larger-than-life (literally and figuratively).  His Will Grayson is my favorite, because he's a normal kid who struggles with normal issues.  He has a love interest, and  his feelings are so real; even when he's contradicting himself, you know exactly what he's going through.  The ending was good, if a bit cheesy. (OK, so it's a lot cheesy, actually.  It's the kind of ending you'd expect during a season finale of \\"Glee.\\")  Still, it's enjoyable.    CONS: Levithan's WG character is depressing and whiny and just a.w.f.u.l.  It's just tedious and repetitive, and it was just too easy to put the book down when I finished an odd chapter.  I had to make myself read the first 4 even chapters, but then finally (near the middle), it got interesting.  I can see a lot of other readers putting the book down and never reaching the best part, which incidentally happens during the last 4 chapters.    On a side note, I read this book for book club.  We chose it based on the item description.  We were not aware it was an LGBT title until we started reading it.  I wish this was part of the item description.  YA covers a wide area, and there are some parents who might not want their younger teens reading this.  (The language was pretty intense.)  I wish there could be a rating system for YA books similar to movies, so parents can determine if a book is appropriate for their child or not.    Note: The voting buttons are for the review's helpfulness, not whether you agree or disagree with the reviewer's opinion.  It's much more valuable to have well-written reviews that are both critical and high-rating than for everyone to rate the book the same.
B004SBQAL0|2.0|\\"I Am Number Four\\"  is an action science-fiction thriller with an interesting premise.  Number Four (Alex Pettyfer) is an alien whose home planet, Lorien, was destroyed by an evil race of hit men called the Mogadorians.  Four is one of nine Lorien children sent to Earth to escape their planet's destruction.  Legend says that they will eventually gain enough power to vanquish the Modadorians.  So the Mogadorians have tracked them to Earth, intent on wiping out all nine.  One, Two and Three have already been killed.  Four must act quickly and decisively, but first he must hide in plain sight.  How?  By enrolling in his local high school.    This movie is all over the place and far too ambitious.  Sometimes it aspires to be \\"The Matrix,\\" other times \\"The X Files,\\" and still others a John Hughes flick.  Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Combo Pack include a making-of featurette, bloopers, and six deleted scenes.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|The first time I listened, I thought it an average CD (though still one of Gregg Allman's better efforts). But then I sat down and really gave it a listen and it has quickly moved its way up to my top 10 CD's I currently listen to.  I enjoy all the interpretations on the blues covers. I also liked the one original, Just Another Rider, which could have appeared on any Brothers CD.  The horn section on 5 of the cuts is complimentary without being overpowering.  With Dr. John on keys and production by T Bone Burnett, this is one enjoyable stroll through the blues with Gregg leading the way.

0425241505|5.0|When I was sent an ARC of Thea Harrison's Dragon Bound, I'll be honest, I had put it to the side not expecting to read it. I'm not into dragon shift-changing paranormal because the few I've read in the past were lacking for me. I noted the large amount of author blurbs on the cover copy here from J.R. Ward, Christine Feehan, Nalini Singh, among others, and again I just shrugged my shoulders. I'm so glad I read more than a few reviews about Dragon Bound on the various blogs I visit because they were all raving about it. And let me tell you, Dragon Bound is awesome. Thea Harrison will most likely be my favorite debut author of this year. She has taken the paranormal romance genre and fired it up (har har). Dragons are the new in thing, especially alpha, smoldering, protective and possessive dragon men like Thea's Dragos Cuelebre. If you're a fan of Ward, Feehan and Nalini, you'll eat this book up. Thea has written one awesome paranormal with incredible world building, a hero to swoon over and a heroine who's no flakey Mary Sue. Plus, the love scenes are steamy and exactly what I'm looking for in the romances I read. Thea Harrison is one author to watch, and she may give most of her fellow paranormal romance authors a run for their money.<br /><br />Pia Giovanni is a woman on the edge. Because of her ex-boyfriend, she's blackmailed into stealing something from Dragos, the most powerful Wyr in Manhattan, as well as the most dangerous creature on Earth. The Wyrs and other supernatural creatures, otherwise known as the Elder Races, now walk openly among humans. Pia is not human fully human and half Wyr herself who has a skill at picking locks. She has no choice but to do what her nasty ex wants because he has put a spell on her. Plus his associates are very powerful and dangerous and he may have told them about her. Pia takes something very small from Dragos' hoard and because of that she's marked for death. After she hands off this small thing she's stolen, she'll get out of Dodge because if Dragos finds her, he'll flay her skin from her bones.<br /><br />Dragos' lair has never been infiltrated before and when he finds out the thief, who broke through his spells, took one of his precious items, he'll make the thief pay with their life. But when he finds an apology written from the thief on a 7-11 store receipt, he breaks down in laughter, for the thief has stolen a penny and left one in its place. Now Dragos is more than intrigued in finding his thief who made him laugh.<br /><br />Pia is able to escape undetected, or so she thinks. Her boss, Quentin lends her aid and allows her use of his home near Charleston, South Carolina. Dragos can't enter there without the Eleven High Lord's permission, but if he goes ahead without this permission, he'll break the treaties and start a war. Pia soon breathes a sigh of relief and really thinks that Dragos isn't tracking her. But the jig is up and Dragos soon finds Pia regardless of the consequences of his actions. Upon meeting Pia, Dragos doesn't want to kill her, actually far from it. He decides to claim her as his own, much like a possession he keeps in his hoard. Pia takes offense to this, but there's not much she can do. She'll wait until he tires of her and disappears, much like her mother taught her to. Dragos refuses to let Pia out of his sight. But then Dragos is attacked by the Elves and Pia finds out that her ex has been murdered and she may be next. It looks like the Dark Fae King wants Pia because of her magical ability. Dragos won't allow her to be taken and will protect her. But first they have to escape a group of Goblins who caught them and brought them over to the Other land, the place Pia's mother warned her about.<br /><br />Pia and Dragos work together to make it back to Manhattan where Dragos can store Pia safely in his tower. By now Dragos doesn't think of Pia as his thief, but more like his mate.

B004KWVDWI|3.0|\\"Papillon,\\" directed by Franklin J. Schaffner (\\"Patton,\\" \\"Planet of the Apes\\"), is the story of French petty criminal Henri Charriere, known as Papillon (or butterfly) because of a prominent tattoo, who is unjustly convicted of murder and struggles to escape the notorious penal colony of Devil's Island.  Steve McQueen plays Papillon and Dustin Hoffman plays fellow convict Louis Dega, the most famous counterfeiter in France.  Papillon promises to protect Louis in exchange for his help in planning what will be a difficult escape.<br /><br />At 150 minutes, the film would have benefited from tighter editing to cut a few false endings and step up the pace.  What keeps the viewer involved is the unlikely relationship between Papillon, a man of action, and Louis, a bookish intellectual.  And the movie has some fine moments, among them that Papillon's escape involves making his way through a leper colony, relying on disease victims for help.  Another finds the pair atop a cliff on the island with Papillon wondering if a raft made of coconuts might get him through the rough seas.  It's apparent in this scene that the endless ocean, not jail cells or guards, is the real prison.<br /><br />The new Blu-ray edition contains the featurette \\"The Magnificent Rebel\\" and a 32-page Blu-ray Book with background information, archival photos, and an examination of the controversy surrounding the film's accuracy.  Charriere was accused of fabricating parts of his autobiography, on which the script was based.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  Longer would have been good, but this sort of game seems to get quite large with just a limited scope.  More would have been enormous.  The puzzled were entertaining and very clever.  It took be back to the adventure games of the 80s and early 90s, which at the time were my favorite genre.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|This 50th anniversary edition is a must for and fan of the movie, or of Hitchcock in general, and it's even on Blu-Ray!    The book pages and whole set up draws you in and looks beautiful on shelf. Included are many poster pictures and behind the set photos and a synopsis and summery of this amazing movie. There is nothing more you could ask for about this item, but if I was to be picky, I would have made a better menu interface. We all know the power Blu-Ray menus can achieve with time spent working on it.
044654759X|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this novel. The reader sounded like a tired Hilary Swank. At first I was annoyed by it, but then I got use to it and the reader did great!  The story picked up real fast. I do find that Sparks have a problem of overly describing things.  I was very very surprised by the twist in the end!      I think the movie version of this will be great!
0156027321|5.0|Easily The Best Book I've Read in the past 2 years.     When I first starting reading this book I automatically thought \\"Alchemist version 2.0\\".  I was very wrong.   Although there are similarities about religion this is a much more elaborate and captivating story.   The first 60+ pages are kind of drab and hard to get through.   Once the story really begins, I found myself unable to put the book down.    I can not describe how a story so outlandish and fiction felt real and possible. I felt like I was living on the lifeboat with Pi Patel. Which shows how talented and intelligent this author is.     The ending was surprising for me, may be not for some more expert scholars. I was surprised and immediately reflected and went back to the beginning and started the book all over again.     This book was amazing and the story is so rich.    I love this book.

B0041KKYEW|1.0|I think this is one of the most stupid--if not THE most stupid--movies I have ever seen. I fell asleep twice, but since I rented it, thought I would watch it so that I could give an honest critique...and honestly, I am thankful I didn't waste my money at the theater. I should have paid attention to those here who felt the same as I about this stupid movie. It was a waste of time.
039472903X|5.0|Let's face it, Ogilvy made great headway for the advertising industry. I'd even go as far as saying that his advertising methods are among the best the world has ever seen.

The best part about this book has got to be the visual references of some of the most successful ad campaigns since the dawn of advertising.

B000TGJ80S|5.0|I saw this movie when i was a little boy in 1992 and it shocks me. But now i still remember that movie like it was yesterdar and i feel the need to buy it and was a great choice. You see how a real Dracula is born to be and not that lovestory that we see today. Yes. it has his romance but in a dark way, his mistery and gore of course. In my list Bram Stoker Dracula is the best Dracula/vampire movie in history.
B0045HCJKS|4.0|i always loved that movie,i have it as a tape vhs,so i knew that product .this is the reason i bought as a dvd.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Something Borrowed is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! Witty, sophisticated, keeps you locked in and engaged from first to last page, it was such a pleasure to read i was sad it was over. I literally read it in one day, I couldn't put it down. HIGHLY recommended!!!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Not going to bother with the story line. If you have not seen it, I don't want to spoil your viewing experience with bits and pieces of useless details about the film which you will soon find out for yourself.   What I can tell you, however, is that I was completely speechless for about 20 minutes after the final credit rolled off the TV screen. Usually, I hit the stop button even before the first credit comes up when I am done with a movie but... oh no.. not this movie. I was so enervated by the sheer choking death grip of this unapologetic cinema that I couldn't careless about turning off the TV or DVD. I just sat there... dumbfounded.. totally, utterly disturbed and entertained at the same time.  I am sure my mouth was open for the entire time and no sound came out other than occasional f** and s** and several crude English vocabularies deemed unfit for public use by the FCC.   Those of you who have seen it... will agree with me, or at least understand what I mean when I saw the final twist that shook Daesoo Oh to his core and sent him to unmerciful eternal damnation fit for a page out of Dante's Inferno, I unknowingly stood up and yelled at the top of my lungs at the TV screen cussing up a storm. It was a scream for personal salvation as much as highest praise I can bestow on actors and the director of Oldboy.   What did I just see? Can I unsee it? If I close my eyes and pretend that I didn't just see what I saw.. will it go away? Then... a sudden realization hits me... my gosh.. as sick and twisted as it is... this is cinema at its best.  Watch this for cinematic beauty, gripping story telling, flawless or incredibly flawed personalities acted out by gifted actors. Most of all, watch this film because this is a movie Hollywood can only wish it can make.
B000005JA8|4.0|I am a mid-40's fan of classic and modern rock, and enjoy some jazz and classical music as well and was looking for something different to listen to.  Something to de-rut myself and to expand my musical mind and shake things up a bit. I surfed the web and lo and behold it offered up Captain Beefheart and the Trout Mask Replica CD.  It tends to rank pretty well in \\"best of\\" rock album type lists and seems to be pretty polarizing.  I was intrigued and purchased it.      Like many folks the first listening was jarring and my initial thought was \\"what the heck? This is awful!\\"  I gave it another chance though and upon further listening I find this album rather charming. It is a combination of blues, jazz, rock, spoken-word beat-like poetry with a dust bowl ballad kind of ambiance. The music will at times feel familiar, as if it may go in a conventional direction, but it won't. It will turn, twist, contort and will go to crazy places. The most off-putting aspect for me is Captain Beefheart sounds a lot like Wolfman Jack, the disc jockey and TV personality of the 60's and 70's.      So if you are safely cocooned in your likes and dislikes of music and are happy with your trusted bands, don't come near this cause you won't like it.  If you are like me and are looking for something different this may be for you just to shake things up a bit.  And I agree with a review I read somewhere, a negative one I believe, that after listening to TMR you will listen to and appreciate other more \\"conventional\\" music even more.  This was meant as a put down but I believe it is a compliment.  Everything sounds different to me now since I listened to TMR.  So give TMR a try if you are in a musical rut or are feeling adventurous.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|For a rental movie this one is in great condition absolutely no scratches, plays flawlessly, and arrived at my door in record time.    I loved this movie on the big screen and it is good on my 32\\" wide screen.  Those with smaller sets will miss the awesome detail; those with bigger screens - Lucky You!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|I bought this after catching a few minutes of it on TV. Sin City is now on my list of all time favorites. The editing, filming techniques are, in my opinion, nothing short of phenomenal. If you get the chance to see the green screen and director's versions, do so. The directors choices, over and over again, are amazing. Being in the industry, I look at films in terms of editing, score, directing, etc. Still and all, a great piece. I very highly recommend it.
0375842209|5.0|Mark Zusak has written a truly unique and fascinating book. The narrator, Death, provides intriguing perspectives; for instance he first interprets a scene in the world depending on its surrounding colors. Death also inserts foreshadowing often throughout the book to help keep the reader interested. In the very last line of the book, Death states, \\"I am haunted by humans\\" (page 550). Although Death is not a human, for he cannot communicate with people on the earth, he seems to have human emotions such as sadness and fear shown in this excerpt. His job is an extremely difficult and depressing task. Death feels in order to cope with his job, he needs to preoccupy himself by reading and re-telling the stories of courageous and interesting humans. The main character, Leisel, is one of these people. When she was a young girl, she and brother were sent to live with foster guardians because their parents could not take care of them. During the train ride to Molching, Leisel's brother, Werner got sick and passed away. After Leisel buried him, Leisel discovered a book and decided to steal it. After she became acquainted with her loving new foster parents, she began to steal more books and eventually had fourteen. The mayor's wife gave Leisel a book with blank pages, so she began to write her own novel which she titled The Book Thief. One day, her house was bombed. She survived, but the book was thrown into a garbage bin where Death picked it up, read it, and told her story.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I was not familiar with the watchmen series of comics, but I was very interested in this movie when it first came out.  When I finally got to see it I really enjoyed the different characters, and the story.  I highly would recommend this to those who really enjoy the comic book heroes turned into movies.  The director's cut has a more complete version that I enjoyed.
B001AQR3JY|4.0|After reading the reviews on the Platinum Edition Lion King and seeing it wasnt the original I decided to call Disney and ask them about the upcoming DVD release of the movie. What they told me was this :\\"The upcoming release of The Lion King (Diamond Edition) will be the exact same movie as the Platinum Edition. The Blu-ray edition will be a better picture quality simply because of the blu-ray format but there has been no remastering or enhancement of the regular dvd film. Other than extra features on the DVD/blu-ray there is absolutely no difference between the Platinum Edition Lion King DVD and the Upcoming release of The Lion King\\"    Sorry guys but if you were hoping this one would be the original and not what a lot of you claim to be a chopped up and redrawn piece of crap looks like youre out of luck.     Personally I have no problem with the platinum edition.
B003UESJF6|5.0|I was very surprised to watch one of few animated films that are so very entertaining.  The characters were great, the story, and  the plot were really well executed to make this a very  well done movie.  The whole family enjoyed it. A future classic.  Highly recommended.
0061928356|1.0|Most of the previous reviewers have focused on the book's subject matter.  This book's subject matter is extremely compelling.  There is also overwhelming public interest in adoption, sex-selective abortion, and Indian culture.  However, this book is meant to be a novel and, in that sense, it is a complete failure.      The characters are superficially drawn with little insight into their motivation or emotion.  As readers, we are never allowed to feel anything unless Gowda tells us to feel it.  Each chapter is too short to give us a true sense of any of these characters.  There is little incentive to care about how things work out for them.  The dialogue is stilted, with Indian words peppered throughout.  In the case of the English-speaking characters, this might have worked, but the Indian-speaking characters' dialogue is written in the same way.      The descriptions range from bland to clinical to silly.  There is no reason to include many of the details in the book.  Hair removal techniques, cute multilingual boys, and hippies with Indian spirit names only bolster the book's superficial air.  The characters' ignorance and insensitivity regarding each other's cultures was unbelievable; nobody is as oblivious as these cardboard characters!      I walked away feeling annoyed and unsatisfied.  I couldn't have possibly cared less about these characters or what happened to them.  This isn't a good book about international adoption because this isn't a good book.
B003VA3JUO|5.0|Excellent horror style movie with a twist ending. Would recomend to those love stories with a surprise at the end.  Well done, and good acting.  Classic style ghost haunting with a little girl that helps clear up the mystery on board.  I was very entertained by this movie, and found it enjoyable.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I never watched Modern Family until this past Sunday afternoon, then I started watching it and finished every single episode that's been released so far (42+) by Wednesday. Yes, it's that good.  This show is hilarious,the characters are lovable (and even relate-able to some extent). The lines are great and it's clean for the most part (good for the family). I had a blast watching every one of the episodes. And as funny as it is, there are great principles about family, sharing, relationships, etc. in it too, though that is not necessarily what people watch it for.  It's a little like The Office in that the camera sometimes cuts away to a scene with just one or two of the characters talking to the camera, sharing their true thoughts and feelings. Modern Family also takes advantage of using awkward situations like The Office. I love both.  I'd definitely recommend this TV show if you've never watched it before, you can check out a couple of episodes on Hulu first.
B00028HBKM|4.0|Straight up, this movie was one of the best I've ever seen. As a fairly new Christian, seeing this movie put into perspective just what my sins REALLY mean. It's probably not the best for someone with a weak stomach though - there are some pretty violent scenes. But, if you want to understand what it meant for Jesus to die for your sins, this is a great movie to watch.<br />My only issue with the movie was that the characters don't speak English. They speak Latin. The good/bad news is that there are subtitles so that you know what they are saying, but it is a bit annoying to have to read so many subtitles during the movie. But, that's not that big a deal, there aren't enough to make you miss what's going on.<br />Overall a great movie though. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is a born-again Christian or even to someone who isn't but is curious about Jesus's crucifixion.
014241543X|5.0|I read this book in 2 days through many tears, but what a touching story.  Great read.  I just started the follow up \\"Where She Went\\"
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|if band of brothers is a 10, this movie is a 3.5. first, i just finished the first four hours, so i will give updated post after next six hours are done. doesnt' show any leadership. no tactics. way too much nudity for a war flick and the f word is used every 30 seconds. really hard to watch while my wife was in the room.<br /><br />the battle scenes seem to be mainly at night. can only see flashes of light, but the sound track is good to great. in fist four hours there was more sex scenes and female relationship scenes than battle scenes. also in first four hours: one guy commits suicid, guy bare hand strangles someone, a LT steals one of his men's gun, hero visit nut house, about 40 minutes of female male relationship scenens. oh ya, there was a \\"bootcamp\\" scene of dudes learning to fire off morters (it lasted about 30 seconds).<br /><br />i bought the blu-ray. extra historical info is cool. color is good, sound is good, but this movie is not worth 50 bucks. wait for it to come on histroy channel and tivo it. atleast maybe the x ratedness might be cleaned up a bit.<br /><br />Well it's been about a year and half, finished about two more hours the Gaudalcanal was very intense fight scene.<br /><br />Well, have no need to rewatch any scenes. but i have rewatched several scenes of band of brothers.<br /><br />again do not spend a nickel on this movie. wait for made for tv edition, or borrow from buddy.
B004L49K20|4.0|So nice to have an album, especially with 15 tracks, that is great from start to finish. I love Duran Duran, so enthusiasts don't hate on me, but their albums usually suffer from having a few good singles with a lot of filler....not this album. Any one of these songs could be a strong single and as a whole it rocks! I've had this on constant rotation in my iPod for 2 months now
B000002GYG|5.0|I hadn't listened to this album in over a decade. On the first hearing, I realized I hadn't forgotten a word.  Waits' music and humor are at the top.
B004IQMXD4|4.0|She's come back with a great album that actually gets stronger as the songs progress. We've all heard those albums where the first few songs are the best ones on the album and the remainder are filler. I'm sitting here listening to In Your Dreams in its entirety and so impressed with how each song not only segues beautifully to the next but how the songs actually get better as they go. Not to say I don't like the first few but I actually think the album is stronger towards the 2nd half. Amazing Stevie - so nice to have you back!!
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|I was so moved by this story. We often perceive celebrities of this status to be plastic, perfect, almost not human. This book journals the emotional battle fought internally while the outside world laps up and adores the facade. A human story of a real person who's self worth was determined by the superficial opinions of others. I praise Portia's honesty and thank her for bearing her soul. This would have been such a challenge for a clearly private and shy person.
B002XMGJHG|4.0|This is the second album by Europe, on a remastered CD.  Europe would of course achieve their big breakthrough in 1984 with their AOR-oriented third album, The Final Countdown.  By comparison, Wings of Tomorrow (1982) is much more of a hard rock effort.  Still, it contains some fine songs, which hold up very well almost three decades later.  Lead singer / songwriter Joey Tempest had an intuitive gift for melody, which really comes through on this album.  The title track, along with Storm Wind and Scream of Anger are the most metallic songs, and feature powerful guitar work by John Norum.  Some of the others are a bit slower, but still very engaging.  This is an underrated CD.  The only caveat is that at nine songs and one short instrumental, it runs only 38 minutes.  Of the two editions that are currently available, the mastering on the UK version is superior, and closer to the original sound.
B00006GA48|5.0|This happens to be one of my all-time favorite cd's of all time. Just about every song is good. These guys have to be one of the greatest power trio's of all time. All-in-all this is one great cd.
B004XUD762|5.0|If your a BLS or Zakk Wylde fan this is a solid effort and a must have for the fans of his acoustic work, These are not just Acoustic redo's of the OOTB album, these are completely different arrangements and are very well done.
0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key is a riveting and compelling novel. The Holocaust was always a time in history that has intrigued me. It's always been a topic that I can never get tired of learning from. Reading about the pain that humans were put through, the inhuman acts of treating them like life-less souls, separating families in a blink of an eye to never be reunited again - it tears my hearts to shreds. It's the fact that actual human beings were doing this to one another that really irritates me, angers me, but at the same time the only thing we can do is to never forget, to hold all those poor souls that lost their lives way to young in our thoughts & hearts, and pray that we never go through such a time again.     Sarah's Key was a novel that I couldn't put down. Every page was more interesting than the last. The way that the novel went from the past tense to the present with a turn of a page was a very interesting and captivating way of telling the story. Reading what Sarah had to go through and see at such a young age was heart wrenching. No child ever should be forced to grow up so fast and make the decisions and things that she had to do. (Spoiler alert) It's a story that really demonstrates how tragic things can really alter the lives of so many people...and how loss can hurt so much that the only way to console your pain is to take your own life.     The other interesting thing about the book was how it was told from a perspective that we don't really think about when studying the Holocaust. I was surprised to find that the French soldiers were the ones doing all the round ups. I never knew this. It's not often that one can learn from a novel while it still remaining interesting.     Overall, a great read and it's highly recommended.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Every thinking American needs to watch this documentary.  It explains what caused the financial meltdown in very clear and simple terms.  It does not favor one political party over the other, but instead shows that both parties involved.
0062060554|4.0|This was a very interesting book that was very hard to put down- but I felt a little misled as for 98% of the book it was not much of a \\"thriller\\". However, it was quite interesting and kept you guessing till the end. You can't help but feel and root for Christine as she fights to remember who she is day to day. The book is very well written and the story line and characters are well developed- I greatly enjoyed this novel and I recommend it to people who like mysteries.
B00479SVBU|2.0|Having a player/transmitter all in one is helpful, as no separate MP3 player is required. However, this unit simply did not operate properly. When it worked it was great, but it frequently skipped small portions of songs, or spontaneously jumped to another song. This was not consistent: the same song would play fine once, then would abort the next time. Worse, the player would get 'stuck' on certain songs: it would freeze, and could not be rebooted even by powering down and removing the SD card. This all occurred on digital files that play fine on a Sansa MP3 player.    The directions that come with the player are laughable, obviously written by someone for whom English is a second or third language.

B004YD1KTO|4.0|There's a familiar touch to Afterwards that will certainly please readers of Rosamund Lupton's successful debut [[ASIN:0307716511 Sister]], the author again finding an original way to relate a crime incident while at the same time delving deeply into specifically female issues relating to the family, nurturing and protectiveness.  There's a danger, particularly since not everyone was convinced by the narrative twist of the first book (I thought it was great) that the author is retreading over familiar ground and just pulling a similar trick over again - this book could just as easily been called Mother.  The measure of the book however is again in how successfully it allows the author to get to the emotional core of the subject, and Afterwards does that very well indeed.    Whenever such issues relating to family come up in a crime bestseller, they usually stick to a fairly standard template of parental neglect, alcoholism and abuse, or they go for the emotional button-pushing of the kidnapped innocent child.  There are other ways of dealing with the everyday concerns and connections that exist between a mother and her children, but it's true, they aren't usually quite as exciting as the blockbuster treatment.  In Afterwards however the author comes up with a thrilling twist to show the deep concerns that one mother, Grace Covey, has for her two children.  In a variation on the Sunset Boulevard opening (where a man lying dead in a swimming pool narrates the circumstances leading up to his death), Afterwards opens with Grace Covey in a hospital bed, in a coma, injured while trying to rescue her 17 year-old daughter from a fire that has burned down the school during a sports day.  Grace follows what is happening through an 'out of body' experience, and learns that the burning of the building may have been a deliberate attempt to kill her daughter.    The narrative twist might not work quite so well this time around for some, feeling a little more manipulative in its tone, Grace's motherly instincts coming across just a little bit over-solicitous and middle-class mumsy, but she does at least have good reason for her concerns and the narrative device makes it work.  The 'out of body' experience allows those concerns to be expressed in a much more personal way, touching on the whole range of niggling voices, insecurities and fears of a mother in a compelling and sympathetic manner.  As a result Afterwards manages, after Sister, to be another incredibly tense and suspenseful thriller, the whodunit element handled expertly through an unusual narrative perspective that nonetheless does not feel as manufactured as most thrillers of this type.  It also carries within it a real, powerful emotional core with a punch at the end that will literally leave you gasping for breath.
1594202842|3.0|I dont think that this book will resolve the discussion on whether the Chinese versus Western parenting approach produces better corporate citizens, high achieving adults and well-balanced people. The writer learns that although she cannot ultimately control her youngest daughter, who rejects the musical focus her mother has selected for her, she has ingrained in her daughter a work ethic that will serve her well for any endeavour she undertakes.     Living in Asia, I can see evidence of this work ethic in Chinese (and Japanese) employees. But what she doesnt know how to teach her daughters is that working hard is not the same as working smart. Perhaps she should have made fewer decisions for them, and allowed them to learn how to think!
B002ZG983M|1.0|There's a reason this movie bombed at the box-office and was dubbed a major disappoinment--it SUCKS.  Mostly boring; in fact I couldn't believe how boring most of it was.  Lame \\"hero\\" (Kick-Ass) who does hardly anything and who you totally don't care about in anyway.  A sterotypical ethnic \\"goomba\\" type mobster badguy who was SO sterotypical with his sterotypical henchmen they were like a bad joke.  Barely any real \\"story,\\" and the thin thread of a story that there is is something you've see a billion times before--nerd likes hot girl, nerd \\"kicks-ass\\" and gets hot girl (yawn... are we asleep yet?).  The only half-way decent thing about the entire drivel was Hit-Girl and Big Daddy.  THEY were who the movie SHOULD have been about, but alas, the retarded film-makers made them nothing but nominal back-up characters who barely enter the story until the last act.  Bottom line, if you expect this to be a good movie, sorry, it isn't.  It's LAME-ASS.

0884271536|3.0|The book is certainly helpful, but one has to wade through a lot of long-winded storytelling to get there.  I wish it were more direct and concise, and not written in a novella form.  I've seen summaries online for free that thoroughly explain what he's saying in just a few pages, including very clear and specific diagrams of projects, showing tasks and slack, and explaining exactly what he's saying.
B0034G4P80|4.0|When I first heard that the comic-book Thor was in line for cinematic treatment, I shuddered to think how truly awful that film would be. I assumed it would be hokey beyond compare, as the comic itself often is, and the announcement of Kenneth Branagh as director mollified my fears only slightly. So I was beyond pleased to see a film that actually took itself seriously, rose above its source material and gave us a story -- with all-around good performances from the cast -- that we could believe in.<br /><br />It's a shame, then, that the overall success had to be marred by an overabundance of cheesy special effects and a 3D transference that distracted more than it improved. From the start -- after a brief prelude that gave us a touch of humanity -- the movie presented well the arrogance of Thor, the nobility of Odin and the secretiveness of Loki ... and it looked more like a video game than a film. And it was good -- if I was talking about a video game, I'm be impressed and singing its praises. But as a movie -- the look was disappointing.<br /><br />For our pan-dimensional Norse gods, the beginning of the movie involves a host of fighting on a very large scale. First, there's a war on Earth, then Thor's ill-conceived journey to Jotunheim, with six gods against the full might of the frost giants. Then Thor (Chris Hemsworth, who's been working out since his memorable appearance on Star Trek) oversteps his bounds and is hurled to Earth for his hubris -- stripped of his powers and his magical hammer Mjolnir -- to learn humility. Then Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is incapacitated, leaving his dark son Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to rule in his place. And Loki, who was second choice to succeed the All-Father, wants to be sure Thor is never coming home.<br /><br />Meanwhile, on Earth, Thor makes the abrupt, bruising acquaintance of astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her storm-chasing team, Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). But when mystical hammers fall from the sky and imbed themselves, Excalibur-like, in the rock, you can be sure government spooks will soon be involved. Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) follows up his abrupt departure from Iron Man 2 to lead the operation here. He probably wasn't expecting to encounter a mindless Norse simulacrum that belches flame.<br /><br />Hemsworth has the difficult task of embodying a diety, and he handles the arrogance and power of his position well. Some might think he adapts to well and to easily to the modern human world he finds himself in, but I guess some guys will do just about anything for Portman. Sadly, although she too displays her usual skill, the romance between them feels flat, motivated by little more than, well, they're both hot, they're both there and there's no much else to do in a small New Mexico town.<br /><br />Back in Asgard, Hiddleston plays Loki as cooly, deliciously evil. But the big battle we all know is coming at the end looks and feels fake. Again, we're back to Thor's video-game world, and it throws the audience right out of the film.<br /><br />All in all, Thor succeeds more when it's working on a human level -- less flash, more substance. Still, the movie works simply because it's fun, and sometimes that's all you need in a comic-book movie. Score another one for Marvel.<br /><br />by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.(net) guysky and imbed themselves, Excalibur-like, in the rock, you can be sure government spooks will soon be involved.

1416550550|5.0|I loved this book.  Every character was well defined so that you knew where you were and with whom.  It was mainly about a little girl who was left on board a ship bound for America from England.  She was to wait for the \\"teacher\\" to return.  She never returned and the little girl sailed to America herself with a little white suitcase containing a few clothes and a fairy tale book.      On arrival, the dock keeper found her and took her home to raise and would not tell her of the circumstances until she was of age.  He had named her Nan and she was devastated when she learned the truth.  She was left a cottage in England and sailed there to find out about it and herself.  She left the cottage to her grandaughter, Susanna, who carried out what Nan herself never accomplished.  Who was she and where did she come from.      I would love to tell you the whole story but I don't want to give anything away.  All my friends, family and reading group have read this book and loved it.  Read it and enjoy!
B004G6009U|5.0|They hit this one out of the park! And not to mention the music reminds me back to the good ol days when disney movies had great music such as beauty and the beast and little mermaid! GREAT MOVIE WHATCH IT<
B0042J6VUS|5.0|This thing is GREAT!! It arrived a couple of days prior to leaving for a trip for a week. I had planned on using my IPod touch to record video and this came through just fine. It allowed me to use my IPod with a full size tripod, as it has a screw hole for the normal tripod mounts. I couldn't be happier.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|Hot guys doing magic, its every girls dream. But for the average movie buff i'll be simple, the movie is differnet and fun. Its dark, has action, romance, and suspense; which makes for a great movie.  Product arrived by set date in great condition, movie was a blast from the past and I love re-watching it. A highly recommended film.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|If you've seen the three films in the title of this review (and they are all better films than Black Swan BTW) then you've seen Black Swan.  So we remove points for originality right off the top.  Deduct more points for pervasive and corny CGI effects (want to see excellent use of CGI?  See Gaspar Noe's Irreversible).  More points removed for the underwhelming acting by Natalie Portman.  Uggh... the Academy rarely gets best actress right and this year is no exception.  We'll also deduct points for Hollywood's liberal (pun intended) use of female masturbation, girl on girl, instructor on girl,  girl on... well you get the idea. All in all we've got no points left to deduct and so much more bad movie to cover.  So we'll leave it at that.  Darren Aronofsky had made two great films... Requiem for a Dream and the Wrestler.  But this is not a great film.  It's not even a good film.  It's an over the top and convoluted mess.  Hell even the ending was bad.
0743270754|5.0|First, I need to say that I may think twice before reading a 750 page book again....but, in retrospect, as you will see, I'm glad I did.      There will not be, and there cannot be, due to our system, another President like Lincoln.  This is a wonderfully detailed, amazingly researched book about his life and times, and conveys many important messages about the man, and why he succeeded during one of the worst times in our Nation's history.  The title is one of the lessons.  He readily included anyone who was the best and brightest into his administration, including those who had been his political opponents.  I could not help but think that the closest we have gotten to that recently is Pres. Obama including Hillary Clinton in his cabinet.  He was also an amazingly forgiving and tolerant man, but also very deep, and extremely caring, a man who was tortured over the decisions he needed to make.  He made those decisions though decisively and courageously.  He had decided about WHETHER to issue the Emancipation Proclamation on his own, but he sought the counsel of his Cabinet on the wording and content.    The stories of the personalities, particularly Seward (never knew of him for anything but Alaska), Salmon Chase, Edwin Bates, and others, including Mary Lincoln ( a very complex portrayal) are beautifully told, as are the amazing details about the operation of the Government at that time.    Enough....if you love history, read this book!

B000001GRE|5.0|There have been several great performances of Mahler's 7th symphony by Bernstein and Thomas among others, but Boulez delivers one of the best performances available on disc. Many conductors record this work simply because its part of the symphony cycle and tend to give it less than stellar performances, but Boulez takes the time to bring out the best of both the Cleveland Orchestra and the music, delivering an outstanding performance of an often overlooked or under appreciated work.

B004QMW1NM|4.0|I've been looking for a new band for a while now and this is by far the best album I've bought in a long while.  I would describe them as blend between Snow Patrol, Mates of the State, and Passion Pit.  Very good album, songs are catchy, lyrics have depth and meaning but are not extraordinary.  Energetic, fun, emotional.
B000000W5B|5.0|While I'm not overly impressed by the sonic quality of this \\"new\\" remaster,  it rocks at a good pace.  Sound is quite acceptable.  As others mentioned,  it's hit and miss with the \\"pussy\\" issue on \\"Star Star.\\"  I just bought the disc last week and it contains the unedited version.      Too many gems and flat out rockers on this effort to dismiss.  While \\"Angie\\" is considered the diamond,  \\"Winter\\" is one of the best Glimmer Twins tracks ever.    DEFINITELY worth the price of admission.

6305320802|5.0|This is one of the all time great musicals and the DVD makes it so much easier to enjoy time and time again.  The music is excellent and very singable.  The only part I don't enjoy is the weird dream scene.  Most of the old musicals have a long dance scene but this one is just strange.  With the DVD I can jump right over it and not miss a thing!
0783226004|3.0|Sneakers is a tense, well-done thriller with a flawed premise: there could exist a single box that would allow the owner to run the world.  Robert Redford, looking older than he is, teams with an very good cast including Ben Kingsley, Dan Akyroyd, River Phoenix, James Earl Jones and a host of other familiar faces to take this little box (that looks remarkably like an 80s-era answering machine) from Kingsley.<br /><br />The fun in the movie is the planning of the heist, complete with a phony computer date and rather easy surveillance of a top-secret facility.  Of course, things go awry in the heist, and much tension arises.<br /><br />All in all, a good but not a great film.  It gets more unbelievable as it goes on, which detracts from the over-all fun of the film.  And, of course, the Republican party gets bashed in the end.
0321647440|1.0|This program is robotic and hard to get with.  It is, to me, unimaginative, dogged and useless.  I am sure it has great value for a real professional photographer, one who SELLS his pictures, but it is not for the rest of us.  Admittedly this Aperture program is unusually difficult to master, but with the help of Apple's one to one people I'm getting there.  But I would advise anyone who is not a pro to seek something more down to earth--not to mention less expensive.

B00009XITP|4.0|A girl wants a father because he is irreplaceable (so are mums). I think everyone should have an extraordinary father like my dad. I also thought all the actors and actresses were wonderful. They play some really nice songs in this film. One of my absolute favourites is Have I Told You Lately by Matt Acheson and it fits the scene in which it was played so well. It's one of the best scenes you'll ever watch, if not the best. Another is You Get Me and it's also good for the scene, too, which is also wonderful--Daphne on a date with her boyfriend. How very lovely. There's also a song her boyfriend sings in a party (before a James Brown song). It's called Long Time Coming. Anyway, the guy really sang it so beautifully. Look out for the scene where he and Daphne have their first kiss 'cause it's so romantic. I also love the scene where Colin's character calls her mum to complain about Daphne 's absence, the father-daughter dance, but these aren't the only wonderful scenes. Just do yourself a favour and watch it. You'll be glad that you did. The characters are believable. This is good to watch with your family. Definitely get a copy.

B00005JMXX|5.0|I'll be honest, I watch this movie because of Jake Gyllenhaal. He got a part that suits him really well. His character is terrific because he's a handsome, intelligent, shy gentleman who behaves like someone who has good upbringing, and he is in love with his friend. He spends most of the film trying to get her. Jake's character has a good relationship with his parents. And his character treats the African lady with respect, which is rare seeing as how Africa and Africans are often portrayed as being primitive on TV and in movies. It's also about global warming, which is a very serious issue.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|\\"Dr. Quinn\\" was on the air when I was in elementary school and I remember watching it occasionally with my family. When it came out on DVD, I was hoping to buy the seasons in stores but the prices were way too high. A few years later I started checking the DVD's out from the library, and decided I really wanted to own these. So I came to look at Amazon.    For 42 discs, the price was very reasonable. I was a little nervous to buy the product after reading the reviews about poor sound and picture quality, but I figured if the product wasn't good I could return it and get my money back.    It's been over four months since I bought it, and I watched the whole series and am currently watching it again. For overall quality, I give it a 99%. There wasn't anything wrong with the picture quality, and the sound quality was excellent except for on two discs in Season 6. There is one episode on each of those discs where a distinct popping sound can be heard. It isn't throughout both episodes, though, just on certain parts. It is kind of annoying but it doesn't prevent you from hearing the dialogue.    I still give the product five stars because other than what I just mentioned, this series is perfect! 42 discs with each season in its own case. All the cases are stored in one box with the Dr. Quinn movies (Yes, they are included! Don't order them separately!)    If you love this show, I highly recommend you check out this product.

B00062IDCO|2.0|I ordered this item with the understanding that it would be new.  Two of the discs skip during at least one episode and it looks like a copy that was made, but advertised as \\"new.\\" I have purchased all 7 seasons from Amazon.com sellers and with the exception of one other season, all of the rest came in factory sealed boxes and contained the original discs. A bit disappointed that I paid the same amount for this as I did for the others and got a lesser product.
0756404738|5.0|Book 1, The Name of the Wind, was an accidental find.  The best new fantasy I'd read in YEARS.  Then came the wait for Book 2.  Waiting was worth it.  Book 2 takes us immediately back into the story and I only stopped reading when I was done.  The only thing better than finding Rothfuss books now, would be discovering them in a few years when the series is complete so I wouldn't have to wait to read them.
B004ZISVRW|5.0|i don't know much about trolls but i'm glad to see they eat christians.  and they may or may not be supremely enraged by muslims.  not for the religious faint of heart, but it is also encouraging to see trolls portrayed compassionately and suffering the same maladies (sickness, hunger, gas) that make us mammals so that we are genuinely left to wonder if the remaining trolls will be ok.
B004FOA84A|2.0|SO MANY FLAWS!  I liked it at first, then it started having obvious flaws. The first being that it is way to short, I beat the game in a little over an hour. If you ever played the Myst series you wont have any trouble doing it either.  This is just a complaint first &quot;the study&quot; was a pain to get to, but not a flaw really just a design choice I didn't like.   The final puzzle needs a separate button for submitting cause I think putting the submit click in the move isn't a good choice.   So design flaw:  THE RESET BUTTON - between the menu button and the sound fx! Yeah hit that on the last puzzle. Trying to turn off the sound, because there wasn't a CONFIRM RESET. It's a simple statement that it's surprising a developer could overlook.    Actual Bugs  If you get one keys then the cube without using the key the cube will over write it. You have to reset.   It you put the cube in the fire before anything else the object inside will disappear. You have to reset.   If you select the back button on the final puzzle it resets the puzzle.

B004QITJC2|5.0|It was a pleasant suprise for me to find out that this album was being released, being a fan of NWOBHM and obscure metal. I got this for the demos, but was actually impressed by the new renditions. This may seem blasphemous to rapbid Hell fans but I find that David Bower is more listenable (better) sounding than the deceased David Halliday. To those who don't know much about this band, David Halliday sort of sounded like a more theatric,heavy metal version of Jello Biafra (Dead Kennedy's). (I like DK by the way so it wasn't much of an issue) However, this sort of voice can get to you after a while (see the intro to Macbeth(demo version). David Bower still has the range of Halliday and the vocal theatrics but it's a little less wildly hysterical,(more contained). The music sounds great and seems to be without (for the most part) that tin drum and muddy guitar sound that plagues every currant metal release I've heard. Also, no weird video game noise guitar solo's! They are all good and well arranged. My hope is that this release get's Kev Bower to reform Paralex and give their demo's and the great White Lightning e.p. the reissue treatment. Other's will also find it no suprise after one listen that David Halliday taught Andy Sneap to play guitar and that Hell was a major influence on Sabbat(UK). It's safe to say to those still unsure if this is a release you want, if you like Mercyful Fate/King Diamond you will like this. As far as the demo's just throw in some Jello Biafra and 80's synth sounds to the mix and you get an idea of what your getting into.
0743454537|1.0|The author starts out with an excellent premise. She makes the reader take a closer look at decisions and the ethical problems they raise based on advancements in technology.  Unfortunately, she reverts to a convoluted plot to show the reader that \\"Mother Knows Best,\\" and that life sucks, and then you die.  The ending comes so forcefully, the reader cannot believe what happened.  It is true that we lose people suddenly in our lives, and the shock value is much the same as how it happens in the book, but the whole story is lost in the ending.  What starts out as a quest for pursuit of personal rights, ends up as a very sad commentary on life.  Perhaps that's what the author wanted to do.....  This was the first book I read by Jodi Picoult, and it will be the last book of hers that I will ever read.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I rarely write reviews.  I figure there are plenty of folks that do and who cares what I have to say?  But this is one product that definitely needs to be mentioned.  I needed (er, wanted) to update a computer and the cost of the 920/960 cpus were so close in price I thought why not try out the Sandy Bridge?  Granted, it required me to update my motherboard too but, computers don't live forever right? ;-)    So, why all the fuss?  First of all, forget using the stock cooler.  I reused a Cooler Master Gemini IIs cooler from the previous i7/960 build I was replacing.  When I got it all back together, MB,CPU and RAM (new), boot drive, PS and case (reused) along with the cooler it powered on 1st time.  After updating the new MB drivers I ran the Windows experience and went from/to:    Processor 7.6 / 7.8  RAM       7.6 / 7.8  Graphics  7.2 / 7.4  Gaming    7.2 / 7.4  HD        6.9 / 6.9    So, not a HUGE jump coming from a 960(still plenty of good initial benchmarks) but the kicker is this runs (with the exact same cooler)11c cooler!  Previously, @ idle it would sit around 50c.  I have been running this overnight and it is currently at @20% usage and barely hits high 40s in a room that is 25c/77f.     I am still in the process of running other benchmarks but for the price this CPU gets it done.    [[ASIN:B004EBUXSA Intel Core i7 Processor i7-2600K 3.4GHz 8MB LGA1155 CPU BX80623I72600K]]

B003L1ZXCU|5.0|I enjoyed this series, Daemon and then Freedom.  I pretty much sat down and devoured them both.  Another review said, most Crichtonesque book since Crichton.  In retrospect I have to agree.  I loved Michael Crichton's writing style, and I think Daniel Suarez does a great job with tone, speed, and story.

0345446798|5.0|I cannot say enough positive things about this book. The author is clearly an expert in her field. She holds degrees in psychology, zoology and ethology. She has been an applied animal behaviorist and a dog trainer. Plus she used dogs to herd her own sheep and has entered them in contests. Her insights are backed up with an exhaustive amount of research. Her approach is calm and patient and loving. There are times I would not want to finish the book, thinking to myself, \\"Oh I think I have understood it all\\" but then I pick up where I left off, still amazed that there was more to discover. In fact I copied the entire chapter on dominance and mailed it to four of my down-owning friends. If you only read one book on dog ownership, MAKE IT THIS ONE!

B000P0J09C|5.0|This is a non-conventional war movie and it happens to be the ONLY war movie I like.  It's more of an artsy type war movie but that's what I like about it.  The acting is fantastic and the battle sequence towards the end of the movie keeps you gripping with fear.
B003L77GG0|1.0|I used to like watching this series early on, when it had stories in it, before the endless sad futility of the Lana Lang romance wore me out... Thought I'd give this last season a try, see if it all came to anything. And what I found was a travesty. Whole episodes seem to consist of characters pretentiously declaiming abstract profundities like, \\"In order to live in the present, I need to let go of the past, dad. That means I have to say goodbye to you.\\" It seems as if the whole story is taking place on some level of vapid commentary. They forgot to invent action - actual plotlines - that would convey these trite messages and make them fresh. It's like a clinic in what Henry James said not to do when he advised authors to show, not tell. The finale goes even farther, with Clark realizing that he shouldn't have let go of the past after all, because although his strength comes from Krypton, his heroic traits come from the Kent family farm. Only this message isn't dramatized -- nothing happens that would make the viewer realize it as lived truth -- instead it is rammed down our throats in the form of...words. We don't need characters saying things like,\\"A hero can only be as strong as his enemies, so that's why I, Lex Luthor, am here.\\" That is supposed to be the job of commentators and critics, who unearth such insights from a good story. But these modern protagonists insist on bloviating about their own significance. The rest of the story is either really bad science fiction or really generic soap opera, and the performances are the same. Some talented actors are dragged down by the lines they must speak. The splendid Erica Durance is turned into a sappy one-dimensional poster girl for faithfulness and fairy tale marriage; the mischievous Alison Mack barely rises above her Spielberg-like bedtime story scene; and it's hard to tell if Tom Welling can act, but he comes off as irretrievably stiff and not too bright, and doesn't look facially anything like any Superman we've ever seen in comics. If you like watching people make speeches about the deep meaning of life instead of embodying it, you'll love Smallville Season 10. All moral, no story.
B001W79MB8|5.0|i hardly ever buy movies without knowing anything about them but i did it with this one based on some reviews.  boy am i impressed, this was a great movie.  ive just really started getting into anime and if i had seen this movie when it first came out i would have gotten into it a few years ago.  the only bad thing about this movie is it sets the bar really high for the rest.  i dont really think there are a whole lot of anime movies out there that will match it.  i hope im proven wrong because i would love to get into more movies put together so well. the art was one of the best ive seen so far, the story was very good ( just woulda like to see no name and the kid bond a little more before needing rescued),and the soundtrack were done very well. this was the best blind purchase i have made so far.

Have been absolutely cranking this repeatedly the last few nights straight.  Brandon Flowers is such a presence on stage and the show just absolutely rocks.  Could be the best concert I've ever seen, especially when I didn't know 90% of the songs.      Solid recommendation.
B004RLEBTY|5.0|After only hearing 5 of the albums 10 songs I had to come here and rate it 5 stars. This album is AWESOME! They sound unique while you're still hearing influences from other bands such as Rob zombie and Mastodon. If you are a fan of either of those bands, or hard rock in general then give them a shot. You WON'T be disappointed. Great grooves, excellent production capturing their raw, powerful, loud sound perfectly, and you can tell the band loves what they do and the music they perform. I can't compare this to their first album as I only have this one but after hearing this album you won't go wrong with it. Support this band!
0316056863|4.0|I finished the entire book in a week as I could not put it down. I laughed my way through most of it. Very endearing and funny portrait of Tina Fey's life and experiences along the way. I could relate to much of the 80's nostalgia mentioned in the book.  It is understandable that Tina started out as a writer- you can definitely see why after reading this book.  Recommendation:  do not eat or drink while reading!
0767817478|1.0|I should have read some reviews before I watched this, but I was thinking, what could go wrong? Little did I know....    Well, the big thing that goes wrong is that the big monster is not Godzilla. I don't know who or what he is, but he's not Godzilla. I have to guess that the people who made this movie had never seen a Godzilla movie. As a Godzilla movie, this rates -10, because Godzilla is simply not in it.    As a generic monster movie, it's really not very interesting, and not particularly well done, aside from the special effects. The ending would be lame if it weren't so bad. I am guessing that the people who made this were probably not monster movie fans either.
B003Y74KCK|5.0|My wife uses this on her iPhone and loves it.  It is soft and flexible, which makes it easy to take on and off.  For far, it does not show any signs of getting dirty even though she keeps it in her pants pocket most of the day.    She also likes the fact that the rubber does not slip easily out of her pocket the way that plastic iPhone guards do.  To her, this is a major advantage over plastic.      Highly recommended!
B002E01MI8|5.0|This is a wretched film, make no mistake, but brilliant in it's sadism, perversion and \\"gross out\\" sequences which MORE than hold up to recent films. Plus Fulci's always top notch framing and cinematography is beautiful on this Blu Ray. And it's UNCUT, unlike the UK BBFC Censored edition from Shameless.
1594744769|5.0|His whole childhood, Jacob heard his grandfather tell tales of the incredibly peculiar children with whom he grew up.  The older Jacob gets, though, the more he thinks his grandfather's tales are nothing more than make believe.  But, when his grandfather speaks a few cryptic words before he dies, Jacob is determined to learn the mysteries of his grandfather's youth.  He ends up on a creepy island, learning the startling truth of his grandfather's life/<br /><br />What an incredibly imaginative book this is; I absolutely loved it.  First off, the story is so completely imaginative.  The plot is so different from most of the books out there.  The book is dark, and rich, and I just could not put it down.  One of my favorite parts of the book was the accompanying pictures.  It felt as though Riggs had taken a collection of odd photos, and wove them into an incredible story.<br /><br />I though the characters were really well developed and thought out.  The characters were complex, from Jacob to the peculiar children.  I loved seeing all the different relationships unfold, and more than once found myself surprised about the revelations about some of the characters.<br /><br />While the story is aimed at young adult readers, the story is complex enough to entertain and thrill adult readers.  For me, it felt much like the Lemony Snicket books, for an older audience.  The story ends in such a way that makes me hope there will be a sequel.

B0040YFR1Y|3.0|...Pros: new predator designs are kool. movie takes place in the jungle where it belongs not in the city like in P2. I like the variety of different \\"victims\\". Adrien Brody was very good in this movie even though i dont think that he is leading man material, they should of gotten someone like Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson or Gerard Butler.  ...Cons: Adrien Brody is jus not a tuff enuff lookin actor for this movie. an old overweight Laurence Fishburne survives 10yrs in the predator game world and even learns how to use the predators equipment but then is quickly killed off in 15mins? LOL! in Predator 1 & 2 one predator killed loads of people yet the 3 more advanced predators in this movie gets killed pretty easily.
1594744769|3.0|MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN offers a unique premise in that it combines a story with vintage photographs to present a tale that is both whimsical and chilling. I loved the idea of this book.  16-year-old Jacob grows up listening to the tales of his grandfather's childhood in an orphanage filled with children with unusual powers and evil monsters lurking in the shadows.  As Jacob grows older, he begins to doubt the veracity of his grandfather's tales believing that they grew out of his grandfather's struggles under the Nazi regime.  When Jacob's grandfather is killed under mysterious circumstances, Jacob decides to investigate his grandfather's past by going to the orphanage where he grew up.  Once there, Jacob discovers that the people...and monsters...might be real after all.<br /><br />The vintage images in this book are haunting and set the tone perfectly. The mystery is creative if a bit inscrutable.  I loved Jacob's search for the truth but the explanations were fuzzy and the bad guys a bit over the top. I was a little disappointed that the book wasn't MORE whimsical.  It seemed to get a bit too caught up in its structural device without working more on character development.  I wish the author had developed the story a bit more.  I would have given it a higher rating. Still, it has a lot of mystery, action and suspense.  I am divided on whether I will continue to reading the series.  However, I would still recommend this book to most young adult readers looking for something unusual and different to read. It's worth it for the photos alone.
0312330537|4.0|Really enjoyable if slightly too long story of a man on the run who hides out in 80's Bombay and ends up a street hustler, a slum doctor, a prison inmate, a gangster, a bollywood stuntman and extra, a Mujahideen fighter in Afghanistan and a smuggler. The story is apparently based upon the authors own experiences.     This may be a love it or hate it book and I guess I am more on the love it side of things. The book provides a vivid account of Bombay life at the time and very good descriptions of the different parts and elements of the city. You really feel you get to know and like Bombay and its people. As well as that it has many different stories within it that keep it interesting.     That said the book is too long and does drag at times but never enough to skip parts or give up on it. I feel much of the extra length is due to the authors own attempts to prove himself by being overly wordy and given his early troubles in life maybe that is understandable. If you read the negative reviews of the book (I often find its the best way to judge if I'd like something) most of the complaints are that his prose is poor and overly descriptive and it is quite often. There is also a lot of self aggrandising not so subtly disguised as being humble. However, none of this takes away from the overall story which is very entertaining.     Reading the blurb on the back of the book and all the different roles Lin took up in Bombay and beyond I was slightly sceptical that the book would be ridiculously over the top but I didn't think it was. While the story is unlikely it is written in a way where moving to a slum, joining the mafia or going to fight in Afghanistan don't seem ridiculous and its certainly no less believable than many top authors action novels. Some of the stories may be more appealing than others. I particularly enjoyed his description of life in Arthur Road Prison and his time in the Afghanistan mountains with the Mujahideen and I was slightly bored by the ongoing Karla love thing and Kanderbhai's philosophising. There are many exciting action scenes, tense and terrifying scenes, genuinely sad scenes (and a few meant to be sad scenes that fail) and laugh out loud funny scenes too (Prabaker's over underpants scene had this effect on me).     The same can be said of the many characters in the book some are more interesting than others and as has been said Lin is not one of the strongest characters because despite his faults being a former and at one stage lapsing heroin addict, gangster and all round tough guy he is much too \\"right on\\". By this I mean almost everybody likes him and he likes almost everybody (except obvious \\"bad\\" people), he is too good at most things, he spends way to much time analysising his life and life in general and he goes on too much about his prowess as a fighter, at speaking Hindu and Marathi, about instantly making correct judgements about people and about his feelingas of loss. In other words the character (obviously supposed to be most like the author) is just too pretentiously deep. However, this is more than made up for by some wonderful characters Prabaker, Didier, Vikram are to my mind amongst the best. These are not one dimensional side chaaracters. mostly they are given good believable background stories which help to make them seem real (as some of them may be).     So despite the shortcomings of the book I really enjoyed the story and was able to overlook the elements which have ruined the book for others. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to everyone as the sheer length and different elements of the story may make some readers lose interest but I am glad I read it. It did not (as some have claimed) change my life but it did provide me with many hours of entertainment and despite my moans about its length I have found myself wishing I had more of it to read.     One thing I would like to know and I have been unable to find out anywhere online is which elements are true and which are fictional. From what I can gather all the early stuff about his life is true and well documented (although not really covered by this book). However, it is from his arrival in Bombay that it is unclear what is true and what is not. Admittedly it is a tall tale and if it is all true he has had some very good and very bad luck as well as making some unusual decisions in his life. Some have suggested that it is all fiction, which to be honest wouldn't bother me as I still really enjoyed the story. From the Shantaram website's \\"about the author\\" page it appears that Roberts is claiming that all the different \\"jobs\\" he did happened. However, he also admits that it is not a true story! As far as I can gather it seems that Roberts is claiming that everything happened generally but not necessarily in the way described in the novel. For example I believe that he has admitted that there was never any Sapna killings and that this was his creation. If anyone can point me in the direction of a webpage that sheds more light on this please post a comment.
B003WFKJRE|5.0|Clemens Krauss's Ring cycle has been available for a long time but it has NEVER sounded as good as it does in this incarnation!<br /><br />I used to have the Krauss Ring in the Opera D'Oro set (the only other in a slim box), and as soon as I compared it to this new Orfeo release, it was significantly and definitively superior.  The sound is cleaner, the voices more focused and the orchestra much more detailed.  I'm glad that Orfeo got a hold of the original master tapes.  They did some splendid work on remastering, one of the best remastering jobs I've heard in a while!  Thus giving us a aurally vivid historic glimpse into early Bayreuth from a Master conductor and a heroic team of soloists.<br /><br />Now we can enjoy Clemens Krauss's interpretation as if we were there ourselves!
B00005JLF5|4.0|I am going to keep this short and sweet. Deep Space Nine and Voyager are the best.  Well can't forget about Star Trek TOS, but I think anybody would enjoy it.   Deep Space Nine has everything that a Star Trek needs.
0060899220|3.0|Would've been less dull if it were about 100 pages shorter. A better editing job would've rendered his anecdotes far more cohesive and readable, instead of repetitive and boring after the initial few chapters, which were fast paced enough.     Too much of the book is based on trying to shock its readers...a lot of fluff, not a whole lot of substance.  Or perhaps I'm just not that easily impressed at the antics that his staff/peers get up to: having worked both in the restaurant/nightlife industry AND as a bond broker, nothing raises my eyebrows anymore...
0312370849|5.0|I have always read books about the Holocaust. I have greedily read them for as long as I can remember; I read them more than once, pleading with myself to understand what it must have felt like to be involved. I have brooded over them. I often think back to ones I read years ago, such as Number the Stars, The Devil's Arithmetic, Alicia. I long to re-read the ones which I cannot remember the title or the author. Yet one truth remains: I always remember the horror associated with this bleak time in the history of the world which the authors and survivors so heartbreakingly capture. I have longed to be able to wrap my mind around this time period. Yet it remains unfathomable.    Tatiana de Rosnay certainly asserts herself as a powerful force in this sub-genre. Sarah's Key is among the best I have read: it is poignant, heartbreaking, and beautifully written. de Rosnay flawlessly juxtaposes Paris in 2002 with that of 1942 Paris. Even her writing style changes when shifting between the two periods; she uses a more formal verbiage when writing the descriptions and dialogues of 1942, a more punchy, contemporary vocabulary when writing about 2002 and beyond. She expertly guides readers through time--across decades, between countries--across continents, and through generations.    In all my years of reading about the Holocaust, I have never heard about the Vel' d'Hiv. de Rosnay not only made the Vel' d'Hiv real; she made it present. It is something people can never escape. de Rosnay makes this apparent in the character of Julia; I don't want to say more for fear of spoiling the book. Suffice it to say de Rosnay makes sure we all understand that we can never forget.    I read this book in less than 24 hours. This should speak volumes about the beauty of this novel. Please read it; it will consume you the way only a truly fantastic book can.
B004G7FFF8|5.0|This box set is epic!<br /><br />I've been waiting years for this to be released in a single box. I once wrote to Hyperion urging them to do so.  Thankfully my prayers and many others have been answered!  Now that I have it, I can begin the monumental undertaking of studying Franz Liszt in all his pianistic glories!<br /><br />From the accompanied book:<br /><br />\\"...Accomplished within 14 years, it encompasses over 300 premiers, including works prepared by Dr. Howard from Liszt's still unpublished manuscripts, and works unheard since Liszt's lifetime.  This monumental project merited Dr. Howard's entry into the Guinness Book of World Records, the Medal of St. Stephen, the Pro Cultura Hungarica Award, and a mounted bronze cast of Liszt's hand, all presented to him by the president of Hungary - and 6 \\"Grand Prix du Disques\\".<br /><br />Thank You Hyperion and Thank You Mr. Howard!
B003G4W49C|5.0|The best part to me about this whole series is that Ender is not infallible and the choices that he makes are as human as the rest of us.  He seeks friends, he fears, he loves, he longs, he does his duty, he shames himself, and he grows.  Just like the rest of us.  Mr. Card did a great job.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the whole series.
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Jack White and Norah Jones and came to know Danger Mouse from Gnarls Barkley. At first I was not sure how this would sound but after hearing it on NPR I was stunned. When I first hear music and it makes a chill run up my spine I know its a hit. Every song on this album is a winner. Not to mention that I love Norah's new sound. I always knew her breathy voice was destine for the alternative scene. This will be in my playlist for some time. Great job!! Thank you!!
B004KPLVV8|4.0|If you were amongst those who saw Tron: Legacy in theaters or on DVD, you may be curious to see its predecessor that came out 28 years earlier. Hard to find a few months ago, the original Tron was finally released again by Disney back in April to coincide with the DVD release of Legacy. So how does it hold up?<br /><br />For starters it has a pretty good cast. Leading the cast is Jeff Bridges as computer programmer turned arcade-owing hacker Kevin Flynn whose attempts to prove that his work was stolen by a rival programmer leads to him being sent into the digital world of the movie. Bridges gives Flynn an eccentric yet everyman quality that, while perhaps not serving the character best in the opening part of the movie, works perfectly when the character of Flynn ends up trying to make sense of the digital world he finds himself in. Bruce Boxleitner plays computer programmer Alan Bradley and his creation: the heroic security program named Tron. The two are very different characters and at times it is hard to believe that are being played by the same actor because of the huge differences between them. Aiding them in both the real and digital world are Cindy Morgan (as Lora and Yori) and Barnard Hughes (as Dr. Walter Gibbs and Dumont) who, like Boxleitner, find ways of making each of their characters different from the other. Opposing them, and perhaps giving the best performances in the movie, is David Warner as program stealing executive Ed Dillinger in the real world as being both the digital world menace of Sark and the electronically distorted voice of the the dictatorial Master Control Program. Put all these actors together and the result is that they give this digitally set movie a human grounding.<br /><br />Which brings us to perhaps the most iconic part of the movie: the digital world the majority of the movie takes place in. Given that the nearly thirty years that have passed since the movie was made have seen a true revolution in special effects, one might expect that the effects (including some of the earliest CGI effects) would look rather passe now. The truth of the matter is in fact quite different: the digital world of Tron  is a truly immersive, and highly original, one.<br /><br />The production design, costumes and effects all go towards creating that unique world. The production design imagines a digital world that is both alien and yet familiar with its take on tanks, ships and perhaps most famously cars in the form of light cycles. Then there are all of the unique costumes of the digital characters with their stark whiteness contrasted by the illuminations of the apparent circuitry on them with a truly unusual look being the result. Last but not least on this list is all of the effects work. The effects would seemingly be the most dated part of the original Tron and to some extent this is true on the surface. But if you scratch below the surface you'll discover that those seemingly dated effects are surprisingly effective. Two perfect examples can be found in the light cycle gaming sequence where there is a point of view shot that gives the viewer a true sensation of speeding along a maze of lines or during the chase sequence that follows directly on from it when the \\"camera\\" follows two ships that are pursuing the escaping light cycles. If you are however looking at the effects of the movie cynically from the viewpoint of today's CGI here is another way of looking at them within the logic of the movie: the film is set and uses early 1980s computers and therefore it makes perfect sense that the digital world reflects the technology of the time rather the more advanced and evolved digital world seen in Legacy. Back to the main point though: the result of all these elements put together is that the digital world setting of the film remains both unique and immersive almost thirty years on.<br /><br />No review of the film though would be complete without a discussion of its script or storyline. The basic plotof Tron are quite simplistic: in the real world Flynn is trying to prove that Dillinger stole his programs to further his own career while in the digital world Flynn and Tron end up on a quest to save to free that world from the tyrannical reign of Dillinger's Master Control Program and its minion Sark. The dialogue too is more often then not as simplistic as the plot and can be at times either corny or cringe-worthy. Yet Tron's script and story are full of fascinating ideas: Programs acting as avatars of their programmers with deletions being their literal death (or derezzing), information and programs being sent along by incredible vehicles with energy or light used as paths, and even religious undertones to the relationship of programs to their users which features throughout the film is various character discussions and is best illustrated in the scene where Tron communicates with his user Alan Bradley. As a result Tron on the script and story level is very much driven by its ideas rather then its own plot.<br /><br />While it may be lacking in plot, Tron makes up for that in other ways. That includes the cast which makes the most of the duel roles that most of them have. Where it does that mainly though is in the immersive digital world it is set in and the ideas that lie behind it. Tron therefore is perhaps more a triumph of style over substance but it more then makes up for that fact.in the real world Flynn is trying to prove that Dillinger stole his programs to further his own career while in the digital world Flynn and Tron end up on a quest to save to free that world from the tyrannical reign of Dillinger's Master Control Program and its minion Sark.

B004X8W468|5.0|Loved it. While previewing this book for my daughter, I found a very engaging story with vivid characters and setting.  I felt like I was reading a jigsaw puzzle, and couldn't wait to see how the pieces fit together, and they did!  The story was a lighter read than _A Wrinkle in Time_ and less intricate as _Holes_, but I enjoyed it more.  Highly recommend for pre-teens and up.  I think that the most important concept in this book is that people (like books) shouldn't be judged by their first appearance.  Most of the characters turn out quite different than the main character Miranda's initial impression.  Miranda, like most pre-teens, is just struggling to sort out who to value in her growing world.  And she learns that people can surprise you in many different ways.

B000784WMW|4.0|This is another example of a classic period romance that is definitely worth watching. The acting was excellent. The dialogue was excellent, especially for the two main characters. This lacks the flash and cinematography of modern movies, but the story, the acting and dialogue make this an excellent choice for those who appreciate substance over style.

OK Computer is NOT the greatest album of the 90s. \\"Exit Music\\", \\"Karma Police\\", \\"Electioneering\\", \\"No Surprises\\", and maybe even \\"Paranoid Android\\" are fairly alright songs...but they are not the be-all-end-all of modern day rock music.

Sorry, RH fans, but I like to enjoy my music, not fall asleep to it.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Just got this product today and it has served its purpose wonderfully. I bought them to try and make my headphones louder because they were barely audible (you see I made them myself). This cranked up to sound volume to a perfect level and I can now call my homemade headphones project a true success. But, the claim about improving sound quality seems to be not true as my monster turbine pro golds seem to sound a bit sloppier when plugged into these. But,it served its purpose very well and was a great low price. 5 stars.

B004H1V5RU|1.0|After waiting for months (including the postponed release date), the Perpluxus Epic finally arrived yesterday and my son was overjoyed when he returned home from school.  However, after only an hour of playing with it he showed me that one of the screws (by #1) was very loose and that he must be careful that the ball doesn't fall through when he begins playing(picture posted).  Another hour later, he came to me to tell me that the funnel piece totally dislodged from the Perplexus (picture posted as well) and is now rolling around the unit whenever it is moved, effectively making it unplayable. This seems to be the same piece that has broken on another reviewer unit as well.  As you can imagine, my son and I are devastated!  After waiting months for this, the unit broke within a few short hours and was not even dropped once (compared to our regular Perplexus that has been dropped multiple times but keeps on ticking!).  I have emailed the company but have not received a response yet.  Edit- After contacting the company, I received a replacement which seems to be much better quality.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|First the bad news: BATTLE: LOS ANGELES was hated by 65% of Rotten Tomatoes critics.<br /><br />Now the good news: I ain't one of them.<br /><br />BATTLE: LOS ANGELES is about evil aliens attacking LA. This is a great movie. As a former Los Angelina, it was fun seeing the City of Angels destroyed by beings from another world. The action is well-paced and the military portrayals feel authentic. The characters are believable and engaging. Honestly, my husband and I really enjoyed watching this movie. When BATTLE: LOS ANGELES was over, we felt like we had just beaten the Soviet hockey team.<br /><br />So why the negativity from the critics? My first thought was that they didn't like that this was a war movie, albeit against aliens. In fact, that's what one critic said. She seemed to think the filmmaker was sneaking her some Afghanistan V8 disguised as fruit punch. Hello! It's called BATTLE: LOS ANGELES for a reason! One critic said it lacks soul. Absolutely not! If you don't get even a little choked up, then it's not the movie that's lacking soul. Another critic complains \\"Se fosse espremido e engarrafado, resultaria num perfume batizado como Le Phallus.\\" Uh, I don't know Portuguese, but Madre de Dios that can't be good.<br /><br />Bottom line, I enjoyed BATTLE: LOS ANGELES much more than several other movies I've reviewed. If you like what amounts to an old-fashioned Western, then by all means, give this one a look.

0738727326|4.0|This beautifully illustrated tarot is the creation of Stephanie Pui-Mun Law.  The imagery in these cards exudes an ethereal quality like no other tarot that I have ever seen.  In spite of the superb imagery, this deck doesn't depart much from the Rider Tarot tradition.<br /><br />These cards are bordered in gray; numbered and labeled at the bottom.  The back of these cards is reversible, showing the classical depiction of a sun surrounded by an ornate ring which gives out an aura over a purple-black and starry space.<br /><br />The Major Arcana are numbered with roman numerals.  Labeled with the standard naming convention from the Rider Tarot, these cards certainly follow this tradition in a spectacular way.  For example, The Tower shows a city, and within the city a tree stand taller than anything.  At the top of the tree there is a tower being struck down by lighting.<br /><br />However, I thought that the superb ethereal imagery could have inspired, and easily justified, a name change of a few of the Major Arcana.  For example, Death shows a Phoenix like creature perching on a tree, while the Hierophant shows an Ent like creature sitting on the branch.<br /><br />The suits on the Minor Arcana (swords, wands, cups and pentacles) corresponding element (air, fire, water and earth) are subtly integrated within the scenery of the cards.  The court cards follow the standard naming convention of Page, Knight, Queen and King.  My favorite cards from the court must be Knights, with the Knight of Swords riding a swan, the Knight of Wands riding a horned lion, the Knight of Cups riding an unicorn on high surf, and the Knight of Pentacles riding a earth Dragon.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this deck.  This deck comes with a Little White Book.<br /><br />Other decks by Stephanie Pui-Mun Law:<br />[[ASIN:0738715794 Shadowscapes Tarot]]

Something Paramount should look into and arrange with this person to redo the film to make it better.   As to the worst, SORRY Mr. Ebert  but of the Trek films  Generations holds that title.  Compared to Generations, and it's story line, Trek five seems like a decent movie.   GENERATIONS  not only has a horrible story line, especially once inside the nexus.  Yeah it's 80 years after Kirk's death  and yet from his view point  he just arrived in the nexus also,  what  he lay in limbo for 80 years?  the whole opening with the 1701-B was way to fast, and short leaving  huge gaps  and questions,  then the whole soran, klingon, and especially picards alter life in the nexus  just dragged!   So No Mr. Ebert  Star Trek 5  was NOT the worse by any means.

B001AGXEAG|4.0|Beetlejuice has been one of those movies that was a favorite of mine as a kid, but haven't watched in ages, and finally saw the whole thing recently.  After watching it again, it's still a fun and dark movie that'll cheer you up on a bad day (even if you're having a good day, watching this movie will probably make your day better).<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />In a quaint small town in New England, newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) drown in the river on their way home from the hardware store.  The couple soon learns they're dead, but things get worse when the Deetz family, and obnoxious family from New York, buys their house and is changing everything, much to Adam and Barbara's dismay.  Their efforts to scare away the Deetz family come to no avail, so they're very tempted to get help from a freelancing bio-exorcist named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton), but it could mean serious trouble if they summon him.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />The characters in Beetlejuice are well done.  Catherine O'Hara does a really good job as Delia Deetz, whose the most obnoxious in the family as she's constantly demanding that the family's new house be remodeled to her weird artistic tastes, and that she's self-absorbed into her weird artwork (her abstract metal sculptures certainly look like things Tim Burton would make).  Winona Ryder does a fantastic job of playing Lydia Deetz, whose a goth girl that's the only one who can see the ghosts of Adam and Barbara.  Ryder nails the goth personality in the movie as she has a strong interest in all things \\"dark and weird\\" yet has some emotional diversity as to not make her look like a painfully cliche cardboard-cutout of a mopey teenager in black attire.  Jeffrey Jones does a good job of playing Charles Deetz, who nails the personality of a man whose lost his nerves and only wants to hide in his special part of the house and relax while he's clipping coupons and bird-watching.  Baldwin and Davis do a fine job as well with their roles as Adam and Barbara, as they match the feeling of a newlywed couple, and act believably as ghosts since they act in desperation due to their scare tactics not really working all that well (they'd do better with Betelgeuse's help later on).  Of course, it's Betelgeuse that's the center of the show, even though he doesn't create a heavy presence until the latter half of the film.  He's delightfully disgusting, perverted, crude, but most of all, hilarious.  He certainly masters that rare trait of being antagonistic yet likeable (a similar feat Jack Nicholson would accomplish as the Joker in Batman a year after this movie), as he's doing nasty things to the main characters yet delivers such humorous lines and gags.<br /><br />APPEARANCE<br /><br />While not as heavy as visuals as compared to another iconic Tim Burton movie like Batman, Beetlejuice has some really good visuals that have that distinctive Tim Burton feeling to them.  The cinematography of New England is quite pretty, and is a good contrast to the weird and dark visuals Burton is best known for (this is also the first Burton film where that style is fully realized).  The \\"weird and dark\\" visuals are largely restricted to the world of the afterlife.  You got charred green corpses smoking cigarettes, deceased poachers with shrunken heads, Barbara hiding in a closet and tearing off her face when Delia and Otho appear (no avail in scaring them), the Deetz family and their guests singing and dancing to \\"Day-O\\" before being attacked by haunted shrimp, dead football players confusing an afterlife social worker for their coach, Betelgeuse turning into a snake that peeks up Delia's skirt and drops Charles off a second floor, \\"sand worms\\" in a surreal dessert-like dimension similar in spirit to Wackyland (featured in the Porky Pig cartoon \\"Dough for the Do Do\\"), and even Delia's metal sculptures come to life towards the end of the film (there's more, but I think that gives you a good idea).Overall, I think the weird visuals in this movie were the prototypes for A Nightmare Before Christmas (and I mean that in a good way).<br /><br />HUMOR<br /><br />Betelgeuse is the main source of humor in this movie, and he delivers some really potent laughs throughout.  I personally felt the scene where he's hiding in Adam's model of their town and lures a fly to its demise with a Zagnut bar to be one of the funniest, as he grabs the fly and pays homage to The Fly screaming \\"Help me!  Help me!\\" as he grabs the fly.  Another notable funny moment is when Adam and Barbara ask Betelgeuse if he's \\"qualified\\" to be scary, he lists all of his accomplishments over the last several hundred years and says \\"I've seen The Exorcist 167 times, and it only gets funnier every time I watch it!!\\"  Betelgeuse even does some more subtle things that still squeeze some hearty laughs out of me, like when Adam and Barbara shrink him back into the model town, Barbara grabs him and Betelgeuse makes her drop him by making a bunch of spikes pop out of his torso.  Even some scenes that aren't centered around Betelgeuse are still pretty darn funny, such as when Juno, Adam and Barbara's afterlife social worker, has a bunch of dead football players swarming her and Juno has to constantly tell them that she's not their coach and to berate them for their overall stupidity.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />Danny Elfman strikes more musical gold for his soundtrack in this movie.  The main score of the film has a very whimsical feel to it, setting the mood for the film very well.  There's also some scores that retain the whimsical feel of the main score but add some darker tones to match the darker scenes in the film.  The use of the songs \\"Day-O\\" and \\"Jump in the Line (Shake Shake Senora)\\" also fit very well with the scenes they belong to.<br /><br />MATURE CONTENT<br /><br />Despite being a PG film, there's still some content that parents will be uneasy with in letting their kids see, due to the fact that PG films from the 80's had more leniency in what content was allowed on film.  Betelgeuse goes to a small brothel Juno imagined in Adam's model of the town and there's one instance each of him dropping the F-bomb and S-bomb.  After watching this movie for the first time in ages, I'm really surprised they made a spinoff cartoon series geared for kids, as they had to change around Betelgeuse's character a lot for the cartoon.<br /><br />PRODUCT PLACEMENT<br /><br />While the product placement in this movie isn't nearly as heavy as the Pepsi endorsements featured in the Sylvester Stallone film Cobra, it's clear that the Coca Cola corporation help sponsor the movie as there's clear shots of a Coke can at the dinner table (the \\"Day-O\\" scene) and of Minute Made orange juice.  I don't know if K-Mart sponsored the film or not, but I did find Betelgeuse saying \\"Attention K-Mart shoppers\\" before he torments the Deetz family and their guests near the end to be pretty funny.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />Beetlejuice isn't a deep or profound film, and it doesn't try to be.  It's a very funny dark comedy that's certainly unique.  If you want some classic dark comedy, then Beetlejuice should be in your collection.  If anything, seeing Michael Keaton as a hilariously wacky ghoul alone is worth it.e were the prototypes for A Nightmare Before Christmas (and I mean that in a good way).

B004QPOVF0|1.0|I was really looking forward to watching this dvd but the editing gave me a headache after the first five minutes. Can someone explain to me why each camera shot is only 3 to 4 seconds long? I wish I had waited to read the reviews before I wasted my money on this.
B0045XRJ0C|5.0|GOT THE ALBUM BACK IN MARCH, BEEN LISTENING TO IT NON-STOP, ITS A LIFE-SOUNDTRACK....ITS LYRICS ARE SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL & PUTS  INTO WORDS SO MANY FEELINGS, THE USE OF OLD-SCHOOL BLUEGRASS INSTRAMENTS, ESP.THE BANJO ARE BRILLIANT, I DISLIKE SOOOOO MUCH MODERN MUSIC PLAYED IN THE U.S. THESE DAYS, BUT WHEN I HEARD 'LITTLE LION-MAN'...I SAID TO MYSELF, THIS IS MY TYPE OF COUNTRY!! YAY FOR THE UK!  I'M TOTALLY EXCITED TO SEE THEM IN CONCERT JUNE 9...SO MUCH SO NOW I THINK I GOTTA LISTEN TO THE ALBUM AGAIN ;D    BTW- ANYONE REALLY HAVE A GOOD PRO V CON OF THE VINYL?? IS THE SOUND REALLY AS BAD AS SOME SAY?
B004IQMXD4|1.0|Her voice is gone! Be truthful. Most of the time her voice is double tracked or surrounded by other voices. This is not the voice of Stevie of Fleetwood Mac.  The cd cover? Is anybody else tired of the whole forest elf, witch, enchantment nonsense.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|This is a sturdy, well-made case (what you would expect from Case Logic!).  It will hold an SLR camera, but also good for a smaller one.  Has some extra space for accessories.  In addition to the handle on top and the detachable shoulder strap, it does have a loop for carrying on your belt, but I think it is a bit bulky for that.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|To be honest, I was never really a big fan of the 'Little Red Riding Hood' story, but I grew up with the story because of Faerie Tale Theatre. Because of Twilight, everything you see nowadays is ridiculous women falling in love with vampires and now werewolves. They figured they may as well use it with Classic Fairy Tale stories. (In fact, Catherine Hardwicke who directed the original Twilight also directed this movie!) It's getting out of control, next Goldilocks is gonna fall in love with a sparkly grizzly bear!<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried stars as Valerie/Red Riding Hood who lives in the small village of Daggerhorn. She is in love with Peter, but betrothed to Henry (Edward/Jacob) Soon, a werewolf comes to town and tries to get Valerie to come with it. She is the only one that can understand it. Father Solomon comes to town and takes control of everything and tries to kill the werewolf by any means necessary. I probably wouldn't recommend RED RIDING HOOD!!!
0470449756|5.0|If you are taking the GMAT you need this book, and the verbal review. Yes there are not that many \\"hard\\" problems, but all of the problems are retired GMAT questions. Plus some of the easier questions can trip you up sometimes, and that lowers your score a ton. So it is good to get used to answers all types of GMAC problems. All of the GMAT prep companies try to make questions that simulate these. Most of those companies do a horrible job, so when you get to the actual test the questions are much different (personal experience). No matter what score you are going for you need all three GMAC books.

1439102813|4.0|The book \\"Still Alice\\" is so riviting that I couldn't put it down.  If you have anyone in your family with memory problems, or if you are experiencing the same, please read this book.  It's good to be aware of what's happening with a loved one, a friend, or yourself.  The author has written it so it's not full of medical terms, and it's a story about a young woman of 50 who is diagnosed with Alzheimers.  This book was recommended to me and I would definitely recommend it to others.

159562015X|5.0|This book is really all about the online survey that you fill it.  Once you complete it, it will give you your top 5 strengths.  Be sure you allow plenty of time to complete the survey, and do it when you are realxed and not thinking about a million other things.  The summary results and synopsis about your top 5 strengths are very interesting, and I found them to be very accurate and reassuring.  It can be very helpful to be reminded about what you are really good at, since we can sometimes downplay or doubt our good qualities.  The whole premise of the book is that we are much better off concentrating on building upon and utilizing our strengths than we are trying to improve our weaknesses.  This process is very helpful to go through with a spouse, or your workgroup at the office, as it helps you learn how other peoples strengths influence their thinking, and how your strengths and their strengths interact with each other.  I work for a company in Minneapolis, and our whole office took the Strength Finders survey and we all have our top 5 strengths posted outside of our cubes.  Even if you do this simply as a self examination exercise, it is well worth it, and I am quite sure you will get something out of it, and you will at least feel like you got your money's worth.

B002KLFKJ8|5.0|This boot is nice looking and it's very fomfotable as well. It runs a little bit large so you probably need to buy a samller size. I normally ware 7 so I buy a 6.5 and it fits me very well.
0307712508|4.0|I normally don't read non-fiction or biography books. I'm more a fiction person, but this book came so highly recommended from friends that I decided to give it a try. As I do with many books I'm just not sure I'll enjoy, I opted to listen to the audiobook version. I can listen while I'm doing other things and still actually read another book (as opposed to listening). This way I get to read 2 books at once. I get the audiobook from the library, so if I don't like it, I haven't invested any money, just my time. I have \\"read\\" (aka, listened to) many books I normally wouldn't have and have surprised myself by enjoying them. (I've also gotten a few duds and stopped listening to them.)    Well, this one is a definite winner. The book is a combination of biography and biology/medical history but it reads like one whole exciting novel. Ms. Skloot weaves together information about the history of medical research into the life of Henrietta Lacks and her family. No history or biology class I ever took was ever this fascinating or emotional. I learned so much in this book but it never felt dry or boring (which is how I usually find history and science), probably because it is all intertwined with the lives of actual people. Since the book is told in first person from Ms. Skloot's point of view, everything seems much more personal and so much less detached than I was originally expecting. You really come to care about Henrietta and her descendants.    One of my concerns before starting this book was that it would be too technical for me. My fear was unfounded. Ms. Skloot manages to write so that the concepts and terms are understandable to anyone. You do not need to have a biology or medical degree to understand those parts of the book. In fact, my almost 12-year old daughter was listening with me when I first started the book and enjoyed it so much that she had me check out a paper copy from the library for her to read too, and she loved it! Other than having to look up a fewwords in the dictionary, she had no trouble understanding it.    The audiobook version was particularly good. Since the book is written in first person narrative, the reader made Ms. Skloot and her story come alive. She did an excellent job. There is also a secondary reader that narrates some of the larger quotes from some of Henrietta's family members and she was also excellent.    I highly recommend this book even if it's not the type of thing you normally read. Give it a try and you might be surprised. I know I was.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I'm a big fan of most of the versions of Pride and Prejudice and the book. The changes and deviations didn't bother me a bit because it was like a whole new movie with some of your favorite characters (especially Mr. Darcy). I've watched it a few times and can watch it many more. Any fan of Jane Austen should love this movie.

B000002KCV|5.0|With this album, Neil Young returned to his roots. The jaunty title track is a great song, but not the only one here. I particularly enjoy Field of opportunity, of which I don't remember hearing a cover version, as well as Neil`s cover (the only one on this album) of Four strong winds (the sixties classic by Ian Tyson). Another great song is Motorcycle Mama, a duet with Nicolette Larson in which he mostly sings the choruses and she mostly sings the verses.<br /><br />The opening track, Goin' back (Neil's own song, not to be confused with Dusty Springfield's hit) gets the album off to a great start. I'm not sure what it's about; looking at the lyrics, my first thought was that it could be about a volcanic eruption but I suspect that Neil may have written it about the consequences of war. Maybe it is deliberately ambiguous so that people can interpret it as they wish. Perhaps the pick of the tracks I haven't mentioned is Human highway, but this album is great from start to finish as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />When Neil's albums are discussed, this album is not usually picked out as being one of his career highlights, but it' is definitely one of my favorite albums of his.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This movie is my absolute favorite ever, with the Taming of the Shrew coming in second. I have watched this movie over 50 times over the years and am so happy to have been able to get it on disc. Thank you Amazon!

B0015DROBO|5.0|This book was definately not what I expected, I thought at first that it was going to be this mystical type book, hence the title, but it surprised me. I liked it a lot. It has this hard core, anti-social reject that is the main character that you grow to love: Lisabeth. I love her character! From the very beginning, you grow to love this hard-core tattooed freak from the outstanding authors talents at hatching an ugly duckling as a social reject in a society where it isn't acceptable and you have to have a guardian to take care of you.<br /><br />I also love her relationship that develops with Mikael, the reporter in this story.
B004NGYXIM|5.0|I can absolutely recommend to purchase this item.  The CD as well as the DVD of the \\"making of\\" are really great !!!!
B00003CY6M|4.0|This movie tried a little too hard to make everything work but fell short of the notable movies that preceded it. By that I mean one sees a little bit of Sleepless in Seattle, 1993, some of You've Got Mail, 1998, and a little bit of While You Were Sleeping, 1995, all recombined into a reasonably interesting film. The problem is by trying too hard it wound up on occasion creating an annoying situation in an effort to manipulate viewer emotions.<br /><br />The result was a movie that seemed too long to me and left me feeling it should have been over 15 to 20 minutes before it actually ended. If I were to guess, I would say my age was a significant factor in my perception of the movie.<br /><br />Younger viewers may not feel the way I do; in fact my daughter loved this movie and recommended it to us. It so happens that I'm a serious fan of the three other movies I mentioned above and have watched them many times; with that kind of background one can see how comparisons would be inevitable.<br /><br />I think both John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale do good jobs in their respective roles as do the major supporting actors, especially Jonathan's friend Dean, played by Jeremy Piven.<br /><br />I would suggest giving this movie a rental trial before buying; that way you could satisfy yourself as to the level of enjoyment it provided for you.
6304936362|2.0|As several have written, the story is a composite of things that happened, not the actual story of the Memphis Belle.  Given that, it was enjoyable to watch many of the scenes of the aircraft in flight.  As far as the crew, every cliche ever imagined was pulled into play, and the crew didn't behave as if they had 24 missions under their belts - more like it was the very first mission for an untrained crew.  Childish interaction, continual chatter even after the captain instructed them to keep the intercom clear.  Maybe forgiveable in the heat of the mission, but my experience as a Huey Aircraft Commander in Vietnam tells me that when the chips are down, even a squirrelly crew member focuses on the job at hand, not schoolboy bickering.  And, although perhaps needed for the benefit of the audience's understanding, it strained credibility for the captain to instruct the crew on the minutiae of things they need to remember.  After 24 missions, I would think they could finish each others' sentences.  Poor screenplay, poor direction, fun to watch the big bombers in action.
0316069353|5.0|This is a court drama starring the well-liked defense attorney, Michael Haller, who prefers to have his well stocked Lincoln automobile - with fax machine, computer, copying machine, and driver - as his office. When there is no murder case for him to defend, Haller decides to handle home foreclosure cases, getting only a couple of thousands of dollars per case, instead of the more than hundred thousand he charges for a murder case, but he makes the money because of the large volume of cases he can assemble. However, one of his foreclosure clients is charged with murdering the banker who took her home. Haller takes her case and is back doing what he does best. The story is engrossing, moves quickly, and is filled with interesting characters and suspense.<br /><br />Haller appears to have a losing case. There is a witness that says that she saw his client near the victim at the time he was murdered. The man was killed with his client's hammer and her blood is on it. His only defense is that the murdered man was struck on the top of his head with the hammer and his client who is five foot three could not reach the top of the six foot two man. Haller looks for a way to show reasonable doubt. He hopes to do this with his fifth witness by delving into the crooked foreclosure business.
B004IQMXD4|3.0|First, I am a major Stevie Nicks fan.  However, this cd is not my favorite and I was expecting so much more. I too had the date written on my calendar and told my husband to buy it for Mother's Day.  I was excited!  The lyrics on some of the songs seem lazy as if Nicks couldn't think of anything which is unusual considering she has created some of the most enchanting lyrics ever put to music.  I don't completely dislike the cd.  The strengths are: In Your Dreams, Soldiers Angel, Secret Love, Annabel Lee, You May Be the One and Moonlight.  My fear is that this could possibly be her last cd if she waits another 10 years (she's 62).  I would love to hear Stevie work with Buckingham, Petty, Henley and Jimmy Iovine.  I know that the names mentioned except for Petty were past lovers but Nicks has proven that she has the ability to remain on friendly, professional terms with past boyfriends.  She even briefly toured with Henley a number of years ago and includes Mick Fleetwood in her video for Secret Love.  She has worked with Buckingham many years after their 1976 breakup. Why not create more magic with these amazing artists?  Nicks has always had a gift for duets.  I would love a duets album.  I would like for Sheryl Crow to join her again too.  Nick's last cd was a gem and many of the songs Crow worked with her on.  One reviewer commented on the Battle of the Dragon's lyrics used in the song Soldiers Angel.  I picked up on the same thing.  I wasn't moved deeply with these songs like songs of the past.  Trouble in Shangri-La has some touching songs especially Love Is.  That is a moving song that can bring tears to ones eyes.  This type of depth was missing with In Your Dreams.  Again, I love, love Stevie but I think she picked the wrong producer and I like Dave Stewart but just not with Stevie.

B001EN71CW|4.0|For years our son and grandson have talked about \\"Firefly,\\" which was a TV series we somehow managed to miss.  But then I discovered Nathan Fillion on \\"Castle\\" and totally LOVED him, so I thought it would be fun to go back to the \\"Firefly\\" series and see him in action there.  Mr. Fillion has certainly grown as an actor from his \\"cowboys in space\\" series, bringing his quirky humor and pursed-lips smile to a modern-day police drama, but also showing more depth in character creation than \\"Firefly.\\"  My husband and I took a few nights to watch through the entire \\"Firefly\\" series -- especially enjoyed seeing the current TV series \\"V\\"'s evil queen mother \\"Anna,\\" who is portrayed by intriguing actor Morena Baccarin, but then was the \\"pretty young hooker with the heart of gold\\" -- chuckling frequently, dreading the nasty creatures who were formerly humans, and understanding why this short-lived TV series has remained a favorite today.
B004DCB62M|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle recently and I'm glad I did. It's a bargain, easy to search, and it's exceeding my expectations. I'm about 700 pages in, of the 1,600 pages.<br /><br />I read a few Holmes stories many years ago, but find I'm appreciating them more now.<br /><br />The modern parallels are interesting if sometimes eerie: Watson is a wounded Afghanistan war veteran (First Anglo-Afghan war, 1890-1899). He has trouble readjusting to civilian life. Holmes abuses cocaine and morphine. He examines crime scenes with an ahead-of-his-time scientific precision, looking for cigar ash, footprints, dirt particles, and hairs. He seems to be a person with bi-polar disorder.<br /><br />Also, I have a vintage print copy of the Complete Works, but the print is so small that eyestrain would be a problem. With the Kindle edition, I can make the print easily readable. Kindle's built-in New Oxford American Dictionary comes in handy for a few archaic and over-my-head words. (Conan Doyle's vocabulary rocks.)<br /><br />Highly recommend this Kindle edition of the Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection. Many hours of reading pleasure at a great price.
1401310400|4.0|I don't buy suspense or murder/crime books but since I have enjoyed the Castle Series this tie in was something I was willing to try.    The book reads like an episode from the t.v. show (I think that's the point).   I was surprised to find out that the sex scene was ACTUALLY ON page 105 (referenced on the t.v. show).  Although not that hot :(  Many of the jokes were funny and I the jargon was kept to a minimum... or were explained.    I plan on getting the other tie in books.. they are a few hundred pages and pretty quick to read.    The print quality of the book was a little goofy.. I guess the lighter print and brown/gray pages are how lower cost paperbacks come.. most of the book I read are on white paper of better quality and very good typeface.  Minor issue.  Book was easy to see and the cover art was good.

0521824370|4.0|As a reader who is tired of cliche romances and characters, I really enjoyed Emma for the unstereotypical main character. Emma is neither wonderfully good with dreadful circumstances (like Jane Fairfax, Jane Eyre, etc.), nor rich and intolerable (like Mrs. Elton, Scarlett O'Hara, etc.), rather she is like many of us today, a well-to-do girl who is nice but has faults. I loved how she grew through the story, slowly realizing more and more of her fundamental issues. Mr. Knightly is the perfect gentleman to everyone and a wonderful friend to Emma because he loves her enough to correct her for her faults. Even so, he grows and improves in the book as well. All of the characters have many facets to their personalities and characters and Austen weaves a beautiful web through the story. Emma is a lighthearted, fun read, yet has depth and relevant themes.<br />I recommend reading this book twice so that it can be fully appreciated.

0439023491|3.0|Having survived the Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is back home in Sector 12, not looking forward to her role as a mentor for the next year's games. She is surprised to hear rumours that her defiance of the Capitol and President Snow during the Games has sparked unrest and even discord in other sectors. When she and her co-winner, Peeta, conduct a tour of the districts, Katniss realises that her name and her emblem, the mockingjay, are being taken up as a symbol of rebellion and hope.<br /><br />Determined to crush Katniss's influence, Snow arranges a special new Hunger Games event for the 75th anniversary of the games. All the living winners of the games must return to the arena for a fresh battle...<br /><br />Catching Fire is the second volume of The Hunger Games Trilogy, Suzanne Collins' highly successful, post-apocalypse, dystopian YA SF series. Collins never intended to write a trilogy, so Catching Fire has some work to do to set up a bigger storyline that will be resolved in the following novel, namely the move from merely being a story set in a dystopia to a more epic story about the overthrow of the oppressive government.<br /><br />For these reasons Catching Fire has some issues. We're more than halfway through the novel before the second Hunger Games kick off, and we're not able to spend much time with those games before the conclusion arrives. This is a shame as Collins addresses some of the weaknesses of the first set of games, with many more contestants being identified and much better-characterised than first time around. The arena is also far more ingenious, with many more deadly traps. The games section of the novel and the conclusion are both rushed in an attempt to cover as much ground as possible before the final novel, which hurts the quality of this book.<br /><br />That said, it's still a fast-paced, readable and enjoyable book. We see more of Panem and get more of a sense what life is like for people living there, which is essential to better-establish the wider backdrop of the series. On the characterisation front, Katniss isn't always a sympathetic protagonist and often makes mistakes, which makes her more relatable and real. Other characters, like Peeta and newcomers like Finnick, are also given some solid scenes and character-building moments. The mutual hatred and anger between Katniss and President Snow is also well-handled. However, the Capitol and its rulers are rather dense in this book. Everything they do seems designed to inflame the situation and further the rebellion, which is weird for people who've been in charge for a century and have used the Hunger Games as a form of propaganda and control for seventy-five years, which requires some savvy knowledge of media and PR. Instead, the plot feels set-up ahead of time and both the reader and the characters are along for the ride.<br /><br />Catching Fire (***½) is a drop down in quality from The Hunger Games, but still an enjoyable and entertaining novel.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|Nicholas Sparks has written some of my favorite books ('A Walk to Remember' and 'The Notebook').  I hold him to a higher standard.  I listened to the audio version of this book.  The performance was just 'ok'.  This is the second audio performance that I found to be subpar.  He should be more discerning about who is reading his work.  Jo's character was particularly annoying.  #1 because her character was read as if Jo must be on Prozac to sound ridiculously incessantly giddy  #2 because I knew immediately where that story line was headed (I won't comment further and give it away).        The book has an interesting plot and parts of it were very intriguing.  I love the way Nicholas Sparks can capture the essence of a small town and simpler, more innocent times.  Reading his books makes me want to pack up and move to North Carolina.     I was disappointed in the way the book ended.  After so much tension building throughout the entire story, it just suddenly ended.  I didn't care for the over the top sappy letter from Alex's wife.  It was sweet and touching, but much too much.  I wanted to know more about what happened next with Katie and Alex.  There were lots of unanswered questions and loose ends.
0439023513|3.0|The districts are rebelling against the Capitol, united by the symbol of the Mockingjay. Katniss Everdeen, the symbol of the rebellion, is now living in the secretive District 13 where she finds that she is to be used as a figurehead to bring President Snow down. However, Katniss is unhappy with the demands being put on her, and also with the fate of Peeta, now a prisoner of the Capitol. As two sides prepare for a final confrontation, Katniss has to ask if her new allies are no better than the enemy they seek to destroy.    Mockingjay brings the Hunger Games Trilogy to a suitably bloody and epic conclusion. Though it has to be said it's also a somewhat rushed and predictable conclusion.    As mentioned in my review of Catching Fire, Collins wasn't planning for this to be a series, so had to scramble quickly in the second book to lay out a larger and more epic story. Whilst laudable, this effort was flawed because the story wasn't originally set up that way, and so many new characters and concepts had to be introduced in Book 2 that the actual plot of the book, Katniss fighting in a second Hunger Games, was fairly rushed. That problem extends into Book 3. Whilst the possibility of District 13 was first voiced in Book 2, we don't see it until Mockingjay. This means that in the space of a 430-page, large-typeface novel, Collins has to set up a whole new faction with its own cast of characters, ideology and goals, then bring in the existing cast and have them interact, then have them unite for the final assault on the Capitol, and then examine the issues raised by these storylines.    Collins does a credible job, but it's clearly not ideal. If the series had been planned as a trilogy from the start, District 13 and its dubious rulers could have been introduced and established earlier. Katniss's relationship with them and her lack of respect for authority, even an authority trying to achieve her long-term goal of destroying President Snow's regime, makes for a solid storyline, but it is under-explored here. In fact, the book is so packed that lots of elements are under-explored, and characterisation suffers. In particular, Finnick lacks the flair and fire he showed in the previous novel that made an interesting character, whilst Peeta comes across badly. Katniss continues to be a more complex heroine than expected, but most of the other characters suffer (and Coin, the head of District 13, is a bit of a two-dimensional figure at best).    On the plus side, the rapid pace means that the book is certainly action-packed, and Collins has some ingenuity in coming up with more weapons for the Capitol to deploy against the rebels. There's also a nice contrast between the deadly serious final attack on the Capitol and the Hunger Games of the previous two novels. This is also a harsher novel: Collins is pretty ruthless with some characters and it's definitely a bloodier book where Katniss has to do some more morally questionable things that in prior novels, which raises the stakes and the tension in the ramp-up to the finale.    Mockingjay (***½) is a readable conclusion to the series, though the rushed pace hurts some aspects of it. However, the series is brought to a solid-enough conclusion, if a reasonably predictable one. The book is available now in the UK and USA.
0345529057|3.0|This collection of fantasy sagas has very readable and intriguing plots that make them worth buying in themselves. Martin has produced some excellent characterizations but spoilt this with stereotypical characters. Unfortunately the paperback set although well priced is too small and printed on cheap paper. I would have preferred the kindle version but the much higher E book cost put me off. Many of the storylines mainly of political intrigue, magic and supernatural aspects of another world although eminently readable are also confusing. Possibly this perplexity is caused by Martin setting the stories in a pseudo medieval landscape. On balance I much prefer actual historical fiction about the Middle Ages. Try: [[ASIN:1908200138 Viking Sword Saxon Shield]]

B004I654WQ|5.0|When it premiered in 2006, Cars was met with some lukewarm response from critics. It was positive but not as positive as previous Pixar films have been met. Still, Cars is a really good movie with great animation, voice cast, characters and a good story. I've never been interested in the world of racing but when I saw Cars in theaters, I realize it was not only for racing fans. It has a wide appeal and I really enjoyed it. Lightning McQueen is a very well-rounded character and you can see his transformation from selfish moron to a caring and loyal friend. The story has really good messages and as with every Pixar film, the animation and the level of detail is simply breathtaking.<br /><br />Cars may not be your cup of tea but is a worthwile picture and I think it deserved the Best Animated Feature Oscar instead of Happy Feet which may be good but not as good at this one. Cars may be seen like the worst Pixar production but even worst Pixar means amazing and much much better than all the competition has to offer. Cars is an excellent film.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />Cars arrived on Blu-ray on 2007 in a single-disc package. Now Disney has repackaged it alongside a DVD in order to promote the sequel that will premiere this summer in theaters. Cars BD is magnificent. You can watch every detail, every nuance, every texture in the screen. No compression artifacts are found in the print. Cars BD is amazing.<br /><br />Likewise, the 5.1 uncompressed Audio is the equivalent of the picture in the sound department. You can hear everything with absolute clarity.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />In comparison with other Pixar BD sets, Cars is somewhat light in the bonus features department but still has a lot of insight bonus material.<br /><br />First you have the Cine-explore feature which allows you to see the picture in an interactive way where you can choose between two audiocomentaries (one with John Lasseter and the other with the animators), also this feature enables you to pick some featurettes that will appear from time to time.

B004132HZS|4.0|I liked the 21st century Sherlock. I have read all the books, and have watched many of the series with different actors. That was then and this is now. I know a lot of people have problems with some characters and story lines but you take the good with the bad. All sitcoms have something that some don't like or are disappointed at. The two important characters, at this moment, are Sherlock and Dr. Watson and they have done a good job. Later on we see about Dr. Moriarty. I find the acting entertaining and remember these are only 45-50 minutes shows.

B004L49K20|5.0|This is an amazing CD, arguably their best ever, with lots of strong tracks, some of which I consider can stand proudly along other DD classics like Rio, Save a Prayer, Ordinary World, Hungry like the Wolf, Girls on Film, A View to a Kill...    After a career of 34 years, when most groups will be happy to just play their old hits to aging fans, Duran Duran has released what can arguably be their best and most consistent CD.  It even appeals to younger listeners; my younger sons (9 & 13 yr old) love AYNIN, specially Mediterranea and The Man Who Stole a Leopard.    It is so good that I will be very happy to watch live, songs like Safe, All You Need Is Now, Mediterranea, Girl Panic, The Man Who Stole a Leopard, Runway Runaway, Too Bad You're So Beautiful, even at the expense of other Duran Duran classics like Planet Earth, Is There Something I Should Know, The Reflex.    I hope their upcoming tour makes a stop in Panama once again.  And let´s hope they capture this tour in pristine Blu-ray quality.    Extremely recommended.
B003UESJEM|4.0|Ben Afflack was a bad actor until 2010. This film and TOWN put him back on the map. He plays this role better than his role in TOWN.

B0050G3NWG|1.0|If you actually care about innovation and camera angles, then you might actually find this movie interesting.  If however, you are watching a movie for narrative and because you want to care about the characters, then this movie will leave you cold.  I can't help feeling that anyone who likes this movie is pretentious and only raves about this movie because it makes them appear somehow knowledgeable.  I fear that, like most critics, people who can 'see' something wonderful and profound in this movie only want to raise themselves above the masses and don't truly enjoy this debacle, for how could anyone enjoy a movie filled with obnoxious characters that has a protracted story with no compelling elements?    My family sat in dismay awaiting the wonders of this movie after it garnered so many critical reviews extolling its virtues and rating it the greatest movie ever made.  We were sadly disappointed.  My dad fell asleep; my sister--who has done media studies--couldn't handle it and left after less than an hour, and my mom & I sat in agony awaiting some magnificent event or epiphany that would allow us to see why people raved about this movie.  Alas, it never happened, and when it finished, we were just left thanking God that it was over.    I can easily rate this as one of the worst movies of all time, and it's a truly excruciating experience having to watch this.  I think they could inflict this movie on prisoners at Guantanamo bay to get them to talk.    It's worth noting that this movie bombed when it was released, and it was only subsequent views years later that people started to profess its virtues.  Technically, maybe yes.  Characterization and story line?  Snoozeville and, as stated, sheer agony to watch.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|This is a fantastic concert showcasing the Stones doing what they did best.

B004NJW976|4.0|\\"Destroyed\\" is a soundtrack seemingly sent from outer space to our eardrums. At times spacial, robotic and oceanic, \\"Destroyed\\" manages to be Moby's most accessible disc in many a year. And while most of the tracks lack true single appeal (with the exception of the glorious Snow Patrol meets David Bowie-ish \\"The Day\\"), the album is an easy listen from beginning to end. Rarely does one find an album in the electronic genre where the skip button is not utilized. This is one such rarity. An overwhelmingly welcome surprise.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|This is a great watch. In reading reviews I see people complaining that the watch is going to \\"gain 6 hours a day\\" and things like that. And I can tell you that you should disregard that. I'm wearing mine and it has only gained maybe 1 minute in 2 weeks of wearing. And lets be real, Seiko is a company that has been around for years and has been making premium time pieces since long before many if not most of us were even born; they arent just going to release a product that would gain 15 minutes a day. Hell, they wouldnt even release something that consistently would gain 1 minute a day, because that watch would be garbage and Seiko doesnt make fancy garbage shaped like wrist watches. So these people that make complaints about the watches running several minutes or more fast each day have obviously not considered the following:<br /><br />1. Considered that the watch may be damaged/not gone through proper Quality Check. And every Seiko comes with an international warranty. If the watch doesnt work, send it to them on their dime and make them fix or replace it.<br /><br />2. Because its a movement powered watch, the harder you move, the more tension and energy you put into the watch, the faster it might move. (For instance, i had my watch set 1 minute behind my phone clock and it consistently stayed that time for 1 week. Then I went to a Braves game and wore the watch, when I attended the game I was clapping, throwing my hands up in the air, throwing a ball around and waving my hands around while the watch was on my wrist. When I left Turner Field, the watch was running 1 minute fast and has stayed that way for another week thus far.) Therefore, don't wear it to play a game of basketball.<br /><br />3. There is a break-in period for watches like this. Essentially the watch has to get used to you as you wear it more the watch becomes more accustomed to how you move and provide it with energy through out the day.<br /><br />4. You local \\"watch guy\\" can tweak the watchto improve the accuracy for less than 10 dollars and some will do it for free. Remember that lots of these watches have been sitting for years before they were bought and could use a \\"check up.\\"<br /><br />This watch has one downside, and that is it's water resistance. 30 Bars = Washing your hands. Its still okay if you remember to take it off, but if this is something that bothers you and you are interested in buying this watch then you might just want to find an international site like chronograph.com and purchase the big brother, the SNZG15K1. That is also a great watch. And if you are seriously bothered by the reviews, then just try a different Seiko movement. There are a bunch of different automatic watches with different movements. Seiko is a good affordable watch for the average income earner. Try them out, you might like it.
B001G70M6S|5.0|After trying out the Fuji FP-300C (color) and really liking it, I decided to try this black and white film.  I love it!  It took a few trys with the FP-100C to get my Polaroid 250's settings just right because the camera's speed setting for color is 75 and the new color film is 100 speed.  This film is 3000 speed and the Polaroid Land cameras already have a 3000 speed setting for black and white film.  I just put my film in, set the film speed to 3000 and started taking great photographs.  Every picture has turned out perfect!  The photos look classic and artistic with excellent black and white contrast and the famous Polaroid white border.  I think the best thing about this film is the ability to shoot pictures indoors without flash, which you can't really do with the color film.  If there is enough light in the room to read comfortably you can take amazing pictures without flash with this film.  To me, this alone makes the Fuji FP-3000B the best instant film for the classic Polaroid Land cameras!

I don't think the KVM switch market has come up to speed with the new Thunderbolt technology yet so I will probably have to wait and buy a new compatible KVM switch when and if one comes out.
B0002U0UKS|4.0|This is one of my favorite movie soundtracks.  It's has such depth and emotion in it.  Hisaishi is truly one of the best.
0446563048|3.0|\\"Decent book that is more about common sense related to customer service. Zappos is an ideal model for 'above and beyond' service but almost collapsed due to this philosophy, which is not bottom line friendly. It is more a look at how we all \\"wish\\" companies could operate and be successful. I think outside of their logistical efficiencies that came later, this is more the exception than the rule in business.\\"
B000002J2D|5.0|And then there were three great classic Genesis albums out without Peter Gabriel... When it was released in March 1978, \\"...And Then There Were Three\\" was dismissed as a sellout. Well, thirty-three years after that it's proved it wasn't so.<br /><br />Although it did introduce more accessible musical ideas and had the guitar parts trimmed down due to Steve Hackett's absence, the truth is that it works just fine the way it is - I for one wouldn't want to change a thing on this marvelous album full of richly textured and layered songs that kind of blend into each other perfectly. Throughout the album one can sense a particular mood, an aura, something that unifies all 11 songs and makes them sound stronger together. It's definitely one of those albums benefited by repeated listening too.<br /><br />My guess is that Tony Banks, Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford actually got more focused working as a trio and had to work double time for that. \\"...And Then There Were Three\\" clearly shows their individual talents and that alone is a superb achievement for a band which had lost two key members only very recently at the time. They were all at the top of their game: Phil Collins really finds his voice here and drums masterfully; Tony Banks provides truly wonderful passages and melodies; while Mike Rutherford rounds it off perfectly on guitar and bass.<br /><br />Of course there are standout tracks but I'm not sure whether I should list any favourite ones as \\"...And Then There Were Three\\" should really be taken as whole. That's how I approach it: from the first to the last note it's a highly emotional trip I'm willing to take any time.
0393338827|4.0|\\"What a great look at the implosion of the subprime market. It is highly technical in concept, but not overly technical in my opinion so for most audiences it is a great read. I appreciate this situation and the players in it a lot more now that I have read this book.\\"
1427210497|2.0|I tried to finish this audiobook. I truly did. But the story is so long, so tedious, and so convoluted, that by the fifth disc I'd forgotten what happened in the first disc. I won't say that the book isn't well written ... but I don't know if it's suited to the audiobook format.
0784011214|5.0|An amazing movie.  Not just the best Rambo flick of all time, but also one of the best action movies of all time.  Makes anyone proud to be an american.  Rambo truly shows how the unfinished business in Vietnam should be taken care of.  Bravo!!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Although the Epic is alot more difficult to conquer than the original, it is definitely not impossible.  It's super addictive and tons of fun.  If you are up for an entertaining challenge this toy will not disappoint.     *Recommend!

B003V6L94Q|5.0|This is outstanding country music for every generation.  Zac Brown's style mixes traditional country music themes and melodies with a flavor of reggae and sharp instrumentals of bluegrass to produce music that is lively, flowing, entertaining, and infectious.  He adds vocals that perfectly support the music and the lyrics.  The Zac Brown Band could well be the future of country music.
B000002LIM|5.0|Great movie scores provide a shorter escapade into the emotions elicited by the movies from which they come.  Batman is no exception.  The underlying music for the action scenes, especially, takes me back into a movie that I haven't seen for a while.  Elfman handily weaves two tunes by other composers into a few sections of the score in such a way, that if one did not know better, one would assume that these themes were Elfman's own. A well-crafted score that serves well both as a background to the film and as a stand-alone CD, this Batman score is a welcome addition to any music collection.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Who would have ever thought that AMC would become one of the premiere channels for great narrative TV?!? Between [[ASIN:B000YABIQ6 Mad Men]], [[ASIN:B001DJLCRC Breaking Bad]] and The Walking Dead, they've made a very strong case for being a channel people simply can't live without. Although I have AMC I missed the broadcast showing of The Walking Dead so I was quite pleased to see it out on DVD.<br /><br />The DVD features all 6 episodes of the first season of The Walking Dead.  The show does pretty well in a marathon or by splitting it up between the two discs. Either way you'll want to block out some time to watch this series as it is very addictive and it's hard to just watch one episode.<br /><br />The Walking Dead plays more like a movie to start than a TV show and in the first half of the series the effects are top notch. The sheer number of people they have cast as zombies is impressive. The Walking Dead does very well when compared to other zombie films with great action, suspense and tons of gore.  On top of all that is a nice character driven story which holds together quite well with characters that you get to know and like.<br /><br />I went into watching The Walking Dead after hearing a lot of hype around the series and often things just don't live up to that kind of hype. The Walking Dead absolutely lived up to the buzz, it's a fantastic show that I will definitely be watching when it comes back on air for Season 2.

0393061310|5.0|I never enjoyed history in early grades where it was primarily memorizing names, dates and places. In later grades and in college I grew to love history as the focus became why things happened, what influenced the decision makers. Originally I thought of influences in terms of ideas and cultures. What I loved about Guns, Germs, and Steel is that it opened my eyes to the influence geography, zoology, biology and other scientific fields have had. Previously these influences were lingering in the background but this book has greatly raised their importance, its a fascinating new lens to view history through.
B004G6009U|4.0|This movie is Disney's--Glenn Keane's(with CEO Robert Iger & John Lasseter of Pixar)--attempt and desire to go back to the Classic Walt Disney formula.  After Katzenberg's departure from Disney Animation (and now we have another great Animation Studio in Dreamworks!), Disney lost its way with some very sub-par story/animation with a few gems in between (Tarzan, Lilo & Stitch, etc.)<br /><br />According to [[ASIN:0811875555 The Art of Tangled]] Glenn Keane (Character Supervisor for Little Mermaid, Tarzan, Alladin, Beast, etc.) was tasked to create \\"Rapunzel\\" but later they wanted to create a \\"parody\\" version of the Princess theme (I think [[ASIN:B0049GYXCC Enchanted [Blu-ray]]] might have come out from that endeavor) but Glenn Keane refused to work on such a project and pushed for a return to a classic Walt Disney ideal of the Fairy Tale story which Disney is known for.<br /><br />The Current Disney CEO Robert Iger approved and supported this move and decided to bring all the old school Disney Feature Animation people into this project:<br />- Executive Producer: Glenn Keanne (also Character designer) and John Lasseter (Pixar)<br />- Music by Alan Menken (Alladin, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, etc.)<br />- Directed by Dan Cooper and David Goetz (Chicken Little, Lion King, Bolt, too many!)<br /><br />and thus we have Disney's first try in a long time to go back to the their roots.<br /><br />I think this is for the best, as Disney Feature Animation will be able to put out their classics again while Pixar (part of Disney now) will be able to work on their more creative endeavors because John Lasseter runs both departments now!<br /><br />Tangled thus, although not the BEST, made me come out of the movie theater thinking \\"Disney is Back!\\"  Yes, there are a lot of things to criticize on in this movie; music might not be up to par with their previous classics, story is not as deep and might be predictable, but I think that's the Disney Fairy Tale formula, (Ariel didn't die at the end of The Little Mermaid like the original story!) It just makes you feel good at the end and makes you want to watch this over and over.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Disney's classic Feature Animation (by classic I also mean 80-90's not only their old school ones) then you'll definitely enjoy this animation if you are not too critical... and if you're a fan of the video game Left 4 Dead 2, you might notice a certain frying pan haha.original story!)

B004LSJCJM|4.0|I have been a Joe B fan since the beginning, and love his guitar playing. He is also growing as a songwriter. This is another very good album from him, chock full of good songs and great guitar work.   The only weak spot on this album for me is Tennessee Plates, and I like John Hiatt, but this song just does not work on this album in my opinion. What he should have done with it was released it as a single for the contemporary country music radio stations , it would be a big hit there I'm sure, but for me it is a bad fit for Dust Bowl.
B001FB5634|2.0|I'm sure to get a lot of \\"not helpful\\" votes for a title like this, but whatever...<br /><br />I'm giving this movie 2 stars just because in my opinion it had really high production value, it cost a lot of money to make things look that bad. And as a result, I believed in the surroundings/world/costumes. I also believed in the flashback scenes which addressed the subject/questions concerning suicide/survival vs. \\"living\\". And I liked the special features included with the DVD.<br /><br />Warning: The rest of my review contains spoilers<br /><br />But I just can't give it more than 2 stars because I did not believe the characters of the Man & Boy. And they make up like 80% of the content here.<br /><br />Hollywood pretty much made a film with NO STORY. And I do enjoy character driven movies. But this one fell flat. The characters do little or no development over the course of their travels. The Boy gets more vocal concerning morals, but that is about it. It is very hard to like either Man or Boy. And I was left not caring what happens to them in the end. This film could have covered the same subjects & development in about 1/3 the time.<br /><br />I guess it is possible for two such high strung and whiney people to survive this long (about 12 years) after the end of times as we know them, but no one would make a movie about them. I hated how the Man was so freaked out all the time that his first reaction to danger was to hold a gun to his kids head. This happens several times. I understand that going down in this version of the world would be better than being taken hostage and eaten. But wait to hold up the gun until danger is actually in the room with you. Geeze! And I could not believe that this kid appeared to be 12 and born after all the SHTF, but was a total loser. The flashback scenes do imply that they were able to live in a house for a long time before Momma leaves and the man-folk hit the road. But I cannot believe Boy was so sheltered by his parents that he was unprepared to survive. The Man even goes so far to bring up the subject that he will not always be around to take care of the Boy, so Boy better learn to take care of himself. Why wasn't he already trained to do that since diapers? In caveman days he would have been out doing his own thing by age 12. I just could not suspend my disbelief that far throughout the movie. I was ready to strangle the Boy by end of hour one.<br /><br />What would have been a lot more interesting would have been the story of the family that the Boy joins at the end of the movie (if you believe they are even real). How long did they follow the Man&Boy? How did they go without being detected? Why where they \\"worried\\" about the Boy enough choose him to adopt? What were their motivations to wait to approach until the father died? How the heck did they keep a dog alive when all other animals had died? Were their kids whiney brats too, or could they pull their own weight and stand up for themselves? Yup, a lot more interesting.<br /><br />Glad I got this one from the Library.<br /><br />******************************************<br />Update a year later: I finally \\"read\\" the book on CD from the Library. It was a little less of a steaming pile of crap than the movie, but not by much. I can give the Man a little more respect, and Boy did come off as on the verge of death from malnutrition. But while their repeated conversations could be realistic for two people in such a state, I still could not understand WHY the book was written. NOTHING interesting happens as far as action/events, no one grows as a person, learns anything meaningful, or passes on wisdom to a younger generation. So what was the point of the story??? One of my good friends called it an extreme example of navel gazing. I have to agree. This story just didn't do anything for me on the page or on the screen.e was unprepared to survive.

0061997811|5.0|\\"Film Wizardry\\" is a book that works well on so many levels. You can treat it as a coffeetable book, full of photos from all the Harry Potter movies. You can view it as a behind-the-scenes look at the movies (though if truth be told, the various extras on all the 2-DVD sets already do a great job at that). You can look at it as a wonderful treasury-style gift for a special young person's birthday or holiday. You could also value it as an incredible inspiration for anyone who is into crafts and DIY propmaking for amateur movies or roleplaying. The book contains not only close-up photos of props and costumes but also has various replicas of several paper props we see in passing in the movies. The Marauder's Map, Harry's invitation to Hogwarts, a guide booklet for the Quidditch World Cup, various potion labels, etc are all here for you to enjoy and use if you wish. I can easily imagine someone who is into a live-action roleplaying game going nuts for days here, because these high-quality reproductions are a wellspring of inspiration. On top of this, the beautiful design of the book from a layout perspective will keep you coming back to it to reread and to enjoy many, many times.     I attended the travelling exhibition of Harry Potter film props and I can vouch for the accuracy and the quality of the prop reproductions in this package. This is the rare fantasy film book that both fans and nonfans will enjoy and find useful. I really cannot recommend this book enough.
B002ZG99N6|3.0|The film itself is well-made, though utterly predictable, thief-with-the-golden-heart stuff.  And of course, for those of us who either live in Boston, or are familiar with the area(s), it adds another element of enjoyment.<br /><br />But for me, the best thing about this film is the memory I have with my wife, of being at Fenway Park, for the world(?) premier.  This was the scene (after fighting traffic into the city):<br />Outside the park, there's a huge line, with folks waiting to see the stars, and hoping to possibly get a \\"golden ticket\\" into the event; a massive screen erected in the famous ballpark, with the cityscape of Boston above and around it; free popcorn and drinks for everyone; lots of projection and sound equipment, paparazzi, and all sorts of artsy folks who probably know people, who know people, etc.; and everyone got a free black blanket with THE TOWN (in red) embroidered upon it (it's still in the trunk of my car).  Ben Affleck, along with a large number of the cast, as well as pal Matt Damon with his pregnant wifey, all showed up for the event. It was really fun, though we thought seriously about trying to scalp the tickets to the frothing fans outside. I'm sure we could've bagged several hundred dollars for them.  Thanks to my pal Christopher for giving us the tickets.
B000006XSD|5.0|\\"My God,\\" the last song in Lace and Whiskey can be seen as a powerful hymn - and, I believe, the first of Cooper's blatantly religious lyrics.  In it, Cooper shows love and appreciation of the love of his God.  The quality of the lyrics are comparable to the poetry of 16th/17th Century hero Rev. Dr. John Donne in his Holy Sonnets.  On a very personal note, this album was released at the time I converted to Christianity; as a brand new Christian, I was helped tremendously by Cooper's lyrics then.  Today, I listen repeatedly to this song for refreshment of my soul.[[ASIN:1420934376 The Complete Poems of John Donne]]
B00127RAJY|5.0|I used to workout every day but I hurt my back at work a couple of years ago. I've gained quite a bit of weight and have been slowly getting back into exercising. I have been doing this workout for 3 weeks and I love it! I've only lost 10 pounds but the inches are literally melting away. Especially in my arms, sides, and waist. I'm getting married next month and I had to get a new dress because I've already dropped 3 sizes. It's hard, but worth it!
B002GHHHP6|5.0|At first I thought I would dislike the 1994 movie version of my favorite TV Western, but I ended up loving it.  The script is a hoot and a half, filled to the brim with plot twists, gorgeous scenery, excellent costuming, and great performances.  Mel Gibson makes a fine Bret Maverick; he has Bret behaving as I would expect the character to do in certain situations, and I loved watching poor Bret being driven up a wall by everybody calling him \\"Bert\\". Jodie Foster is great as Annabelle Bransford, a sly con-artist who looks and acts so much like Samantha Crawford, an equally sly con-artist from the old \\"Maverick\\" series, that it wouldn't have surprised me one bit if it had been revealed that Annabelle was Samantha's own daughter.  James Garner is wonderful as Bret Maverick, Sr. (aka lawman Zane Cooper); watching him reprise the role that made him famous was like returning to my younger days of enjoying many TV Westerns.  The riverboat gambling tournament was nostalgic and sprinkled with familiar -- if fleeting -- faces from TV Westerns past:  Robert Fuller (Laramie), Doug McClure (The Virginian), Henry Darrow (The High Chaparral), Leo Gordon (a Warner Brothers contract player who appeared on many of ABC's Westerns in the late 1950s/early 1960s).  The dialogue is too modern-day in some spots (the Amerindian character Joseph talks like he's from the 21st century), but they couldn't have done this Western like one from the 1950s or it would have been too archaic for today's movie-goers.  The language is saltier, of course, but that was to be expected and I didn't have a problem with it.  Yet there's one line of dialogue in the scene where the younger Bret Maverick confronts the bandits who robbed a missionary wagon train.  They're busy calling him \\"Bert\\" when suddenly one of them says, \\"You're all right, Bart.\\"  A funny misprounciation, yes, but I believe it's also a nod to the late Jack Kelly, who co-starred with James Garner in the \\"Maverick\\" TV series as Bart Maverick,the brother of Bret Sr.

B003S9W8EQ|2.0|Although I persevered and read this whole, long book, I didn't really like it.  I felt ripped off, that my time for reading another really good book was gone forever, wasted.  But, my son had read it, and I had determined that I would see it through.  I did not read Pillars of the Earth but saw the series on TV that was based on it.  The benefit of the series, although not historically accurate as I would have liked, was that it could leave out the tedious, banal parts. I doubt that I will read another Ken Follett book as a result.  THERE ARE TOO MANY GREAT BOOKS TO READ, AND SO LITTLE TIME!!!
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I really enjoy watching the first season. Stories are good, characters are well developed , actors are all talented in both acting and singing, and they have good chemistry in them as a team. This is decently one of the best TV series!
B004HO6HWK|4.0|Well I havent seen the original.. so i am reviewing only on this movie on its own merit!  I thought it was a great movie... good plot... good action.... buying on Bluray right now.. because i cant wait to see it again.
B004SEVPWQ|1.0|it's the 1st time that my HTC Evo 4G froze up because of this game and i needed to remove the battery just to reboot it.
B00006CXSS|4.0|This series does a great job of telling the story of easy company, but it does have its flaws. The action sequences, reenactments, and special effects are top notch. There's a lot to enjoy here. The acting is very good as well. I would say that the quality is on the same level as Saving Private Ryan. I love the period and the costumes; they did a great job there.    My biggest complaint with the series is the language. It seems the directors wanted to make the period palatable for \\"modern\\" audiences. It's over the top at times. Even the real Captain Winters commented on the language, I believe. Beyond the language is the overall Hollywood feel of the characters. Many of the soldiers just don't act like what I'd expect a 1940's soldier to act.    One key point I keep disliking is when Capt. Winters shoots the young German SS soldier on the \\"Island Charge.\\" What you see is a complete fabrication. That didn't happen. Winters in fact threw a grenade at the sentry, and the sentry threw a grenade back. Winter's grenade didn't go off, so he shot the German sentry, alerting the rest of the Germans to his presence.     Another point where they missed it is in the ending, when the German officer offers Winters his pistol as a token of his surrender. In the series, Winters allows the officer to keep his sidearm. In reality, Winters accepted his sidearm.    Why would the producers go through so much to keep the movie authentic and then totally goof at these points? Some would argue that these events happened at other points in the war. I would counter that while they may have happened in other parts of the war, they didn't happen in Easy Company, and fiction should not be passed off as truth. Just stick with the facts - is that too difficult?    All considered, this is an excellent production, and there are some real gems to glean from this series. One thing that struck me is how much was sacrificed for our freedoms (especially in the Bastogne episode). Another nugget is the importance of effective leadership. Without a good leader, the team was unable to do what they needed to do. With a good leader, easy company was able to surmount overwhelming odds.    All in all, Good.
030746363X|5.0|I am very impressed with the research that was done for this book, it is written with a sense of humor as well a technical info. The best part is, I lost 10 lbs in the first week, and still enjoyed Binge day...you have to get the book to find out what that is. it is so simple yet makes so much sense...worth every penny.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|Great app for storing notes.  The last update deleted all my existing notes during installation, so I'm not happy. Fortunately I make backups and only lost a few days worth of notes.
B0036TGSR6|2.0|Ok acting. Thin plot. I never got this movie, and it wasn't really suspenseful or entertaining, or much of anything. There's a ghost writer for memoirs who goes to a beautiful house on the beach where his subject lives. The writer isn't the first in this job and his predecessor died, probably was murdered. By whom, and why? There's a mystery around that and the tension lies in the writer, who isn't an investigative reporter, acting like he is one except that he seems to have not an ounce of common sense considering the situation. I didn't really care about any of the characters as I didn't really learn much about any of them. Kim Cattrell seemed to do a good job in a fairly minor role that was reminiscent of Kim Novak in a Hitchcock movie.
B001YV504U|4.0|This is a great movie and I was having problems finding it on Blu ray locally. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that right after I purchased it from Amazon, Bestbuy got it in stock and is selling it for a couple dollars less.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|My first impression of these headphones was a general improvement in overall sound signature for most music. Without being relentlessly revealing, they still provide an extremely good amount of detail in music you might otherwise never hear. They're large but not unwieldy, contain a fairly long 10 ft. cord, but unfortunately can't be folded up. Portability is probably not the best of the bunch but they will fit nice and snug in your briefcase or backpack if you're a college kid like me. Burning in provides a better bass response over time and it supposedly tightens out with the aid of an amp. (I'm satisfied though) Comfort can be a little exaggerated on some of the reviews here, and while I will say it's very good, I can't honestly vouch for being able to wear these prolonged periods of time without any discomfort. Everyone's ears are different but I find the fake pleather to be an unfortunate choice of material because it causes my ears to sweat. I'm considering buying a pair of velour replacement pads from the manufacturer though so hopefully that will yield some improvement. For 90 to 100 bucks you can't go wrong.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I bought this to use with my computer.  Basically my headphones were just not loud enough.  My computer and headphones both use 3.5mm jacks, the same size that a portal MP3 player would use.  The jacks on this device are 1/4 inch which are the 'old' style big holes.  I just used 2 adapters and this thing works great, 1/4\\" Male to 1/8\\" Female or 6.5mm male to 3.5mm female.  They are like 3 bucks each here on amazon with free shipping.  Previously I could have my computer set to max sound and had a hard time listening to some movies or shows on Hulu or Netflix, but with this amp I only have to turn it up about a third of the way, it can get REALLY loud.  At high volumes the sound does lose quality but if you are listening to stuff that loud you are probably hard of hearing anyways.<br /><br />I feel that this device in no way improves the quality of the sound, it just makes it louder and that is what I was looking for.  Just make sure you either buy adapters with it or that you already have the right source and headphones.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|There's really no way to review a work like this. It's Sherlock Holmes. I'm not sure how much more light needs to be thrown on these stories for future readers. They're mysteries. They take place in Victorian England. The mysteries are solved by Sherlock Holmes, a deductive genius who uses things like \\"observational skills\\" and \\"knowledge\\" to figure out impossibly twisted tales. He has a friend named Watson who narrates most of the stories. Really that's it. Only Holmes is also a master of disguise, a boxer, bi-polar and a drug addict. Which is fun when viewed through a 100 year old lens. Also this book contains ALL of the Holmes stories, something I knew in theory when I downloaded it, but didn't really grasp until I was three quarters of the way through and had minutia about tobacco ash and the streets of turn-of-the-century England falling out of my ears. There are a lot of these stories and since I couldn't very well STOP reading them it got to be a bit like overkill. But that's probably my fault for needing devour them all.  Otherwise these are some of the best mysteries ever written solved by one of the greatest characters ever created. No need to say more.
B003ZHVJFA|4.0|out of all the fighter movies made from games this might be as good or even the best one yet.  its crazy how they got the characters to look likie the vg ones.  the plot is as open as the games but thats what it should be.  dont go throwing incrap that dpesntneed to bed there!

Him and I have grown up loving comics and he is about to have kids of his own soon and would love to share his love for comics with them. So I thought this would be a prefect gift.   He and everyone else at his part young and old love the gift. I think its great art work inside and the folding is very well. The Bat Signal light in the middle of the book is a great touch as well.     I recommend this for any lover of the Dc Comic Universe and any comic lover out there at all. Young and old.     Trent K.

0670022411|1.0|Great first page! Pretty good first 50 pages. Then it gets boring. REALLY boring. Nothing happens. Really. Nothing, for the rest of the book. And if that were not bad enough, the main character is the weakest female character I've ever encountered. I could not imagine trying to read any more! Even David Eddings last series had more story development!
0439023483|5.0|Hunger games came onto my radar about three years ago shortly after I read [[ASIN:0385737955 The Maze Runner (Maze Runner Trilogy, Book 1)]] and [[ASIN:0385613709 Nation]]. I felt so 'meh' about those other books I didn't think Hunger Games would inspire me.<br /><br />Then I attended SCBWI Western Washington conference and the editor that worked with Suzanne Collins spoke about the book in one of the session and I thought \\"Of course she'd love a book that was her project.\\"<br /><br />Then a parade of people started telling me how good the books were and I should give it a shot...but still no.<br /><br />Then I read an excellent excerpt for this year's Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award (Ceres Wrath) and I mentioned it to my cousin who was like \\"Read the dang Hunger Games trilogy already!\\"<br /><br />So I bought it on Kindle and read it in about 48hrs on my Droid2 phone despite sleep deprivation from getting ready for a trip and having a 15mo old at home.<br /><br />I freaking LOVED it!<br /><br />Ms. Collins is a master craftsperson with constructing this scifi/fantasy/dystopic/adventure tale. Her characters were believable and made me care. The plot, the explanation of this world was completely acceptable for me and made every aspect of this tale from Buttercup to Jabberjays from Madge to Octavia endearing and irreplaceable.<br /><br />Katniss was the anti-Bella for YA as far as I'm concerned. She still dwelt on and dealt with many 'teenage' issues, but was so firm in her convictions and desire to survive she had to push aside frivolity, though her participation in the games shoved that frivolity right back down her throat.<br /><br />Overall, I am rarely ever so completely satisfied with every aspect of a novel as I am with this one. The only sad thing about it was I waited soooo long to read it.
030746363X|5.0|As I was walking to my car yesterday I had the strange sensation that I was walking down a hill.  Then I realized that I was nowhere near a hill and the strange sensation I was feeling was the result of me being 40 lbs lighter thanks to the diet outlined in this book.  After my second knee surgery in February 2011 I decided it was time to lose some weight.  I saw Tim Ferris on the Dr Oz show and decided to give this diet a try. Coming fresh off a knee surgery There was not a whole lot of excersize I could do right away and with this diet excersize is not essential to lose weight. It will obviously speed the process up but you will lose weight with the diet alone.  I have been on the diet for 3 Months now and have lost 40 lbs.  The diet is easy to follow and you dont have to eat cardboard to see the weight fall off.  I highly recommend not only this diet but also everything in this book to anyone who wants to lose weight or just improve your life/health overall.  I already have everyone in my office wanting to try the diet after seeing my results in such short time. BUY IT. It will change your life.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one that you can read over and over again without growing tired of it. It is a simply wonderful book and an amazing concept. Chbosky has created such a unique character with a fresh. outstanding voice. the book accurately portrays adolescence and teenage angst. The songs mentioned in this book are also fabulous. Definitely one of my favorite books.
B000000OQF|1.0|This is like Spinal Tap, only Spinal Tap has value because they are funny. The worst, most boring collection of heavy-metal cliches imaginable.
B0042FZWC0|4.0|An interesting book about someone with a very different view of how to live than me.  I was interested in the book both because I am approaching retirement and am wondering what to do next and to try an understand one of my kids, who lives more like the author than me.  The book is well written and easy to read, but does not guide you towards any specific career.  It does guide you towards working for yourself and only working as much as you need to support the lifestyle that you want to live.  After reading the book I'm not sure that Mr. Guillebeau (and my kid) don't have the right idea, and I've spent way too many years working swing shift.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Seriously.  The first three originals were great.  Every new product seems to get further and further away from that.  If you really like Star Wars, just enjoy the memories you have of what they used to be instead of the cruel torture of watching these \\"fixed\\" versions.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was just skimming Kindle Store for good science fiction and stumbled on this.  With over 2,000 reviews, I figured it must have something going for it.  Wow!  How did it happen I missed this for so long?  I found out it was even required reading for one of my nephew's college classes!  Read it; you'll love it.
B000UWWLGE|1.0|This anodyne slurry of surrealistic sounds is perfect background music for any place or situation where you don't want to have complete silence, but you want your customers distracted without them being mentally elevated or achieving emotional transcendence, as more coherent music is known to do. Dentists' waiting rooms, elevators, office lobbies, Starbucks...all of these places are perfect forums for this album. Anesthetize your clientele!<br /><br />It's no surprise that Davis found such favor with his existentialist buddies, like Sartre, in newly liberated Paris. The obscurantist philosophers who preached that everything is nothing, that there is no meaning, that subjectivity is the only truth, naturally took delight in the utter formlessness and primitivism of le jazz. Those Communists thought it a bonus that it was produced by the oppressed Negro, and so the leftist cultural illuminati of America followed the lead of the Party. But since the time has long passed since listening to Jazz made a political_statement_about one's self, I wonder if anyone really listens to it anymore, besides European poseurs and a smattering of guilty White American liberals.
0451228375|5.0|World Without End is a wonderfully written, historical novel that carries you through many different characters' lives from beginning to--in many cases--their end.  This was the first Follet novel I had read and I have already consumed Dangerous Fortunes and Pillars of the Earth, trying to decide where to go next.  Follet handles his characters so realistically that you find you can truly sympathize with even the most cruel and unforgiving types, since even they have a few redeeming factors and as in reality, even the most awful never see themselves that way.  If you enjoy the English fourteenth century--as brutal and overzealous as it was--then you will love this book! Follet does a remarkable job with  the many details of each of his characters so that you actually find yourself learning a great deal about how buildings and bridges are built from written sketches through completion--and find it interesting.  He also does a wonderful job of showing how names evolved from after the time of the Dooms Day Books--Caris Wooler, Merthin Bridger, John Constable, et al.   Highly recommended to anyone who loves a great historical novel.
B001FB4W16|5.0|Love the show, it is one that you can miss a couple of episodes and still get back into it.
B004KWVDWI|5.0|If you have been following up on such famous literary personages you will have discovered that Henri Charrieres stories of his escapades have been attributed more to tales he heard from other prisoners rather his own experience. In fact French records show him not to have been in certain locations as he claimed throughout French Guinea. Other prisoners who knew have flat out called him a liar. This bummed me out to now end since I had read the book and its sequel Banco many time over till I heard the true story unfold.      That said the movie is a great action story. Steve McQueen's performance is raw and he is totally submerged in the role. His interaction with bestial authoritarians and attempts to escape while dealing with all sorts of shady despicable characters that make him appear to be almost saintly  really keeps you on edge. Even though he was no honest citizen you do cheer for him to escape a penal system more akin to the Japanese POW camps of WW2 or Vietnamese POW camps for Americans  Dustin Hoffmans role as a forger who develops an unlikely bond with Papillion is acted with restraint as being a forger he now is at the mercy of people who committed more violent crimes then just printing false bonds. He has money and Papillon has the street smarts and together they both hope to escape.   I never tire of this movie. Its fast paced and beautifully filmed. A must see again and again.
B0042KC4VW|5.0|I am not sure what is going on but I bought the episode to watch through amazon and for some reason it's not working. I love the show and I highly recommended it but I suggest finding some other way to watch. I just got ripped off of my money. I didn't think that Amazon would allow people to buy episodes when they have no way of letting you watch it, guess I was wrong. I can only hope they will choose to fix the problem.
B002UJIY7A|2.0|There's nothing more disappointing than paying for one thing and recieveng another.    I paid for a new DVD and the one I rec'd was definitely USED!    The packaging was warped all over as if it had been dropped in water or got too hot somewhere!    It's the ugliest DVD in my collection...ugh!    The movie was great; that's why I ordered it. This was my 1st and last DVD from Amazon.......so disappointed!!    I doubt this will get posted!!!!!  BEWARE!
B004TB6GQI|5.0|Christina Perri's Love Strong is an amazing cd.  The First time I heard her smash hit, Jar or Hearts, I was head over heels in love with her voice.  It didn't take me long to buy her cd and disappointed I was not.  Unlike a lot of cds where only a few songs are good and the rest are subpar, each song from this cd is great.  I highly recommend the delux cd over the regular because the added tracks are just that much better.  So what are you waiting for?   Go buy the cd and enjoy it as much as I did.
B004QPOVE6|4.0|I have been an AC/DC fan since I was 8 years old.  That is a lot of years now.  (I'm 43)<br />I collect nearly everything I can concerning AC/DC.  Yes, all album cover variants, etc.  My wife loves me.<br /><br />This video is very good.  The crowd in Argentina is really what made it good.<br />The set list is pretty standard live stuff.<br />Shot down in flames, and dog eat dog are a nice change of pace, and harken back to the earlier Bon material.  Well Dog Eat Dog is earlier Bon material.  Shot down in flames is from Highway to Hell, which was Bon's last album with the band.<br /><br />The band does a good job of chugging through the set list, and the crowd eats it up.<br />Interestingly, over the past few tours, Brian seems to be taking over a bit of the spotlight from Angus.  This is understandable, considering their age, and the effort it takes to pull off the antics Angus does every night.  Frankly, I like the balance, as Brian is a loveable ham, and does a solid job of engaging the crowd while not overdoing it.<br />Angus has really toned down the head bobbing and racing all over the stage.  Still breaks out the Chuck Berry duck walk now and then, but his act is half of what is was when he was a younger man.  Still kills it on the guitar!<br /><br />I still feel that Live at Donington is their best live video in the Brian era.  Granted, they were much younger, and the show had a bit more energy; which I guess is what struck me about this video.  The lads are getting old, and it shows a bit.  Don't get me wrong, I couldn't do what they do night after night on these gigantic tours they pull off.  I guess it was a harsh dose of reality that myself and the band are getting old.<br /><br />While I agree to a point with some of the reviews regarding the camera angles, I didn't find it too distracting.  Especially when they would get a shot of some of the lovely ladies of Argentina in the crowd.<br /><br />I enjoyed the DVD, and will forever love this band.<br />Fans casual or otherwise will want to add this to their collection..

1594481717|2.0|Forget the left brain/right brain thing which is an outdated metaphor.  Within this review I will ignore it.  Modern neuroscience suggests this categorization of the brain hemispheres is not accurate.  This book is really about thinking well; but, it adds little vs better books written decades ago such as Michael Gelb's [[ASIN:0440508274 How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci: Seven Steps to Genius Every Day]] and Edward De Bono [[ASIN:0060903252 Lateral Thinking: Creativity Step by Step (Perennial Library)]].<br /><br />Pink makes a lot of false assumptions.  He considers that the vast majority of white collar professionals (doctors, lawyers, engineers, analysts, programmers) lack any creative thinking ability.  He ignores that they are problem solvers.  And, problem solving is very creative.  Pink relies on studies that supposedly conclude that IQ accounts for only 4% of career success.  Meanwhile, the vast majority of successful people most probably have IQs of 125+ (95th percentile and above).  He advances that a Masters in Fine Arts (MFA) is more valuable and better recognized than an MBA.  Later, he quotes someone stating that they prefer poets to MBAs for managers.  Another time, he mentions Australian parents stating they would rather have their children go into nursing than software engineering.  Also, he quotes an executive \\"GM is in the art business.\\"  Somehow, Pink loves to refer to the nonsensical.<br /><br />Pink misses the linkage between job functions.  He advances that design is now the master discipline that only creative types can practice proficiently and is leaving all white collar professionals behind.  He forgets that for any one product designer you need several patent lawyers, business plan forecasting accountants, mechanical engineers, and programmers.  And, that these professionals solve related issues that are just as creatively challenging as the product designer.<br /><br />Another flawed assumption Pink makes is that Indians (from India) are just like American white collar professionals not creative.  He was wrong about the Americans.  He is wrong about the Indians.  He goes on about all the routine jobs being outsourced to India.  He ignores some of the leading consulting firms are Indian.  And, these compete already for the most lucrative product development projects worldwide.  It is not just the rote stuff that can get outsourced.<br /><br />Pink when he is not wrong deals with truisms.  His chapter on Empathy smacks of that.  Doctors should be more empathetic.  Women are more empathetic than men.  \\"Sometimes we need detachment; many other times we need attunement.\\"  Ok, how many more truisms do you need to read over 30 pages?  The chapter on Play is also somewhat truistic.  Yet, you probably won't feel like joining a laughing club.  Aren't Woody Allen movies good enough for that?<br /><br />Pink has also a world macroeconomic/demographic vision that is off.  Everything is about outsourcing and automating.  If you are a (supposedly noncreative) white collar type, you will soon be replaced by either software or someone in Bangalore.  No wonder Thomas Friedman considers it \\"my favorite business book.\\"  This is because it supports his own [[ASIN:B00327JV3K The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century]] vision.  Although superficially convincing, both Pink and Friedman are off.  Instead, a far more relevant framework is Richard Florida's.  He thinks the world is actually getting increasingly spikier with ever greater concentration of well educated people in just a few cities worldwide.  That is because of the network effect.  Knowledge workers cluster in specific areas: venture capitalists in Palo Alto, petroleum engineers in Houston, financiers in London, advertising types in Chicago.  The Internet has done nothing to flatten those centers.  To the contrary, it has accelerated their concentration of talent.<br /><br />Richard Florida derives the relevant framework because he defines his creative class correctly by capturing all the problem solving white collar professionals Pink so denigrates (reference: [[ASIN:B000WCTPI4 The Rise of the Creative Class: And How It's Transforming Work, Leisure, Community and Everyday Life]]).  In Florida's books and blog (at the Atlantic), he constantly uncovers interesting relationships between his creative class and various positive economic outcomes precisely depicted with scatter plots and regression coefficients.  Meanwhile, Pink uses no supportive data and just refers to outlying studies that don't make sense (like IQ does not matter in career success).<br /><br />Pink sometimes brands his six senses using the wrong words.  For instance \\"Symphony\\" has little to do with music.  It has to do with synthesizing information.  A more accurate description would be simply: Synthesis.<br /><br />Occasionally, Pink's recommended activities have nothing to do with practicing his cognitive senses.  He thinks one of the best ways of learning synthesis is learning how to draw.  So, now on page 145 he manages to draw a portrait of Mark Wahlberg, the actor, that he confuses for his own (see his picture on page 167) and he thinks he is a good synthesis thinker.<br /><br />Finally, Pink's six senses won't help you much in your career more than they already do.  That's because you already are proficient at them.  In the body of the book, Pink forgets we are human beings with a life outside work that develops our abilities to tell stories, play, empathize, etc...  He recalls that only on the last page, when he states: \\"[His six senses] are fundamentally human attributes...  They reside in all of us, and need only be nurtured into being.\\"  Now, you know it.  You already do all that stuff.<br /><br />If you want to succeed do the opposite of what Pink suggests.  Instead of practicing telling stories or joining a laughing club study Marcus Buckingham's [[ASIN:0743201140 Now, Discover Your Strengths]].  You will uncover what you are good at and know how to get even better at it.

B00095NX9G|5.0|I have bellydanced on and off for years. There are a blue million basic and beginner bellydance dvds out there. I had started w/ the dvds by Veena and Neena, which was a great way to learn the very basics and get in shape. I loved Sensual Bellydance w/Blanca too. But searching for something a little more advanced, I got this. WOW! There is so much material on here. I love all the specific dance moves she teaches. I just rewind and go over and over until I have a move mastered. Very easy to follow, challenging and fun. I have done yoga alot too, and the yoga in this dvd is challenging but doable, I feel GREAT afterwards. I just had my second child and still carrying the baby pooch and feel like I've lost my stomach muscles, but I can actually feel and see them coming back, praise the Lord, with the help of this dvd. Can't wait to have the dances down so I can put them to my own music. Great value!
B003MQNENY|4.0|Nothing to add regarding the story, Brideshead is and will be, one of my favorite novels. A note about editions though; Waugh originally published Brideshead Revisited in 1945. Waugh wrote it during the war years and with time, developed a \\"growing dissatisfaction with its literary style. He found it too lush, too decorative or ornamental in too many places.\\" For me, that \\"lushness\\" is one of the reasons that I fell in love with the language of the novel. He republished the novel in 1959, with a number of the passages trimmed or \\"toned down\\". There are some additions as well but overall the novel is tightened up (although I would disagree with the author that his revised version is \\"better\\"). For more information you can read \\"Companion to Evelyn Waugh's 'Brideshead Revisited' by David Cliffe on the internet. Through a convoluted history, which need not be discussed here, the original or first edition is referred to as the \\"American\\" edition and the revised one is the \\"British\\" edition. I own both copies in hardback myself and find that both have merits but as previously stated, my preference is the original. I am glad to say that the Kindle version appears to be the original version. I have found the quickest way to tell which one you are reading is by going to Book I, Chapter 1 'Et in Arcadia Ego' (God knows how much has been written on that memento mori) and reading the first paragraph. In the original edition the words \\"fool's-parsley\\" is written and the phrase is \\"soft vapors of a thousand years of learning\\". In the revised edition, the fool's-parsley is eliminated and the phrase is changed to \\"soft airs of centuries of youth\\". Hope this helps as the original version available on the Kindle was the revised one. Which begs the question, for $9.68, why can't the publisher include both editions?
0316056863|5.0|I knew little about Tina Fey before I bought this book.  Yes, I live near Chicago and I knew she performed at Second City. But I had stopped watching SNL many years ago.  Then came the 2008 presidential election, and Tina Fey and Amy Poehler knocked all of us off our ****** with their Hillary vs. Sarah Palin show.  It was the greatest entertainment I'd seen in a long time.    So, \\"Bossy\\" Pants is a peek behind the curtain of the life and career of Tina Fey.  I learned a little about her family and formative years, her start in comedy, her current family life, and her relations with other TV and film professionals.  It is all funny and insightful, no tell-all, but fabulous fun.  It is a book in the style of Steve Martin's \\"Born Standing Up\\", and as pleasurable.  It is clear that she is more sane and more grounded than Liz Lemon, who is Feys' alter ego on \\"30 Rock\\", but she shares many of Liz's foibles.  Tina Fey is aggressively competitive and very proud of having proved her talent and slashed a path into the male (and very sexist) bastion of comedy. I didn't cry, but I did laugh, and that's what I was looking for when I bought the book, so, Thanks, Tina.  And give us another.
0470876417|4.0|Entrepreneur who is self styled, wants to know how to implement business models can brainstorm with this excellent book.

B002CIY8EM|5.0|To put it as short as possible - this book is awesome. It's sold millions of copies, and started several spin offs.<br /><br />Read it with an open mind as the book suggests alternative reasoning for popular cultural beliefs and tries to explain some of the unexplainable. First and foremost - have aliens visited the Earth in our distant past? Have beings from other worlds influenced ancient history such as the Egyptians and Mayans. Many unexplained great accomplishments remain unexplained after 12,000 years. The artistic references to other worldly beings in the bible - what could they mean?<br /><br />This is a fascinating book and please complement it with the DVD 'Ancient Aliens' also available on Netflix.
B003RRW7YK|5.0|I think there's bad TV, good TV, then stuff like Breaking Bad. Everything about this show is perfection - acting, writing, directing are top tier surpassing anything else currently on television. It proves that you don't need a big budget to be successful, you just need top notch story tellers and actors like this. This season defines of 'edge of your seat'.
0142418471|4.0|Will Grayson, Will Grayson is my first John Green book (I'm not sure how because I have all his other books on my bookshelf, but somehow I have yet to read them) and my second David Levithan book. It was fantastic. As the title suggests, the book is about two teens named Will Grayson. Both live in the suburbs of Chicago (one in Naperville, one in Evanston) but their lives are pretty different. The book alternates between their points of view, with them narrating alternating chapters; John Green's Will Grayson starts off the story, and you can tell David Levithan's Will Grayson because his chapters are written in all lowercase, no caps. The first Will Grayson is pretty shy and awkward, straight, and best friends with the biggest (both literally and figuratively) gay student at his school; the other Will Grayson is a loner from a poor home, obsessed with his online boyfriend. Coincidence leads them both to be in the same random porn shop in Chicago at the same time, where they meet.<br /><br />While the story is really well done, the characters are what really make Will Grayson, Will Grayson great. The two Wills are fully fleshed out and interesting to read; my favorite character by far, however, was Tiny Cooper. Tiny is by no means tiny, and neither is his loudly flamboyant personality; his life goal, as a matter of fact, is to put on a play about his life. This book is just all around fantastic, and is both a humorous and honest look at the high school experience, friendship, and self-acceptance.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|As soon as I found out that the Kindle application was available for Android without having to purchase a Kindle device, I was very excited.  It was one of the first apps I installed soon after I purchased my latest smartphone (LG Optimus V through Virgin Mobile USA).  So far, so good!  My only reservation is that I may not ever have enough time to read all the great books I've downloaded to my phone!
0060936223|4.0|I admittedly only really picked up Just Kids because it won the National Book Award, which made me curious about the book; beyond knowing a few of her songs (though I could mostly just recognize them, I couldn't have told you who they were by), I didn't really know anything about Patti Smith before picking up the book. I am so glad I read it though. The book is so much more than just a memoir of Patti and her years with Robert Mapplethorpe; it's a lyrical and poetic love story, and a story about youth, art, and friendship. Patti's writing is honest and raw, but still has the poetry of an artist. Before Robert Mapplethorpe's death, Patti had promised him that she would write about their years together in New York, their tumultuous and evolving friendship and love, and this book is just that. I was a bit of a skeptic about the book's popularity, but once I finally read it I could completely understand why it's received so much acclaim.
1593083343|5.0|Jane Austen has a lot of fans.  I am one of them.  My wife is another.  People have been arguing the merits of Austen's novels for quite a number of years now; some people love her work, others do not.  This is as it should be.  We can take this premise of love/hate Austen a step further though.  It has been my experience over the years that there is conflict even among those who love this writer's work and that everyone seems to have their favorite novel.  This is also only right.<br /><br />The problem is though that I have found people who read Jane Austen are also a very opinionated lot and quite often harsh words are spoken when discussing the strengths, merits, flaws, dislikes, etc. of Austen's various works.  Alas, I have to report to you that this is the case in our household; a normally peaceful place filled with tranquility and marital bliss...about 49 years of it...thank you very much!<br /><br />Yes, we are a family torn asunder.  My wife (silly girl) feels that Emma is Austen's best work, while I, who am far more knowledgeable of such matters, prefer her novel, Pride and Prejudice...of which I am sure most of you will agree....me, not her, i.e. my mistaken wife. (Emma, bless her heart, is such an aggravating little twit).<br /><br />Anyway, this is really not a review of Emma, the work (I will admit that it is a very fine read worthy of multiple readings ever few years), but rather that of the actual book edition on sale here.  I felt sorry for my wife when I saw her ragged copy stuffed into one of her already overly stuffed bookshelves and felt a new edition was in order.  I bought this one for her.<br /><br />For the asking price of this book, including S&H, I cannot for the life of me figure out why people are disgruntled and unhappy with it.  It is very well bound, the font is extremely readable, the quality of paper is quite good, the dust jacket is extremely attractive and all the pages were present.  I check the binding very closely when the book arrived, and again, for what I paid for this thing, it was excellent!  Trust me...I know about such things.

B000BTJDG2|1.0|The first time I saw this about a year ago, I really liked it a lot (I think I was high). However, upon recently viewing it again about a month ago, I noticed all of its flaws. The performance by Laura Linney is pathetic! She's so much better in a similar role (as an attorney) in \\"Primal Fear\\". And, the courtroom scenes played out like a tv movie, a Lifetime movie at that. And the dialogue was a joke! Laura Linney's character was reduced to simply saying \\"I object\\" every other second, with no REAL legal argument behind it, and the Judge would always agree with her.?.! It was so painful for anyone even remotely interested in legal thrillers to have to watch. There was not enough 'exorcism' footage shown to excite anyone, and the greatest scene in the film (in the barn) was way too brief. There were way too many loose ends left dangling, and things like the 3:00 A.M. phenomenon were never explained. Plus, it's never made clear as to whether Emily was really possessed or just an over imaginative anorexic teen whose religious fervor drove her to believe she was possessed. Oh, and the whole \\"Mother Mary\\" s**t at the end was just crap! Even if she was possessed, she might have had visions of Christ or the Devil, but not the dead Mary! Only Catholics (if you're Catholic, I mean no offense) believe that Mary was a Holy Figure, so that's another reason that scene was SO wrong for this film. Thank you. :>)
B003I55BIA|5.0|this is one of my favorite modern books! on my first read i thought it was so predictable, but the ending and plot was so much better than i anticipated!
B000H5TH1Q|5.0|As for De Palma, I need to review the entire catalog of his whenever I get the chance, for he (and Stephen King) helped me realize I see the world the way he does at a very young age when \\"Carrie\\" came out (I was 10 or 11). And, by the time I saw this one, I was 'De Palma-crazed', LOL. I love a lot of other filmmakers (especially Hitchcock and Kubrick), but Brian does that special 'something' that appeals to the manic depression in all of us. Plus, I love how he revels in enjoying other people's pleasures/perversions/fears/desires. With his unique visual style, and his ability to grab you from the very beginning, make Brian De Palma films 'dangerous yet seductive worlds', and I am glad to say that De Palma once again did not disappoint, and that he successfully delivered a very broad range of emotions that he takes viewers on in this film.<br /><br />I saw this when it came out, and I still remember it blowing the top of my head off! I have loved this film even more every time I view it (which is VERY often) over the years. I almost knew from the beginning where the story would take me but it did not stop me from enjoying the film and admiring De Palma's ability to trick me by making me see what he only wanted me to see, yet never hiding the whole picture. What a gruesome, poignant, satirical, often hilarious, and always remarkable movie it is. It is certainly De Palma's loving homage to his favorite Hitchcock, and not just to one but several of his movies. It is a sharp satire on Hollywood, of course, but first of all, it is the story told masterfully by the Master of Suspense, making daring use of his unique and fascinating visual style. It is a great sordid-noir film and is quite creepy at times, as well darkly hilarious, for it is a satire as well as a thriller. Be sure to watch for the scene that is a running parody of bad porno film trailers, and the 'glowing' reviews from critics! Hilarious & brilliant!<br /><br />While filming \\"Dressed To Kill\\" in 1979, Brian De Palma was first inspired to make this film. The notorious shower scene with Angie Dickinson (in full ala-nude), a 'body double' was brought in to stand in whenever it was showing Angie Dickinson from the neck down, nude. Great way to immediately throw you off balance as a viewer, symbolizing right away, don't trust what you are watching, for like a magician, at some point in this story he's gonna surprise you by making you believe you saw one thing but not another, while showing the viewer what they are seeing the entire time right before your very eyes! Vavoom!<br /><br />Of coarse this has rings and tones of \\"Rear Window\\" and \\"Vertigo\\" all through it (as well as a few other great Hitchcock thrillers, like \\"Shadow of A Doubt\\", \\"Dial M for Murder\\", \\"Rope\\", and \\"Marnie\\", which the latter featured Melanie Griffith's mom, Tippi Hedren), what better films to pay homage to???! It also has flourishes of the French, Italian, and European filmmakers that have inspired De Palma throughout as well. It has the perfect combination a psychological erotic thriller is supposed to have, all the right ingredients, from erotic fervor to dark sinister terror, from insane biting satire to leaving you breathless in despair. It's a Brian De Palma Showing...An event cause de celebrete....A classic work of film art.<br /><br />Anyways, he shelved the idea, working and writing on it between his next two classics, \\"Blow Out\\" (1981) and \\"Scarface\\" (1983).<br /><br />So, in 1984, Brian De Palma returned to the genre that only he does best: The erotic/psychological/suspense/mystery/thriller/satire. He fleshed out (no pun intended) a story only he could tell (he was initially just gonna produce it, but thank God he decided to direct it as well!).<br /><br />He throws the viewer off guard right away by starting the film making viewers believe they are about to see a good late night B-grade vampire flick, then immediately shows that it's only a movie starring the main character of De Palma'sfilm. Then, as the title of the film comes on screen, with an awesome desert background that is suddenly pulled away, revealing that it (the background) is just a matte painting for some movie backdrop. Right away, like The Magician, De Palma is revealing to not trust what you are about to see for the next two hours, even though it will be done right before your very eyes. The tagline was perfect for this film: \\"Don't believe everything you see\\".<br /><br />Jake Scully, our main character (played to perfection by Craig Wasson) is a claustrophobic, soon-to-be-out-of-work actor, who goes home after a bad day's shoot just to find his girlfriend in bed with someone else! And, if wonders never cease, the apartment is hers, so he goes packing.<br /><br />From staying with a friend, a local bartender, then moving through treacherous auditions (when he already \\"is working now, and that's what matters, isn't it?\\"), to have the skies depart when he befriends a chap between acting auditions and acting class, which plays out like Acting 101, with a 'psychiatric' acting teacher whose methods just may or may not be helpful or harmful, which one???! A very crucial scene there where Jake is told \\"You must act!\\", De Palma's way or reminding his audience that they must 'live', not just be a couch potato watching life go by, participate, act! And, then things get even better for Jake (this is his lucky day, let me tell you, LOL!), his new friend (played by the great Gregg Henry) is called away for an acting gig out of town, so he needs Jake to housesit the house he's subletting. Using a real house in L.A., it is beautifully built, shaped like a spaceship, and very high in the air, with windows all around it, brilliantly filmed. AWESOME!<br /><br />Then Jake is told and shown that his next door neighbor likes to do an erotic dance every night in front of her window, in full view of Jake and the handy telescope that is set in that sole position, aimed right at her house. And, Jake, being a person of very low self esteem, and just feeling he's back in the 'world', even though it's not a world to brag about. He IS living in L.A's dirty underbelly, getting only bit parts in lowrate, B-grade (possibly direct to video?) obscure films, but he lets his esteem and obsession for a better life get in the way, seeking solace by watching the lady next door do a very sexy striptease for two nights in a row, and even while she's sleeping (he knows when you're awake, ha-ha) he still likes to peep in on her, thus noticing at some point that someone else is also watching her.<br /><br />So, in a fanatic/obsessive/compulsive way, he starts to follow Gloria Revelle (played by the beautiful/talented Deborah Shelton), the lady that lives in the house across from his. It is here that De Palma really shines with his technique of 'pure cinema', 'visual storytelling', making use of extremely long takes, and long scenes, with no dialogue, lasting for over 20 minutes.<br /><br />There then is a seduction more wonderous than the clouds outside. Yes, there is such a thing as love at first sight! Gloria and Jake are similar in several ways. Both are claustrophobic, but in completely seperate terms of the word. Both live in a world of fear, dread, depression, despair, loneliness, in a seedy world of decadence, the beautifully filmed L.A. A very sinister, corrupt city if there ever was one, especially in the movie business, and/or the life of 'The Idle Rich'.<br /><br />Jake then is plunged in to a world of hapless terror while he witnesses a murder, but is 'paralized', and can't 'act' to save the victim. He tries, lord knows he tries!<br /><br />A brief appearance by the great Guy Boyd as a very 'noirish', been-there-seen-that-world-weary-wise-guy detective, who really drills (again, no pun intended) Scully like the victim got drilled to death.<br /><br />Cut to Jake in a spinning bed, watching late night porno ads, and a very particular one catches his eye, \\"Holly Does Hollywood\\". He calls, gets an audition for the next \\"Holly\\" flick, reads for the director, gets the job.?.?. What is Jake so suddenly obsessed with now? WHO is Jake suddenly obsessed with now? Porno actress Holly Body (played by Melanie Griffith in her BEST role EVER), a naive (?), blue-eyed, bleach blonde, brain dead bimbo (?); or is she a very intelligent, extremely beautiful, rough and tough (?) femme fatale that Jake shouldn't be getting involved with???!<br /><br />One of Craig's best scenes as Jake are during this period, especially in the porn flick, when he walks into the bathroom, saying \\"Ok\\" with such a stilted slur, JUST like real porno...VERY BAD dialogue! Or, dialogue done VERY BADLY!<br /><br />Frankie Goes To Hollywood deliver a tour-de-force performance in this crucial point of the film (as great as The Yardbirds in Antonioni's \\"Blow Up\\"!) remaining as fresh today as it did then.<br /><br />Eventually the mystery is solved, super dog kills the bad man, and we have The End! But, not so easy as all that. This is a very deep, disturbing, hypnotic, visceral, cerebral look inside the Human mind, and the wicked world of Hollywood. The sleazy-ness of it all. And, the blood and gore behind the scenes. And, Jake must learn to (literally) 'act'.<br /><br />The way De Palma catches 'claustrophobia' visually is utterly breathtaking, and SO realistic. The journey into Jake's mind is a cinema sweep of pure genius! And, all over a body double.<br /><br />This is a film that will play you like a fool, but treat like its best friend at the same time. De Palma, of coarse, had to take on the MPAA in defense of the rating of this film. Plus, he originally wanted to cast a real life porno actress as Holly Body, but the studios shot him down on that one, but in his favor really, because this was the role Melanie Griffith was born to play! He first fought them over ratings in 80 over \\"Dressed To Kill\\", then in 83 over \\"Scarface\\", winning all three times. This is also the film which helped concrete him as 'mysoginistic', something he got labeled by extremist women's groups when he made \\"Dressed To Kill\\" (something that baffles me even to this day, because here were all these sleazy lowrate B-grade horror films that De Palma was mocking with the book-ends of this film, nude females running around like brain dead bimbo's, but everybody loved those, but De Palma films a woman nude with style and class, or a woman murdered -count ONE woman- and he gets attacked for being too violent toward women in his films.?.?.?.) Do what????!<br /><br />This is a very classy, stylish, almost noirish, psychological, sinister look into the whole seedy Hollywood world, warts and all, from the glitz to the 'sl*ts'. And, he did it with guts! True masterpiece from the Master of Horror that remains as timeless as when it was released. Highly recommended!

0743270754|5.0|For such a thick book, you really can finish it off quickly. I debated whether to read a biography of Lincoln, or this one. I think what's so special about this book is that it shows so many angles to the cabinet that might be overlooked in a general Lincoln biography. Overall, the relationship between Lincoln and Seward was most interesting. Kind of makes you wonder what really is going on between Obama and Hillary Clinton in the wake of the 2008 primary. Also interesting was the extent that a young John Hay had in the Lincoln Administration.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Definitely the products you buy on Amazon are of excellent quality and the person and the shops are absolutely trustworthy.    The completely strongly recommend my purchases from Venezuela
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I had heard that a \\"revival\\" of Hawaii Five-O was coming, but didn't think it would surpass or equal the original Hawaii Five-O series.  How wrong I was!  Though I enjoyed the old series, this one is excellent!  Every episode was 100% excellent!  I love the actors in this series and the scenery - WOW!  I am ordering the Season One DVD to keep in my collection....can't wait until Season Two in September 2011.  All four actors are great! Alex, Scott, Daniel, and Grace are the greatest!!!!
1407109367|5.0|Catching Fire, the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy is excellent. Without a doubt better than the first. Like the first Collins has no problem with describing her teen-aged heroine's killing of other teenagers in graphic and gory ways but refrains from discussing sex and desire in any but the most muted and coy manner. It pisses me off that America is so damned happy to sell porno-violence to teens but sex makes them gasp in horror.<br /><br />I can't decide whether to pick up the third book this instant or read something else to build my anticipation of a third and final excellent read in the series.
B004G6009K|5.0|First - BUY the movie. You will not regret its humor, charm or beauty. I had the distinct pleasure of seeing in the theater, and honestly, the Blu-Ray version of the movie delights just the same. The color and saturation is spectacular, the score is crisp and full and importantly, the center channel is not muffled.<br /><br />Buy it - you will NOT be dissapointed.
0060853972|4.0|I throughly enjoyed this humours tale of the initiation of the apocalypse, yes, the world ending, all is lost, apocalyse - but with jazz hands! This was my first Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett book and if this book is a good representation of their story telling abilities two words come to mind - British and Funny. As a fan of British humor, which I don't think many American always get (its just so dry and subtle) I was very entertained, I didn't necessarily laugh out loud, but I did (often) chuckle in my head. The story flowed well with the anticipation of how the world would end building with each chapter. The ending was... well, it was okay. I won't say too much to reveal what happened but I was neither disatisfied or overly satisfied with it. Oh yeah, I hear that the book is in the works to be a TV miniseries ([...]) and well, that would be utterly fun. One last thing - I loved the character Crowley and wanted more of him... perhaps a prequel about his time through history or something.
B00117QA1Y|4.0|If you want to watch Supernatural then you need to buy the DVD Seasons. The reason is that the Music on the pay per ep is not the same as the orignal. Example. On the Season 1 Finale on the DVD we here a Great song from the Group Kansas. Waywod Son. On pay per ep it is some other song and not nearly as good. But. The Show Supernatural has it all. Great Family Drama and Great Music and Great Action and Fx and all kinds of Monsters and Demons and even The Devil himself. This is one Series that will make you keep a light on during the night and make you hope that that same light does not flicker. For if it does. Then you have trouble.
B003UESJHE|4.0|Great movie.  The rating is because profanity spews out in frustration.  It is a good story made better by the fact it is based on a real life.
B004L3AQFG|4.0|This movie was good for what it was it shows people should not go out on there own ridding bikes pack packing. I felt for this guy frist but he got what he ask for going out on his own.
B004TF3HZ2|5.0|This double CD live album is a MUST listen for any lover of Progressive Rock and music in general.  The compositions are flawless and the recordings impeccable.  Steve Hackett, the genius behind this music is by far the most unheralded, unrecognized musician, performer, composer and guitar player in the world  (unless of course you have been paying attention since he left Genesis).  You will NOT regret buying this CD!!! TEN STARS!

0316044695|5.0|There haven't been many firsthand accounts written about what's going on in Afghanistan (at least that I've found readily available), making this story all the more important to anyone who wants to form an opinion of the war, either one way or the other. I daresay it should be required reading, so that people who voice their opinions on war, or Afghanistan in general can at least do so with the firsthand knowledge one gains from reading this book. In addition to describing the events of operation Redwing, and the book being part autobiograhical, Luttrell pays a beautiful homage to his fallen comrades, filled with all of the emotion and pain of someone losing his closest relative.    The first half of the book is autobiographical. Luttrell talks about his life growing up, including his motivation for joining the Navy SEALs, and more interestingly (because I know little about the military) his training at BUD/s. Admittedly the tone he takes is one of arrogance, but that arrogance is put into context when he talks about his training, and the astounding dropout rate amongst potential SEAL recruits.    The story I found to be intensely human; one of survival at it's darkest (I was reading the book at work, and had to stop for fear I might start crying, opting to instead finish the book in the quiet of my own bedroom). But for all of it's sadness, the story had an ending that was uplifing, giving one a sense of hope about the future of that poor country. I felt that I was right there with the author, suffering alongside him, losing hope as he was clinging to the side of the mountain in pitch-black after his friends were killed, thinking the military thought the same of him.    And through his brash SEAL attitude, he does raise some interesting moral questions regarding ROE (rules of engagement) especially when the nature of your mission is one of stealth, and you're literally surrounded by people who would give nothing more than to see you suffer before you die.    It's abook, one of a few writen in modern times, that I think can form the basis of understanding of modern warfare. I think it's fair to say that the days of \\"good guys\\" versus \\"bad guys\\" ended long ago, thus changing the very nature of conflict in foreign lands. In short, I think this is how wars will be fought from now on. Not city, by city , or island by island, as it was in WWII, but house by house, or in some cases person by person, as it seems to be being fought in Afghanistan.
0743298039|1.0|I have never received the book that I ordered from them. I waited until after the last day they said I would receive it to contact them and they weren't much help.

B003L77G8I|5.0|[[ASIN:B003L77G8I Bones: The Complete Sixth Season]] began awkwardly; after an uncomfortable romantic rejection by Tempe (which she reversed herself on, too late), Booth surprised her by introducing a girlfriend, embarking on a hot and heavy relationship with globe-trotting journalist, Hannah Burley (Katheryn Winnick)...while this plot device was intended to create new sparks and tension between the leads (not a bad idea in a very long-running series), the chemistry between Hannah and Booth wasn't there, the sparks weren't there, and truthfully, the over-padded 7-episode story arc was one of the most disappointing of the show's history (even the murders seemed routine!) The saving grace was the often funny, occasionally tragic, and always believable subplot between Angela and Hodgins, as they impatiently waited on their baby. Kudos on timing the pregnancy out; too often, on series television (unless a star is actually 'with child'), the time between the discovery and the delivery is only the length of time between 'sweeps'...here, we watched the development, physically and emotionally, of Angela, shared their heartache over a potential genetic defect that could leave their baby blind, enjoyed Hogkins actually standing up to her rockin' daddy (ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons)...Michaela Conlin and T.J. Thyne were, to me, the saving grace of the first part of the season.<br /><br />HOWEVER, when Hannah served Booth her walking papers (refusing to marry him), \\"Bones\\" IMMEDIATELY jumped into high gear (with the exception of the 'groanable' 'crossover' episode/pilot of new series, \\"Finder\\", which shouldn't have aired, even if both series have the same producer)...The cases got far more interesting, the sexual chemistry between Booth and Brennan resumed without a hitch, a truly frightening, lethal opponent to Booth (fellow sniper Jacob Broadsky, played by the wonderfully wicked Arnold Vosloo, of the \\"Mummy\\" series), initiated one of the most shocking, unexpected plot-twists, ever, and the finale offered a 1-2 punch that caught me totally by surprise! I can't WAIT until next season, the swansong for one of my favorite TV 'families'.<br /><br />While 5-stars may seem too high for some, with the less-than-stellar start to Season Six, the series certainly earned it, with the amazing comeback it made...And now on to the Grand Finale!finale offered a 1-2 punch that caught me totally by surprise!

B004LL1HM4|5.0|I've been eagerly awaiting this release. At first this CD kind of bounced right off me. After repeated listens however this is a superb addition to the Fleet Foxes catalog. For those reviewers who have sent in two star reviews, keep listening. Heartfelt lyrics, great harmonies, atmospheric and stunning. I get hints of the Hollies, CSNY, Neil Young. Keep it up gentlemen!

B003QNXPUK|4.0|i dont know why people have such a problem with this shield. easy installation, the spray and squeegee make for an excellent installation with almost 0 bubbles. im sort of a perfectionist when it comes to this so i saw a little fiber under it so i had to take mine off. which led to a small problem. there is a little part at the bottom that has dried out adhesive and it it a little annoying but not very noticeable. one of the cons i noticed with this shield is it is not very good with cases. i tried putting my incipio case on it and the bottom of the screen protector began to peel and i had to re-apply that part. this shield creates traction. if you put this on a table and try sliding it it sticks to the table. it dosnt have a sticky feeling to it just solid. if you were to put it on a slant it probably would not slide off. the front screen protector does not offer much resistance so you can make quick movements on the phone screen. one of the only complaints i have about this shield is the ripple effect. if you have had one of these zagg shields you know what i mean. it is not a big deal but it is not as slick as the normal screen. otherwise it is a great protector. i highly recommend it to anyone.

0375836675|4.0|Ok.  LOVED The Book Thief.  Who didn't?  Don't expect that in this book, and honesty the second is never as good as the first, right?  BUT I decided today after finishing this book that although it took me a long time to enjoy, a long time to \\"get into it,\\" that it is good for several reasons.  It is the ying TBT's yang.  Both have the same literary message, but in this book it isn't as black and white - good versus evil - I mean Nazi hatred and zenophilia is an obvious evil, right?  Well, this is the gray.  It's Hannah Albreit's The Banality of Evil to Elie W's Day and Night.  The message is there - it's just you have to dig thru the text to have it spelled out on the last page.  Like TBT, it's about doing nothing to help humanity (not always in such obviously bad situations), it's about finding what others need, and providing - even if it's just ice cream.  It's about caring, stepping outside your comfort zone, helping others, challenging yourself, and perhaps finding your compassion.  The message is that we all should help others, challenging ourselves to be more than we \\"are\\" or going further than we think we can, trying to help others that we might not try to help.  It's also more about the \\"reward\\" of helping others, the paycheck within yourself and from others - and learning to say your welcome.  So, like TBT it's about finding your faith, finding yourself, but in a not so obvious way.  I didn't like it at first.  I didn't like it after 40 pages.  By page 100, I was glued.  Perhaps better to get at the library than buy.
B002W24E0G|5.0|I bought the CD having heard a couple songs on Sirius.  I figured I might like some more.  The whole CD rocks from start to finish.  Gotta see this guy when he comes to town.  Outstanding!
0425241505|3.0|I wouldn't herald this as the birth of the best new series, it was an ok book. i have read better. The concept is nice but it's so overdone and if you're goingto re-do it, doit better. it was Fair to fine with a few good scenes in between. Buy on bargain or borrow from a friend.
B00000BKI4|5.0|Heard these guys on The Mansion of Fun on Sirius.  Turned out to be as good as a \\"Best of\\" CD.  Start to finish.
B004XKMEK2|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of the ever so multi-talented Jennifer. She's had a very strong music career even though critics and haters a lot of times maligned her. Also her career has always had a great deal of sex appeal but she's always seemed to keep it so classy and fun, And i've always admired that about her. She returns this year with Love?   A Dance oreinted album full of great songs. \\"Rebirth\\" to me will always be my favorite English album of hers, but this one is also really great.    Another thing i also enjoy about this album is how consistent it is. No surprise there, all her albums have always had a strong sense of cohesion, where the songs blended and complimented eachother wonderfully. And i love Jennifer Lopez's dulcet voice. It's PERFECT for Pop Music, it has a strong urgency but yet not to overpowering. And for anyone who says Jennifer can't sing, well you're just claiming false and trite statement, because her gorgeous and majestic Spanish album \\"Como Ama Una Mujer\\" shows just how much her voice can soar, and how beautiful it really is. In fact, \\"Como Ama Una Mujer\\" is my favorite album of all time, and this is coming from someone who owns over 900 albums and whose favorite artists range from Stevie Nicks, Laura Branigan, Jewel, Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler, Fleetwood Mac, Joni Mitchel, ect...    If you're a fan of J.Lo, this album won't dissapoint, It's not her strongest but it just might be her most fun and energetic one. So if you're barely getting to know her, this album is Perfect to start her career with. Next would be her incredible album \\"J.Lo\\" and then work your way from there.    I LOVE LOVE LOVE this album!!!  It was incredibly difficult to choose favorites since all the songs are exceptional, but here they are    My Top 5  1. Until It Beats No More  2. Run The World  3. I'm Into You  4. Papi  5. Villain
B004OFWLO0|5.0|No need to review the incredible music of Robert Johnson. Along with Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and Bob Dylan he was among the most influential American artists of the 20th century--despite the fact that his entire catalog fits on two CDs.    My review focuses instead on this reissue compared to the 1990 Complete Recordings, as good as they were for their time. That version is like standing on the porch, peering through a dirty, grease-smudged window into the room where 75 years ago Robert Johnson sat in a creaky wooden chair, wailing his heart out while playing his amazing guitar with what sounds like four hands. This new set transports you into the room, sitting right next to Johnson--not just hearing the music but feeling it. There is still the crackle, hiss, and pop of these old recordings. Some future advance in processing technology might someday remove this noise while leaving all the other audio unscathed, and it's debatable whether this would be good or bad. But on these discs Robert Johnson's music comes through brighter, cleaner, fuller, and more alive than I have ever heard it.    I can't speak to whether this set simply restores something that the 1990 versions inadvertently muffled compared to even earlier versions. But I can't imagine a better set out there, and for any serious student of American music or just music period, these recordings in some form are absolutely essential. And I can't imagine being without them.
0062060554|4.0|I really enjoyed \\"Before I Go To Sleep.\\" The author did an excellent job at capturing my attention at the very beginning of the novel and holding it all the way through to its horrifying conclusion. The characters were very well developed, as was the plot. Christine, the novel's narrator, is living a truly nightmarish existence. She wakes up every morning not knowing who she is, where she is, or how she came to be there. Christine doesn't know who she can trust. And as the novel progresses, we the readers begin to realize that Christine's world is much scarier place than we could have ever imagined.     I completely lost myself in Christine's search for the truth about her past. I think you will, too.    If you're a fan of mysteries, I highly recommend you give this book a chance. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|What a way to start a series off in style. The beginning of a sequel with more action to come!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I came upon this movie by accident, actually. It turned out to be an absolute gem.<br /><br />I felt inspired by his admirable story. Well shot, portrayed, and timed. Characters and actors are superb, adding to the realism and environment of the movie.<br /><br />It also made me appreciate family and many families provide to their children. Enjoy
0312370849|2.0|I had high hopes for this book, and was sorely disappointed. Recommended to me by my best friend who has a similar taste in books, I thought I'd really enjoy it. Let's just say, I didn't. The story was not fleshed out at all, and the book tried to cover way too much content. It's too bad, I was looking forward to reading this!
B00009ZYBY|5.0|In my opinion, the movie that made Russell Crowe's career as an action/epic star.<br /><br />His acting is solid, believable, and heartfelt. The story is gripping, with the fallen leader rallying his fellow gladiators to freedom.<br /><br />Action scenes have great replay value. Sometimes I just fast forward straight to the epic battle scenes. Amazing film work!
B003UESJHE|5.0|This is a wonderful film for all thinking people.  You don't have to be British to enjoy it.  It's also a great history lesson for those unfamiliar with the true story.
630529142X|5.0|At least once or a few times in our lives we've been bullied, picked on, and had nobody believe in us.<br /><br />This is an awesome fictional story. Pure classic. Many memorable scenes. You'll will laugh your socks off during some scenes and feel compassionate during others.<br /><br />Adam Sandler was at his best during this era along with Big Daddy and Billy Madison.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Great entertainment. Not the usual spin around Robin Hood. Liked the way the plot was engineered. As usual Crowe and Scott duo makes for an excellent movie. I didn't give it 5 stars since it wasn't as good as you would expect from a Ridley Scott movie. Example - if compared to kingdom of heaven, Robin Hood lacks...well an extra star.
B0011UF79C|5.0|Brotherhood, superiority, competition, family, triumph.<br /><br />Along with a star studded cast, this film is a great recipe for a pleasant movie experience.<br /><br />I found myself touched and in tears when watching the two brothers swim and compete. I myself feel that competition, but in the end, brothers are there for each other.<br /><br />Wonderful music, themes, and plot.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|Brilliant movie. Loved it.One of Mr Eastwood's best. It is not a typical Hollywood production but rather feels more like a European art movie. Although Mr Eastwood is more known for his action orientated movies (which I adore also) this movie just shows how versatile and talented he is. Didn't give it 5 stars as it wasn't as good as Gran Torrino, Million dollar baby or Unforgiven. (but came close to them)
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Captivating storytelling. Excellent performances from Jennifer connelly and russell crowe.<br /><br />-The struggles, problems, and obstacles are made absolute clear. I felt like I could relate with him on certain aspects. I felt compelled to utilize my skills and talents to my fullest ability<br /><br />- Not everyone will be a nobel prize winner, but everyone can have a beautiful mind.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|i tried to connect my iphone 3gs to the tv, there's only audio coming out of the tv, no video. very disappointed.
0803729227|5.0|This book has become a fast favorite in our household since our son received it as a Christmas gift.  The story is very original, and the illustrations are fun to look at too.  The way it is written makes it fun to read.  Always sorry to get to the end of it!
0307887960|5.0|Diet diary,  I am a 50 year old woman, 5 foot 3.5 inches, at 163#, with a very small body frame, who pretty much has given up on dieting.  I've tried everything from portion control and sensible eating to the extreme HCG diet with injections and 650 calorie a day restrictions with no help.  The diets stop me from gaining weight, but I never get ahead of it and it is just not worth it.  I have gained 5# a year for the last 6 years and can see myself at 200# in as many years.   I was drinking several Pepsi's a day, craving candy, chips, crackers, carbs, coming home from work ravenously hungry and grouchy with my family that no one thinks to start dinner.  I have lots of bloating, gastrointestinal distress, always hungry and never have much energy to do anything.  I heard about this Dukan diet and it sounded just different enough and with the probationary time of diet leading to eating normally with the one day of protein a week sounded like it would be worth a try, though I had read one reader's review that with the age that I am, being in the onset of menopause, not to be surprised if it doesn't work.  The change of hormone ratio in a pre-menopausal woman, makes it very difficult to lose weight.  I figured I'd know within 2 weeks if this was going to do anything for me and I could suffer anything for a couple of weeks, but surprisingly, I am not suffering and I feel better than I did when I was eating anything I could lay my hands on, so here goes with a day to day of my first 2 weeks:    Started Wednesday, April 20, night meal, making it easier to diet the first day.  Cooked up eggs, and chicken that night so that I'd have food handy in the fridge.  Bought a ham and kipper snacks, fat free cottage cheese, fat free cream cheese, and oat bran.  Relatively inexpensive and not complicated shopping list.  Have beef, pork, and wild game in my freezer.   Chicken and boiled eggs for dinner, kipper snack  before I went to bed.    Thursday-Was nauseated, struggled in the afternoon with cravings for chips, candy, soda pop, etc.  Came home from work Not Grouchy and Not Starving-Amazing.  Quickly cooked myself some meat and ate it, then enjoyed cooking tacos for my family and did not cheat.  Would have tasted good, but I was not hungry and I did not feel deprived.  Nice.  Made my first oat bran pancake today.  1 egg, 1.5 Tbs oat bran, 2 Tbs of cottage cheese.  Fried one big one but it broke up when I turned it, so I'll make small ones next time.  Boiled eggs and steamed chicken for breakfast and lunch.  Had a kipper snack right when I got home to stave off grouchies while I cooked dinner which was beef roast, cut up, fat cut off, and just sort of steamed in a little bit of water with pepper, salt, garlic and parsley for flavor.  Cooked the rest of the roast in the oven for tomorrow.  I did get the expected headache from the caffeine withdrawal, knew it was going to happen though, so just rode it out.  Drinking lots of water.    Friday-Some gastrointestinal distress.  Nausea from the vitamins I took this morning.  Light headed and weak in the afternoon, just under 48 hours on the diet.  Again, came home not starving, but quickly cooked for myself and then for my family and so I was not hungry.   I added ham chunks to my oat bran pancakes and it was fun.  I made them silver dollar sized so they were like chips or snacks and they turned easily without oil in the pan because they were small.  They are more like omelets than cakes, but it gets the oat bran down w/o choking.    When it comes to about 2 hours after dinner, I seem to be restless/hungry and it is time for my oat bran cakes.  Sliced cold roast, Kipper snack, boiled eggs, fat free cottage cheese for meals during the day.  Dry fried the ham trimmed of rind and any fat and spread fat free cream cheese on the slices, for dinner.      Saturday-Not too bad so far and no dizziness or weakness today.  Taking stairs slower, but not muscle fatigued, took a potassium supplement.  I recalled from a previous high protein low carbohydrate diet, that I will have muscle cramps and muscle fatigue w/o a potassium supplement.   You might also have this trouble.  Just take one a day and it will go away.   Not craving the sweets or carbs, amazingly fast, adjusted so quickly.  The best part is no hunger pain, no cravings, no feeling deprived.  I am impressed.  I have energy.  I am not bloated.  Still having a little bit of gastrointestinal distress.  Don't take the vitamins first thing in the morning.  Too hard on your tummy.  Fried ham, roast, chicken, and eggs throughout the day, eating when I am hungry.  Venison for dinner, cut any fat off, medium rare, delicious.   I put the kid's Easter baskets together today and I felt no desire to cheat and eat their chocolates, and no one was around to stop me from cheating, it was all me.    Sunday-Woke up energetic this morning, snowing outside.  What an Easter.    Dry-fried ham and warm egg yolks for breakfast.  Chicken and roast beef for lunch.  Dinner was more Venison.  Tried fat free yoghurt instead of the cottage cheese in my oat bran and egg mixture for the evening snack, did not like it as well as the cottage cheese.  Will stick with the first recipe.  At about 8:00 at night my body starts looking for that oat bran treat.  That is the only real crave for the day if I eat before I get hungry.    Monday-Vegetables today!  Yeah!  I even steamed them last night and did not snitch, though technically I could have, it being the start of my 5th day.  I went an extra day because I was feeling so well on the protein only I did not want to mess with things, but I figured I probably need the roughage so I started today.  Dry fried ham and egg yolk for breakfast.  No fatigue today or muscle cramps.  Venison with a serving of steamed zucchini and cauliflower for lunch.  Oh, last night, when I turned over to my side and snuggled my back side in to my husband and he put his arm around me to rest his hand on my tummy, we both noticed that there was not as much tummy plopping over to lay on the bed!  No scale to measure with, but less in his hands is so much better than numbers, I'll love it if I can gage this weight loss by the fit of my jeans, less muffin top to no muffin top to smaller pant size, rather than just the water weight loss numbers on the scale, that I've seen before and watched come right back...    Getting really tired of water, I've been tanking extra so that I would not hurt my kidneys, I am sick of it today.   Maybe I can add a little bit of lemon to my water, use a straw, etc., to change the delivery at least, that might help.   Much Later:  Ok, this was a miserable day.  I added the cauliflower and zucchini for lunch and I had mega cravings all afternoon.  Miserable.  I'll be glad for tomorrow, back on the all protein day.  My body remembered what it wanted and it bugged me all day for it.  Kipper snack for afternoon snack.  Cold roast spread with fat free cream cheese for dinner and 1/4 of a tomato, tasted yummy, but all that Easter candy hanging around and half of an Easter cake were really bugging me tonight, so I had the kids clear all temptation out, which has not been a problem until I added those vegetables today.   Back to my 1 egg, 2 Tbs oat bran, 2 Tbs cottage cheese cake tonight, much better than the yoghurt recipe.  As far as the exercising,  I am doing 10-30 minutes of stretching, windmills, and leg lifts in the mornings depending on my energy and strength, and in the evenings I am riding my stationary bike 20-40 minutes while I watch the nightly news when I have time and when I remember, just about every other day.  I do not have any tension on the gears so as not to build muscle, I just want to get the circulation going.  I can feel my heart beat in my extremities when I am finished for a good 20 minutes afterwards, so I know the blood is circulating.  If I start get short of breath and feel my heart working too hard, I switch exercises to a stretch and then switch back to finish my reps when it is gone.  I notice that I can do more reps the next time w/o raising my heart rate too much this way.  I have much more stamina since I have been exercising in this manner and it keeps the cortisol (stress hormone) released in my system to a minimum.       Tuesday-April 26, 2011-Muffin top not as pronounced this morning, pants not so painfully tight.  Did not unzip them in the car the minute I got off of work.  Did not run down stairs to put on my comfy sweats either the minute I got home.  Gives me hope.  My face looks slimmer to me.  I've not told anyone about the diet, don't want to draw attention, especially if I fail.  Fried ham and egg yolk for breakfast, getting sick of egg whites.  Water tastes good again today, got a straw, I know it sounds silly, but it worked.  Venison and Chicken for lunch.  No cravings today, thank heavens!  I got out a roast and some chicken out of the freezer this morning to defrost so I can cook tonight again.  Need to make sure I have lots of prepared food on hand.  This helps in the morning when I leave for work, and am in a rush, the food is cooked and ready to go w/o making me late to prepare something special, and when I get home from work, if I am hungry I don't have to wait long to eat.   Came home really late tonight and had visions of food from every restaurant we passed by, but by the time I got my oat cakes made and eaten I was craving-free again.  They must be pretty important.  Parboiled chicken and boiled eggs for dinner.    Wednesday-April 27-Day 7 starting into Day 8.  It has been a pretty painless week all considered and there is noticeable difference in the fit of my pants already, not so painfully tight that I need to pop the button to sit down at my desk.  Muffin top is noticeably less, pants pull up further in the back too.  Nice. Still not pretty, but nice progress.  Ate cold boiled eggs on the run for breakfast.  Dry-fried some slices of roast last night and cut them up into bite sized pieces and had them ready for me to grab on my way out the door, for lunch, along with a nice tomato that I ate like an apple, a bite every now and then, throughout the afternoon.   Not too bad, but sure could use a nice cold, bubbly, sugary, Pepsi... on ice or out of the can, I would not be too picky today, but I promise myself I won't cave.  I don't do Aspartame, (makes me sick) so the Diet Pepsi Dukan says I can have is out...  Too bad.  I might convert to diet if the stuff did not make me sick.  Probably better for me to stay away from anyway.  Ok, miracle.  I had somewhere to go tonight so I came home from work and cooked my oat cake and ate it on the way.  On our way home, the kids were hungry and so we stopped at a burger place and I just knew I'd cave.  We got in, they all ordered their burgers and fries and I just did not.  Honestly, the only thing I could have really swam in was the fry sauce!  I did not though.  I was amazed and I was not in pain or feel deprived.  I just was not hungry so I was good.  This is the diet to kick all diets.    Thursday-I blew it today.  Got off of work and had to run in the grocery store with my teenager.  She grabbed a box of cookies from the bakery and before I knew what I was doing, that cookie was gone!  I ate it and then another one!  Then I got queasy and kind of light headed.   Went home, ate my cold roast, lay down a little while till the dizziness (probably from the sugar) was gone, and felt sorry for myself until I decided not to kick myself too hard, just to keep going on the diet. Ate boiled eggs for breakfast, chicken for lunch.  Good day other than lesson learned, do not go in to the grocery store with teenager, before eating dinner.  Stay in the car.  Funny contrast between yesterday and today... food for thought...      Friday-April 29-Day 10-Washed my jeans last night.  Put them on this morning fresh out of the dryer and yes, the muffin top is almost gone!  I could probably stuff myself into asmaller size, but I am kind of enjoying the painless jeans for a minute.  Not needing to pop the top button or unzip them to get comfortable, is a good feeling.  Egg yolk and fried slices of roast for breakfast, chicken for lunch.  Eating less often and eating less at a time.  I think that my body is adjusting and is satiated, and I am less frantic about making sure I get enough to eat so that I won't be hungry...  all in the mental process of dieting, fearing being hungry or not getting enough.  All food for thought...  Sea food buffet for dinner, stuffed myself and had a tummy ache, but it was yummy shrimp, crab, and fish.    Saturday-April 30-Day 11-Ham and eggs for breakfast.  Oat cake in the afternoon.  Went to son's house for dinner, BBQ'd beef, sautéed onions and mushrooms, zucchini.  He also BBQ'd sliced pineapple and I caved again and had some...  Ate too much again, went to bed with  a stomach ache for the 2nd night in a row due to over eating.  Still feeling the pounds shed off.  Wish I had scales to see what the numbers really are.  Pants sure fit nice though.    Sunday-May 1st-Day 12-Roast and scrambled eggs for breakfast.  Pork for dinner.  Oat cakes.  Exercised this morning and rode bike tonight.  Got to say it is getting harder, but I think the reason it is harder is that I keep cheating.  If I'd stay off of the sugar completely I think I would not be having these doubts and cravings.  When I am good, I have no problem.  When I cave, I pay for it the next couple of days while I get it out of my system.  I think that is the reason for complete compliance, is that it makes it easier to stay on the diet, less painful, less cravings, more doable to shut the sugar out completely, rather than try and use self control and only have a little.  My body likes it and it wants it when reminded of what it is missing.   Put my dress on to go to church and could not believe the difference.  The sleeves of the dress are not sucked up tight like they have been, thebodice is looser, I could tie the tie in the back w/o my tummy looking 6 months pregnant.  The tummy is flatter in the dress, much more attractive.  I may even dig deeper in my closet and find a smaller dress for next week, just to see...      Monday-May 2nd-Day 13-Wore a shirt today that I could not have worn last week due to the buttons gaping and the form/shadow of the muffin top poking out over my jeans.  I wear larger, thick fabric tops with jackets to layer the look and hide the fat rolls.  I never wear knit tops.  Too much pride I guess, but I don't want anyone to see what I look like under my \\"layers\\".  Because I dress to camouflage, no one has noticed that I have lost any weight except for my husband and he has definitely noticed.   I am glad that fat can be camouflaged, but it will be so nice when  I can wear one shirt at a time or even a knit top again.  Yes it will be nice.  Pork, beef, and chicken cubed in a bowl to eat today.   It is easier on me to not get too hungry, I am lucky enough that I can keep it at my desk at work and eat a bite here and there instead of having to wait for my lunch break and wolf a bunch down to hold me over.   Still drinking lots of water.  Helps take the worry away about the possibility of kidney problems, though now that I am not drinking soda, my kidneys don't cramp up like they used to, so that is a good sign.  Don't know if I'll come out of this with the resolve to never drink soda again, I do love it... we will have to see how much I want to feel good and stay thin when all is said and done...    Poached salmon for dinner.    Tuesday-May 3rd-Day 14-I made it!  I can't believe it was 2 weeks ago that I said I'd try this for 2 weeks and that I'd know if it was going to do anything and here I am, 2 weeks later and it is going to work!  I am now officially excited, couldn't really get excited before because I did not want to be sad if it did not work.  The drill is simple, no fuss.  Make sure you always have plenty of meat/fish/eggs already cooked so you won't get hungry and blow it.  But if you do blow it, don't get too upset, just start over and keep going.  Try not to cheat because it makes it harder to stay faithful for the next couple of days, but if you do, realize the cravings will go away again in a couple of days and that you can still do it.   Don't listen to the reviews that say this is a boring diet or a dangerous diet.  They have not tried it.  This works.  You've got nothing to lose but weight.  Give it  a try.  You now know what to expect for the first 2 weeks.  I am thinking that the next weeks ahead will be the same.  I'll really have to not cheat if I want to enjoy life w/o cravings.  I am wanting to cry with joy at the thought that I have found something that will work for me.  I am 50 years old, not old enough to want to stop enjoying looking good in a nice pair of jeans and dancing the night away with my man.  I'll write an addendum in a couple of months to let you know how it is going.   Good luck.    Update May 20, 2011  I stayed on the diet for 4 weeks.  I lost an amazing amount of weight for me.  I was not being faithful enough to not have the cravings and so I was getting grouchy with my family...  I looked into fat free dressings, etc., and went on a more normal diet w/o no or low sugar and one serving of carb with the dinner meal.  No bread yet, but I do tortillas some nights, brown rice, sometimes pasta, and potatoes.  You cannot eat bread and expect to lose weight.  2 pieces of bread a day will maintain your weight, more than that and you will gain.  Lots and lots of vegetables and meat all through the day so my body thinks that it is a time of feast instead of famine.  No skipping meals. I am not drinking Pepsi at all, and with no cravings.  The diet jump started my system into using fat for energy instead of sugar, cleared my system of all the sugar I had been living on, and I am still losing weight with an amazing speed. I am so excited, grateful, almost in tears over the change in my body.  It is starting to look more like me each day.   When I quit the diet, I figured that I would start it again in a month, but I have not had to, as I am still losing weight.  The diet just gave me some common sense, shocked my system out of the rut I was in.  Do it.  You won't regret it.   I have been able to slowly increase the time I spend stretching in the morning and the amount of repetitions of the windmills and leg lifts and time I spend stretching.  My physical strength is increasing, and my stamina.  Still too muddy to walk, but the stationary bike works.  I have no desire to build bulk, I am stretching to make a long lean torso and working the thighs and but areas to get rid of the fat.  The fat is coming off all of me, evenly, but since the butt and legs are bigger I am targeting them.  The belly fat insulin ring melted away once I got off of the sugar.  You don't have to suffer with the exercising, just start slow and build up as you can.  No reason to hurt and be washed out for the day.  Good luck.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I should state up front that this book is excellent and not geared towards the information technology profession directly.  However, I feel it is important to tackle this review from an Information Technologist's perspective, as I believe there is a growing epidemic that faces the IT profession.  This book made a difference for me:    As an Information Technology professional, I have watched in disbelief as many of my colleagues and co-workers have been overcome by job burnout.  The unsettling thing is that these are promising and intelligent individuals that have been forced into capitulation by the ever-growing pressures of the Information Technology role in the enterprise.  Why?  Why is it that the once most passionate and promising upstarts not only leave the company, but leave the field entirely!  The curiosity that ensued has taken my journey towards finding ways to increase job satisfaction within the information technology profession.  I am a doctoral student that has explored flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting and work/life balance through the very real topic of workplace bullying or mobbing.  The concepts of positive psychology are more than simply a half-full versus a half-empty proposition.  Shawn Achor absolutely nails it in this book, and presents the information in an entertaining and informative manner.    I applied Shawn Achor's perspectives and have discovered that success does truly revolve around happiness, and not the other way around.  From the information technology perspective, the most influential principles that resonated to me were principle #5 (the Zorro Circle) and principle #3 (the Tetris Effect).  However, application of each of the principles can be made towards one's outlook and perspective.  For those practitioners that are pressured with long, impossible hours and neglect the social circle that surrounds you, please read principle #7 (Social Investment).  The parable that Shawn explains with volunteer firefighting issuccinct and memorable.    You owe it to yourself to take a weekend and just read it.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|I can't see how people can write reviews based on listening to samples......the whole album should be listened to before writing a review. there's many times that I wasn't impressed with samples, but when hearing the full songs ending loving them. Anyway this is really a great album. Anabel Lee is a song that sounds like one of those timeless Fleetwood Mac songs from years ago. Moonlight, Secret Love, Wide Sargasso Sea are favorites. The bonus track from Barnes & Noble, My Heart, is a real treat too! If you like Stevie, you can't go wrong with this set.

0312370849|5.0|I could not put it down. Excellent story of a Jewish family in France and how they were treated during the war.
0307277453|5.0|This is a science-based book written for people not deeply familiar with biology.  Unlike a lot of science books, it's easy to read and has easily grasped explanations.  I really liked that, even though it's a book about evolution, it doesn't argue against any specific religion, like a lot of books do: it simply explains the evidence and doesn't throw it in your face. It explains some of the mysteries of life, such as why we get dizzy when we get drunk and why men are more prone to get hernias, among many others.  All in all, a very fun read.
B0020BUWX2|1.0|This could have been a beautiful book, but I found the language offensive.  The \\"F\\" word was used so many times, I was beginning to wonder if this was the only word the writer could think of to express feelings, and situations in the book.  The English language is beautiful, and there are many many words to express thoughts and ideas without reverting to profanity.
B002NWRMVS|4.0|Nora Jones is always exciting as no two albums to date can be classified in the same vein. Obviously any artist has a certain style but Nora seems to be able to variate her music to maintain ones interest. I like her dogs too!!
B004I1AGTM|5.0|If you enjoyed Ip Man, you will love this chapter in the Saga.  Whether you choose to watch with subtitles or view with English SAP, the action is fantastic.  Some of the old fashion wire and spring board techniques are used to enhance the action but don't take away from the movie.  Samo Hung puts in a rare and great appearance. You will remember him from TV's Martial Law.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|One of the few soundtracks that the prominent songs in the movie are actually on the soundtrack!  Particularly liked the remake of \\"White Rabbit\\", the artist makes the song their own, but still pays appropriate homage to the original.  This was a present for my husband, and he plays it all the time!!
B004FOA84A|4.0|sorta a mini 7th guest game good when waiting in line or on the can.   strange that we have to put twenty word to give good feedback
0345522478|5.0|I have to admit that I am an overly serious person, reading most about the Holocust and the Gulaug.<br /><br />But when I got a hold of Kevin Hearne's first part triology, boy was I in for a fun ride!<br /><br />The pace was exciting, the story was intriguing, and the hero and dog were hilarious!<br /><br />I can't remember a book as seriously funny as this one.<br /><br />I can't wait for June and July to bring the Hexed and Hammered to by reading space.<br /><br />You can't lose on taking this novel to heart.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|Just stay away.  The movie is really bad.  I'm not sure what else to say, the plot sucks, the acting is bad, there is no redeeming quality to this movie.
B003UESJH4|5.0|A great movie. My wife originally made me buy it and after viewing I must agree with her. This is a keeper.
