B0015DROBO|4.0|This book took a bit for me to get into, but once I got past the beginning it really picked up the pace and turned into an awesome read. So many times I found myself saying....\\"I didn't see that coming\\". Loved the book overall. (Already read book 2, even better) Very worth reading.
B000B8657S|5.0|In 1987, Hyperion Records began what turned out to be a colossal project: the recording of all of Franz Schubert's songs (or lieder), a total of 729 songs performed by over 60 soloists. Some of these songs are for male voice, others for female voice, and others for several singers together. (In comparison, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's landmark recording of all the lieder for solo male voice includes 463 songs on 21 CDs; now available at a bargain price.) Originally released on 37 CDs, over a period of 18 years (the amount of time it took Schubert to compose all these songs, before his early death), this new set presents the songs in chronological order. It is hard to understate the monumental scope of this set. Never before have all of these songs been available together, and never before have listeners been able to appreciate the broad scope of Schubert's compositions.<br /><br />Beginning with an idea by accompanist Graham Johnson, and continued as a labor of love (and a relative commercial success), Hyperion Records managed to bring together many of the great lieder singers of the time, even providing showcases for young singers who would go on to become essential performers in this genre. From \\"classic\\" singers such as Ann Murray, Janet Baker and Peter Schreier, to new finds like Ian Bostridge and Matthias Goerne, this set is full of great voices. Even the grandfather of Schubert lieder, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, makes a cameo appearance, reading some poems that are part of the cycle Die Schöne Müllerin, by Wilhelm Müller, which Schubert did not set to music.<br /><br />Added to this set (and released separately in 2006) are three discs of songs by Schubert's friends and contemporaries, including Beethoven, Haydn, Mendelssohn, and others, giving the listener an overview of the type of lieder that influenced him. But it is the 37 discs of Schubert's songs that are important here; the \\"extras\\" are just that, like special features on a DVD.<br /><br />Listening tothis set in chronological order is enlightening, as one can grasp the evolution in the subtlety and depth of Schubert's compositions. Starting with his earliest songs, written in his teens, and progressing through his final year, as he was 31, the journey is long, yet rewarding. Schubert's music is the most accomplished of the genre, and the excellent choice of soloists - along with the brilliant accompaniment by Graham Johnson - imbues a great deal of variety and a rich palette of vocal colors. Unlike the Fischer-Dieskau set (which, I must confess, is one of my absolute favorite sets of classical music), where one listens to the range and expanse of a single, masterful voice, the Hyperion set gives the listener a chance to discover the music in more variety. For those who do not like Fischer-Dieskau, this set can be an eye-opener. However, it will never, for me, replace the Fischer-Dieskau set...<br /><br />While I do not like all the singers on this set, most of them are excellent. Many of the singers lack the immersion that Fischer-Dieskau had in this music, but others are revelations. The recordings by Brigitte Faessbender are excellent, as are those by Stephen Varcoe, a singer I was not familiar with before. Thomas Hampson's recordings here show him in his youth, and many of the other male singers - such as Philip Langridge, John Mark Ainsley and Anthony Rolfe Johnson - rise to the occasion, providing many delightful performances. (You'll notice my preference for male voices for this music, but this does not mean that there are not many excellent female voices in this set; Edith Mathis' performance of An die Musik is one of the highlights of the set, and Arleen Auger is excellent.)<br /><br />One of the revelations in this set, for me, is the many songs for several singers, including those with chorus. These songs are a little-known and rarely recorded facet of Schubert's work, and this set allows listeners to discover just how many such songs there are, and the general tone of joviality they express.<br /><br />In addition to the 40 CDs in this set, Hyperion includes a book (258,096 words, as Hyperion specifies on the box) containing an introduction by Graham Johnson and the complete texts of all the songs. While this is laudable, there are a few negatives to this book. The type is relatively small (fine for teenaged eyes, perhaps, but that is clearly not the target audience for this set), and the English translations of the songs, in a column next to the German originals, are in italics, making them even harder to read. (For a different take, and easier readability, John Reed's Schubert Song Companion is a good investment.) Broken down by year, with an introduction for each year talking about Schubert's activities, the texts appear chronologically, as they do on the discs. The back of the book contains an index by title and by poet, composer or translator, but, alas, not by singer.<br /><br />Purchasers of the original CDs in this series will be familiar with the copious notes by Graham Johnson that accompanies these discs; unfortunately, these notes are not included in the set, and are scheduled to be released in book form in the near future. (Yale University Press may be publishing several books containing these notes at some point, and, hopefully, will not charge their usual \\"scholarly\\" price, so music lovers will be able to acquire these notes.)<br /><br />All in all, this set is essential for any serious fan of Schubert's lieder, or lieder in general. While it is not cheap, the per-disc price is relatively low; congratulations are in order to Hyperion for having released the set at such an affordable price. While other recordings of Schubert's lieder will be made, this set will clearly remain the benchmark for his music; with the exception, of course, of the Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau recordings. To be honest, no serious fan of Schubert's lieder should be without either of these sets.
B007TMON8M|5.0|This is a great puzzle game with a simple and smooth interface. The puzzles are challenging and make you think. Definitely worth 99&cent;. Wish I knew about it earlier!
B0071BY1ZQ|5.0|I own all of Brad Mehldau's recordings - at least those as a leader or soloist. I'm not a big fan of jazz, but I like piano jazz, and something about Mehldau's style has always pleased me since I first heard one of his recordings some ten years ago.<br /><br />His studio recordings are a mixed bag, with those that are not trios often disappointing me. Highway Rider has some nice tunes, but I'm not inspired to play it often; and the two recordings with Pat Metheny don't work for me either. The two song discs he did with Renée Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter are also not very inspiring.<br /><br />But put him in a studio with two trusted musicians on drum and bass, and magic can happen. This disc, which is a series of odes to different people, all originals, the first such studio album since Day Is Done in 2005. I have nothing against Brad's covers; he takes standards and pop songs and interprets them in a delightful manner. But this record shows he is inspired, that he has a lot to say when he creates his own music. It's lively, enjoyable, and the interplay among the musicians is nearly perfect. All of the tracks are fairly long, most being 7-9 minutes, yet without any fat at all.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to hearing some of these works on future live recordings. In the meantime, I've been listening to this disc over and over, and it is certainly one of his best studio releases.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Purchased this through PRIME streaming video and paid extra for \\"HD\\"....... The quality was not HD quality and I stream wired so there was no excuse... Won't make that HD mistake again. I would stream in standard definition....
B000KWZ7VU|5.0|Watching this set of DVDs and listening to his magnificent performances shows why Barenboim is clearly the pre-eminent performer of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas. While many will disagree - after all, there are countless recordings by dozens of performers - what comes through after seeing these recitals is the deep familiarity that Barenboim has with the music. Playing these sonatas for some fifty years, they have become a part of him, and this shows in the way he performs these works with such conviction. (And without scores, which, alas, too many performers depend on.)<br /><br />This set contains films of a series of eight recitals that Barenboim performed in Berlin in 2005, comprising all 32 of the sonatas. Each recital lasts from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half, and contains four sonatas, a mixture of early, middle and late works. The programs themselves work well, but any selection of sonatas played by Barenboim would be fine. The camera work is among the best I've seen for this type of performance; there are enough different camera angles to keep it from being repetitive, and the intensity of watching Barenboim perform is enough to trump the limits of filming. The sound is in PCM stereo or Dolby Digital 5.1; the surround mix is excellent.<br /><br />Barenboim has already recorded the complete Beethoven sonatas twice: once for EMI when he was in his late twenties, and a second time for DG in the 1980s. One could say that these live recitals are closer to the second recording; slow tempi, much rubato, a great intensity and an often meditative approach to the music. Barenboim shines in the late sonatas, and at the end of the op. 111 sonata (no. 32), his intensity is such that he has to wipe tears from his eyes. But the early Haydnesque/Mozartian sonatas are also wonderful, with a full range of youthful passion.<br /><br />In addition to the eight recitals, this set contains two DVDs of master classes, where Barenboim shares his knowledge and experience with six young pianists. While much of the discussion is quite technical, even non-musicians will find some of the comments illuminating, providing insights into music in general and these sonatas in particular.<br /><br />This set is perhaps my best musical purchase in years. I plan to watch these recitals many times, and have gotten many insights into the music - some of the best for piano - simply by watching it performed.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|If you like a good mystery, this book is for you.  It holds your interest from start to finish, I had a hard time putting it down
B0075LTOR2|5.0|I'll tip my hat to the (as of today) two other 5-star reviewers, and add that I, too, find the sound of these remasters to be impeccable. I have long appreciated Roxy Music's first few albums, that I listened to back in the day, and I don't know the later albums very much. But this set is an opportunity to immerse myself in this wonderful music.<br /><br />Just listen to the pristine sound of If There Is Something on the first album and you can tell that these remasters hit the bulls eye.<br /><br />Now, perhaps, they can release another box set with their live recordings...

0061433047|5.0|I love pterry's writing, and this one did not disappoint.<br /><br />Tiffany Aching, a 15-year-old witch, is confronted with a Serious Evil partly because she rose to its attention by doing what she did previously. \\"No good deed goes unpunished\\", as they say.<br /><br />It's probably not a spoiler to say that all turns out OK. The Pictsies are a hoot as always.<br /><br />But- this is a more serious book than the previous Aching novels, and it takes on some serious issues.<br /><br />I know Pratchett's books have tended to the silly- albeit with increasingly thoughtful subtexts; this one fits into that trend.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game, I just don't nescessarily how much the games cost to unlock but overall its fun to play
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I was very happy with my purchase of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, the complete series including the movies. This show was great but I didn't watch it while it was on. I saw the first season as a prime member and loved it so much I bought the whole series, & was really glad that the movies were included. Any fans of good Tv or of this show would love this collection. :)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I read this book in a couple days while on vacation.  I had all sorts of theories going through my head but I didn't suspect the twist at the end.  It was a really great, fun book to read.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an action-packed, sci-fi thriller.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|The movie was interesting and the story was very good.  We did receive the DVD on the release day which was nice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book - Netflix DVD tomorrow to see how close it follows the book.  It is depressing to see how an oppressive government can manipulate our lives (too close to real world under current administration and should have been replaced last election).  The movie follows the book fairly closely, and movie #2 due out later this year.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|So, I just think these are the worst books, can you say redundant scenes!?? I am able to scroll through multiple pages and it doesn't get anyway, it is the same ole same ole, unrealistic sex scenes. I hate all the characters. Not very good writing. I just don't get it, I don't get how so many women like this trash!! I read a lot so maybe that is why. My friends kept giving me crap for not reading the 3rd book and so I got it just to try and finish the series, I can say it is the worst one by far and I am so sick and tired of the same old sex scenes. It is not even hot to me. Anyways, you should have to be 18 or older to read these too, it is not any different than Penthouse, just longer and the same kind of story line you would find in a bad porno.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great app with fantastic touch screen control.  Highly addictive and offers a great challenge at later levels.  Very easy to pick up and learn.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|To be honest, I don't know if Amazon & Adobe are on speaking terms as either companies or technologies. I downloaded Adobe Reader for Kindle expecting to be able to open pdfs from websites. As best I can determine, Adobe does a background download to the non-existent Downloads folder. No error messages, no pdf's. There's probably a hack that makes it work, but you'd have to search it out on your own cuz Adobe Help is no help. Personally, I'll be looking for a third party pdf downloader/reader.
B007SGM084|1.0|I believe that the repetiveness was done as fillers for the book. All three books could have been combined into one. The one book could  have been condensed into 100 pages or less. I wish I had read the review before purchasing all three. What a mistake. Never again will I buy a trilogy all in one shot. I am very disappointed with this book.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Although the books suck you in because of the unusual sexual content, the writing is juvenile and repetitive.  Book one was interesting because it seemed to be a novel idea, although the characters are straight out of a teenager's dream.  Book two is tiresome but kept me interested enough to finish.  I tried book three, but it has sunk into a cliche of \\"oh my's\\" and \\"glaring eyes\\".  Except for the unusual take on erotica the story is just too melodramatic and ridiculously filled with perfect bodies, extremely sensational sex and repetitive dialogue.  I wouldn't bother getting started, there are much better reads out there.
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|I have now read 3 books by this author and although her first novel wasn't quite as tense as the final ones I found myself unable to put them down - and I am not a murder mystery thriller style of reader.  Ms Flynn develops an exquisite tension in her books without making me as the reader feel frightened - a rare feat - 'Girl Gone' is a masterpiece - I want more of her please  - Boodgie
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is exactly the kind of puzzle game I love. Great interface and nice looking levels. All around a good game.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Good book and good read...to bad it totally outs a ton of information that the public should never see. DEVGRU will probably have to move the compound completely, and change a ton of tactics and possibly gear. Not to mention totally revamp their selection process. They already have hellish security regulations and not many people in the military are even \\"read-into\\" these programs, now it will be worse. I guess for the better. The parents of Bergdahl should sue this guy. He is still in enemy hands and information in this book may seriously hurt his chance of repatriation. Also, Just discussing the limitations on the overhead surveillance of the UBL compound is a major breach of national security.<br />Many civilians probably feel unsure of why certain people are upset about this book, but they should remember no matter how \\"great\\" this guy is for helping to kill UBL, there was no need to put national security and lives at risk just to set the record (the secret record) straight. While there is no doubt the skills this guy possesses are rare and his selection was hard, he is not \\"great\\" for being on this mission. Given the opportunity, there are literally millions of people that would have volunteered no matter the potential cost. What the team did was great, though he made it look like luck was what really guided mission success. I'd be surprised if guys in DEVGRU are not getting counseled to keep from killing this guy...he hurt them bad.<br />There is really no comparison between the information outed in this book and the information outed by the administration and the DoD. There is no doubt the author has b&lls, but the real shame will be if he is not prosecuted for information released in this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this book at first. Wasn't sure it sounded like something I would like. The book is well worth the money!!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked all three book alot.  But I thought it was kind of a boring ending.  And I still don't understand the whole killing of the president thing. I am waiting for the movie.  Maybe it will clear it up.  Who knows!

B000UWWLGE|5.0|Short, melodic, intricate, enjoyable jazz. The arrangements for the nonet make for probably my favorite listening experience out of all of Miles' larger ensamble works (even over most of the Gil Evans collaborations). A great buy, especially at the prices you can find on Amazon.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was thoroughly impressed with the level of detail and historical knowledge that Deborah Harkness put into her book. I had a hard time putting it down. I am glad I bought this book because I will want to re-read this a lot especially while waiting for book 3!!
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Harry Potter is now complete so of course when it comes to new book series & film adaptions, I was curious where I would go. The Hunger Games was one of the first series I went towards, pretty much because of the Harry Potter like hype and books were getting. After reading the first book of course i was on line to see the film.<br /><br />I have to say what impressed me the most about this film was the actors chosen to play these characters. It seems each actor was picked specifically because they could not only act the parts, but their features and their acting styles were prefect fits. Jennifer Lawrence was great as usual. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson officially broken through and will definitely have work after this franchinse. Still, it was their supporting cast that impressed me the most, especially Lenny Kravitz and Stanley Tucci. The story was very well translated to film, though it is very different from the book it was still great how the story got expanded a little to make it watchable. The only thing I didn't like and it seems to be something almost everyone has issues with. The shakey cam was just a little over done, but I understand why it was filmed the way it was.<br /><br />This was one of the best films I have seen this year and the book along side the film was definitely something I did not expect. A very dark story about survival in a very extreme future. I am hoping that the rest of the films are able to be up to par with this one...minus shakey cam of course.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I Love love love this trilogy! It was everything I heard about plus more!!!!! I encourage everyone to read these books.....even men:)
B000IKQK7E|5.0|Like in another great Donald Sutherland flick, M*A*S*H, nothing is really sacred. Not the<br />stuckup and officious Omega House rush, whose boring members will run the real world,<br />unfortunately. Not the college, with it's Cretaceous period Rex dean and his thunder-<br />lizard image. Faber's dean hates Animal House and wants to put his foot down right<br />smack on the roof of the wild frat house. What Dean Wormer wants depends on a lot<br />of people--Otter, the stallion, Neidermeyer who is in the ROTC Calvary, Blutarsky,<br />learning about women in a college way and also about cafeteria decor, the happily<br />happily mellow professor played by the late Donald Sutherland. It's important not to<br />leave out Flounder who donated his brother's car. The best 109 minutes I ever spent<br />in college, lots of times. I might add.<br /><br />I rented this, but it will soon be on the shelf with other fine films of great<br />import ale. A great time for everyone. Will you pass me another?<br /><br />-.-

0525953728|5.0|I just don't see what all the to-do over this book is about having just read it cover to cover. While it doesn't praise Obama the way he thinks he should be glorified over the action, it certainly doesn't denigrate him either. Having relatives in the service, I see it as a straight forward account of a very historical action done by men who were just doing their jobs and were not looking for any kind a accolades. It tells a little about the author's background and how he came to be a SEAL, but in no way does he seems to pat himself on the back.<br /><br />Just a good read about some of our very best. No one does it like America with class and selflessness.  Several charities that benefit families of fallen Navy SEALS are mentioned in the epilogue and I plan to donate to each one.<br /><br />Good job, Mark Owen.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game.  Absorbing,  challenging,  fascinating. Lovely to look at, easy to listen to, satisfying to beat. The best game I've found so far.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I saw this in the cinema and like it. Picked up the DVD and enjoyed every minute of this show. Well worth the purchase.
0307719219|2.0|I really enjoyed the history and really wanted to like the book but a few things take away from that.<br /><br />The first was the fact the the authors chose to say extractive or inclusive possibly 100 times per chapter. This got old quickly. I felt like someone was trying to brainwash me. :)<br /><br />The second being the much more important complaint. The authors DO NOT spend enough (any???) time assessing ongoing society and have really cherry picked which past institutions to focus on. Generally, or quite possible 100%, of the extractive societies they chose were also authoritarian and frequently used violence and/or kept whatever they extracted to themselves/those close to them. What about Europe today or the United States??? Both seem to be a blend of extractive/inclusive, with Entitlements being the extractive portion, but it is now shared with millions instead of a few. How can the authors not talk about any of this? Good? Bad? Inconclusive? I know a lot of people have theories on this and I really thought that this book was going to help answer some of this.<br /><br />To me, this was a big failure of the book because I think it can be easily gleaned from their research that Property Rights and Safety are the main components to creating a rich country.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The only thing I didn't like was having to start from beginning when I had to replace my kindle. Other then that,  its a good game.
B002DD67XG|5.0|Not much is needed to be said.It's James Taylor,that explains it. All the hits are classic and if you didn't like JT ,you wouldn't be here reading this opinion.He is great and this collection of his best is simply that,the best.I guess all MP3 files leave a bit to be  desired sound wise so much sound and so compacted.But even though the MP3, James sounds great on this particular file.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I bought this book with reservation. A coworker loved it and told me it was a must read. Another coworker said don't bother. In looking at the reviews online its 50/50.<br />So...as for me, I didn't think it was all its been hyped up to be. Its just OK.<br />(Spoiler alert)<br />I kept reading and waiting for \\"the good part\\". But I had to skip to chapter 7 to really get into it (then I went back to read and fill in the gaps).<br />Its not a hard read. The visuals are OK. It appears that the next book delves in deeper and the 3rd even deeper. I've read other books that have more sexually charged subject matter. So I guess it depends on whether you want to read a story with sex or read about sex in a story. In my opinion, its a bit on the tame side......but then too I'm only 2/3 of the way finish with book 1.<br />Will I read book 2 and 3...probably not. But maybe after the movie comes out, I might.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|As a female, and one NEVER into comics or superhero stuff, (not a fan of the Batmans or Spidermans or Supermans...) I must say this is hands down one of the BEST movies I have ever seen, EVER!  In my entire life (of 43 years) I have seen and loved many, many movies. (And others, not so much) This is the first and only movie I have ever seen in the theater that I saw a second, and THIRD time in the theater (thereby paying more than waiting for it to come out) that I said I would actually pay yet again to see it in the theater BECAUSE IT WAS JUST THAT GREAT!  I can't wait for it to come out so I can buy it.  The cast was outstanding together, they couldn't have chosen better characters to play these roles, they were all perfect.  If they lose anyone to sequels (i.e. replace main characters with other actors) I won't watch.  ***********SPOILER ALERT*************  I am super bummed about Agent Coulson though, so I am really hoping they surprise me and bring him back somehow in the sequel coming in 2015.  I am also super excited about another Iron Man (3) and Captain America (2) but pray they don't beat it to death and ruin the integrity of how awesome all of these have been!

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I had been looking forward to the release of this album for months. I discovered Frank Ocean late last year and was instantly captivated by his voice and his music. This is a terrific album. Frank Ocean explores themes and topics which are typically unconventional in mainstream music and blends them perfectly into a fusion of r & b, hip hop and neo-soul. It makes for easy listening and is a welcome departure from the bland and superficial music which exists today. I would recommend this album to everyone and I hope Frank wins all the major awards this year.He deserves it!

B0025UHKNS|1.0|If you buy this product be prepared for some trouble. I have had mine back to Garmin 3 times - once for backlight going out and 2 for the product going dead and would not charge. This is a recurring problem with this product and Garmin has not addressed it yet. They tend to want to blame the customer for not charging correctly etc. After receiving my 3rd refurbished item, the item now will just change screens at random---I will be on a training run and look down and it shows satellites etc. This product is not a reliable performer. To their credit Garmin did replace my unit 3 times but always with a refurbished product. For the money - get something more reliable.

After reading the book myself, I'm guessing that most of the negative reviewers haven't even read the book.<br /><br />The author doesn't seem to have any political agenda.  He does express some frustration and contempt for politicians and other professional hand-wringers.  He does mention Obama by name, but that is who happened to be President at the time.  My sense is that he would have said something similar if anyone else had been President.<br /><br />It's hard for me to imagine that anyone thinks the author has done more harm than the Administration \\"leakers.\\"  (For example, the author didn't rat out the Pakistani physician who helped out.  We can thank the current administration for that.)  The book doesn't reveal any secrets or anything really new.  I guess the biggest criticism would be author's claim that he is writing the book to \\"set the record straight.\\"  I didn't notice any huge differences in his story and the \\"official\\" accounts.<br /><br />I'll leave it to the SEALS to judge the author's motives and character, but I thought the book was pretty good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is one of the best books I've ever read. There is love, kinkyness, and a bit of action. I love this book do much I've read it twice already and both times it sucks you right into the story. Totally worth reading
B008IEFP1E|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of the band. I listened to the album on Spotify and really liked it. So I bought it. I think it's the bands best album. A lot of catchy tunes and very well produced. I also think that Amazon had a 5 dollar download special.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and addicting game.  very easy to play!  glad I downloaded it.<br />building the community and playing game is enjoyable
B006964E8S|4.0|The book takes a long time to get into the real action. Indeed, its not until the last quarter that new action happens.  When it does, it becomes explosive.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Works great. Seems pretty indestructible. Can just throw it in my bag and go. Great design and feel. I like it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I also have this game on my ipod, I enjoy it a lot. Its a great game to pass time but also enjoyable.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I just can't believe how much I loved this book!  This poor boy's entire life is spent in ROOM.  Great point-of-view story.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|This movie makes all the old Batman movies with George Clooney look like The Dark Knight. I'd rather watch Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze 10 times in a row than watch Ryan Reynolds make magical green hot wheels car plow through a sweaty guy with alien powers. This movie is garbage. Ryan Reynolds should have stuck with Deadpool, not this green turd.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed the books vey much. I read them twice. Fell in love with characters. I read the trilogy in one week , I was hooked.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Takes the Beatles music we grew up with it and puts it to life in a story related to that time.
B007TML4EI|5.0|I am certainly not the developer of any game so you all can't say that &quot;all the 5 star reviews are from the developers&quot;!<br /><br />The game runs without a hitch on my Acer A510 tablet. It's a fun and challenging game! I've not played one like it before. It gets a little frustrating at times and makes you work your brain for sure. No doubt I will play it a lot.<br /><br />I recommend this game for those who enjoy thinking puzzle games.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|I don't like phone gaming very much but this game was pretty cool. Nice game to waste time and it can also be very challenging.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|Loved this movie and especially the music.  It is a fairy tale, but just believable enough to keep adult interest.  Our grandchildren thought it was outstanding.  I also bought the CD soundtrack.  The last track is a version of La Bamba that I really liked.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is a delightful read for those who want to get a taste of indian culture from the perspective of a foreigner living there. Besides the culture, this book offers the reader a variety of topics and genres all beautifully merged in one story. I haven't finished the book yet, but I' m excited to see what comes next! Gregory David Thomas is a genius at story-telling, and at really making the reader feel as if they are right there in the middle of the action with the characters and the mysterious protagonist. Highly recommended!
B0000C1733|5.0|Before I bought this greatest hits compilation, I was a casual Peppers fan.  I liked every song of theirs I'd heard on the radio.  But I was late to the party, so what better way to get to know them better than to buy their best to date.  Of course, many would argue as to what constitutes their best, and I'm no exception.  As a more \\"mature\\" listener, I am more predisposed to enjoy their ballads over some of their hip hop lyrics.  But even \\"Suck My Kiss\\" has grown on me.  My friend's teenage sons (now 20 somethings) were surprised that we shared the same taste in music.  That shouldn't surprise anyone, though, given the melodic range of this group.  They literally have something for everyone.  Hard core fans may consider some of their songs to be sell-outs, but isn't it riskier to alienate your most ardent fans?  They're risk takers, and the Peppers have the chops to pull it off.  I'm partial to \\"By the Way\\" and \\"The Other Side\\", but I can listen to this disc from end to end.<br /><br />There are a couple of deficiencies, however, both of which are found on the \\"By the Way\\" CD:  \\"The Zephyr Song\\" and \\"Dosed.\\"  The former is included on the DVD but not on the CD, while \\"Dosed\\" is found on neither.  That haunting ballad is one of my favorite Peppers' tunes, and every time I hear it on the radio, I wish I had it.  The only solution, I guess, is to download the MP3 or buy the \\"Buy the Way\\" CD.  Worse things could happen.
B0086700CM|5.0|Wonderfully additive! !  Keeps me coming back! Easy to play.  Gets me away from the everyday.  Told my friends they should play to.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|awesome a great app for some one who likes CHRIST and the BIBLE I love Christ and the Bible :)
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I've seen a lot of complaints about this watch that, after using it for about a month, don't apply to an average runner. I was concerned by the reviews that said the bezel was difficult to operate while running. I have not had that problem, even while running in 90 degree heat and sweating. But for the most part, I don't have to use the bezel while I'm running. I set it. I lock it and go. The software gives me my splits. And since you can customize what constitutes a \\"lap\\" (the default is a mile) there isn't much for me to fool with on my run. I, too, used to own a 305. This is not a 305. If I wanted the bigger face and buttons, I would have gotten another 305 or 310xt. I find those complaints to be irrelevant because the size difference is clear on the website.<br /><br />One note: Garmins are not known for having great HRMs. The HRM on this watch is much improved from my 305. The sensors need to be wet when you put it on, but thats no big deal.
B005K8QIS0|1.0|I was so excited to finally receive Case Histories being such a fan of the Kate Atkinson novels. But when I put it into my DVD player, the player couldn't play it - the DVD made in the UK was not compatible with my Australian DVD player. So alas, no watching for me. Make sure you have the right DVD player before buying this!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|wonderful book the best of her books it<br /><br />keep you wondering . I did not want this book to end .
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Just get it. It's kept me busy for 3 days now. Beautiful game, great controls, and tons of levels. Bawk!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I had to give this a go due to all the hype despite reading some scathing reveiws.<br />Mummy porn is the most accurate description I have heard for this book. It is quite badly written and the amount of times \\"oh my\\" is used nearly caused the destruction of my kindle. The sexual encounters are described quite vividly and were the only things that kept me reading. I dont think that I have ever started a trilogy without reading all of the books but in this case, I will not be reading them unless they are borrowed as I have no desire to own them, let alone pay for the privilage of reading them.
B002LBKDYE|3.0|The video is probably as advertised.But personally, I've not been able to watch it since I don't have any blu-ray player. I had thought that my PC would play it since I've always been able to play other commercial and non-commercial dvd's without problems, but the pc does not even mount the disc. So, I tried our tv dvd player...Oops! That's not a blu-ray player either.<br />So, If you plan on purchasing this DVD be sure that you have something to play it on, unless you are just going to use it for a coaster. ;)<br />I'm purchasing a new blu-ray / cd player burner for my computer.
B002TU1Q3Y|5.0|This book is such a good read that I read it every 10 years or so. The detail was thoroughly researched. A pleasure to read.
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|Just like Rocky, this is a movie with a lot of fighting that's not about fighting.  This is about two brothers trying to survive their past.  Each has taken their own path in life, and this fighting tournament has brought them back into each others life.  This movie is dark and gritty, but great.  I read a bunch of reviews before I watched it, and I felt kinda let down for about the first 2/3 of the movie.  I was thinking that it was okay, but not great.  If you're like me, just stick it out and give the whole thing a shot.  The story really starts to come together towards the end, and it's worth your time.  Great flick.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|Donnie Darko gives me a serious flashback to middleschool. The best time of my public school life. The montage with Tears4fears was an instant trigger. If u grew up in the 80's u know what I'm talking about. What makes a great film is how often u re-watch it and never get bored.
B0055SWM08|5.0|What a surprisingly fun and addictive game! And only 99 cents! Definitely money well spent. I would recommend this one to family and friends.
0525953728|5.0|The book grabbed my attention and I was not going to stop reading til I was done. Hearing the stories through the operators eyes was something else. You'll laugh at the funny stories and hang on every serious word in this book as you get closer and closer to the UBL kill. BUY THIS BOOK! and then give it to a democrat who was never going to buy it anyways so they can read it and hopefully they will feel as proud of our servicemen as I know YOU do
B0027MJU00|5.0|It took a little while to get into this book but after that I could not put it down. The book was very good and I can't wait till the movie comes out.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The first season of the Walking Dead was entirely too short, but it left with us a certain feeling that everything was about to change, and not all for the better.<br /><br />Well, technically the second season is superior. Emotionally, this is the sort of horror-drama survival roller coaster where it comes crashing down to an end. And fans of the books are excited to make the next step of season three.<br /><br />Now, as far as the BD is concerned, we've got a pretty nice treat. The featurettes are nicely edited, so that's not a lot of rehashing \\"oh, so-and-so did such an amazing job at whatever\\". The webisodes, which I had never watched before, felt a little weak but the reveal makes it all worthwhile. No spoilers - the fans will love it.<br /><br />We are also given commentary with almost everything, from the selected episodes to the webisodes, and the deleted and alternate scenes. And the Holy Grail - haunting 7.1, edited where you think you hear something and you instantly want to know what made said noise. It's creepy how well it works.<br /><br />Something tells me we will see a \\"Director's Cut\\" release sometime upcoming, just as they did with the first season. And like with the first season, I'll buy that version, too. If only to give support to the great guys and gals who make this one of the best shows on TV.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|The Chess Free app is a great simple chess game.  I say simple because the pieces aren't complex in appearance but the game functions very well.
0525423281|5.0|I haven't read Anna and the French Kiss yet, but this book was so good that I've added it to my must read list because someone said they liked it as much as Lola. I don't know if that's possible, but I liked Lola so much I'll try it!
B0073ODRKG|5.0|... and I assume that's coming later (and when it does, Warner Bros, you better do a true box set justice, not another cheap job like this.  Start with the gayest design company you can find so the box won't be as tacky as this one... fire whatever boring ass chick came up with this cover artwork and dulled out gold design).  BUT in the meantime it's a nice little collection for die hard fans, a good way to look back and even re-discover the CDs that were considered disappointments but are actually quite wonderful (see \\"American Life\\").  The little cardboard covers are cool enough since we're all sick of that plastic piling up in landfills and it's nice to have them all in one place, just like my Smiths box set.  There's nothing new here but get it for the right price (see the Marketplace) and it's a good deal for fans -- or their offspring who need introduction to one of the great pop stars.
B005P06AAO|5.0|Title of review says it all!  Show was.a lot funnier than I thought. I will probably buy the 2nd season when it comes out.
B007TMON8M|3.0|While this game does not really follow the physics by the book it does provide simple fun. There are about 12 physics based puzzles that you need to solve. The graphics are cool. The interface is simple and while it not impossible to solve the puzzles it does take considerable amount of time to construct the structures within the allotted expenses.<br /><br />I have seen similar other games like [[ASIN:B004SPETQ4 X Construction]] which also behave similarly. Nonetheless Simple Physics is entertaining and a good game to have.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I knew when I decided to read this series that many were questioning the literary merit of this series, but I didn't think it would ever be so poorly written and the subject matter so shallow.  If you want to read about the same two plastic people having sex over and over and over and over and over......this book is for you.  I personally found it boring, poorly written, lacking any type of real story line and just honestly a real insult to anyone who likes to read good literature.  Save your time and money!
B008ASLQZW|1.0|It was a very poor sequel to a first good movie, seems as though they lost the recipe or opted to make changes not proven on previous success.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I almost always find what I'm looking for or great ideas on pintrest. from school to my 3 1/2 year old to recipes to home decor ideas. its great! sometimes the links Robt work. but I move on.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game! I can't get enough.  I totally recommend this game. I have always loved. thlo play solitaire before but it seems a lot easier then before.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Not my usual read, but I liked the Longmire TV series, and decided to try the book.  There is a lot more humor in the book than the show, but that's ok.  The book would be really dark otherwise.  Good story, told in first person, not my favorite, hence four stars.  I would recommend for any mystery reader.  A good way to spend a rainy afternoon.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell is challenging and relaxing at the same time. The music is soothing, the colors don't bother my eyes and occupies my mind without stressing me out. The only thing I don't like is that the hints aren't actually on fb like the option suggests.
B005F3XV62|2.0|I like Kevin James, but this movie is terrible, the idea of the Zookeeper who was able to communicate with animals sounded very good, but the story line is dry and really boring, I was unable to watch the whole thing, I felt it was a waste of my time, I gave it 2 stars just because the special effects of the animals is quite good.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Other than Amazon raising the price by $3 within 2 days time (30%), this light is fantastic!<br /><br />I got it for the purpose of lighting a huge corner cabinet, often referred to as a Lazy Susan. The middle shelf blocked light, so you really couldn't see your pots & pans on the lower shelf very well. This light solved that problem with ease! Now every time I open the cabinet hinged double-door, and ever so slightly lean over - the light comes on.<br /><br />Because these are LED lights, which are powered with 4 AA batteries, I expect from experience that the batteries will last at least one full year before they need to be changed. The Hipe comes with screws, hollow wall anchors, and one hefty 3M Velcro - which I used.<br /><br />I will buy more of these Hipe lights for sure - but only AFTER Amazon reduces that 30% price increase they just tacked on.<br />Be well,<br />Jeff
030758836X|4.0|It took me a little while to get into this book. If you are feeling the same, stick with it! However, the ending was terrible. I was expecting an amazing climax, after the twisted psychological foundation Flynn laid out wonderfully. Overall: a very, very disappointing ending that was completely asynchronous with the rest of the book but still worth reading.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|awesome. it is a fun game but it makes me mad when you cant do the rescue mode until you finish the whole chapter of run

141970642X|3.0|First there was the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book, said to be a realistic fiction novel, by Jeff Kinney, which appeared on FunBrain.com in 2004 and was released in hardcover on April 1, 2007.  Next, there have been several sequels, including Rodrick Rules (2008), The Last Straw (2009), Dog Days (2009), The Ugly Truth (2010), the only one that I have read, and Cabin Fever (2011).  The seventh, The Third Wheel, is scheduled for release on November 13, 2012.  Then there was a Diary of a Wimpy Kid film that was released by 20th Century Fox on March 19, 2010.  After that, there were two more movies, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules, based on book two of the Wimpy Kid series in 2011, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days based on books three and four in 2012.<br /><br />  Now, there is a tie-in book, written by Kinney, called The Wimpy Kid Movie Diary.  It was originally published in 2010 and included film stills, script pages, storyboards, preliminary concept drawings, some new illustrations, and also behind the scenes information to chronicle in a humorous way the making of the film. The latest edition gives the story of all three movies.  It begins with some background information about the original book, explains how it was made into a film, and then tells about the two movie sequels.  Though the books, which chronicle in diary form how Greg Heffley relates to his dad Frank Heffley, his mom Susan Heffley, his older brother Rodrick, his little brother Manny, his best friend Rowley Jefferson, other kids at school, and people in the neighborhood, have been highly praised and very popular, I must be honest and say that they do not hit my hot button at all.  However, those who do like the Wimpy Kids books and movies will undoubtedly enjoy this companion to the series and find it interesting.
B0051UH6YM|1.0|The book could be entertaining and educational in a regular paper printed format.  This is the type of book that you need to be able to flip back and forth for reference which is most difficult with the Kindle.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it.  I play it everyday!!! It has been the best app for my kindle and gets the most play.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Super fun and addictive game. Music is a little lame but you can turn it off. Good level design and concept.

B0074MZSWW|4.0|The debut from Alabama Shakes is a wall rattler. Fronted by a rock wailer named Brittany Howard, the band kicks in with a (sadly) low-fi amplifier buzz and a Tyrannosaurus stomp. Even with the primitive recording, there's no escaping that these four folks are the real deal, mixing their rock with R'n'B and Howard's force 10 voice. I was fortunate enough to catch them live at 2012's Newport Folk Festival and was so blown away that I had to get the CD as soon as I got home. They've got that much dynamism live, and \\"Boys and Girls\\" catches the better part of it.<br /><br />Alabama Shakes are not a band you'll walk away from without an opinion. From the thunderous \\"Rise to The Sun\\" and the bluesy first single \\"Hold On,\\" they exude personality and muscle. They also know how to work up a sweat (the Stones-like \\"Be Mine\\") or tease some Jack White humor (the brief story of a night gone hinky on \\"After The Party\\"). One almost hopes Jack White, who always seems to work magic with strong women in rootsy settings, gets a hold of them before someone slickens the band up for the sophomore effort. I'm already worried that the fans who have discovered this raw and young band (they've only been together for a couple of years) will be screaming sell-out once they get some polish. Frankly, that's something I think they need a little more of.<br /><br />Just don't let that stop you from enjoying \\"Boys and Girls\\" now. Alabama Shakes make the most of their youth and Howard's raw talent. i am already wondering and hoping for what they grow into over time.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Great little puzzle game.  The soothing music really helps to set the tone.  The pithy commentary as you complete, or fail to complete, the levels adds to the enjoyment.  The background graphics are beautiful and scroll smoothly, completing the whole package.
B004IY6API|4.0|For Judas Priest, &#34;Stained Class&#34; was the album where the band's sound coalesced into what became the classic priest sound. Glenn Tipton and KK Downing began their speed-metal roar, while Rob Halford's operatic wail began reaching new heights of aggression. From the thunderous opener of &#34;Exciter&#34; to the gothic morbidity of &#34;Beyond The Realms of Death,&#34; the new wave of British Heavy Metal used this album as the eye to their mammoth hurricane. Any band who wants to claim otherwise (with the possible exception of Motorhead) can - as &#34;Exciter&#34; puts it - &#34;fall to your knees and repent if you please.&#34;<br /><br />There was a real sense of purpose the &#34;Stained Class,&#34; as the band ditched any previous blues references and proggy ballads to just ram home their heavy metal vision. The music is often violent and macabre (&#34;Savages&#34; tales of citizens' revolts) or just anthems of rock-helmets everywhere (&#34;White Heat, Red Hot&#34;). There's even the song that put the band in front of a ludicrous court trial when &#34;Better By You Better Than Me&#34; was accused of causing a teen to commit suicide via backwards masking of a lyric telling him to &#34;do it.&#34; Even crazier, it was one of Priest's journey into the realm of odd choices for cover songs, this one from Spooky Tooth. Like their cover of Joan Baez's &#34;Diamonds and Rust,&#34; &#34;Better By You&#34; gets turned inside out and gets a bonus dose of heavy metal drama.<br /><br />The real drama is &#34;Beyond The Realms of Death,&#34; where Halford really pours on the dramatics. He cries about living in a world full of sin that he no longer wants any part of, and taunts the listener with his desire to leave. (Funny how this song wasn't the one on trial.) Tipton and Downing let loose with a Sabbath worthy riff behind Halford until the song hits its climax...and leads into &#34;Hero's End,&#34; where Halford poses the question &#34;Why do you have to die to be a hero?&#34; There's a lot of power between these two songs, a formula that Priest would refine even more come &#34;Hell Bent For Leather.&#34; But if you need to pinpoint the record where Priest reached critical mass, &#34;Stained Class&#34; is it.t of power between these two songs, a formula that Priest would refine even more come &#34;Hell Bent For Leather.&#34; But if you need to pinpoint the record where Priest reached critical mass, &#34;Stained Class&#34; is it.

B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I installed this app on my android phone some time ago. It took a little playing with it, to decipher how to use it, but once I figured it out, I've LOVED it. This app allows you to \\"layer\\" the sounds.... makes them blend naturally. You are able to set the volume for each sound, making it prominent or more of a background noise. There are many options as to how you want the app to work, as well... whether you want an alarm feature, sleep timer (with multiple options), set notifications... you name it. The flexibility is unreal. A review I read stated that Lighting Bug allows you to rest your mind, simply listing to the endless options of sounds... this does work. I'm always asleep before the sleep timer. The visual effects are amazing too! Lightning strikes with the lightning sound, lighting bugs fly around (and you can change how many of 'em, and their color). It's fun to play with and change around. I'm glad I purchased this (twice) and will go to bed now!
B0029LHWL8|4.0|Came on time, and in excellent condition! However, the reason I give this product four stars instead of five, is the cover was not as advertised. I did opt for the cheaper version that was brand new, and expected to receive the orange&blue as advertised above. The cover was different, purple and just as lovely in itself. And It might be nitpicky, but as an avid reader, it was what I wanted to hold in my hands. The book I received was in great condition, unused, sealed and unopened...but just not what I was expecting nor exactly what I wanted.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This game works great on my HTC Thunderbolt, but it crashes my Motorola Xoom as soon as it starts up. Xoom is on Jelly Bean 4.0.4.... please fix this.. that is the only thing holding my rating from a 5...
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was a beautiful read.  The author described the circus in such imaginative detail and wove such an interesting story around it.  The story kept me turning pages -- I was sad when it ended.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was disappointed with the ending! I feel as if the author ran out of ideas and was working against a deadline.  In addition, the characters were unlikable. However, I liked the first 1/2 of the book. As I continued to read this mystery novel I heard myself asking  (several times) out loud, \\" Oh, come on, this would never happen in real life!\\"
030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl was literally a novel that I could not put down.  Flynn's storytelling is spectacular.  Nick Dunne is the the hometown golden boy who has returned home to care for his ailing parents and is the number one suspect in his wife's disappearance.  Amy Dunne is his uprooted wife who was dragged from her beloved New York City to Missouri and has gone missing. Each chapter alternates from the point of view of the husband to the point of view of the wife (going back in time to when they first met and eventually getting to the present).  This thriller is unlike any I have ever read and I loved everything about it up to the ending.  As amazing as the book was, I detested the ending.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found the book interesting and informative. I especially liked the fact that bin Laden was exposed as the gutless coward that he was. I think every Muslim should be forced to read this book. I applaud Mr. Bissonnette for having the courage to write what really happened.
B0000C1733|3.0|This CD is what started my love for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. But, as I listened and learned more about them, I found out this left out a LOT of good material. The fact that they included \\"Universally Speaking\\" instead of \\"Can't Stop\\", one of their number one hits, is a little insulting. And it only contains material from five of their eight albums they made before releasing Greatest Hits. All of it, except for \\"My Friends\\" was done with John Frusciante as guitarist. They easily could have taken out \\"Universally Speaking\\", \\"Breaking The Girl\\" and \\"Parallel Universe\\" with \\"Knock Me Down\\", \\"The Zephyr Song\\", \\"Aeroplane\\", \\"Fight Like A Brave\\" and maybe even \\"Around The World\\". Honestly, above all, the absence of \\"Can't Stop\\" is the biggest disappointment. Anyway, for all the people wanting to know about the tracks on the album, here's my thoughts.<br /><br />1. Under The Bridge - An essential. This is my all time favorite song and features outstanding writing by Anthony Kiedis. And ironically enough, its 'bridge' is possibly the greatest bridge ever. Originally from Blood Sugar Sex Magik.<br /><br />2. Give It Away - Another essential. This is what catapulted the Red Hot Chili Peppers into mainstream funk rock icons. This won them a Grammy, a lot of fame and their first Modern Rock chart number one. Originally from Blood Sugar Sex Magik.<br /><br />3. Californication - VERY overrated song. It's great, but people call it the best Red Hot Chili Peppers song ever. And, sadly, it is their most well-known. Unsurprisingly it went number one. Again, it's good, the way Kiedis rhymes every word with something very similar to \\"Dani California\\" (which was made years after the Greatest Hits CD was released). Originally on Californication.<br /><br />4. Scar Tissue - A beautiful song, a close second for my favorite song. Kiedis' painful lyrics combined with Frusciante's emotional guitar is so perfect. This also won them a Grammy. Originally on Californication.<br /><br />5. Soul To Squeeze - A great ballad which was originally a B-Side from Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It was never put on a studio album, but was added to the Coneheads soundtrack. It was a hit, and earned them their second number one hit in 1992.<br /><br />6. Otherside - A famous hit from Californication. This definitely belongs on the Greatest Hits CD, being another number one hit.<br /><br />7. Suck My Kiss - A staple for RHCP fans. This one is humorous (in some ways) and is one of their heaviest songs.<br /><br />8. By The Way - The lead single from By The Way, made a year before Greatest Hits came out. A great half ballad, half headbanger about the fictional Dani California, who was also subject in Scar Tissue, Californication and the song named after her.<br /><br />9. Parallel Universe - Does not belong. It's okay, but considering all the songs that were left out, it shouldn't be here. It isn't very popular and it didn't chart well. Originally on Californication.<br /><br />10. Breaking The Girl - Another song they could've left out. I'll admit it has a good beat that gradually gets more and more intense... but still. A song that barely charted from Blood Sugar Sex Magik.<br /><br />11. My Friends - The very popular single from One Hot Minute, and the only track done with Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction) playing guitar instead of John Frusciante. It became another number one. Personally, I don't think it's that great. But it was a hit that kept the Red Hot Chili Peppers famous in the mid-90s.<br /><br />12. Higher Ground - The only 80s RHCP song here. This is the earliest single on Greatest Hits, and its all the way in their fourth 1989 album Mother's Milk. It was a famous cover of Stevie Wonder's hit. This became one of RHCP's most well known songs as well. It may be more popular than Stevie Wonder's original.<br /><br />13. Universally Speaking - Another song that doesn't belong. A single that didn't chart good from By The Way.<br /><br />14. Road Trippin' - This isn't popular and it didn't chart well, but I like it. Althought it doesn't belong, I'm glad they decided to keep it. Originally on Californication.<br /><br />15. Fortune Faded - The lead single from Greatest Hits. A very cool electric guitar sound. Good lyrics, too. I hope this goes on RHCP's next greatest hits CD This, along with \\"Save The Population\\" and the Blood Sugar Sex Magik songs were all recorded in \\"the Mansion\\" which Harry Houdini had lived in.<br /><br />16. Save The Population - A new track that didn't become a single. Decent sound.<br /><br />So, overall, I don't think this is a good place to start for newcomers. The only reason to get this album is the liner notes, which each member wrote about what its like to be a Red Hot Chili Pepper, and the new tracks. A much better place to start would be Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Californication, By The Way or Stadium Arcadium.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|Sons Of Anarchy is an Awesome TV show. Great episode first episode of season 4. Love amazon prime on line viewing.  Worth every single penny I spend.
B006LSZECO|1.0|There are must better books to read, don't waste your time on this one. Can't understand why it has been on best sell list for so long. I was taken it by all the reviews, and deceided to read it, ended up skipping most. Perhaps just not my kind of book. I want to like the characters.  For me there are many much better books and too little time to spend on this one.

1400069289|5.0|The book was not only a great leisure read but also helpful to those in the business world.  The examples provided by Duhigg show how simple behavioral changes in an organization can drastically change the functionality of a business.  I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to better understand their own personal actions or for leaders who are trying to think outside the box to improve their organizations.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am a little past half way reading the last book of the 3 in the series. They have been very hard to put down, very interesting and well written. I can't wait until the next movies, although I know the books include much more detail.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's masterful Black Swan is as mind-blowing a movie experience as I've ever had. Natalie Portman is simply amazing as Nina Sayers, a ballet dancer whose sole desire is to be perfect in her craft. Why this makes for such an interesting character study is thanks to bravura acting, brilliant direction, great writing, and a stirring musical score. Black Swan kept me interrested, and then it knocked me off my feet, and never let off. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey round off the other central characters, and they are all terrific, but it's definitely Portman's film and she most deservingly received an Oscar for her powerhouse work. Black Swan has elements of Drama, Thriller, Horror, and Dark Comedy, and it plays them all perfectly. I believe this to be Aronofsky's best film to date, and Portman's best work on film. I highly recommend this film!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|fun to use;  good action although the \\"paddles\\" could be a little<br /> more responsive.  Have only tried one of the options so far.

B007SGM084|5.0|Book is well written and the descriptions are great! I could literally see everything happening as I read. I've heard people say that it was just too much for them but besides all that, the story line is great! I could not put these books down and when I finished them, I re-read them to make sure I didn't leave anything out. I had book hangover on this series for a while.

B0092MKTL2|5.0|So, i had 5$ in mp3 downloads to spare. Looking around the site, i happpened upon this beauty. #1 on the list, i gave it a sample. Suddenly, i was completely obsessed with Imagine Dragons. Their music is very relatable, has beautiful melody and lyrics. I went through the 11 tracks three times in a row because it is so great. I cant wait for their upcoming album, and am looking at many of their other singles. There is a story being told in every song, with raw emotions including sadness, joy, love. Buy this album, you won't regret it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am mad. I could have been using this site to put all my favorite things a long time ago but I thought it would be to hard to figure out. I is so easy and now I can see everything that interests me on the net in one place.

B005LAIHSG|3.0|When I saw the trailer, I thought it's going to be an awesome movie. I ended up being a bit disappointed because it started great and dark, but the more the movie progressed, they added silly,useless scenes that ruined the whole atmosphere. It was OK for one time watch...

B006M7JCC2|5.0|I am so grateful that I found this book.I stumbled upon the link to this book from the twitter entry of Dr Wayne Dyer.<br />What I liked most about this book and what makes it different than any of the books I have read in the same field is that this book walks through the real life experiences of Anita which I can relate to in many ways.It is the true knowledge that has come out of Anita's profound direct experience with the divine.This book does not have any religious agenda behind it and does not preach any do's or don'ts list of Mantras, meditations etc.It completely changed my thoughts regarding the religion and rituals I use to follow.After reading this book,now I question everything I do whether I am doing it out of love or out fear.I am surprised to realize that almost all of the religious practices I used to follow are fear based,They all promote more or less some kind of fear towards the God and less self love and that is how the belief system has been established.But now that I know I can choose my own way.Thank you Anita for sharing your wonderful experiences and bringing me this true knowledge which is life changing in Many ways.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app.  I have pre-set my daily alarm time and it hasn't failed me yet.  I also enjoy getting to choose what sound I want to use.  It also allows me 10 minute snoozes.  It is very easy to set the alarm time.  Set and forget.  I keep my Fire plugged in by my bed overnight and in the morning I am gently awakened by my preset alarm.  I also like being able to set more than one alarm.  Excellent app for a free one.  I'd get it again.

034580404X|1.0|I dont know what condition the product is in because it was not delivered to the person I sent it to, ONTRAC delivery service \\"which Ive never heard of\\" states on there site that the package was delivered five days ago and that it was left behind the front gate. Funny thing is my friend dose not have a front gate at his apartment, also in my order history this product which is being sold by amazon.com dose not have an option to file a claim or contact seller if you have any problems. The only option I was able to find was under the help menu which only advised me to contact the carrier, I tried but Unfortunately for me they are not open on the weekends. So with that said my friend still dose not have his gift and I'm left with no other options on amazon but to call the carrier, wish me luck...

B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|This set comes in 24 individual wrapped mini sets, each tucked into a box labeled 1-24. The building instructions for each set is pictured on the inside of the door of each box. The idea is to open one box each day for the month of December until Christmas. But we opened ours early!<br /><br />My son and I love this set. There are lots of unique pieces and they are a great addition to last year's Lego Star Wars advent calendar. The mini flyers are so cute and well designed. My son loves to battle with all the little flyers. The nice thing is that this keeps him busy for hours at a time. He takes everything out, then he puts everything back into the little boxes. The Darth Maul Santa is especially cool! The only downside is that it's a bit pricey for the number of Lego pieces you get.

B004IQMXD4|1.0|While I must admit I love Stevie Nicks, bought all her main albums and strongly adored her effort on 'Trouble in Shangri La'... I honestly hate this album. Stevie Nick's lyrics here are contrived and the same ole subject matter of 'lost loves' she now uses like a gimmic with very little depth here just to get through another round. It's like she has lost touch with herself- and is living superficially now attempting to draw on resources that she has not replenished for a long time.<br /><br />I know how she feels about 'losing a love' we are obsessed with at one time or the other...but for this project-it churns out like a ole B rated flick. It is sad to see her not mature in the later years. Her thought processes are now stuck with no deep dimension whatsoever. Honestly- she started to explore those themes on Trouble in Shangri La. But now she has regressed back. She sounds bored and even more trivial than she ever has before. She sounds more trivial than when she wrote the song \\"Sometimes it's a bitch' which was a ridiculous and stupid song. Of course she has always been self focused and self centered but this is an all time low.<br /><br />To bad she doesn't explore more meaningful avenues. On Shangri La she added some type of spiritual dimension to her lyrics even if it is the same ole theme. It made it work amazingly...thoughtful metaphors of our place in this world and the impact we hold like a pebble to the water. With that album there are some amazing metaphors like ' I run through the grass, I run over the stones, Down to the sea, Show me the way back, honey..'.<br /><br />In contrast here this album has none of that and is almost worthless. Stevie Nicks is now stuck in this 'three chickmunks' voice sound that she derived in her later years. It has been a long time since she let her voice relax to the lower octaves like on the earlier takes such as 'Beautiful child'.<br /><br />I really hope that she makes an album about different subject matter than just lost loves. She really can be more intelligent than this...

I never could get the buttons programmed properly.  I ended up returning it.
1455502758|5.0|The brilliant and provocative, Christopher Hitchens exercised his freedom of speech with breathtaking results--as in, one literally gasps out loud at some of his statements.  His new book, \\"Mortality,\\" reprints a selection of his Vanity Fair articles--those in which he muses on his own impending death. Fans who missed these essays have been given one more chance to \\"spend time\\" with a remarkable personality.<br /><br />I approached the slim book with some trepidation. Did I really want to read an honest account of death by a writer with the skills to make it all very vivid?  I feared I might be holding the atheist equivalent of C.S. Lewis's  heartwrenching  \\"A Grief Observed\\" (about the death of Lewis's wife). Also, I had already said a sad goodbye to Hitchens by reading \\"Hitch 22: A Memoir.\\" That ramble-y autobiography, alternating between on-the-spot reporting and analysis of huge world events and chapter-long tributes to individual friends and family members, includes a preface updating his story to include a recent, grim diagnosis:  Stage Four esophageal cancer.<br /><br />\\"Mortality\\" begins with a slightly stunned, journalistic account of the author's \\"very gentle and firm deportation . . . from the country of the well . . . [to] the land of malady\\": \\"The new land is quite welcoming in its way. Everyone smiles encouragingly and there appears to be absolutely no racism . . .  As against that, the humor is a touch feeble and repetitive, there seems to be almost no talk of sex, and the cuisine is the worst of any destination I have ever visited.\\" He ponders his new predicament, trying out different ways of looking at it (Is this a battle? Can suffering make one stronger?) He engages with great minds throughout history (how did they approach death?). He wonders how to handle things in a dignified manner.<br /><br />There are vague references to blood and sores, but, you will be glad to know, Hitchens's English restraint prevents him from oversharing. His proposed handbook on cancer etiquette would \\"impose duties on me as well as upon those who say too much, or too little, in an attempt to cover the inevitable awkwardness in diplomatic relations between Tumortown and its neighbors.\\" It is reassuring to see that Hitchens's lifelong concerns remain his concerns to the end. When these issues are not front and center, as in a long section ridiculing prayer, they pop out as asides: a second-hand tip to \\"write `more like the way you talk'\\"; a Hitchslap to the Calvinists; a beautiful praise of free speech; frivolous word play; surprising observations and odd connections in the continuous search for truth.<br /><br />His illness becomes terribly painful near the end, but he only barely sketches this, as if there is little to be gained by staring at his own ravaged body. Instead, his pain causes him to worry aloud about those who are purposely tortured, to wonder whether sick people in Catholic hospitals might be disturbed viewing all those crucifixes, and to reflect on the issue of assisted suicide--in the abstract (he himself seems more inclined to try everything to survive).<br />The last chapter (not a reprint) is poignant because it consists of scraps of disconnected notes--a reminder that death always comes before we are \\"done.\\" It is also poignant as it reveals that Hitchens probably constructed his startling works from notes rather than writing them out in one inspired flourish (while gloriously drunk?) as one is tempted to imagine.  But in the end we learn that he is only mortal, like the rest of us.<br /><br />Still, some of the last lines he jotted down are absolutely perfect!  I leave it for you to discover these treasures;  but they clearly show he died true to himself.<br /><br />And that message is as much, and as little, consolation as we are going to get from this short, thoughtful book.andbook on cancer etiquette would \\"impose duties on me as well as upon those who say too much, or too little, in an attempt to cover the inevitable awkwardness in diplomatic relations between Tumortown and its neighbors.\\" It is reassuring to see that Hitchens's lifelong concerns remain his concerns to the end.

This has to be one of the most down to earth, plainly stated and gut wrenching war novels ever written. No baloney, just the heartfelt description of war at it's worst with a front row, ground level view. Read it, you'll find a new appreciation for those who have, been there, done that!

Great for all ages to watch and would recommend to many others!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book was just ok for me.  I wanted to know what all the hype was about so I read the book, watched the movie and then read the 2nd and 3rd books of the series.<br />  I really enjoy the Dystopian genre... But this trilogy was my least favorite of my recent reads.  If you're looking for something similar but better.... Try the Divergent series by Veronica Roth!
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie is a good idea but, it doesn't give you enough time to get to know all the charatures, except for the two that are chosen from the same district. From the beginning, you basically know who is going to win the hunger game, you just don't know how it will happen. Also, some of the action was controlled by the people who \\"put on the games\\" So, it really wasn't a fair fight. I think I would have liked to see a bit more intelligence when it came to the hunt and for those trying not to be detected. All in all, it was good but, I expected better with all the publicity it had received. It's worth the $16.99 I paid on Amazon, I would not pay the $24.99 I have seen posted in some stores.

It changed my view of the world.  The characters rang true for me, and pulled me in.  As always I was immersed in the stories, and read it voraciously.  As I read some of the negative reviews, I was dismayed.  This is a STORY, not a history novel.  I look forward to reading the next book . . . . .

Now, if it does even launch, it freezes and crashes. I've also been forced to restart the whole Kindle Fire as it just locked everything up for a long time. After I write this review I will uninstall the app altogether. The only reason I gave this app 2 stars is because I don't actalually HATE this app, I am hopeful the developers will fix what was once a really good app so I can reinstall it.

The start of the movie drags a bit and could have been edited down, but once John Carter arrives on Mars - its all solid action, well done effects, epic sets and an interesting story line. Those who think a lot of the story was lifted from other sci-fi stories forget that this is based on a book older than all of them - they lifted their story elements from this story!

B00846REIS|2.0|Nothing but cheap knockoff of 50 Shades but with vulger language.  Start with a 3 letter name- Eva/Ana and spiral downward thru other similarities like a step brother and sister, Eva's insecurity, wealth and even the use of the word \\"troll\\" is a copy. 50 Shades isn't exactly great writing but a whole lot better than Bared's drivel. Sexy? Not even a little bit!
0738727326|5.0|I really like this deck, because I can read them and interpret without referring to any books. The art work is beautiful. All the card names are the same as the Rider Waite deck, but, to me, easier to interpret.
B00005S6K6|5.0|This movie is excellent.  Holds through the times, realistic, true romance.  Everyone should get a chance to be with that one special person that makes you feel like no one else can.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Didn't understand what everyone was raving about. Could have done without it. Didn't hate it just wasn't crazy about it.
0812550706|3.0|I read this book with high expectations, and honestly, I was underwhelmed.  It is so highly revered on so many sci-fi book lists and is a literary fan favorite, but I just don't see what the big fuss is about.  It is a good story, it's got a good pace and interesting characters, it even grapples with some heavy themes including war, childhood, xenophobia, propaganda and the loss of innocence, but I never once, while reading it, had the sense that this was a work on the level of other great works of fiction that I've read.  An enjoyable read, and I would recommend it, but it does not belong to a special class.
B0056JJXOO|3.0|As a high school teacher I wish I could show this to my students as it does an excellent job with the story.  The fact that the leads are played by teenagers would be a draw for high schoolers, but obviously with a 2 minute scene containing nudity I can't even consider it.  Sure wish there was an edited version.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the books. I wasn't sure about reading them until one of my friends wanted to try them out. Said she had heard lots of great reviews for them and thought we needed to read them just for a treat to ourselves. So we both ordered a copy and I read all three books within a week. I was completly wrapped in these books and didn't want to put them down. I would highly recommend these to anyone who is not bothered by strong sexual content. I did find myself curious though through out the book what the other side was acctually thinking, but all in all I enjoyed the book.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I have two young granddaughters.  Every time they came to see me, they ran to the spot where I kept my movies, and still too young to talk, handed Sleeping Beauty over to the nearest adult.  Ages, 3 and 4, THEY LOVE IT!
B007SGM084|5.0|much more than its buzz about the lifestyle, this trilogy looks deeply at the complexities of loving sexual relationships and what it really takes to make your own love story sing.  Keep an open mind as you read and go past the trappings of the chick erotica/love story genre and you'll find real life lessons in relationship and sexual compromise, differences in culture and background, jealousy, past relationships and how understanding and giving way without giving up can make for a lasting and satisfying relationship...Oh, and you just might find a couple of new sex tips, too!

B0052AC8C6|4.0|Finally, an animated movie that is not flat out neutered to appeal only to children.<br /><br />As a jaded moviegoer, I have to tell you that this is the first movie in a long LONG time that made me actually laugh out loud.  Seriously.<br /><br />The humor is adult enough that I enjoyed it, and some of the themes hinted at are obscure enough that only a thoughtful adult will even catch on or appreciate it.  The comic timing is very well done.  There is some language, but nothing you won't hear in prime time television or walking past a group of adults on the street.<br /><br />I did not want to like this movie.  I actually ridiculed it when the trailer came out and it hit theaters.  I was so wrong.  It's one of my most favorite animated films now.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|I went to go see DCD last week at The Ryman in Nashville. I actually debated whether I should go or not because it had been so long. I'm so glad I went. They started out with Children of the Sun, my favorite song on Anastasis. I came home and immediately bought the album. One thing struck me. I have always loved Lisa's vocals. After watching the concert and listening to this album, I now really appreciate Brendan's voice and why the two, together, make Dead Can Dance unique. You will not be disappointed with this album.

1781003211|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1YFMZU1D58CNQ]]<br /><br />ON A TIMELY TOPIC<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />As the learned authors have expressed it, this book, published recently by Elgar has brought together a group of nine distinguished contributors from some of the world's top universities and academic institutions to discuss `the intersection of soft law and the law of international investment'.<br /><br />Author Andrea Bjorklund, for example, is Professor of Law at the University of California at Davis and visiting professor at McGill University's School of Law in Montreal.<br /><br />August Reinisch is Professor International and European Law at the University of Vienna and lectures at the Bologna Center of Johns Hopkins University. Their fellow contributors hail variously from Dundee in Scotland to Jerusalem, to Wittenberg in Germany.<br /><br />We have here, therefore, an international perspective on the topic.  The various contributors we have referred to were members of a study group that had concluded its work with the publication of the `Oxford Handbook on International Investment Law' which addressed major issues relating to both substantive and procedural investment law.<br /><br />As explained by several of the contributors, including Moshe Hirsch, who writes the second chapter, soft law rules are not legally binding and it is up to the discretion of legal decision-makers as to whether or not such rules can be applied to a particular dispute.  His chapter in particular briefly discusses, among other topics, the interactions between `soft law' (non-binding instruments) and the recognized sources of investment law.<br /><br />The views of this group of international experts do shed interesting light on such matters as GATT/WTO and certain fields in particular, namely commercial law, environmental law, as well as investment law. Fundamentally, the various chapters attempt to answer the general question of whether investment law can, or should be `codified', with special reference to such issues as most favoured nation treatment and also, expropriation.<br /><br />Extensively footnoted throughout, with a detailed index at the back, the book covers an exceptionally wide range of issues in the process of examining the topic of investment law and soft law.<br /><br />If you're involved in investment law, or government investment treaty negotiations, or arbitration proceedings -- or if you have an interest in international law and legal theory, you would do well to acquire this erudite and timely work of reference.stion of whether investment law can, or should be `codified', with special reference to such issues as most favoured nation treatment and also, expropriation.<br /><br />Extensively footnoted throughout, with a detailed index at the back, the book covers an exceptionally wide range of issues in the process of examining the topic of investment law and soft law.<br /><br />If you're involved in investment law, or government investment treaty negotiations, or arbitration proceedings -- or if you have an interest in international law and legal theory, you would do well to acquire this erudite and timely work of reference.

Numerous avenues are explored down the pathways of, for example, the history of law, the philosophy of law (jurisprudence) and the interplay and overlap between these disciplines and others, including economics in particular.<br /><br />Here's just one  example of these intriguing excursions down a particular pathway of enquiry and we quote:  `In recent years a new generation of literature, developed at the interface of law, economics and public choice theory, provides an alternative hypothesis regarding the evolution of the common law.'  Agree with this or not, the operative word here, we believe is `interface' and as the title indicates, we are talking here about inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary research.<br /><br />If this sounds a little abstruse, it is nonetheless intriguing and has a number of practical applications in law, certainly, as well as economics and public policy.<br /><br />As the editor, Pier Monateri explains, the structure of the book including the sequence of the chapters, as well as the selection of individual essays, is `designed to focus on the evolving shape of legal \\"comparativism\\".<br /><br />The result is, he adds, `an accessible manual from which scholars, students and practitioners can benefit.'<br /><br />Extensively footnoted throughout, the book takes its place as part of Elgar's `Research Handbooks in Comparative Law' series - the first of its kind, apparently, to cover such a broad range of comparative law issues.  The orientation is global; the approach scholarly.  This is a book which will no doubt interest the worldwide community of law academics and academic lawyers.  Offering up some of the latest thinking on this subject, it contains much food for thought.  The publication date is 2012.can benefit.'<br /><br />Extensively footnoted throughout, the book takes its place as part of Elgar's `Research Handbooks in Comparative Law' series - the first of its kind, apparently, to cover such a broad range of comparative law issues.

B0090EIC3Y|2.0|I love Sasha Baron-Cohen.  I thought Borat was hillarious and Bruno very good.  The Dictator I didn't like. I think the D Ali G Show was groundbreaking and his characters from those shows the absolute best.  He should carry those characters forward.  I await the (really would be second due to the British movie) D Ali G Movie.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|Can't go wrong with this one. No fancy Hollywood distractions - just bare bones story and acting.  Story of love, forgiveness, family, the kindness of strangers, and how far we should go to set our own pride and stubbornness aside for those whom we truly love.<br /><br />Everyone in here does a fantastic job. Well done. Moving and powerful, in all the right ways.

B0055MITEM|4.0|I searched for weeks for the Fi-2 as I have had them for 5+ years and since the tread is getting low, decided to get another pair.<br /><br />The price over the past 5 years has gone to a high of $90.00 and a low of $45.00. I paid $29.00 for my old pair which was a discount of<br /><br />approximately 50% at the time.<br /><br />I have been watching for a color that is brown, green, or black but so far the higher prices prevail so I have to wait.<br /><br />The sandal fits ok, it is easy to clean, it can be adjusted, and  I can climb and prune trees wearing this sandal. I can also walk the river and<br /><br />hike the trails.<br /><br />However, I find the double to triple price in the past 5 years untenable. The cost of living-COLA-reported by the Federal Government is much lower<br /><br />than the price increase. I will wait until the middle of the winter to find another pair at a more reasonable price.<br /><br />I believe the retail market has stuck it to the consumer market with this sandal especially during these deep recessionary times and for some more<br /><br />like a depression times coming out of the excesses of the Housing Bubble. I have heard that the spider rubber-trade mark name-is better than the<br /><br />Fi-2 but I would have to see it in real scientific tests to believe it.

After about 6 weeks the tred was gone and I had a hole the size of a nickle in my shoe with my toe peeking out.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was a fun read.  It was mystical and thought provoking.  It was initially a little hard to follow.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|I was not expecting to enjoy this movie, thinking that it would entail long odes to politics that I don't agree with, but it was delightful, poignant and well worth the time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful show, enjoyed every minute of it.  Incredibly well done.  The cast is magnificent, and the attention to detail is outstanding.  Why can't American stations give us something this good?

Also all of her books flow so well even though they are from different points of view of enemies, you can always go back to one book and everything match up. I have read almost every single one of her books and this one is definitely on my top favorites!

B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved the history intertwined with the mystery. The writing and vocabulary were rich with discriptions that pulled you in to the story. I have read other books by this author and have equally enjoyed her writing and story development.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|Don't do this often, but I felt I HAD to for this album. I love CDs I can listen to all the way through without having to skip a song because of unsavory content or poor musicality. This CD is one of those. It's a staple of my collection now. It's like all the good elements of 80s music and Pop with strong beats throughout. Radioactive is the perfect beginning to it -- incredible song (and no, I don't believe the audible inhalation in the beginning is a drug reference) -- but it's really rather a different tenor from the rest of the album. Even (especially?) preachers like myself can use a pick me up, and Top of the World is a super fun song that makes you feel good. But seriously, every song is either good or GREAT. Shutting up now...<br /><br />Keith
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing.
B0087HT36U|5.0|very addictive and fun!  a little slow at the beginning getting rid of the side bar.  still it's good! very fun!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|A fun book to read! Very predictable, not a great piece of literature but definitely educational in regards to the adult toys in the marketplace!
B001VZY4MS|5.0|His early stuff (this album and \\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\\") are his best. Underknown gem on this one is the instrumental \\"Emperor of Wyoming\\".
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Had I read the sample before buying, I would not have wasted my money. The book is terribly shallow, mostly couched in first-person, totally routine, pedestrian accounts. The few pages devoted to the raid were infomative, but certainly not gripping largely because of the very ho-hum writing style. This disappointing read does not change my monumental respect for our Special Operating Forces and the magnificent Seals.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|this app stinks a little but is ok to play for me it is.My sister Bates it so badly she even said it to my kindle fire.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|The Raid is by far the most insane action movie you will ever come across. I originally saw this in the theater during its brief run and was blown away by it then and was still blown away by it after watching it last night on Blu Ray. The movie starts sort of slowly (for about 10-15 minutes) by setting up who the main characters are and what is going on. After that, put your seat belt on because the next 80 minutes or so are a frenzy of gun fights, machete fights, martial arts fights and just general mayhem with enough break time thrown in for plot work and to give you time to relax. I recommend watching it in the Indonesian language setting because when I flipped on the English setting I noticed it took some wind out of the sails. The dialogue sounds like it was recorded in an empty room and felt like watching an old Godzilla movie that had been dubbed. Plus the big bad of the movie, his voice in Indonesian sounds much more evil than in the English version. Trust me or listen to it for yourself.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. The action scenes could have been better and focus more on the fights. great story and characters overall. Can't wait to see what happens next.
B001ZRYQSO|4.0|Good stuff!  Like his style and voice.  Very entertaining and thought provoking. I would say that I made<br />a nice choice by picking this album.
B000Q79HTC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It held up to the quality benchmark that was set by Robert Ludlum when he wrote the book.  While some of the technology was updated to match the movie's more up to current timeframe, it was tastefully done and updated the story.  If you are a fan of thrillers, this is a must see movie!
B000P0J09W|5.0|My 5 year-old & 10 year old fell in love with this movie.  I had a blast reliving one of my favorite movies from childhood.  Perfect condition & shipped fast.  I would highly recommend.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|I just got a blu ray player and started buying some classics for our collection. The Hitchcock classic looks gorgeous! It's so awesome to see an old movie look so crisp and clean. Truly a must have for any movie collector.
0062197258|5.0|I started reading this book at 11 at night, and I read straight to 2 am. Then of course I could not fall asleep, I was so creeped out!  It gave me the heebie-jeebies big time.<br /><br />This book is written from Catherine's point of view, but each chapter flip-flops in time.  One chapter is Catherine fours years earlier, the next is Catherine (Cathy) in the present day.  Present day Catherine struggles with her OCD; as you read more of earlier Catherine, you learn why she feels compelled to do what she does.  You see what seems to be a good relationship at first go very, very wrong.<br /><br />I think the scariest part of this book is the fact that Cathy feels she can't trust herself.  It is like that old movie Gaslight, the self doubt and and being driven crazy; the things that were done to her echo into her present day, and she is never sure that what is happening really is happening.  It could be or it could not be, it could just be a manifestation of her thoughts and fears.  You are wondering along with Cathy, never knowing what is really happening.<br /><br />This book kept me guessing, and I love that in a book! If you like psychological thrillers, this is a must read!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It is well written and fast paced.  With its premise, there is unavoidable violence, but it is handled well. A friend characterised it as \\"popcorn for the brain\\".  I agree.  It should  be  appropriate for young teenagers up.
0525953728|5.0|This first hand account of the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden is a must read! \\"Mark Owen\\" makes it clear from the Author's Note portion in the front of the book, why he wrote it. As a veteran (U.S. Air Force), I am glad he did.

B0054X3FQO|1.0|Miranda Kerr has been my favorite Victoria's Secret model since almost the start of her career with the retailer, which was why I really wanted to like her book. However, that has proved impossible. This book is yet another in a long line of celebrity publicity pieces in which beautiful, privileged people wax on about the most elemental truths of reality cloaked in new age Chopra-esque feel-goodery nonsense.<br /><br />For one thing, Miranda Kerr is not a good writer. It's obvious that she is trying, and that she is having a lot of fun sharing her thoughts in this book that reads more like a teenage girl's diary, but that effort and that enthusiasm unfortunately doesn't make up for what the book lacks. For one thing, if a couple paragraphs in a row begin with the same phrase or clause, you know you have a problem. This is an elementary style issue that any good writer would know to avoid, and any good editor would quickly slash out with red ink and fix. I guess not. The fact that the mistake persisted into the ARC makes the writing feel repetitive and clunky, and makes me think it was lazily edited. If edited at all.<br /><br />For another, there's some really strange phrasing and absurd imagery sprinkled throughout. I'm unfamiliar with the phrase \\"talk your legs off\\" when used to describe someone who is particularly chatty. I've heard \\"talk your ear off\\" before, but never heard the legs mentioned in this context. Is that an Australian thing? My apologies to the people of Oz if it is. Another such instance that took me right out of the book and had me asking aloud, \\"What?!\\" was when Miranda discussed something about positive thoughts being like a seed you plant in your heart. She asks, \\"If you planted your heart, would it grow?\\" It was such an absurd moment that I had to stop, push away my incredulity, gather my thoughts, and convince myself to continue.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't appreciate was her citing of Masaru Emoto's famed water crystal experiment. Pro-tip: just because something is well known doesn't mean it's true and/or valuable insight. For those not familiar, Dr. Emoto claims that human consciousness has an effect on the molecular structure of water. He claims that positive changes to water crystals, like whispering words of peace and love and hope, or writing such words on the cylinders, caused distilled water to form beautiful crystals when frozen, and that whispering/writing words of negativity and malice caused ugly, malformed crystal shapes or no crystals at all.<br /><br />This all sounds lovely, and Miranda certainly explains it in a lovely way. What she neglects to mention is that since Emoto wasn't educated in the scientific community, he has no problem not using the scientific method in his 'experiment.' He doesn't minimize the influence of his personal bias on the outcome of the 'research,' he didn't do any blind tests on the crystals but instead said his own aesthetic sense and character was the most important thing when taking photographs of the crystals, he didn't do a double blind study, sources of error and variation of crystal formation like temperature and humidity were not addressed, the Petri dishes used were not sealed to prevent contamination/disturbance (something as simple as his breath on the crystals when observing them with a microscope can affect the shape), he failed to publish the entirety of his photographs despite being called on to do so, his data in general is suspect since the samples are frozen at -25C, the crystals form at -5C, and yet there are no column crystals in even ONE photograph as there should be given the temperatures, and other scientists have not been able to substantiate his claims, which is the linchpin of the scientific method: that others can reproduce your results.<br /><br />His ideas are widely believed to be pseudoscience by professionals, and his claims violate basic physics, and in discussing his 'study' the way that she does, Miranda Kerr succeeds only in making herself look incredibly naive and ignorant. It's misleading and disingenuous to attempt to validate Emoto's claims in a book like this. (Or any book.)<br /><br />After reading through all these basic life truths (be assertive! be grateful! love your family and friends! be positive!), it turns out that the last half of the book is comprised of affirmations written by people like Deepak Chopra (hurl), Louise Hay, Miranda Kerr, and others. They're cute and feel-good-y and vanilla and sparkly, but it's kind of bizarre that more than half the book is made up of pages that feature one quote per page and a drawing of a butterfly.<br /><br />I did like that some of the chapters end with personal questions, though. They feel almost like journal prompts, and I like that she included those. Also, she included a ton of pictures of herself and her family, and I loved those.<br /><br />I got this book for free as an ARC, and I did not like it or find much of value in it. Instead, I found it insipid, pseudo-intellectual, and occasionally boring. It was a chore, at times, to get through. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It struck me as a great example of why some people should not write books - because not everyone has something valuable to say.<br /><br />I realize this sounds like I'm attacking Miranda Kerr. It is not my intention to do so. She's always been my favorite VS model, and I've always thought she was super cute and lovely. Though I have obvious criticism to aim at the book, I don't have any such criticism to aim at her. Though it might have been a chore at times to get through, every single page of Miranda Kerr's book speaks to the fact that she really does seem to be a very sweet, kind, optimistic, good-hearted person. I truly believe that she believes and practices what she put in this book.
B006CDCWDM|5.0|Recently, read the book but no expectations at all. Only bought because its Rafa, come on the best!! But As soon as I started reading in the third page, I loved it. I didn't want to stop reading, took the book with me everywhere. It helps you to think in your own life, always to do your things because sooner or later you will need it, it doesn't matter how late or early it is but if you must trained or do something you should do it. This guy has some much passion for the sport that has achievement so many things, not only for his tournaments, instead for being beyond the best tennis player outside a court, respectful, considerate and lovable. Go Rafa! You are unique!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me guessing! I had read a review on the blog \\"thatiswhatsheread\\". I always find her reviews to be spot on.  Excellent book.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|First off. BEFORE you even watch this realize it is in fact a violent, action/martial arts movie.I keep reading the very few negative reviews on this movie and at least half are complaining that it's too violent. That's like watching a porno then getting offended by all the sex. If you want simple ol school action, this is an excellent movie. Sometimes the simplest plots are the best. \\"Foreign S.W.A.T. team raids a secured drug building.\\" You won't see any lovey dovey cute stuff on this one. This is as real as it gets. Showing the bad side of how things really are in this world. Anyways, this isn't much of a review as it is me telling you to watch it if you like action movies. Heed the warning though. It is violent. ENJOY.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book in the trilogy was good. I liked the way the author moved things along without stringing  the plot out. I liked the way the second book added some mystery to it. I was sad to read the last pages.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I just watched the movie 'sugar man' and fell in love with his music. I immediately purchased Cold Fact, and Coming From Reality, and am very happy I did!  His music is unique, and inspiring! I highly recommend both albums!
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC News provides breadth of coverage that other news services do not. This app has seen more of my returns than other similar applications.

B00436GNVC|4.0|I'm not going to write a lengthy review of this album. What I will say is that I don't understand why this album was so universally panned. I thought the entire album had much more personality than what her debut Rockferry had and I actually happened to enjoy this album even more than her first release. I am clearly in the minority but I thought this was actually an improvement. I enjoyed the songwriting better than the debut, loved the contributions by the Roots and Albert Hammond Jr., and enjoyed every song from beginning to end. It's simultaneously more fun and heartfelt as an album.<br /><br />It seems to have a more upbeat and groovy sound that is almost entirely absent from the debut album, but she still doesn't shy away from ballads here. Rockferry was an entirely more classical sounding album but it was not an album I turned to as frequently as this one. While I enjoyed both, I think perhaps this album is simply not going to appeal to the exact same audience as Rockferry because she mixes up her sound on this second outing.<br /><br />At the very least... I think fans who may have passed on hearing this album at all because it was universally panned should at least give it a few listens to decide for themselves. Music (much like any art) is always highly subjective.
B008KOMMTA|5.0|I just went to order and I see that they have the \\"sign up to be notified when this item becomes available\\" note on it. Are they pulling an \\"Avengers: Phase One Collector's Edition\\" on us?
0062206281|4.0|Check out the full review at Kritters Ramblings<br /><br />The third in a sort of series that made me fall even more in love with the characters and the setting of this bookshop in Barcelona.  With repeating characters, this book was easy to get into and even harder to put down - I loved revisiting some of the characters at a different point in their lives and seeing what they were up to at this moment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|no problems after six months.  I like the reading and devotional plans that come with it too.  this is an app you would pay money for if you had to.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as great as Hunger Games or maybe better.  Can't wait to read the next installment.  Movie kept very close to the book .
B00932A2MC|4.0|I rented this one with low expectations.  Turned out to be the perfect movie to crank up the surround sound and eat popcorn to.  Actually ended up liking it quite a bit!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Loved this book.  It was tightly written and witty with a few interesting twists here and there.  The characters were fleshed out.  A real page-turner, that kept me reading well into the night.  So many entertaining novels are poorly written pulp.  Gone Girl was an entertaining well written novel.
B00005A0V0|5.0|I discovered Caravan in my \\"prog rock\\" phase in the mid-1970s, and bought this as a vinyl album on one of my visits to England in 1974 or 1975, if memory serves me right (I grew up in Belgium). Even though Caravan is not strictly a \\"prog rock\\" band per se like, say EL&P, it still captures that era's music vibe quite well.<br /><br />\\"In the Land of Grey & Pink\\" (1971 relase; 5 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with the table-setting \\"Golf Girl\\" where the Sinclair Brothers (Richard and Dave) establish a gently romping sound. \\"Winter Wine\\" is an 8 min. epic track, quite common in those days, but it is for me the only track that does not resonate after all these years. \\"Love to Love You (And Pigs Will Fly Tonight\\" (UK single) is a 3 min. irrevent but fun track, and an obvious single choice. The A side of the original vinyl album closes with the title track, and remains my favorite track on here, an immediately engaging song, and perhaps Caravan's finest moment ever. The B side of the original album is the 23 min. \\"Nine Feet Underground\\", starting immediately with a 5 min. instrumental workout, showcasing all of the band's musical strenghts, none more so than the mellotron (ah! where have the days gone).<br /><br />This is clearly Caravan's best album, period. It is is amazing how well it holds up, now 41 years after its release. I had literally not listened to this album in years, but when recently browsing my 2,000 CD collection, I fell upon this and has an immediate urge to play it. It still sounds fabulous, and clrealy stands the test of time. \\"In the Land of Grey of Pink\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I am 13 years old and in 7th grade. This is by far the greatest, most enjoyable book I have ever read. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone because this book was fantastic. This is why I read.
0670022411|4.0|The Discovery of Withches grabs you from the very beginning!  Deborah Harness is able to immerse you into her world of witches, vampires and daemons. All of the  in the book have such great develop and contact with the center character,Diana, that is easy to believe this world exists.  Such that path of poor Diana is laced with possible harm, she yet rises and shows commitment to her belief on what she should do with herself. At all turns she is so honestly great in her pursuit and frustration in pursuit of the Ashmole 782. Such the great development of romance and humor incites your will to quickly read the next page!  I highly recommend this great read![[ASIN:0143119680 A Discovery of Witches: A Novel (All Souls Trilogy)]]
B00005JKJA|3.0|I saw you holding this movie in your hand. Your dress was the color of scarlet...<br /><br />You let the DVD case fall to the floor. I picked it up...<br /><br />Someone whispered in another room, \\"Is he here yet?\\"<br /><br />I said \\"No, sir, I am not.\\" But they couldnt hear.<br /><br />Whose glove is that? It lays crumpled on the mattress.<br /><br />The same mattress we made love on, but only once.<br /><br />'Am I going to recognize you, then, when the time comes?'<br /><br />I dont know, perhaps you will. But take this, my review of Mulholland Drive.<br /><br />It may or may not bring you luck.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'd recommend this book for high school readers and above.  It isn't too complicated or too deep.  However the gory scenes, deaths and themes may be a bit much for younger readers. I am one of those who saw the movie before reading the book.  The movie and the book were very close.  I thought the riveting storyline about a post-apocalyptic North America sectored into districts under a ruthless, indulgent Capital, a deadly arena and a strong emotionally unbalanced (with good reason) heroine showed great potential.  I ended up reading all three books in a week.  I was totally drawn into their world by each turn of unpredictable events.  The author, Suzanne Collins knows how to place cliff hangers and surprised at the end of each chapter that makes you want to hurry to the next!  At times, I became increasingly frustrated with the main character by the second book.  This may have been by design.  She is truly a case study for Post-traumatic Stress Disorders.  Thankfully, the other damaged supporting characters helped to carry the story.  I think the Hunger Game series could spinoff into gold mine if we could explore what was happening with other characters in other districts, or learn more about what lead up to the \\"dark years.\\"  I highly recommend this book and the series.  It made me love my Kindle Fire even more!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|sometimes it turns your brain into a mushy noodle..... but such fun and very addictive.  love it and can't stop playing.
0345803485|1.0|Cant believe I fell for the hype.  Characters are dumb; Plot is dumb; Writing is bad.  I'm embarrassed to say I read it.  I stopped 2/3 the way through.
B006LSZECO|2.0|First, the writing was very weak.  Author kept using paranthetical asides to either explain a reference or add a second thought of the character.  Really annoying.  Second, characters were very shallow and lacked development, none were likable.  Third, it was supposed to a mystery, but police portrayed as dim witted and there was very little suspense or clues to challenge the reader. Finally, the ending was completely unsatisfying when there were so many alternatives that the writer could have pursued.  Took it on a vacation.  If it wasn't on my Kindle, I would have left it at the hotel.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Having the Kindle app on my Droid Global and Kindle Fire means I can read 2 different books or the same one because they sync to where I have read. No book marks falling put of my books or grandkids playing--- doggy bone with my bookmark.  To much fun!!!!  Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!
0345803485|5.0|Soooo good!!! Nothing got done around my house because I couldn't put the book down!! Def a must read!! Loved it!
B007TML4EI|4.0|I am enjoying the game - when working it plays well on my kindle. it definately challenges my thinking and is amusing to see the dummy get crushed, blown up, etc. it does freeze up from time to time, I get a black screen half the time when starting it - I had to force shut down my kindle at one point as there was no picture / no response. because of this I will not be leaving it on my kindle as I don't like dealing with games that cause my device to do &quot;weird &quot; things.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I got this game because of the internet TV show all about android. Eileen Rivera host of the show profiles it in there arena segment. On a hunch I got  the the app. It is a ok game I have played this type of game too much. I liked it but not enouph to keep playing it. My son was playing the game and went to the stash and run up coins on both tablet and phone. shame on me for not protecting my self from stupidity. My Sone loves the game.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this app. I use it for all my notes in class. I love the tags and pics and all that. It makes organization so much eaisier I used inkpad for a while but decided to try this on a whim. Good bye inkpad!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have had no issues with Pinterest at all. I love it and have enjoyed it a lot on my Kindle Fire and use it more than on my PC.
B007RAJVR4|5.0|This album is very much about the simple ways we all love one another, all different types of love in our lives. Musically it is rich and refreshing. If you liked \\"We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.\\" you will definitely like This album
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I read this book on my Kindle and thought it was very enjoyable.  It had a lot of excitement and kept you on your toes.  It was a bit hard to see the pictures and hand written letters on the Kindle.
B008602KQI|1.0|I go to the movies to watch a movie.  I pay for the privilege.  II buy a DVD for a great movie.  What do I get?  Ads, advertising!<br />Please!  I watch network TV, I expect advertising.  I pay for cable TV, movies in the theater, movies on DVD; and I don't want to sit thru ads.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you are like me and most others, then read the prologue and then jump to chapter 9. I did not miss anything substantial. I was looking for training, deployment and execution of the operation and that starts from chapter 9 (but do the read the prologue to let it reel you in). And if you want to just jump to the main day's beginning, then jump to chapter 12 - chapts 9-11 covers more of the training and planning stuff.<br /><br />Unlike many critics who did not find the writing to be good, I thought it was very well written with very minor issues that would be expected of a first-time author (even though he's had an editor but still this isn't Tom Clancy writing his 35th action novel or Stephen Kind writing his 100th). The very minor issues never distracted me, since most of the time I was able to picture clearly what the author was going through in real human terms.<br /><br />Since I purchased the Kindle edition, I did not know that several illustrations of the Osama raid were at the end of the book. For physical book owners, many might flip to the end just out of curiosity and would have known about these illustrations. If I'd known, I'd have referred to them while reading (although reading the text was good enough but the illustrations would have given an even better mental picture as I read).
0345803507|4.0|Well as I've said in my last two reviews the writing in theses books are great.  The love story between Christian and Ana leave you wanting for more.  Ana helps Christian to be the loving man and father he thought he could never be. As I've stated in the other reviews I did not agree with or like the BDSM relationship between these two in the book.  I don't know how anyone can find this behavior acceptable or enjoyable.  Overall its a great love story, but its not one I would read again.
B006OAB432|5.0|fun. has a way to rewind back to the old queen/elton john albums yet slap you in the face with the indie pop of nowadays.  they don't disappoint.
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  The characters are rich, and the story flows well.  I can't wait for the next book in this series.  You'll love Gideon Cross as much as Christian Gray.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of those programs that you cannot seem to get enough. The series provides both an insight to the life in the early 1900's in England with all the social and economic culture exposed, but you get a glimpse of history and how events shaped lives.  I can't wait to see the third season.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Before the Cloud, I would have to buy the CD, rip the songs, and then try and put them on each device by connecting that device to my computer, and almost always have to install updated drivers or update iTunes each time. No longer do I have to do that. Now I am using Amazon's Cloud for my media. Amazon is doing a fantastic job. I can buy music on Amazon's web site (I love the $5 dollar album sales), have it added to the Cloud, and download for playing on my different devices. Amazon simplifies sharing my music purchases on my wifes devices also.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|Charlize was excellent as always.  Unfortunately, Kristen Stewart only has one facial expression - if you put the sound on mute while Kristen is on screen you will be unable to distinguish the happy screens from the sad scenes because her expression NEVER changes.<br /><br />Watch this movie to see Charlize's performance and the great scenery.
B008MEM24S|5.0|where's. my Perry. is the best game ever it is better then where's. my water I am still looking for the hiden duck it is going to be great I just know it you got to play this.
B008D28HYS|3.0|This game is kinda fun, but didn't really grab and hold my attention. I gave it 3 stars because its not as addicting as other puzzle games, and after just a few minutes, I found myself wanting to play another game. I got it for free, and I wouldn't pay for it.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Challenging but it tests your brain. The outcome is amazing, wish there were more games like this. Would like a more simple version for my daughter to play.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|amazing app and I would reccomend it cuz you never know how charged your battery is. and it tells you how much time you have left. plus its helpful on long car rides. so yeah get it. plus its free so no brainerr.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Do yourself a favor and do NOT download any games from this developer! They have Provence greedy, untrustworthy &amp; unreliable to one &amp; all far too many times!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|better than the original. I love how it makes farmville so obsolete.<br />cant wait to show everyone who played the original Pc game<br /><br />:)))))
B007SGM084|5.0|It was so compelling I couldn't put it down until it was over. The story alone was worth the read.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Was mildly entertained by the first two films. The third installment I really enjoyed. It seemed more organized then the first two (or maybe by the third movie I was adjusted to the visuals). Really entertaining.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The book was better. Wish the director had the main character narrate her emotions. The reasons why the hunger games were in place were rushed and not fully explained
B0090EIILU|2.0|I enjoyed Ali G, Borat, and Bruno.<br /><br />In this movie Cohen goes away from shocking real people with his character and creates a completely fictional movie. It's not very good. I got bored after 30 min because I realized I had only laughed once/twice and didn't care to finish the movie.<br /><br />Cohen needs to get back to his genuine characters and duping real people. He's great at it. This stuff, not so much.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|it is soo good when ever I want to see a video I go straight here no where else no enternet nothing here!
B007TML4EI|5.0|This app workedcgreat on my Kindle Fire.  The husband and kids were putting in their input to save Melvin.  Great physics based game for all ages.
B000ID1J5E|5.0|Great movie, action packed, have seen before and wanted a copy. The movie was very entertaining and gave away just information to keep you in suspense, letting you rest ocassionally before more suspense.  A movie you can watch more than one time.
B00846REIS|4.0|Very good book.If you have read the 50 Shades of Grey series then you will enjoy this book as well.
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|I've been a Testament fan for over 20 years and they continue to produce timeless albums. One of the best releases of the year.
0670023329|4.0|This is a harrowing story of a Shin, a North Korean who was born in a brutal labor camp. It is a fascinating story told by the author which is mostly based on his interviews with Shin. Given North Korea's closed society, the author could not for sure confirm Shin's story. He also peppers the story with some facts about life in North Korea and refugees who have managed to escape.<br /><br />I thought that Harden, a journalist, could have done more to delve deeper into Shin's story and psyche. For example, Shin spent about a year in China before finding his way to South Korea. He did odd jobs and at some point lived on a farm. I wished that the author had interviewed the farmer who housed Shin. At another point Shin got a job in a restaurant in China. The author implies that Shin had to quit the job after eleven days because he hated the work so much. This was interesting given Shin's work conditions in Camp 14. What did he find so repulsive about the job? It certainly would have required delving deeper into his psychology to understand his actions, but that would have made the book richer and deeper. Jon Krakauer, an outstanding author and journalist, usually does an great job in trying to understand the psychology of his subjects. He did it well in both \\"Where Men Win Glory\\" and \\"Into the Wild\\".  In all fairness Harden did touch on the fact that most North Koreans cannot adjust to life in the West or South Korea once they escape.<br /><br />I am grateful that the author brought this story to the world's attention. For those more interested in life in North Korea, I also recommend Barbara Demick's \\"Nothing to Envy\\".
B008BM9L72|5.0|Very sad I'm finished these books I'm reading them again, would love to read Christians side tho think if would be a great read
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Really nice product ... easy to use and plenty of information related to your battery use. I use it on my Android tablet.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Brilliant book couldn't stop reading it can not wait for the second one to come out on 2nd of oct ...
0060882611|5.0|I had to buy this book for a literature class but I had read it many times over the years when I was younger. It is always a good book and the one I got was harcover and in great shape!
B008602KQI|5.0|We really enjoy watching this movie - it is so engaging?!!My kids beg to watch it all the time! We like how it MOSTLY follows the book.
B008XG1X18|4.0|makes browsing way easier on my kindle! but why do I have to have a &quot;20word minimum&quot; to review? I give the review process 1 star :/
B008D28HYS|5.0|an excellent game, time passed by quickly while playing this and need lots of concentration. i highly recommend this game!!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|An amazing movie that provides a hypothetical insight to what extremes the world might go to to provide violence and entertainment to appease the public.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|A bittersweet read. This book was very interesting, keeps you wanting to read. I would recommend this book. Good clean book.And enjoyed the second one that follows.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is a great investment and really helps me fall asleep. I had the free version for a while and recently upgraded to the premium version. It's wonderful and I love it!
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Great buy!  Started listening to Fun after seeing them on Colbert Report, they are a great fusion of alternative rock and an 80's sound.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|I'm impressed by how well this book has aged in the years since I first read it. It is still a must-have, must-read, must-follow book for anyone serious about working in the software field.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a great game for those who love the draw by numbers or \\"pic-cross\\" style of game.  There are no advertisements, doesn't seem to be any 'funny' background processes, didn't ask for any strange permissions, a very large selection of levels/pictures, and the controls are intuitive.  The only negative thing I have to say and I had to dig to come up with:  I would have let the user have a bit more freedom with the zoom/center feature.  When working on the larger levels, you have to zoom in, and I would like to zoom and then pan the image to where ever I want vice zooming and then the screen auto re-centering.  For version 2.0 I'd say add an option to change the base colors, there were a few levels that used different shades of gray for colors and it was sometimes a touch difficult to see which color/shade you were supposed to use.  You might also want to allow the user to move where the color selection bar goes via the control panel or something, it occasionally got in the way.  In the end, my complaints are superficial, the game is good, you should download it if you like this style of game.
B007TML4EI|5.0|So far the game works flawlessly on my Kindle. This is done extremely well and is very fun to play. I like how smooth the controls are. A feature that may be nice would be &quot;slow motion&quot;. I am strongly motivated to check out other games by this development team.
B00846REIS|5.0|Better than 50 Shades. Real to life  and much more steamy! ending kept my wanting more!<br />Can't wait till the next one comes out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a terrific book! Original, creatively written. A major page-turner. Found it hard to put down after getting through first 50 pages. Chilling, psychological intrigue.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|This is the classic. The one that all the guys talk about. Any guy that has ever been incarcerated, any guy that has a menial job or an over bearing employer knows this movie. \\"I'm shaking the bush boss\\". My wife and I were around a table with several friends doing a task when that line from the movie came up and my wife didn't know what we were talking about. So that is why I rented it for the umpteenth time. [[ASIN:B001EC2IXK Cool Hand Luke.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Completely enthralled by this game played the whole campaign. Multilayer is a little difficult but good .  Besides that very balanced and interesting.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I've tried lots of jigsaw apps and this one is the best so far!  Actual jigsaw pieces, not just squares.  Optional sizes and rotation make for a variety of levels.  Beautiful pictures and even relaxing music!  The initial app is free along with 3 additional puzzle packs.  Additional packs available for purchase.
B004529NKC|5.0|This is my favorite one of the step up movies ...the music is fresh and the dancing is off the hook ..every time I watch it I am inspired to get up and just start dancing ...I would recomend the whole series to anyone but this is my favorite ..hope you learn some cool dance moves ..I did!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it helps me when I'm wondering how much battery I have left for certain things like music, apps, browsing, and making calls
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Pretty well executed. I'd like to see a level editor and a legthened campaign mode.  Larger area maps would also be nice.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|We loved this movie and would watch again. Very entertaining kind of like a star wars movie, the name does nothing to reveal what the movie is about. Lots of action, Recomend
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This product contained all the movies in widescreen format without bonus discs. That is exactly what we were looking for.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|We watched this movie on Amazon and enjoyed the story line. Acting was good. I will watch the others when they come out.
B008IZ62IS|5.0|This is a GREAT addictive show. But you gotta watch it from Season 1 because of the development and storyline of the characters
B008S4YZCO|5.0|super fun game...love it its great for ages ten and up you care for cute monsters which need constant care. awesome game will reccomend to everyone
B005TMSN4E|5.0|I use this on my Nikon N1 V1 body to use a Nikkor AF 50-300mm lens.  Easy to use and works great!
B004FHP9KA|5.0|Loved this movie from begging to end. Had me going and thinking throughout the entire movie. Would recommend it to everyone to see. It is also a must watch movie.
B007K3KO74|5.0|That's a gr8 album. Better than the previous one (Hardy candy). Not the best but it doesn't dissapoint who listens to it.
B0088WGBC8|5.0|Just loved this movie from begging to end. Loved it so much that I had to watch it twice and told my friends and co-workers about how good this movie really is. It is a must watch movie for everyone that loves action movies.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Inspired by the pre-existing song of the same title, the movie Singin' In the Rain builds that slim idea into one of Hollywood's greatest musicals, and indeed one of its finest films of any genre. The 2002 DVD was of remarkably high quality, and I was eager to see the difference made by a high-definition restoration. As expected, the new transcription is significantly improved in picture quality, and the sound is glorious.<br /><br />The talent and energy of the lead trio of Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds make this film a delight from end to end. It sails by with only a slight pause during the Broadway Melody segment, which contains some relatively slow dance sequences with the lovely Cyd Charisse. During the performance of the title song Signin' In the Rain, watch for Kelly's hand-off of the umbrella to a passing gentleman. That is Snub Pollard, the comedian star of many silent films.<br /><br />The story is centered on the traumatic change from silent films to \\"talkies\\" in 1927-28. Hard as it might be to imagine now, that change had occurred less than 25 years before this film was made. Al Jolson's The Jazz Singer had precipitated a real crisis in Hollywood, and this is an all-singing, all-dancing comedic look at the transition. Some stars rose, some fell, and one character in this story faked it and clung to stardom by appropriating someone else's voice. Special mention should be made of Jean Hagen, who had to disguise her fine voice by affecting a whiney screech that could scratch glass.<br /><br />Kelly had the physical prowess to perform virtually all of his stunts in the film, but was not permitted to do so due to the risk to the production in case he was injured. Therefore he had a stunt double for some scenes such as the leap from the trolley into the car driven by Miss Reynolds.<br /><br />For a nearly perfect experience of the magic of Hollywood, it would be hard to find a better example than Singin' In the Rain on Blu-ray.
B007SGM084|5.0|Could not put it down until I read it all. Loved the every bit.  Always kept you guessing until the end.  A very well written book.
B001NPDCFQ|5.0|Idealized even beyond its source material, Meet Me in St. Louis is director Vincente Minnelli's pitch-perfect 1944 evocation of a world that likely never existed, although we wish it did.  St. Louis, Missouri in 1903, just before the World's Fair of 1904, is the setting for this story.  It is an episodic account of a year in the life of the Smith family, with beautifully crafted vignettes such as the ice wagon, the boy next door, the Halloween tricks without treats, and the trolley ride.  Judy Garland is at her youthful best, before the struggle controlling her weight began to affect her health. In an ensemble cast with no major focal point other than Miss Garland, it was Margaret O'Brien as five-year-old \\"Tootie\\" who stole every scene she was in.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of this classic is wonderfully sharp and clean, with great sound. It has a variety of special features, including a 1930 Vitaphone production entitled \\"Bubbles\\" which features Judy at the age of eight as one of the three Gumm Sisters.  This is only three years into the sound era, and we hear Judy sing a brief solo.<br /><br />Meet Me In St. Louis is now considered to be an American classic. If you can remember with fondness a better time, a time long ago, you will probably enjoy spending a couple of hours with the Smiths of St. Louis. And if you are young, and cannot remember such a time, here is your chance to see what it might have been like.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I typically do not bother writing reviews of my purchases.  I wanted to create one this time since there is so much contiversy surrounding this book.  The book was very well written and a great read.  As for wheater or not it should have been written is between this operator and his fellow seals not for us in the civilian world to decide.  Lastly God bless all of our soldiers that go out into harms way so that we can stay safe in the background and live our lives with a sense of normalcy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app! I'm a pinterest addict (of sorts) and being able to use it so easily on my kindle is wonderful! I fully recommend it!
B0084AXZK0|2.0|I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.<br /><br />How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.<br /><br />But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.<br /><br />And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.<br /><br />Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.

034580404X|4.0|I heard so much about the trilogy from friends and co - workers.  Being an avid reader and a practitioner/participant of BdSm, I had to order it.  I did, and enjoyed it, then loaned it to a friend, who paid me for it so I could order another set because she wore out the original.<br />While I found it not true to life for the seriously BdSm'ers, it was very enjoyable and titillating...exactly what it was billed as...erotic romance.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Very interesting read[[ASIN:B004LROUNG The Litigators]]. It was the first book I downloaded for my new Kindle and it was  quite a reading experience. The book is fast paced.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Easy learning curve and very addictive.  I haven't fired up the original cross me since getting this one!  Definitely recommend.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest!! They are always updating new things and there is so much to look it! The only problem so far is that it wont attach pictures to facebook.
0670022411|5.0|Anne Rice meets Diana Gabaldon. This book was fantastic, I could not put it down. I missed the characters for a couple of weeks when I was done with it.<br />As good as the first one was, the second book in the series (just came out, Shadow of Night) is better.<br />This series is on my list of favorites now.
1933952806|5.0|This is a great book, especially for new DSLR owners like me.  The author does a great job breaking down every feature and setting.  He shows exactly where to navigate through the menus to get to what you're looking for.  My favorite feature in the book is the \\"My Recommendation\\" paragraph at the end of each section.  He shares his thoughts on how to get the most out of the camera.<br />Bottom line:  The decision isn't if this book is worth getting, it is.  The question is paperback or kindle version.  I sprung for the paperback.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is really fun!!! I recommend for everyone who is considering to buy this (even though its free) buy it!!! It is good for just something to do, and a brain teaser. there are a lot of levels and I enjoy this game. get it!!! &hearts;
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I like the recording artist and the songs that are recorded on this album.  The songs and the music is good.  I do not want to date myself, the music or the songs or sound partial but good music is always liked.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|great computer animation! some of the best 3d effects yet on my 73\\" tv good story, & easy to follow. Sam Worthington is as good in this as he was in avitar.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This game is not without its flaws, mainly little gripes about the damage from specific characters versus other specific characters. If you play it you will understand after completing the campaign. That having been said though, the game is quite fun for at least one play through and is well done overall, no reason not to merit a 5 star! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great read. It is a bit violent and lots of people die but it still would be a good read for anyone over age 14. The heroine is very believable and likeable. I really enjoyed the fact that there was no swearing and no sex.
B004UC4HCG|1.0|This is the third Shuttle system that I've built. I've used Shuttle computers exclusively as a primary desktop PC for approximately the last 10 years. They are quiet. They are compact. The first two machines gave me 4 to 5 years of reliable use.<br />Unfortunately the latest build, the SH67H3, started experiencing BIOS problems after the first 6 months. Today, less than 9 months after purchasing, the motherboard gave out with no warning. The machine no longer boots to BIOS, and now I'm forced to purchase a new motherboard, case, and power supply. Needless to say, I am no longer purchasing Shuttle products.
B0012EJVTY|5.0|\\"MIJ\\" is not only Deep Purple's finest moment, it is one of rock's finest moments. This has a 50's cover, plus DP's best live songs all on one double disc set. Live, raw, smart rock n' roll that boils with tension and energy. Led Zeppelin, for all their bluster, never sounded this hot and this together on a live recording. DP was the world's best live rock band in 1972, and they prove it beyond all doubt here. Don't pass this up.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|This movie is a gem. New, yet classic. Definitely timeless. Now, this is a silent film so one must be patient. Dialogue is barely used nor is it necessary. The whole story, every emotion, is communicated to the audience through the actions and gestures of the actors. It is like watching an actual moving painting. How movies were intended to be. It all comes together beautifully. Best love story of the year, probably the past couple of years.<br />However, if you have no patience, you need things to happen fast as many people do today. You may not find this movie pleasant. You'll probably find it boring and dragging. Just a warning. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Some will wait and consume the whole work before judging and reacting to it. Others will lose interest within 10 minutes if nothing big happens and condemn the whole thing. Patience is a virtue and this movie is definitely worth the wait!
1596354208|4.0|This book has a good variety of projects.  Some appear to be lengthy and others fairly quick and easy.  I have never tried tatting and I would not recommend this book for a beginner relying soley on the printed instructions.  I would advise anyone who wishes to learn tatting to order a book with a dvd to demonstrate the exact movements of the shuttle. If I had not purchased a dvd I think I would quickly have given tatting up.
034580404X|5.0|It was different than other books that I have read. Lots of spice and a solid story line to back it. Loved it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a must read for those who believe that our Armed Forces are here to protect us and others no matter what.  This book is just one acoount of the many brave heroes in our Armed Services that went and go through He-- for defending others as well as themselves for our freedom.
B007TML4EI|4.0|It's pretty obvious that a lot of the 5-star reviews are posted by the developer (or at least friends/family of the developer). Which is sad, because the game actually has a lot going for it.<br /><br />First, for the privacy-conscious, the app has very minimal permissions--internet access to access leaderboards.<br /><br />Second, if you have never played this type of game before, the tutorial is very well designed. It's better than some professional tutorials I've seen.<br /><br />And third, it seems to run pretty well even on my weak little Samsung Gravity SMART.<br /><br />As FAOTDs go, it's worth checking out.
B000XA1GDM|5.0|This review is not just for this particular episode. It's for the series itself. I love the humor and the actors. Not too many TV sitcoms appeal to me, but this one does. Though it portrays a younger generation of misfits, I think it's timeless.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|this show rocks!!! my friends and i get together and watch it. lots of blood and gore great story line super excited to watch war of the dammed in january!!!
030758836X|4.0|I got just what I was looking for from this novel.  It has great character development, and the author does a splendid job of thinking you are beginning to get an understanding of what is going on, and then succeeds at making you completely question it!  I'd highly recommend Gone Girl to anyone looking for a good, twisted story, that keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|this show rocks!!! my friends and i get together and watch it. lots of blood and gore great story line super excited to watch war of the dammed in january!!!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I love this app, I have stored my favorite sounds - thunder, rain & thunder. I swear I fall asleep so much faster than w/o the app. My kids also love just hearing all the different sounds
B008IJTFYW|1.0|I don't know where the developers live where they get rain like this, but it's like nothing I ever heard. Maybe they just turned on the sink and said, \\"oh, that's water\\". It definitely was NOT recorded in the rain.

B0088TG252|2.0|I found Safe House to be a cumbersome and predictable spy thriller.<br /><br />The pacing is best described as bipolar, going from hectic action to glacial monotony like someone was flipping a coin to decide how a shot should be paced. I am sure someone thought the slower parts were supposed to build tension; except they don't. Mostly because the movie telegraphs all of it's moves like it's painting by numbers. It's not that the script is really, really bad, I just feel like it's trying to be way more sophisticated than it actually is. You get the distinct impression that they really want to surprise you, but the only way you could be surprised is if you slept through the middle of the movie, which is entirely plausible as there will certainly be times when you will get bored.<br /><br />The acting isn't bad, but at no point is it amazing. Reynolds certainly delivers as the in over his head CIA drone, but sadly Denzel seems to be partially phoning it in. Denzel's character is supposed to be some kind genius rouge super spy, but at no point in the movie are you getting that OMG he IS Keyser Soze and Jason Bourne moment. I kept hoping everything happening in the movie was just in Matt's(reynolds) head because Frost(Denzel) has him on a Machiavellian mental lock down, but the script never really explores this. When they bring Frost in for interrogation, I was thinking he would start controlling everyone like Christopher Walken's performance in Suicide Kings.<br /><br />According to this movie the very first thing they do in a clandestine CIA interrogation is water-board you, and maybe they do. Except in this movie the whole scene is so out of place you can't help but think they originally had a completely different scene written, but water-boarding was all over the cable news networks in 2011 so we gotta have a scene where someone gets water-boarded, because water-boarding. To highlight how baffling and out of place this one scene is, in the run up to the actual torture itself Frost is making cracks about the thread count of the towels \\"you gotta have the 600s\\" this is supposed to tells us that Frost is really running the show with Denzel's signature sly knowing grin as a wink to the audience. The sequence just felt plainly shoehorned into the script, where as I feel a scene with some \\"acting\\" and \\"dialogue\\" might have had a better impact on the overall story. The whole scene could have been filled with sinister tension instead of just a wet, disheveled and gasping Denzel and confused looking puppy dog Reynolds. Also Denzel's character Frost is like spy famous with people recognizing him on sight like he is some kind of celebrity that all the junior spies collect trading cards of when they go to spy school. In fact in a cut scene to Langley CIA HQ several \\"analysts\\" give a seamless rundown of how dangerous Frost is in an interrupting and finishing each others sentences kind of way, it left my head spinning with the improbabilities.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was all the car accidents. On one hand, thank the gods of cinema that the director didn't blow up everything in sight, like some unbearable hacks(Michael Bay as an example) who think that anytime two cars collide one must flip over, blow up or turn into a robot. The problem is that both the protagonists and the antagonists are in so many violent collisions throughout the movie with not a seatbelt or airbag in sight. Sure they get some cuts and bruises but seriously a few of the collisions should have resulted in death(due to lack of treatment) if not a major concussion or broken limbs. Yet the plot keeps reaching for the car crash as a mechanism to change the arc of the action, instead it runs over your suspension of disbelief like a hit and run victim.<br /><br />Also Reynold's character has nearly magic super powers of reasoning and observation that are downright preposterous. He uses his super powers only when the writer runs out of talent and has written himself into a box with no other way out. I can think of three examples in the movie that would probably impress Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />A question that keeps coming up in the film is why Frost is in South Africa, Matt keeps asking it like any answer Frost gives him might actually be true or relevant. Nearly every character in the film asks this same question, like it's some kind of talisman and that if they keep asking it, the whole story will eventually start making sense. The writer's hope is that the audience will think that there is something important in the question and divert the viewer's attention from the MacGuffin that clumsily holds the story together. The whole situation is very funny as the audience already knows the answer to the question and was blatantly shown the MacGuffin in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Oh and yes, the whole plot is held up by nothing bigger or better than a classic and trope laden \\"Macguffin chip\\", and for three fourths of the movie only the audience and one character actually know what it is.<br /><br />There is also a kind of \\"romance\\" that is barely a subplot, that is literally all I can say about it. The romance was on the screen just enough for you to notice it, provide a touch of character background and motivation and really nothing else.<br /><br />If your cool with watching Denzel Washington get repeatedly handcuffed to random objects and Ryan reynolds get beaten up over and over, then you are going to love this movie. Otherwise wait until you can watch it for free and save your $2.99 for a better film like Ronin or Spy Game if you want a taught espionage thriller.
B008NEMPTO|1.0|Offensively horrible dialogue, mediocre acting, pathetically laughable special effects. At one point two of the main characters literally were \\"fighting\\" on foot, standing ON TOP OF A STAMPEDE, jumping from horseback to horseback; the entire scene being 100% CGI with unbelievably terrible graphics and \\"camera\\" movement and rendering quality.  No aspect was enjoyable in the least, entire project was just unbearable. I've seen dozens of vampire movies, and am a fan of the genre, the title sounds infinitely more interesting than the finished product, which felt like an uneducated teenager tried to analogize the Confederates with vampires.  As if it were a new concept, there were even \\"slavery is bad\\" motifs.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is great. Unlike most games where it gets harder and harder tip its almost impossible to complete any mission, this games only gets to a point where the levels r challenging but do able then you get a special badge then start all over again for another special badge. Very addictting.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I discovered the Walt Longmire books after watching the TV show. I loved the show and when it ended I had to have more. So I started reading the books and I love them too. The characters and relationships are slightly different--you will miss Branch--but the essential ones: Henry Standing Bear, Ruby, and daughter Cady are the same. Vic is a little different but recognizable. The plot in this book is familiar from one of the episodes, but there's an awesome addition concerning the Cheyenne that really hooked me.
B007BVOF8E|2.0|This movie was INCREDIBLY confusing and tiring to watch.  I continued to try and understand what was going on; and at the end of the movie... was still pretty lost.  If you are looking for an \\"easy\\" watch - this is not your movie choice.  Be prepared to really pull together a fast-paced puzzle.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very exciting, mind blowing, romantic, lots of humor, dangerous, on the edge of my seat, lots of imagination, tear jerking, excellent book.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This program is used to keep track of information sinc I move between 2 or 3 comuters each day. The App makes it even easier to look up info when I'm not at my PC. Using a Kindle Fire for this App has a small drawback in that it needs internet access to run, which is not a problem most of the time. However there have been an occasion where I was out and needed to get a quick note that I had made earlier and it would not open without wi-fi.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its a fun game.  don't like that. you have to buy credits if you wish to really get far (I don't buy anything) .  its still enjoyable!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Wonderful characters are what makes this book.  The personalties drew you in.  There was so much tragedy in their lives, it was amazing how they could go on, and some of them didn't.  It was a fascinating story of a terrible time in this country, when people owned people.  It is a book about humanity, good and bad.

B008FOB124|5.0|I've read some really odd reviews here, saying it's \\"too electronic\\" or that Lisa's presence isn't felt \\"enough,\\" or that Brendan's lyrics can leave something to be desired. As a longtime, 20+ year listener, all I need is that signature depth of emotion that the duo's always had an uncanny knack for, ever since their debut album close to some 30 years ago at this point. My concern, is that a ton of folks started listening to DCD after \\"Spiritchaser,\\" after they'd seemingly forever parted ways and gone off on their solo recording careers. Of course, Lisa's been the more prolific of the two, and through all those soundtracks, found DCD a whole new listening audience, who wasn't there to revel in the majesty of the late '80s 4AD years. Even those who latched onto the band due to \\"Labyrinth,\\" may not realize just how ahead of their time records like \\"Serpent's Egg\\" were, or the world mix that was \\"Aion,\\" which actually alienates my ears to this very day. Luckily for me, I feel this new album, whilst not necessarily a culmination nor celebration of all things in DCD's past, is simply a nice record to listen to, with some amazing songs to add to their already great canon. I've no complaints, just welcome heartily back a duo who haven't made a record together in some 15 years. Geezus, it's 2012, and it's a really nice record (even if the artwork's just not the same as 23 Envelope's was).
B0085KGHI6|5.0|What an amazing historic event and we didn't have to miss seeing it just because we were not there. Keith Richards and Mick Jagger began to hang out musically as teens because of some newly bought records of Mick that included \\"Best of Muddy Waters\\"  and other iconic american blues guitarists that Keith desperately wanted to listen to. This Blues music brought them together and infused and inspired all of their early songs. Muddy Waters also influenced their name as it came from a song on an oft-played vinyl laying on the floor of their studio. They both idolized and revered Muddy Waters and blues men like Buddy Guy and Junior Wells. And in this video, they are all on stage together!!<br />Better yet, on stage at one time (and its a tiny stage) are Keith Richards (#4 Greatest Guitarist of all Time -- Rolling Stone Magazine); Buddy Guy (#23 Greatest Guitarist RS) and Muddy Waters (#49 RS) + Ronnie Wood (who regrettably is not on that list)...<br />I personally can't think of a better use of 20 bucks (or less?) for anyone who loves the Stones, the Blues or guitar music or music history. [[ASIN:B0085KGHI6 Muddy Waters & The Rolling Stones Live At The Checkerboard Lounge, Chicago 1981 DVD/CD]]
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Superior acting and scripts and amazing character development.No gimmicks, no special effects, just solid story telling about a man's descent into a hell of his own making.

0062068415|2.0|The beginning of this book is profoundly boring.  It's simply the worst opening chapter I've ever read, bar none.  The setting is drab, and even the characters are bleak.  The entire chapter is about a dead father who was disappointed in our main character, a dead wife and vomiting from seasickness.  Total score! I've read 4 chapters and already figured out most of the plot.  A creepy doctor is running a prison for the criminally insane on a remote island.  Gee, what could they possibly be doing there?  Playing scrabble? Also, both marshals have serious mental issues before they arrive, so what possibly could go wrong? If you've ever seen a Boris Karloff movie, you can figure it out as well. Nothing fresh or exciting here.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love these books..I cannot wait until they come out with the movie..I wish the author would create more I these books.

B001OGWY1W|5.0|This movie is very inspiring, the character of the Joker is interesting in the fact that he makes a valid point about the society of Gotham City and how they will hate Batman unless he \\"dies a hero\\", referencing Harvey Dent.  Very interesting to see the clash of morals between Batman and the Joker.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|It is a well written book, it feels like providing a frugal explanation why it is normal to be ordinary, that you should be blessed by a series of conjunctions and factors to be an outlier, which is fine in some sense, however the good flow of the text brings more joy to this book. So I Recommend it for both reasons!
B008XG1X18|4.0|my app freezes up here and there but what app doesn't? love it regardless! I think its easier to work and the layout is very clean.
B0070TRH6O|5.0|This is USEFUL!

0525953728|5.0|I received the book No Easy Day from Amazon yesterday, started reading in the evening and finished it in one sitting. Could not put it down. It is a \\"controversial\\" book because it was not submitted to the Pentagon for approval before publishing. The White House and some Navy brass allege the book reveals operational details that potentially jeopardizes SF personnel in the field. The author used pseudonyms for all the assaulters involved including himself. He is careful to give loads of credit to everyone involved in the operation including other members of Seal Team 6, the fabulous pilots of the 160th Night Stalkers, members of SOF Delta, and even the female CIA analyst he calls Jan who spent years of her life tracking UBL. My impression is that the author had no desire to showboat and his true identity would not have been know had Foxnews not leaked his true identity. Unfortunately it is now widely known. Having read this book and many others by SF operators, there are no shocking revelations regarding operational procedures. None. I suspect the real reason for the hoopla is the dim view the author takes of politicians in general and President Obama is particular. This is no surprise. Most members of the SF community lean to the right politically and generally don't have warm feelings for the red tape, indecisive leadership and political posturing so common in Washington. He gives the President credit for \\"pulling the trigger\\" on the operation and does not use the book to rail. He only mentions these things a few times and mostly sticks with the narrative which is fast paced and captivating if you are into such things. So here's the thing... if the President releases details about the raid, if Navy and JSOC brass share details of the raid then why can't a guy who was boots in the compound tell us what really happened? He waited until he was out of the SEALS to write the book and he used a lot of discretion in sharing details. So who says a man who put his life on the line over and over again during his 10+ years conducting operations on behalf of his country has to surrender his First Amendment Rights to free speech. I thought that was what a democracy was all about. When did we Americans become so keen to give the government the right to spin the details of our unfolding history? Buy the book - the author is donating much of the proceeds to support families of fallen SEALS - and draw your own conclusions. (If you read the book, (and not merely \\"about\\" the book) please feel free to share your impressions.) Meanwhile there are reports that there may be legal action taken against this patriot by the government. I say the author is an American hero and deserves the respect of his leaders rather than derision for sharing his experiences. Wake up America - we are surrendering more and more of our rights in the name of \\"security.\\" While I don't doubt, in a technical sense, there was an infraction, I suspect he would argue Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) would not be a practical issue since the general events and information in the book were in the open and have been hashed from numerous sides and by numerous officials. Funny that the president and the Navy brass and head of JSOC can talk about the raid but a SEAL who was there cannot. Typical double standard and typical attempt to control information and silence those who confuse the rhetoric and propaganda by injecting the facts into the swirl.the line over and over again during his 10+ years conducting operations on behalf of his country has to surrender his First Amendment Rights to free speech.

Funny that the president and the Navy brass and head of JSOC can talk about the raid but a SEAL who was there cannot. Typical double standard and typical attempt to control information and silence those who confuse the rhetoric and propaganda by injecting the facts into the swirl.

0393316041|4.0|He seems to have been such a character that just telling what happened to him in his life makes for more than a novel.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app. it is so easy to pin and repin everything! really easy to use too. great job pintrest!
B005WTR4ZI|2.0|There's a little bit of insight, but writing a book out of this is not honest. Well worth the read, but not the purchase.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I would totally reccomend this for all my friends who have a kindle fire..it has nice controls &amp; machanics..love the weapons and armor
B008BM9L72|1.0|I felt there had been so much hype about this trilogy that it spoilt my expectations some what. I found it more for the very young adult - the way it was written (too much holy this and that) which I found silly. In fact I gave up reading at first due to this. I guess as an older 'Woman of the world' I just found it very tame and childish... sorry
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very addictive and a great way to pass time. Wish you could gain energy a bit faster without having to pay.
098478280X|5.0|This book is well written and I just started to look at it, and I felt it is a great work!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I understand there could possibly be one more book...... I love this series... For a non book reader who could not put the series down... I even resorted to watching the American version  as a last resort...... Clever story...
B000SOSS5W|5.0|Most Artists paint a perfect scene on their canvas while viewing what they visually and physically see in the distance. A true Jazz musician, as an artist, paints the same exact scene but draws the image brilliantly and spontaneously from his/her personal emotions in a burst of momentary self expression. Hancock and Young and the other Jazz musicians in the film exemplify this unique artistic quality - Shelly Dubow
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|The movie was great...unfortunately, we lost the feed briefly twice and when it came back and we clicked \\"Resume\\", it re-started at the beginning and we had to search for where we left off.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The divide presented in this book between the actual even of the killing of Osama Bin Laden and the lives of a Seal advancing to the DevGroup status. Delving into the lives of these men through the eyes of one is moving experience. Vacillating between the pointed attack and the growth through the various training elements is personal and awe inspiring. These men devote a significant portion of their life dealing with issues no human wants to consider. They are put \\"in harms\\" way at the whim of the leaders of our Country to deal with the World's miscreants. We owe a great gratitude to these men presently serving along with those of ages past.  This book left me with the sense that while many are placed in life's challenging situations; the leaders who make those decisions remain in the comfort of their secure abodes. Although OBL was an evil man responsible for the deaths of three thousand on September 11, 2001; his death did not bring an end to the conflict in the area. Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other countries in the Arab Region have not witnessed improved peace but rather greater turmoil. Finally dedicating the books proceeds to charitable groups supports Seals speaks to the inner self of this dedicated group. Thank you Mark Owen, Kevin Maurer
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Wow! Maybe because the Disney logo sits right above the title makes me think that everyone consider this a kid movie which probably led this to be an unpopular movie among adults. I haven't even heard of the movie when it became available for purchase on Amazon. The special effects are top of the line and the story makes me think there can be a sequel. John Carter was a surprise movie for me and its worth watching again, and again. But if you're not into Sci-fi then probably not a good fit for you.
B007SGM084|4.0|This was my first downloded Kindle book.  Very pleased with the ease of obtaining the books and am enjoying having so much reading material in one handy little spot.  Chose 50 Shades as I had heard so much talk about it and recommended by friends.  It is intriging story, tho it becomes a bit predictable and redundant in some areas.  Whereas the story itself could be believable, the amount and frequency of sexual encounters seems unrealistic and improbable. I found myself skimming thru those after a while as it became just repeats of the same words.  Second book for me is more interesting than first, as there is more \\"story\\".  Haven't started third, but looking forward to it.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|Nice to see the entire original cast come back together for one last hooray but didn't really have anything worth watching it again.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|One of the best Stephen King books ever!  This book makes you feel as if you're actually there. Fascinating reading!
B007SGM084|3.0|Into the second book I got tired of all the sex and started skipping pages to the rest of the story to try to find a plot.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app. I'm able to color code my college classes for easy reference on the calendar and I also have my notes in the same place so I don't need two seperate apps. This is easy to use except that I don't know how to label each color but that doesn't matter too much since my next semester will be different colors anyway.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I picked up this book and could not put it down!  It is a fast paced, easy to read, not predictable, interesting book.  I highly recommend it!
0307949508|4.0|i didnt read the book my self i have it sent to my son but i ask him how he likes the books i send and he said it was a good book and would recomend it to other people to read
B006LSZECO|5.0|when i started reading the book i was trying to out think the author, second quessing all the clues, then everything started to fall togeher and i was wrong on all my quesses except about amy, only part i thought was a little lame was the final part of the motel with jeff and greta
B000Y7U98C|3.0|What this movie's about, the story, the twists, all that I loved. Cool looking scenes, interesting concepts; a real 2001 Space Odyssey feel. Afterward I found myself thinking... none of the characters had any depth to them. They were largely predictable in their roles and unimaginative in their execution. The main character, Capa, hardly says a word. He's got an enemy and a friend amongst the crew and only a few scenes make that apparent. Mostly he seems a reluctant participant in the whole movie.
B000GBFQT8|5.0|One of my most cherished childhood school memories was having our teacher read to us from the Narnia books.  I'll never forget being caught up by the magical land in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe which was read to us FIRST!  I know there's a lot of arguments concerning what order the books should be read in: chronological order or as they were published.  Well, I have to say that C.S. Lewis published them in the order he meant for us to read the books so start with LWW.  What a wonderful imagination this man had and how fortunate for us readers that he put his creativity to good use and put his thoughts down on paper.  It's a wonderful and magical trip that any parent should share with their child, they will never forget it.  I know I never will.
B005KELQEU|5.0|Was looking for a slip-in/slip-out cover for my B&N Nook Touch Glo Light (it feels wonderful in the hands so why fix it in a hard cover?) and came across this by chance. Fits perfectly! Very easy in-out with long zip. A bit costly but as said, it is strong and very well made - I suspect it will resist all that I might throw at it, or throw it at! Good buy.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Enjoy it more and more each season. Can't wait to see Clay's role in season 5 so many dynamics will be changing.
B005LAIGRS|1.0|Spoiler alert.  This is the WHOLE movie in a nutshell.  All members of the CIA are evil.  All members of British intelligence are evil.  All member of Israeli intelligence are evil.  Julian Assange and Bradley Manning are (really, really) good.  And this is all TRUE.  The actor Sam Shepard tells us so in the \\"Making of\\" bonus and he knows because he's a friend of Valerie Plame, the faux spy.  The action is totally implausible (as it is in most movies of this genre) but the plot (such as it is) is boring.  Denzel plays Denzel really well (he's got that down pat) and Ryan Reynolds plays himself (not a compliment).  A total waste of time.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Enjoying this very much.  Can't wait for each new adventure to unfold, while asking myself \\"How would I handle that situation?\\". Could I be so brave?
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Since this album was introduced to me in November of 2010, it has remained in my car for frequent playing. Each song has meant so much to me at different times in my life, and the soulful, widely interpretive lyrics mean that a song's meaning can change for me depending on the situation. A great album to sing your heart out to.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Its a vary good movie you need to see it you need to see it to see it need to see it
B008MEM24S|4.0|this is and enjoyable game most of the time you can get the noams. the balloony game was pretty fun to.
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|Being a huge Zeppelin fan and hard rock and roll fan in general it actually surprised me how much I throughly enjoyed this show. I  think Robert Plants voice sounds better as he sings softer now than it did in his hey day as the golden voice of Led Zeppelin. The other musicians that make up the Band of Joy are tops in their field. This is a show that I would pay good money to see them play. I am very happy that I bought this DVD so that I can enjoy this show many more times over the years to come. Music lovers of all different styles of music will be very pleased with this performance.
B006RUJST6|1.0|I was very disappointed. The whole premise of Slammed was too predicable and in many ways juvenile. It led to a very disappointing read.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Saying this is not Gillian Flynn's best book is really not saying much. She is such an excellent writer that it's like saying, \\"Of these three delicious cupcakes, I loved this one the least.\\" It was still excellent and I devoured it with the same gusto as \\"Gone Girl\\" and \\"Dark Places.\\" Same heavy atmospherics, same nuanced characters, same devilishly clever plot twists and turns--a book that makes you wish you had not read it yet so you could read it again. It's hard to pin down why this one was the least of the three for me. I guess the characters seemed less complex, a little more formulaic than in her other work. And it took me a long time to begin to relate to Camille, the protagonist--but that may not be the case for other readers. It's still better than most of the fiction out there these days.
0345534379|5.0|My boys love it.  They look up stats and are just amazed at all the information that is included.  Compact so it can be taken for reading along the way.
B00846REIS|5.0|I have read many romance novels. This is one of few that I would, and have, re-read. It has everything a great romance novel needs; it is difficult to set down, it has exciting, interesting characters and several intriguing, often heated plots, some yet to be answered. My favorite so far! Can't wait for the sequel!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm not a wordsmith so I'll keep this short. I've read a few great Stephen King books and loved them all. This was, by far, my favorite. Between work and kids and the rest of life, I had to read this book in short bursts over the coarse of several weeks. Last night I started at 80% on my Kindle, knowing I had a few more nights of reading. Not too long after I started, the plot became so intense, I couldn't stop! I had to finish. I had to know if Jake succeeded and how it might change history! I didn't move for the next three hours, and when I got the end of this book, my heart was racing and I had tears in my eyes. King is a magnificent writer and this book is one of his greatest works.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I enjoyed the box set of all 8 discs. All are in good shape.I recieved them in a timely maner.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I have never written a review of a book before but felt I had to regarding this one.  I read many books and after reading the reviews for Gone Girl, I decided to purchase this for my Kindle.  I can't remember the last time I couldn't make it through a book because it was incredibly boring, but Gone Girl was just that...BORING!  After making it through about a third of the way I couldn't stand it anymore and had to give up and purchase another book.  This book was a truly painful read, the characters made me angry and I could not relate to any of them.  This is the first time that the reviews of a book have let me down.  Gone Girl is a gone book for me!
B005WMQ5R8|2.0|Before I start this review I better point out that I am not a anime fan.<br /><br />Anyway Redline is a very mediocre movie. the voice acting isn't great and the story is kinda lame it felt to bare bones I felt like there was something I missed like this movie was a sequel to something which obviously meant piss poor character development. Don't get me wrong the characters had some cool designs but it was ruined by the bad character development. Even the animation isnt good its only cool during the turbo high speed scenes. All in all this movie felt kinda rushed. I say skip.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Calming and challenging. Nice time consumer. Background music is nice. Harder than it looks. Good for the price. I like it.
B00935KWWO|5.0|I love the sleek display and the way it handles images. I have tried many other clients and this one stands out as my favorite.
0307744434|5.0|You're waiting for a connecting flight at an airport and decide to walk around to pass the time.  Employees stand inside their glass cases, waiting to show off their wares: cologne, perfume, chocolate, and wine.  Tantalizing scents float to your nose from expensive restaurants.  There's steak and chicken and you're fairly certain someone is frying bacon.  But you're not hungry or thirsty and you think you smell just fine.  You feel as if you're walking in circles and then you find it.  You find what you've been looking for.<br /><br />The book store.<br /><br />It's not fancy and it's nothing compared to that two-story Barnes & Noble you found once--it had an escalator.  No, this store is tiny, but cozy, decorated in yellows and oranges.  The seats in the center are green and blue.  You find the hot and cool colors balance each other perfectly and you decide to browse.  The books remind you of when you used to curl up with your favorite by an open window and read for hours.  You visit your favorite sections: Romance, then Horror, then Western.  You give the Young Adult section a knowing glance before moving on.  You avoid the one section that's meant to draw your eye.  It's an elaborate metal shelf with filigree designs on the side and a circular ornament in the center.  Within the circle, written in arching letters, is this: Bestsellers.<br /><br />You don't care much for bestsellers.  Congratulations to the people who can write them, but if a book was really good, wouldn't you have heard of it by now?  You check your watch.  You still have too much time before your flight arrives.  You sigh and scan the books on the shelf.  One catches your eye.  It's cover consists of only three colors: black, red, and white.  The Night Circus, it reads.  You raise an eyebrow.  You like circuses as much as the next person, but what could be so fascinating about a nocturnal circus that would make it a bestseller?<br /><br />You pick up the book and read the first page: \\"The circusarrives without warning.\\"  Huh.  As you continue, you realize this whole chapter is written not only in present tense but second person.  You've taken writing classes, you know a real writer shouldn't write in second person.  You put the book back and go to wait for your plane by the gate.<br /><br />Weeks later, the book is still in your mind.  The cover was so pretty, and you know not to judge a book by its cover, but the design seems imprinted on your brain: a man and a woman separated by a circus tent.  The first line echoes in your thoughts: \\"The circus arrives without warning.\\"  The more you think about it, the better it sounds.  It has everything a story needs: it combines plot with mystery with anticipation.  It arrives without warning.<br /><br />You set out the next day to your local bookstore.  It's nothing grand, but it's the only one in town.  You're not sure why, but you can't have it on your Kindle.  You need the physical book.  You need to feel the cover in your hand and flip the pages with your fingers.<br /><br />You buy the book, bring it home, and sit down with it--and you don't stop until the next day.  The present tense lends the narrator such an active voice that it becomes irresistible.  The author paints images you've only seen in your dreams and there are some things you've never dreamed of.  What you thought would be a straightforward story becomes two, then three.  You can't decide which is your favorite, which ending is most important.  You're horrified when a character dies--because he dies without warning.<br /><br />The love story between Celia and Marco becomes the love story you've always wanted.  Pitted against each other by their teachers, you wonder if one will sacrifice him- or herself for the other.  You wonder if you would.  You hope they figure out a way to be together, you hope this is anything but a Romeo and Juliet story.  You are not disappointed.<br /><br />The story between Bailey and Poppet is a little more predictable, but that's what happens with characters who can see the future.  And you like Bailey.  You like Bailey as if he's a real person, as if you've known him since he was a child and then you realize it: Bailey reminds you of yourself or a past you.  He is young and hopeful and filled with dreams.  He has remarkable paths ahead of him, incredible destinies, and even in the end you're not sure if he chooses correctly.  Is it the choice you would make?<br /><br />You finally finish the book.  The story has all the things you love: magic and mirrors, doors and jars, contortionists and acrobats.  How, you wonder, how has the year 2012 come and you've never heard of this story?  How are you now just reading it?<br /><br />You pick the book back up and begin again.<br /><br />\\"The circus arrives without warning.\\"
B004TUKNX6|4.0|I wrote many, many papers in college while listening to this album.  I wish they would have left the album name alone in the ID3 tags though.  About the only complaint and the smallest possible one is having to constantly rename tracks is inconvenient.
1608871045|5.0|This is a great book to add to any batman fans collection. It's packed with lots of great stuff. Done in a way that really makes you feel like you have a real piece of both The Dark Knights world, and Gotham Police files. Lots of facts, blueprints, communication stickys between Alfred, Lucious Fox, and Bruce Wayne. All leading to how Batman evolves. The police files are done in a way that make you feel like you actually have the real deal in your hands. The Joker cards are in here too as evidence files. There are criminal bios in here also, written as though the Dark Knight himself authored them as part of his investigations. I thought that map of Gotham was a great touch also. It was fun tracing down where certain events took place and imagining the ground Batman has to cover. Really cool stuff! For sure worth adding in your collection.
B0013F1D02|5.0|this story has everything and yet is so heartwarming. I will definitely be buying this on DVD one day. This for sure should be a classic. Wish I had read the book though, I knew stardust sounded familiar... i shouldve googled it before watching. Oh well.
0553378384|4.0|It has been really a \\"surprise\\",as soon i started to reed it,the effect that was producing inside me.<br />In some way like cleaning my \\"reed-glasses\\"away from a little rest of a kind of \\"oil film\\" that , as a Pediatric Doctor, but almost as a HUMAN BEAN i was looking for but not in a consciencious way because I didn´t know nearly nothing about the astrological points of view,and with that Author´s book i found another \\"road\\" to understand our behaviour and more...
1577314808|5.0|A must read for those of us who struggle with letting go of \\"should have done\\" or \\"what's going to happen\\"... learning how to live fully at this moment has fundamentally changed me.  Depression is only occasionally evident and only lasts for hours rather than months.  The truth in this book is universal.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|What can you say about these three exciting movies other than if you are a fan of Action movies with GREAT plots and wonderful acting!?!  Not much else because it has ALL these things.  These movies are FUN! FUN! FUN!
B001GUXJQA|3.0|I have read several of Michael Connelly's books via Kindle, but this one is hard to read because there are so many errors in the kindle edition. For instance, when you turn a page it doesn't match the previous page. The last sentence isn't finished or in other cases it is repeated. This happens so frequently it is very annoying and distracting. I'm sorry I bought this, with so many others to choose from.
B000050HTO|5.0|I was having an itch to hear Dylan doing some of his early, great art and this CD gives it to you! I've listened to it a number of times and I will continue to do so.  If you are a Dylan fan, this CD is for you!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This really is a great app for the end of the day when you've finally got everything done and just need to wind down for bed. The timer feature is great for falling asleep with it as well. While I haven't tried the binaural beats yet either, the list of sounds is varied enough that just about anyone should find something relaxing.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|One of my very favorites. I love the actors, especially Will Smith. They all do a great job. The story inspires good old national pride which we need badly these days. I'm delighted to have my own copy
B00881VLCE|4.0|fun! just wish we had more of a variety to choose from&hellip;or fhe option to upload pics from our gallery.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Better than book 2 but not as good as Book 1.  Worth reading all 3 just for the completion of the story.
B004LWZW6U|4.0|I purchased this 3D film for under $15 and expected it to stink. Surprise!!! It is one of the funniest movies I have seen this year.<br /><br />What makes this film a gem is the fact that Director John Gulager knows that this is just another Piranha film and he doesn't expect to win any Academy Awards with it. Never taking the film content too serious, Gulagar goes all out with the over the top comedy and gore. KUDOS JOHN!!! YOUR FORMULA WORKS!!!<br /><br /> There are no disappointments for the viewers who enjoy extreme \\"pop-out\\" 3D. A few shots had me reaching for 3D objects in front of my nose.<br /><br />My only complaint with this film is that when watching the Ving Rhames pool scene, I had to constantly remove my 3D glasses and wipe my eyes because I was laughing so hard I was crying.  (O.K. So that's not really a complaint.)<br /><br />This film is a must for anyone who loves horror, comedy, and 3D.
B008JH5CVS|5.0|It's a \\"prison hostage escape\\" caper set in outer space, but very verbal for all its action,<br />with a lot of quirky characters, odd accents (one of which, belonging to the most brutal of the<br />inmates, is all but unintelligible), and a hero (Guy Pearce) who is actually witty. Not just spouting<br />jests that fall flat (as so often in other films), but genuinely funny, with a dry, trust-no<br />one sensibility that recalls Steve McQueen and Paul Newman in their youth. Pearce looks great<br />all pumped up, and his romantic interest is an attractive blonde. Unfortunately, the writer<br />and director want to establish her as a modern-style \\"I'm as tough as any man\\" character, which<br />leads her to be rude and abusive to Pearce even as he's saving her life. Perhaps it's supposed<br />to be part of the film's comic style. Whatever. But the violence is very, very pronounced, and<br />if ever there was an argument in favor of capital punishment, this movie's portrayal of the<br />inmates who take over the prison is that argument. The head of the hostage-takers is cool in<br />his actions, methodical. The most brutal one is a loose cannon. But both really are as vicious<br />and evil as anything in a vampire flick.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the new app and how easily you can change categories! I like the format on my Kindle Fire.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Combines the romance of Romeo and Juliet, the action of The Gladiators with the utter sadness and horror of Sophie's Choice.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|I loved the Jimmy Page segments.  I liked Jack White's comments about his growing up where guitar wasn't cool, cramming two drumsets into his tiny bedroom, his upholstery shop music lessons, the immediately built primitive guitar made out of a 2X4, etc.  Edge seemed nervous or even somehow out of his league.  He comes off as a technocrat.  I own a lot of U2 albums but I don't listen to them much any more.  I like Edge as a human being - he has come up with some good songs and sounds...but in this movie, I get the sense that Page and White are the real artists.  Or that their muse is more immediately accessible to them without technology.  Page is God in the rock guitar world - let's face it.  Regardless of all the hype about Hendrix, when it comes to music I care to actually * listen * to, Page is head and shoulders about Hendrix.  Before you blast me - opinions vary - it's just my opinion.  As far as the Jack White haters go - the only thing I found phoney about Jack White was having that younger version pseudo-doppleganger of him that he would talk to - that seemed a bit puzzling / contrived.  The guru here who passes on wisdom freely and effortlessly - without ego - is Page.  I notice that when Page shows Kashmir (in the extras), that White seems to pick it up and try it and \\"gets\\" it quicker than Edge.  All that being said, I would gladly see any of these 3 guitarists in concert.
B000VSYDRM|5.0|I am just going to say, \\"...don't give up on it. Watch from beginning 2 nose hair rising end\\".<br /><br />*****Entertaining.<br />*****Astonishing tale of smell!!<br />*****Who knows where the nose goes?
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordan is just amazing. He stats a new series with three new exciting characters in an entirely new way of reading. With Percy out of the mix, and with a new main character, Jason, is getting the hang of it at Camp-Halfblood. His new relationship with Piper is just adorable.  Piper is has a story and she isn't telling her three friends.And with Leo's interesting childhood, makes this book hard to put down.
B008BO61BE|5.0|I can never tell what I'm supposed to be hearing with these \\"remasters\\" ~ I'm never impressed and that hasn't changed here either.. I mean it was already \\"digital quality\\" on the last release and unless you're going back and forth between the two I seriously doubt the human ear could really tell a lot of difference.. other than the fact this new edition is LOUDER. One thing the original pressing has over this is the fact the Hellion intro into Electric Eye was a lot more accurate.. Once you start Electric Eye on this newer version, you will hear more of the Hellion.. doesn't really matter to me but it seemed worth noting. The \\"bonus track\\" Prisoner Of Your Eyes doesn't do a lot for me and the live recordings are competent but ---<br /><br />The US Festival is why you should buy this. I had waited a LONG time to hear this and was buying it sight unheard in the hopes it would at least sound \\"serviceable\\"... but...I have never before heard a mix this good of a live show! (I use a simple lil Sony 5.1 in-a-box sound system) WOW!! It almost seems too balanced as though there may be some slight of hand going on but I doubt it. I was at this show, a young lad more interested in Ozzy than Priest in those days but wisdom has caught up to me. We lived nearby and came up the night before and slept on the hood of my sisters car.. and were treated to the best damn concert in history the following day (NOT Van Halen)!! NOBODY sells a song or is more vested in his music than Rob Halford, simply watch Metal Gods from this show and you'll know what I mean..Make no mistake, Judas Priest absolutely owned the US Festival, here is your proof ~ start buying.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is just wonderful. Rick Riordan knows what he is doing and he is just making it fun for the reader. I can not put the book down. Sure there are typos in the digital version but who cares. this book is great and I can't wait for the next one to come in Fall of 2012.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|Unbelievably good. Without being too flowery, his descriptions of place are so vivid I could see them in my mind. While telling his story, he masterfully weaves in phrases about life, love, spirituality that can change your life. Even though it is a lengthy book, I will definitely read it again in order to write down some of those phrases.

B008QDCZJ2|4.0|Pet Shop Boys have been an integral part of my life as an adult.  Although they have not reached the heights of the early part of their career for some time, they have remained close enough to keep my attention.  Release and Yes were for example among my favorite albums during the last decade.<br /><br />I really wanted this album to be great, with the PSB gaining a mini resurgence with their very pop oriented 2009 Yes that saw them in better form than one should expect from artists having been in the field for 25 years.  Also, it is rumored that this might be their final album.  Unfortunately, Elysium falls short of being great and is among the PSB's least interesting releases of their career. Fans have had the opportunity to listen to the album before its release on the internet via streaming on a Guardian site so I have had a few days to digest the album.<br /><br />Warning signs were abundant.  The track Invisible was introduced on the PSB website a few months ago.  It is a slow and long meandering song it that should simply be B-side material.  Then, ahead of the Olympics, the first single was released, Winner, which really is anything but that.  A very predictable song, Winner just does not catch fire and is without doubt the worst lead off PSB single since Before was released almost two decades ago.  The follow-up song, Leaving, was released at the end of August.  This song has been widely compared to the PSB classic Being Boring, but from my standpoint, it swerves more in the direction of the non-loved Before.<br /><br />Those 3 songs start the album and the 4th song, Your Early Stuff, are all thus rather un-inspiring.  It isn't until song 5 that things get somewhat moving.  A Face Like That sounds a bit much like something from the early PSB era, but it is a good punchy song.  The following song, Breathing Space, is not bad but still rather average.  It is followed by the fun song Ego Music.  This track has received rather negative comments of PSB forums but I do like it, think it is somewhat clever, very PSB.  Hold On is yet another bland song but then the 4 closing tracks happen to be PSB at their very best.  Give It a Go is a joyful and bouncy track, yet full of warmth.  Then, close to the very end, the best tracks appear.  Memory of the Future is my favorite track, with fantastic strings, catchy tune and arrangements among the best in PSB's career.  Everything Means Something is a close 2nd favorite of mine, a slower song that reminds of the best moments from Behavior and Release.  The closing track, Requiem in Denim and Leopardskin, does not match the quality of the previous 2 tracks but is still a great track.<br /><br />Adding this up, there are 2 fantastic tracks found on Elysium, 4 that range from being good to really good, leaving 6 tracks (half of the album) being well below average.  At least 2-3 additional stand-out tracks are needed to lift this album from falling short.  Incredibly, PSB have one in their collection but decided to leave the great A Certain Je Ne Sais Quoi as a B-side on the Winner single.  Elysium is, sadly, among the weaker PSB albums.<br /><br />To give a sense of my views of what is high-standard Pet Shop Boys (that many will certainly disagree with) I rank below my opinion of their albums, from best to \\"worst\\".<br /><br />1. Very<br />2. Actually<br />3. Release<br />4. Behavior<br />5. Yes<br />6. Introspective<br />7. Please<br />8. Fundamental<br />9. Elysium<br />10. Nightlife<br />11. Bilingual<br /><br />Addition 11.9.2012 - Many reviewers have pointed out that Elysium is similar to Behavior, an album that received negative views 2 decades ago upon release but is cherished today.  The implication is that those who do not adore Elysium just don't get it as with Behavior a long time ago or are simply stuck in the PSB dance camp.  This is condescending; I loved Behavior from the very beginning and many slow PSB songs are among my favorites.  Reality is, as others have pointed out,many of the songs and production on Elysium are simply not imaginative and well crafted songwriting wise as one normally expects from PSB.<br /><br />Addition #2 26.9.2012 - An initial rather negative review deserves an update after further listening.  This album benefits from repeated listening, especially the first three tracks grow as album tracks, not listened to individually (Leaving and Winner are questionable choices as singles).  This is in my view thus a better album than Fundamental and Please.  I am tempted rating it 4 stars, given that I at one point gave Fundamental such a grade, but it simply lacks a little excitement to deserve it (meaning that my Fundamental grade is too generous).  Including I Started a Joke and A Certain Je Ne Sais Quoi on the album as opposed to be left as B-sides for the Winner single would have gone a long way making this a truly worthwhile album.<br /><br />Addition #3 1.4.2013 - This review is turning into a Never Ending Story. Despite being initially underwhelmed by Elysium, this album has with a few modifications been in constant rotation at my house. By adding the tracks mentioned in addition #2 into the mix at the expense of Hold On and Breathing Space, this is a very solid album. I have thus bumped the rating up to 4 stars and rate Elysium as an average PSB release, which is actually close to being anything but boring and closer to heaven.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I got this game when it was free on the Android Appstore, and I have to say, it would be worth getting even if you had to pay.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this..works well and really is a challenge. I want more free play! Please :) I even installed it ony ipod. Thank you for readingy review, I only review good apps.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was not what I expected...I was checking it out because my children wanted to read it. I couldn't put it down, it was awesome. Very shockingly good!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|addictive. addictice. addictice.  heroin would be easier to kick than this game. seemingly simple puzzles that turn into hair pullers.
B008N1LL42|5.0|DID NOT THINK I WOULD LIKE THIS ONE, BUT I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! GREAT GRAPHICS, ACTING AND STORY. SO BELIEVABLE THAT I WAS ACTUALLY CHEERING AT THE END! LUVIT!
B003Y5H57E|5.0|This movie is funny . It involves 3 different couples and they all come together toward the end. I love romantic comedies so this is a good one :)
B001CDZZI6|2.0|This process results in a status quo situation ~ you still dont know what jobs (by name) fits your profile
B00190OHD6|5.0|This movie is awesome for couples to watch :) . The movie lets you realize how precious life is. Its very mushy so guys i would decide to watch this with just your girl and you snuggled together.  But also very funny as well :)
B002VHI8J0|5.0|Mitchell is a genius for writing such an interesting book. It blends seamlessly with all the time period and invoked a vast array of emotions from me. The Orison of Sonmi-451 moved me to tears with the chilling cannibalism/meat recycling part and Frobisher waxing lyrical a half finished story is like a half finished love affair. The stories are moving, and so poignant. What David Mitchell writes about the future may very well happen if humanity and its ever going consumerism has its way. Thumbs up all the way
B0054JZC6E|5.0|just a little hard I would recommend this game just to waste time<br />it takes a lttli time to finish it
B0053VKP8S|1.0|I've been trying for several weeks to get this product to function in a reasonable way as an interface between a Visio E320VA television and a audio system. This television has particularly poor quality sound - it needs help.<br /><br />I find it is straight forward to hook the  Fiio D3 to the optical SPDIF output from the television and the analog cable to the audio system. This works okay as long as you don't change channels on the television. When you change channels, the optical connection looses it synchronization, and I am  treated to a FULL VOLUME blast of static noise that lasts about a second before the audio from the new channel comes on.<br /><br />This is totally unacceptable and a much worse issue than the poor quality audio I'm trying to correct.<br /><br />This product is worthless for this application.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very addictive!  needs more quests in the higher levels. still can't figure out the visit other villlages part. seems like they are fake....
B006T3RM08|1.0|I had hoped this would be my answer to keeping my bluetooh keyboard and trackpad together.<br />While it does, it also holds both so tight that both power buttons are forever locked in an on / off loop.<br />Supposedly there is a blog on how to stop this problem but the site with the blog never seems to be available.<br />One bright spot was they sent me a full refund.<br />Don't waste your money on this poor execution of a great idea.
B008D28HYS|5.0|If you like CrossMe, you'll love cross me color! You might not need both, because they are pretty similar, but if you're trying to decide between the two, this is definitely the winner.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book and enjoyed the twists though I felt the ending was a little lame.  Would recommend this book for a book club--there are lots of things to discuss.  Enjoyed the book and hated to put it down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was fun to read, has a nice little twist , and doesn't drag on. It's really a great read!
B007TML4EI|4.0|Good game but where are the sound effects?  I like the physics in this game. Good way to be creative.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is the best knife I own. Chops through wood like nothing. It is a real work horse of a knife.
B0055SWM08|5.0|thanks its a good game but I hated the nag screens there annoying. the game is relaxing and fun to play.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|DH and I don't' have children so a movie starring kids rarely makes it past 10 minutes in our house. This movie kept us glued til the end.<br /><br />It's entertaining, moves fast and has fun characters. The kids were good actors and none was obnoxiously 'know it all'<br /><br />solid 4 stars
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come out for ever on my kindel fire!! its fun and addicting!! I love it
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Great value for the price, fast paced, and challenging with the different levels.  Never boring pretty good graphics and options.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very challenging. game. and hard to put down. but nice music. and fun great way to relax. I definitely. would download it. works great on my Kindle fire.
B002WY65W4|5.0|A good, fun, tongue-in-cheek movie outlining the rules for staying alive after the apocalypse while looking for love--and Twinkies.<br /><br />And here are some more words to bring the review up to 20 words. Ta-da!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game, Draw Something, is an absolute delight. Seeing how people try to convey a particular word by drawing a picture is sometimes hilarious. It's a very entertaining game.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|While the story line is interesting, the acting is terrible. If I had seen this at the theatre I would not have puchased this from Amazon. Amazon did have the best price though.
B005LAIHGI|1.0|I enjoyed Borats' crude and offensive humor. This film is a major disappointment. It is just not funny. The gags are weak and very childish. The acting and script is terrible. I felt embarrassed for Ben Kingsley. And, like the Holocaust, you just cannot crack jokes about 9/11. It was a 2 hour waste of my life. The best gags were in the trailer. So, do yourself a favor and watch that. File the rest down the toilet with Kevin Smith films.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I have enjoyed 'Cross Me' and like the variety the color added. Color Cross Me involves a little bit of math and thinking, but is simple and satisfying. I love it when I finish a puzzle! The download was simple and didn't create any problem with my phone.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is one of the best series I have read in years. I could hardly wait till I started ther second book; Shadow of Night; It was just as good. The bad news is that I have to wait for the third to come out.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|After finishing the book, I can honestly say that there was nothing revealed in this book, that I haven't already seen on the History channel a dozen times. The person who revealed the details to the mission, was our own President, and his band of merry minions. I know the SEALs have a code about not discussing their work, but I'm curious as to what the expiration date on that silence is. Many SEALs have told their stories in books, and never garnered such negative reactions.<br />The book is very interesting reading, well written, and a tribute to the all the men and women who worked so hard to capture Bin Laden. (A shout out to the female CIA analyst who tracked him for ten years.)<br />I am grateful to the author for coming forward, and telling us the truth. I will always believe a SEAL over a politician. If the author broke his code of honor, that's between him his conscience, and the SEALs; I think it was a lot of hype. If the government had really wanted this book off the shelves, it would be off the shelves.<br />If you like this type of book, it's a worth while read. If you haven't read the book, and are still posting a review, post it on facebook because nobody cares.
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|Pretend like there are NO STARS highlighted. It doesn't even deserve a one. Rented the movie for teenagers. Even they didn't find it humorous and... didn't even make it to the end of the movie before they had enough. TERRIBLE MOVIE. Totally lame/warped. Save your money and time.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I have been encouraging my grandchildren to read this book. I took the opportunity to read it again myself on Kindle Touch. It brought back all my memories as a young boy reading R.L.Stevenson's timeless book, with its heroes and villains. Thoroughly enjoyed it again after many years. Thank you Amazon for making it available!
0425263908|5.0|This book was a quick read, it literally took me just over a day to read it. It's definitely the a must read if you're looking for something after 50 Shades or even before! Can't wait for part II in October!
B007KOYEOC|1.0|The first 2 books were great! But this book is a waste of time, you know whats going to happen from the beginning. Had to skip a lot of the more graphic scenes out of boredom, there was just too much sex and very little substance. AVOID the third book, but read the 2 first.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I think I must be the only person on the planet that didn't care for this series. Found it dull and boring. Didn't care that much for the first movie either. I must be missing something.  Just couldn't get into it. My husband feels the same way. My husband feels the same. Maybe it is meant for younger people. We are in our 60's.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided to try to watch the movie first then read the book, and now I'm not sure that I can wait for #2 to come out in movie format! This book was awesome. Just awesome. The movie was amazing and the book was better.
B003719G40|5.0|My boyfriend and I both read this book.. I would read parts then he would read them.. The material just makes sense! It's all stuff I think we know but its put down in black and white and just confirms that we all speak different love languages. I think this book will definitely impact my relationship with my boyfriend! :D
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Continues to give me an error message when trying to log in with facebook. What makes them think I would be willing to pay $3 for the full version when the free version doesn't even work?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow, this book is a \\"bar burner\\".. Hot  cannot beginto describe it. Great characters great story, and very hot sex! Highly recommended!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|My new favorite author! I have blown through her other two books and can't put them down. She's an incredible writer.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great book, Luttrell has a much more mature view in his second book. Very insightful to the life of a deployed service member.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fun game. Makes you think outside of the box for solutions. No issues on my Asus Transformer. Entertaining and challenging.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great Read, don't know why the military is so worked up over it. There is nothing that I would find \\"top secret\\" in the book. I couldn't put the book down, read it in a day and a half.
B008XG1X18|4.0|occasionally force closes on Kindle Fire but great to finally have the app. It operates just enough like the web version but also has its own flavor and intuitive interface.
1455508977|5.0|This book was incredible. Sparks is a tantilizing author.  I am now a huge fan! Great Storyline, no graphic sex, a healthy romance.
0525953728|1.0|I was really exited about reading this book and even pre-order it.  Couldn't wait to start reading it.  However, after reading the first chapter, there was something in me that didn't feel right.<br /><br />Regardless whether he disclosed secret military information or not the author of the book, not only broke the non-disclosure agreement that all of them are made to sign,  but also broke the trust and \\"brotherhood\\" code that he shared with his fellow Seals.<br /><br />Even though the majority of the profits are said to go to charity he will still get profits from sales.  To me that's not right.
B005IZNM0W|5.0|Great condition.  Bought for child 4 years old.  He was thrilled  with the colors and performance.  Wonderful addition to our collection.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Loved the movie, and it's worth seeing over and over.  I also rec'd the movie rather promptly, so thank you!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I had an opportunity to upgrade from Sandy Bridge as a trade-in for no additional cost to me. the PCIe 3.0 is nice for when I need to get a graphics card down the road.<br /><br />I overclocked mine to 4.6GHz with the ROG Maximus Gene V and an oversized heat sink. It doesn't run much hotter than my old sandy bridge at 4.5GHz. Maybe I got a good one or they worked on the heat issues or something, but i see no heat dissipation issues here. I'd recommend it!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I got this as a free app of the day. It has turned out to be my favorite game. The music is a great escape from stress and the puzzles are addicting! A wonderful combination. Sweet Addiction!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|z<br />This game is SOOOO fun &amp; ADDICTIVE! I played until the battery was about to die, so here. I sit, tethered to the wall, playing &amp; charging!  I've found my favorite game!  Puts &quot;Farmville&quot; and all th<br />ose copycats TO SHAME!  THIS IS THE ORIGINAL APP, the one all of us grown folks, (25 and up) remember playing! I just hate I wasted my time and money on all those other apps .... Never again! Propers to the creators of this wonderfully endearing game! I LOVE IT!!!!  :o)
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|This app is terrible. If u want to get it don't. I would suggest u get a different app containing adobe.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|From start to finish this movies was not a disappointment. Action, and suspense. A must see if you haven't seen it yet or if you're thinking about seeing it. He acting is superb as well as the stunts!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy the level incease each phrase. New ways to make a mind think is just what a bored person needs.
B007TML4EI|5.0|This is a fun physics game. The idea i similar to other building games (create a structure from anchor points and sticks) but as the levels progress it becomes a little more. The game is very nicely done in terms of the graphics and there is no annoying sound to go with it. Permissions are also minimal.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It great how many games there are it keeps me awake....<br />I would recommend this game for something to do on your spare time or when your bored....
B0063GORYU|4.0|I play Spider on my computer and was so happy I could get it on my Kindle Fire.<br />They play the same, but it is a little harder to do on kindle because of the<br />space.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is very entertaining and jumps right into the plot line.  The author has done an excellent job of showing us how an alternative view and a belief in a personality truly changes our perspective.  This book has twists and turns and very dynamic characters.  I was very impressed how the author developed each character at different points in the novel, a true insight into human personality and perspective, and what we do for love and/or acceptance.

B008602KQI|5.0|My daughters and I all read the trilogy (books) over a 1 week time period and found them to be quite excellent.  We then proceeded to see the movie at the theater to determine how closely it would follow the book (not an easy task by any means due to its complexity).  Of course the book was much more detailed, providing the history and background of the events leading up to the present day etc., I have to say they did a rather good job with the movie.  I like how they pulled it together and allowed you to follow the story line event though you may not have read the book first.  However, once you see the movie, you will definitely want to read the books.  I would highly recommend doing so.

B0080CL0HM|2.0|I picked this movie mostly to watch Robert Pattinson, but unfortunately, I found his character to be \\"ugly\\" inside and out. I usually enjoy watching his movies, but he made a lot of awkward faces and he became distracting to the movie. The plot lines were nothing grabbing or captivating, so it took almost 2 days for me to finish watching it.

0307592839|2.0|I really found this book hard to get into.<br /><br />It is in first person, but each chapter is about someone else, and takes place during a different time in the story, but everything is connected. I don't know when this became popular in novels, but I wish it would stop.<br /><br />At the beginning of each chapter you must first decide who the chapter is about and then when the chapter takes place. Then you have to try to connect all the other names in the chapter to other chapters and times in the books.<br /><br />I only gave it two stars instead of one because I think if the book was actually organized it might have been okay. As it stands, I am not entirely sure when the book started and when it ended.<br /><br />I did find quite a few neat quotes in the book though...

B0036TGSRG|5.0|The Ghost Writer is by far one of the best modern mystery/suspense thrillers I have seen. Be warned now, if you're looking for a non-stop action movie, this isn't one of them. The first half of the movie is mainly build up to the intense ending.<br /><br />To go into much detail about the plot would ruin some of the story, so I would rather say that it reminded me of North by Northwest and The Man Who Knew Too Much at points.<br /><br />5/5 stars. I can't recommend this movie enough.

B0080CLN7Y|5.0|I enjoyed all episodes in Season 3 of Vampire Diaries.  Not only is Vampire Diaries very entertaining, the quality of the download was excellent as well!  The purchase through Amazon was extremely easy, it allowed me to select individual episodes and they were available immediately.  I highly recommend purchasing videos in this manner as it was a very smooth process!
B001C08RHA|4.0|This was definitely a good movie. I'm a thirteen-year-old girl, and I think that -- if and ONLY if you skip through a certain part about ten minutes into the movie -- it is suitable for all ages, though some little kids would likely get scared. Why did I want to watch Iron Man? Basically I absolutely love Marvel, and my friend absolutely loves Robert Downey Jr's character of Iron Man. So when I settled down to watch the first movie, I was expecting only the best.<br /><br />Near the beginning of the movie, as I said, there was a not-so-appropriate scene with Tony Stark aka Iron Man and a news reporter girl. I was watching it with my parents and my seven-year-old brother, and my parents turned it off. I wasn't allowed to see the rest for a while -- not until it was recommended by some very reliable people. When I was allowed to finish watching Iron Man, me and my dad saw the rest together. It was a great movie, with an epic playboy Tony, a nice likeable Pepper, a ruthless evil Obediah, and an awesome trusty Rhodey, not to mention the handy robot J.A.R.V.I.S.<br /><br />I won't spoil the plot, but that plot was awesome! As with all of Marvel's movies, it was the kind of thing that glues you in place till it's over. Tony was not the classic hero. In fact, he was a bit too egotistical. But although he was nothing like your Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman, he still had that great superhero appeal. And he wanted to help people, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />Yes, Tony Stark was played by Robert Downey Jr. If you know a bit about that particular actor... well, you know he is a bit like Iron Man, only not a hero. But let's not think too much about the actors' personal lives -- Robert did an awesome job at portraying Tony. It was really incredible, what made the movie so great. Yes, it was the director; yes, it was the scriptwriter; yes, it was the epic Marvelness; yes, it was the designers; yes, it was totally the other actors; but most of all, it was the performance of Downey. Congratulations, Robert!<br /><br />All in all, Iron Man was a fantastic movie. I would be more than willing to rewatch it several times over; but, then again, there are quite a few movies I like to rewatch. But Iron Man is definitely worth watching at least once.

B005NKIQ26|5.0|This album is very incredible. I am a thirteen-year-old belieber who was so fortunate as to receive Under The Mistletoe on the Christmas it came out. It was the first CD I ever got just for me, and I was definitely, absolutely, not disappointed.<br /><br />I admit that my favorite of Justin Bieber's albums was My World, and that I prefer his older style of music to what it's turning into. But I love his more grown up voice, and the melodious sounding rhythms are still epic to listen to. The songs on Under The Mistletoe, though different, are all very beautiful. Pray is awesome for all religious people, and an especially beautiful song. Silent Night is a classic made all the more beautiful by JB. Mistletoe is epic original. There's not a single song on that album that's not amazingly amazing.<br /><br />So, as much as I preferred his older songs like Favorite Girl and Love Me... Under The Mistletoe is still so wonderful that I can't possibly rate it less than five stars.
0345803485|4.0|I was originally attracted to this trilogy when I heard about the kinky BDSM sex scenes it was filled with.  I, however, got hooked on these books when a much thicker plot than just sex appeared towards the end of the first novel. The two main characters, Anastasia and Christian are two emotionally dysfunctional people who happen to fall in love in the middle of BDSM sex, high speed car chases and even life threatening situations. If you are a romance novel fan, Fifty Shades of Grey is a great book to give you the kinky sex scenes you crave as well as provide you an unconventional love story.
B004289ZW0|2.0|I use this unit in my aircraft with WingX on my Ipad.<br />I have the most recent version.<br />It works well when it is charged up.<br />However, it often has no charge, because it TURNS ITSELF ON all the time when it is in my flightbag.<br />Then it runs the battery down.<br />I blame the horrible finger swipe on/off.<br />I have tried carrying it in various pouches, but nothing works.<br />I am now experimenting with keeping it in tupperware container, but my patience has run out.<br />I am replacing this unit with a Garmin GLO.<br />Do not poo-poo the people who complain about the swipe on/off, they have a real gripe.<br />Also, keep a paper clip handy, you have to push the 'reset' button all the time.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  You not only have the challenge of completing each puzzle but then you can go back and try to complete each one again by doing it perfectly.  You can earn hints by doing the games perfectly so if you get absolutely stuck one there is help.  The music goes along<br />with the game to help make it relaxing.  I also like the fact that there is no time limit.
B002OPYUSM|5.0|Community is absolutely hilarious; very, very well written; and amazingly well acted! I watched the pilot and I could not stop watching!  I'm already halfway through the season and I'm loving every minute of it!
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was very well adapted from the book. As with any adaptation, there were small differences, but with the special features on the blueray, the differences are explained, and accepted by the book's author.That was one of the bonuses of the making of the movie, having the author give the screen writer's the options to come and explain their changes, just so the movie's flow worked without slowing the storyline.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Although a good continuation from Book One, I found myself getting a bit bored with the sex scenes. I felt it was taking away from the plot of the book, which was pretty good.
B007FQDPL8|5.0|Its what It should be. Great picture quality, and if you like vampires and such, you'll enjoy this product. HBO did a very good job with the story lines in this series.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I definitely like book 2 better than book 1(even though Anatasia still gets on my nerves). Easy read, great pace and LOT'S of drama. I flew through this one in 2 days!!!
1881273873|5.0|Gary Chapman has written a masterpiece...actually several or them. The Five Languages of Love, Singles Edition has changed my life, not only with my gentleman friend but with those I work with, the Seniors I work with, friends and relatives. I have given the book to my gentleman friend and have already noticed a change in his love for me.  It is my wish that everyone 'wondering' about love in their lives would discover and read this book.  It truly IS a life changer!
B007CKNX28|5.0|I'm a long time fan of Jack's music and must say that I am super impressed with this solo album. It's got a little bit of everything on it from balls out Rock n Roll to folksy blues and a slow piano ballad. When I first listened to it I had a real \\"beggars banquet\\" listening experience. Since then I've been listening to it several times a week. I thank Jack for that because it's been a long time since any album was released that I listen to in its entirety over and over again. I am also looking forward to seeing Jack live in early October. I recommend everyone go to you tube and check out jack white live amex unstaged. He plays a lot from Blunderbuss and there is also White Stripes, Raconteur, and Dead Weather material played. I must say I am quite partial to his new all female band. Although the all male band kicks butt as well. 5 Stars for Blunderbuss!! - Jack White is the real Deal!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Nice plot and fun to interact with... the items in the game are a little pricy though... but u get money really fast.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is one of the most poorly written and sophomoric books I have ever read.  I know the author is laughing all the way to the bank but \\"HOLY CRAP!\\" how have 40,000,000 readers fallen for this garbage? My subconscious tells me  I am the biggest idiot around for not dropping this  book after 10 pages and my inner goddess is in full agreement.  Alas, I am still reading........
B0012351YE|5.0|Absolutely amazed about this band. I never heard of PT until recently and this is the first one I bought of any of their releases. Think of them as a refined spacey version of Tool and you'll be pretty close. If you are a prog rock fan from the 70's, these guys won't disappoint.<br /><br />But please, buy the CD and digitize rather than buy the downloads or else you will miss out on \\"Arriving Someplace But Not Here\\", a twelve-minute song that as far as I'm concerned is the album centerpiece. Also, you don't get the hidden track \\"Shesmovedon\\", an absolutely lovely tune.<br /><br />I'm buying more of these guys works!
B00846REIS|1.0|I bought it because it was recommended to me after reading the 50 Shades Trilogy. I thought it was terrible. Totally cheesy. Felt like it was trying way too hard.
B008AWBQGW|1.0|This band has only 1 original member. A sad comment on the Skynyrd legacy. Just Gary trying to carry on something that should have been put out of it's misery long ago. Were Artimus and Ed King in the ban then we could call it Skynyrd.
8866131350|5.0|I bought this notebook because a friend of mine had it (apparently Yale gives it to its students every year for free). It is my first Moleskin purchase, so I can't assess whether the quality of the product lives up to the brand's prestige, but I would say it is definitely worth my buck. I don't like big bulky planners because I leave them lying around and forget to use them, and this one fits perfectly in my small purse and comes in very handy at all times. I usually just write down one-liner appointments and things to do so I don't need that much space anyway, and I never got used to using online calendars so this was a great purchase for me. Another friend of mine purchased the book as well and is very pleased with it.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Time travel has been a staple of science fiction writers since H. G. Wells wrote his immortal book  'The Time Machine', and most writers, at one time or another try their hand at it. Horror writer Stephen King is no exception. '11/22/63' is about a modern Maine small town schoolteacher who is shown a mysterious portal to the past that is located in the storeroom of a local diner. The diner's owner has mysteriously aged many years, and now is in the final stage of lung cancer that he seems to have acquired, literally, overnight! He tells our hero, the school teacher, about this portal that he stumbled upon accidently when he opened the diner. Walking through it takes one to the same spot in the same Maine town on a particular September day in 1958. But this portal has a certain set of \\"rules\\". First of all, every time one goes through the portal, it's the same hour of the same day. Also, every time is the first time - meaning that if you meet someone on one trip, you have to meet them all over again on subsequent trips. And finally, no matter how long you stay in the past, when you come back through the portal into the present, only two minutes of 21st century time has elapsed.<br /><br />Al, the owner of the diner, decided last night, after making many such trips (seems that he's been buying his restaurant food supplies in 1958 and selling them in 2011 at impossibly cheap prices) that he would go back to 1958 and stay there for five years, travel to Dallas, Texas and somehow prevent Lee Harvey Oswald from killing President John F. Kennedy. Unfortunately for our diner owner, as he continued to age in the past, he contracts lung cancer and becomes so ill that he can't carry out his task. That explains his over-night deterioration. He was gone for two minutes, but came back five years older and with a terminal illness. He then convinces our hero, the young bachelor schoolteacher, to try to do the same job. Hopefully, his youth will allow him to complete the mission, that Al, the diner owner was unable to do.<br /><br />Like most King books, this one has the makings of a great yarn and is a corking good idea for a story. Unfortunately, I never thought that King was a very good writer. Good storyteller? Yes. Good writer? No. One problem with this book is that we live every one of those five years from September, 1958 to November, 1963 with the protagonist. King spends much too much time setting up the core theme of the story: that the past is obdurate and doesn't WANT to be changed. We watch as our hero tries to change things that he knows happened. Such as the permanent injury of the custodian at our teacher's 21st century high school. The custodian was left crippled, and with a limp, as a child, when his drunken father attacked the family with a sledgehammer on Halloween night, 1958. Almost a third of the book is taken up with our hero trying to stop that terrible event from occurring.<br /><br />The book is a compelling read, and Mr. King has done his homework. I found no anachronisms and his many references to events, mores, attitudes, fads and slang speech are all very correct (this reader was 13 in 1958 and lived through this period). Still, the leisurely pace of the book had me frustrated at times but it does pick up the excitement toward the end. I'd say that it was, overall, a fun read. In fact, it is easily the best I've ever read from Stephen King, at least from a writing point of view. It may be his best work yet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire! This one is good too,just plain old solitaire, no surprises, just fun :) My kids love playing too :)
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie version of  \\" The Hunger Game \\" is quite good ... but misses being a great movie by steering away from the book . Yeah , I know , it is very difficult to follow the book exactly . It would make the movie too long , The thing is ... the additions to this might total 8 to 12 minutes total . The character Haymitch was cast wrong ( sorry Woody ) Somebody a bit mored ... \\" Gruff \\" should have been cast . The music was good ... Prim was good ... Peeta was better than expected ... Katniss was strong but not as athletic as I expected ... It seems like I didn't like the film ... But I did . It was a good job but I wqas hoping for a bit better ... The Avengers spoiled me .
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Stayed up til 3am to finish it.  It was better than the first book.  Now in to the 3rd book
B009329Y30|4.0|He loves animals and kids, can fix a broken gutter and can get the old boat running. He can even play the piano! He is also a hunk who just shows up in Louisiana with his dog. The locals are skeptical but leave it to Blythe Danner to start the ball rolling. This is a Lifetime type movie which is very watchable on a rainy Sunday. Keep some tissues handy. Zac could smile more but is quite good as an ex-Marine with PTSD. I watched it twice.
159448385X|5.0|As another reviewer suggested, this story is not for the faint of heart-it is in fact heart wrenching and at times disturbing.  I loved The Kite Runner and for me, a Thousand Splendid Suns was even better.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I have seen my fair share of superhero movies, and I find most of them to be garbage, you know, bad acting, no plot what so ever, action every 10 minutes, and stupid comedy sequences that just ruin the film, so I had my doubts about the modern Batman trilogy, I am very delighted to say that this superhero movie, does not fall into any of what I mentioned above.<br /><br />First off, the acting is just superb, starting of course with Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, who really delivers a strong performance, I have come to be a big fan of Christian Bale, and it all started with this movie, I find that there is not many good actors out there today, but set aside a few, (Leonardo Dicaprio, Matt Damon, Johnny Depp) and Christian Bale, Michael Caine does a fine job at playing the butler Alfred, his accent, and facial expressions really fit the part which is looking out for Bruce Wayne's future, because he pretty much takes the father role after Bruce's parents are killed, poor kid, Rutger Hauer plays the head of Wayne Enterprises after he is killed, and I've always liked Rutger Hauer, he's not in it that much, but you know he's there, and Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors from the old school, and I was so delighted to see that he had a part in this movie, and a very big one at that, he play Ducat, and teaches Bruce how to fight, and he plays an important part to the story, you will see what I mean, Gary Oldman plays Jim Gordon, and does a fantastic job, he usually plays bad guys in movies, but this time, he's a good guy, and finally the great Morgan Freeman as Lucious Fox, the man who introduces Bruce to all the high tech gadgets, and explains them, he is perfect for the role.<br /><br />And like I said, the story is compelling and keeps you interested as it really is a story about revenge, and humanity, and any normal person can relate to what Bruce is going through in his life, as we have all lost loved ones, it just makes it that much more interesting.<br /><br />And the sets and special effects are just superb, not a lot of CGI was used in these movies either, which just adds to the talent and work that was put into these films, those sets of Gotham City were actually BUILT if you watch the documentaries, and the action sequences are very well done, as real as you can get for a fictional superhero movie.<br /><br />And if you watch this movie on blu-ray, the work that Warner Brothers put into this disc is just the best, the picture is just stunning, just wait until you see the shots of Gotham City, and the scenes where Ducat is training Bruce on the ice in the mountains, the colors just jump right out and the image is so sharp, it's like you're really there, and the audio is loud and crisp, you can hear EVERYTHING, especially if you put it on the True HD audio channel, and have a stereo hooked up to your tv, it will basically feel like you're watching this in a theatre.<br /><br />So final word, this is one of the few superhero trilogys that are very well done, my hats off to Christopher Nolan for not going into the cliche of most modern movies and overloading them with CGI and stupid comedy that ruins the movies and adds nothing to them, my rating is 5/5, also if you like this movie, watch The Dark Knight in blu-ray, I don't know which movie I liked better honestly, just watch them both, and when The Dark Knight Rises comes out on home video, I will be the first to be at my local store, I can't wait!
B001EN71CW|5.0|\\"I can't believe that there is no more of this to watch--I will not believe it!!  I'm gonna start thinking bad, desperate, &  evil thoughts until someone gives me another fix!!\\"  Way back in 2005, when \\"Serenity\\" first appeared, I had never heard of \\"Firefly\\" (I stopped watching t.v back in 1993).  Up-to-that-point, my favorite S.F. series was (deservedly) \\"Babylon 5\\".  Once I saw 'Serenity' I was an immediate & nearly obsessed fan.  I watched it 3 times the first day (it was winter & I was sick) & twice the next day.  Within a week, I had the entire series & I watched nothing else until I had enjoyed the series 7 times thru (yeh; I kno--I kno....).  In-my-defense tho, I have yet to purchase any books, shirts, or trinkets, as such.  However, tomorrow is another day....  :)  Yes, I know (it's pathetic) &, I fully accept that view-point even tho it is criticism, because, it's pretty much true.  Joss (& everyone involved) did such a superb top-notch job--I was mesmerized!!  I havn't made it to any of the 'Brown-coats' fan parties or to any of the 'cons' (yet) but, one day...  For all of my 51 years, I have been a great fan of Star Trek, & other S.F. (genre) & personally, I enjoyed \\"Firefly\\" & \\"Serenity\\" more-so than all previous movies or series, by leaps-&-bounds!!

B000FBFMFW|5.0|In a land and time far far away,live Fritz the bastard. How I love this boy. His soul is pure. His values honest. His wolf sincere. The dialog is of the time and period and got me hooked right away. The imagery haunts me in my sleep, yet I do not have the Skill although I sometime feel I have the Wit connection with my cat. These books are a delightful read. A great way to escape!

B007FG9LIE|2.0|Buyer beware!  The book description said nothing about this being a sci-fi type of book.  If it had I would have avoided it completely as I am not into the post apoplectic genre.  The Pines started out ok and seemed to have promise.  But when the true course of the book was revealed I was disappointed in the misleading description.  Not at all a book I would recommend.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Good leaders never take credit from the others.  Of course, we have President Obama who lies since day 1.  As soon as I heard the news about the death of Osama Bin Laden, I knew that he would use this as his advantage.  No surprise at all.<br /><br />I understood why the author didn't go through the apporval process before publishing this book.  'Cos under Obama administration, this book will never come out while he is still in office.<br /><br />It is very clear in the book that it is teamwork to get the job done.  Everybody has 100% trust of the others will do their part right in order to come out of the war alive.  I guess you got to have \\"9 lives\\" to survive such a lot of deployments.  People like Owen and his teammates should take all the credit of this mission.  But a few of them, including Owen, thought that they failed because they didn't have enough time to go through everything of the intelligence and Bin Laden's compound.  It just show how humble they are and should have more respect from every one of us.<br /><br />I cried several times while I was reading this book.  Not many human beings can go through the intense training, not to mention about the combats and how the outcome would affect these warriors for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />I have more respects of the men and women who sacrifice and give up so much to fight for our freedom and fix the wrong to right.  Many of us take it for granted every day.  We, including myself, complain how tough life is.  But after reading this book, it means nothing at all.<br /><br />Thank you for writing this book.  Most of all, THANK YOU for all the men and women who fought and fight for our freedom.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was totally hooked from book one through book three. I enjoyed that the book progressively leaned towards discovering more about Christians past, and didn't leave you hanging. I also enjoyed the drama thrown in to keep it exciting. It was definitely a love story demonstrating unconditional love....baggage and all.<br />Hope you'll consider writing another love story trilogy with characters as endearing as Ana and Christian. I'm going to miss them!!!
B005JE7XW0|4.0|This movie was much better and much funnier than it had any right to be thanks to the solid performances of the two lead actors.

B008578PMU|1.0|Music was just bad, acting ok( seen better and seen worse ), and the writing not good, all the speeches just kinda dropped off leaving you hanging.
B007SGM084|5.0|At times this book was a little much to take, especially the first book but as the story evolved, it was much better.  I hope to see another trilogy like this for women.  This is the most talked about book I have read ever and most of the talk is favorable.  An \\"I can't put it down\\" book.
B007SGM084|4.0|[[ASIN:B007SGM084 Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle: Fifty Shades of Grey; Fifty Shades Darker; Fifty Shades Freed]]<br />I knew quite a few women who had read these three books and kept recommending them. I finally downloaded to my kindle and ended up reading straight through the entire series in about a week.  I'm sure you have already heard all the hype if you are reading this. I want to add that the story line is very good and well written.  I think this would actually make for an excellent and serious book group discussion on relationships.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's great and i recommend this to first time users. Then once they think they have this game beat they should become a member of AngryBirdsNest.com. You can post your scores on there and see how good you really are.

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie was quite exciting!  The acting was good and the makeup was interesting. The action was the best part. The hunt scenes were suspenseful.
B0086DBE62|4.0|This movie was enjoyable, but could have been done better. I was disappointed in Julia Roberts role. She is such a great actress and I have loved everything she has done except this one role. She was not convincing enough to pull off the evil stepmother/witch role. Everything else about the movie was pretty good. This is not a movie for very young children.
B0000057C5|5.0|Cd is in bran new condition, I love the music. Its my new Metallica :D I love this type of \\"metal\\", the heavy industrial riffs, the lyrics.
B000FC2ROU|4.0|Started to read this book while I was at home one day and could not put it down!  Dropped everything on hand and read through lunch and at night for hours until I finished the entire book.  You can never expect what will happen next in this book but it is not like any random events that might lead readers to confusions. Very creative and sometimes philosophical.  Loved it!
B000001EJ8|3.0|This is a nice selection of songs and it could be a very good complement to the album Themes for a \\"best of ...\\" collection. But if you want to upload this into your Ipod, beware of the annoying mixing of tracks together in many of the tracks. Well, even if you want to listen the CD in a different order, this feature will ruin the whole listening experience.
B007TML4EI|4.0|Dummy Defense is a very clever and addictive game. It can be frustrating trying to keep the boulders and bombs and hammers from hurting the poor \\"dummy\\", but it is rewarding when he remains unharmed from these threats.<br /><br />The app works reasonably well on a the original Samsung Galaxy Tab 7\\" running Gingerbread.  My only complaint is that the pinch and zoom and move features are sluggish or non-responsive at times.
B00571F26Y|5.0|The title is misleading. This great book explains much more about wheat and health than just weight loss. For example, I finally understand how a cupcake made with wheat flour can trigger a killer migraine headache! There is lots of science explained in the statesments made by the author. I have this book in hard cover, audio and on my kindle so that I can referrence anything in it where ever I go. I will play the audio when we travel, just to remind me not to stop at  any fast food places. This is a book for anyone who cares about themselves, has an interest in how our modern foods affect us and what we can do to make things better, one reader at a time!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It will change the way you think of war and the people who make sacrifices to keep us safe. This is a must read.
B005544V6A|3.0|I get tired of these story lines that forever have nothing but corporate bad guys. How about some stories built around inter corporate legal  problems.  The basic idea of this series is good, but how in the world can they make any money if all they do is sit around waiting to help some poor slob who's been  victimized by who knows who. Also, I would get rid of the manager. She doesn't seem to realize her job is to keep the firm profitable - not  assigning  her top lawyers to charity cases. In fact I don't see her doing much of anything, but try an look important.<br /><br />However I do feel the  series  has great potential If you can bring  little Law & Order realism to the story line.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|4 adults and 2 children went to see this. We bought the Meridia doll for the oldest girls birthday and then we went to see the movie. The story needed more depth, even for an animated movie. The 5 year old loves movies and she told me she was expecting more. She said Grammy I like the doll better.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was great. After 50 shades this book was just as tantalizing. Cannot wait for the next one to cone out.
B006GHA9VQ|3.0|The voices are excellent and some of the songs memorable. I am a great fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber but  this is not even close to his best musical. The story is very dark and does not tie in with The Phantom of The Opera.  To be a \\"sequel\\" it should follow the previous story and this does not do that.  I did enjoy the fact that it was a theater production and not a movie.
B00005KK9M|5.0|Fans......to argue which record is better is a waste of time! Both are great rock albums that mirror each other in greatness. With few flaws its just a question of taste which songs you like better.Now i can see \\"Dust in the Wind\\" stays within the musical context of what they had been doing all along.They did not sell out they reached thier peaks with \\"Leftoverture\\" and \\"Point of no Return\\" amazing records with a musical theme that runs through both giving mental imagages just you when you see those cd covers!  Magical! Not a big fan of the violin but as Tull did with the flute incorporates just enough and little to where you don't notice anymore. But don't be mistaken..this music is unique and excecuted by fantastic musicians with unbelievabe results...*****
B00002DE4E|5.0|This is a band that many have and love in the world. Started from a small label, Factory, England have won the whole world. And not for the death of Ian Curtis, but because they had opened new doors to the white wave, that sounds cool in a punk. Many wondered why Ian Curtis killed himself, who said drug, epilessia.Nothing of this.. Ian was a sad person, married and his wife had managed to get rid<br />of that sadness. The only solution for Ian was to disappear for ever from his sadness. I wonder ifin heaven will he be happy?
B005CMSDLE|4.0|The movie focuses on a young girl who is trained by her adoptive father in the wilds of Finland named Hanna to be a ruthless killing machine, who was genetically engineered by the CIA. Her mother killed by the woman in-charge of the project is Hanna's first target. She escapes the CIA's facility and goes off intent on making it to where her adoptive father is, meeting up with a family in Morrocco on vacation. She then learns that she is different from everyone else, that she's fastest and with better if not greater reflexes. She eventually kills the woman who killed her mother, grandmother, and adoptive father. A movie loaded with action and suspense that'll keep you at the edge of your seat.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was a good book. I had a hard time not comparing it to Fifty Shades. I have already preordered the next book.
B0045HCJT4|5.0|Kurt Russell plays Sgt. Todd a soldier who was chosen at birth and trained to be a stone cold heartless killing machine until one day while facing off against the next generation of genetically engineered soldiers, he is beleived killed and disposed of on a planet of garbage. Todd finds on the planet people from a transporter ship that crashed who now call it home, and as he lives with them they help him unearth something he never knew he had, his soul. Todd spends his time with them eating, gardening, training and looking back on his life and slowly realizes with each passing moment that his life has been a travesty of people he killed because they either got in the way or he never thought about them at all because he had orders to hide behind. But Todd is looked at as too dangerous by their captain and is banished, as he sits by the fire, he cries wondering if the soul he had. The one buried in spent shell casings, shrapnel, blood, tears, sweat and the filth of combat had been sold. Sold to a lie. The genetically engineered soldiers come to the planet for a training exercise and are ordered to kill any inhabitants because their considered hostile, and Todd springs into action. The new soldiers are faster, stronger, and have unbelivable endurance but their not smarter as Todd uses his knowledge of the planet and its geography to beat them back. Then he faces off against the leader of the soldiers, Caine in a climatic battle of where Todd demonstrates that Cain maybe his better physically but he never learned to mind his surroundings. But the scene that amazes all is at the end when Nathan walks up to Todd, and with little to no ceremony he adopts Todd by putting his arms out so Todd can pick him up. His meaning to Todd is he needs a dad, his mom needs a new man, and Todd could use them to help make him more human. A great Sci-fi film.

B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is great; easy to make coins, invite friends, play with dragons, and even crossbreed. But the one thing that's missing is the goals. The goals are helpful with the rewards; coins, gold, and experience points usually. But this game has none. That's why I prefer monster story over dragon story; its just like dragon story but with monsters and goals.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Enjoyed my time with Harold Fry. The author did a great job of painting the picture of every character.  There are many who are introduced for short periods, but you will connect with and they stay with you for the entire trip.  Found myself \\"needing\\" to pick this book up to keep pace with Harold's journey.
1402790546|5.0|Bomber Command sought to defeat Germany by destroying its industry. They declined to attack German tanks or their supply chain invading Belgium and France. They denied resources to Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain and won the<br />dismissal of its commander immediately after he saved the world from the Nazis. The bombers proved incapable of targeting and damaging German factories so \\"strategic bombing\\" became the incineration of cities. Studies showed no clear indication that the effort hastened victory in Europe by one day. The best rationalization for the campaign, after the fact, was that raids tied down ten thousand flak guns and one hundred thousand gunners who could have fought the tanks of the Red Army. The obvious explanation for the campaign is British fury to make the German people suffer for their war. The only good thing to say about any of it is that tens of thousands of educated people determined that nothing like it would ever happen again and it hasn't. Len Deighton's novel, written at the same time as Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, like that book also addressing the United States bombardment of our ally the Republic of Viet Nam, shows one raid from the air and from the ground.
1582701709|5.0|I was introduced to the power of The Secret back in May through the DVD. I began applying the techniques from the DVD immediately after watching.  Just weeks later, things that I had been asking for my whole life began to appear. I bought this little book and began studying even more about The Secret. This book and the DVD are an overview to THE MOST POWERFUL and important spiritual law, The Law of Attraction. This is a powerful, omnipresence that works in your life every day whether you are aware of it or not. The premise is that what you think about, you attract into your life. You are introduced to the power that thought and feeling have over your success and happiness. The Secret book and DVD provide a high level analysis of The Law of Attraction but there is much to be uncovered beyond this book and DVD.<br /><br />Read this book and apply the techniques suggested immediately! Read the works of other teachers and historic figures mentioned in the book. Things began to change for me immediately and I have only been moving forward. My finances were the first thing to change. I already have more money with even MORE on the way! Im sleeping better, doing better at work and I have a new business idea every day! Im meeting people that are at my disposal to help me achieve all kinds of goals. It's very exciting and I'm more grateful at every turn! Once you read the book and watch the DVD, watch some of Bob Proctor's videos on the other spiritual laws and get in harmony with them AT ONCE!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a well written action story with thorough character development and unique circumstances and climaxes. In other words...you want to see what happens next with the people you feel you really know because the ultimate conclusion is not predictable.

B000F3UAFC|4.0|This loose modernization of the Wilde play \\"Lady Windermere's Fan\\" could have been even better.  The ingredients are all there (a cleverly deceptive plot, brilliant dialogue, excellent actors, fantastic locations) and yet something is missing.  For me it's the vital chemistry among the actors, and the casting is partly to blame.  Also, both the female leads would have benefited from more flattering camera angles and stronger direction, as they seemed reluctant to inject much personality into the roles of two devastatingly alluring women.  Helen Hunt gave an anaemic and overly depressed performance, and was simply not believable as a career mistress who had been the luxuriously-kept darling of the wealthiest men in New York.  Scarlett Johansson sleepwalked through the entire movie wearing the same sulky expression and surprisingly failed to convey the intriguing duality of her part.  Mark Umbers, an English actor, was awkwardly cast as an American;  he did his best but was hampered by said lack of chemistry with the main female characters.<br /><br />On the positive side, Stephen Campbell-Moore gave an elegant and utterly convincing performance as a charming but slightly dissolute aristocrat.  John Standing was delightful as the slightly squiffy socialite.  Milena Vukotic provided many hilarious moments with a perfectly straight face.  In fact, all the supporting characters gave very good performances, but the stand-out was undoubtedly Tom Wilkinson who routinely stole every scene he was in.  What saved this film was a seemingly inexhaustible supply of Oscar Wilde's epigrams which ran like a bubbling stream throughout the play.  In fact it was almost overdone, as nearly all of Wilde's famous quips seem to have been utilized, many harvested from his other material.<br /><br />The play urges society to take an honest look at how narrow-minded attitudes and malicious gossip can wreak havoc with innocent people's lives when \\"circumstantial evidence\\" is taken at face value, and also how sometimes the truth can hurt more than a discreet obfuscation of past events.  It also shows how someone with a bad reputation can rise above a blemished past and achieve redemption through an act of noble self-sacrifice.  Anyone familiar with Wilde's life will recognize his personal knowledge of  these themes, however, in his inimitable style he makes his points through humour rather than by preaching.  Another excellent reason to watch this production is the visual feast of the villa interiors and the beautifully photographed Amalfi location.  I have deducted a star because of the uneven cast, but that has not stopped me from watching this DVD several times already and, to me, the brilliant dialogue alone would justify a purchase.e, and also how sometimes the truth can hurt more than a discreet obfuscation of past events.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter is one of those inexplicable anomalies in the film world: a brilliant, well-crafted science-fantasy epic that was given virtually no marketing, thereby dooming it to poor box office returns domestically while breaking re ords left and right in the overseas markets. There's no point in my going into Disney's clumsy mishandling of John Carter (beginning with the perplexing decision to drop \\"of Mars\\" from the title) as that story will be far better served in Michael Sellers' soon-to-be released book, John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood. Nor shall I rehash other reviewers' synopses of John Carter. All I should say here as a fan of the original Edgar Rice Burroughs book series since the 1960's is this film adaptation, even with its scripters' decision not to adhere 100% to the original story, is absolutely a must-have sleeper classic that not only deserves to be on everyone's Christmas list this year, but also the two (at least) sequels that were originally planned by its creators. Ï pre-ordered it as soon as it became available and even went so far as to get the \\"all the bells and whistles\\" version even though I don't own a 3D television.....yet.

B004LWZW6K|2.0|As my title said \\"horrible\\" Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd returns in minor roles the only part I liked is when Rhames has the shotgun legs and when I first thought Gary Busey would have a big part but no (SPOILER!!! he is eaten at the very begining) this is a definite insult to the franchise.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The last book in the Fifty Shades Triology was a satisfying end for me.  James is a new author and will learn to stay away from some of the repetitious words that became annoying like \\"smirked\\" and \\"whispered\\" and \\"the shy smile\\".  Ok, we get it, but they don't have to repeated constantly.  Overall though, the storyline was enjoyable and she can write an erotic scene for sure.  I would love to see the entire triology re-written from Christian's viewpoint.  Good job James!

I loved the era in which it was set in, and the costumes, which suited Robert perfectly. I felt so sad for Georges (Rob's) character of Georges, as I feel he was driven to become the ruthless man he became. Totally loved Bel Ami!

B0001I55SS|4.0|Following up on the success of Star Wars, Paramount and Disney had took their turns for their own big budget sci-fi epics. \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\", and \\"The Black Hole\\". Fox followed up in the interim before \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" with their horror-scifi classic \\"Alien\\". Even Warner Brothers gave a semi-sci-fi effort with \\"Superman\\" and the unforgettable opening sequences.And TV had \\"Battlestar Galactica\\". We'll probably never see that kind of line-up of thought provoking steadily paced movies of sci-fi wonder that gave the audience time to look around again. \\"The Black Hole\\" had great story concepts even if the script falls short yet there are so many more positives that can't help outweigh and give a great trip \\"in, through and beyond!\\" With probably the greatest sci-fi scores of all time of those movies by John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, and John Barry. Barry's score for \\"The Black Hole\\" is a unique unforgettable ultimately \\"swirling\\" effective four note-plus majestic motif of doom and might, a theme that's just as good and rousing as William's intro theme for \\"Jaws\\". As well as astounding secondary themes and cues. The effects and production besides the lasers were completely classic old-school modelling and matte painting. All the stars in the space background were hand painted. As unfair to the unparalleled \\"Lord of the Rings\\" bringing up the mention of the \\"Dwarf tossing joke\\" , like the individually hand painted stars in \\"the Black Hole\\", each ring of chain mail was individually handmade and hooked together by hand by two guys in the Weta studio. Combined with the impressive visuals, the sinister \\"devil-red\\" Maximillian, the magnicifent \\"Romantic\\" Cygnus, and the stellar veteran cast; Yvette Mimieux was the Eloi \\"Weena\\" in the classic sci-fi 50's \\"The Time Machine\\". And \\"Norman Bates\\" gets a comeuppance before \\"Psycho 2\\". Amazingly, it's Maximillian who wins out as the most diabolical and creepy of the villainy roundtable this turn. \\"The Black Hole\\" deserves it's place among those big sci-fi giants of those few last years of the 70's. Voices for the floating bots were Slim Pickens(\\"Dr. Strangelove\\") as Bob and Roddy McDowell(\\"Cornelius\\"&\\"Caesar\\" from the Planet of the Apes movies) as Vincent. An Asimovian and Disney-fied idea of cute robots you can certainly trust your kids with and a lot more effective character-wise than anything we saw in the fresh prince's trashed and dumped \\"I-Robot\\".
0785153322|3.0|The books are beautiful, fantastic and impressive. However, the packaging is sub-standard as the outer carton is twice the size of the actual book and the books could rock within. The book casing for the 4 books is cracked at the corners. Luckily the 4 books inside are OK. Not lethal but it hurts even before I could start reading it. What a waste, sigh ...
B008MG1E4A|2.0|The hype around this book was just that. Granted, anyone who takes an oath of silence regarding military operations should take that oath seriously, and no matter how much they feel they need to clear the air, just simply shut up.<br />The book is nothing more than one man's experience in the war on terror, and anyone can watch these training scenarios play out on Discovery channel or History channel.<br />Comical to hear the one line comment on the VP, but even that was uncalled for in print.<br />After 28 years in the service, I would have to say I have read much better, more detailed books, and would simply recommend picking a copy of this up at a garage sale in a few weeks.
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|I follow Amazon's Artists on the Rise every month, and without a doubt Nick Waterhouse is my favorite musician ever featured. Amazon provided \\"Is That Clear\\" for free and the song was amazing. The rest of the album is just as great, no filler at all. The album may be short, but it is well worth the price, though I understand if you may wish to wait until it is on sale again. I already can't wait for his next album, I will no doubt buy it the second it is released.

B008M0UTRO|5.0|This was a perfect description of Japan in the 60's. Studio Ghibli doesn't disappoint their audiences with such an unraveling story that i had to watch it back to back. It was that good. Anyways if your looking forward to this being released in the US then you should buy this first just to try it out. The subtitles are pretty slow at times so if your a beginner then this is perfect for you. Goro Miyazaki didn't do such a bad job, this reminds me of Whisper of the Heart. If your a Ghibli fan and you wanna see a sneak peek then purchase this cause the current price of 15 bucks is a good buy.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Annual watching and find myself ever more perplexed that this show, the best of the Whedon's in my HO, was axed by an undiscerning network.  Especially in light of all the irritating and vacuous reality shows that get money pumped into them. Can't decide if the show's genius is that the elusive and rich characterisations were hinted at and never quite realised.  Having said this I can't help contemplating that Angel and Buffy finished beautifully but, in my opininon, the writing team were powerful enough that they could have continued to emotionally and intellectually plumb the story for years without hitting a dry note (particularly Angel with the intro of the Spike/Angel dynamic in the last season).  In the absence of reality as I know it I can't conceive of a world where I wouldn't have been an ardent fan of an ongoing Firefly series.  However, I am guilty of never watching anything on regular tv (ads are so irritating) and only watch dvds.  But, hello network of 2003, you failed to appreciate the changing world where there are heaps like me who revel in dvd (ad free) releases.  I just had to post my deep sense of narrative incompletion that the Serenity movie just doesn't quite satisfy (still loved it though).  Firefly truly was a \\"story with scope\\" but I will always feel like I'm forever looking through a lens fixed permanently on only a tiny part of a rich landsacape.  This makes me feel gloomy because nearly ten years have passed and most of the actors have moved on to other successful parts (Castle, Homeland, Suits, Chuck) and the unique chemistry they develoepd is now lost forever.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very easy read. The story line keeps you intrigued to keep reading book after book. Wish there would be another one in the series.

B000022TSH|4.0|In the Raymond Chandler tradition, Jack Nicholson portrays an excellent spin-off character of that era.<br /><br />While investigating misaligned marriages, the private eye stumbles onto murder and mass corruption at the Los Angeles' water and power company. John Huston plays the top dog; as family head and the influence under the silent partnerships that motivate murder. Faye Dunaway provides the romantic lure angle.<br /><br />Good entertainment value for this genre.
B007UPNA6Y|1.0|After reading this latest Jack Reacher book I wonder if Lee Child really wrote the bulk of the story. It just seems too geeky and certainly much too slow for what we have come to expect from Reacher novels. Certainly I would class this as the worst of the series, and if there is another planned with the same geek-speak, I would rather leave Reacher at this point, thumbing his way to Virginia.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|The TV reviews were pretty good.  I do not particularly like Clooney as a actor.  I have to say that his acting in this carried the the story through to an appropriate ending.  He  was able to deal with the adversities and complexities of his life in managing his wife's life ending accident, her infidelity, his two daughters whom he did know but was able to bring into control with genuine affection and love.  The extened family was typical - scoundrels, lazy, eccentric, average but all greedy and not supportive of his situation as family curator of a magnificent land trust.  He was strong but not overbearing.  It was a movie with a point but actually very relaxing to watch.  Am sending it on to my daughter and her family.  Yes, I was surprised that I appreciated it so much.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved these books. I hope there are more to come !! I'm glad I my friend talked me into reading these. Leaves you wanting more!!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|After hearing a few songs on Pandora from this CD I decided to purchase it, and was not disappointed. Great music.
0307744434|5.0|When I finished reading this book for the first time, I thought something akin to \\"Surely my impressions have been distorted by exhaustion and lack of food. I've never been this into a book in my entire life.\\" And then I started reading it again. Not all of it, mind. The plot was enough to hold my attention for one go-round, but I didn't need to see any more of the characters. No, I wanted to see the circus again, read the description of its inception, the clock, the tents, the aura of elegance and mystery surrounding the entire experience which is the Circus of Dreams. For me, the entire book was about the setting. Like the very best science fiction, the story seems to be only an excuse to introduce readers to the world, and I am hopelessly in love with this world.<br /><br />That said, the character development is on the slight side, which contributes to the overall sense of the world as a dream-like place -- only certain details and events are deemed significant, and they are highlighted. The style of the narrative, which shifts not only between characters, but also temporally, can be difficult to follow at times, but lends itself readily to a relatively equal treatment of characters' sub-plots.<br /><br />I quite look forward to seeing if Morgenstern's subsequent efforts can match the brilliance of her debut.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I can certainly relate to the issues covered in this book. As long as I follow the plan, my skin clears up and my pains improve. If I \\"cheat\\" I know it. I wish the well written technical part in the front was not so much of the book and that there were more recipes. The ones I have used were surprisingly good. I look forward to his cookbook. I started with the printed version and then bought a Kindle version to make it easier to shop for unusual (to me) ingredients.
B000HAB4KS|3.0|Pretty good. I waited until just now to watch these movies. It wasn't bad but I'm glad I didn't go to the movies and pay ticket prices for it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|simple to play with easy to read graphics on the tiles.  like the fact that your time dictates your score and that every board &quot;wins.&quot;  a nice added feature might be how many moves remain.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Product seems to crash often on my Kindle fire for most video downloads. Also, the few times I ask to download just the MP3, I got errors when I try to play them. I'll probably uninstall this product and wait for an updated version.
B0056BMK6K|2.0|If you think you'll get to know how he really did it you won't get your answer.But if you want to know how awesome thig guy is you will be pleased.Apart from the 90 percent of the book that sells the author and his books and characters there are some util advises on the use of social networks and marketing through them.Hence the 2 stars as i reserve the 1 star to the complete BS and outrageous scams.<br /><br />He also doesnt mention at all the paid reviews he paid thousand for to cheat the Amazon system.Just very low.
B009329ZF2|3.0|I avoided this movie from the start. It looked inane and truly absurd. But, like the first Transformers movie, it turned out to have been well-crafted and, despite being mostly predictable, had enough twists and fun details to make it quite worthwhile. Great movie? Of course not, and don't expect any kind of grand message or socially relevant anything. But, it was more entertaining than it had any right to be.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|A good movie that seems to be very true to the book. I am anxious to see if the next one is this well done.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Excellent sequel to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  I didn't expect this book to be as good as the first in the trilogy, but I ended up thinking it was even better!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The reason that I titled my review as such, is because I can't believe some of the negative reviews because the author supposedly had an ax to grind with the President. There were about 2 1/2 paragraphs critical of the President. There were about the same number that were complimentary towards the President. There was much more time and space dedicated to the author's opinion that both parties should be ashamed of using this mission for their own behalf politically. The rest of the book was about the author's career as a SEAL. Of course, the highlight is certainly his version of the mission that captured OBL. I felt the book wasn't poorly written, but there were a few editorial errors on the kindle version. My recommendation is to read the book and make the decision yourself. I was able to finish it entirely in about six hours.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The trilogy just keeps getting better! A great finale to Stieg Larsson's trilogy. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the earlier books in the trilogy.  Each story just gets better than the previous.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Lots of hype about this book. Found it well-written, easy to follow.  The White House and the Pentagon may not want this book out there, but am sure about one thing:  If the SEALs didn't want it out it wouldn't be out.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a challenging but not impossibly frustrating game. It is also visually pleasing and relaxing to play. Well done, developers, your technical efforts and artistry are appreciated.
1588167461|5.0|This is a great general guide to style. It's also a pretty good style guide in a more in-depth sense. It's nothing ground breaking but for the price it was a nice purchase. My only true gripe about this book is I felt it could have used a few more actual pictures instead of illustrations. The book has a nice attractive appearance and I like the textured cover. The black and purple is a nice and has a classy touch to it. While I do wish it had a few more pictures, I am happy I bought it, the hygiene areas covered were particular nice I felt. Even though it doesn't cover anything most men concerned with style wouldn't know, it is a great touch up and reference book. Full of nice tips and a great purchase.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Les Miz is my favorite stage production. To be able to relive it any time I want is a joy. I highly recommend this video.
1409136612|5.0|Short and sweet.  Quick read enjoyed by myself and members of my family. Authors death is a great loss.  I'll miss her books.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|After reading the amazon reviews I thought i would chance it and buy the book anyway, it had to make the top 100 somehow, i was pleasantly suprised.. The sex scenes did become a bit to frequent but overall it was not a bad read, i would reccomend it to females ages 20-30
B008EEB4TA|5.0|It's very rare for me to find a whole album that I enjoy listening to. Marina & the Diamonds have created two albums that I absolutely adore. Electra Heart is catchy, addictive, and just plain incredible. I adore this artist because she writes and sings about that are relevant to modern society. It's nice to listen to something that has meaning, rather than the usual nonsensical crap.
0316123587|5.0|it is a quick read but i think it is a great souvenir from the show,im going to miss all those from season 3. i cant wait til season 4 starts. my book came in great condition not a single flaw.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Non stop action keeps you interested .Keeps you entertained to the end.Have read others in the series ,now is time to start at the beginning.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its very very very helpful.And awesome.Its the best.You should make more like this,its the best.I think u should also try to improve it a little bit
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|This book was not at all what I expected.  I should have sent a sample to my kindle before buying.  I didn't even realize it was a young adult book until I started reading it.  Not that I'm opposed to young adult books,  some of them are pretty entertaining.  This one however not so much.  I found it a chore to finish.  The ending doesn't even make sense to me.  So I suggest passing it up and reading something else.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great read! Couldn't but it down. Would not recommend for reader's under 25 yrs old.<br />Might be a little to \\"juicy\\".
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief has been a favorite of mine.  I recommend it to anyone who asks for a good book to read.  It gives you a look back into time and perspective of some of what the people were going thru.  What you had to do to survive.  It's a good book with good characters and it's a novel in which you can learn something.  I recommend that you read it and that you have your children read it.  It's a wonderful thing when you can learn a lesson from a book.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was awesome! My wife and I went to see it in the theater but my 8 month old son was being very loud so I had to take him out and I missed most of the movie. I was glad when it finally came out on blu-ray so i could watch the whole thing. It was a great movie. Very interesting and creative plot and story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the site and love the app!!! It is easy to use and I prefer to use my kindle fire instead of my laptop!
B005QMOZOO|3.0|If you enjoyed Jane Austen and likes detective stories, you may very well enjoy this novel. Of course, it is not written by Jane Austen, hence a different style.
B001A3CP5Y|5.0|Great music!  Dylan is wonderful. Wonderful combination.  A really fun CD.<br /><br />This is a must have for anyones colletion.  It is much better than Volume II.
B008VBYN80|4.0|not bad not bad at all u battle you build buildings. but stuff cost diamonds a lot of diamonds and that costs money that's y I gave it 4 stars
B008KPDYQY|2.0|I've never written a review on Amazon before. I can't say much about this film other than for what should be a knockout comedic cast, it is amazingly boring and slow. I think the director imagined the humor would be found in the characters' quirky, offbeat dialogue, except the dialogue isn't funny or quirky. It's like watching the life of two semi-funny people, minus any interesting parts. I want my 3.99 back.
1596432594|5.0|I am a middle school life science teacher, who this year will also be teaching Physical Science.  I have used graphic novels in my classes for years:  Jay Hosler has some wonderful titles which the students enjoy reading 10 times better than the textbook (and get the same, if not better, information.)  So, I was looking for a great graphic novel for my physical science honors students, and I came across \\"Feynman.\\"  I bought it for myself to preview it, and found it perfect - great information in an engaging format.  I've written a grant for a class set for my students, and I just know they will love it.
0345803507|4.0|From Reading and Writing Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance<br /><br />At a Glance<br />I tried to stay away from the negative reviews of this series as I read it. I think I enjoyed the series more for that reason. However, before I started reading the last book, Fifty Shades Freed, I broke down took a peek at a few negative reviews. Sadly, it made this book less enjoyable. I started noticing things that bothered other people so they started bothering me, too. I still loved this book, but it did lose some of its flare because of outside influence.<br /><br />The Good<br />Here's the Story...<br />Christian and Ana have finally married. Now they get to spend their long honeymoon sharing their love and their bodies. But when they get home, not everything is perfect. Ana and Christian are still trying to figure each other out. Christian is still bossy to a fault and Ana is still too reckless for her own good. Now there is someone who is out to ruin their lives. Someone who holds a grudge and will do anything to bring pain upon Ana and Christian. Can their marriage last despite their stubbornness, despite the person set to destroy them, and despite the surprise that will change their future forever?<br /><br />A Fifty of My Own...<br />The beginning of Fifty Shades Freed really got me excited for the rest of the book. Ana and Christian's honeymoon was simply beautiful. It really made me want to find a rich, sexy, aggressive, bossy, controlling, effed-up man for myself. *giggles* I loved how the book started out alternating from the past and present. While on their honeymoon we get scenes of how the wedding was planned, the actual wedding, and so forth. It was done brilliantly.<br /><br />The \\"Perfect\\" Couple...<br />Ana and Christian are up to their old antics. Their undeniable love for each other is so obvious in every page, but their low points are very low this time around. It made for an emotional read, watching Ana and Christan screw things up in their own ways. There is definitely things that they still have to work on. But even with those bad times, this book is lighter when it comes to the carefree romance and love Ana and Christian share for a good portion of the time. They are one of the cutest couples I have ever seen. They play, they laugh, they enjoy life, even when they are arguing they both try to find ways to lighten the mood. It's mesmerizing to watch.<br /><br />No Longer Fifty Shades, More Like Twenty. It's Called Progress, People...<br />Many people don't like how Christian changed throughout the trilogy. I am on the opposite side of the fence. His transformation from an emotionally messed up control freak to a still bossy but loving and caring husband is the best part of the series. He doesn't lose his edge, he just becomes more well with himself. And Ana is there every step of the way. More power to her because I don't know if I could have handled dealing with a man with these many issues. That's why Ana's sweet, innocent, but strong personality is perfect to help Christian deal with his problems in a healthy way. And yes, Christian's past is completely explored and dealt with in this book.<br /><br />The End...<br />I was very surprised by the unexpected \\"something extra\\" the author decided to throw into the mix near the end. It worked out perfectly, but I truly thought it would ruin everything Ana and Christian had together. Boy was I wrong. And that epilogue is the best part of the whole book. It wraps everything up. I walked away from Fifty Shades Freed with a big, goofy grin on my face. Most satisfying ending ever!<br /><br />The Bad<br />Because I read all those negative reviews, I really noticed some annoying things this time around. The dialogue got really corny sometimes. The whole Mr. Grey/Mrs. Grey thing was so over done I wanted to punch something.<br /><br />Ana's major back and forth between exerting her independence and cowering to Christian was just plain confusing. I felt like Ana was a little bipolar in a lot of her actions. Same with Christian. I didn't see them resolving much of anything until the epilogue.<br /><br />The writing, as always, was not that great. It's really just the story that is interesting. A lack of a solid plot like book one pops up once again. It's a better plot than book one but less so compared to book two.<br /><br />I would also say this book was the most melodramatic. And the repetition really got on my nerves. I so wish James knew how to write a little better because she has some great stories to tell.<br /><br />The Snuggly<br />As always, there is mucho sex. We get a little more kink this time around with the whole butt-play, but it's still not super over top, in my opinion. It comes across as a married couple sexually exploring.<br /><br />Ana and Christian's relationship was probably the most up and down this time around. There were some amazing moments where you can really see the love and adoration. Then there's times when I wanted to slap both of them and tell them they may not be right for each other. But the chemistry was always there, and so was the steam.<br /><br />Overall<br />I don't know what to say. There are so many things wrong with the book, but I just love reading the story. Through my bouts of eye-rolling and laughing at all its hokey glory, I couldn't put the book down. It's like a drug. You know it's bad for you but that doesn't stop you from swallowing every last word. Highly recommended for those who can look past all it's badness and focus on the yummy goodness.<br /><br />Quotes<br />\\"He makes me graceful, that's his skill.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this rather unusual book  - altho I was expecting something a bit more mature reading, this is a book for the younger readers (& I am 60-ish) However that did not stop me from enjoying the story. Its a big hit with a<br />great many fans.
B0080SE0UA|5.0|I downloaded this MP3 Album before I saw THE CULT in Portland at Roseland. They were awesome, and this album/CD totally rocks. It reminds me of their older album/CDs like Sonic Temple. Still the same great guitar and vocals - even better live.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Not yet finished, but up to now it's a page turner. As a layman I learn lots of new things. Should be read by anyone interested in  human communications, psychology and brain functionnalities.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|For me, the first book in the series was phenomenal.  The second book wasn't too bad.  The third book, however, was horrible.  This is the first time I have ever completed a customer review/survey and it is only because I want to warn as many Hunger Fans as I can to stop reading at the end of the second book.  The faults I have with \\"Mocking Jay\\" are chronicled, in detail, on every review site in the world, so I won't go in depth here.  But I will say that I have never seen an author assassinate their characters like this before.  It was such a pity too, because that first book was so good that, in some weird little way, it had an actual affect on me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. I can't stop playing it for long and I am enjoying working on beating my high score on the timed trials. very relaxing and keeps my mind occupied.<br />I enjoy playing against my nieces because it makes them think fast.
1451627297|5.0|It arrives a little late but the book is in very good condition. And it is really a heavy book to read. Anyway I like it
B00563M11M|3.0|I do like Terry Pratchett and this book is okay, but felt something was lacking in the comedy department. The characters and storyline are good (although maybe a little too long) and up to his normal standards. But at best, Snuff managed to get a few sniggers out of me, whereas some of his previous books had me roaring with laughter.<br /><br />I have a feeling that Mr Pratchett maybe getting left behind by some of the up and coming cutting-edge comedy fiction writers, debut books like Tony Royden's [[ASIN:B0079LSUIW The Dealer]] had me wetting myself with laughter.<br /><br />I still think Snuff was an entertaining read, but if like me you are expecting to sit down to a really good laugh, then I fear you may be disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books! I couldn't put down all three once I began reading them!  All three are must reads!
B0028INIWE|5.0|Perfect sampling of their years of music. A must for anyone especially if you don't have any of their music!
B008CP92ZO|4.0|We rented because I wanted to see a comedy.  My husband is more of an action drama guy, but he liked this movie more than he expected. It turns out to be a really cute, funny and more relatable than initially expected love story.

B005L38QHA|2.0|I got this mouse for my birthday (Jan) this year and loved it.  While I have small hands, I'm a tank and have issues reaching beyond 6 on the keyboard with the left hand.  It's slightly uncomfortable and the pinky button is ungodly horrible to use, but the rest worked just fine...until...<br /><br />The button on the left side of the scroll wheel stopped functioning about 3 months after purchase.  You could hear it click, but it wouldn't do anything.  I, unfortunately, had lost my receipt and had paid in cash, so I was unable to return it.  I decided I could work around it, and it worked fine for another month or so, then the right click of the mouse died entirely.<br /><br />Luckily for me, my boyfriend had bought the same mouse and upgraded his to an mmo7.  Again, the mouse worked great, for another couple of months.  Last night, the same button on the left of the scroll wheel died.  Now I'm waiting to see when the right click will die as well.
B000050HTO|4.0|The CD looked like new.  No scratces.  The case was in great shape too.  Everything downloaded onto my computer just fine and onto my MP3.  Thanks
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is truly incredible. So perfect for telling you what exactly is going on with your battery and works so well with the Kindle Fire. I use it all the time and it helps me out a lot. To be honest I feel this app should come installed with the Kindle but since it's not and it's free everyone should definitely get it. You will not regret downloading this app it's a lifesaver.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I learned of this series after seeing the show on HBO. I'm not normally a huge fantasy fan but this was good like Tolkien's good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I became immersed in the story from the beginning.  The story was so interesting that it was really hard to put the book down.  I could feel Katniss' conflicting emotions as she is torn from her family and thrust into  the horrible and terrifying action in the arena. I didn't sleep for two nights, trying to find out what was going to happen next.  It was exhilarating, and now I have to read \\"Catching Fire\\" (Book 2) and \\"Mockingjay\\" (Book 3)!!!!!
030758836X|5.0|This book is so clever that she had me surprised until the end.  I totally disagree with reviewers who say that she didn't know how to end it.  She knew exactly how to end it -- she did not go with anything expected. The pacing of the book is fantastic and to get readers absorbed in unlikable characters says a lot about the author's craft.<br /><br />There's so little you can say about this book without giving something away, so I will just say that I write fiction and usually read non-fiction because there are few surprises out there.  This book is a gem. I wish I wrote it and Gillian Flynn has a fan for life.
0143038419|2.0|Thrilled for this woman that her book was a hit, but god HELP us if she had to juggle kids and a career.  I'm wondering if the fact that it's a 'live vicariousy' read for women is why it was a hit, because most women couldn't possibly have these problems.  I'm also wondering - as she barely addresses it - if perhaps her self-indulgence is what sent her husband packing.  People process pain differently but she's way to absorbed over her loss and I worry she might not have much to offer to children if she can't think outsider her personal box.  Read like a travel diary (eating ice cream in Italy, yawn) but got more interesting as she entered the Ashram with a look into something we woudln't ordinarily know. Glad she found happiness with the new man.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Very entertaining and self-eviscerating look at the \\"coming of age\\" of the celebrity chef.  I am a foodie, and from NYC, but learned quite a bit about food, restaurants, and the food business from this fast read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game, its so fun and its addicting! I use it for the kindle fire and playing on a big screen makes it even better! but, recently the app must have gotten a bug because 'Lep' now moves much faster than he should and he is costing me my lives. also, any tips on how to pass level 9-2?
B0033UDEX4|3.0|You need to view this one again in order to get a complete understanding of the series finale.  If you missed the series opener this is a must.  However, we watched this and are going to have to watch this multiple times in order to understand all that is being said.  If you have a hearing impairment there are no subtitles available to asist you.  You have to turn the volume way up and \\"try\\" to run it back to hear what you missed.  We will probably not get anything else on Amazon Video.  This also happened on a couple of movies we purchased that came with a free digital viewing in a combo-pac.
B008BM9L72|4.0|I found this book very easy to read and you want to read more and more. it is well written, very descriptive and contagious. Really loved it and cannot wait for the movie. Thanks EL James.
B007TML4EI|3.0|a lot of people say that it doesn't work on there kf well all of my games have worked so I don't know what's wrong.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was actually better than I anticipated.  For those who enjoy seeing the underdog come out on top, this is the movie for you.  Also a great movie for all females who feel their is no light at the end of the tunnel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Exhilirating, nail-biting, heart-breaking, drama-packed, and a myriad of other adjectives, The Hunger Games proves a nice book read when a lovable pest known as 'Television' offers nothing to see.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I think Im the wrong person to be writing a review for these two books.  Call me niaive but I had no idea what they were all about.  It didn't take me long to find out...  I found them intriguing if a little heavy on the salacious side.  I just wonder where the author did all that research, given that she is a woman!  I do feel that the two first books could have been combined, and would have been just as intriguing.  Am I going to buy the third book?  You bet I am.<br /><br />Read the books, or you won't be able to join in all the latest conversations!  I just hope I really get to find out what makes the main character tick!  Like I said - intriguing....<br /><br />JC  Maylands W.Australia
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. Navigating the books is easy, and you can chang translations while reading and it stays on the same verse. The only thing I dont like is that you can't download some of the translations like NASB or NIV( but I'm sure that's not the app creators fault.) I just wish that those translations were available as in app purchases or something. That said, there is a wide variety of translations that you CAN download, which is great.
B00932ANQM|1.0|After reading the book, I was looking forward to enjoying the movie..... What a waste of time!  Watched it half way through and turned it off.  What a disappointment!
B002DQDV6Y|3.0|Movie strayed quite a bit from the book, and we found Dumbledore to be less sage and kind in this movie than in the first and second.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|This movie was funny as hell.  If you liked the preview, you'll love the movie.  It has all the aspects of being 'cool at school' and 'dumb cop' types of humor.
B00884GR0W|4.0|still great game some tell me how to craft stuff I like the art but generation in world eh still great
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|This was a total flop of a film--exactly the opposite of the film: [[ASIN:B004RE29PO Aliens [Blu-ray]]]. Nobody worth caring about. Nothing scary at all. Nothing profound. Just shallow, silliness. Nothing exciting even. I won't go into the details as it does not merit my time.
B00913DPW2|5.0|There aren't a whole lot of games. I actually like, but this one is up there! Didn't think it was very scary until I stopped playing after about two hrs-that music really gets to you!  Great graphics on my Sony tablet screen. Can't wait for Haunt2 for android!
0307950689|1.0|Ok, after I wasted my time reading this garbage..I'm wasting more time writing a review...hoping that I could save your time if you are considering reading this...The book starts off very well, but man..what a STUPID plot. Really??? Come on..just pure garbage.
1408215330|5.0|I have been using this dictionary for close to 20 years since I started studying English and I have yet to find a dictionary as good at this one. I own two Websters and a Canadian Oxford, plus the two Oxfords that are on the Kindle and none come near the Longman. Please ELT, create a Kindle version for us!!!!
0345531930|3.0|I would love to review this book, I read about half it on a vacation and when I got home I wanted to finish it.  So why is it the advertised price is $9.99 for the book and $11+ for the Kindle version??  And right on the screen I can see an option to buy it new in paperback for THREE dollars!  Amazon needs to think about pricing ebooks more honestly.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|anyone who loves horror should watch this movie<br />im my opinion its the greatest horror movie ever made.<br />i highly recommend this movie.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|This season was as great as always. I have to wait on season 7 now, since I do not have showtime. Can't wait!
0345803485|2.0|I can't believe this is the most selling book on Amazon, I think other authors should be offended.  True, I read both books,  (wasn't interested enough in reading the third one) and felt  kind of  intrigued by  Christian's character, because he is  sick but sexy, however, I think it sets a bad example to see this type of \\"pleasure\\" as something normal.  I prefered book 2 of the trilogy, because Christian is more sensitive and you can understand why he is that way.  The heroin of the story, \\"what's her name\\", is weak and not even memorable, has no  dignity nor self respect, didn't like her at all.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Simply a great game&hellip;single player but fun passing back and forth to see who can get the highest score. One of the very few games I recommend.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read the story in a week.  I was more impressed by the author's way of writing than the story itself.  It showed raw emotion that gave me goosebumps. I liked that Camille Parker, the \\"heroin\\" of the story is someone sick and twisted marked by torments of the past,  I think it made her a unique character, full of mystery but also you can see her as a sensible and sad person.<br />If you want goosebumps, mystery and a sick ending this is definitely the story  where to find it.
B008VBYN80|5.0|this is a fun game. I lose track of time when I play it.  the only thing I dint like is having to buy diamond you should be able to earn them.

B008BIN9EW|1.0|Uninstalled due to complete disinterest. The tutorial was a bore and the first game or two were even worse. I regret wasting the resources to download this utter mediocrity.
0385742886|5.0|Right up front this book is very depressing but if you are a fan of the Maze Runner trilogy you will most likely enjoy The Kill Order. New characters and lots of fast paced action and adventure will have you finishing this book in no time at all. I wouldn't reccomend it for younger readers though as it tends to get a little violent.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|Its all a bit repetitive and predictable. She disobeys him, he gives her a good seeing too, she's always very wet! Blah, Blah, Blah
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I have watched all of the Jessie Stone films and remain convinced that \\"Stone Cold\\" is the best. Tom Selleck performs superbly in the role of small town police chief with psychological problems produced by an unfaithful wife who drove him to drink and caused him to lose his job as a Los Angeles police detective. Stone travels to the seaport of Paradise on the Atlantic Coast where his impressive skills as a detective are tested by a series of apparently motiveless killings. I have admired Tom Selleck's acting more as his years advanced and I await each annual production of a Jessie Stone story with keen anticipation. The acting by the killers is frighteningly chilling. Some minor quibbles. Why can't they find attractive women closer to Selleck's age (late sixties) as romantic interests, such as the gorgeous Mimi Rogers whom we do not see often enough nowadays, rather than produce romantic interests for him who are all clearly young enough to be his daughters. The adorable Alexis Dziena as a 16 year old victim of sexual violence is an impressive actress and obviously has a great acting career ahead of her. I thoroughly enjoyed the incident in Stone's office when her father meted out some fatherly justice to the lead rapist and his obnoxious father. Speaking as a former prosecuting attorney, I would never have agreed to the lead rapist receiving community service and being allowed to return to the girl's school. The alternatives should have been either a different school or juvenile detention. Did anyone notice the continuity glitch when Chief Stone's pal Abby came to grief on a sunny morning in what appears to be a park. Next scene is at night in Stone's home when he is disturbed by an intruder outside the house (the killers). The next scene is back to Abby in the park and it is morning again.
0374214913|4.0|There are a lot of appealing aspects to this book.  It's a book about books, technology, secret societies, code breaking; it's a mystery and it's funny.<br /><br />I think this book will appeal to fans of Jasper Fforde, Chirstopher Moore and Matt Ruff.  It hangs on the edge of reality and a certain amount of disbelief must be suspended; but it is FUN!<br /><br />There was a lot of creativity and if the author keeps coming up with ideas like this, he has a bright future.  I found the writing occassionaly stiff, but not to a degree that it diminished the story and I felt the first half of the book was stronger than the second.  Overall, it is a strong debut and I think a book that booklovers will really enjoy.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is very easy to follow and each chapter brings it's own surprises, which really adds to the overall experience. I'm delighted the book cam in to my radar via the Kindle store. I look forward to watching the movie after finishing the first book.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Camille Preaker has secrets.  Dark thoughts and feelings cause her to hurt herself.  She is a cutter.<br /><br />Back in Chicago after treatment, she is starting over.  As a reporter.  Her mentor, Curry, and his wife Eileen are parental figures in a way.  But Curry is also her boss, so he is sending her off to get a story in Wind Gap, MO, her hometown.  Her familiarity with the landscape might help her in this quest.  It could also do her in.<br /><br />For back in Wind Gap lies the root of her pain and her problems.  Her family.<br /><br />But Camille is determined to get the story.  So she goes, and she faces it all with sheer bravado.<br /><br />What will Camille discover about her past and about the horrific child-murderer lurking somewhere within the town?  Who has killed two little girls, and what do some of the strange behaviors during the murders reveal about the perpetrator?<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000JMKTLO Sharp Objects: A Novel]] was narrated in the first person voice of Camille, and it didn't take long for me to be riveted by her story.  I also learned a lot about the family history, like the dead sister Marian and the strange younger sister Amma.<br /><br />Saying too much could spoil the story, so suffice it to say that you might be stunned by how this story unfolds.  I thought I had it all figured out quite early, but there were twists I wasn't expecting.<br /><br />I liked this passage that describes Camille's mother:<br /><br />\\"Glowing pale skin, with long blonde hair and pale blue eyes.  She was like a girl's best doll, the kind you don't play with.\\"<br /><br />An excerpt that chills me even as it reveals so much.  Another five star read from this author.

B000G6R7B8|5.0|This watch has been around for around 40 years in pretty much it's current configuration.<br /><br />I have a number of watches including a Rolex Oyster Perpetual automatic and a high end Seiko Quartz Chronograph. They're all nice watches but nothing I can keep on my wrist 24/7. They're either too heavy or the band irritates after a long time.<br /><br />Along comes the Seiko 5 automatic. A small but not too small watch that will never require a battery or light. It's light enough that most of the time I forget it's there.<br /><br />The band that came with the watch was nice but it was a two piece. Even though I like that in women's bathing suits, it's not a safe way of attaching my watch to my arm. If a pin breaks you lose or at least drop your watch. I've changed the band to a one piece strap band that threads through the watch pins so if a pin brakes, the band stays on your arm and the watch stays attached with the remaining pin.<br /><br />The light creme color dial and black numbers make it very easy to see in low light. I also like that it has the day and date.<br /><br />It's a watch that I wear all the time. I take it off during showers since I don't want to get soap on it or the band not because it can't get wet. I do go in the pool with it all the time with no ill effects.<br /><br />The Seiko 5 automatic is like a VW Beetle driven by the Energizer Bunny. It just keep on going and going and going.

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|This latest Reacher novel is somewhat different from most of the earlier novels. It does not start out with a confrontation, cracked heads, or any real violence, and the suspense is much slower to develop than Reacher fans have come to expect. As a result, and as you may have noticed from the many reviews here indicating disappointment, many Reacher fans feel that Lee Child has let them down. The story is different from his previous books, and for Reacher fans looking for the expected level of immediate and usually violent retribution from Reacher as he rights whatever wrongs he encounters, it does not deliver in the way that previous novels have.<br /><br />I too have enjoyed the previous Reacher novels more than I enjoyed this one. Like most of the other reviewers, I prefer more action and suspense with my Reacher. But I'm also not ready to give up on Lee Child quite yet, because I also enjoy following Reacher's thought process as he evaluates whatever situation he finds himself in, and I did enjoy reading A Wanted Man. It is true that it has less of the \\"I can't put it down\\" aspect of most of the other Reacher novels. So if you are looking for that, then this may not be the Reacher novel for you (or at least you might want to wait until it comes out in paperback, and save some money).<br /><br />A Wanted Man is Reacher #17. It picks up immediately where #16 (Worth Dying For) ended - Reacher is standing on the side of the road in Nebraska, with a broken nose, hitchhiking. His goal is to eventually find his way to Virginia. He gets picked up and joins three others (two men and a woman) in a car headed towards Chicago.<br /><br />The first quarter of the book alternates between Reacher, traveling cross-country in the car, and the police and FBI who are at the beginning of investigating a man left murdered in a small town. Reacher methodically analyzes the small clues of behavior he picks up from his traveling companions. The FBI duty officer assigned - Julia Sorenson - goes through a very similar process in working to determine who exactly the murder victim was, and what to do next. Terrorism possibilities are implied, the CIA is interested, but nobody will say exactly why.<br /><br />The FBI agent finally joins Reacher, and after some difficulties in the beginning she finally comes to view Reacher as an ally and agrees to accept his assistance.<br /><br />This first half or more of the book is almost totally absent of any action or violence, and maybe you need to be a Reacher fan to enjoy it. I don't know how it would be viewed to someone who is new to Reacher, but for me I enjoy following the internal dialogue of his thought process and the deliberate way in which the plot unfolds.<br /><br />More importantly to the reader there is significantly less tension and suspense than in most other Reacher novels. The kidnapped woman, for example - this is a key motivator for the first half or more of the novel and yet for some reason it doesn't result in much of a sense of urgency for either Reacher or the FBI.<br /><br />There are places where Reacher's actions are questionable. Why for example does Reacher get so belligerent with the two men in the car that they dump him at a remote motel somewhere in Iowa and before he can help the woman who they are holding hostage? Why didn't he think to simply ingratiate himself with them until the opportunity came to overpower them? And why, when he makes his first call to 911, at a stop for gas and while he is still with the people in the car, doesn't he tell the operator as much as possible before he has to hang up the phone, rather than wasting time getting them to transfer him to the FBI? These choices seem inconsistent with Reacher's tendency to think things through analytically before taking action, but I suppose that for Lee Child they are a necessary part of the imperfect path that does finally get Reacher to the finish line.<br /><br />Suspense and action do pick up in the latter portions of the book, so if you have stuck with it for that long then you will be more satisfied. The body count does finally get up to a satisfactory (for Reacher) level, but not until very late in the book. The final scenes contain a lot of action, but even then it is less dramatic than most other Reacher novels. And I'm talking about the final 20 or 30 pages maybe, when the action does get to that level.<br /><br />I can see where some fans are dissatisfied with the book as it does have considerably less action than many of the Reacher novels. We'll have to see if Lee Child takes the criticism to heart and adds more action to the next novel, but I would not want him to over-correct either.<br /><br />I give this 3 stars, because for me the Reacher stories are all enjoyable to read and as a long time fan I find it impossible to resist a new Reacher story, but in comparison with others in the series, this one is definitely more cerebral and less breathless.<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />Now, some background into the Reacher character, as it has developed over the span of these 17 novels:<br /><br />The main reason that Lee Child's novels are so compelling is the superb character that he has created - Jack Reacher (otherwise known to his fans as simply \\"Reacher\\"). He is unique.<br /><br />In most ways, Reacher is straightforward to understand. He has been protecting the weak and those in distress since he was a schoolboy and helped his older brother when trouble arose. The family relocated frequently due to his father's service in the military, and he and his brother frequently had to re-establish themselves in a new location and in the small society of military children who were equally tough.<br /><br />He has a clear view of right and wrong, forged during this upbringing and under the direction of a strong mother (who was French) and father, who was a Captain in the Marines. This view of the world was then reinforced during his 13 years of service as an Army MP. He has a strong moral code and complete integrity.<br /><br />He is an imposing presence - physically above average in height and build - and exceptionally strong. He has highly developed skills in hand-to-hand fighting and other forms of combat developed during his MP years. As an MP he was often required to break up brawls between other highly trained soldiers (picture Reacher entering a bar, quickly moving over to two Army Rangers, grabbing them by the scruff of the neck, cracking their heads together and tossing them into a corner). Now, in civilian life, you can almost picture him as a gladiator in the ring, but his ring is the places of everyday life.<br /><br />He is quick to take the law into his own hands if he feels that justice needs to be done. He does not abuse this by going beyond what circumstances require (in his opinion, anyway). In many of the novels he ends up working with regular law enforcement, offering his MP background to earn their trust and demonstrate his value. The results are generally good but the techniques are not always what the civilian police may like.<br /><br />He does not let himself be disadvantaged by waiting for the other guy to strike first - if he knows that a fight is coming, he will hit first and end it quickly if he can.<br /><br />His own personal needs are modest; he travels with only a toothbrush and the clothes on his back, doesn't own anything of any significance, and seldom stays in one place more than a couple of weeks. He is a man with essentially no baggage, both literally and figuratively.<br /><br />He has few friends but those that he does have are loyal to a fault. Several of his colleagues from the MP days have reappeared over the course of the Reacher novels to help him out. He will almost always develop a relationship with a smart, strong and attractive woman in each of the stories, but they seldom last beyond that. Other than his Army MP history he doesn't have a complicated personal life or back-story that detracts from the main story line. A basic outline of his life growing up and while in the military evolves slowly over the course of the stories but, with just a couple of exceptions over the course of the 17 novels, it is not a main element of the tale.<br /><br />He is smart, and clever in deducing and unraveling the schemes that he is presented with, picking up sometimes obscure clues and worrying them until a picture emerges.<br /><br />Reacher is an individual with complete confidence in his own abilities, not looking for trouble - but not avoiding it either. He is the embodiment of \\"with great power, comes great responsibility\\", as applied to an average guy who just happens to be 6'5\\" and strong as an ox (and almost that exact phrase is one that his mother charged him with when, as a young boy, she recognized the strength that he had and the personality that was developing to go with it).<br /><br />I've read all of these novels, at least two times each. For me the Reacher character is what distinguishes them from the many other \\"action thriller\\" type series with strong lead characters. I like the purity of Reacher's personality and his desire to do what is right.<br /><br />And I have to say that, although I am a fan of Tom Cruise's movies and have enjoyed them very much, I just do not see Tom Cruise as providing a satisfactory portrayal of Reacher. I do understand why Cruise wants to play Reacher. But Cruise is about 20 years too old, and physically unsuitable - 5'7\\" compared to Reacher's 6'5\\". Reacher's size is an important part of the force and intimidation he projects. Also I could be wrong but I just do not see him doing justice to Reachers personality and style.<br /><br />Sorry Tom. We Know Jack Reacher. And you're no Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Reacher is not about being flamboyant. He is not interested in taking credit. Reacher simply does his good work, takes care of the situation, and moves on.<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />Finally, for those who may either be new to Jack Reacher, or who may benefit from a guide to the full series, here is a complete list of the Reacher novels as they were written.

B007MJ9LA2|5.0|This new album is awesome in my point of view and is already one of my favorites from Carlos. I am very guitar orientated so it explains why I am so much \\"in love\\" with this new production. Santana is one a the greatest to me and this album proves me right. I prefer his early work to his latest work. However, this instrumental album manages to give the listener satisfaction whether you prefer the new or the old stuff. The tracks are instrumentals but Carlos can make his guitar sing, cry and scream in the likes of Gary Moore. We are talking about the elite players here so unless you are looking for a predictable pop album, this album is for you! It is \\"real music\\" from the heart and soul. \\"Eres La Luz\\" has words and it does sound good. If you want to listen to some music that will take you on a journey, Go buy this album! It is very good! Hasta Luego! J-J

B006PAZMMK|5.0|Great music. Awesome dubstep tunes! Quick and easy download. Good price. Would definitely recommend. Buy it, you won't be disappointed. They want me to type in at least 20 words. I think I made my point. Just post the review- enough already, dudes!
0345404475|5.0|This novel isn't really about Humans vs Androids, there is a blur between the distinction with both sides sharing the otherside's traits. Deckard himself may even be the most villainous person in the novel.  The book is mainly about societies increasing lack of empathy towards their fellow man.  The androids were built without any empathy, but a lot of humans in the novel appear to lack empathy as well. With the exception of the chicken-head, Isidore, who himself is treated as sub-human, many of the humans seem robotic in their nature.  The humans lack empathy for the androids that were virtually slaves on Mars. They are unable to step in android shoes and empathize with them. You notice that a lot of the humans in the book, Deckard, lack empathy for the animals and chicken-heads.  Although the animals are worshiped and prized for their value, most of them are not loved by their humans in an individual way.  The humans are constantly pulling out their price guide as if they were baseball cards or a valuable piece of furniture.  If you were expecting the cold-blooded, super-human, killing androids from Blade Runner, they are not here.  Most of the androids seem incapable of self-defense and the descriptions of the killing of them is heart breaking, such a waste. A great novel on the dehumanization of society.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Incredible book, spellbinding,thrilling unique.  You cannot wait to get to the next page.  he was a magnificent writer. I wish there were more books to read and enjoy.,
B005DF2QMC|3.0|It is not the most durable unit but all I wanted to do was convert a bunch of my old cassette tapes to Mp3 format.  The auto reverse made that a lot easier.  I was able to do the 40 some odd tapes I had so don't know if I will ever have use for it again.  For the cost of the unit it served well for what I needed.

B007TML4EI|5.0|I thought this was a fun and challenging game. Much like the authors previous game. Those that say phony reviews that have same paragraph structure and punctuation must not know anything about typing on a phone.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I would best describe this and the preceding book as Twilight with BDSM-lite. I enjoy Twilight for the same reason I enjoy this: it is cotton candy for the mind. :)
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is an incredible story told  by a true hero. And let me add, anyone who has served in the modern combat zone is a hero in my book. I'm fascinated by the one star reviews. Certainly everyone is entitled to their opinion, but someone said I should be ashamed for reading this account. Reasons are either political, operational secrecy, literary, I suspect jealousy, and so on. As far as the SEAL pledge for secrecy, I understand, but this is to important a story to be retold In a Hollywood movie, or written about by a war correspondent based on accounts. I want to know what happened by someone who was there. I guess the author could have glossed it up with literary fairy dust but the guys a SEAL, not Hemingway. Someone wrote a critique almost as long as this book! Wow, smoke a peace pipe, that type of opinion was driven by something deeper and premeditated than this account deserved.<br /><br />First, I don't think any national secrets were exposed that have not already been leaked by the administration or written about in cleared books or the bad guys are not aware of already. If someone takes that as a political slam, that is just a fact. Suck it up. If this was an operation like \\"thousands of others\\" than the bad guys know what's coming down when they hear the beating blades. Let's face it, while these guys are dangerous, it's not like crashing a British SIS pajama party. I'm not minimizing the danger of the operation, but the sophistication of the training, techniques and equipment far overshadow the enemy. The beauty of this story is the planning, the months of training, the split second timing, the details, and how it can all go FUBAR! The SEALS and there counterparts, D Force, and other operators are incredible men and have to be admired not only for their selfless dedication and bravery, but by their ability to wing it when it hits the fan, as it inevitably does. Another critique dinged the authors ego. Son, if you don't have rational self confidence every minute in this business, you or someone else will die. I did not think the story was told in an aggrandizing manner at all. I suggest the critique writer has his own confidence issues. Another critique was the poor literary value of the book. Again, it's a story about an immensely important event, written by a SEAL. I guess he could have stuck to the raid itself and been maybe thirty pages long, but we got a lot of background about the author and the SEALs. I did not mind it and enjoyed the background.<br /><br />Lastly, politics. Everyone in the military works for the President, and if you have read enough military history, the men and women in uniform don't always like the CIC. I think this account was written honestly, but the author did have a chip on his shoulder. I believe he felt that this operation was a shared success from years and years of hard work by hundreds of analysts, agents, soldiers, sailors and marines, and that while in 40 some minutes his team and the others faced crippling death, the success of all these men and women is being cheapened for political gain. This was an American success. Period. Ooh Rah!
030758836X|4.0|I honestly loved this book until the end. I absolutely hated the way they ended the book. It started off as a really good read though. I don't regret reading it.

0525953728|4.0|When I heard this book was coming out I was disappointed, thinking this guy was trying to make a buck. However, I heard that the author really wanted people to know what happened in the operation to get Bin Laden and that it differed from what the media lead people to beleive. Additionally, those I know in the military, particularly those in elite forces, frown on that sort of thing; writing a book about your deployment/missions for profit is considered dishonorable and tacky so I was interested to hear this guy's story.  Also, at the end of the book he writes that some of the proceeds from the book will be going to families of fallen Navy SEALs.<br /><br />The book is about how this SEAL became part of Team 6 and his account of what happened in the mission to obtain Osama Bin Laden. It is easy to read and follow, he does use military jargon in parts but explains what most of them mean. I did get annoyed with his mention of some things military related - at the begining of the book he says he hasn't shared anyhting that puts anyone in danger, and I know that people can find some of these things out pretty easily, none of it is top secret, but still with friends and family in the military this really bothered me. I think that any information no matter how small it seems puts soldiers at risk, however since that is my personal pet peeve I didn't use it in my overall rating of the book. Overall it was interesting and I think it gives people an idea of how the media and Hollywood make things appear different than they really are.

B008Y1RTUG|1.0|Maybe its just her acting but Kristen Stewart looked constipated the entire movie with a some relief in the final minutes of the film.  Also Theron who is super hot was made fugly by CGI and lowered the entertainment value of the film for me.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|We know this presentation has hundreds of reviews. Many of the reviewers have seen different versions and have their favorites. I to have seen different versions and have the Sarah Brightman CDs. If this is not your favorite it is a great reminder. So there's not much new that I can contribute other than saying this was exceptionally well done and I will be watching it again and again.<br /><br />This Andrew Lloyd Webber musical drama with the feel of an opera inside an opera is about a disfigured genius who is hidden from view but coercing an opera house in Paris to play his opera that he wrote to display the girl that he fell in love with.<br /><br />I won't go through all the details as that it's why you're looking at this production. I will just say that if you seen it before you haven't really seen it before and if this is your first time you will fall in love with Weber's music.<br /><br />Not reading the reviews first I was surprised to find that the program features original cast appearances and several of the play's most acclaimed Phantoms. Sarah Brightman even sings for us.<br /><br />As with many classics there will be a new generation of players to carry the presentation forward.<br /><br />You will find yourself \\"floating falling\\" with \\"sweet intoxication\\".

B000I55YU8|5.0|Black Rain may look like just another high testosterone thriller but look again and you will find that we are being given something much deeper than that.  Thanks to a great script and great direction plus wonderful acting by Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia and Takakura Ken as well as deeply moving music by Hans Zimmer this film reaches us in the heart.  It creates a world we can live in.  A wonderful film.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a book that I could not put down.  Nice to hear the real inside story.  The current administration deems it a threat to national security, but I see it as a threat to re-election.  Anyway kudos to the best fighting force on the planet.  Thank you for all you do!
B006TZBGBW|5.0|Judas Priest, what is there to say that hasn't been said? In actuality, not much. Judas Priest are one of the forerunners of the heavy metal genre and are arguably the progenitors of the entire genre. In this box set you get all of the studio albums from Rocka Rolla to Nostradamus and you also get three live albums in Unleashed in the East, Priest....Live!, and A Touch of Evil: Live, all for about $120 or so. I bought mine from Popmarket and paid $114.99 on a special that they were running at the time. If you have the cash this is definitely the best way to pick up all of the Halford-fronted Priest albums as you are getting them for an average of a little over $7 per albums, an awesome deal! Another thing to note is that it includes a nice little booklet with some pictures and liner notes as well as a cool box to house all of the CDs. It also features new remasters of Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny. All of the other remasters are basically the same as the one's that were released 15 or so years ago, except they are now in mini LP paper sleeves. All in all, for the price, and for the music, you can't go wrong here.
B002ZG999U|1.0|I do not get why Stallone is the lead for one thing, he is probably the worst actor of the group, but then it is a bad movie so placing him as the lead was a good choice I guess.<br /><br />Do not waste your time.

B000GLKLCK|5.0|To listen to the complete Mozart Piano Concertos recorded and played in impeccable taste is indeed a rare treat. It is here that Murray Perahia's touch in all these Concertos is simply magical.<br />Repeat playing of all the discs gives unlimited joy. This is a big call indeed, but the pianist's touch quietly changes from firmness and power, to a very gentle touch in the slow movements. Such a  delicacy is best described as \\"feathery\\". And it is wonderful! It is soft, so soft and expressive that I am sure Mozart , on hearing this, has a big smile.

Not only was the trip back in time fun but the characters were unforgettable. And, will somebody please tell me how Stephen King can continue to make such a novel so incredibly suspenseful even when you obviously know the ending!<br />This was such a pleasure to read.

B000E9910W|3.0|If you like the DB, you're doing yourself an injustice by purchasing a compilation, even a 2 disc compilation. Since I grew up with this band, its hard to realize that a lot of people haven't listened to most of their individual albums.  Even some of the fans going back to the seventies only own the original Best of the DBs, which sold over 10 million copies.  At the very least you should own a copy of The Captain & Me (a double platinum album), which is considered by many to be their masterpiece.  This compilation only draws three songs from The Captain & Me, which is a travesty.  Even though they had a ton of hits, the DB were not a singles band, they were an album band.<br /><br />Remastered copies of their original albums were recently released at a very affordable price (I've been waiting for over 20 years for these re-masters).  These remastered albums are double CDs with two albums in each package with nice informative booklets & some bonus tracks on each CD.  You can actually get The Captain & Me and Vices together; I bought them all (8 albums) for less than $50 total including shipping. Five of those eight albums are platinum or multi-platinum sellers and two were gold albums.  These albums have numerous tracks that are as good or better than the hits, so if you're just listening to the hits, you're really missing out on some of the best music that has ever been produced and you don't even know it.  If you like the DB well enough to buy this compilation, think about digging deeper you won't be disappointed.

I really liked it alot. It was very gripping; kept me reading and not once did I stop. It only took me around an hour once I figured out how to read it. I reccomend this to all Batman and/or Joker fans.
0525953728|5.0|I don't understand the uproar about the Author writing this book if he did not tell the story another member of ST6 would have written their story. Members of ST6 should be happy that this book is written because it tells the TRUE story not the one that the White House fabricated for the American public. I am a Disabled Veteran but not a Tier One Unit Veteran this story tells of the bravery of this Unit , their fortitude , the hardships of multiple deployment BUT they get NO recognition. Our Military has been strained by 11 years of War an the Tier One Units have had to endure multiple deployments , loss of life , career ending injuries. My opinion is that these Operators should be paid in the 6 figure range , the amount of training these Warriors is very costly , they preform missions that no other Unit can accomplish , the risk of carrying out the missions. SO PAY THESE OPERATORS what they are worth don't take them for granted. I have read Chris Kyles Book , Marcus Latrells book , Brandon Webb's book an was amazed by the feats these guys accomplished the sacrifices they paid. I'm OD Green US Army an thought CAG was cutting edge but after reading the stories of Owens , Webb , Kyle , Lutrell it gave me a different outlook on the Seal Team Community.<br />What Mark Owen did was make the USA aware of what these Warriors go through , no operational secrets were revealed , the White House blew the cover naming the Unit , their home base , let some Coke head Hollywood producer get a classified briefing on the raid like shes going to keep her mouth closed during some Hollywood party. The Pentagon even offered her assess to a ST6 member ?<br />The Pentagon approved Zero Dark 30 , Act of Valor that showed how these operators infil & exfil  , operational tactics , the weaponry used but they want to crucify Mr. Owens this looks like a double Standard to me !<br />I applaud Mr. Owens for writing this book and if the Seals Foundation does not want donations send them to the SAS Regimental Association they are in dire need of funds for their fallen , injured , maimed Warriors.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|Book One was definitely the worst. Book Two was pretty good and at least had some substance.  Book Three is fair.  The most interesting part of this last book was in the end when Christian is first person.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I liked this book a great deal. I'll include some mild SPOILERS below - nothing specific, but just to give some detail on the story I'll tell you what it's about.<br /><br />This book deals with terminal illness, first love, child/parent relationships and disappointment.  It was an engrossing book that I read quickly.  I was not 100% satisfied with the ending, but it was pretty close.  I thought I had figured out where it was going a few times and, while I was correct about some elements, I was wrong about others.  Overall, for popular fiction it was much better than average.<br /><br />The book raised some interesting issues and the author developed some really good characters.  I was thoroughly into it while reading and kept thinking about them when I was done.  There were a few little moments that raised an eyebrow for me, but overall - it all hung together well.  As an aside, reading the FAQs on the authors website was somewhat disappointing - I did so after finishing the book and kinda wished I hadn't.<br /><br />All in all - this is not exactly a new classic, but it is a really good read.  I'm giving it 5 stars in the category of popular fiction.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|REC (2007) is a horror thriller with an unusual perspective, as the premise is that the entire movie consists of video shot by the camera of a television crew, as they follow the activities of a fire department unit.  While on a run, things suddenly get really weird, as a group of people find themselves trapped in a building where an outbreak has occurred.<br /><br />Written and directed by Paco Plaza and Jaume Balaguero, this production with Spanish as the spoken language, is completely effective and terrifying, even when following along reading subtitles.  Creatively staged and shot, the movie has a live \\"realtime\\" feel that captures the immediacy of the situations, and the pulse pounding excitement and fear when threats are encountered.  Subtracting the end credits, the movie has a briskly flowing runtime of about 73 minutes.<br /><br />TV host Angela Vidal (Manuela Velasco) and her camera operator Pablo (Pablo Rosso) are at a fire station shooting a piece about firemen, when a call comes in and they join the unit as they go out on a call.  They enter a three storey apartment building, and together with two policemen, break into a unit where an old woman is apparently ill.  Behaving strangely, the woman bites one of the cops in the neck.  The group retreats downstairs, but when they attempt to leave the building, they find that it has been locked down, and the authorities are preventing anyone from leaving.<br /><br />After one of the firemen is injured, the old woman is shot dead by Officer Joven (Jorge-Yamam Serrano), when she attacks.  Those trapped inside do attempt to get out, but find soldiers blocking their way.  With communications mysteriously knocked out, Angela is determined to record what is happening, particularly when a health inspector from disease control, enters the building to examine the wounded.  The inspector reveals that the building has been identified as the source of a disease.  When the injured become violent and escape, it triggers a chain reaction of panic and terror, that builds like a wave which finally comes crashing down at the film's sudden and shocking finish, that might leave you quivering with shock.<br /><br />REC starts quite innocuously with a spirit of fun, and then suddenly plunges into a dark world full of uncertainly and immense danger.  The building becomes like a prison, where the survivors trapped inside first become victims of the disease, and once infected, join the raging hoard thirsting for blood.  As the intensity of the violence progresses, the setting becomes darker as electrical power is cut off, until the light mounted to the camera, becomes the sole source of illumination.  When that is gone, the camera's infrared viewer provides the film's final images.<br /><br />The ferociousness, speed, and the propensity of the infected to suddenly pop out of the dark and tear you to shreds, makes the infected pretty frightening.  The victims have few weapons, and have little choice but to run for their lives.  It's not really believable that Pablo the cameraman would continue to shoot, when people are being attacked, or when he is running of his life, but when you are caught up in the mayhem of what seems to be real event, it rather easy to forget about those aspects of \\"reality\\".<br /><br />While everything is seen through Pablo's camera, Angela remains in view much of the time, attempting to report what is happening, as things are going to hell.  Manuela Velasco is fantastic, giving an edgy performance that is completely convincing and believable, as her emotions and reactions are a barometer for what is happening.  The supporting cast are all also very good, including a little girl who suddenly who turns into a monster.  The writing generally keeps things very tight, with little extraneous dialog or hysterics, making REC an impactful and scary film that moves briskly, that generally remains very focused.<br /><br />Creative, edgy, and to the point, REC was very well received critically, and garnered several awards in the horror community.  It is hinted at, but not explicitly stated what the infected are suffering from, however this matter is explored further in the sequel [[ASIN:B003Q6D246 REC 2]] (2009), which was then followed by [[ASIN:B008S9D1V0 REC 3 Genesis]] (2012).  The series is set to conclude with REC 4 Apocalypse, which is currently in development.

B008COD5OO|1.0|This was possibly the worst movie ever.  It actually frightens me that people could be stupid enough to think up something like this. For instance Not one action that occured in this movie would be allowed to happen in real life. The plot is almost non-existant, other than the continual quest to \\"finger bang\\" a chick, and to throw a large party to become popular, there really is no plot. Quite possibly the worst part was the ending, which there is a lack of satisfaction due to the fact that the kid burned down half of his block and his parents just let him get away with it..... In short, I would rather clean the toilet than be forced to watch this movie again.

0439023513|3.0|I saw a movie and really really wanted to read the books and see what happens next, so I bought them all and read them within a couple of days. I was sooo captivated with these books, but when I finished - I feel so sad and empty and disappointed. *Spoiler* It was annoying to read and see her (in my mind)weak and throwing up and sick the whole book. I'll be honest, the resolution of the love triangle was the driving force to finishing these books quickly. I was rooting for Gale the whole book, but into the third one, I really started seeing the Author making a turn to show that he won't be the right one for Katniss. I was so upset for him, as if he never even gotten a chance, just felt so painful to completely exclude him and distance him and not even give any hope that he'll be happy one day even at the end of the book. I didn't mind all the crazy action going on in the MockingJay, but I agree with other reviewers that killing off all the heroic and critical characters seems forced and unnatural :( It was meant to be a happy ending, but I have so many questions left unanswered and feel so sorry for a lot of them, that it just left me sand and disappointed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is great. I just wish the font was a little larger. I am glad I can finally get the app on my Kindle Fire.
B00622BF40|4.0|I watched this film for a graduate level class on dysfunctional/oppressive relationships. The character development is excellent as are the role structures of the characters. The film has a good plot, denouement and finish. I would recommend this film for those interested in a good story about rising from oppression from the judgement of others (including family and community). Kinda has a \\"B\\" feel to it, but it is a good movie!
B008BO61BE|5.0|Screaming For Vengeance is worthy of a 30th Anniversary, even if the CD portion is just a reissue of the 2001 remaster with 3 extra previously unreleased live songs which are Riding On The Wind, You got Another Thing Coming and Screaming For Vengeance.  I thought that Electric Eye was also previously unreleased but I'm pretty sure that it appears on the Metalogy boxset.<br /><br />But the US Festival DVD is the reason to get this set which is just spectacular and is essential for Judas Priest fans to now own in an official release.  I don't know of any other special editions Priest will have planned in the future, but I would bet that they will pass on a 30th Anniversary of Turbo in 2016 in favor of a 25th anniversary release of Painkiller in 2015.
0061743526|5.0|This beautiful story is ultimately about looking beneath the surface, past skin color and differences in socioeconomic status or station to what defines goodness and what defines evil. Casting aside the shallow boundaries dictated by time and place, Atticus Finch unknowingly passes onto his children a thirst for the truth. Atticus, so needlessly worried about not being enough of a parent since their mother died and providing what Jem and Scout need most, instills in them a boundless curiosity for life and all its inhabitants.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of Scout an extremely astute and precocious child of 6, her daily adventures along with her brother and their close friend, Dill are interwoven into the story of a pivotal court case. Atticus is assigned to defend a black man falsely accused of beating and raping a white woman. The responsibility of upholding the law and offering this man a fair trial along with substantial evidence to indict becomes a monumental challenge as the citizens of a Southern Alabama town in the 1930's are emotionally forced to put aside their masks and reveal their true selves. Just about every human archetype is represented and all are disseminated by Scout who learns the most valued of life's lessons and comes to realize just how remarkable a man her father truly is. What Scout has not yet fully realized is that she is every bit as remarkable and is truly Atticus's daughter.<br /><br />The Mockingbird reference is poetically tied to one of the story's main characters however could easily be applicable to several of them. Scout as well as Jem and Dill exist as strong voices of reason unaffected by social mores and society's expectations. We see this especially in Scout who with childlike innocence and an intelligence that belies her years elicits a call so strong that whether rising to the occasion or falling deeper into a hole, not one can fail to react.<br /><br />Simply told, this is the story that defined winning a case by a belief and the willingness to stand up for what is right, no matter the cost. To Kill A Mockingbird is an unrivaled literary masterpiece.belief and the willingness to stand up for what is right, no matter the cost. To Kill A Mockingbird is an unrivaled literary masterpiece.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|I bought this box based on the reputation of Otterbox and the good reviews.  The case is good, everything lines up with the phone (i.e., the buttons, covers on the silicone case/hard cover and the phone). Takes a bit of man handling to get into the hard case so don't expect to be switching out batteries quickly.  I knew from before that the corner/ends were not covered by the hard case and I find this odd as when you drop a phone it has a good probability of the corners taking the impact. The case also comes with a screen protector which is not the easiest to put on. It took numerous tries for me to apply it to reduce the number of bubbles.  The card to press out the bubbles is small and the cloth to clean the glass is also small. I ended up having to use the card and cloth from a zagg screen protector.  Once the protector is on, it is very clear but it collects/shows a lot of finger print oils.  Other than that, the case adds a nice thickness to the phone just wish the hard case was textured as it is very slick and if you are not careful the phone can slip.

B003P9VZ0W|4.0|The stickers looked great on my daughters room the only drawback is that they're not the biggest princess stickers but they do fine if you have other pictures up otherwise they look small. They stuck really well to the wall and could reposition them whenever I needed to move them to put up other decorations on the wall. All in all I would recommend these for a smaller room versus a larger room.
0061743526|5.0|I think this may be the best book of the 20th century, at least written in the English language.  I know many will disagree, but how can you not put it in the top 10?  My good friend Perry, who passed away last year, used to tell me to read Mockingbird every 10 years or so.  As we age there is something new between those same old pages.  He was right.  Read it as a child in school, again in your twenties, then your thirties, and on.  Lee tells an adult story through the eyes of a child and with every passing decade the story deepens.

B007UPNA6Y|1.0|I was appalled at the price of the Kindle version of A Wanted Man. I enjoyed the early Reacher books but found them becoming repetitive and predictable. After seeing the price set for this book and reading the comments it didn't seem like a good buy. The economies of electronic publishing should be passed on to consumers. It appears that greed is rampant everywhere these days.
B002VWNID6|5.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\" starring Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Neat movie. I enjoyed it very much. Well, who doesn't know the story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men living in Sherwood Forest and robbing the rich and giving the proceeds to the poor. It's a classic. I guess I first read it in grade school and who knows how many different versions I've seen on TV and in the movies. That's okay, for a movie like this I just sit back, relax and enjoy. Most of the actors, except for the bad guys, look like they're having a really good time. The movie is even funny in places, but it never drifts into being a comedy. The horses are magnificent. The low-tech battle scenes are spectacularly done using high-tech techniques. The settings are superb. There's lots of action. death and destruction.The costumes of the robbers are so grubby that they look like they would smell bad if you got close enough to them. And, the leading lady remarked to Robin Hood that he might bathe more often. It was a funny remark that fit.<br /><br />The movie was very well done. Surely it got a bunch of awards. The DVD really surprised me in splitting the movie into two halves, one on each side. And my transition through this unusual operation was rather awkward. No big deal, though. It's a good movie and Kevin Costner makes a very likable robber.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

0312641893|4.0|Linh Cinder (surnames are said first) lives in New Beijing, is sixteen-years-old fantastic mechanic and also happens to be a cyborg.  The ward of her stepmother that focuses only on her natural daughters Peony and Pearl, Cinder is forced to work to support the family. Her trade is so well known that even Prince Kai seeks her out for a royal android repair. The world is under attack by a mysterious plague that spreads in an unknown way and kills on a strict timeframe. There is no cure and cyborgs are used for test research.<br /><br />Cinder's stepmother Andri can't resist sending her away to the royal palace as a test subject when her youngest stepsister falls ill with the plague. Devastated over losing Peony, Cinder complies, desperate to do anything to save her life. Yet as the tests commence secrets and revelations come to light. Cinder's crush on Kai seems light-years away as her past is uncovered and she fights for her right to exist in an anti-cyborg world.<br /><br />I must give a shout out to Marissa Meyer who is from Tacoma, Washington State, my mom's hometown. I was delighted after I finished the book to discover a Washington State writer wrote it. I think Meyer did a wonderful job at tackling the huge task of retelling the Cinderella fairytale. The basic story is still there which does make it a bit predictable but with a dystopian setting it's a fun and refreshing read. As history repeats itself with this deathly plague, Meyer uses creative settings and impressive steam punk imagery to recast a modern Cinderella.<br /><br />I loved the book; it had me on the edge of seat. Even when I knew a mile away certain things were going to happen, I think Meyer strategically worked the fairytale to her advantage. I'd be upset if she didn't stick with the core story and she mixed other fairytale elements that succeed in a post apocalyptic world. I'd recommend Cinder in a heartbeat to anyone that wants a different, stronger Cinderella but isn't ready to leave the dystopian genre.

B0097EICIC|2.0|The main character Oskar Schell is the most unlikeable spoiled kid in the entire world.<br /> He's vicious to his mother, and carries an insidious tambourine that ruins every poignant moment.<br /><br />A disrespectful compression of Foer's well written book [[ASIN:0547735022 Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (Movie Tie-In): A Novel]] but an even worse rendition than most movies that can't properly render any book.<br /><br />The wounded characters in the film are vastly underdeveloped and the film becomes just a casting job for Tom Hanks cadre of friends who are normally brilliant performers but aren't given the proper respect of camera time.<br /><br />Sadly, it just becomes a continuously disappointing compilation like Synedoche but with even more annoying characters.<br /><br />This film would be absolutely despised if it didn't revolve around the tragedy of 9/11 which combined with the top notch, but ill used cast, is what lures the majority of viewers into the conclusion of contempt for Oskar Schell.<br /><br />After watching this film, I've stopped keeping mysterious keys AND immediately leave the room anytime I hear tambourines.  I never thought it was possible to hate tambourines until being repeatedly assaulted with the jingling of this film.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I purchased the seat for my fast approaching 2 year old son. After looking around I decided that having him in front of me was going to be best for the situations I generally wanted to take him out riding. Mostly bike paths and local roads - I liked the fact we would be able to talk without having to turn around etc.<br /><br />It was a bit of a pain to put together the first time, but once I understood what bits went where, it's pretty obvious really. I have a hybrid bike and a fairly large frame (i'm 6'2) so this sits comfortably just over the cross rail which gave me confidence that if anything slipped it would drop onto the bar, but so far after several days worth of riding, both around Boston and Cape Cod, it's been rock solid. I leave the bar attached all the time now as i'm not bothered by the extra weight, and it's now really easy to put the seat back on and off, with one single thumb screw.<br />I didn't have any trouble at all with the included wrench and hex key, so I don't know if more recent purchases have been improved in this regard or not.<br /><br />My fairly tall two year old fits perfectly, is very happy to be there and can rest his head on the padded front part if he gets tired. One thing to bear in mind as others have pointed out is that the little one can and usually does hold onto the handle bars, gears etc when seated so watch out for this. Personally I love the interaction of having him right there in front of my chest and practically holding hands the whole time. The straps are also a bit of a mess, but once you've played around with them for a little bit you can get them in a fairly safe position. Sure they aren't going to hold the kid as well as your 5 point Britax car seat straps, but they keep them in place well enough they aren't going to slip out from in front of you.<br />I can see that for shorter frames it might be a bit of an issue having this in front of you as you do have to move your legs a little differently than normal, and ashorter frame is just going to exacerbate that.<br /><br />To say he absolutely loves it is an understatement, the day after his first ride on it, he ran over to me as soon as I got home from work with his mickey mouse helmet in hand, shouting bike, bike - that alone justified the money I spent on this!

0465068367|4.0|NANKING is a thoroughly documented and well written account of Japan's unparalleled World War II atrocities centered in northern China. What magnifies Japan's criminal barbarism is the way it has gone unnoticed and unpunished for so long because of denial and repression and political influence. The Nazis have been held accountable and their atrocities well-documented and publicized, even in films such as SCHINDLER'S LIST, but the bloodlust of the Nanking Massacre isn't even mentioned in the vast majority of American history books.<br />One has to ask the question: Why don't Americans know more about Japan's wartime atrocities such as Nanking, Manchuria and the Bataan Death March?<br />My strongest feelings about the book are contained in a couple of quotes: \\"Another reason to be gleaned from Nanking is the role of power in genocide. Those who have studied the patterns of large-scale killings throughout history have noted that the sheer concentration of power in government is lethal--that only a sense of absolute unchecked power can make atrocities like the Rape of Nanking possible.\\"<br />\\"And there is a third lesson to be learned, one that is perhaps the most distressing of all. It lies in the frightening ease with which the mind can accept genocide, turning us all into passive spectators to the unthinkable. The Rape of Nanking was front-page news across the world, and yet most of the world stood by and did nothing while an entire city was butchered.\\"<br />Those who are ignorant of history may be doomed to repeat it. This book makes the reader aware of the barbarism Japan's Shinto based government was capable of. Until there's official Japanese acknowledgment, apology, punishment and payment of restitution, we can only assume Japan endorses what was done. And if that's the case, how can we trust such a country?<br />After more than a decade of researching and writing about unspeakable acts of cruelty, Iris Chang took her life in 2004. She was researching the Bataan March when she died. She was alone in a car on a rural road. I wish I'd known her and been her friend, someone she could have called. I would have told her to take some time off work to relax and have fun and take care of herself.<br />When our passion for justice becomes too entwined with our sense of self, we lose sight of the fundamental requirements for health and happiness. We forget that a healthy and happy mind will extend the depth and breadth of our contribution to whatever cause we have chosen.<br />But that can be easier said than done when we shoulder the load of other people's pain and sorrow. From her writing it was clear that Iris was aware that the people whose justice she pursued were dying and there wasn't much time.<br />May all who pursue such causes take a lesson from Iris Chang and devote some time to nourish our selves.<br />But what if it weren't a suicide? Chang had powerful enemies in a social hierarchy that has been known for ruthlessness. She was dedicated to exposing their horrific misdeeds and had received death threats. It would be simple for a ninja master to slip Iris an hallucinogenic drug to give her the appearance of a mental breakdown and then coerce her into writing suicide notes. Is everyone who writes about Japanese war atrocities at risk of such a fate, even today? When will it end?<br />These are the thoughts people will have until Japan comes clean.March when she died.

B005LAJ23A|4.0|Rick Grimes and his fellow survivors have escaped from Atlanta. Making for Fort Benning and the hope of rescue, the group is waylaid on the highway by a horde of walkers. With one of the group missing and another severely injured, they find a safe haven at a nearby farm and the hope of a new home. But as the days and weeks pass, the unresolved tensions in the group threaten to tear it apart.<br /><br />The second season of The Walking Dead picks up shortly after the events of the first. Whilst the first only had six episodes to tell its story, the second has thirteen, giving it more time to explore the premise and characters.<br /><br />Things get off to a strong start in the first few episodes, which focus on the confrontation on the highway and the attempts to bring the group back together. New characters - the Greene family - and a new location - a large farmstead - are introduced and events unfold with some vigour. However, after the third episode the story bogs down a little as characters start spinning their wheels at the farm. This is where the ramifications of a major pre-season production crisis - a budget cut that infuriated showrunner Frank Darabont and saw him leave the series - are at their most noticeable. Whilst the budget problems ground the series for a little too long at the farm, the producers do make the most of the money they do have. The zombie effects are a cut above the more variable effects of the first season and there are some truly gruesome moments that equal the most visceral scenes of any zombie movie that comes to mind.<br /><br />The long pause at the farm does allow some effective character development, particularly of Shane (Jon Bernthal), whose growing disillusionment with the group and his inability to accept the new status quo and move on is depicted quite well, even if the story does take a few too many episodes to come to a head. However, probably the best characterisation is left to Daryl (Norman Reedus), who evolves from thequieter brother of racist redneck Merle in the first season into a conflicted, complex character who refuses to fit easily into any stereotype. Rick (Andrew Lincoln), our main protagonist, gets a little lost in the mix this season with storylines focusing mostly on other characters, but comes back strong towards the end of the season as he starts to show signs of not handling the stress of command very well. However, his dynamic with Herschel (Scott Wilson) and the twists and turns it goes through is fascinating, with Herschel moving from a pacifistic man of faith to shotgun-wielding zombie-slayer under Rick's (not entirely laudable) influence. The introduction of Maggie (Lauren Cohan) as a love interest for Glenn (Steven Yeun) also adds a rare glimmer of sunlight to a dark season.<br /><br />Whilst the season does suffer from some slow pacing in its central section, it remains highly watchable, and the pacing issue is mitigated considerably on DVD without a week-long break between each episode. There are some effective moments of dark humour (the 'zombie well' scene is hilarious), the writing is pretty good and the actors mostly effective. Aside from the pacing issue, the character of Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) suffers the worst from inconsistent writing and motivations, which the actress does her best to make sense of but can't quite sell.<br /><br />Events culminate in a fairly epic two-part season finale in which the bubbling tensions within the group boil over and the biggest battle between the survivors and the zombies to date takes place. Despite some longeurs and niggling problems, Season 2 (****½) ends on a high that leaves a lot of balls in the air for the third season and its promise of introducing some of the best characters and storylines from the comic book to the TV series. The series is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).

0525953728|2.0|Like many, I had been waiting for this book to find out exactly what really happened during the raid.<br />To be honest, the book told me little more than what was already out there. In fact, the New Yorker article from August 2011 pretty much told the story correctly, just 3 months after the raid (and was better written and certainly more gripping). I was also expecting more detail. Instead, the authors seem to gloss over large chunks of time and pertinent, (but not what would be deemed classified) information. An example is the Maersk Alabama chapter. Several pages dedicated to the HALO jump, but less than one page to the actual contact. Now I know that this book is not about that mission, but if you are going to include it, then do so with at least some effort. The same can be said about the actual contact with Bin Laden. Once again the action is glossed over with very little detail. One minute they are going up the stairs, the next, the author is in the room with a dead, but twitching Bin Laden. Now my understanding was that the author's biggest complaint was that the actual death of Bin Laden was not correctly portrayed by this administration, and that he was going to set the record straight. He does not. And any other discrepancies are so subtle, you really will have to do your research ahead of time to spot them. So for me, this book is average at best and somewhat anticlimactic.<br /><br />On top of that, it is simply not well written. I am not just talking about the numerous typos,or the overly large point-size print, but it is as if it were written for a an elementary school project. Add in the confusing, over-use of the single word SEAL to identify each and every individual in the mission (why not use SEAL 1 ,SEAL 2, etc.?), and you are left with a 316 page book that can be read in just one short afternoon.<br />The only positive is (and I am taking the author at his word here), that the majority of my $16 will be donated to the truly worthy causes outlined in the book. In closing, I do thank the author, his colleagues and all those who serve for their service and bravery in protecting us all. Whatever his reasoning is for publishing this book, he is an American hero; no question about it.

B006Z00M9I|4.0|It seems like the person before me may have written this review for the theatrical release as opposed to this extended version. Anyhow, a lot of people have complained and/or mentioned that a great many scenes released via the trailers were not actually in the movie. Even though I loved this third installment I was a bit disappointed and confused too. HOWEVER... this extended version of the film delivers what the theatrical one did not. I would say there are probably 5-6 added scenes that really do contribute to the story and make the film a little clearer. I was initially a little apprehensive to put money down for the Extended version because typically that doesn't mean much, but I would definitely recommend this to any lover of the films. Even if they already saw it in theatres. This version even included a couple scares and jumps that I personally don't remember from any of the trailers. All that to say... for the full package definitely purchase or rent this one.<br /><br />P.S. Mixed feelings about PA4. Im hoping they actually tie up the story and end it by answering or clarifying some of the big unanswered questions from the previous three films like the strange writing on the basement door and where did Katie take the baby and where is he now? These films have had a good run and if they drag it out too long it will really be a shame. I guess we'll find out!

Since the 10th episode of the first season I have always watched it, and around my house everyone knows I get livid if they skip it on the DVR. There is no doubt that I won't watch this series till the very end. I have already pre-ordered this on eBay for $18.99 Normally I always wait to have others get pricey items for me but with all seasons of Vampire Diaries I've bought them myself. I cannot wait till season 4, especially after what happened on the last episode although I won't say what happens, someone may get angry. If you ever want to talk TVD comment on this post :)

0307949486|4.0|Let me get this out of the way: I enjoyed this book tremendously. When it first came out, I heard all the hoopla but resisted. And since I am not much of a mystery reader (except for old John MacDonald stuff), I wasn't going to go out of my way to read it. Then the movie came out but I didn't see it. Finally, I said to myself, \\"Okay, let's see what this was all about.\\" I'm happy I did.<br /><br />No sense retelling what everyone else has said. This was a way above-average murder mystery. The writing was dense, sometimes too dense. I found that the pacing suffered significantly in places. Some details could have used some trimming. (Hence, my title.) But don't let this deter you from reading the book! The characters are fascinating. Blomkvist and Salander (along with several side characters) are so appealing that you miss them when they aren't present. The mystery at the core of the book will satisfy the shrewdest reader.<br /><br />There is a lot of brutality, even sadism, here. Larsson's outrage at the exploitation of women is palpable and his statistics concerning crimes against women (in Sweden) are disturbing. But this information serves to make the crimes against the women in the book all the more credible--and horrifying.

0060987464|5.0|I started off reading reviews about this book before I bought it and everyone else's view definitely sold me on it. Even the bad reviews had me curious on what it would be like. People saying it was too dirty, raunchy, and taboo had me itching to see what it would be all about.<br /><br />As a big Marilyn Manson fan, the positive reviews sold me as well. I wanted to know how his rise to fame came about. I wanted to know how his childhood effected his song writing, his live performance, all of it, today. One of the biggest things I was most looking forward to was his meeting with the famed Anton LaVey (the founder of the Satanic church) You follow his drug (ab)use, and hear about his struggle with releasing the band's earliest material up until anti-christ superstar.<br /><br />The descriptions were sometimes hard to follow and occasionally you have a hard time figuring out if you're the one not reading it correctly or if Manson isn't thinking correctly, but that's the beauty of the book. I would recommend this to any Manson fan or just about anyone into a morbid read. I read this aloud to my SO during some of the more interesting parts (which was just about all of it) and they were very into it, despite not being a fan of Manson's music at all. I think this is a book anyone (18+ maybe..?) can enjoy.

She acts as though the age difference with and her husband were his fault and that she is entitled to a young, more virile bedmate.  The lover in question is a former flyer in the WW II British airforce, who cannot seem to understand that the war is over and he is not a hero, and her older, weak-willed husband allows the two of them to walk all over him.  The only person of interest comes with a too brief appearance of the husband's \\"dragon lady\\" mother.<br /><br />Spend your money and time elsewhere.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|iloveee PicsArt alot is soo easy to use  and the edit is easy to use and the colors r soo prettty
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I love Sanderson stories.  He always comes up with new, unique universes that have very different cultures and environments.  Besides the Mistborn titles, this is my next favorite of his.<br /><br />As usual, he focuses on a handful of characters, though his principal attention is spent on 3.  Two are very similar to ones that he has put in central positions in his other novels and one is not, but fits a pretty specific fantasy archetype.  If you haven't read a ton of Sanderson titles, you obviously wouldn't notice the similarities, and this isn't criticizing their presence.  As usual, it is well written.  The characters are convincing, well developed.  What I like about Sanderson is that he creates characters that are believable, that you can like and respect.  Even with his villains, he doesn't make them 1-dimensional, but makes them multifaceted, where you can find something to be respected or understood about their motivations/actions.<br /><br />In this book, there actually isn't really a direct villain, which is surprising.  It is all about the threat of some greater evil.  It's sort of like the early books of The Wheel of Time.  There is danger and tension, but little direct \\"bad guy\\" time.  I mean, the way the book opens, you know there is something very powerful and threatening in the universe, but the vast majority of this book is spent on \\"setting the stage\\" and developing characters.  The book does a great job of that- it isn't slow, or uninteresting by any means.  You very much want to know how things will end up for each of the characters that he introduces.<br /><br />Sanderson is one of the few authors I have read that can actually make you laugh when you're reading, and he does it easily, without taking away from the gravity of the stories he tells.  It isn't just the humor, it's ultimately the dialogue he creates, which is believable and natural.  Many authors can't do that- Sanderson makes you really think you're \\"listening in\\" on the conversationof friends, strangers, or enemies.<br /><br />The one negative that I would say, is that while it is titled \\"The Way of Kings\\", that is only a small part of the story in this book.  It is definitely an IMPORTANT one, but it seems slightly underdeveloped to be the title.  I'm sure he has the entire story mapped out, so I don't doubt that it will prove to be important to the greater story, but I felt there should have been more dealing specifically with that.
B007TML4EI|1.0|all the 5 star reviews are phonies. it crashed my device and I had to uninstall it. don't bother. I didn't even get to see the game because it crashed. waste of time and money
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I really loved this book. It wasn't a terribly challenging read, but it was engaging and provided some interesting commentary on socialization, conflict, and the government. I'm excited to read the next book in the series, and would definitely recommend this book to others.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have been following this book and have lost some weight--slowly and some inches.  I will not go back to my old way of eating because I feel young again and I like it. ( I'm 59 & I feel like I did when I was 16. really!!)<br />  I wonder how long it is going to take the farmers in the country to return to growing einkorn wheat because when this catches on it will be a cash plus crop.  The cost of this flour is very high.  And we are sick of being sick so.....<br /> Also, smart restaurants are going to be offering einkorn products in their gluten free menus. Panera better get onboard with this quickly or they can kiss their franchises goodbye.<br /> Americans are getting smarter and this is one of the most important books in this century along with Dr. Mary Newport's book--What If There Was A Cure for Alzheimer's and Nobody Knew About It.  My mom and her sister are getting better every day from their Alzheimer's ( no thanks to the Alzheimer's Association who tried to block this information--shame on you.  Get another job folks- maybe the Heart Association will need you.)  OOps !! that is wrong I forgot about Joel Furmans book - Eat to Live- and his other books.<br /> If I knew how I would seriously nominate Dr. Mary Newport and Dr. William Davis for the Noble Prize.  Does anyone know how to do this?  They deserve it!!<br /> America--read this book and act.  The life you save will be your own!!
B005F8CL1S|5.0|As an American fan of Leonard Cohen I was very pleased to find this set on Amazon. LC is one of the greatest songwriters of our time and deserves much more media attention than he receives. This set is the perfect way for fans to buy all the studio albums up to &#34;Dear Heather.&#34; There are a few drawbacks though. None of Cohen's live albums are included, and listeners receive limited liner notes and lyrics. But it's the music that counts, and for this price customers receive a generous amount of music that comes neatly packaged in a small grey box, making it easy to take this collection along wherever thou goest. A must have for all members of the 'Order of the Unified Heart!'
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Awesome game but starts to freeze attract a while. still worth it though if your a patient person. Other than that, love it!
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I love this album. This album is one I will always remember. Frank Ocean is definitely one of the best singer/songwriter this generation has seen so far. I would go as far to call him the Marvin Gaye of today. His lyrics combined with his voice are to die for. Although I did wish the production had a little more range as nostalgia ultra did, this album is special in its own special way.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Hands down the best series going on TV.  It isn't your typical, predictable zombie movie. It takes the zombie genre to the next level keeping you on your feet and guessing as to what it going to happened next. Give it a try; I am sure that you will like it.  I can't wait for season 3.
B0064W652A|5.0|Haven't read a comic book in over 10 years and I never read a DC comic until this one. I'm glad I did though, I obviously been missing out on Batman specifically. Always been a marvel guy myself until recently. Decided I wanted to try something new, batman has always been a popular character but never really knew a lot about his lore or particulars. Anyway, awesome comic book. Great art and awesome story.  I give it a five out of five.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|The musicians cram a lot of musical sound in a small musical \\"space\\"... the concept being told is an old one, repeated many times in song and verse, but all in all it's pretty nice to see it remembered... the rendition has enormous energy and compression.  So if you in the dumps, the message might split two ways: if you identify with the King (not so good); if you don't give a \\"d%$^\\" about kings and just enjoy the idea (thank God I ain't a King) and music (good).
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Detailed design with a well thought out game play. Extra games based on the main game available and all are creative.
B008FDP7AW|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd does it again. Totally awesome music. If you like rock and or southern rock this is a must buy
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|Dont listen to critics great album a must buy. He lets you inside his soul on this one his vocals are on point songs go in hard and deep!

B007PVHANM|5.0|My husband was very pleased and watches it every chance he gets. We look forward to purchasing more Bob Marley items from you.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|It was really refreshing to find a show on TV like SMASH.  It is superbly scripted and acted.  The music is beautiful and the actors are so very talented.  What a wonderful change from reality TV.
0143039504|5.0|This Book arrived in good  condition, true to the seller's word, and also in good time (well within estimated arrival time). It is a very attractive design, except that the picture on the front is a little risque. I would preper a picture less... provocative. I cannot wait to read it! I am a huge Austen fan! How convenient to have seven books in one! That saves money and bookshelf space! I've already read all of the seven novels it contains, except for Lady Susan. Austen is amazing. If you haven't read her, then purchase this book! Read it! Delight is contained within these pages!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Well paced action that doesn't get lost in bad guy subplots or overblown action. Also, it has one of the best female leads in an action film. Worth a rental. If you're a young woman, worth a buy.
B005MMYC7I|5.0|I was flipping through channels when I came upon an episode of Spartacus. I was hooked from just one episode. Being a huge fan of Game of Thrones, I loved Gods of the Arena and Blood and Sand. I will watch all the other episodes in order and then start it all again.
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|A role of army sergeant - an unemotional and not wordy, fits Wahlberg perfectly. Sticking  with roles like this will see Mark's career soar. Back to the movie - plot is pretty solid for a thriller. Overall movie has a good balance or paranoia, govt conspiracy and butt kicking. I watched it twice and enjoyed. Why only 4 stars? - it is forgettable. In the middle of watching it second time I remembered watching it a couple years before.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I already had a Pintrest account before I got the app on my Kindle Fire but I absolutely love the app. It is so easy to manage and quicker to scroll through than on the computer. I recommend this app!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Overall a nice game. It would be better if it had hints instead of just guided solutions, and it should either go right into the next stage or actually let you choose the stage instead of showing a disabled select screen after finishing a stage. Other than that it's a well made puzzle game.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|I bought this headset for my son, within 2 months he was experiencing the same problems everyone else had been.  We still had the warrenty but Turtle Beach would not exchange the headset.  His issue was popping in and out, people not being able to hear him or he couldn't hear them.  I explained this to Turtle Beach and sent all neccessary documentation required and they began to send pieces for the headset via mail to fix issue and they sent back the same headset we sent them and said there was no issue.  Between emails and phone calls we got no where for 2 more months!!!<br />My son used the headset anyway but I just want to WARN everyone.<br />DO NOT BUY TURTLE BEACH PRODUCTS!!!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I think this book is awesome. It's similar to the hungar games but also very different. The way the author wrote this book from characters eyes is amazing. You are able to see were both characters are with their hearts.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It took a bit to get into the story.  Then I was hooked & it was hard to put down.  The ending really threw me though.  I was very disappointed at how it ended.  I felt like Nick really would become his father.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Now I don't do book reviews but I felt I had to do one on this book because of all the bad reviews. In my opinion (which I am entitled too) this book was good. I see why it was on the NY Times Bestseller List! In this book we are introduced to the main characters Anastasia and Christian. Christian is this billion dollar CEO and Anastasia who is a recent college graduate. I do suggest anyone who reads this book to have an open mind. Yes it takes place in 2011, so what! Don't take this book so literally. Just read it and let your imagination go wild!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|With the Old Breed is an excellent read and gives a better historical insight into the HBO mini series The Pacific and to the life experiences of Eugene Slege. As he writes you can feel his turmoil grow for the horrors of war.<br /><br />An excellent must read companion to the HBO mini series The Pacific  .
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I loved this book. As soon as I was done I wanted to know what was next and bought the third one.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Good movie to watch but sometimes things go so slow that you might fall asleep. The cinematography is awesome and so is the background score.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Simple and easy to use app. Always works great. I love pinterest so this app makes it convenient for me.
0345803493|1.0|After my dentist and his assistant convinced me to read Fifty Shades and saying the second book was much better than the first, I finally downloaded them to my Kindle.  The first book was \\"entertaining\\" in parts, and I got through it, hoping for something better in the way of intelligent writing in the second book.  Fifty Shades Darker was terrible!  After reading that Christian \\"ran his hand through his hair\\" about fifty times in the first fifty pages, I deleted it from my Kindle.  The writing is just plain awful. Anastasia Steele is not even close to being a believable character or one that any smart woman can like. The story begins with Ana pining away because she hasn't had Christian in five days; FIVE WHOLE DAYS, people!!  Don't bother to read this, if you're looking for any sort of a good read.  You'll be sorely disappointed.  Why is this on any best seller list, I don't get it!  One can take only so much repetition, with EVERYTHING that happens.  Ugh, I can't say anything good about this book. If I could give it no stars, I would!  And by the way, book 2 is a repeat of book 1, as far as I can tell.  Don't buy it.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Its fun but I feel like I have to spend too much time saying no I don't want to connect via facebook.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i like it it work perfectly in my kindle  fire. its addicting and the best thing is that is free
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books were amazing. I couldn't put them down. I read day and night. I would recommand the books to anyone who likes romantic novels. I can't wait to read more of her books.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Couldn't put it down. So much fascinating history! It gave me much more insight into the personalities, strengths and weaknesses of the various presidents.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|The application itself is beautiful and well equipt to contend with higher end mobile photo aplications.<br /><br />The problem that I'm having is something that should be simple. I can't save my photos. I can share them to twitter or Facebook but they will not save to my gallery.<br /><br />Please fix this and make it possible for me to share to other applications from this app itself.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Interesting book for this category and interesting enough to make me want to read the last of the series.  a little like the hunger game series though
0446547573|5.0|I have read many of his books and am never disapointed! This is truely a remarkable story of pain, love and trust!!!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book was chosen by our book club and I thought it would be another not so good book, but I was surprised, well written, good story, many twists and turns.
B005LLSNNE|3.0|Well, watched most of Season One with interest. Left off in Season 2 when the violence seemed priority. Then picked up season 3 on Netflix to watch while exercising. Bought season 4 so I can follow plot in upcoming Season 5.<br /><br />Just OK
B007TML4EI|4.0|So far I have liked every Jundroo game that I have tried, but every single one of them (all three currently on the Amazon marketplace) suffer from (almost) all the same issues. They are all physics based build puzzlers that run on (virtually) the same engine, have a plethora of false five star reviews, include annoying pop up ads, network permissions, and even ask for your e-mail. Even though there are a lot of negatives, I still like these games because they are just fun - and this one manages to fix a few issues I found with Simple Physics.<br /><br />Dummy Defense revolves around protecting your dummy (Melvin) while often killing his nemesis (Kelvin). This is done through clever use of blueprints to construct all sorts of defenses from bridges to forts, and saving your dummy from a multitude of objects such as boulders, trains, weapons, and even hail.<br />This is all presented extremely well with good graphics and a really easy object editor.<br /><br />Like in his other game (Simple Physics), there are ways to simply mess around with your creation. This includes blowing it up with bombs, tearing it apart with your fingers, or even spawning more dummies. I had quite a bit of fun just building forts that were outside the level specifications and seeing how much damage I could cause by blowing them up. I really wish there was a freeplay mode, with the whole level as your blueprint. That would add quite a bit of replay value to this already meaty game.<br /><br />Just like with all other games Andrew created with this engine, there is no sound here - whatsoever. Music, sound effects, and even background noises are all missing.<br /><br />Since this game also saves all your blueprints, its size gets to be pretty large. With 57 levels spread across two campaigns (quite a HUGE improvement over his previous games), the app does end up taking quite a bit of your space. After clearing every level, my total storage used is just over 45 MB. I assume the size increases withevery level cleared, but I can't confirm this since I only checked it when it was first installed, and then after I beat it.<br />----Developer note start---<br />The size of this app should always be at around 45MB after the game is uncompressed. It has nothing to do with how many levels you clear.<br />----Developer note end---<br /><br />The pop up ads are still there, one asking you for your e-mail address, and the other about purchasing Simple Physics - BUT if you decline the offer, they do not come back - ever. I left the app running for hours and restarted it multiple times. So it's not quite as annoying as it previously was. A BIG thumbs up here.<br /><br />The false five star reviews are also back. When will people stop resorting to such shady tactics? It's not that difficult to spot a perfect review from a user that only has one or two others under their belt, and all this does is lower the credibility of whatever thing is being reviewed.<br /><br />The leaderboards (that are the reason network permissions are required here) do NOT work. Multiple times I have placed in the top 15 for the day, only to not see my entered name displayed in it's proper spot. This is a big problem for me. I consider network permissions in a single player game a big issue, and using a non working leaderboard as an excuse to have them in there makes me a bit suspicious. I checked the leaderboards quite a few times, and even though my money spent was lower than some of the top 15 players, my name never made it onto them (even though the game told me I placed in the top 13 or 12). I am guessing they only update once every few hours, or even less. Maybe Andrew can clear that up for me.<br />I even tried using different names to try and get something posted to the board, but to no avail.<br />There is also another inherent problem with the leaderboard. Looking at the \\"all time\\" scoreboard, a few levels have nothing but the same monetary values listed as the top 15 scores. So even ifyou achieve the same score, you will not make it there because the spots are already filled up.<br /><br />All problems aside, this game is very, very good. If it wasn't for the network permissions, an ad for Simple Physics (placed on the campaign select), and the annoying one time pop ups - this would be a five star game.<br />It is still worth the $.99 that Jundroo, LLC is charging for it, and it is certainly worth the download as yet another good FAOTD! So go ahead and get it, you won't be sorry.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Ayo what sup this Is Christopher Gonzalez and I approve this game.  It's worth the download + its free. One of the best games on my kindle fire
034580404X|5.0|I had noticed that this book was getting a lot of hype, so I decided that reading it would be a good decision.  I was completely right! The author manages to make one engage in the story as if they are in it.  After I had finished the trilogy I almost felt lonely. The books were my life for two days.  I highly recommend these books!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a very good book, a fitting end to the series.  I hated to put it down and wish the saga of Anastasia and Christian could have kept going.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was a wonderful book...Cheryl Strayed is in every sense a \\"real\\" person.  Flawed, shattered, burdened with the results of bad decisions and bad luck.  But she is also a marvelous human being. Strong, deeply caring, and possessed of a great writing talent.  I felt like I was her silent companion every single day on the PCT.  I was elated when we beat some new obstacle...snow, fallen trees, bears...and I was crushed on those rare occasions when we had to compromise because the challenge was too great.<br /><br />I almost never read a book twice but this is one I will consider for a few years from now.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is frackin amazingly Awesme with a capital a. John Green is my favorite author and he never fails me. I highly highly HIGHLY recommend to read this. Its undoubtfully beutiful.
030758836X|4.0|This isn't the genre that I usually read, but I ended up plowing through this book in three short sessions.  It was well written, intense & had great twists and turns that kept me interested.  Definitely worth a read!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed this book alot. It held my interest to the end. There were exciting parts that you never new what was going to happen next.
B00065MDSG|5.0|My personal favorite in the KC discography, plus the CD quality is great! Highly recommended to anyone that doesn't own it. A truly awesome experience hearing the entire album the first time (of course, if you can handle this kind of raw music, or have an open mind about music)
B0071BY2OG|5.0|The video is exactly what it says in the description. It covers a great deal of the 2010 MotoGP season and interviews a number of riders. It highlights a lot of the 2010 race action, but also goes back into previous seasons to reflect on some of Rossi's battles with current and former rivals. There is also a brief interview with Masao Furusawa. I do wish there was a little more with him though, and other engineers.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|brings back the memories.  can I caulk the wagon and float it across the river?  hunting is still a lot of fun too.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This film is so engaging and sweet in the midst of the horrors of the times and setting.  So uplifting and beautifully done. It is not an easy film to watch at times, but worth every second ultimately. The overwhelming love and dedication and character of this man will make you cry, but also laugh.  Not hopeless or maudlin, but ever full of dignity, heart, spirit and tenacity.  I love this movie, and every time I see it, it gives me hope and lifts my heart and soul that such people exist.
B006LSZECO|3.0|this story starts out strong, with lots of good character development.  it continues in this fashion for quite awhile. this story became repetive, and the ending was not as well developed as it could have been.  I got the kindle edition from Amazon.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|This book made me very sad: almost like a Camus piece of work. It is well written and the metaphors, especially detailing the surrounding landscape in Montana and Canada, are superb. Throughout the reading, I constantly felt compelled to bring in something optimistic especially in the life of Dell's sister and his mother (she was so unhappy, yet her life was full of potential). But that is Ford's intent (I think)-- both characters Ford symbolizes similar to hollow persons needing a spark somewhere to ignite, but yet impossible. Arthur also is a character out of Camus.  The only inspirational character was Flo, who like Nancy in Oliver Twist, wants to assist Dell just because she likes him and enjoys his humanity. Ford has a way with linking human nature and failings to Nature herself: Almost a Pantheistic balance. Kudos for an excellent piece of work--the reader almost wants to see what the future holds for Dell and what happened to his dad.
B008FTAAG2|1.0|This is one of the worst bands and albums I have ever heard and it gives women artists a bad name. She sounds like total crap. I can't believe she does this for a living. I like every type of music imaginable, besides the terrible screeching of this wretched woman.
B006YC74E8|4.0|I absolutely love this app!  I just wish that there was a version available for my PC because I now find myself doing all of my photo editing on my phone.  It does everything from simple cropping and color corrections to adding text, rotating images, and even layering photos so that you can use your own photos to create fun frames for other photos. Love it!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This is a great movie!  I do suggest, as I did, read the book 1st!  More back stories and fill in then in movie!  Waiting on the edge of my set for #2!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just absolutely love this app, it's an easy way to get on my favorite site, I don't have to sit at the computer for hours anymore, I can be on Pinterest almost anywhere now!
B000FCK42M|4.0|Based on actual events is a great way of understanding War on Drugs and the rise of mexican cartels. Deep and carefully crafted characters and a moving story. It has some flaws in historical accuracy and mexican idiomatic expressions but nevertheless an excelent novel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its an awesome game that takes a turn on some of the classic arcade games and its hours of fun for everyone to play
1452110581|5.0|I received this as a gift, and immediately read it, then read it again, then promptly ordered two more copies to give to friends and family.  I suppose I could re-gift my copy but I just cannot bear to have it leave my side at the moment.  I find myself looking at my cats and composing a poem that they might pen.  And I find myself laughing when I recognize that with their antics they could have written a couple of these poems themselves.  What a remarkable author to offer this insightful little tribute and laugh-out-loud perfect gift.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I thought the story line was ok. However, the sex was a bit much. A male would have needed to be superman to perform the way he did.
0786955570|5.0|I've had a lot of fun playing with with the solo quest or with friends. Some of the adventures can be quite challenging but I think is what makes it fun. There are also additional adventures you find online to help extend the life of the game.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like to read the NASB version of the Bible and this product has it and many other versions available. It has many great features including bookmarking, highlighting and note taking to enhance your Bible study. However, the program does not download the Bible versions to the Kindle's memory so if you are not near a wi fi location it doesn't work. This makes it useless as a full time Bible, which is why I am only rating it ok.
B008GOAFBQ|2.0|KISS - DESTROYER(RESURRECTED) - RATING 1<br /><br /> As it was originally listed HERE in amazon, this should've been 2 cds. One with the remix of the original recording and then the mix that is in the CD in this package. Just like the remastered version of DEEP PURPLE - MACHINE HEAD. You have the original remastered version and then the ROGER GLOVER mix which blows away the original version.<br /><br />This is what BOB EZRIN and the record company should've done here. It is great because you get to hear parts that were originally recorded that are not in the original version. However; when you hear the RESURRECTED version, is kind of like the appetizer and you don't get to eat the main course.<br /><br />PROS - Thanks to Pro Tools and today's technology the original FLAT mix, now sounds much BIGGER. It has a lot more BOTTOM like analog tapes. A lot of the parts are brought forward like Gene Simmon's bass and overall is a far superior job than the original version of 1975. But us fans were left out in the cold, we should've had this and the original version remixed for a perfect KISS package that would've been cherished by the demanding KISS fans.<br /><br />CONS - Universal Music and Bob Ezrin missed the bus by not giving us a second CD of the original version newly mixed & remastered, so you get on here just an appetizer of one of the most important recordings in KISS career.<br />This is in lame terms a PLAN B of DESTROYER.<br /><br />NOTE - If you like DEEP PURPLE, get the double cd of the remastered version of MACHINE HEAD so you can hear what this should've been! http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Head-Dlx-Deep-Purple/dp/B00000DGRX/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1347201938&sr=8-2&keywords=deep+purple+machine+head+40th<br /><br />RAY ST JOHN

B008BIN9EW|5.0|I love this game and I suggest it to everyone who likes to play games like chess, heroes of might and magic, or even games like starcraft. You will like this game even more as soon as you start playing online.<br /><br />Eu recomendo esse jogo, somos poucos Brasileiros no momento, mas já vejo alguns bem posicionados no ranking, vamos lá pessoal, vamos jogar.
B007TMON8M|5.0|This game is an awesome change from the endless bridge building variants.  I love the creative tasks that you're given to do.  The graphics are good and the physics are realistic. Gameplay is very fun. Well worth the low price.
B001V5CIHQ|4.0|It is fun to remember being a kid again... where one's imagination knew no limits. A family favorite tale told in a fun way to be enjoyed by a wide audience. Keep in mind it is a kid friendly film so it will be cheesy but if you know that going into the film then I think you will enjoy it more.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|Excellent movie with great action from beginning to end.  This is truly a must see if you plan on seeing other Batman movies.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I get to the log in screen on my kindle but I can't get the keyboard up to log in via email. useless.
B001F12J0C|5.0|ALL THREE MOVIES WERE EXCELLENT. THERE WERE SO MUCH ACTION THAT KEPT YOU ON YOUR SEAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TRILOGY TO ANYONE WHO LIKE ACTIONS MOVIES.
B007TML4EI|5.0|This is clever. The bridge building thing had really gotten boring and everyone had done a variation of it. Now we get some new innovative physics based construction games. The character is cute, the graphics are good, the scenarios are fun, and the physics feel plausible. What a pleasant relief from the series of low quality free apps lately. This one and the physics game yesterday really stand out. Well worth the regular price if you're buying after the deal is over.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|OK...I'm a 54 year old gay white male and I had no interest in reading these books but too many of my friends (male and female) told me I should give the first one a shot. Bought \\"Shades\\" on my Kindle. The writting is awful...elementary if you really want to know...here's my problem...how come I couldn't put it down and as soon as I finished book one, I imediately bought book two and am just about to go out on my balcony and finish it and then buy book three! Pure trash, absolutely puuuuuure trash but I can't put them down! Kudos to the author who I saw in an interview, I think on 60 Minutes.
0307956350|4.0|Kate is a CIA agent who has always kept the true story of what she does a secret from her husband, Dexter.  When he receives a job offer from a bank in Luxembourg, it seems the right time to leave her job, enjoy spending time with her young children and get to know Europe.  Adapting to life as an expat in Luxembourg isn't always easy.  Her husband works long hours, she struggles with the language barriers and the tedium of everyday life.  When she meets a fellow American expat, Julia, she initially is delighted to make a new friend.  But gradually she starts to wonder about why Julia and her husband Bill are so interested in her life and realizes that they are not entirely what they seem to be.  At the same time she starts to wonder why her husband is so mysterious about what his job entails and why he travels so much.<br /><br />The books starts slowly and it was intriguing me without really grabbing me, but somewhere around the 75 page mark I realised that I was hooked.  It's not a fast paced thriller - it's rich in atmosphere and by that I mean that you get details about how Kate fills her days and what all the places she visits in Europe are like.  Having been an expat wife myself in Europe, I really related to this part of the novel and felt that it was very accurate.  The book also abruptly jumps forward in time a couple of years, revealing some things that Kate doesn't yet know in the main story.  So as a reader you're kind of unravelling the mystery from two ends, which is a little annoying to start with but becomes compelling by the end.<br /><br />While I did feel disappointed that the ending wrapped up so neatly, I genuinely enjoyed this story about a former spy turned expat housewife having to use her spycraft skills to work out what's really going on.  It's clever, it's quite original and it kept me guessing throughout.
B00785P2QC|5.0|love it. I build where ever I want.<br />must buy. my daughter plays allllllllll the time on my kindle 2
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 1 was hot but poorly written.<br />This one is still not a masterpiece but you can definitely tell that they spent much more time during the editing stages of this book.<br /><br />It flows a lot better.<br />There is still a lot of hot stuff but overall this one has a better story line.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars because I think there's nothing wrong with seeing something for what it is.<br />This book is mental candy.
B00932AA5G|4.0|Good thriller from Norway and worth the rent. Just enough plot twists to keep you guessing and entertained for 1hr 40min. Glad I rented it...recommended.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book kept my interest by always leaving me wanting more. It created the excitement of 50 Shades with similar characters in Gideon, she desired him as much as Ana desired Grey. I really enjoyed this book. I think Sylvia Day is a gifted writer.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Love FUN! Nate Ruess has such a wonderful voice. Great indie band. Love the variety of themes on the album, don't feel like I'm listening to the same song over and over again like some artists.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|As a parent, I always wonder if I am doing too little or too much.This boook helps you understand the difference in parenting and the effects of different method. I found the book easy to read and funny I might add. I have to admit, as a child of immigrant, my methods are different than typical western method but I don't agree that it has to be this extreme. There is a middle there somewhere. Overall really enjoyed the book.
1423140591|5.0|As our familiar demigod family starts to construct a massive war machine, Jackson wakes up from his \\"little nap\\" that apparently took away 8 months of his life. Shortly after being trained by Lupa, the wolf goddess, he is set out on a journey: days' worth of a travel to camp Jupiter, the supposedly only safe place for young demigods. The travel finds to be dangerous and though he is protected by the bath in the Styx (which he of course, doesn't know), his pursuers just seem to not die: the monsters just re-form after few moments. Only later does he and the demigods understand that the second great prophecy has started and it is Gea who opened the doors of death, and the line between life and death is withered.<br /><br />In the roman camp, Percy manages to make great new friends and enemies, and also manages to make a name for himself in the first war-game he participated. Though, sooner than I thought, they were issued with a quest to find \\"death\\" (Thanos) who was apparently chained up be the giants.<br /><br />Rick Riordan wrote this book also on the trio- perspective like its former book in the series, and I got to admit, it actually feels as if it is more mature this way, you know? But if I could ask the author this: what trio are you going to pick for the third book in the series? Some brand new groups of demigods not mentioned in the book? Or something simple like, repeating the first book again (Jason, Leo, Piper), or some random mix between two books? Is it going to be Percy, Jason, and Annabeth? Or maybe Leo, Piper, and Frank? I do not know exotically, and that is why it is so great! Just HAVE to make sure the readers read the next book, right?<br /><br />Anyway, I really enjoyed this book and I am actually looking forward to write the FIRST after-read review for the MARK OF ATHENA. Highly recommend this book to you! (even though you may be a grown-up)
B008JFUTT0|5.0|As a South African raised, with almost all my friends, on the music of Rodriguez it is almost impossible to believe that such a talent remained unrecognised in his home country.<br />This film goes some way to explaining it, but only some way. See it and buy  \\"Cold Fact\\"; better late than never.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|fascinating book and very educational about WW1. This is the third of Ken Folletts books I have read and find the research amazing. I look forward to the next in the series.
B006O3MU96|5.0|Good game extremely addicting. If you like temple run you will love this game. One of the best games I have ever bought.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|After seeing this film in an art-house theatre before it later went into wider release I loved it, and knew I would purchase it when released on DVD.  I was happy for the Oscar wins that it achieved also. Being a \\"film fanatic\\" I loved the homage to the silent film era and found only a few minutes into the film that I wasn't distracted by it being both silent and filmed in black-and-white.  I have a few films in my personal film library that are both silent and B&W and THE ARTIST takes a place of honor.<br /><br />I recommended it highly and continue to do so!  I also hope to see Du Jardin in other films.  His look transcends eras and I don't doubt that he would be equally interesting to watch in every other film genre.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|This book doesn't actually say anything other than the generic &#34;stop thinking this&#34; or &#34;don't do this, rather, do this&#34; or &#34;present your positive self&#34;. Okay, so how do I do that? An example would be lovely.<br /><br />Some of the information, experts disagree with. For instance: swinging legs is often considered a display of child like joy; rarely anger. Rolling the foot on the ball of the ankle is a form of gravity defying behavior, and will more often than not, signify happiness. And tapping of the foot can mean anything from &#34;I'm nervous and trying to calm myself down&#34; to &#34;I'm bored&#34; to &#34;I've got a lot of a stimulant in me&#34; to &#34;I'm angry&#34;. Things need to be viewed in context, not &#34;this means that&#34;. Addendum: You can find backup arguments to this in works like &#34;What EveryBODY Says&#34; by Joe Navarro, former FBI behavioral profiler, as well as in published research.<br /><br />I was only reading this over looking for a good book on the subject for a friend of mine. I honestly cannot recommend something so lacking in substance and so generic it's misleading at times. The author should strongly consider expanding on the material, and then republishing.
B008MEM24S|5.0|another hit from Disney! many challenging levels to tease your brain! kids and adults alike will run out your battery!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was nice to sit down and enjoy this for a Summer read.  I would recommend it to a friend.  Easy read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Someone recommended this book to me after I read and enjoyed The Hunger Games series. I'm glad I picked this up because the writing is excellent and clear (towering far above The Hunger Games writing, in my opinion) but has the same high-concept dystopian plot.<br /><br />The concept of this book is original and fresh yet realistic, drawing on modern realities, such as controlling populations through fear, communication and media availability, and lack of education. Each part of Wool (there are 5) shadows a different character in the \\"Silo,\\" an underground, post-apocalyptic enclosure that tunnels deep into the earth while protecting its people from the toxic outside world. Each person in the silo has an important job that contributes to silo working for everyone, much like a commune. Any \\"empty\\" jobs must be filled and each human death must be replaced with a life, procreation being a privilege that is allotted by lottery. Periodically, those in the silo who disobey the law (of never expressing a desire to leave the silo or curiosity about what may be outside) are sentenced to \\"clean\\" the outer windows of the silo, resulting in a terrible death that all inside the silo can see. The piles of decaying bones outside the silo serve as warnings and reminders for anyone else who may harbor similar thoughts. As each of the characters meets his or her fate, more truths are revealed in what turns out to be a well-woven tale. This is quite the page-turner with many topics for discussion. (My husband and I read it together but this would be a great book club choice as well!) The author is a master at whittling it down to one or two important sentences sprinkled throughout that let you jump to your own conclusions, bringing greater meaning and weight to the story. Can't wait to read more from this author, who MUST write parts 6 through 10.
B00122LXTM|2.0|Doobies had the 'hit' formula, which made them rich and famous thanks to music 'fans' short attention spans and radio marketing, but in total after all these years I'm finding their stuff formulaic and repetitive and predictable and pretty uninspired. Just my musical opinion.
B0010SKSTO|4.0|Very well written, with good pictures. Doesn't go into amazing detail about specific things, but then again, that would ruin the fun of finding those things oneself. Very good for an introductory peice to reading others. Just don't expect to get good at it overnight; it takes a lot of skill.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Very fun puzzle game.  Perfectly playable whether it's on a 5 minute break or for hours.  No glitches/bugs spotted in about 10 hours of playing.
B001OL4TR4|4.0|This film was the wonderful story of a classically well-done myth, right down to basing the climax on an eclipse.  There was the flaw that the moon shown the evening before the eclipse was the wrong lunar phase, and then there was the music!  This romantic, mystical story with cinematography reflecting this mood, had peculiarly loud \\"fight scene\\" music that blasted forth destroying the overall feel.  Ah well, it probably worked for 13 year old boys who watched to lust over Michelle Pfeiffer.
B007TML4EI|5.0|the objective of the game is just to protect a dummy from all sorts of crazy things . I just played 11 levels on my EVO 3d and game was reponsive , graphics are decent , it has a slow motion to help you figure out where your design is broken ...great thinking game .. don't know why it needs internet access  ?  but besides I can't find anything wrong.. great FAOD nice change from those word games
B004V9MU86|5.0|A book that is narrated by Death. But Death is not dark but takes you on a journey with the life of a little Jewish girl in Nazi Germany.  It is different kind of book I would normally read. Recommended by my Daughter she is doing a English literature study at her High School. I would recommend to others and apparently a movie may be made. But you can't beat a great book and this one is.<br />A book for all ages.
