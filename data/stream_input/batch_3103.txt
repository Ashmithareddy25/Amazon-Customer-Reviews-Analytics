B00FXEL00W|4.0|Great read! Enjoyed it very much. Had to finish it once I started it. Will look for more books from K Zimmer.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|No plot, love Brad Pitt but this movie was ridiculous even if you like zombies. Not worth even the sale of 99 cents
B00AW28HF6|4.0|Suspenseful and well thought out story.  Good characters and character development.  I got lost in some of the the detail, but on the other hand, the detail is part of what makes this a good read.  For spy and intrigue enthusiasts you should definately check out this new author's work.
B00EKJWS1Q|1.0|Its slow and it has pop up adds and just doesn't work very good. I don't like the app at all.
0694003611|5.0|It's a classic!  This book has been around for as long as I can remember, so I wanted my son to have it.
0061452068|5.0|This was one of the 2 or 3 most enjoyable books I have read in a decade!  A very entertaining romp through human history, tackling multiple  assumptions head-on as he goes.  Too many great qualities to enumerate, so suffice it to say that it should tickle one's consciousness on multiple occasions.
1451666179|5.0|I wasn't sure how the blog would translate to book form, but it works.  The new material is wonderful, and I was stoked to re-read the older material while in the kitchen/bathroom/other non-computer places.  It's also nice to be able to loan it to the, um, older members of my family who do not read blogs, but really appreciate the art and writing.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|it is fun not the funnest game but its time consumming and its pretty fun my family likes it to
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I am normally not a huge fan of &#34;comic&#34; type movies, but I really enjoyed this movie and can't wait to see the new one that I see is coming out.
B001OKGV6W|5.0|A true classic.  Superbly written, directed, cast, and acted.  A great story, especially for anyone interested in the intellectual aspects of the arguments of science vs faith.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Very well done.  I love the story, it is thought provoking and enjoyable to think of Shakespeare in a different light.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|My favorite movie of all times! I watched it so many times, but I still cry at the end! I totally recommend it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game us ok I mean it's fun and all and it starts out easy and then gets HARD that y I'm doing this review haha I needed more coins
1937053571|5.0|This is honestly probably the best series of books I've read this year. Like everyone else I did not expect it to end the way it did. But like someone else said, it was better than what I expected. This is an amazing author. She is so incredibly creative. I honestly don't know how she thinks these stories up! I would definitely recommend the Covenant series to my friends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I hated putting the book down and couldn't wait to open it up and start reading again.  A must read!
B0017R5UA0|5.0|An absolutely beautiful album!  The arrangements and harmonizing done here are landmark.  They've even included the Sun Giant EP (also on vinyl) in the package.  What more could you ask for?  Ice cream, perhaps, but that might get your nice, new record all sticky.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|In my opinion this is the best zombie show if not the best show ever on cable television and think everyone should watch it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is so good I read it in just 3 days that's how good this book is now it's one to the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I really like the game, but it is frustrating to try and move levels, you either have to pay or beg your friends for help, I wait forever for friends to allow me to move up or I just pay, it really isn't fair to constantly charge money all the time
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Was a gift for a family member and she loves it.  She has raved about it for past two days.....GREAT product!
B00A9T1HUO|1.0|New style of music - I didn't like it. Josh has shifted and I don't like the way he headed.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Something like chicken soup for the artist soul.  Good advice & insightful at time. I would recommend this book for a gift or coffee table book.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|Don't get it. If you have it uninstall it. The only thing it does is report the broadcasted DISCs in range.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wonderful family & community life in 2 small towns in England about 100 years ago. The people pull together not only in celebrations but also in family crisis. Brendan Coyle from 'Downton Abbey' ~ Mr. Bates ~ portrays the father of the main character in this series.  'Lark Rise to Candleford' is a continuing story that is  Delightful & HIGHLY Recommended!  Wish there were more than 4 seasons!
B00BIPKROU|5.0|This show is smart, funny, and tells a good story! Love it!! The guest stars really add a different aspect to the episode and I look forward to see who will be showing up!

B008JFUPOY|4.0|Disney•Pixar’s first prequel plays around a little with the mythology of the Monsters (which is fully explained in the fine audio commentary), brings Mike Wazowski more to the forefront and ups the onscreen creature ante from about 25 to more than 250.<br /><br />Many have opined that Monsters University cannot pack the emotional punch of its predecessor. Let’s face it, without an adorable little girl like Boo, the emotional is at least different if not as intense.<br /><br />Mike is actually a more sympathetic character than Sully, who has had everything handed to him throughout life and learns that effort is necessary to really succeed. We also get a few origin stories, particularly focusing on creep-in-the-making Randall.<br /><br />Too many recent animated features seem to have a checklist approach to the supporting characters, rehashing “types” rather than coming up with something new. Not so here, with such new friends as middle-aged Don, the kind of guy you might meet in night school.<br /><br />The voice cast is, as always, impeccably cast with recognizable names chosen for what they bring to the characters and story, as well as the best Hollywood voice actors rounding out the ensemble.<br /><br />Randy Newman’s score is a little different from what one might typically expect. There’s quite a bit of the college pep rally sound – and a main theme that reminds me of John Williams’ theme to Steven Spielberg’s 1941.<br /><br />Like the best Pixar Blu-ray packages, this one is loaded with superb extras, so much so that I have annotated the list. You can really get a feel for the creative process at the studio, minus the “look where we get to go” feeling that some other features seem to engender among those who will never trod in the same footsteps. Instead, the Pixar staff shows their human side in a way that is sure to affect many an aspiring, struggling person of any age. Even Don.<br /><br />Blu-ray Bonus Features<br />• The Blue Umbrella (short)<br />• Audio Commentary<br />• Campus Life: Dan Scanlon and the staff in a typical day at Pixar during the making of Monster University<br />• Story School: Very interesting examination of how the story for Monsters University was developed<br />• Scare Games: Pixar employees play games as a group to get to know each other and create the atmosphere of the monster scare games<br />• Monthropology: Examines the vast array of monster types that inhabit this film and how many more there are (by the hundreds) than there were in Monsters, Inc.<br />• Welcome to MU: The archway that leads into the campus and overall set design of the film<br />• Music Appreciation: Randy Newman, the orchestra and music team, speaking a language only musicians understand, create the musical score<br />• Scare Tactics: The acting aspect of animation and how the animators paralleled the monsters learning their craft in the film<br />• Color and Light: Meticulous details about how color and light are created to accent the characters and scenes<br />• Paths to Pixar - Monster U Edition: Members of the film’s creative and administrative team talk about their first jobs, striuggles and failures that formed their journey of life and career, emphasizing that it’s never easy and the path is never clearly mapped out<br />• Furry Monsters: A Technical Perspective – How the monster hair creation developed over the years and an easy to understand look at how it was done for this film<br />• Deleted Scenes: A staggering amount of very entertaining animatics for scenes that were great but just didn’t fit into the movie. I especially like the drama class skit.<br />• Promo Picks: Original animated snippets that appeared as short promos<br />• Set Flythroughs: First person camera-style journeys through the settings (sort of the like the opening shots of The Sound of Music). A really nice extra feature because you see so much more than was possible within theactual film<br /><br />DVD Bonus Features<br />• The Blue Umbrella (short)<br />• Audio Commentaryactual film<br /><br />DVD Bonus Features<br />• The Blue Umbrella (short)<br />• Audio Commentary

B004EWFUQY|5.0|Easy to use, it's not really a diet so much as a plan for eating to get the weight off quickly.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|good product. i have bought a few anker batteries and am pleased with all of them. i would recommend this to a friend. solid value..
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Perfect gift for a &#34;Potterhead&#34;! Amazing price for the full set. So glad I waited for the set rather than buy them individually.
B0094K1MH2|2.0|Too much blood and gore, much more than the trailer showed. Amazing animation though. It would definitely frighten little children.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. The music is enthralling; the location, breathtaking; the story, incredibly true; and the acting, superb. It is my wish for everyone to see it. But don't turn it off when the credits begin - there's one more chilling scene.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|It was easy to get it and I have my book ready inmideatelly to use. I love the dictionary aplication. I wish you can give better prices so I could buy more often.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|BEWARE, this product does very LIttle and not very WELL.  If you have a SMART TV you do not need this ITEM until they Google updates it to cover more movie sites like HBO GO, XFINITY.  All you get is Netflix (and YouTube) so if you use a roku or xbox ect, you are better off staying with those.  You can only stream from Google CHROME browser (not my favorite).  It is Jerky the Audio and Video are off.  If you WANT YouTube and do not care about Quality then this is perfect.  If you have a smart TV all of that is likely included. I am disappointed. PRO:  It is easy to install!
B00CSYR432|5.0|From Up on Poppy Hill is another great effort by Studio Ghibli. This picture shows that the Ghibli organization will continue on after Hayao Miyazaki fully retires. This is a completely enjoyable picture. The story is engaging and the characters are well developed.
B00E25RD68|5.0|This movie is an incredible event. It really stays with you after it is over because the story is so strong.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book ever written, engaging makes you fall in love and hate the characters.  Suzanne Collins makes this book so visual and you just feel like you are there in Panema with them.  I have suggested this it friends and they are ALL addicted, catching was by far one of the best books I have ever read in my life witch.  Btw I am only in sixth grade.  I suggest it for avid readers in 6 and up also can't wait for the movie! PANEMANAC!!!!

B008YRVW0I|2.0|I love the game and it works great on my kindle, but after so many free games then it will no longer play another game until you join up for more emails etc.  I just want a game to play---no attachments.<br /><br />Or let me buy the game and be done.

B005544TRQ|4.0|The show has clever twists and subtle humor. The dual protagonists deal with an array of office politics and issues, and the backdrop of the law practice provides that new issues come in the door with each client. The show has lots of eye candy of all types- gorgeous women, handsome men, New York City architecture and other interesting views. The photography in the show is extremely good, with great lighting and stunning views.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|A great fun family movie - even though I watched this as a kid a MILLION times, I'm actually shocked at how much sexual nuances there are - some not so subtle. All the sexual things (save one backseat scene and one drive-in scene) are words only, so little kids won't get it, but older ones have heard far worse (sadly).  All in all, a fun time.  Who doesn't love a musical?
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is the best read I have had in ages! Beautifully written, compelling, surprising and utterly believable. Move over, Holden Caufield.
B0058PJ6NE|5.0|Excellent for downloading anything.  I use this app to find artist I love and download their songs.  I can just watch them perform as well.  I love this app more than anything I have downloaded.  This is wonderful.

B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Excellent book that delves into the complex political and cultural landscape that led to the shooting of Malala. It shows there is hope for education for girls in world that seems at times seems very hopeless given the forces at work and the vacuum of leadership in the region.
B00BU9DXAY|5.0|Total dog person and I loved the observations which are spot on, wonderfully illustrated, and irreverent. Looks great on kindle fire, formats weird on regular kindle though.

B00CYFGCOW|5.0|OK to start off here's some quick answers for those wondering in all their reviews:<br /><br />1 - It CAN be turned off. Pull & hold the tail for about 5 seconds. Furby will yawn & go to sleep, & stay that way until shaken or the tail pulled again. Other Furbys won't wake it.<br /><br />2 - Yes, only Booms will work with the Boom app. However quite a few sections of the old (2012) app will work with Boom as well, adding quite a bit more fun to the Boom<br /><br />3 - It IS easy to 'set' what personality you want. Repeatedly feed for the \\"foodie\\" (I call him fat Furby). Repeatedly turn upside down for evil, swing from one foot for hyper, play lots of music for diva, & repeatedly tickle to change to the last personality. It takes about a minute or so doing the action to get it to change.<br /><br />4 - For those \\"adults\\" that get annoyed with Furbish, my 12 yr old learned what their words mean in one day. A 12 yr old. There's some translations on the fold-out that came with Boom, & both apps have dictionaries/translators. Boom will also 'learn' more English the more you play with it. My kids have had there's since early September & they speak more English than Furbish.<br /><br />5 - When you need to change batteries push the small 'reset' button for 2 seconds before closing it up. This will make sure all sensors work properly. It will not reset its personality or the progress it made towards speaking English or remembering other Furbys.<br /><br />Hope this helps you or your children get the most enjoyment out of a great toy!<br /><br />We own a peacock, black/pink triangle, & black/white zigzag Booms
B0010SKUYM|5.0|It started out very slow but after it picked up and the story started things get interesting fast. It's a fresh tale and mix of science, magic and adolescent adventure that is well worth a read!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It's fun and a little challenging for kids. Down side is it does not update when it should making it hard for the kids to keep up.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I bought this item for my daughter as a gift. I was very satisfied on how quickly  this item came.
1250030951|5.0|Coming up with the words to write this review has mostly been impossible. Nothing I could ever tell you about my experience with this book could give justice to how much I utterly love and adore and want to live within its pages. I've read dozens of amazing contemporary books this year,  that I've loved to an insane extent, but&lt;strong> Fangirl &lt;/strong>is the moon and stars and sun and ocean of books. I definitely fall into the camp of considering this a new adult book and it's everything that I want new adult books to be. A beautiful, heart warming, realistic, and relatable story that explores family, love, friendship and self-exploration in a truly unforgettable story.<br /><br />There have been a lot of characters that I've related to this year, but none have resonated with me as much as Cath. An introvert who hides behind her computer screen and refuses to let anyone into her carefully built walls after her mother walks out on her family, there were times where reading about Cath was almost like looking in a mirror, in both good and bad ways. Part of Cath's charm is that she is so obviously a flawed character. She's equal parts funny, sweet, talented and caring as well as stubborn, self-absorbed and naive. It often feels as if she cares more about the fictional universe she writes fanfic for then the universe she's living in, and really haven't most of us been there? She is just so likable that seeing her character grow and step outside of that comfort zone had me cheering for her the entire time. REALLY HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE AND CHEER FOR A CHARACTER WHO HAS KANYE DANCE PARTY'S ON HER BAD DAYS?<br /><br />The writing is what I've come to expect from Rowell. You know, utter perfection. I loved the pacing and the way the story encompassed the entirety of her freshman year and all of the stories developments on a realistic timeline. Nothing felt rushed or like Cath changed her entire personality miraculously overnight. I love it when contemps get that right. The writing was smart, witty, poignant and 100% engaging. The story made me so incredibly nostalgic for my own freshman year of college, and made me remember a lot of things I thought I'd forgotten. It even gave me the urge to dig out all of my old journals that I have buried in storage somewhere. It was so realistic and engaging that I felt as if I was living the year right alongside Cath and the other characters.<br /><br />The one thing I really was not a huge fan of was all the excerpts of Cath's fan fiction. I understand it's purpose, especially the way it brings Cath and Levi together and such, but sometimes I felt like there was just a little too much. The short bits weren't so bad, but the super long parts that Cath reads to Levi drove me crazy. I didn't care about the fictional Simon Snow world (although yes, if this was a real series I would totally be all over it), I cared about Cath's. I did think the reading aloud to Levi thing was adorable though. My best friend actually read Harry Potter &amp; the Deathly Hallows aloud to her husband, so when I read about that it made me think of that and smile because they are the most adorable couple I know.<br /><br />While the focus of the story is Cath's self-exploration, her relationship with her family is a huge part of that. Naturally I related to her relationship with her sister and dad way more than I should have. Cath is completely thrown for a loop that her twin, Wren, doesn't want to be roommates. Wren and Cath, while sharing the Simon Snow love, are pretty much complete opposites in every way and the distance that grows between them when they start college, even though they are going to the same school, obviously hurts both of them and I really loved seeing that dynamic explored. I don't have a twin (although I've always wished I did because I totally always wanted to be the evil twin when I was a kid-thank you Sweet Valley High), but I do have a cousin whose only six months younger than me and is more like my sister than my cousin and we went through a similar phase when we went into high school and it was utterly devastating for me. Watching Cath go through that with Wren brought all of that back to the forefront and I loved seeing the sisters find that balance again, even if I didn't particularly like Wren's character.<br /><br />I also loved that Rowell actually created realistic parent/child relationships and explored them. Despite the fact that Cath is away at college and doing her own thing, her relationship with both parents, for better or worse, was definitely very present in the story. Also her mother is a horrible human being. As much rage as I felt at her for abandoning her family, I think I felt even more rage at her giving her kids weird names because she was too lazy to think of a second name when she found out she was having twins. I mean, Wren's not that bad but Cather? WHO DOES THAT TO THEIR CHILD? Crap moms, that's who.<br /><br />Of course the book has a totally glorious romance because Rowell is amazing at that. LEVI IS MY EVERYTHING. During my freshman year, I super bonded with my RA. I think he mostly took pity on me because my roommate was horrible and I was obviously lonely and socially awkward, but he was kind of my hero that year and I was half in love with him. He was just a truly good guy and helped bring me out of my shell more than I might have without him. Plus he let me sleep on the couch in his dorm room when my roommate stumbled in loud and drunk or insisted on sleeping with the TV on. Man, I miss that guy. Anyway, tangent aside,  Levi reminded me of him so freaking much it made me sad and nostalgic and so so feelsy. I loved his character so much and the development of his and Cath's relationship was so beautiful and perfect just thinking about it makes my heart sing. It was the perfect-slow burn and even when Levi did some thing that made me want to junk punch him, he still held my heart. Seriously Cath, if you don't someday marry him, I will. Because that is totally a possible thing.<br /><br />As much as I love Levi and relate to Cath, Reagan was probably my favorite character. Her smart-ass ways and brutal honesty just spoke to me and I loved the balance she brought to Cath and the way she helped bring her out and obviously genuinely cared, even when she didn't want to.<br /><br />As a sidebar, and not that anyone probably cares but I feel like mentioning it because I've seen it mentioned by lots of people, while reading the book I think I figured out why Rowell uses a fictional fandom rather than Harry Potter, which Simon Snow is obviously pulled from. She actually kind of gives us the answer when Cath and her professor discuss the difference between fan fiction and plagiarism and Cath argues that it's not plagiarism if she's not profiting of it. If Rowell had used Harry Potter, and still included the excerpts of the fan fiction Cath wrote then technically she'd be profiting off of HP fan fiction which would technically be plagiarism. Yes. I thought about it too much but at least its sensible.<br /><br />So yea. I guess I liked Fangirl. And think you should probably read it too. And if you actually read this monster of a review and all my crazy tangents, thanks for that.e my sister than my cousin and we went through a similar phase when we went into high school and it was utterly devastating for me.

0525478817|5.0|This is one of those books, that truly moves you. You will laugh, you will cry, and everything in between. I understand the criticism from some reviewers that the protagonists don't seem like real teenagers. In a way, that's very true. But what some fail to recognize is that these characters are not your average teenagers - they have had to deal with the reality of death, at a very young age. That in itself makes you mature incredibly fast. So it seemed natural to me that these kids had a very adult view of the world.<br /><br />The writing IMO was very beautiful, raw and real. More depth and heart than your average YA novel.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I've always been a huge Star Trek fan and this movie didn't disappoint at all! I am looking forward to more of them.
030758836X|5.0|Really great read! I simply could not put it down (so much so that I brought it to work with me one day and tried to sneak in a few pages in between calls)! The fact that it is written from both Amy and Nick's perspective adds a layer of confusion (which adds to the mystery) and the cliffhangers at the end of every chapter left me wanting more. The ending was definitely satisfying and I can't wait for the movie next year!
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|A good movie not a sleeper and had two very big stars in it.  Liberace was a big entertainer and i only regret not seeing the<br />man perform in person.

B001BANK32|5.0|I have been a fan of Stephen king for many years and read many, many of his books but not The Shining. I don't know why I didn't read it but I just didn't do it. I am glad I waited until now because that made it all the more special.  It reminded me why I loved his books in the first place, the special horrors that only King could bring to you. I had never read this type of books until I read his. So I'm glad I saved this book till now.
B004RKXNDU|5.0|I haven't read the ebook as of yet but will do so this winter on vacation. Having read the paperback, twice, a number of years ago I believe that this is the very best espionage or 'spy' novel ever written. As a kid I was thrilled by James Bond et al but this is a book for the mature reader. I plan on savouring every word.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a mindless game which makes me forget about things that have gone wrong during the day. It increases my thought progress in solving problems and never giving up.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|All the songs are really good. They have captured their edginess that they had when they made Ten. Love it!
1476712042|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!!!!! I couldn't put it down til I finished it! I love Abby & Travis.. Travis is such a troubled, complex character and I couldn't get enough! I liked all the characters.. I loved seeing America & Shepleys relationship, especially against Abby & Travis's. Such contrast! I think what makes their relationship stand out is Travis's unhealthy &#34;addiction&#34; to Abby. At times I felt it was way too much... but then you were rooting for them to get together! I loved it all!! This is definitely book I'll re read numerous times because I loved it!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The Pendergast novels are so entertaining.  Every time I read a new one, I have the urge to go back to the beginning and re-read them all.  They are always action-packed and you can't help but love (hate) all the characters.
B00DUGCLY4|2.0|This game is pretty fun to begin with, but then gets boring when you have to use so many coins fir hints. You end up running out of coins and never playing again. If the hints used less coins I would have played it more than once lol.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I thought this game was a great game. It was not very challenging but still fun.I would recommend this game to others
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble's album ''To Be Loved,'' is so good ,no great. I love this guy and he can sing anything. This is a keeper for as long as I don't wear it out. I have other works by Buble and look forward to many more.  His choice of songs are masterfuly recorded and one feels like you are there at one of his performances,loved it. Bought it at Amazon I also have bought other music and many books and have enjoyed every item. Amazon is my first choice before going somewhere else.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have this feeling that the software dictates when you win.  You can strategize and plan how the candies will drop ............. and all of a sudden, striped candies will appear and you will Win !!!  Makes no sense to me ............... but , it is lots of fun !
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A wonderful story.  Shows what happens when you look on the inside of a person.  Should be require middle school reading.
B00EK0UBPU|3.0|The story was great but the book and the yarn actually finished at the end of chapter 4. Chapter 5 onwards to chapter 12 circled around to begin the story again from the beginning which I found disconcerting. I enjoyed the first 4 chapters (89% of the book) but I lost interest from chapter 5 onwards. Pity really as the story was good, well written and interesting from the historic point of view. Strange and disappointing ending though.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|It's an okay hidden object game.... like the fact there is a story line.... other then that is nothing special behind it
B006GWO5NE|5.0|All it is, is a cable at a reasonable cost that works and wears well - can not beat the combination.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I find this form note / memo very useful. I can Create color schemes.  info<br />Important to myself easily. I like the<br />Formatting of my data & the ability to<br />Save data without losing it. This is useful in note taking of the novels in my<br />Kindle library. Oh and also recipes.
B00CAZOHDO|4.0|Most of the songs are really great and make you want to dance in the car!  Music is more of  personal opinion (on what is good or bad) but overall I think this CD was very enjoyable.
1451648537|5.0|This book is absolutely superb. It packs more information into a page than many biographies offer in entire chapters. It's a treat to read.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|With great writing, great acting and a refreshingly different premise - oh, and incredible cinematography - Breaking Bad is the bomb! I find myself watching it every chance I get. Very, very clever.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|A masterpiece truly worth owning. Steven Spielberg's compelling film begins with Lincoln's decision to fight for a consitutional ammendment to ban slavery and and ends with it's passage.  Along the way we are offered distinct and subtle portraits of his cabinet - Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals - and production values that are so perfect they almost go unnoticed.  In this case, their simplicity really is the ultimate sophistication.<br /><br />But the best part is that this movie vividly reminds us about the similarities between politics and sausage - and offers hope that our contemporary polarized representatives might not be beyond rescue if we can choose the right leaders.
B0031RS2HC|3.0|An average story with a fairly obvious plot meant it was easy to put it down and read something else as well.
B001AQMBKA|5.0|The first season of Lost ended on two significant cliffhangers.  Walt being taken by the &#34;others&#34; and the opening of the hatch.  The hatch becomes the focus of the season whereas the conclusion to what happened to Walt is only partially resolved by the end of the season.<br /><br />The other big event of the season is we find out what happened to the people in the back of the plane.  They are given their own pilot episode, which also hurredly tells the story of their 48 days on the island, which leads up the their coming together with the rest of the characters.  We see that their experience on the island was much different than the other group.<br /><br />If you only like shows that keep their seasons self contained and wrap things up in a bow at the end, then Lost is not for you.  It is always introducing new elements to the story even as it is resolving other things.  There is far less character development this season, although there is still some.  The flashbacks that occurred in season 1 still carry through, and we even start to see how some of the characters paths crossed before they were marooned on the island.  The characters are also in more peril this season, both from the island and from each other.  While the core group of characters made it through season one relatively unscathed, the same cannot be said this season. The season ends on another pretty big cliffhanger, along with one big question that permeates throughout the season once the hatch is opened being answered.<br /><br />The series has very much a similar tone to what Alias had where almost every episode ends on either a cliffhanger or reveal, and sometimes both. I think it lends itself well to being watched consecutively because it is easier to follow and not have to remember where things left off after a hiatus.  The writing and acting are still top notch, and they do a good job of giving all the characters in the ensemble cast something to do, even though there are entire episodeswhere some characters never appear.<br /><br />As far as the blu rays go.  The picture and sound are great.  There is about an hour and a half or so worth of extras, as well as commentary on select episodes.  If you have the patience to stick with the story and accept you are not going to learn everything at once, you should definitely check the series out.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|good stress relief.  I try to play it every night before bedtime and on the weekends.  I love the birds destruction.
B00B5C0YOO|1.0|Get the free Sandisk Application for free.  Access many cloud storage and Facebook data in one place as well as save all your phone information.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the funniest games I have played so far as far as endless run games. It has brought me hours of fun and is so freaking addictive. I love this game and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Despicable Me and endless run games.
B0011Z0YFE|4.0|The influence of the Yoda like Stuart Price is strong in this one and see's Her Madgesty hitting the dance floor in a big way. It's all good, well produced stuff and those who've seen her live will know how she likes to 'dance up' her stuff. Apart from the one 'Kaballa'd' up funny, chanty song, this is all good stuff and sometimes manages to hit some of the highest points of her career. Take 'Hung Up' for instance. Samples Abba, infectious, fun pop music and at the end of the day, that's what Madonna is, a pop star, not a serious 'statement' artist. My personal favorite is 'Get Together' where Maddy and Pricey meld perfectly for a trancey, fun workout.<br />No, it's not your typical Madonna record, but it's about twenty thousand times better than the awful 'MDNA'.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|SO pumped I can now play on my Kindle Fire! Happy to see the addition of the app to Amazon!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Best CD Stryper has ever done worth every penny! I would recommend this CD to anyone even if your not a Stryper fan very good rock CD!
B000QJLQY4|5.0|Guy says the truth we all need to hear with humor making this both educational and entertaining! This is a must read for startups.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, however, there are a few places when there really was no need for all of the swear words, the points could have been made without them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad my favoritest game is now on the Kindle Fire!!! Now I have even more devices to play it on!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very addictive.My sister and I play all day. This is the best and is highly recommended for bingo lovers. Download it now and join us.
B009CVRQLY|1.0|Well, I bought the last pre-sold \\"Taking Chances\\" and have listened to it twice in 6 years. So I waited, and this one is not as good as her last. I bought a nice French CD of hers, and her French music is superior to this. So from e-bay, I bought \\"1 Fille & 4 Types\\" and it is far superior. JJ Goldman is a actual TALENTED song writer, and these are not of his quality. I will stay with her French songs, which are far more traditional and actually have a musical structure, to the melody. This material is herky-jerky and cacophonous. Of course her voice is beautiful, but I cannot say that about this \\"music\\". Would be better if she returned to her old style. Listen to \\"On ne Change Pas\\" or L'abandon\\", and you will hear what good music sounds like. Too bad! Re-inventing yourself often does not work. Case in point.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My toddler loves the Alphabet Aquarium!  It is a wonderful interactive puzzle app.  It includes a lot of repetition and letter names which helps her learn the letters and words while having so much fun!  We are very impressed with the bright and colorful illustrations.  My toddler loves puzzles and this gives her hours of puzzle playing fun.  It is easy for her to use on our Kindle Fire.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|This second edition to the evil dead series is pretty good. I was expecting this movie to be bad but I was surprised that it was actually good. I thought it was better than the first. I love these low budget movies I think they are a riot. all in all this is a good film. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a story of a seemingly sick mind and a women who is impressed with his money and his magnificent looks.  The story follows this couple as it becomes clear there is more to this man than his money and his looks, there is danger at every turn. Sex....oh yeah, plenty of sex, crazy sex, dangerous sex and the reader is most likely turning pages with record speed. A well written and easy to comprehend read but be prepared......and keep your spouse or partner NEARBY....believe me you.'ll know why. Now I understand why this book (and the other two sequels) are so popular; add a little sex and it's interesting; add a lot of sex and it's even better but put sex escapades on just about every page--all kinds of sex-good, bad, kinky, crazy sex and you have a winner-----three of them!
1937053571|3.0|Sentinel was nothing I ever expected and that could be a good thing, but sadly in this case, it wasn't. As a finale book, I expected Sentinel to blow my mind with it's war epicness and &#34;God Killer&#34; Mythology, but what I actually got was a flat and un-epic (?) story about two sappy lovers. What I'm trying to say is that Sentinel didn't feel like a final book in a series, it didn't have that seriousness and focus required when preparing for something huge, everything was ha ha funny to the characters and I certainly wasn't laughing with them. However, I didn't hate it (How could I? It had Seth!). Sentinel lies somewhere in the middle on my rating chart, but I will give it half a star more just because the ending made me believe that there might be a spin off for Seth. And that's a huge might be but I'm rooting for it!<br /><br />  Sentinel opens up with Alex observing the repercussions of her fight with Ares, the most visible one being the multiple permanent scars on her body. From thereon, we see Alex and the whole gang preparing for a war with Ares. Amongst those people is Seth and for the purpose of not spoiling anything, I'll only say that the change we saw in Seth's behavior was beyond commendable. The amount of sacrifice he made to right the wrongs in this book alone makes me so proud of being his supporter from the very beginning; Seth is most definitely my favorite character ever and nothing can change that! As for the romance, I could care less about it. Not that I didn't like Aiden before, but in this book specifically, he sounded very sappy (I need to find another word for that!). And I will agree to skipping all those make out scenes--which were A LOT-- because they felt oddly placed. Furthermore, I wasn't satisfied with the involvement of the secondary character, besides Deacon's humor here and there, I didn't see anything special from their side.<br /><br />  Wow, I just noticed how negative my review sounds. Well, there were some things I loved, namely the new God added in the mix. Oh, he as such a delight! He appeared as an older and more naughtier version of Seth to me, so naturally I was a fan! Other than that, I love the progress made for the half blood in this book, that's the whole issue that started this series and I was extremely happy to see it resolved for the better. All in all, Sentinel was a pretty decent ending to Covenant series, it might not be epic but it did answered all my questions and nicely wrapped up all the issues. So I can't really complain too much. Fans of this series would most definitely be satisfied with the ending in the least, though for me, the ending was the favorite part. I loved how every piece came together and gave us the ending that was shocking yet expected at the same time.namely the new God added in the mix. Oh, he as such a delight!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Why? Oh why did I start playing this darn game. It's way too fun, annoyingly exciting, and uncontrollably addicting. Thank goodness for the &quot;life&quot; breaks and friends giving me lives.  It's going to be a looonng winter. I just need to keep my kindle fire HD charged up.  I LOVE CRUSH`IN!!!!<br /><br />I am definitely NOT the queen of jelly, at least not yet. LOL.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great book, I loved everyone of the books in this series.  I watched the movies (foreign versions) but really did enjoy the books more.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|It is one of the finest films ever made, in my opinion, and it is rather interesting that it includes the director's preferred ending.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game.  I had a lot of fun figuring out how to escape.  I just wish there were more levels to play!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am addicted to Candy Crush.  I think about playing all the time,  Every spare moment.  I love the challenge of the different levels.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Awesome I loved this movie so much when I saw it that decided to buy it!!!!!!  All their movies are really good......and the books are awesome as well.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I am enjoying this but am annoyed by the constant requests for money. You pay for hints to cut off the disruptive ads. Wish I had seen how to just buy the thing outright at the beginning, which is what I wanted and still am not sure where or how to get that done.
B002WN35DC|5.0|Love this book!  I read it when I was a child, then again as a very yough adult, and now again, this is the kind of book that you will nerver outgrow...
159463176X|4.0|Characters, storylines and desires are woven together inside societal expectation. There are moments when the connection or important of the storyline is not clear but Hosseini's storytelling and ability to write the reader into the story without you noticing happens once again. An insightful book and one I highly recommend.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Another great season got one of My workers hooked on it now. so we laugh and laugh making remarks to one another about the episodes. I recommend a must get if your a fan and if you Love the cast
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I became obsessed with this amazing story. Howey brilliantly wove together a tale with stunning plot twists and characters I loved. I will definitely read DUST and SHIFT.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Enjoyed the app. It is a lot faster than the other one I had. The only trouble I had have is when I send out email it sends out 2. I checked the contacts and they were duplicated. I only checked 1 . Can you help me with this?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Woven beautifully into the world of Mr. Kings expansive world, this latest tale takes the was and once again makes it the is. loved it, loved it, loved it.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|The books main characters were Greg Heffley, Rodrick, Mrs.Heffley, Mr.Heffley, and Manny. The book was a good book. I love Diary of a Wimpy Kid books.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I pre-ordered this CD about a month back as I was that excited to get this material in my hands. I had listened to a few songs through Facebook, and was really impressed with NMHTP video. While the music is very accessible to the average fan, It also packs enough punch for someone looking for a little bit more. This is not a re-hash of an 80s hairband, but a mature effort from a veteran group. The CD starts strong with great riffs on Revelation, as Mr. Sweet shows his handiness on the fret board. And then comes my personal favorite, and the title track, NMHTP. The vocals on Saved by love tells you that this band has grown up, and they mean business. Song after song of melodic bliss, and sonic pleasure. The second video in the deluxe package is Sympathy, and is just plain fun to watch. The most important thing to remember is that this is a Christian band and every track has a great message, and that is the whole point. This CD is impressive and will not let you done. It has great vocals, strong riffs, a heavy groove throughout, and, hey, it could save your life :)
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|It was different and I liked the suspense.  The story took a surprising turn with both the mystery and the romance.  I plan to read the rest of the series.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic book. A different character narrates every chapter, and their voices were so genuine. It made me laugh and cry. Five stars for sure!
B000TU16GS|1.0|Needs more spices In the book .However it was nice and interesting but lacked humour.I hope the next book is better
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|Very well done. Really feels like I'm back in the 70's. Creepy house by a creepy lake with an old tree that you know has a history. Not to mention that the Warren's story is interesting in general.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|What a magical true story!<br /><br />Rodriguez didn't make it as a musician (like so many tens of thousands of others), or so he thought. But his music was bootlegged in South Africa, and he became a legend there, as famous as any rock star, all unbeknownst to him.<br /><br />Everyone in SA thought he had died long ago, and one of his fans decided to do some detective work to try to find out the true story of his death.  What a surprise when Rodriguez was found to be still alive.<br /><br />Of course he had do a concert tour down there; how moving to see Rodriguez on stage before thousands of cheering fans who were as enthusiastic as people would be to discover that Hendrix was still alive and giving a performance.  Indeed, many of the throng didn't really quite believe he really was still among the living, until the moment he stepped on stage.<br /><br />If it were fiction, nobody would find it plausible.<br />Truly, this is a must-see film!
B004LWZW2E|4.0|One of those movie that keeps you on the edge. Ok story line but the creepiness is what keeps you in.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I know I should focus on the fact that this movie is a beautiful redemption tale but, OMG, I CANNOT get the picture of DW's character dressed in his pilot's uniform, wearing those shades, and strutting down the hall to Joe Cocker's \\"Feelin' Alright\\" out of my head.  I don't want to!  What complete visual and auditory bliss!
B004UPAIDK|5.0|Bruce Campbell is one of the greatest character actors ever! He brought Ash to life in a way no one else could!
B008Y7J91M|5.0|I don't usually like Jane Austen novels (I'm a male); but this was a really good story. I thought the movie was very well acted. Very entertaining.
1451695195|5.0|Very powerful book and I bought several to give away to family and friends.  Eben Alexander writes a compelling account of his time in heaven during a serious illness.
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|Great movie but the quality is not that good.  It's a little grainy looking.  Sound is okay.  It's sad that Disney didn't include the original movie art poster on the DVD.  That's the one I really wanted but it was waay more expensive.  If you liked this movie as a kid like I did, it's worth getting to add to your collection.  Beware the Wheelers!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works nicely with great graphics. No complaints. There is not a whole lot more that can be said about solitaire. It is what it is and works very well!!!
B00004YTIQ|5.0|This pool cover fit our rectangle &#34;family&#34; sized pool perfectly. It held up through an entire AZ summer and monsoon season! It was an opaque blueish color.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|did not like the movie. disappointed and wish I didn't rent the movie. I am glad I didn't buy it though
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I've always wanted to learn Italian but have never had the time. This App is fun and helps you learn quickly in little bites so it's easy to find the time. And it's free, which is always awesome!:)
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like the combination of different games.  it reminds me of gardens which is only available on Apple products so I couldn't play that anymore. I think this one is much better.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to the end.  The author a had such an amazing way of separately introducing each character's lives and then slowly begin intersecting them.  Highly recommend!
B0041D843M|5.0|Very informative.  A life changing book on diet. The wealth of unbiased dietary information is priceless. A must read for anyone interested in improving their health through diet and excercise.
B000YHG72E|5.0|My kids, ages 7 and 9 think this is the greatest movie ever! My husband and I laughed out loud. It's a fun family film.
B00G32OER4|3.0|Not a bad flick, The ending is a bit abrupt and the Doll thing doesn't really fit but its a true story....NOT
B00G32PQNA|3.0|Too long. Some scenes and dialogues go on for ever. At least 30 minutes can be taken out and not be missed.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|G.. do they have to kill off all the likable characters. disappointing, I'd like to see something that makes me feel good, not sad and hopeless.
140006922X|5.0|This is a thoughtful, scholarly approach to an important aspect of history. If you don't like to question your beliefs, and you believe that the Bible is truth, you won't like this book. If you think the historical and cultural context of a person's life is an important part of understanding the person and his/her actions, you will enjoy this book.
1594489505|5.0|I have only a few words for this series of great books!! Wonderful, spellbinding books of a world I hope never to  live in. A depressing world indeed.  Worth reading, among the best books ever.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Fantastic album, only song that was not good monster. If there were any doubts about eminem being one of the legends of rap, this album silences them
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|The best work ever from Stryper. This album kicks butt from start to finish! Stryper finally delivers what I have been waiting for since To Hell With The Devil.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was good but it had a sad ending I understand it's a sad book but it also did get quite boring personally I thought it would be a great series if you wrote another book if you do write another I would be thrilled because they are some pretty awesome books.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is the best series.  I was getting it at the Library too catch up but didn't want to wait.  I have pre ordered Season 3, can't wait till Feb 2014!
B007Y36K46|5.0|It's a new personal favorite and I like it more and more each time I watch it.  It's best watched with fellow fans that can appreciate this living adaptation of the book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A journey through life from the mind of a messed up teenager. Charlie sees everyone's pain and feels it himself. He wishes for friends and for love.<br />nctennisnut@yahoo
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|Man oh, man, what a fantastic movie. Just think of it as Die Hard in the White House. John Cale was denied his dream job, to be in the secret service. He goes on an special White House tour with his daughter and other guests. Then...you guessed it, some people want to over take the White House, and kidnap the president. Little do the bad guys know, Cale has special talents and surprises waiting for the bad guy.  I won't say who they are, or what they want because that will just ruin a lot of plot twits, and trust me, there's a lot of them. It's up to Cale to save the president and the day.<br /><br />There is so much working for this movie. First off, the characters. There isn't a single one that annoyed me. All of them severed their purpose.  You even like to hate the bad guys. The characterization was such a nice touch. It made the movie enjoyable.  This movie is also very funny. I actually laughed out loud in several parts, and I rarely do that.  You want action? Fine, then this movie is for you.  Like I said, think of this as Die Hard in the White House.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with White House Down.  If you put this on, everyone will enjoy it. Get it now, and thank me later.  Now excuse me, I want to see this again.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|About a month ago I heard the first single and saw the video of \\"No More Hell to Pay\\" by Stryper on YouTube. Wow! I couldn't believe how good it was! I had to watch the video for a second time to make sure I wasn't delusional, but after watching it again, I liked it even more than the first time. I listened to this song over and over again on a daily basis while salivating for more new songs from Stryper! This last weekend the No More Hell to Pay CD/DVD was finally delivered to my mailbox. What a life changing and fantastic day! EVERY SONG is just as good as the single I'd been listening to over and over. There is not one song on the album that I ever feel like skipping over (even the ballad entitled \\"The One\\" is so catchy)! I haven't been this excited for an album to be released since Jesus Freak by D.C. Talk came out in the mid 90s. Stryper, and the album, No More Hell to Pay, have not only met my expectations, but surpassed them by leaps and bounds! No More Hell to Pay has instantly become my FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!<br /><br />Killer guitar solos/duels between Michael Sweet and Oz Fox will melt your face off, and the Rhythm section of Robert Sweet and Tim Gaines is so tight and tasteful (I'm really enjoying Tim's bass lines on this album)! I can't believe how awesome Michael Sweet's vocals are! His vocals seem to be like fine wine as they get better with age! I was in middle school when my dad purchased the \\"Soldiers Under Command\\" record for me, and I have loved 80's metal ever since. What I love about No More Hell to Pay, is that it is \\"modern 80's metal!\\" It's definitely not the glam metal of the 80s; however, I'm often reminded of Motley Crue, Guns n Roses, ACDC, etc. when listening, but it is with a mature and modern sound that makes this entire album not just an original, but a masterpiece! Did I mention that No More Hell to Pay has become my FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME?!?
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|My fave BOC so far, after listening to it for several months. This one feels more like a concept album than a collection of tracks, compared to their album Children... Has a dreamy, moody vibe to it that reminds me of a soundtrack to a late 70's/80's thriller, John Carpenter movies, that sort of thing. A soundtrack to a non-existant post-apoc themed movie. Very warm, analog sound. It's my choice of late night listening alongside my Tangerine Dream albums.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Awesome show! Can't wait to catch up. Great cast and awesome content. Like the fact how the show is made pretty close to the real thing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|all my friends have been playing this game asking me why I wasn't.  now I am happy to say I can. I really like it and quickly became addicted.
B004WR125O|5.0|I took a chance on this when I ordered my new Onkyo receiver because the price was too good to pass up.  Add in the excellent price I paid for the receiver and you get a good deal all around.  I love my new receiver and everything I hoped the wireless adapter would be, it was.  I now have more streaming capability than I ever had before.  I recommend this adapter as a companion piece to the new Onkyo TX-NR616.  Both perform flawlessly.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is my most favorite alarm app!!  I use it every week day.  Love the fade-in volume. Wish I could find this for my Ipad as well!!!!!!!<br />The only thing I would change is that the dismiss button was not as wide as the snooze.  I have mistakenly turned it off several times.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This is a very good hidden object game, but I do have a minor issue with it. It has a LOT of dialogue to go through between each level.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My sons love playing this on my laptop or kindle.  They love anything Angry Birds.  I like how there are so many themes available for Seasons to Star Wars now.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It is very addictive. It does gradually get harder as you go. I wish I could get past level 33.
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|I don't know why the other reviews are negative;  this is a great way to backup your current apps, see what apps are on your sd card, find out how much space you have and how much space you're currently using.  I'd never have an Android without installing this app first thing.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Don't be fooled by my message but this is the best game ever! You get to create your own character and a guy named Steve follows you. The best game ever. Just like on Apple.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The game has a easy to follow tutorial that after only a few puzzles will leave you eager to get involved with the story and have you frantically hunting cunningly hidden<br />items. Highly recommended.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Of course, the best sci-fi, especially the last three episodes in the series (the first three made, without Jarjar Binks.  A blast from the past.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5's first hits!  It's so sultry and passionate...I just love listening to it.  It's full of jazz influence, and I love Adam's voice.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I'm not one to write reviews very often, but I had to for NMHTP.  I was not a Stryper fan when they first came on the scene, however as I have grown older and wiser I have really come to like and respect Stryper.  No More Hell To Pay is one of the best and most listenable metal albums I've heard in a very long time.  I've been listening to it over and over and I have not grown tired of it.  It's great to listen to excellent metal music that doesn't have negative lyrics.  If you are a fan of metal you will love this album, whether you're a Christian or not!
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love the way crops don't wither.  Plus the fact that you can do things with your harvested items makes this a better game than Farm Story.  My only issue, since I don't do Facebook is the difficulty of getting new neighbors.  The community play in Farm Story is a lot easier and is easier to converse with people in game.
B003L77G6A|4.0|I always love seeing the BBT guys in costume, and this season brings us one of the best episodes in that vein, &#34;The Justice League Recombination.&#34; An upcoming Halloween party at the comic book store makes for hilarious hijinks when the guys try to get Penny in on the act -- as Wonder Woman!<br /><br />As I look back it seems a mediocre season, but I always love the interaction even when the episodes aren't great. It still makes me laugh.
0802473156|5.0|Really enjoyed this book as it gave me insight to myself and also to my potential partner.  I was married for 23 years and unfortunately it ended. I learned that my language was &#34;physical touch&#34; and my ex was very cold as far as giving affection so now I understand why I was so unhappy in the marriage.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|One of the greatest episodes on this set is &#34;The Staircase Implementation,&#34; which takes us back in time to see how the four guys' relationship got started. It also tells us why the elevator doesn't work. Another great episode in this season is &#34;The Precious Fragmentation,&#34; in which the discovery of a prop ring from Lord of the Rings puts a great strain on the guys' relationship.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I love this show, have watched a few episodes and I love John Cleese. A must buy for any Cleese fan.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|It helped me understand how it is possible to have such atrocities occur there and how long it will be before changes can occur.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|I have become a big fan of Jonathan and Charlotte. The first time I saw them, I watched them on a video clip and was interested in hearing more of their music. They both have beautiful voices and I enjoy listening to them sing in any language (even though I only understand English). :) Though they both have beautiful voices, Jonathan has a voice that is so amazing, it is almost unbelievable. I could listen to him sing all day. Jonathan's voice literally makes me stop what I am doing and just listen. I have their \\"Together\\" CD and enjoyed it so much, I pre-ordered the \\"Perhaps Love\\" CD. I would recommend this to any music fan.
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|I'm not taking anything away from Black Radio 1 but this one, to me, was better than the first one. Respect
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Love reading Grisham. It's just the last two have been kind of predictable. It's a short easy read...give it a try.
B00FZ4LOH4|1.0|You know its all over for Eminem when he's wearing Cargo pants in a music video for a horrible single that's also promoting the latest Call of Duty game.<br /><br />Not one song in this album sounds clean or complete, like former notable, meaningful classics such as 'Stan', 'Cleaning out my closet' or 'White America'. This is in part because the beats sound like they were taken from youtube producers (Dr Dre had no hand in the production)and also because he has this whole 'look at me, im so fast and lyrical' style going on which not only doesn't work well with the beats but is totally unlike the classic slim shady, who was mellow and captivating with his rhymes.<br /><br />The song 'bad guy' is basically some joke of a sequel to his classic song 'Stan' even though it shares no resemblance in quality. The beat sounds like it sampled some old Nintendo game and the continued narrative is cheap.<br /><br />The entire album basically seems like an attempt at a final cash in on the angst filled suburban teenagers, which is why he raps about being bullied, feeling alienated and wishing people would 'drop dead', the sort of stuff that will hit their sweet spot.<br /><br />Even those who listened to his first three albums during our younger days will find the subject matter nauseating as we have all grown up now, including Eminem himself. He needs to call it a day. Overall this album is terrible.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  It has action, adventure and everything else that makes an awesome SciFi show.  I would recommend this to all of my friends.
B0041CGP02|5.0|Great band and lots of their hits are on this set.  Been around a long time.  Their staying power is impressive.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Fantastic action.  Loved the Hulk lines and action.  Cannot wait until the sequel and what they come up with next
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is just a great show.  I only just discovered it on Netflix when it was added this week. I watched on the episodes at work during lunch which i downloaded from Amazon.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I have waited may years for Stryper to make another album. Well.....it was worth the wait!!!!!!!!!!! This album is by far the best of their music yet. Hard guitar riffs, heavy beat...and Michael Sweet's vocals are second to none. NOW we just need you guys to tour!!!!!!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Great little game to kill time or just zone out for few minutes. Easy enough for<br /> my youngest to play but not mind numbing for me
B0096HK4WW|4.0|Not bad show, a little crazy and the special effects a little dated, but overall a good show to watch when you have some down time.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|What an outstanding book!!  It should make any of us so thankful for the country we live in even with our many problems at this time.  I hope Malala can someday return to her country and help them find their way to peace and democracy and to help bring the education of girls to a reality!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very entertaining.  The play quality is a little slow but keeps me coming back. Glad it's on kindle now.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Having a lot of fun, hate waiting for new life but if I didn't have to wait I'd be playing it  all of the time.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|Cricket, the boy next door, may be my favorite YA male in recent memory.  Smart, friendly, creative, capable and selfless, he is so reliably good in all situations that he is irresistible.  Stephanie Perkins knows that a good love triangle needs two good options for Lola, age 17.  Lola tries to fit her rocker boyfriend, age 22, in to her life (she gets involved with him and lies about her age) but they only fit when they are alone together -- she is not comfortable with his roommate and he does not care for her friends.  For a year, she struggles to make things work.  When Cricket and his family move back in next door, her life gets complicated.  Loved this group of characters and their transitions from point A to B.  What a talented author.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Super boring and gets really hard.It's not worth 0.99 cents and really sucks.worst app on my kindle. On youtube look up &quot;Illigal nerf gun mod&quot;. It is awesome and hilarius.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|As the 501st reviewer of this book, I will steer clear of plot points and keep this brief.  Anna and the French Kiss gives a unique look at a young woman's life at 17 in a boarding school for Americans in Paris.  Anna starts out at her new school feeling overwhelmed, friendless and unable to speak in French, and ends up graduating from the school comfortable walking alone in Paris, with a small group of friends, and able to understand a conversation in French that she overhears.  Life in the dorm, dining hall and classrooms is interesting and different from her public high school in Atlanta.  But teen friendships and relationships are universal the world over, and it is fun to watch them bloom and wither and struggle and flourish in a world cultural paradise.
B00992CF6W|3.0|At first it is really fun and it gets addicting but after a while it gets boring and you become a loser. So don't get it . It is not worth 6.99
B005LAIIN0|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE!!!<br />Zombies...Brad Pitt...Action...running...scenes that make you jump.<br />This is an action packed movie made realistic by the virus that spreads across the globe.<br />Buy and watch it now!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Took me a while to decide if I should own a Chromecast and I should have waited longer. The current bad news is limited compatible app availability and it should be much broader by now. Kind of takes the fun out of the device as not much to play around with. While this cannot be directly compared to a Roku box, the Roku is far more enjoyable, feature rich and easier to use, especially with their current smart phone/tablet apps.<br /><br />The good news is that the Chromecast quality is excellent and streams better than a basic full PC I have hooked up. Its really an amazing device.  There is a bright future ahead for this item. For the low price, I will not be retuning it as it just may catch my interest again when it becomes more established.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I use this Chess game on my Kindle when I'm out on trips and vacation or just sitting around with some to kill. A good game.
B008JFUNYG|3.0|*Contains Minor Spoilers *<br /><br />An exhausting, loud and pointless remake (or sequel) that may succeed in grossing you out, but that, along with some decent performances, and high production values, are not enough to outdo the original 1981 film which had style, wit and imagination. The story is basically the same as Raimi's original and \\"Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn\\", a group of people, staying in a very creepy looking cabin (I mean really? They couldn't find a far more attractive option than this crumbling, disgusting disaster-piece in the woods for a getaway?) where they plan to help their troubled, vulnerable friend Mia (Jane Levy), overcome her very bad drug addiction and hopefully to mend her relationship with her estranged, stiff, boring brother, David (Shiloh Fernandez). Again, bad location choice. If I wanted to help someone in their addiction and want to cheer them up, this sinister, decayed, stench-infested, crumbling, nasty cabin in the middle of nowhere is the last place I would take them to. Rant over, moving on. They soon discover a funky stain on the floor boards which looks like dried blood (hint-  to get the heck out of there) that leads them to the basement where hundreds of rotting animal carcasses hang from the ceiling (another hint-  to get the heck out of there) and a mysterious book covered in a black plastic bag and wrapped in barbed wires (another hint-  to get the heck out of there and to not open this freakin' book) is found. The group nerd, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), despite various warnings scribbled within the pages of the book, like \\"LEAVE THIS BOOK ALONE\\", foolishly recites some of the incoherent words written within out loud, in doing so, awakens a monstrous, blood-thirsty demon that soon wreaks havoc amongst them.<br /><br />There are many things that frustrate me about this film. Yes, it had a fairly decent budget, $17 million, unlike the original movie which was made using loose change, so the production values, the special effects, the make-up effects, cinematography are all up to standard, maybe above average for the genre. Yes, it does move along at a very brisk pace and the overall tone, is dark, very dark, perhaps too dark. \\"Evil Dead\\" (2013) makes its point abundantly clear within the first 30 minutes - it is a dark tale of horror with no room for humor, or wit, or substance. If you want some laughs or enduring characters, go look somewhere else. Now, normally, I would not have a problem with this as sometimes I like my horror movies to be served cold and dark, but in this case, this is supposed to be a remake (or sequel, still confused as to what this is really) of \\"Evil Dead\\" and that film had plenty of quirky humor and characters and despite being a very low budget production, excelled in being witty, creative (some of the make-up effects were good, although not all since some of the actors wore some crazy wigs that looked incredibly cheesy) and had stylish direction. Yes, when viewed today, it is very, very dated and it suffers from its very low budget and primitive effects work. For instance, the clay-mation effects were not very successful. Yes, the character Ash (Bruce Campbell) was not as memorable in the first film (although nowhere near as forgettable as the characters in this film, more on this later) as he was in the 1987 sequel, which was really a remake with a better budget, where he gave an incredible physical performance and is the highlight of \\"Dead by Dawn\\". But both films had more to offer than the bloodshed. Both movies threw buckets of blood and ooze all over the place, the walls, the floors, the actor's faces etc and there was dismemberment galore but kept it tongue and cheek. That combined with the stylish direction and overall outrageousness kept you repulsed and amused at the same time.<br /><br />This remake (or sequel), goes straight for the jugular and does not have a funny bone in its body. The characters are also lack-luster despite the overtly dramatic back story two of the characters are given. They are throwaway, unmemorable, bland characters. Despite some generally good performances, Levy is especially good, it is not enough, you end up rooting for no-one, and in the end, you are just left looking at boring people doing incredibly stupid things in a very clich&eacute;d horror film. The dialogue is also a bit forced. It is pretty much established within the first 10 minutes who each individual is thanks to this in your face, forced dialogue, the recovering addict- check, the estranged brother and friend- check, the girlfriend- check, the nurse and concerned friend - check, the geek- check. Which brings us to the star attraction, if it isn't the actors, the location, the direction, I guess you can state that the star of this freak show is the repulsive gore and the never-ending violence. It is excessive and admittedly, it doesn't give you a chance to catch your breath. There are far too many scenes of self mutilation and gore to the point that this film ends up being nothing more than torture porn. For those that love this stuff, you should not be disappointed but despite being a horror film fan, I have been one for the last 3 decades, I have come to the point where I do expect more from certain horror films. Considering the original film and the original sequel (and remake) offered more than just the gore, I was expecting the same of this remake. Was this too much to ask for? Despite a different set of characters and upgraded special effects, there is nothing new here, this has already been done twice before in the series and it was done better and without the humor, it falls a bit flat. You will just sit there waiting for the next gory set-piece and nothing more. There is no originality, no sense of humor, no memorable characters, no creative camera tricks and angles. It is glossier but uninspired. Aside from plenty of gore, there is not much here to recommend it, again, unless you just love torture porn, then this is right up your alley.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Evil Dead\\" (2013) is pretty solid from a technical standpoint but that does not mean it is a great film. The makers of this entry did not have the budget restraints and obstacles of the original, boasting high production values and this shows in the final production. It delivers in being outlandish and gory but it is a disappointment since gory does not always equal scary and I was expecting much more from this. Apparently there will be a sequel and I can already see the premise. Let me see, another group of people in the same old creepy cabin in the same old creepy woods, who find the same old creepy book, and some-one foolishly recites the same old creepy incantations, resurrecting the same old creepy forces, some people will get possessed and much violence and gore will ensue. The End.<br /><br />I hope they prove me wrong.<br /><br />2.5 out of 5ack story two of the characters are given. They are throwaway, unmemorable, bland characters.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was great! OMG I loved it! Is tarted reading it sometime last week and just finished it today! I loved this book. I have not read a book I loved this much since I read my first Christine Feehan book. I honestly could not put this book down. It was sexy in a good way even the raunchy parts and made me laugh a few times! All and all I thoroughly LOVED this book and can't wait to read the others! I really hope Christian ends up saying that he loves her!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|wow..... just when I thought I knew how the tale would end, there was another twist.<br />I love a book that keeps me guessing.  This one did.  Great read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It's a good story,but some of the story lines stretch credibility,particularly all of the moving around of the gold and the drunken flight to the islands. It is all in fun, of course, as the real goal is to make the feds look silly. He succeeds in that.
B000IHY146|5.0|Karen Dalton's voice seems to have a strong affect on it's listener weather like me you love it or hate it one thing is for sure Karen will make you feel something. There is little knowing about her private life, in fact she only recorded two albums this been her second. For me there are three real stand outs &#34;Something On Your Mind&#34; &#34;Katie Cruel&#34; and &#34;Same Old Man&#34; I've a strong dislike for her version of &#34;When A Man Loves A Woman&#34; I'm surprised it even made it's way on to this record. Overall I really enjoyed this c.d. it's well worth checking out. What I feel so very sad about is how the song &#34;Katie Cruel&#34; could have been worth about her life. She truly was a jewel
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway suffers is a fun game and if you are reading this review I recommend playing this game! It's awesome!

B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Beautiful graphics and music. Once I start I don't want to stop. It's not easy, but very satisfying when you figure it out.
B008JFUNJQ|5.0|I didnt read the book. All i know is that the movie was riveting. Well done. I will definitely read the book now. If all these people are complaining, saying that the movie is not as good as the book, then the book must be outstanding! Not too many movies i would go back to the theater to see a second time, but i would easily with this one because it was nonstop awesomness.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think this app is mostly recommended for YOU!!! It is very good why else would i give it 5 stars!!!!
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Not any good suprises here.  The story was a compilation of a few other movies; The Happening, 28 Hours Later...  I have no idea how this one cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Waste of money.
B003IY48PS|5.0|Classic, I loved the movie since I was child, One of the few movies that made me jump. I recommend to watch.
B00FPH6M82|2.0|Horrid acting on both Smith's parts.  It's like they were reading the script as uninterested robots.  A good premise that went nowhere.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|Classic, I loved the movie since I was child, One of the few movies that made me jump. I recommend to watch.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|1st season kept pretty close to the books (loved the books).  The actors do a great job at playing the characters while adding their own feel.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is is so good my apps are working faster and my battery last x2 longer then before I would recommend this app to people who have slow data.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I don't want to buy any lives. Ever. Or any part of any game. That is lame. Fun game though!
B00DMKFN34|4.0|Planes is an animated comedy similar to Cars. It's not quite as good but young children who enjoy family friendly G-rated movies will get a kick out of it.

B00B5C0YOO|2.0|just an app manager that lets you make backups of your current apps. would be more useful if you could access files on your phone.<br /><br />the default android app manager does basically the same thing sans the app backup.<br /><br />if you rooted your device and run a custom rom, this app is useless to you. just stick with whatever your rom has preinstalled.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Great flick watched it on my iPhone. It will probably be better on s bigger screen. I'm going up watch it again.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The sound is great and I'm using it plugged into my guittar amp, video game and home theater receiver... Certainly a great deal for the price I've paid. The only warning I could give is that you'll become much more exigent and regular ear phones you might already have will sound like trash :-)
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Clint Eastwood shows his skill as both a director and actor. Excellent insights on both baseball selections and issues with aging.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun to pass the time on boring tv shows....good on trips, vacations in motel rooms, etc.  just a whole lot of fun.  The game get harder and harder as you play longer...interesting.
B0071LEJSA|5.0|Its like the Revolution never ended!. Anyway, by far the best album cover ever. Jerry on pedal steel.<br />&#34;You call it rain<br />But the human name<br />Doesn't mean s*** to a tree&#34;
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Wow this book was so fun to read. Male POV was so great you'd think Emma Chase is actually a man. So many moments that you literally do laugh out loud. Definitely will recommend this book to my friends.
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|Really bad.  That's all.  I love action and Sci-Fi...I couldn't even sit through the entire movie.  I stopped it twice to try and come back to it, but just couldn't and gave up.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The alarm is easy to set and the best part is that you can dim the screen with a pinch of the finger. I can reach over in the middle of the night and brighten it to see the time and fine it with the same simple pinch action.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Loved Mamma Mia when I saw it on Broadway.  It's a great movie to watch at home with friends and family.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm always looking for some sort of game I can just pick up and put down as time allows, whether it be an hr or only a few mins. This game is great for that.
B00FHEP9XM|5.0|Love this app !! It's so handy and works great. It makes typing so much faster and it's so easy to use. It's nice that it's also customisable.  :-)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its a good interactive puzzle game that keeps you going. My 5 year old daughter loves playing and she even helps me with it sometimes.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|The word that comes to mind after watching this movie is &#34;WOW&#34; The storyline and the writing was fantastic! This is a movie that you can watch over and over again and not get bored with it.<br />I can not praise this movie enough so I give it 5 out of 5 stars!
B00DSY8D36|5.0|Even though I have dyslexia, and reading is not something I look forward to I do read quite a bit because I want to learn everything I can. When I learned that some Kindle's could read text aloud I was excited. I recently got a Kindle Fire HD 7”. I didn't realize though that it didn't read .pdf documents aloud. Luckily, the PDFmax app does. It not only reads aloud, it scrolls as it reads. You can highlight text. You can draw on the document. I'm sure there are many other cool things you can do with this app, but I haven't played around with it enough to do much yet.
B0068AWQQ2|3.0|I have seen the original Fright Night movie back in the 80's when it first came out and I pretty much know the original word for word and when I watched the remake I have to say I was very disappointed, but then I watched it as if it was a new movie and stopped comparing it to the original movie and I have come to a new view on this movie. The new story line is very imaginative and the acting was good but I have a problem with the Vampire fangs, they did not have Vampire fangs but instead they had a mouthful of out of place, crooked and way to many pointy teeth in their mouth, I'm sorry but that is not a Vampire, that is some kind of freaky monster thing.<br />I gave this 3 of 5 stars mainly for the fresh take on a classic movie.
B001I9B9I4|5.0|It's a very wholesome movie.  Something I can watch with the grand kids.  Katie Holmes is the best in this movie.  Samantha and James are modern day star crossed lovers.  So sweet!!
B00AGYM0DU|5.0|Being and Time. Dogen in story across thousands of years. Read it slowly and appreciate each moment. A tale that might let you be in time.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|Not for me.  This is strictly for teenage girls.  Not for those in the mid-life. Girls just want to have fun.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|The game is fun and has a great variety of jewels to keep it from seeming repetitive but it is not boring.  Great in keeping your mind active and clear. I highly recommend this game.  I play it on my Kindle Fire so everything is easy to read and see. Great for senior citizens!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What can I say?  It is totally addicting.  Hard to put down.  Don't do it.  You will get addicted.  I promise.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is supposed to be the same cable that was sent with the Kindle Fire HD, but I think it's a tad shorter.  It's also stiffer.  BUT this cable seems to work even better.  I don't know how that's possible, but it is.  I have the rapid charger, but find I don't really need it with this cable.  The only objection I have in getting this was the cost of shipping which was nearly the cost of the item, but I give five stars for the actual working of the cable.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Put this on my Kindle as a new game.  Haven't had a chance to place very much.  Love Mahjong, though.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Tried this app out for free and got what I paid for. It didn't help my Facebook browsing.  I would just open up Facebook in a browser and enjoy Facebook more.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game.  Haven't played much.  Clear, concise, and easy to play.  Wish more games downloaded and installed this easy.  Nice.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a very good book. However, I felt that it was a bit rushed. Everything that was going go happened, happened all at the very end. It was a good book, but not as good as the first. Kind of felt like it was just there to make this into a trilogy. Was it really necessary, or could we have went on to book 3?
B00FMFEA68|1.0|Will you stop your spiteful mithering for goodness sake This is as far from a classic as Kill Uncle was. Full of character assassinations, unwitty asides, bloated lilac prose and a general hatred for humanity. One of the worst books I have ever read. This queen should most certainly be dead.
B002LB13SE|5.0|chilling, keeps you watching and wondering. Never expected some of it, leaves you really thinking...&#34;what would you do&#34;? Good movie
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Great sci fi comedy. A lot of funny folks in the cast make the movie extremely laughable.  Rent this and enjoy
B003O86FMW|5.0|Quick and exciting to read.  Elicits many emotions and the urge to being book 3 immediately after finishing.  Highly recommended!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game doesn't download the game by King.com at all. I have this on my cellphone and this game isn't the same one. I'm disappointed!
B000KIPT30|4.0|I like this headphone amp a lot, I use it at my drum set for local control of my headphone volume.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Small and compact<br />- Decent sound quality<br />- Decently durable<br /><br />Cons:<br />- AC adaptor and power cord are a bit flimsy. It doesn't get a very good connection
B0001US8FI|5.0|I wanted THIS DVD not only for the Great ENTER THE DRAGON movie, but for \\"BRUCE LEE: A WARRIOR'S JOURNEY\\",that has THE GAME OF DEATH, the last movie that Bruce Lee was working on before he passed. It shows the way HE INTENDED IT, not that TRAVESTY that was put out with PAPER CUT-OUTS and STAND-INS!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Still learning to use it.  I can make separate lists for each store where I shop.  Fairly easy to use.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so fun.When ever I am bored I play this game.It is such a good game.Sometimes when  people come around I play this game and then they ask me what game it is because they get hooked.I knew this game by my cousin because I got hooked.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this book was well written and an unusual format.  It did hold my interest,  at first I was disappointed at the ending, however thinking more about it  I have come to the conclusion it was a very clever, realistic , and perfect ending.  This is a very entertaining book,  soon to be a movie!
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|She has such a way with words, creating new concepts with characters' names, products, associations and more, that are THAT close to now that you begin to believe you will wake up the next morning in that world. It is excellent for discussion and most thought-provoking with regard to ethics, morality, and the nature of humanity. It would be worthwhile to read all three books in proper sequence at once, to get the totality of her genius.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Very good first book was much better I will read them again.  Dragging the dragon queen out way too long
B001NOOKH6|5.0|American classic for sure.  Amazing story about an amazing woman.  Love it!  Great gift for the female in your life
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I've always loved this show and to get the whole series for just under $53 is a dream come true. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that three of the Mrs. Columbo shows are included as bonuses, of course they don't have near the high standard of Columbo but I still like them. There is no booklet listing the episodes but I took the idea of another customer and simply turned the labels so that the list of shows are facing the outside, which also includes a brief description of each show.<br /><br />List of Mrs. Columbo shows:<br /><br />Murder Is a Parlor Game<br />A retired Scotland Yard homicide inspector and author of a best seller on perfect murders is forced to kill in self-defense.<br /><br />A Riddle for Puppets<br />A ventriloquist finds his dummy is acting independently of his will and kills the man who carved it. It's up to Kate Columbo to solve the murder.<br /><br />Caviar with Everything<br />A society caterer, angry that her husband is divorcing her for her business partner, has murder in mind for both.<br /><br />I noticed some people have reported bad disc, I just received my Columbo today and have only played two disc and it may be some time to find a defective one if one exists, if I happen to come across that problem I will post an update.<br /><br />To summarize: This is a wonderful collection and the shows look great, to me watching Columbo is like having an old friend come to visit. love it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Well it is a good game. Not my usual type though. I am just using this cause my wife seems to excel at this game. However I am stuck at level 7 for now.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Delving into truth, and having it read like fiction is a talent that this author has, and imparts to his audience.  It is short and brilliant.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Well done about a super firm. Bezos could not be such a winner without his out get it done at any price. I'm not sure this was always what he needed but it worked.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|It didn't really keep my attention. The story line was good, but it just didn't have the stellar the quality that I was expecting. John Goodman's character was simply overwrought; it seemed at times he was trying to hard. I was most impressed with the work of Don Cheadle and enjoyed the character he played better than any other
B005NFVZTM|5.0|One of the best of the Marvel movies: great characterizations, engaging story and it fits well into the existing mythos
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was able to finally get this on my Kindle Fire.  I am so pleased.  The graphics are great and it is the Full Game.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|very easy to use search engine every thing in one place.. not sure what else to add but need the words to post
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Filled with ads, unless you upgrade ($) don't waste your Time. Deleted it pretty fast after I downloaded and tested it.
B00632HWOG|2.0|It is a great format and easy to use and access yahoo. The big downside is the app comes with what I consider a big flaw; there is no way to log out and I eventually had to delete the app to get it to close. I am uncomfortable leaving my email open all the time. If this is not a problem for you then the app is easy to use and has a nice format
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the price, this is an amazing product.  I use this for my bedroom TV to stream Netflix and my Google Play Music. The set up was beyond easy.  I will often hear people question the need for this device when a 360, PS3 or Apple TV all do the same things and have more features.  My answer is this: Price.  My main TV has a 360 but I'm not going to buy an additional console to simply get stream some movies from bed.  I love that I can use my phone or tablet to send content to it and not deplete my device's battery.<br /><br />The biggest con I have for this device is the lack of compatible apps. It's still a newer device and new content will be added.
B003477DVK|4.0|Very sweet movie.  Great for children.  Good acting by Frankie Muniz as well as the jack Russell terrier.  We need more<br />family oriented movies with out violence.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have been meaning to read this book for quite some time. Seeing that the movie was about to come out, I decided to try and read the book first if I could manage the time, but once is started, I could not put it down! There was a lot more to this book than I was expecting when I started it.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|This is a really functional app with a great interface. I was using Accuweather but found it to be a bit 'overcrowded' and switched to the paid add-free version of Weather Live. It's got all the information I need and a few different display options. I'm really happy with it, my only (small) complaint is that it does seem to take a while to update and there's no icon or indication of when it's updating.
B00DCX08MW|4.0|This is the best flying game I have to date. All he other games lack the ease of control that you have demonstrated so far. I will make at least one more purchase.
031237674X|4.0|Wonderful stories of past lives, interwoven with explanations by the author. It seems that most of the stories are from children in India, but as many in that country believe in reincarnation, it stands to reason that there would be more attention paid to kids who talk of previous lives. It made me think back to stories my children told me; my middle son talked a great deal of riding a horse and being chased by painted men with bows and arrows, and that they killed him &#34;in a parking lot&#34;. He was only 3 at the time, and since then I have read of volcanic flats in Nevada that resemble blacktop parking lots and have wondered if that was what he meant. My daughter, at a very early age, refused to wear girl's clothes, insisting she was a boy named John Henry. Again, at the time I thought it was just a vivid imagination.<br /><br />After reading this book, I tend to believe that there are too many instances from cultures around the world that speak of many lives we may have lived before, or may yet live. There is just so much evidence.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|I actually loved this movie. I was a little scared that I wouldn't like because I just brought having never seen it but it did not disappoint. If you like a love story then you wont go wrong with this one. The cast was well put together and I love Vanessa. So buy this movie and enjoy
B003UESJH4|4.0|Good historical account of an important person in an important  time period. Like the history stuff.  Excellent cast. Movie arrived in good shape and within expected time frame.
B004NS7120|5.0|Non stop drama and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.  From the first moment to the end it was very enjoyable watching.  Touching and a good buddy movie as well.  Great characters and good humor.  I especially liked the &#34;stick it to corporate america&#34; theme as well.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|My wife would kill me if I didn't.  Rate the Movie 5 Stars.. It surprisingly shows 3 stars on my Cable Provider Rating.. That's very low in my opinion.  Amazon delivered just as expected.  In top 5 of family favorites.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|this is the best game that in vols hunting it is enjoinal you don't even need wi ri it is nice and fun but it sick because you cant just play for free you have energy
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Everything works good. Just haven't figured out how to print to my network printer. I've done it with other apps.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great CD, possibly better than their first and that's saying a lot.  Can listen on repeat for hours, especially when studying
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|fantastic, can't wait for more 3rd party apps to come out.  Right now it's pandora, youtube, hulu plus, and netflix.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a wonderful book, for both children and adults.  It is a allegorical book about a child who is a brat but she becomes better towards the end.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|Like Iron man and Spiderman Thor is the best game ever. Good graphics  and awesome game complex into Thor. What game. Gameloft makes the good games like Asphalt 8, iron man, Spiderman,Minion rush and more.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This is one of the best albums from the legendary VAN HALEN.....While i think their debut is one of the BEST HEAVY ROCK albums ever, FAIR WARNING is AMAZING too!!!!! In fact, ALL the VAN HALEN albums with Dave Roth´s vocals are amazing!!!!!WELL DONE, VAN HALEN!!!!!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The book was very good, some of the plot hewed to close to original book, (see young paralegal ), but as with all Grisham, good read
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|GREAT ALBUM.....SLASH bring some amazing guests to bring vocals here, like Chris Cornell, OZZY, Ian Astbury and Myles Kennedy....Besides 2 or 3 tracks, i can say i really enjoy SLASH´s debut.....
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved it. Really well written. Easy to understand, not too much of nature description, but action. Now I cant wait to see all movies to it.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|BURN is simply one of the BEST HEAVY ROCK albums EVER!!!!! Yes, i love most ALL the stuff from DEEP PURPLE, and this one is one of their best!!!!The title track is AMAZING, ALL the songs ROCKS....GREAT GREAT ALBUM!!!!!!!COMPLETELY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!
B00CE3IC74|5.0|After learning of the magic that I can accomplish with simple NFC tags, I perused the Interwebs looking for ideal ones that looked good, worked perfectly, and were low in cost. These fit the bill perfectly. They're thick and have some real strength to them, rather than being paper-thin. I find that these work perfectly for me. I have a tag set up by my door to switch to home mode, one by my bed to silence my phone, one by my desk to launch music players, and two in my wallet (a contact and a battery saver tag). If you have an NFC-capable phone, you will not be disappointed.
0385751532|5.0|Beautifully done--superbly crafted--understated illuminosity !!<br />Boyne has unmasked \\"civilized man\\", reduced life to its basest elements--the satanic evil and the godly-good--and shone a spotlight on the fact that the godly-good most often flows from the minds and bodies of the very young.<br /><br />It doesn't take a physicist or a mathematician to understand that the simplest things in life are the most beautiful, the most eloquent, the most noble, the most moving---so exemplified by the bonds of friendship between two individual children.<br /><br />I witnessed it time and again in Ethiopia where there live tens of thousands of young children made orphans by Aids, malaria and war. They band together in groups of half a dozen or so and live a Musketeers' life of \\"All for one, one for all.\\" sharing everything they have, both food and sorrow.<br /><br />One of the few redeeming features of man exists when he is a child--innocent--incapable of understanding the adult world--unable to comprehend evil deeds done--when curiosity, kindness, friendship and unadulterated love prevail. It is the artificially contrived barriers conceived in the adult imagination that unleashe the evil demons that plague todays societies.<br /><br />What a beautiful metaphor Boyne has constructed to portray the barriers that seperate us both in times of peace and times of war--a barbed wire fence!<br />There are many fences that divide us--religous, economic, racial, ethnic, political, age, sex, flags and borders--unnecesary adult fabricated barriers each.<br />All of us are on one side or the other of each of these fences and often for no apparent reason do we find ourselves on one side or the other but for kismet, fate, or luck of the draw. So it was with Bruno and Shmuel-one of which found himself in soiled stiped pajamas, the other on the side of the crisp, clean uniforms of the German army.<br /><br />Yet, as children, they were able to do what their adult counterparts were unable to do--to build a bridge over the barrier, the barb-wire fence--a bridge of friendship, love and understanding. Even so it was not enough to negate the brute, violent forces of the adult world they were doomed to suffer.<br /><br />The world of children gives us hope--the world of adults takes that hope away! Thats just the way it is.<br /><br />DH Koester--\\"And There I Was\\" [[ASIN:1478710160 And There I Was Volume VIII: A Backpacking Adventure in Ethiopia]]do--to build a bridge over the barrier, the barb-wire fence--a bridge of friendship, love and understanding.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Decent Grisham. I was in the hospital overnight for observation and wanted some light, easy reading. This didn't disappoint.  The main character is locked in a Federal prison for a crime he did not commit.  He could have received a lighter sentence if he confessed and fingered others but he didn't.  While there, he arranges to be released and have his sentenced overturned by solving a murder.  He enters the witness protection program so he can be safe after fingering the murderer.  He collects the reward money for helping to solve the crime. From here the story takes off.  The rest is a complicated tale woven with suspense and intrigue but it wasn't impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak.  It kept my interest though at times it dragged a tiny bit,  I read it in a three or four hours.  The main character was a little tough to like and for some reason that is a tough one for me.  If you're a Grisham fan you'll enjoy it. If not, probably not worth your time.
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|Nice to have Head back in the group! It feels like the proper 'sequel' of an album that should have came before Path To Totality and  Korn III.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|My husband plays the game and seems to enjoy it quite a bit.  It is adequately challenging for a 60 y/o man who only occasionally plays video games.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I was not expecting this album to be this good. I have loved most of eminem's work but this album is special. This dude is so talented it should be criminal. He murders every rapper out there when it comes to creative lyrics. Great use of samples on this album as well. Stand out songs for me (I love em all though) are Rap God and Brainless. Buy this now.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I don't care for the music, but the workout is great.  Love the different levels, I can use the lower impact when I'm pregnant and the higher impact after I've gotten back into regular exercise again.  Very versatile
B009NY43NY|3.0|Definitely a disappointment compared to the rest of the books in the series.  I was so excited to get this last book and I feel like the author just threw something together to be done with it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I saw quite a few of my students carrying this book around with them last year, and eventually I borrowed it from one of them. This is a beautifully written tragedy that is filled with humor, optimism, and young love. Though some reviewers might not think that the personalities and language of the teenaged characters are realistic, as a high school teacher, I can tell you that there are real kids out there who talk and act just like Hazel and Gus. There are so many kids who hide the pain of whatever it is they are going through with humor. There are kids out there who avoid contact and relationships to protect others and themselves. And while there might not be as many kids who can relate to being terminally ill, or surviving cancer, there are kids out there who know sadness, hopelessness, and suffering. This book is uplifting and teaches the reader to take the positive and good in every situation, to live life (however long or short it might be) and live each day to its fullest potential. This is a beautiful story to read at any age.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|To the Stryper band members I say, stop drilling, gentlemen, you've hit oil!! There's way too much heavy metal sonic bombast in this album to mention! Relentless, slamming lead guitar from both Oz Fox and Michael Sweet; heart-stopping drums from Robert Sweet; deep, growly bass from Timothy Gaines; and Michael Sweet's Holy Spirit-infused lead vocals with plenty of those world-famous &#34;screams&#34; (I think he hits HIGHER high notes today than he did in the 1980's).  Think of &#34;No More Hell To Pay&#34; as &#34;To Hell With The Devil&#34;---Styper's iconic, chart-topping album from 1986---infused with at least 20 Starbucks venti pumpkin spice lattes and a shot of Rockstar Energy Drink.  Stryper's amps are definitely turned up to 11 for 2013, so if you don't want to be mowed down, you'd better get out of their way! :-)
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|I picked this up in the stores the day it came out, I was a hardcore Gorillaz fan and was over excited about the new album.  But to be 100% honest, me and many others were slightly disappointed when we first listened to it.  This wasn't the same Gorillaz we were used to, it was different.  It has a lot more collaborations and almost a completely electronic feel as compared to Demon Days and their S/T.  Regardless, I listened to this album in my truck for months.  I listened to this album obsessively (probably listened to it more than any other album I've owned) despite not liking it much at first.  It just kept dragging me in to listen to it again.  Honestly it took years for me to completely appreciate and realize just how much I love this album.  It's god damn brilliant, and it'll never tire.  Without a doubt this album is a grower on you, which is not really Gorillaz style.  But plain and simple, this album is a masterpiece, on par with Demon Days.  If you have doubts, pick it up, you won't regret it.  Even if you're underwhelmed at first, I'll be damned if you're able to even remove it from your CD player.
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|I like it pretty much so far, but I still believe Recovery and Em's first 3 albums are much better. Does Eminem go &#34;hard&#34; in this album as a revisit to the Marshall Mathers LP? No, I don't believe he does, but it may be a good thing, because it shows he's matured. This is one thing in this album and only a couple songs seem to have a lot of &#34;fire&#34; in them to me. Overall, a good album and I think it'll grow on me much more to be 5 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing candy crush, except for when I run out of lives, and have to wait...that makes me very sad.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|plays great
B008G3N71W|4.0|This is a fantastic story of a young actress who learns about herself, what she wants and needs in life, and how to achieve it - all from a mysterious stranger who gave her his phone number! The story was well written, which is always appreciated! I really liked reading about her journey to womanhood and accepting who and what she is!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It's always good to enter worlds created by Stephen King. It's good to forget about daily obligations, errands and bills. His worlds might be not the safest places in the universe but they're full of magic and supernatural powers. Scarry fairy tales. To make us feel a little bit more alive.
0316322407|5.0|The story of Malala shows true courage and strength in the midst of some very harsh circumstances. Even after being shot by the Taliban, she is still speaking out for the girls in Pakistan and other countries to be able to get an education.  I also found the book to have a lot of information about the Swat Valley, where Malala lived, as well as the country of Pakistan overall, especially the political and historical aspects of the country.  Usually, the news has only part of the story.  The book fills in the gaps and makes real the daily lives of those living in the midst of terrorist attacks, lack of electricity and other services, and lack of employment for much of the population.  In spite of all the obstacles, the people face, many of those who have left the country out of fear for their lives, would go back if the country did not harbor the Taliban.  Reading about the many courageous Pakistanis who are standing up against the Taliban, my hope is that the country can some day again be safe for those who have stayed and those who have left.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I've been looking for the complete collection of the Indiana Jones films that feature Harrison Ford. Some of them are kinda &#34;B&#34; rated but worth having in my DVDs as part of a set and shows some of the projects that George Lucas has created.<br />What would we do to get kids interested in exploration and history without exciting, clean, fun stuff like these?
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Pretty Good movie.  Got a bit long at parts and was of course very unbelievable at some parts - but other scenes were really great and a lot of adventure.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|This is an intelligent presentation, compact & full of additional Harry Potter information in each DVD. I enjoy the British actors & love to hear them give their insights gained during production.<br />My reservation, or negative comment, is that the highlight on the commentary is almost impossible to see. The Headings need to be bright colors that contrast with the rest of the words on the page.
0763668966|5.0|Fun for the entire family. It is a great book for a rainy afternoon to flip pages an learn fun information about other cultures. Great pictures, beautifully made.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great ... Really enjoyed this book. Could make a sequel though. Exciting, cool, heartbreaking, boss, and everything that would compliment WONDER!!!
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|Great app, but I would say up to 2.5-3 years old. It is too simple for my 3.5 year old.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great game i play this so much of the time I am on my kindle. but the one problem is my friends have ipods si when they get the update I have to wait until I get the update to play with them it is always about five days longer mojang please fix this.
B008Y5T5ZE|3.0|Very good movie. I wish the ending where a little different. It was suspenseful and I enjoyed it. Normally I don't watch this type of movie but I would recommend this one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Never made it to Oregon alive in the old game(unless I played as the banker.I guess only the wealthy make it right?) and I always wished the was a game for when they got there. I mean then what? New place no house no family no idea where anything is. I love that Gameloft gave us this game. It's varied interesting graphics are cute and it really keeps my attention. Awesome in every way.Thanks Gameloft! Ha -pioneering in Oregon and I'm not a dang banker
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I plugged it into my computer and it worked with no problems whatsoever. Build quality is sturdy with a thick wire for its plug and I love the blue stripe that lights up when plugged in. Unfortunately, a few hours after I received it, there was a minor accident regarding a heavy object falling onto my computer and severely bending the USB hub's plug. Sent an email to Anker Customer Support and am very satisfied with how things turned out!
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Great biography, plus an intriguing look inside a unique and (now I understand why) somewhat controversial company. Bezos comes across as visionary, focused and passionate, if not someone you would want to sit next to on a plane (or perhaps work for). Brad Stone creates a compelling narrative and turns a business book into a page-turner. I read it on my kindle app, on my android phone, and the linkage between these fixtures in modern life I now understand better. Amazon has won. I say this because, after reading this book, I would love to take my business elsewhere, but I can’t imagine actually doing it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved loved loved this story!!! Be prepared to cry a lot. You won't want to put it down. I want a sequel.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I use this app almost daily to learn Spanish. I like the format used and the female's voice is pleasant and she articulates well.  I would like to see the translation of the reviewed words at the end of the exercises.  I would also appreciate more info like why I got an answer wrong -- it advised me that I used the bebo form of the word instead of the bebe form. Also would like a few rules or explanatory sentences included to highlight the learning curve especially with the subject pronoun words. Thank you for the android version!!!!!
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|CGI and other special effects were great. What could have been a really hokey movie, turned out to be a pretty fun ride. Cast was okay. Sort of a higher budget B movie. Still liked it however.
B000J159N8|5.0|This movie kept my interest and was really lifelike. What really surprised me is my husband never watches movies I watch he watched it with me and when I asked why he said he thought it was really good.

How heady is that? If we could only get The Wiki to travel back to 1939. Earlier would really cause history to become disjointed even beyond what most of might imagine..
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book! Orson Scott Card tells a magnificent story. Ender's Game is one of my all time favorites. This is a must read.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Don't like the whole concept of having to buy boosters to complete a level.  I feel sorry for people who get caught up in this.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|A great story line that held my Imagination all through the book, from the first page to the last. Can't wait to read the rest of them.
B00EVW013E|4.0|Good movie but sometimes got a little cheesy.  It has one F Bomb that I wish wasn't there besides that all good.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|It didn't work. 6AM came and went and no alarm. When I turned on the fire it alarmed, not good.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive.......just wish you were not forced to stop and you are put on time out<br />.but  great fun.  Need more games like this
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I couldn't fine the Fourth Season in any of the stores in my area.  It was so convenient to order it on-line and receive it through the mail.  I love this series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You need to get kind of like real minecraft except less blocks but still the best game ever and in survival it has mobs
B0083EM24C|4.0|I enjoyed this new album by Passion Pit, but compared to their previous effort, the remarkable &#34;Manners,&#34; this album didn't knock me out nearly as much. But that's forgiveable: the creativity and refreshing energy found in &#34;Manners&#34; was a hard thing to duplicate. So, while, I'm not nearly as crazy about this new CD, there are still plenty of catchy tunes and upbeat rhythms to make it a a very enjoyable listening experience. Songwriter Michael Angelakos shows once again that he has the talent and songwriting chops to transcend the confines of any specific genre. Looking forward to hearing more from him.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Amazing. It's Incredible like he never skipped a beat picked up were he left off better then ever five starts. I may bit it again
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|It is hard to believe these guys are 50+ years old now.  This album harkens back to the days growing up with them (Front Row center seat for their performance in Tulsa OK when I was in college at the Old Lady on Brady - smacked Robert's hand - woot!).  I fully expected to like some of the songs on this album but was quite amazed that this one is as good, if not even better than Soldiers, and To Hell with the Devil.  WOW!  I just saw them in concert in September, and was bummed that they did not play anything off the new album, but can see they were waiting for the blitz that is going on now.  All the songs on this album have powerful and memorable riffs (Marching into Battle is heavy).  Lot of dueling solos, and vocal harmonies as you would expect.  The One is a bit slower/melodic, but I love it too!  Michael's screaming perfect pitch vocals hit the roof at times...again, amazing!  If you are a long time Stryper fan, this is a MUST buy.  If you are a new fan, this is something to check out as you won't be disappointed.  Can't stop this rock from rolling on!
B00E9A656K|5.0|REALLY fun game! A lil challenging at times but there are many options and race's you can choose from and there is also a lil story mode and I love the :)<br />Customized options
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Great kids movie and fun for adults too! I didn't have any reservations about my girls watching it unlike some kids movies nowadays.
B005NAE04E|2.0|After reading Ocean at the end of the lane and being enthralled by it, I was looking forward to reading another tale by the same author. I was disappointed. I didn't enjoy it and I didn't finish it.
B00FIUO8MI|2.0|loved the first two books. This book does not deliver. The writing does not flow and the characters are no longer as well formed in the previous books.
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|Anyone reading this is obviously a fan of Bob Dylan, and doesn't need me to tell them &#34;Blood on the Tracks&#34; is better than &#34;Self Portrait.&#34; However, there are 14 &#34;newly remastered&#34; titles in this mammoth box, and it's not readily apparent which are the 14, so here goes:<br /><br />1. Self Portrait<br />2. Dylan<br />3. Pat Garrett<br />4. Hard Rain<br />5. Street Legal<br />6. Live at Budokan<br />7. Saved<br />8. Real Live<br />9. Empire Burlesque<br />10.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|Because we needed to catch up with the missing season and were looking forward to it.We love this series. Thanks.
B001HN6918|5.0|If you have young children who want to see movies over and over, and if you do not want Netflix tied up or can't find streaming videos this is one answer. It is a cute, charming and entertaining tale. Nice illustration.
B00CJKW4WQ|5.0|The design of this keypad seems to be geared toward Apple's wireless keyboard, and I think that it would look great in that kind of setup.  I am using it with a MacBook Pro since I got tired of using the numbers on the MacBook keyboard.  Setup was easy and straightforward once I figured that I had to enter the code on the keypad and not the MacBook.  Keypad works just as expected, and also works as a stand alone calculator if I want.  I am not sure if I will bring this on trips, but it it is small and light enough to try.  Price is right, so if you want a numeric keypad for your iMac or your MacBook, this is worth it.
B00001U0E1|4.0|Agreat film to have in a collection on literary topics. I especially like the details which are fitted into the story.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Great movie, Denzel is truly one the best actors of all time and he shows us why in this performance.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|The author develops some interesting theories that could make theoretical sense. She gives &#34;assignments&#34; to help the reader try the theories on for size. First she needs to help the average reader develop some self discipline to do the assignments...
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Was disappointed with the ending. I still prefer the traditional fairy tale. Great, fast read overall. Every woman can identify with the characters in some way.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It captured me from the very beginning and I could relate to the situation.  It seemed so hopeless.  Heartwarming story
006202406X|5.0|Excellent book even thought many are criticizing the ending.  Brave choices all around by characters and author alike.  Great read!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson , superheroes, and post-apocalyptic/dystopian novels, so when I heard Sanderson was writing a post-apocalyptic dystopian superpower novel, I was quite excited.  Sanderson's 2013 Steelheart lives up to that promise, and is the beginning of another great series from Sanderson.<br /><br />The premise of the book is that some humans mysteriously begin developing superpowers after a comet...  asteroid...  something...  called Calamity appears in the sky.  But all the Epics, as the superpowered folk are called, go completely evil.  There are no superheroes, just megalomaniacs and murderers struggling with each other for power and domination of the normal people, with regular humans trying to stay our of the way.  Each Epic has a particular weakness, though, that can negate their powers, and a group of humans called the Reckoners are trying to fight back.<br /><br />One of the most powerful of these Epics is Steelheart, who has ruled Newcago for eight years after conquering the city of Chicago and killing the father of our protagonist, David, in the process.  David saw his father injure Steelheart, though, and he has grown up trying to piece together what Steelheart's weakness is and how to kill him.  At the beginning of the book, he hears the Reckoners are in town, and he sees the perfect opportunity to hook up with them to take out Steelheart.<br /><br />One of Sanderson's strongest points as a writer is his world-building.  That talent is on full display here as he crafts the dark new fictional world of Newcago and of the Epics and Reckoners.  Just as Sanderson has done with with the magic systems of his various fantasty novels such as the Mistborn series or Elantris , the way the Epics work is fascinating, full of quirks and interesting mysteries, and yet always self-consistent.  Newcago, the former Chicago dominated by Steelheart, is appropriately dark, oppressive, futuristic, and dangerous.<br /><br />Sanderson also writes great action sequences (the Mistborn series has some of the best fantasy action scenes I've ever read), and he knocks it out of the park on that front in Steelheart as well.  With the Epics, high-tech Reckoners, and Steelheart's personal army called Enforcement, there's no shortage of great action sequences that are both exciting and do a great job of illustrating the unique aspects of this setting.<br /><br />Steelheart is the first in a planned trilogy, and Sanderson does a great job of providing a satisfying conclusion to this book while leaving many threads open to pursue in future installments.  I can't wait to read the sequel, due in Fall 2014.  There's also supposedly talk of a film version, which I really hope comes to fruition.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Sanderson, superheroes, or dytopian fiction, I highly recommend Steelheart .  Sanderson has really done it again with this novel.  It's amazing how prolific he can be in so many different series while still keeping each so original and of such high quality.tion sequences (the Mistborn series has some of the best fantasy action scenes I've ever read), and he knocks it out of the park on that front in Steelheart as well.

B000QCSA54|5.0|Great little book, with much inspiration on how to be persistant (or not) as needed.  Sent to many friends who also found it very valuable
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Good, character-driven film. Surprisingly little gore, relying on plot and acting instead of buckets of entrails. I'm not a big fan of cgi, but this movie uses it very well. Has very little relationship to the book, if that matters to you.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Loved the whole thing but the last chapter! I guess the author didn't call me! Lol<br />Good read.....left open for a sequel, maybe.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|She writes so well! I thought this book was amazing! I love how the plot and story work out! It's awesome:)
0062255657|4.0|When we meet our narrator, he has returned to the rural England of his childhood to attend a funeral. Although the house of his youth has long since been demolished, he's drawn to the old farm at the end of the lane where he once lived -- and to a green bench beside a dingy pond that his childhood friend Lettie Hempstock always called an ocean. As he sits beside the water, he recalls the extraordinary events of his seventh year, when he first met Lettie and his life was changed in mysterious and irrevocable ways.<br /><br />For its relatively short length, [[ASIN:0062255657 The Ocean at the End of the Lane]] is a big book with a lot of subtext. I'm actually not quite sure where to start with this review, since so much happens within its 178 pages. I don't have much experience with Neil Gaiman, and no experience with his adult novels ([[ASIN:0060530944 The Graveyard Book]] and [[ASIN:0380807343 Coraline]] being the only other books of his I've read), and I think that worked in my favor here. It was such a pleasure to be taken by surprise within the first few pages of this novel and utterly transported to a strange new world.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0062255657 Ocean]] is an atmospheric, disturbing, and thoughtful reading experience. The events that occur within its pages are horrific and otherworldly, and they are relayed expertly by Gaiman in his seven-year-old narrator's voice. He writes about adulthood from the perspective of a child, and about childhood from the perspective of an adult. And I think he just nails it. So many of the rich details that he includes are the very things that a child would observe and remember: the taste of burnt toast, the bend of a comic book, a yellow washbasin that is the perfect size. At its heart, [[ASIN:0062255657 Ocean]] is a book about the magic of childhood, which seems like an island in a vast ocean that adults can't reach -- or maybe don't even remember exists.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, a few of the scenes in this novel are downright terrifying and will probably give you chills. The scariest scenes are not the fantastical ones, either; they are scenes based entirely in reality, which makes them even more frightening. Gaiman's writing is masterful as he weaves his dark and horrific fairy tale with elements of mythic fantasy and coming-of-age. Really, the writing is just incredible, and heartbreaking in more than one instance. A lot of the fantastical element is left to interpretation, which I think just makes this book better; not everything needs to be explained in great detail to work in the narrative. Nor should it be explained, in this case, since our narrator is a seven-year-old and can only tell us what he sees, feels, and knows.<br /><br />Here are a couple of my favorite passages from this novel:<br /><br />\\"I'm going to tell you something important. Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world.\\"<br /><br />\\"I do not miss childhood, but I miss the way I took pleasure in small things, even as greater things crumbled. I could not control the world I was in, could not walk away from things or people or moments that hurt, but I found joy in the things that made me happy.\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:0062255657 The Ocean at the End of the Lane]] is an immersive, magical tale, and I definitely recommend it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|the best game I have ever played in my life no game can be better than this game no joke
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Great sound, headset stays on no matter what, noise cancelling, really easy set-up, easy to keep clean. Only downside it may hurt ears, and also easy to break-in.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is loads of fun... I play it everyday. My boyfriend is even hooked on it! It's great that there are so many different rooms.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|Some decent action but ultimately a big let down.  The first problem with this movie is that it is about 40 minutes of mediocre to good action surrounded by about 80 minutes of political pandering.<br /><br />The second problem is this movie wants badly to be Die Hard but doesn't do a very good job.  Our main character John, has a rocky family life and gets caught in a building with terrorists trying to stop them.  It's like someone made a spreadsheet with all the things that they thought made Die Hard great and tried to copy it.<br /><br />From the huge chunk of the movie dealing with the President who achieves peace in the Middle East and the evil businessmen afraid of losing government contracts to uninspired by-the-numbers action it's no surprise this movie did so poorly.<br /><br />2 stars for some moments of entertaining action.
B00G32TD98|4.0|It was pretty good.  There are a lot of haunted house cliches,  but the cast is terrific.  I enjoyed it, but I expected it to be scarier from all the reviews I'd read.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I've never been shy about liking Angry Birds. I just really enjoy the games. I'm not even a Star Wars fan, but dammit did I enjoy this game. My only disappointment is I've already gotten 3 stars on all boards and am awaiting an update. The game is well made and gives a lite Angry Birds retelling of the events of the Star Wars prequels.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|The reality of this linear space we live in gets very distorted by viewing it only through the lens of news programs, and here say. This is not a put down to news programs. They have only a small window of time to tell a story, but unfortunately the untold leads to misunderstandings. I think this book goes a long way towards bridging the gap for a better understanding of our brothers and sisters everywhere, and ultimately bring love, peace, and prosperity for EVERYONE. My heart felt thanks go out to everyone who made this book possible, and especially Malala, her family, and friends. I am just sorry that it some times it takes something like this to bring people together.
B00F08ADX6|5.0|I got this game for my toddler and she enjoys it very much as is able to play it. It's very similar in gameplay to the sleepwalker game that is out.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|If you are a music lover this film is so very interesting and very informative.  Nicely done. I highly recommend it.
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|I've been looking for a cart racer for the kindle without loading an emulator and roms for Mario Kart, so getting this really helped my fix in that regard. To add to that I'm already enjoying the PC counterpart as well.<br /><br />If you want a cart racing fix this is a solid bet, but I encourage most to change the controls right off the bat from default which seems to be set to a style which wants you to tilt your device to make turns, this would be fine on a phone, but on a tablet I find it disagreeable in actual practice.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think this app is great<br />You will like it try it for yourself is it cold or hot to hot
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You should definitely get this! It's so fun! If you like subway surfers, you'll like this better! Even if you don't like subway surfers....... you'll love this!!!!! Get it now!!!!!!!! It's AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it!!!!! I play it every day!!!!!!!! Don't miss out!!!!!!! (You would hate to miss out!!!!!)
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far, so good.  I'm not that far into this game yet,  but I'll give it a 4 star rating.
B009K72G8I|5.0|I liked Star Wars as a movie so I had high expectation for the animation. The whole Clone Wars exceeded my expectation and it is great. I can watch it over and over anytime...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I would not know what to do without candy crush and I love you more because now I can play it on my kindle so thanks
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This is a very great read. A must get!<br />This book is filled with adventure. So if you like dogs and adventure books this is the one for you!
B008JFUO36|3.0|This film relays heavily on an intriguing story line. This approach works well - you are around half way through the film before you can really start to understand what is going on and have a feel for the plot line. This movie doesn't move particularly quickly, and the slow methodical approach defines the film. The graphics and the world they create are pretty incredible. Despite the graphics and special effects the winding plot makes the movie more thought provoking than many post apocalyptic Sci-fi type movies. I enjoyed the acting as well. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a repair technician tasked with repairing drones on a largely decimated planet earth. His character evolves the most throughout the film. Morgan Freeman also play and interesting role.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this was an average film. I enjoyed watching it but I will not be in a hurry to watch again. The plot dragged at times and the ending was not satisfying in my opinion.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Wow. Amazing. Easy to use. Its like my iphone is a remote which is sweet.  Good quality. Good Sound. Would recommend.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is the prime example of a band maturing without losing their collective fire. It loses nothing of Stryper's 80s heritage, just applies it to seasoned musicianship. Production values are wonderful (you can actually hear the bass). All your signature<br />Stryper elements included: Harmony vocals, face melting solos, Michael Sweet high notes
B009EEQAT8|5.0|Simply wonderful movie. Not typically a &#34;cartoon&#34; movie fan, but this one was very well done. One of my favorite Clooney films.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun to play. Once I get going I can't put it down. Makes you think about your moves. Takes up time in the Dr.s office.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|This book was amazing! I read it in a day! I fell in love with the characters instantly just by reading the sample on here. I had to buy it. I know I will be reading more books by Kristen Zimmer in the future.
B00E89VXQY|3.0|Orion was not recorded live. I expected the whole setlist to be live recorded. There were two shows to choose the best recording for this release.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|Good APU for the price, you can play some good games without a graphic card. Compatible with Linux for gaming.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This will be a book I remember for many years to come. I am glad I took the to time to read it.
B000KZFMZI|3.0|I love love love friends and have watched them so many times I have lost count!  This show is wonderful and still makes me laugh out loud!  With that said I am disappointed in Amazon for having the digital versions cut! Several episodes have scenes missing, nothing huge but for someone who has seen them multiple times I quickly noticed the difference. I have the discs and am wondering why they would cut them poorly!  Digital copies should be the full versions!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Amazing book for something that was written when I was 5!!!! I couldn't put this book down! I probably won't read another one unless there will be a movie out.
B003JTHWJQ|3.0|Under the light of science and his rich literary talent he finds liberty to attack, insult, criticize and trash all things relegion. Even though I get his points and reasoning and agree with most of it, I found the book a repetitive pattern of jargon and continuous attacks and talks agains religious views which he argues with reference and intelligence. I think that's boring! Definitely not an entertaining read.  He kept repeating the same argument over and over from different perspective. I was just flipping pages for half of the book till I realized there is actually something to learn from this book and that is: proper english, new vocabulary and clever use of words. Since that point I felt better about buying this book! Overall, I probably can point to 3-4 paragraph from the book that was enlightening for me. I was expecting more inspirations, scientific not rhetoric, from this read.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I got this so I could have access to my account from anywhere without killing the battery life on my cellphone
B00G32OER4|5.0|This was based on a true story book about real life investigators of demonology, not some made up fantasy like most horror flicks.<br />Very disturbing, can identify with some of it ,of course it's Hollywoodized with special effects
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is highly addictive. I play it on my computer, my cellphone and my Kindle. Some levels are a pain but overall I love this game
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Did its job. I charge a cell phone (Focus) and my kindle with this chord. Came quick and I have been using it for 6 months +
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I got this app so I can search things on my Kindle easier. I didn't realize I have a different search engine on it already
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Not a great movie, but glad I waited until it was out of theaters because I would have been upset to pay full theater price for this movie.
B005F96UNM|5.0|One of my favorite films that went by nearly unnoticed.<br />You won't be disappointed!<br />Great cast, wonderful characters and one of the coolest films visually ever in my opinion!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great movie and filled with lot's of tidbits of info that make a person reflect on the time this movie represents and our current day challenges.  Staying the course and holding firm to your convictions to do what's right over what's popular is important if you want to keep your hear high and live w/o regret.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|Great read. Couldn't put it down. Great descriptive journey into 17th century the Dutch golden age. I am now a big fan of Vermeer , whereas before, I was ignorant to his works.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great time killer. I love that you can advance WITHOUT spending real money if you choose. Plus you dont need an internet connection to play.  Loaded it on my Galaxy note 8 and works flawlessly.
B009949RKC|5.0|Carrie is always an excellent choice - especially for Halloween! I love sissy spacek and her crazy mom. They play their roles perfectly. Excellent!
B003MWHVLY|5.0|love this album. great music. she never disappoints even when I don't love all the songs there are enough to make me listen
B008PC1GF8|5.0|Never did I ever think I would be writing this review when I focused on the von Karajan and Giulini performances of Bruckner’s grand 8th Symphony.  They both conduct the same Weiner Philharmoniker in the famous great hall of the Musikverein in Vienna in what looks like much the same year. I do not think I have ever heard the same piece of music performed so well by anyone, much less by these two  acclaimed conductors working with the same very great orchestra in what appears to be the same year. Von Karajan and the Berliner Philharmoniker have a long history of having been associated with Bruckner.  But Giulini became more associated with Bruckner’s music later in his career. Whereas von Karajan has done the whole recorded cycle of Bruckner with the Berliner Philharmoniker -- that cycle now available on Amazon at a knock-out price -- Giulini, as far as I can find out, has available recorded performances only of the 2nd, 7th(2), 8th, and 9th(2)  --all of which I have -- but did not do the full cycle that so many accomplished conductors are doing today.<br /><br />Why this review of two different performances of the same piece? Well, for one thing they both used different versions of it but both hit home runs!  And it took a lot of courage to write this. Just look at the abundance of the enthusiastic reviews for both performances from very sophisticated music professionals. Who wants to add another to that bulging list? Surely there are many of those contributing who can dissect the music much better than I. But I was blown away by these two performances after listening to them twice back to back. They are cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me and rate a lot more acclaim than I can render. These are unbelievable performances. I am not saying these are the best out there. They are the best I have ever heard, and I have given away a number of other performances. Nothing I have heard in the past even comes close to these two. That is my message. Both are so singularly excellent.<br /><br />For a number of reasons I will not go into I was disinclined to purchase the von Karajan performance…until I read the reviews. “OK,”I said, “I’ll bite.”  It was a revelation.  What a magnificent performance. It was like von Karajan had grown up with Bruckner, knew his every thought and loved every nuance, although who can imagine two more disparate personalities? But here is a sensuous  performance led by a man and orchestra who obviously know and feel Bruckner very well. And with the 7th, 8th, and 9th, to me “feeling” is a key word. Technical capacity and performance, yes!  But feeling in a noble way expressed in this music is so rarely and excellently done. Get it and treasure it. There are very few performances on this level. It is simply in another world.<br /><br />But hold it! The Giulini is in that other world too! It ranks with the von Karajan performance.  Can anyone endure this tidal wave performance? I was washed out after listening to both of these performances. The Giulini performance sounds to me like a live performance on disc. (I have an older ArkivMusik reproduction of the DG recording from a few years back, and it told me nothing except the times of each symphony segment. Remember that about ArkivMusik.  if you order a reproduction of anything out of circulation, it may be without notes of any kind.) Whether a live performance or no –and I believe it is live because most of what Giulini recorded in the late 80’s with Vienna was live, including his  stately Brahms symphonies and requiem--  it is a living propulsion! Not only is Giulini’s performance tender, elegant, thunderous, and majestic, but its flow is unutterably beautiful. Listen to the heavenly harp in the Adagio!  I never thought I would find a performance  equal to the von Karajan, but certainly this one is.<br />I recommend them both. Personally I believe the reason these two resonate so well with Bruckner’s music is their lifelong immersion in Opera. They are used to long performances and keeping myriads of specifics in mind all the time. These long symphonies demand an extended concentration, like one has to have in Opera. Certainly there are many others who do that well too.<br /><br />I would hate to have to choose between these historic performances. I treasure them both. But if one had to purchase only one, and you asked me, I personally would purchase the Giulini. But that is just me. I love the other one just as much. I have them both so I do not have to choose. When I want to listen to the Bruckner 8th, it doesn’t matter which I put on. I know what is coming! Unparalleled pleasure.  At last look, they were both available through Amazon.  Run for them!e used to long performances and keeping myriads of specifics in mind all the time. These long symphonies demand an extended concentration, like one has to have in Opera.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I appsoluty adore this app. It is so much fun. I strongly encourage it. It is like making your own bacon or sausage. Luv it. :-)
B00821OX98|3.0|The constant horrible music is what bothers me most. Why do so many producers think that the viewer needs music to understand how they should feel at a given point in the show. Especially moments when it's supposed to be touching, goes strait to a Disney flck. I would have given this show 4 stars but the music just bugs me too much, not to mention some shoddy acting here and there.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS DVD!  Okay, so I started a diet and exercise program back in March of this year as I had 50 pounds to lose.  I started running 1-2 miles 5 days a week and now run 3-4 miles 5 days a week.  I lost my first 40 pounds but have been unable to lose the last 10 (very stubborn) pounds.  I have watched and maintained a healthy diet, quit all my soda, candy and crap and have really stuck to it, so it was upsetting that I could not get this last 10 pounds off.  I searched the web thinking I needed to do more than just cardio and came across Jillian Michaels 30 day shred. I thought, wow only 20 minutes a day? I can do this. Well let me tell you. I burned just as many caloriesa with the 20 minute workout as I do running 2.5 miles.  And, I thought I was in pretty good shape and when I do the workouts, I can feel muscles I didn't even know I had.  If anyone is considering buying this DVD, you totally should. Definitely has made a difference. My abs, back and thighs are getting toned, and I feel great.<br /><br />There are a few reviews that say Jillian is annoying or you get bored with doing each of the 3 levels for 10 days.  I have not been bored.  The time flies by and I have so much energy.  I can't wait to purchase another one of her dvds.  Great buy!
B0086449YA|5.0|INSTANT CLASSIC !!!!! MARK KNOFFLER AT HIS BEST. HE COULD SING NURSERY RHYMES ALONG WITH HIS CLASSIC GUITAR AND PEOPLE WOULD LISTEN.
1419701533|5.0|My daughter (age 7) has been reading one of these books and loves it.  She took it out of the library and has been carrying it around reading it on her own.  We read all the time and anything that encourages reading (especially independent reading) makes me happy.  Good value with this box set and timely arrival.  This is going to make my daughter happy to see under the tree for Christmas.
B00EXVZZE8|1.0|I got this app for free on my iPad, the fact that I paid for this shows a bias. I was okay forking over a buck but seriously istom games? The ads are still pesky on an app that actually paid for? If I paid for an app that is free on iPad I definitely expect to get my money's worth with maybe an ad free game. But no you decide to include the ads to a paid game just so you can make more money.<br />Incredibly selfish!! I definitely will not be looking forward to any games by greedy istom.
B000I186FW|5.0|I love this movie.  It's a great movie.  All about the corruption of too much power and how people abuse that power.  At which point your government is no longer a government, it's just ruling with an iron fist.  My girlfriend loves it too which is why we decided that on the 5th of November we were going to have a V for Vendetta day.  Remember remember the 5th of November....
B009X2CUYA|4.0|Kate Morton books are always a good read enjoyable from start to finish I haven't read one of her books that is bad
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|We had the free version first, and we are so glad we upgraded to the full version.  There are so many more options and games in this full version.  We love these types of apps and are especially happy with the 22learn, LLC ones.  We also have the abby monkey one and the kids just love them.  My 3 year old, especially, is loving them.  She plays this app more than any of the others and I can see the progress she makes daily after playing this app.  I love them because they are super simple to navigate for the kids, so I can just let them play and I know they aren't getting into other things on my Kindle.  I also love that the apps teach them such a wide range of skills with very fun games, so that they want to keep playing and they don't get bored quickly and turn it off.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Excellent book from start to finish the Hunger Games books are one of the very best series I have ever read
B007A2O3FO|5.0|No car chases, explosions, etc.  Just words spoken in a sort of time capsule; a quiet corner of a turbulent world.  It would be a good film for family watching, if today's restless kids wouldn't be bored by it.  (I'm not a kid and mine are grown.)
B00873GRU4|5.0|Loved it from cover to cover you just cannot put this book down a must read for the whole series
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I've read a few books about John and Abigail and their family;  this series illustrates the time and tensions they lived in very well.<br />It also shows that their family faced many of the problems we do today, with parents so absorbed in their work there's not enough time for their children...or seeming to favor some more than others.<br />Strong performances from all of the actors, the people they portray made some tough decisions to risk everything for their principles.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Fabulous read from cover to cover couldn't put it down, Nicholas Sparks writes great books especially if you like a love story
B000059HB7|5.0|This film has been on tv countless times, but many funny, special, humanizing moments had been edited out.  For instance, did you know that John Wayne kissed Walter Brennan, and Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin sang two songs?  Little things like that tend to tone down all the gunsmoke.<br />Nice to see Ward Bond again, too.  Good story, fun to watch, I miss the good guys today.
1451683405|4.0|I'm always a fan of what Harris has to say. This essay provides evidence for looking at your life in ways that shouldn't seem new but do.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|There's the great cast, wonderful sets and cinematography, but of most interest to me is the depiction of the beginning of transition for British society.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Upgrade habitats to make more room for the Dragons because it is not good to be unable to get a new habitat Intel you level up. Funny thing that's the problem I have right now
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Decided to read this book after seeing the movie earlier this year.  It is more violent than books I typically read and disturbing to read about this dystopic society where teenagers are pitted against each other for punishment by the country'  leaders and for sick entertainment of citizens (l guess there is worse levels of reality television beyond Keeping up With the Kardashians and Honey Boo Boo!?!)  Nonetheless,  it is definitely a page turner and Katniss (the main character) is someone who you as the reader are brought to care about and root for.  I am looking forward to Book II and the upcoming movie.  And SPOILER ALERT........finding out if she chooses Peeta or Gale as her love interest.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|The acting is as horrible as the storyline. The cgi isn't even that great. Save your money and wait until it comes out on cable. You can thank me later.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|A different avenue for Connelly, good writing from a fellow that exceeds when he has the space to expound on character and ie novels
1451666179|5.0|As I'm sure must be clear by the tremendous number of positive reviews on this page, everyone loves this book by Allie Brosh.  Allie's work is a unique blend of stylized art and prose--a little like a present-day James Thurber meets David Sedaris.<br /><br />I've been following her blog since shortly after it debuted and was thrilled to be able to purchase her first book.  It contains about half blog content and half new material, just the right mix of revisiting old favorite stories and enjoying new ones.<br /><br />While the book maintains the blog's goofy sense of humor, like Allie's work generally, it's become something more than just silly stories. The last couple of chapters especially touched on something more meaningful and real, and gave me a similar feeling to reading good fiction--a sense of learning something about myself and growing as a person.<br /><br />I hope Allie will keep making these real things, and keep putting up with all of us loving her work so much.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I think that he is absolutely in his realm in the law novel area. Characters, motive, and relationships are true life believable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is fun, addicting, and just great. My brother and sister love it. Its a mix between temple run, subway surfer, and despicable me
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Most of the works about NDE's have a basic flaw in that the person had some prior religious background or training that probably shaded their believability. When a man that is trained in science and is only casually religious reports some of the same experiences, it's certainly  time to take heed. Dr. Alexander told of things that I have long believed but had little base from whence to draw. I see that my beliefs are more than hopeful wishes. Thank You Dr. Alexander.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I'm a big fan of the TV show The Big Bang Theory, and one of my favorite characters on the Show is the very eccentric Sheldon Cooper, a guy who has very precise rules for himself and the other people in his life.  The protagonist of this book reminded me a lot of Sheldon Cooper.<br /><br />This book focuses almost completely on the main character's quest to find a romantic partner.  None of the other characters were very well developed at all, but the story was still charming and engrossing.  It was well-written and had an easy to follow, yet creative plot.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a sweet, funny and unconventional love story without many \\"mushy\\" bits.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|I like the author, but not this character. Short stories seem to rob the author from building his caracters and situations
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game. Your crops grow while u r off line. If you need more neighbors you are absolutely able to add me. My farm I'd is FAUKHKH. My farm name is sweet farm. Now, please add me! Thanks! Enjoy the game it's extremely fun!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham is the master of storytelling. He requires no degree to understand what he is spinning, and almost anyone that can read can clearly understand what he is writing about. Characters are believable you've probably someone like them. Great read
B008J2GAKU|4.0|I haven't read any of the Marvel or DC comic mainstays in well over a decade, and I have to admit I thought that most of what they were both putting out seemed cliche even before I stopped.  I also didn't jump back on board last year when the new 52 was released, but the recent low price deal on a number of the Batman related new 52 vol 1's for Kindle readers got me to take the plunge.<br /><br />Am I glad I did! The Court of Owls is well written and expertly drawn.  The story pulled me in and I really enjoyed the look back at an older Gotham and the Wayne family men who built it. I also really like the mix of pure action and mind bending weirdness associated with the Talon.<br /><br />I'm hooked and will be buying the volumes as they release.  If you loved Batman as a kid/teen, this is a great series to pick up and get back in touch. Great art and an even better story.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. Those of s who are dog lovers will immediately love it and people that have not known the joy of having a dog love them, may see a new insight
0399215921|2.0|Every other book we have by this author is great, so I decided to get this for my son. When it arrived, I was amazed how small the book is, about the size of a piece of bologna. In the first day our son lost it like 3 times.<br />The story is short and meaningless and it's hard to make out the main character because he's so tiny.<br />I will buy more of Erics work, hopefully his others aren't stinkers like this one.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|An achingly beautiful tale filled with wonders that you wish you knew more about... just go on and read it!
B001B1UO6W|5.0|WOW!!!This brought back old memories :-) Movie was awesome and this &#34;20th Birthday Edition&#34; was actually way worth it compared to the regular one. Cheers to the seller for keeping this item in very very good condition all this time.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great freaking game. Great graphics great guns realistic  I can't find. A single thing wrong with it completely love it awesome
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A great follow up to the first book.  Ken Follett evokes the emotions of the times that heroes were made.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This was awesome today and tomorrow I am going to get a book like this awesome cool amazing book of Mormon
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game. Can't wait for this creative group to release more games and expand this one. I enjoy HO games and this one is the best hands down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LUV THIS APP!!! Every since I downloaded it I can't stop playing it.... JUST CAN'T LET IT GO....... I play it all of the time even got my 4 yr old daughter playing it. My husband didn't care to much for it but he has com around nd now plays it....
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you like puzzles this is the app for you. It is as close to real as it gets. Great fun. Not too easy not too hard. Puzzlers won't be disappointed.
B0053R3J7G|5.0|The 10 year old we gave this to - loved it and put it together right away.  Very well made.

B001O1O71C|5.0|Good book I had to read it for school and I read It in a day! U should read it!!!
0345803507|1.0|What a waste of time and money to read. Maybe adolescents would be titillated, but (hopefully) not mature adults.  Flipped through for the &#34;good parts&#34;, but just laughed (or yawned).
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My lil boy who is 5 loves this game! It's a lil harder than I thought it would be but he plays it all the time!! It has different types of &quot;birds&quot; that u fling and it keeps him busy when he doesn't have the internet! He's 5 &amp; he can play it!!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The show based on strong characters, solid plot,amazing<br />actors.I wish we hade more shows that are so intelligent.<br />I would recommend it anyone who is looking for good quality entertainment.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|I Love it, a must have for a fan of his. I Can listen to it from beginning to end!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|For the very first time, this book made me wish my blog had a huge following.  I think everyone should read E-Squared. Although it’s not specifically written for teens, any young adult would love it.  In 157 short pages, your mind will be set spinning in a new direction.  It will bring you to a place you had never noticed existed.  Most importantly, it will open up a whole world of new possibilities.<br /><br />Yes, your thoughts create your reality-blah, blah, blah.  You’ve heard it over and over without it making a dent in your consciousness.  You say you believe it but do you really believe it until you see it? E-Squared brings that phrase to life, with nine fun, easy experiments that prove it.  Pam Grout has a breezy, friendly way of writing that reminds you of talking to your next door neighbor.  Although the content is monumental, the book is never serious (aka boring).<br /><br />In one experiment, the reader is supposed to declare the intent to look for green cars in the following 24 hours, to prove that what you think, you create, or, believing is seeing.  Pam Grout does warn at some point in the book that God, The Universe, The Source, or whatever you might call it, has a sense of humor. So over the next 24 hours, I looked for green cars, drove all over, went to the mall with a parking lot full of cars, and did not see a single one. I thought that maybe people don’t drive green cars anymore.  Maybe I should have picked silver–there’s plenty of those.  Just as my 24 hours was nearly up, I stopped at a light.  There was a green car in front of me, one behind me, one waiting in oncoming traffic.  There were several in the parking lot of the strip mall to my right.  Green cars were passing through the intersection. I started laughing.  The light turned green and I turned.  In the next half mile to my house, I saw green pickup trucks, more green cars, a green lawn care truck.  There must have been thirty, all in the space of a half mile! Some sense ofhumor!<br /><br />The next day, in the same experiment, the reader is supposed to look for yellow butterflies.  I said, life is too short to waste on this–I went right for the big stuff.  Instead, I looked for what is great about my son and sure enough, I saw it in him. Do you see the possibilities?  You can look for anything and see it!<br /><br />This experiment is not a fluke.  All the others work and are equally entertaining/open a world of possibilities. I do have to say, I especially liked the Jenny Craig experiment, where you lose weight without changing how you eat or doing ANYTHING!<br /><br />I now keep a list of the nine experiments on my desk and regularly use about five of them to create my reality and reassure myself that I’m not alone, that there is some force in the universe that connects us all.<br /><br />I’m not going to do my usual what I liked and did not like about the book because there’s nothing I didn’t like about it. And, I loved E-Squared and think that if it were mandatory reading in school, the world would transform.
B00FX8CLSI|5.0|This is a fantastic book that is as good or even better than the first one.  I have yet to see a book by J.D. Lenzen that was not an excellent resource for paracord ties!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|When I need a quick play or escape from work, Subway Surfer offers a great distraction. Love it. Just enough challenge to the levels of play and entertaining extras.
1451666179|5.0|It's not often a book can make you laugh, cringe, cry, and go &#34;OMG YES!&#34; all together.  It's like she's in my head with some of her stories... especially Depression and Identity.  I sat down and read through it within an hour and a half and then immediately handed it to my mom and told her it's something she needs to read.  I hope Allie puts out another one!
B003G94BZC|5.0|This is 'Doctor Who' back into the groove.  I hated the sexual digressions --- a reflection of the new-found liberality of a formerly repressive society, (imbedded into which this TV program is), that manifested as a passing fad in a few episodes in this series --- which only distracted from the original, 'platonic' tone that has carried through this long-running series and afforded a dispassionate consideration of issues confronting humanity in an increasingly complex world.
B001OSIV62|5.0|love this movie, it is a true story, this could never happen now.  But it was amazing how he did this, way back then.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|It has been one of the most cleverly written ablums I have ever listened to by Eminem or any other artist.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Amazon, you need to remove the pop up that keeps saying to update Facebook. It keeps taking us to the Google Play Store. When Facebook sends an update out for the android apps you need to get an update for the kindle.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|so awesome you get to buy and breed your own Dragons.You also get to feed and get to collect coins and Evolve your own Dragons
B006GWO5NE|3.0|It takes too long to charge. It seems like it takes longer to charge than my previous one...so I give it an ok rating
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Everything may have already been said in others' reviews, however, this is greatness! The energy level is unbelievable. Not desperate &#34;we need to be relevant&#34; energy, but rather &#34;we love what we are doing&#34; energy. I have been a fan since Soldiers,and I agree with everyone; this is easily on par with their best. Not often these days that I listen to a band/release &#34;cover to cover&#34; and find my enjoyment growing on each listen. Great sound, great hooks, great songs. You have to get this one...
B002UWH8P6|4.0|The Stargate Univere series has reasonable sci-fi features and somewhat believable human drama that makes you look forward to the next sceen.
B001D6OKJ2|5.0|If you love Bill Evans, you love everything of Bill Evans.  For others, his piano work will move you. Like others I know, we enjoy the Sunday Village music recordings.
0143057812|5.0|This is one of my favorite reads of all time.  It has everything - mystery, adventure, and romance.  Zag on has created a masterpiece.
B00EUUJID6|4.0|I like the songs. I saw them in concert, they are fantastic. They have beautiful voices, all three of them.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly and Pauline Collins turn in fabulous performances in this heart-stirring story of retired professional musicians who must adapt as they age.  I have watched it six times and never tire of it.  It is based on a true story and a lot of the characters are acted -- all well -- by retired musicians.  Kudos to Dustin Hoffman!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|been diagnosed with demintia and now I consider this one of my brain games. it keeps me thinking. now if I can figure out how to finish some of the levels I will be doing good.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I think it was interesting in some places and dragged on in others. There were parts that made me stop reading to think about what I had read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a fun game that was challenging but not impossible to play.  Hope to see more games in the future.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|My husband was watching I Dream of Jeannie episodes on the computer, so I thought for his rapidly upcoming 50th birthday I would buy him the boxed set. He LOVES it. I couldn't have thought of a better present. We watch a couple of episodes almost every night. I have to admit some of them are very funny. Roger is such a dope. I haven't had any of the problems that other reviewers have complained about. Maybe I lucked out? I'm very glad I purchased this set.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addictive game and I highly reccomend it. It is tons of fun. It seems to be one of the most popular games out there right now and this particular version is completely flawless in my opinion!!!
B003Y5H574|2.0|It wasn't what I thought it would be.  I didn't like the story line and although it turned out alright, I was disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series by Suzanne Collins! So very well written...Thought I would re-read the second book in preparation for the second movie that will be released in a few short weeks. Excited to visit one of my besties for the midnight show.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is my favorite all time move.  I have probably watched it 100 times, I never get tired of it!  Acting is superb, I love a happy ending, but sometimes I am okay with a sad ending as well.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Engaging till the end. Loved it! Not your typical zombie movie...filled with action and drama blended just the right way.
B00DL2W7Q4|3.0|David and Goliath starts off with great promise and rock-solid stories of how the underdog can come up trumps  - however it finishes with an under powered, overly complex sequence of stories that lack punch and relevancy. The story regarding Northern Ireland's 30 years of trouble is left hanging in the air with no sound conclusion or learning -opportunity provided by Gladwell - I'm left guessing what the point of the story was and how it supports the central premise of his book.<br /><br />From such an accomplished author - with may great books to his name - this is my least favourite book. Try 'Blink' for a batter introduction to his works.
1592407889|5.0|This book was an absolute page turner. I could not put it down. I felt sorry for Sachi. I am a fan of her mother Shirley MacLaine, but now I have a new perspective. I just don't understand why movie stars have children if they are too self centered to be there for them. Poor Sachi I really felt bad for this girl.
B00FJMK9VE|3.0|As a long time Stryper fan (bought first cassette in 86) I wish I could rate this higher but I just can't.  These songs just don't seem to have the raw edge I came to enjoy in their previous albums.
B005P3NPXG|5.0|Seal is a very good soulful artist. Reminds one of singing heard years ago. There is a lot of emotion on his singing.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|Nicely done!! It runs along the line of the Grudge...sort of. A couple scenes made me jump a little and that's a big thing because I never jump.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|We all love this movie, from my husband to the grown kids to the grandkids!  Watching the kids' faces as they watch the movie is worth any price paid for it.  They love the Disney version, of course, as well as the old Mary Martin version - but this one is the movie that completely captures their attention.  I don't know if it's because of the young, real-live actors, up-to-date special effects, or the different look of PJ Hogan's Peter Pan, but they love it, and that's good enough for me!  It's a little scary in parts maybe for some kids (maybe between 4-7), but for younger kids, they could care less.  The older kids, (7-10) if they still watch these films, may love it!
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|This movie was very different from other zombie movies which was a good surprise. This is probably the only movie that could make zombies a possibility in the future. It was kind of creepy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is very very very fun for all ages they have so many minions you can buy and different places you can unlock I love this game so if you are thinking of getting this game I recommend it!!!!!  :)
B00FPH6A70|4.0|I chose this rating because it's one of those scary movies you can actually see happening. It wasn't over the top but very well done.
B00125WAWS|3.0|It is a good motivational movie but I think the movie is too overrated.  Some circumstances and scenes look somewhat exaggerated.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Very interesting concepts into how habits are formed and how to go about changing them to better habits
B00G32TD98|4.0|This movie was very intense and it has been a long time since a movie keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout.
B0042JSMV4|5.0|Every edge and corner you'll want is in this book. Good for edging baby blankets, hankies, Tee shirts, skirt hems, sleeves, pockets and so on... A must for my collection... Birdie Gee
B0059QJ2D6|5.0|I've seen the movie when it first came out and thought it was one of the best films I'd ever seen....which is why I want to see it again.
B00622D3BS|5.0|Ryan Gosling. That's all you need to know. But I need more words to fill up this stupid review to rate it.
B00D29CBIU|5.0|Well written and fresh approach to powerful topic, one that effects each of us everyday. How to create wealth and income in our lives.  Also, clean and insightful explanation of how Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), which takes some of the 'Woo Woo' aspects out and allows the reader to understand just how to use this powerful tool to achieve what the desire most in their world and what may be the reason they have not achieved it at this point in life.<br /><br />Great resource to getting past the limiting thoughts, beliefs, and programs; which may or may not be aware of in your day to day thinking.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book if you are seeking to move past old patterns and beliefs to achieve goals.
B003B02O7I|4.0|Fun reading...Then a quick ending.I have never been disappointed with a Grisham novel.An easy way to learn some basic law.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|deep purple burn it up , in this fantastic hard rock classic. the sound is excellent on this dvd and this is before they went funky. The band was at their peak here and this was a fine addition to their catalog.  There are some bonus tracks on this one. But if you enjoy the great sounds of this band circa the early 70's. It's not as great as 'machine head' or 'who do we think we are'  or ' in rock' but it's a up there near those efforts.  This is clear sounding and masterful hard rock done by excellent musicians. who are bound for the rocfk and roll hall of fame.  Well they better make it this time!.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Rick Riordon is a genius. He always has me captivated and on the edge of my seat. My advice to you is to get this book now
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like the game but don't like the time outs and that you have to pay $ if you want to keep playing bf the time out is done.  And I don't like it that I ran out of levels to play but there are more if you pay $ or go on facebook.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I have not been so drawn into a book for a long time. A well written morality tale; but so much more. The frailties of the flesh, the line between right and wrong; how we can so unknowingly impact others  lives. I often caught myself holding my breath. Never would have figured out the ending. After reading so many crummy books, it was a delight to read from a real writer. Buy it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game to pass the time,  but doesn't require a lot of thought or deductive reasoning.  Would recommend for all ages.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Classic can not go wrong and it was free for my Kindle thank you Amazon. It was great to reread this book after all the Twilight fades this will remain.
B000VZE398|5.0|One of the few groups I listen to who sounds as good or even better live than in the studio, both being excellent.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|Excellent family movie!  Great for holiday family watching.  Warm and feel good movie!  Great time for children to reflect on the many blessings they sometimes take for granted.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book was a very disappointing ending to the series...I'd really like to know why she chose to go that direction... :(
B003THJA1G|4.0|The characters are likable and the interaction between them is engaging.  I like the relationship Castle has with his daughter.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this book. I couldn't put it down. Great story, can't wait to start on second one in series. Loved it.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I really liked this book, but I didn't relate to the main character of this book as well as other characters in Gillian Flynn's novels.  However, if you like a smart, fun read then I would suggest this book.
1451627289|5.0|A great &#34;what if&#34; type of book.  It thows in both fantasy and a remarkable amount of actual true history.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Love this watch. This is my second. I'm a contractor and my last one took more abuse than most people could dish out in a lifetime. It's been covered in drywall mud, concrete, paint, etc and kept on ticking. It finally met its match while taking some serious abuse during wake boarding at a local lake. These watches are great because they are inexpensive, look great, and simply do what they're supposed to without any fuss. I'll keep buying them.
B00987MQRQ|1.0|For the 9+ dollars I spent on this book I felt it was too short and repetitive.  Did not go into any character development. The drawings at end were good, but I was hoping for a more in depth read. Good idea, poor execution.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Best album in years!!  By far the greatest lyricist in the game and hasnt lost a step on the competition.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is absolutely addictive! I first played in an arcade; this is a great version to take with you. My whole family from the three-year-old up to my husband enjoy playing. It is a great incentive for the kids to do their chores.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|The game is ok.  I've been playing only because I'm bored. Friends are sending me tokens and I'm not receiving them. When I play against other players as nd I only have one card left and the other two players have five and eight cards left I'm ALWAYS in 4th place. Something not right there. The game is not very useful in spite of it being free.

B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Spanning many decades and centuries, this planet has been blessed to experience many creative, and thought-provoking, artists.<br /><br /> Putting aside the unmitigated support and critical acclaim this band, and its latest album, No More Hell to Pay, has already received, please ask yourself a meaningful question in this age of seemingly unparalleled political and economic despair and degradation.<br /><br /> When has a group of musical artists reached deep into your soul with their searing lyrics while simultaneously taking you on a rock and roll tour de force, in a manner that transcends the rampant, global disillusionment?<br /><br /> If the answer is, &#34;[W]ell, never,&#34; that is not surprising, and also precisely why this missive is being offered, as the spiritual nature of each of us is often ignored, or even mocked, by some in the so-called popular culture that rest on forlorn, and failed, ideals glibly promoting, &#34;me, me, me,&#34; to the detriment, or in lieu, of others.<br /><br /> From the opening licks of &#34;Revelation,&#34; to the closing bell in the eloquent &#34;Renewed,&#34; Stryper has, like the mythological Phoenix, been reborn, literally and figuratively, to reveal to yet another generation the glorious joy the salvation of one's life/spirit brings to our nation and, by extension, our amazingly wondrous, and complex, world.<br /><br /> Please let your mind and soul partake of Stryper's No More Hell to Pay, and be inspired to share with others how you and yours have been touched.<br /><br /> On behalf of all searching for truth and meaning in this incredible journey we call life, thanks to the band, Michael, Robert, Oz and Tim, for sharing with the rest of us your heart, mind and soul, individually and collectively, through your artistry, spanning three glorious decades!<br /><br /> God Bless all, and may the Holy Spirit afford you devoted peace.<br /><br /> VP, the &#34;OC/LA Barrister&#34;<br /><br /> P.S. The essence of biblical faith,for those who have not yet relished in all that this life, and the next, will ultimately offer, can be discerned by googling, and reading, John 3:16 (&#34;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.&#34;) You are welcome to initiate your ascent into a life of unending, &#34;Ode to Joy,&#34; with John 3:16 as your proverbial starting gate.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was an amazing book. It had a bunch of things about world war 2 and I like how they were right in the middle of the war. Lots of bad words but they were mostly in German(it was worth it).

B00F2NOPFG|5.0|Great movie. Glad to add it to my collection. Only the best make the cut<br />Toy was an added bonus
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm a late comer to the Downton Abbey fan craze. I started watching it on PBS.com, and knew I had to buy Season 3. Can't wait for Season 4. Good quality, but I suppose that has a lot more to do with my internet connection than the download.

B00FOU1O3S|5.0|Oh my goodness. It's been forever since I've played this game and  I honestly think besides frogger and the sims that it's the best computer game.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I watched serenity about 20 times before finally breaking down and watching the complete Firefly series (14 episodes, 2002-2003). You can see my Serenity review for more details on the movie.<br /><br />This series has all my favorite characters from the movie. The series was of course made before the movie. The series has most of the same characters and loosely the same base story. I can see where the series closed down too soon.<br /><br />Some space ship, some cowboy, and a lot of people to people situation interaction. Each episode brings in a new problem and we see how our characters are to solve the problem or at least leave us with the thought of what we would do if we were there.<br /><br />I saw the complete series on Blu-ray DVD as I wanted more control over the display and repeated viewing without having to subscribe to a service. The extras were disanointing and there was no voiceover commentary. Some of the scenes ware a tad grainy; however this does not distract from the presentation.
B000THKAR2|4.0|I first got interested in the Misfits from the Metallica covers of their songs.  This is a great collection of their earlier songs.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Enjoyable read, something of a new twist on old stories without just rewriting what has been written before. I will read another in the series.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Great album. Anything less than 5 stars is just wrong. I don't even listen to Rap but usually get Eminem's albums. Buy it, won't be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|excellent game that I also play on facebook. Only problem is having to buy boosters . I stay on one level a long time.

B000000XB9|5.0|Who doesn't love Creedence Clearwater Revival?  Great tunes and memories.  The CD sure sounded better than the scratched vinyl I had.  Good  times remembered.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|This is the best western that I  have ever seen. The acting and quality of production are excellent. I have always had an interest in history and  biography and particularly the individuals and events portrayed in this movie.  I found in both cases they are probably as accurate as anyone could recreate them who was not there and part of that era. I thoroughly enjoyed it  and highly recommend it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It has simplified viewing my mail on kindle tremendously. I had all kinds of problems with my mail on kindle, especially when the time changes. (It doesn't here in Arizona.) Much easier now.
0316174483|5.0|The kids love to color and make designs. This has several designs and they laugh every-time they look at this book.
B001R10BMS|5.0|This is one of my favorite James Bond films, a stylish and mature take on the character that grows on me with each viewing. Sean Connery, who had quit playing James Bond for the second time after completing his sixth film &#34;Diamonds Are Forever&#34; in 1971, returns here 12 years later for one last fling at the role in a loose remake of his own &#34;Thunderball&#34; (1965) under a different production company. This 1983 film opened in the same year that Roger Moore played James Bond in &#34;Octopussy,&#34; doing comparable box office. One only needs to watch these two films side-by-side to see the difference between Connery and everyone else. Unlike later incarnations of James Bond, Connery plays Bond with the perfect mixture of stylish detachment and seriousness, being neither buffoonish like Moore and Pierce Brosnan nor too serious like Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig. If you've never watched Connery's Bond films, you're missing out.  Connery always liked &#34;From Russia With Love&#34; (the second Bond film) best and despised the adolescent emphasis on gadgets and jokes that he felt overwhelmed his character by the time of &#34;You Only Live Twice&#34; (1967) and &#34;Diamonds.&#34; This 1983 film is his effort to &#34;do it right again&#34; one last time, bringing Bond back to the character-driven basics of the first two movies. Here he overcomes the film's downscale sensibility (so very different from what later Bond films became) with a great performance that makes this film (in my opinion) one of the best Bond movies, if not the best in the whole series. Like &#34;Dr. No&#34; and &#34;Russia,&#34; there is very little adolescent humor here, as Connery plays an aging spy called back into action one last time with self-deprecating flair. This Bond knows he is old, but intends to live his life to the fullest, and it's a pleasure to see a film that lets Bond get older after suffering through so many other stars (especially Roger Moore) who refused to let the character age or develop. And to put it bluntly, Connery is simply a better actor than everyone else who has tackled this role, which shows in his keen grasp of the human core of a character who seems on paper little different from the psychotic assassins he battles.   In this film Connery also gets excellent nemeses in Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max von Sydow, and Barbara Carrerra. Kim Basinger, Rowan Atkinson, Bernie Casey, Edward Fox, Ronald Pickup, Gavin O'Herlihy, and Alec McCowan make likable allies. These are easily some of the best actors to do James Bond, if not the best cast ever assembled for this material, but they also (with the exception of Carrerra, whose fun scenery-chewing stops just short of being too much) do it with realism under the sure hand of &#34;Empire Strikes Back&#34; director Irvin Kirchner. If your taste runs to the more adolescent and outlandish Bonds, you will probably not enjoy this film's jazz riff on an aging hero, but you'll love it if you're a fan of the original Connery films -- which, by the way, are simply better movies than almost everything that's followed. That's why the newer Bonds keep rehashing the originals.  Other than the prestige picture-feeling of &#34;Skyfall,&#34; &#34;Never&#34; is a cut above most James Bond productions in the quality department. From the director and technical crew to the cast, everything about it has a class that exceeds the EON Bond films. The characterizations are nuanced and complex, the humor organic to the plot rather than forced, and the gadgets in service of the story rather than dominating it. Most importantly it provides a classy &#34;farewell film&#34; for Sean Connery, who plays here an aging spy called out of retirement to battle evil one last time. Not only is it a better sendoff movie for Connery than the fun lunacy of &#34;Diamonds,&#34; but it's really the only proper sendoff movie that any Bond actor has ever received, even daring to let Bond retire(!) at the end. Other than the over-the-top Fatima Blush and a few brief but effective action scenes, the film resolutely avoids the cartoonish elements and over-the top FX of other Bond films, returning the series to its starting point as it sends off its original star with class.   Some viewers complain that this movie feels too much like &#34;Thunderball&#34; at times, but I really didn't notice it beyond &#34;Largo&#34; and &#34;Domino&#34; coming back. After all, *every* Bond movie follows a formula that recycles certain situations, feeling vaguely like prior films. (In one Daniel Craig film, they actually dip a girl in oil and lay her out just like a similar unlucky girl in &#34;Goldfinger,&#34; and &#34;Die Another Day&#34; is just a long assembly of greatest hits.) On the other hand, &#34;Never&#34; works so hard to create its own personality within the basic plot framework of &#34;Thunderball&#34; that it feels incredibly fresh, showing us new things like the tango scene and video game battle which are much appreciated for daring to deviate from the old pattern.   As for the continuity of this film with others, I must point out that the Bond films are so filled with continuity errors (i.e. Blofeld not recognizing Bond in &#34;On Her Majesty's Secret Service,&#34; one film after they had battled face to face as different actors) that it's impossible to watch them all straight through and feel it's quite the same series. There's also the retcon issues of Daniel Craig's films, which clearly reboot the series from the start with a new timeline. Over the years, I've realized that it's easiest to watch the Bond films by actor rather than by year, appreciating each actor's take on the character as a self-contained series unrelated to the Bond films of other actors. Watching the films by actor rather than in chronological order, it becomes clear that Connery's films (despite their ups and downs) have the best continuity and overall consistency of quality: If you watch all six of the Eon-produced Bond films and finish up with &#34;Never Say Never Again,&#34; you'll have a satisfying experience of an entirely self-contained spy film series.   After watching the Connery movies, you can decide if you want to watch Lazenby and Moore (best paired since Moore's films are the only ones which really acknowledge the existence of Lazenby's one-shot movie, even resolving its climax in the pre-credits sequence of &#34;For Your Eyes Only&#34;) and then Dalton, Brosnan, and Craig. The older I get, the less I'm inclined to watch the non-Connery films myself. Connery's stuff feels the most original; unfortunately, most Bond films after Connery feel like a copy of a copy of themselves.

B0065GC0BA|4.0|I like and loath books that make me cry. Whist it took a while to envelop me I was so invested in the characters by the end I could not help but get a little emotional. Definitely one of the better 'chick-lit' books I have read for a while.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|My kindle just downloaded new version and will not open. It would be nice to have the new version but now I have NO Facebook!!!!
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I own every Stryper CD and they are all amazing but there is nothing that compares to No More Hell To Pay. Every song has awesome guitar riffs, huge vocals and powerful lyrics. If you have not heard of Stryper before now, you will definitely become a fan after you hear this. Give it a listen. You won't be disappointed.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Seen this on Netflix and had to buy it- superb acting on all parts, interweaving of a complex story shows masterful directing and fine production values.

B00AAQRNQ8|1.0|Left click button did not work on arrival.General quality appears to be very low. Fits my larger hands ok, but certainly no better than an mx 518 and nowhere near the comfort of the RAT 7 I am still seeking to replace.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Second best iron man hopefully four is better all around good movie though Downey jr was superb in it tho
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! I remember playing it on Facebook and I'm so glad they were able to sync them both together.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|Super fun story. Interesting characters. Will look forward to reading additional books in the series!! I hope this isn't the last of Shanna and Roman.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|A novel set in 1866, written in the style of 1866, is an achievement if it's done well and I think The Luminaries is done well.  The milieu of the New Zealand gold rush is exotic for me and is very well-described.  The main characters are drawn with depth and are interesting.  Yes it's a long book but it has kept my interest; when you enjoy the book, length is a bonus.  I will confess I am not acquainted with astrology, and I'll just say that I've pretty much ignored the brief discussions of the Zodiac and constellations, and it hasn't diminished my enjoyment of the novel one bit.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|I would highly recommend this item I purchased. It was a very good price for the quality of the product.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved this book!  So different from the norm and would like to see more like it. A funny, clever, honest and in depth prospective from the male's point of view.  I couldn't put it down once I started and nearly finished it in one sitting.  I love, love, love Drew!  I can't wait to see what else Emma Chase comes up with!  Must read!
B000I9YXKG|5.0|Charming! The story of a marriage with its beginnings, ups and downs with a realistic and satisfying conclusion. Worth watching!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Wow, super fun and ADDICTING!  The only complaint is in the advance stages where you get to deal with the chocolate is a pain and frustrating.  But GREAT game!!!!  Love it
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Not King's best work. An overcooked plot (that's saying something for King), characters who behave irrationally, few scares, and an almost laughable villain make this a good idea gone wrong.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|I absolutely love the bingo and slots combination!  I use the slots to help build up my coin count.  It does, however, tend to freeze up...at least once every other time I play. I have lost coins, bingo coins, etc., that I was paying actual cash for twice. So, if I run out from now on, I just won't be able to play anymore.  It would be cheaper to remove it from my device and download new again than to pay and still not get the coins to play.  Guess I could file a complaint and Amazon would probably see I received the tokens I purchased...just haven't wanted to stop playing long enough to do that yet!  My \\"play time\\" is limited and I hate to spend it filing forms and requests than playing BINGO!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Awesome book. I recommend it to all the readers how there. Truly thought provoking. Easy read that will keep you coming back for more
B000FBFMFW|3.0|Liked the book. Liked the author. Liked the trilogy. Robin Hobb's main character is a boy who becomes a man. A very entertaining read, but bear in mind that the author, a woman, is narrating the world of a king's ruthless male assassin. I had a difficult time getting past the heavy emotional drama and hysterics the hero was immersed in. Every chapter and verse gives promise, and you begin to wonder if the story will deliver satisfaction as you whittle it down to the very last part. Still, every thread finds its ultimate part in the tapestry. Lots and lots of heartbreaking romance and unseen ironies. I think it would have been a dynamite read if the main character would have been a female, since he emotes completely like a female with all the bells and whistles that tell you this is the fair and tender sex. I would read the trilogy again but ratchet down my expectations a few clicks.
0545615402|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my best friend. She is a huge Harry Potter fan so I am so excited to give it to her for Christmas. It will complete her collection.

B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Mae started as an employee for a small town's utility office.  Suddenly she is thrust upon the scene at the Circle and is proficient, if not exceptional, at all the screen viewing (7,8,9??), all the survey taking, all the liking, frowning, commenting, linking and transparency?? All this for a &#34;normal&#34; girl within a few weeks on the job?  I found this aspect very much unbelievable and at times very annoying to read along with.. If you know anyone with the inability to look away from their screen(s), this book is a good warning.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I read straight through all 5 books of the series. I don't want it to end. I can't believe I have to wait to read the rest of this saga! I would recommend this series to absolutely everyone. It is absolutely stunning.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Disappointed in third book. Too long and no substance. Went on and on about the same and same thing over
0316204366|5.0|Another great Gladwell book!  He does it again with unique but clear and concise analysis and explanations.  I have heard and read the David and Goliath story many, many times but Gladwell takes it to a whole new level.  It makes sense!  Why didn't I think of that.  I cannot wait to finish reading it.  What's next?
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I truly enjoy it. So easy to go from one chapter to the next. But I truly enjoy having the Bible read to me that is great. You get to hear names and words pronounced correctly as we know it can be a task.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Very detailed, interesting, portrays human nature at its best and worst.  In reading his books, you become a part of the action/scene/family, etc. and relate to it.  Love all his books. It is a very nice change from the mystery/murder books.  Patricia J.

0553296981|5.0|It came extremely new and untouched.  I love the book. Anne Frank really is an inspiration from what she wrote in her diary. She describes her last days with all her thoughts and feelings and what happened during she was hiding in the secret annexe. How cautious she and her family were since the war was going on and she was a jew. How she was before she went into hiding. She said that she wanted to keep living even after her death.....well she certainly did. Beautiful book.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is a fascinating writer, with just the right amount of quirky sarcasm and humour. His characters never fail to capture my heart, and his phrases, and the images they evoke, always manage to cling to my thoughts long after the story is over. Green doesn't do light reads, and this one is poignantly, sad, but still with his trademark ability to capture life in its fulness, both good and bad.
B00F1W1SQW|4.0|I love Dream Theater and have been a long time fan. I did enjoy the concert however I don't think the mixing comes even close to the Live at Radio City Music Hall. The band is far better with Mangini than Portnoy, who used to rush thru a few parts of some songs and I have to say the back up vocals of Petrucci are so much smoother compared to Portnoy's. However, I think James LaBrie really needs to find a new style of singing for his voice. He could still it the high notes if he'd only try some cleaner vocals instead of yelling. The other 4 guys are just out of this world...I just wish Labrie would not try SO hard and relax, it would all sound much better.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Veronica Roth has done an amazing job with this series, building an interesting futuristic dystopia with exciting plot lines, but it's her ability to create realistic characters that really shines. SPOILER*** I like the route she took of the unexpected ending, but I hate finishing a book and feeling depressed, which I did.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is one of the most intriguing books I've ever read. The subject is Jesus of Nazareth, who is quite different from Jesus the Christ.<br /><br />The writer, Reza Aslan, gives a very clear picture of the context of Jesus' life in first century Israel.  Israel at this time is made up of various regions, which the Romans dubbed &#34;Palestine.&#34; In Roman Palestine, there were two differs groups of people; those who went along with Roman rule of their country, and those who wanted the Romans out. Those two groups were quite different. The ruling class, who cooperated with the Romans, were corrupt. They stood by while the small farmers lost their lands to wealthy landowners. Indeed, whilst reading this book I kept thinking of modern America and how we have two distinct groups; those who go along with the ruling class and those who wish to return America to its Founder's principles and the Constitution. Except we don't have invaders into our nation, though we can say our invaders are ideas that are foreign to the concept of America. But I digress.<br /><br />This book is very well researched. As I write on historical and mythological subjects, what Aslan had to say about Jesus rang true. I have researched the Romans, and they did not fool around in their conquering of the Mediterranean countries. Romans had rules. Disobey their rules, and too bad for you. Their punishment was swift and deadly. The Jewish ruling class of Palestine understood this only too well, so they went along with the program so that they could prosper and keep their status. Jesus of Nazareth was not the first messiah to come along to try and upset this apple cart. He belonged to that second group of Jews who wanted the Romans out. There were many of these zealots for the old time religion, which is the pure form of Judaism. Meaning no foreigners on the land that their god gave them. The zealots wanted Rome out of Israel, and the messiahs were supposed to be the kings who would raise an army to throw out the invaders. Jesus of Nazareth was one of the zealots. The Romans, however, who had those rules, one of which was not to proclaim oneself king and suggest the Romans should go home, these are the folks who arrested Jesus and crucified him. The Jewish ruling class complained about Jesus, but they had no power to do anything about him. Only the Romans could.<br /><br />Jesus of Nazareth knew that he would be put to death for his ideas. What were those ideas? That Jews needed to get back to their founding principles. That Jews needed to care for themselves. Jesus' speeches on poverty were all about this idea of those Jews who prospered were not to prosper at the expense of their fellow Jews. Their land was for all of God's chosen, not for any foreigners and not to be exploited by the rich. Jews were supposed to be on the exclusive side, but not as something that excluded because of wealth but of breeding. It is a DNA thing, a group thing. Those within the group are supposed to behave in a certain way. Zealots wanted Jews to act like Jews, not like Romans. They wanted Jews to follow their religious laws and teachings, ideas that were for all Jews, not just the wealthy. The wealthy, however, acted like most wealthy people; they are more global in their approach to life. They enjoy what the world has to offer. They forget to take care of the poor.<br /><br />The second half of the book covers the transition of how Jesus of Nazareth, revolutionary, became Jesus Christ, king of heaven. Here Aslan agrees with the theory Elaine Pagels puts out in her book on Revelation; that early Christianity distanced itself from the Jews because Jewish Palestine was nearly wiped off the face of the earth because of the zealots. Jesus had to lose his Jewishness. As Christianity prospered, as it became a Roman religion, the blame for the death of Jesus had to be transferred to the Jews. Aslan explains this transition very well.<br /><br />This book gives the reader much to think about. I am still thinking about it. If you are a person who enjoys thinking for yourself, you will enjoy this book. If you like history, you will like this book. If you love Jesus Christ, you will love Jesus of Nazareth even more. He was a guy with true grit.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I'm a transcriptionist who really needs to have quality headphones when transcribing, and these definitely do the trick.  The sound quality is great.  Don't have a clue as to how they sound as far as listening to music, but they work great for what I need them for.  Will definitely order them again.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|This is a must reading for teachers and parents.  It suggests we challenge our kids but not necessarily try to imitate other culture's educational practices.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|It is an amazing album, strong and melodic, awesome as always Alter Bridge music. And it´snt just the music, even the lyrics are great song by song
140006922X|4.0|This was an interesting, fast-paced, and enjoyable read.  Although I question some of the author's conclusions about Jesus of Nazareth, I think the book is well worth reading.  It's as much--if not more--a history of 1st Century Palestine and the tensions between the Romans and the Jews, and between various classes and sects of Jews, as it is a biography of the historical Jesus of Nazareth.  I suspect that much of the internal conflict between Jewish sects and political/economic classes, as well as the internal conflicts in the early Christian community, are overly simplified.  But it's a good introduction to the time period and major political/religious/philosophical movements.<br /><br />Aslan's premise--that Jesus of Nazareth did not conceive of himself as God-made-flesh and advocated the overthrow of the Roman order and the Jewish classes collaborating with it, is partially persuasive.  He makes a strong case for the apocalyptic and militant fervor of the times, and it is certainly reasonable to posit that Jesus of Nazareth preached in the same vein as other self-proclaimed messiahs.  Aslan also makes a persuasive argument that the development of Jesus as the God of love and peace was a reaction to the trauma of the sack of Jerusalem, the destruction of the second Temple, and the subjugation of the Jews by Titus.<br /><br />But Aslan's locating of Jesus as one of a number of militant messiahs also highlighted the main weakness of his central premise (at least for me).  If Jesus of Nazareth was like the other preachers/messiahs, why did his ministry endure beyond his death?  What was so compelling about it that not only his followers remained faithful but that they were able to convert others who never knew Jesus?  Aslan doesn't provide an answer to that question.<br /><br />Still, this is an engaging and thought-provoking book, and it's gotten me interested in reading more about that time period.

B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I picked up this album because I was a big fan back in the, &#34;To Hell With the Devil Days.&#34; These guys stood their ground by producing a legitimate Christian Metal album that equaled their secular piers. Well, they did it again, over 30 years latter, but they really out did their selves this time. Talk about replay value, the metal is well done and the vocals are so rich! The songs, &#34;No more Hell to pay&#34; and &#34;Sympathy&#34; hooked me right away, but it doesn't stop there. Honestly, I haven't hear a bad song yet. Lets put it this way, I didn't know how much I missed Metal, until I listened to this album. The material is fresh and new, but they stayed true to their roots. This is defiantly a Stryper album! Even if you are not religious, there is something here for everyone, which was always one of their strong point--wholesome lyrics, with something powerful and significant to convey to the listener. Speaking of powerful, don't miss the song, &#34;Jesus is just alright.&#34; Wow, talk about a Metal ballad!

1476727651|5.0|I used to voraciously read everything Stephen King wrote but  then he started churning out books so quickly -  I could not keep up, so I slipped away. I have come back and this was an amazing reunion. Dr. Sleep is probably one of his best. I read it on my Kindle - which is a new experience  with being able to see which lines others are highlighting. Very cool!<br /><br />I think there was a lot of Stephen King's personal experience with addiction and sobriety in this novel that really elevated it to a different level. I enjoyed it immensely - a definite must read.

031623480X|5.0|OMG!!!  I cannot believe it!!!  OMG!!!  So as of January 2013 I weighed in at an all-time high..., for me.  I got the book The Plan and dropped a large part of the stubborn weight I so needed to lose.  I couldn't believe that The Plan diet remotely helped me but it did.  However, I plateaued on The Plan and try as I may have, I could not get those last few fat pounds off.  I’ve been “Grrrrrrr!” Still, it was my saving grace when I would start gaining again.  So along comes Grain Brain.  As an older, but good lookin woman, I was interested in this book as of course I want to stay healthy as I get older.  I read the book and it completely made sense to me.  I was a little skeptical of his encouragement toward eating more, healthy, fats  - as to me 'fat is fat makes ya fat'!  But I said &#34;what the hay&#34; and have been trying it anyway and 'LO AND BEHOLD' I'm dropping the weight I'd been struggling with since The Plan.  Amazing!  You should see me today.  These jeans I'm wearing need a belt for real!  I'm swimmin in these pants!  I can't believe how eating more fat is actually making me lose weight.  You should see the amount of food with fat it in that I eat!  It's crazy but the weight is just apparently coming off.  I'll be bloqging about this at my afreemejoy bloq.  I'm in awe of this concept.

B00EEPFRGE|5.0|'No More Hell To Pay' surprised me, big time! I read online where Michael Sweet claimed it was their best album to date, and to be honest, I never take that seriously. Every artist says that about their upcoming releases. However, Mr. Sweet was not blowing smoke. This album is chock full of great songs. These songs contain everything you hope to hear from these guys...blistering guitar work, excellent vocals, and a top notch rhythm section.<br /><br />There is just enough variety in the songs to keep things very interesting, but they're all really good songs. I really don't think there is any filler material on this cd. The album flows just as it should. There are moments that seem epic, moments that seem thrash-like, and moments that just seem like feel good rock n roll. Not only that, but the production/mix is top notch as well.<br /><br />I grew up as a fan of Stryper, but was a bit disappointed with their newer material, because it seemed such a departure from the past. On this album, they seem to have embraced who they are as a band and what they are known for. At the same time, it doesn't seem dated at all. I look forward to many hours of listening pleasure with 'No More Hell To Pay'. So far, every time I listen I pick a different song as my favorite. Truth is, the whole thing rules! If you like music that rocks hard, trust me....don't pass this up!

1455523550|5.0|I watched the movie recently. It's about a girl running from her past. As the movie unfolds there is a lot of suspense. the heroine is running from her police husband who is obsessed with her. Violent he drove her to heights of fear in their home. Enter a mystery friend who watches over her while she finds a new life and love--with a handsome widower. For me the end was a bit shocking. Josh Duhamel and Julianna Hough give a splendid performance. What a delightful movie. With that said, I would recommend the book.

0345803485|3.0|It would serve no purpose to rehash the plot of the book. However, I would like to make a few points about  it.<br /><br />First, the sado/masochistic  contract between Christian Grey and Anastasia is not as unusual as some reviewers think. Similar contracts can be found on the Internet.  These documents serve no legal purpose  (Christian's comment that his lawyer insists on it is ludicrous) but they reinforce the dom/sub relationship.<br /><br />Second, as a broad generalization, usually very powerful people (like Grey) are secret submissives rather than doms. Their submissiveness  serves as a \\"relaxation\\" from their onerous duties.  For example, a number of ministers of the United Kingdom government,  certainly powerful men, have lost their positions because it was discovered that they had paid prostitutes to  . . .  spank them.<br /><br />Third, some people (men and women) are masochists who are not even aware of their condition. For instance, women who marry  abusive men, divorce them, and remarry a similar characters.  Or  men who manage constantly to lose their jobs in spite of  their capabilities. On the other hand, there are overt masochists who seek out their abusers and vice versa. It is relatively rare for a woman like Anastasia, with no masochistic tendencies, to fall for an out-and-out sadist, in spite of his stunning looks and intellect. (A number or reviewers have commented that how Grey acquired his great wealth or his perfect musical abilities is not adequately explained). It is clear from the plot that Anastasia is not trying the sub routine for Grey's enormous wealth. Then why is she willing to put up with Grey's outlandish demands?<br /><br />What the plot lacks is psychological insight into Anastasia and a coherent explanation of Christian Grey's psychological development. That he was a sub as a teenager to a  much older woman, and enjoyed that role, does not explain how he became a dom to women his own age.

B008JFUS0U|4.0|Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) slowly but surely gained momentum over the course of five films, eventually culminating with 2012’s summer blockbuster, Marvel’s The Avengers.  After creating arguably the greatest super hero film ever, the question quickly becomes, how do you top that?  Sequels are typically inferior films, but when it comes to the MCU, they simply keep getting better – at least in terms of financial earnings.  While not a direct sequel to The Avengers, Iron Man 3 performed well at the box office (highest grossing film of 2013), telling its own solo story but still picking up the subtle pieces in the aftermath of the Battle of New York.  Iron Man 3 also jump started Phase Two of the MCU, which will reach its conclusion in the summer of 2015 with the already highly anticipated Marvel’s The Avengers: Age of Ulton.  Until then, we are left with the television drama, Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.D., along with several more solo adventures including Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the next chapter of Phase Two, Thor: The Dark World.<br /><br />Alan Taylor (HBO’s Game of Thrones & The Sopranos) directs the comic book sequel, Thor: The Dark World, starring Chris Hemsworth as Thor, the God of Thunder.  In the aftermath of the Battle of New York, Thor has embarked on a mission to bring peace to the nine realms.  With his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), safely in custody and peace on the horizon, Thor yearns to see Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) – despite his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), advising against it.  At the same time, a thought-to-be extinct race, called the Dark Elves, hatch a plan to attack Asgard and enact their revenge for the supposed annihilation of their race.  Stellan Skarsgård, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, and Rene Russo also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />About the only drawback of this Thor sequel is that it parallel’s the first film far too much for comfort.  Both films begin with Thor at a crossroads in his life.  In the first film, he was all about ego, and now, he’s all about Jane Foster.  Thor’s father, Odin, is still reluctant to put his son on the throne, causing a great deal of tension before the two.  Loki’s character is also more of the same, mirroring his actions in both Thor and The Avengers.  To be honest, he’s mostly still a nuisance – causing more problems than he’s worth.  In a mostly humorous turn of events for Loki, it turns out that treason against the Asgardians is grounds for death (which will be discussed as the film goes along), yet launching a major alien invasion against Earth garners nothing more than lifetime imprisonment.  Sure, that’s awfully convenient, but it’s a welcomed ruling, especially since Tom Hiddleston has established himself as a nearly indispensable marketing commodity in the MCU.<br /><br />The acting quality of this cast is, like the first film, top-notch.  Chris Hemsworth leads the way as the main protagonist, proving that he is worthy of his initial casting as the God of Thunder.  Like Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, it’s nearly impossible to imagine any other actor as Thor.  Hemsworth is certainly attractive enough, not to mention ripped as all get out, making him both perfect for this role physically and mentally.  His co-star, Natalie Portman, returns as his love interest, Jane Foster.  And, regardless of what the synopsis above states, Jane Foster is the pivotal character in this story – so much so that she nearly overshadows Thor.  Portman is one of the few Hollywood’s A-list actresses that will shine no matter what the role may be, and it will quickly become apparent in this film that she would have been far more suited to play a pivotal character, like Ms. Marvel or the Invisible Woman, instead of a limited supporting character like Jane Foster.<br /><br />As far as the supporting cast goes, there aren’t enough adjectives in the dictionary to complement their brilliance.  Tom Hiddleston has established himself superbly as the villainous, untrustworthy God of Mischief, Loki.  At this point, he’s clearly benefited from his flawless portrayal of this character (in his third stint) since the writers have obviously gone out of their way to keep incorporating his character in multiple storylines. Once again returning alongside Hiddleston is Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Honestly, what more could anyone possibly say about the powerful Sir Anthony that hasn’t already been said?  The same goes for his onscreen wife, Rene Russo, who is the focal point of the film’s most powerful scene in her role as Thor’s mother and the Queen of Asgard, Frigga.  Rounding out the noteworthy supporting cast is CBS’ new comedy star, Kat Dennings, who along with Stellan Skarsgård, provides the film’s most humorous moments.  And, last but not least is Jaimie Alexander – returning to her role as Thor’s other potential love interest, Sir.  Keep an eye of Alexander, folks.  She has the potential to be Hollywood’s next big thing.<br /><br />Sadly, the main villain of this sequel is no better than the villain of the first film – and obviously you can’t have Loki doing the major dirty work in every film.  This is also one more characteristic that mirrors the plot of the first film.  Christopher Eccleston portrays Malekith, another one-dimensional bad guy from Thor’s weak rogues’ gallery.  Like Colm Feore’s portrayal as Laufey in the first film, both Malekith and Laufey are vengeful, depth-lacking characters that never, at any point, truly pose a substantial risk – even in spite of this film’s tragedy.  Tragedy has become a regular occurrence, with the death of Bucky Barnes in Captain America: The First Avenger (and there’s no need to spoil his future endeavors) and Agent Coulson in Marvel’s The Avengers.  Regardless, Malekith is such a poorly established, insignificant villain that finding a real test for Thor in future sequels will be one of the few areas that needs to be addressed.<br /><br />Overall, Thor: The Dark Ones is a welcomed addition to the MCU, even with its noticeable flaws and resemblance to the first film.  The action and super hero drama is endless, not to mention quite epic. Like the majority of comic book films, there’s a little something for everyone in this film – including romance.  Don’t misunderstand – this is one of the most enjoyable and entertaining films of the year.  However, if there is one significant drawback to this film, it’s the fact that there’s nothing monumental that occurs to change the landscape of the MCU.  This sequel is by no means a game changer, but it does set up the next chapter of Phase Two, Guardians of the Galaxy.  With that being said – don’t you dare leave your seat until all those credits have passed.  You’ll be kicking yourself if you do.  Enjoy.<br /><br />GRADE:  B-<br />FNDNreview.com<br /><br />P.S. – keep your eyes open for a cameo from both Stan Lee and a “glimpse” of one of Thor’s fellow Avengers.tives in the dictionary to complement their brilliance.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Choices of image, complexity, pieces displayed all combine to make this app a quintessential puzzle, especially for those who do not have the space for a puzzle layout.  This app also serves as a great too for entertaining, especially for those long waits before boarding and while on long trips.  The only disadvantage is the limited complexity available, which is why I gave it a four-star rating.
B003G4W49C|3.0|For all the hype of what this book it i was a little let down.  Its an overall fun read and maybe the movie will be good, but there are others i have liked more
1449325947|4.0|Excellent CSS info and tutorials, but a bunch of typos and a couple of technical mistakes prevent me from giving it five stars. If you get it, you should check out the book's errata web pages.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|If you havent read any of Ruiz Zafon books then i suggest you start.  I have enjoyed a lot of his titles and all i can say is i am impressed with each one.

Now, though, it came down to half the price.  That kinda drop weirds me out.  I mean, 20% off is a great deal.  80% off kinda worries me.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|Seriously! This Harry Potter after all, what would there be not like? This would make a wonderful weekend marathon affair where each participant would be muggle-born but magically inspired. But even if viewed separately, it enhances the book versions so well you could easily find yourself looking for the Leaky Cauldron and Platform Nine and Three Quarters.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|It's like a cool mix between strategic and action based structure! With every win you get you want more! Also it has a cool upgrade system that allows you to get cool upgrades for towers!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Love Spider. A better challenge than the regular solitaire game. I use the two deck game for a real challenge.  .
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Using his own research and that of many others, Reza Asian has put into one comprehensive book, an easy-to-read, fascinating account of the early Christian era. It is a great service to anyone with the slightest interest about the life and times of Jesus. But be warned, if you are a Biblical literalist, you may find the the book disturbing. However, for me, and I think for many of us, it  deepens and strengthens Christian understanding and faith.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A real challenge, can be very addictive. Phone app has a problem with the extra moves feature. You have to uninstall and re-install it get it to work for a few times, then it stops again.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Because i like it now how do i invite people to play and give me lives. i also think its awesome.
B00BAXFAJC|4.0|Good read but I found the ending too abrupt and disappointing, which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I like the puzzles but there is way too much useless dialog.  Also the characters are too smartalecky for me.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|Amazing 5th season. The first episodes gave me the feeling of the original films. I had an emotional reaction to such nostalgia, it was great. The Finale of the season is probably one of the best of the entire series. Applause to the whole team.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Not the finest piece of writing, but very intriguing read.  So much honor is due to these guys who are &#34; just doing the job &#34;!  Fascinating details.  I am in awe of our American Heros.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So glad I can now play on my Kindle!  Really wish it wasn't so addictive because I stay up way too late.  Levels are challenging but fun.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Isn't it entirely possible that those big Winnebagos you see traveling down the interstate in packs are driven by a roving band of vampire-like gypsies called the True Knot? And this band is led by an ancient and soulless creature named Rose the Hat? I am one of those (rare I'm sure) King fans who did not read The Shining before I read Doctor Sleep, but I am here to tell you, this book stands all on its own. It reminds me a little of The Talisman, in that the genuine affection King has for the main characters shines through, and the world he creates is detailed and so very...believable. I sometimes wonder when I read a King book if there is something he knows that the rest of us don't. Doctor Sleep is in my top three King books, along with The Stand and The Talisman (which he wrote with Peter Straub). Thank you Mr. King for another great read. I lost sleep these past few days, but it was so worth it!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I watched the movie real steel.This is better but I like the movie too.There is so much robots you can make.LOVE IT!
B00ARF92HK|3.0|Not really a very good movie but if you are looking for a movie with a lot of blood & guts and killing then you should watch this.

B005P1YCNK|4.0|Good read. Very down to earth and to the point. Excited to incorporate its teachings. Now to implement it and get to work.
B00G32OER4|4.0|As far as movies go, I thought it was a good show.  I thought it was well acted and filmed.  I thought some of the timing was Killer!!!  (There were a couple of scenes that made me jump!).  As far as a \\"Movie\\" goes, good job.  But the theology was not correct at all.  When push came to shove (maybe that's a pun...being a Ghost story)...  they were all patting themselves on the back, \\"Look what 'WE' did!\\"  \\"We really showed those evil spirits whose boss!\\"  \\"WE really know the right 'Pass Word' with God\\"  (wink wink).  They are passing this movie off as true.  Lemme tell you;  God is not someone you pull out of a box at the right time to kick the bad guys butt and put him away.  That's how the movie felt to me.  Outside of the Lord NOTHING GOOD is gonna happen.  I'm sorry for sounding 'preachy', it's just, if the story is 'true'...those people could still be in a lot of danger.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Why the rating?  Time Warp, Great Scott, Fankenfurter, Eddie, Columbia, Riff Raff, Brad, Janet, the Zen room...it goes on and on.  Music is brilliant, and the story twisted.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Kind of addictive after a few minutes! Looked like a kids game, but it's pretty entertaining... Especially if u try to meet the goals for each level.

B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Best album from anyone ive heard in a long time, ive missed Em and hes back now. Love you em
B0056369RO|5.0|Party Rocking...enough said. These songs have been around for a few years now but they are the kind of songs that will be played 20 years from now because &#34;Every day I'm shuffling.&#34; :)
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Very well written book. I would recommend to any Patriot. Gives a feel good feeling that people can overcome huge obstacles to become the person they want to be. Uplifting story of courage.
B00800WIK2|2.0|I needed it for an iphone 5 ...it on fit an iphone 4. I will be returning. This product was &#34;made for iphone&#34; according to the brief information I read off of the page I purchased it from. If this product is avail in an iphone 5, I would like to swap it out.

B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I find the dialog very entertaining as well as the short stories while connecting the running screenplay.  I want to be just like Harvey Specter
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I loved this movie. It is funny, sweet, romantic and Jude Law is adorable. I have probably watched it ten times.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Becoming reacquainted with Danny Torrance is a pleasure that kept me entertained and intrigued.  Thanks Mr. King, for revisiting a character I've always loved.

B004GJDQT8|3.0|barcode scanner needs work I tried scanning a can of Wired energy drink and came up with some kids games other things I tried scanning it wouldn't recognize it all it's the worst one I've used
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This app was great in the beginning but wouldn't load after a while. Really disappointed with this.  But I guess u could get it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|THIS APP IS VERY GLITCHY NOW IT DOESN'T SHOW THE NAME OF THE DOWNLOAD FOLDER OR FILE UNLESS YOU FIGURE OUT TO ONLY SEE IT FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS OR UNTILL YOU OPEN UP ANOTHER FOLDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006YC74E8|4.0|Nice to have an &#34;on board&#34; (on cell phone) app to touch up photos.<br />IT IS NOT GIMP quality, but is handy for simple things.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Never read a better series in my life. It was incomparable to any other series of books. A great read!
B00433SVP6|5.0|This is an excellent book. The story is excellent and the plot and characters are great. Must read for anyone likes to read fantasy books. Stupendous !!!!!
B000003N8G|1.0|Charlie Haden, Ornette Colman, Don Cherry-- well, I respect these guys for what they bring to the medium and what they risk by doing it. But I just don't like it very much.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The kids and I love this app. I like the fact they can care for a horse and I don't have to buy a real 1!!!!!!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addicting! Once you start you can't stop. Every person should have this game. IT'S FINALLY ON KINDLE FIRE!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Always loved the show from the beginning. It keeps growing, the story-line and the characters. You stay on edge wondering what's going to happen, and it's unpredictable. The show isn't afraid to do something drastic!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book seemed to have more thinking and didn't move as quickly.<br />The characters were more human...multidimensional.<br />I was surprised a few times.<br />If a person ever wondered about PTSD this book certainly makes it real , believable, understandable.<br />Life in 13 didn't seem that different then other districts.  There was as much oppression, and hunger.  For the most part the differences between Capitol and Rebel were minimal. I wonder what happens to the country after the narrative ends.<br />I like the end.  I like how music helps heal.  I like how the characters in the end really see each other, warts PTSD, burns and all, and still choose to LIVE .  This contrasts to the rest of the 3 books where people were constantly being created...made into something they weren't.
B000005AYL|5.0|This album works perfectly and I am jammin' to it everyday! Erykah Badu has an amazing voice and I miss her performances.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enders game was a good book. It was a great way to show how children are forgiven more than adults are because Ender killed 1 billion buggers and the repopulating buggers forgave him because he was a child and children make mistakes.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It only works with YouTube or Netflix. I was expecting to could see my favourite videos from the tablet to the TV, but Netflix is not enough. Even though the product works perfectly.
B00B3YDOGO|4.0|Excellent set of books. Hard to put down. Gillian Flynn has a fine imagination and writes about very dark female characters which is a new twist for thrillers
B00C7607BC|5.0|Another great Disney movie to share with the next generation! Although I wish they could've made the bluray version better quality...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore is proving its usefulness time and again. The convenience and time saving that it offers is significant to me in that I make notes once &amp; they are available on all my devices in almost real time. Duplication of effort is eliminated.<br /><br />when you use it; you will understand what I mean. There are also great tutorials to teach you how to make this tool even more useful. Don't take my word for it. use it yourself.

I was expecting more for the price I paid.  And while Mr. Young is an excellent wordsmith, I find his writing style a bit too folksey and mildly irritating for my tastes.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I thought I would be thrilled with this, however do your research as to what it actually can do, and what it can not do.<br />I am disappointed. Even though the price is relatively low, I would rather pay more to get more. Sony, WD, Roku, all have similar devices , but not exactly. Please, before buying , do check out what this unit is capable of and specifically what it is not intended to do.
B005D0RDKC|4.0|The third volume in the Johnny Cash &#34;bootleg&#34; series features live recordings.  The songs were recorded at ten different concerts over a span of 23 years and vary widely in sound quality.  Some of the shows were professionally recorded and some sound like they were taped by an audience member who snuck a tape recorder into the concert.<br /><br />We start with a brief three song set from Dallas in 1956 at the start of Johnny's career.  Sound quality is pretty good for such an old live recording.<br /><br />Next is a complete show from 1962 in Maryland.  This is not a professional recording but it sounds decent.<br /><br />Next up is Cash's complete performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964.  This is a professional recording in stereo.  This also is the third time that Johnny sings &#34;I Walk the Line&#34; in the CD.  A highlight is &#34;Don't Think Twice, It's All Right&#34; played at the request of Bob Dylan.<br /><br />Disc one concludes with a peformance for the troops in Vietnam in 1969.  The sound quality is not too good, with the rowdy crowd drowning out the music at times.  I suspect that the tape ran out before the concert ended, because the CD quickly fades out right after the last song.  Cash performed this show with pneumonia, by the way.  He later wrote and recorded a song about this tour called &#34;Singing in Vietnam Talking Blues&#34;.<br /><br />Disc two open with the last complete concert featured here, that being a performance at The White House in 1970.  This is a professional stereo recording.  This is a unique show, with Cash only singing songs about life in America and spiritual songs (with the exception of his recent hit &#34;A Boy Named Sue&#34;).<br /><br />Then we get three songs recorded at a Swedish prison in 1972.  This concert was previously released on LP.  Only three songs from the concert are on this CD, those being ones that he rarely performed live.<br /><br />Then there is one song from the CBS Records Convention in 1973.  This is a professional recording of &#34;City of New Orleans&#34;, which I had never heard Cash perform before.<br /><br />Next are two song from Virginia in 1976.  This is not a professional recording, with Cash's voice and the piano being heard and the other instruments being buried in the mix.<br /><br />Next are three songs from West Virginia later in 1976.  This is a stereo recording with the three songs being oldies from Johnny's Sun Records days.<br /><br />The CD concludes with two songs from a show in Nashville in 1979.  This is not a professional recording, but it sounds decent.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a set that serious Johnny Cash fans will enjoy, but I wouldn't recommend it to a novice fan.  Sorry if the review is too long, but I wanted to be thorough.n 1973.

B008JFUS28|5.0|Thor was a film I had wanted to see in the theater, but couldn't get anyone to watch with me. When I did finally see it on DVD, I was actually shocked how good a film it was. Deep characterization, loads of charm, and a wonderful warmth pervaded the film (in addition to some glorious eye candy). Since then a few of the Marvel films have seems to a mis-step here and there. While I enjoyed Iron Man 3, it had neither the dramatic weight of the first Iron Man, nor the pure silly fun of Iron Man 2. And the Avengers film, while also mildly enjoyable simple wasn't up to the standards of films like Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor (I won't list reasons why because my balanced review listing positives and negatives got so much negative hateful feedback I had to pull it). And thus it was that late at night I sat down for Thor:The Dark World, half expecting a deep disappointment and half hoping for a film as good as the original. What I actually saw I never could have seen coming.<br /><br />The Second Best Film of the Year<br /><br />Okay, this has been a very interesting year. Between an Andrew Niccol film (The Host), and a Joseph Kosinski visual masterpiece (Oblivion), early on it seemed like nothing could top those two movies for sheer film-making technique. Some people hated the cheesy romance of The Host and should thus avoid Hitchcock romances, and some didn't like Oblivion, because some people just hate sci-fi for whatever reason. Still.. those films were darn good. Then we got White House Down, a masterpiece of Die Hard-style popcorn throwing fun, and Pacific Rim, which is my favorite film of the year (not the best, but it feels so good to watch it has to be my favorite). And just when I thought nothing could ever top Oblivion and the year was all done, Gravity absolutely astounded me with its quality of film-making, rocketing past Oblivion to become the best film of the year. While Thor 2 (what I'll call it for short) isn't better than Gravity, it is definitely the greatest blockbuster film of the year by a long, long way. And here's why.<br /><br />Simple Technique<br /><br />Anyone who has read my other reviews for movies should know by now that I am not impressed by hype for the most part. And what other people think of a film couldn't affect my opinion less. But what does impress me is good old-fashioned film-making technique. Were the actors in-character? Was the dialog entertaining and well written? Were the special effects good (and pretty)? Was the music rousing and in-sync with the action? Was there light and color and inspiring moments? And most importantly to me, was there some gosh-darn honest-to-goodness cinematography to be found?<br /><br />Yes. Yes! Yes!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I can see someone hating this film for exactly three reasons. 1. They hate the actors. 2. They hate Thor or comic books/sci-fi/blockbusters in general. 3. They have absolutely no taste whatsoever.<br /><br />As often happens when watching movies, watching this film I was reminded of many scenes in other films. Throne-room scenes, scenes of betrayal, romantic moments, awkward moments, funeral scenes, sci-fi action scenes. You could say that these scenes were just cheap rip-offs of other TV shows, books, and movies. But saying that would make you an idiot. Because every single one of those scenes was not just well done. It was perfectly done. The dramatic scenes will hit you hard. The romantic scenes will make you smile. The awkward scenes will make you laugh. The action scenes will glue your eyes to the screen. And the many, many scenes that just add character development to the film, layers to the story, and glorious, glorious beauty to the film will draw you in, hold your attention, and leave you in simple child-like wonder.<br /><br />What great film direction looks like<br /><br />I don't want to knock Ender's Game too much (I already did that in my review) but the biggest failing of that film (which indicated poor direction to me) was that it was poorly paced, spending far too much time on insignificant details and not enough time on important ones. Characters felt shallow and scenes lacked dramatic weight as a result. Likewise, the climax of Man of Steel had no dramatic weight because when you've seen an hour and half of people blasting through buildings doing it one more time (this time with feeling!!!) for a climax leaves you with a major case of burn-out.<br /><br />Watching Thor 2, it does everything right that those films did wrong. Its pacing is perfect. It take its time when it's important, letting us catch our breath and absorb developments, and it rushes past things that don't really add weight to the story. Things which everyone knew would add more to the film (more Loki! more of the gate-keeper guardian!) were added, but actually given a reason to be there instead of just being empty fan-service. When the climax of the film does come, it's everything a film climax should be. It's filled with action, drama, wit, and hilarity. It's superbly directed, and absolutely perfect.<br /><br />A round of applause all-around<br /><br />Everyone, I and do mean everyone...who worked on this film deserves a round of applause. Every actor out-did themselves and surpassed their previous work as their beloved characters. The musical score is fantastic and the composer deserves serious props. The writers gave every character incredible dialog that fit and enhanced their persona even further (no out-of-character dialog to be found). The special effects are everything that Man of Steel and Avengers strove for and lacked, being strikingly surreal, and touchingly beautiful. And the cinematography is master class. The shot composition on this film is so good that I wholeheartedly believe it should be nominated (though I sure it won't be) alongside Gravity, Oblivion, and The Host.<br /><br />As a film-lover, what more can I say? This it the perfect comic book sci-fi sequel. See it in the theater. Buy the Blu Ray. Peace out.at it was poorly paced, spending far too much time on insignificant details and not enough time on important ones. Characters felt shallow and scenes lacked dramatic weight as a result.

B00CATSONE|1.0|By Bill Marsano. This 'book' is a waste of time. First, it isn't a book but a brief promotional brochure. Second, Tesla  figures here not so much an example of true genius (which he had) but as an example of someone who never gave up (which he didn't). But we get no insight into Tesla. Instead what we get is a lot of cheerleading self-help stuff of the \\"you can do it\\" variety--the sort of stuff that appears on inspirational wallposters designed to motivate underpaid  employees of large faceless corporations. Unless \\"There is no I in TEAM\\" is your kind of philosophy, this isn't for you. Bill Marsano is an award-winning non-fiction writer and editor.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My wife ordered this book and really enjoyed it. She stayed awake till all hours of the night reading it.
B005LAII80|4.0|I enjoyed watching this film again, I was a big fan of the comics as a youngster and this a decent adaptation. As well as that it is a decent action film. It's set in the future where most of America is an irradiated wasteland, Mega City One is a vast city housing most of the remaining population. The city is rife with crime, things are so bad that the judges are empowered as judge, jury and executioners as needed. A new drug called slow-mo (which also provides a nice reason for some of the special effects) has hit the streets and as part of this three pushers are murdered. Judge Dredd and a rookie called Anderson investigate the murders and find themselves trapped inside the block. They then have to battle their way out.<br /><br />The set up is very similar to The Raid (another excellent action film) and while the story isn't particularly unique it is sufficient to keep things interesting through the film.<br /><br />For me the real problem was the setting, it didn't really fill the fantasy created in the comics. It has glimpses of it, but for the most part is little different from a modern environment. This in part  reflects the low budget for the film.<br /><br />However it's strengths far outweigh that minor complaint. The main plus for me was Dredd himself, Karl Urban does portray the character I imagined while reading the comics. The other characters are also well played, Anderson contrasts well with Dredd as the rookie judge being assessed.<br /><br />This is a fun film, worth watching even if you don't know the comics and a fair adaptation if you have.
B003E8P9G0|1.0|Copied off Eragon read both and see. Ps Eragon came first. Seriously Rick thank me later now I'm out later.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The game was definitely fun and entertaining - however, 10 levels is certainly not long enough. Also, I encountered a few glitches and at one point the game stopped working and I had to reinstall and start all over.  I will wait for the next, longer version to be created - but at this time, won't highly recommend this game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Every episode leaves you wanting more,  definitely worth watching.  Make sure you start at the beginning so it makes sense. Love this series!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel in a way I've never seen before...very shocking performance!<br />I realized it was a great movie a few days later
B008JFUR10|5.0|Best giant robot movie ever. It's everything you hope and then more. No disappointments and actually one of the only movies I've went to the theater twice to see.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Though I really liked \\"Reborn\\" and \\"Murder By Pride\\", for the most part they lacked that energy of the earlier albums. I've been a fan of Stryper since the mid 80s and I have been waiting for that classic Stryper sound in their new material. The harmonizing solos. The high intensity vocals. The thunderous percussion that was Stryper. Well when I got \\"No More Hell To Pay\\" and put it in my player, I was 14 again. Laying on my bed, listening to the new Stryper album. It had all the makings of a THWTD sequel with a newer edge. From start to finish, this is a phenomenal record. If you buy any record in this holiday season, this is the record to buy!!
B001706I5I|4.0|So cute! Dr Seuss is a favorite in our house. Wasn't sure if it would freak my 6 and 3 year old out but they loved it  Jim Carrey did it well.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Purely Great!!!! It has everything you need in a show. It actually has a storyline which some of you don't want, but it does & makes it much more then only non stop zombies. I love zombies, but you need more then zombies to carry a show into 4 seasons.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I am a 17 year old boy with a full time job and school and usually don't have time to read books but when i saw this in my mothers kindle i was curious and i just couldn't put it down once i started reading it. I did have a hard time following dialogue at times but other then that it was perfect. I recommend this book to anyone who likes war games, war books, and anyone who just likes to think. I hope everyone has a wonderful day:)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Absolutely fantastic and very original story ! have not read SF for a while - this book has made me eager for more
B008IJT0CE|5.0|nice app for baby sleep, when it works. nice interface easy to use. I wish there is a blow dryer sound, my baby loves that. But I guess vacuum or white noise is close.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I like the size of the tracker and the fact that I can see the number of steps I've completed throughout the day.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good game, habit forming,addicting. Very well played out but some hunts are near I'm possible. It's a good chance to sharpen your edge
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|Sometimes runs choppy loading and moving through the menu on Kindle Fire(Original). Game itself is just like the others and doesn't add much overall.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Good game , awesome rewards , some ugly dragons , some pretty dragons , to many dragons cost gems . Other than that , I got nothing .
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I LOVED the first two books and I struggled through most of this book, but pushed on hoping for an awesome conclusion, only to be very very disappointed. I never write reviews, but this was such a sad sad end to what I thought was one of the best trilogies I have read in a long time. DON'T READ THIS BOOK. Stop on the second book, it will save you time, money, and a little novel heartbreak.
B009XI7RF6|4.0|The game concept is really simple - draw paint lines to connect doodles, mix colors and make sure you don't run out of paint. It seems so simple and it is, but it's also challenging and makes you think. Visuals a clean and crisp with a unique but consistent look and feel. Good audio. Recommended!
B00EDR5N58|5.0|My son LOVED it! Very cool collector's piece from the next BIG thing in music!<br />Item as described/received in good condition.<br />Thank you!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|Beautiful movie.  My daughter and I enjoyed this film, and have made it a tradition to watch every year on Thanksgiving day!
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Awesome movie.  My favorite.  Just had to have it on blu ray to add it to my collection of dvds
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I have enjoyed this series immensely. Interesting characters and plot. If you enjoy British dramas you will enjoy Downton Abbey.
B0035G5IOE|3.0|This movie is sort of creepy...  The animation is pretty cool though.  Was recommended by a friend, but would not buy again
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Enjoy the magic and brilliance of Spielberg.  One of the best 80's kids movies.  I loved it as a kid and so do my kids!
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Smaller than I thought it would be.  But should have figured out size by how big negatives look in the picture.<br />Pros: -takes great pictures of slides. Pictures look as good as the picture does in the slide<br />-easy to take pictures of slides. Just slide into slot and save.<br />-amazingly quick saving photos into unit.<br />-Uses SD card so no need to connect computer.<br />-Takes good pictures of negatives as well.<br />Cons:<br />-can be difficult to slide negatives through the slot and roller.  So many places for the slide to hook onto the machine.  Not sure why the machine is made with so many edges for the negative to hook on to.  They give you a plastic strip to help if slides hooks on.  Think design flaw.  Should have fixed issue instead of giving the strip.<br />But great unit would buy it again.  Works amazingly fast and good quality pictures.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the characters and hated to part with then when the book ended.  Also sparked my interest in the hidden meaning of flowers from the Victorian age.  Who knew that giving a peony may not be very complimentary? (anger) or that oakleaf geranium means true friendship but beware of a scarlet geranium which means stupidity...oops.  Great love story too<br /><br />It also made me want to do something for foster children
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I like the clock. But, unless I am looking at the app incorrectly ,it does not have an am or pm selection. So the 630  alarm I set will wake me when ? In the morning or  the evening ?
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Game is very fun and time cosuming. Only fault I have is that it is sometimes hard to build the rocket without fumbling around and dropping pieces all over or clicking on the wrong thing.
B000SEGMAU|3.0|It was ok. I preferred some of Mitch Alboms other books. Good book though. Teaches many life lessons. Lots to put into life.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is just so stinkin cute! It is a great way to pass the time if you are waiting somewhere and your kids(or adults) gets bored!<br /><br />My daughter loves it, she makes some pretty crazy hairstyles, and I even caught my Husband playing on it, and creating the hairstyle and facial hair that matches his own. It was pretty funny and is a must have on the kids lists.
B00005O3VD|5.0|Wanted this movie and felt the price was good. Happy with this purchase.  Good experience and thank you. Will try your site again for movies.
B00EDF43MY|4.0|I have purchased all of the Dr. Panda games for my daughter, and I don't even bother getting the free versions, as I know these will entertain her. She loves them all! She loves being able to show me that she can do everything herself and having me get involved once she is a pro!<br /><br />Okay, so here is the deal with this particular app from Dr. Panda. It is their most involved app yet, but don't let that stop you from getting it. There are  few things to know first:<br /><br />Age: I personally would not recommend this app for 3 and under and maybe some 4 year olds. My daughter is in preschool so she was learning her ABC's and 123's, and your child needs to recognize and be able to match them in order to play this one. You can still have them play it, but i think they will get frustrated because it is more advanced.<br /><br />Gameplay: This app is pretty cool, the different aspects of the airport that they can interact with are really cute. I personally like the lost and found, but the problems my daughter had came with calling on the telephone(you have to type in the number pad the numbers shown) and it was kind of difficult for her at first without just pressing everything just for fun, AND the dropping off at the gates. Each character shows what gate they want dropped off at, and you have to stop the cart at the right one.<br /><br />Overall it is an awesome game and my daughter loves it, but it is the hardest one yet, and some people who are used to the other Dr. Panda apps might get upset that this one exceeded the gameplay of the other ones.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|This Oliver Stone Obsessional is such a classic!Even if you're NOT a conspiracy buff, the over-the-top performances by such fine actors as Joe Pescci, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones and of course Kevin Costner will surely keep you entertained!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I was skeptical at first to download and let my 4 year old play this game, because I didn't know if she was old enough to understand what she needed to do. I have the lock on my Kindle Fire that stops in-app purchases, other wise she would have the biggest and greatest houses available. Make sure you have that added if you decide on this app.<br /><br />My daughter has found out that she can't get the upgrades unless she gets enough coins so it is a good game for her to play. The only reason I gave this app a 4(and was debating a 3) is that there is no way to stop kids from clicking on the banners and going to the websites that the LPS has or its affiliates. I let her play the apps and watch netflix, but I don't like that it lets her on the internet that easily. I would love to see these apps have the blocking ability as well.
B008602KQI|5.0|Good story line, actors, and special effects.  Family watching quality with moral lessons besides being entertaining.  Would recommend it for families with teens.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I've played traditional Mahjong for a long time, but now I find it kinda boring. This is a cute and interesting game.
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|My son loved playing Polar Bowler, but it repeatedly stalled.  Unfortunately, we had to delete the app and download it on our iPad instead.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. I have watched it over and over. I cannot wait for the next Avatar movie.
0792846443|5.0|This movie was not as scary as I remembered, but I intentionally watched it in the afternoon to avoid those horrid dreams after watching it the very first time.  Kathy Bates will never be the same...she adds incredible depth to this movie.
B000062X90|5.0|Bought this album when it first came out in the 70's. This is great with the extra tracks and live extra's. If you like Ash you have to get this.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Funny , witty show. great to watch with any member of family. exception for little children, they must likely wont get the quips and jokes.
B00EVPSJOE|5.0|What else can I say. Worth every cent. If you are an Eric fan you have to buy this set.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Funny , witty show. great to watch with any member of family. exception for little children, they must likely wont get the quips and jokes.
0671449028|5.0|Love it! We've read it to all our kids, so now we pretty much say it from memory. I like to give it to expecting moms at baby showers along with some of my other favorite books. I always hear back that this is a big hit.
B000FC146C|5.0|Loved the mini series, loved the book even better. Even if you saw the mini series,<br />you will really enjoy the book. There is so much more to tell in the book.
B000BTJDG2|4.0|The movie is quite interesting with the court proceedings and I could determine from the film why Emily Rose continued to be subjected to attacks from Demonic spirits. These Satanic or demonic attacks happen if people have \\"unclean\\" things or are disobedient to God or are not living a life of full committment to the lord God or if there is a curse. The Holy Bible is very clear that people who live a life of faithful committment to the lord God will have Gods protection by coming to the lord God through Jesus Christ but NOT THE MOTHER MARY as shown in the Emily Rose movie. This is the crux of the movie.<br /><br />Emily Rose did not recieve the lord Gods protection from the continued attacks by demonic forces because the priest was calling on the \\"mother Mary's\\" protection hence he was preaching counterfeit scriptures when the Holy Bible clearly states the lord Gods protection must be accessed by coming to God through Jesus Christ. Satans existence on earth is to decieve people away from the lord God and to have people worship himself instead. It is very well known that the mormon churches, JW's, and other churches use clearly modified and COUNTERFEIT SCRIPTURES to decieve \\"followers\\" away from the lord Gods salvation and protection from Satans demonic forces. These counterfeit churches are a part of Satans empire to decieve would be followers away from the lord God.<br /><br />\\"Therefor, there is now no condemnation for those whom are in CHRIST JESUS, because through Christ Jesus the law of the spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.\\" (Romans 8:1-2).<br /><br />People will come to know that Satans demonic forces and the lord Gods dominion are real. The Demonic forces tend to attack \\"followers\\" if they are disobedient (to God) and \\"unbelievers\\" (the general public) who don't live committed christian lives and therefore don't have Gods protection. In the supernatural world Satan is much lower than the lord God and must have a valid claim against Godsfollowers eg disobedience (to God), being an \\"unbeliever\\" before Satan will attack people but the lord God has power over Satan's domain. By living a life of committment to the lord God and obeying his commands in the Holy Bible Gods faithful followers will not be harmed by these Demonic forces. This is why Gods committed followers have to be clean from Satans traits eg pride,arrogance, greed,vanity, sexual \\"lust\\" (flesh). Otherwise Satans demonic forces will decieve, influence and tempt people to engage in these traits to perpetrate violence and sin against other people. Provided Gods followers are obedient to the lord Gods precepts and commands these demonic forces should not be able to harm you.<br /><br />Although I am living in a life of committment to the lord God I experienced a strong attack by demonic spiritual forces very quickly after I began to watch this movie during the evening of Thursday 7 November 2013 (NZ time). The demonic forces came into the home with the DVD movie a \\"window\\" for them to enter the home. My appendix was pinched and the demonic forces occupied my facial muscles and tried to stop me from reading the biblical \\"blood scriptures.\\" The demonic spiritual forces fled after I finished repeatedly praying the blood scriptures aloud. However, the demonic attacks returned during the night when I was in bed but after reading the \\"blood scriptures\\" aloud they quickly fled after trying to occupy my body and they did not return.<br /><br />If you experience Satanic or Demonic spiritual attacks then you should read the biblical blood scriptures:<br /><br />NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD (title).<br /><br />\\"We overcome Satan when we testify personally to what the word of God says the blood of JESUS does for us.<br />Through the blood of JESUS, I am redeemed out of the hand of the devil.<br />Through the blood of JESUS, all my sins are forgiven.<br />Through the blood of JESUS, I am continually being cleansed from all sin.<br />Through the blood of JESUS,I am justified, made righteous, just-as-if-ied never sinned.<br />Through the blood of JESUS, I am sanctified, made holy, set apart to God.<br />Through the blood of JESUS, I have boldness to enter into the presence of God.<br />The blood of JESUS cries out continually to God in heaven on my behalf.<br /><br />I give mighty praise and thanks to the lord God, the most high, i pray in Jesus Christ name, amen, hallelujah.\\"
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is not the same game that's on FB. It's a baby game no strategy required.<br />Only asks for amounts.
B00AEBBAF4|5.0|Got this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend since it's one of his favorites. Delivery was fast and blu-ray was well priced.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I really got into it. The main problem is the ending though. I almost through my kindle across the room at the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed watching while I was off work recouperating.  The story was engaging and I liked seeing the home, clothes and mannerisms of that era.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Not quite believable, I realize it's just a movie but was depressing none the less. I guess it was okay.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My world has changed since my Pinterest account.  It is my goto place for relaxing, I like to just browse through all the pins when I have time to relax.<br />I use pinterest for finding gift ideas and what is trending.<br />Pinterest is a great source for looking up recipes or getting dinner ideas or that special foo foo drink and dessert ideas and recipes.<br />Even though I like to try to be crafty and a do-it-yourselfer, you don't have to be to find a lot of use for Pinterest.<br />A helpful feature is being able to have secret boards where no one but you will see what you have pinned, I have one for gift ideas.  Or you can send a pin to a friend if you want to share what you found.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Of the FREE ones, this is the one I'm most comfortable with. I keep getting the message, on startup, that the app is outdated, and soon I won't even be able to log on -- but the link takes you to Google, which doesn't like Kindle, even though most Google apps will work just fine on our spunky little machines. Other Facebook apps may be glitzier, but this one seems to get the job done . . . and, despite the dire warning, I'm having no trouble logging on.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's the best game ever I can play this game all night.  THE only thing I don't like is that u have to pay to keep  playing maybe someone can look into a better way to get there  yes it's cheap to keep playing when u get to the end make it harder to get pass
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really enjoy this game. I like the fact that it has a limited amount of time and I can't play it for hours at a time.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A book to tug at your heartstrings.. a truly magnificent tale. I enjoyed every sentence, this is the second time I have read this book and its an instant classic. I hope the film adaptation will be just as good
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting read. Who can actually say if it's all true, we weren't there. But as former military, I'd say alot of the story fits together.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|Had on my smartphone and it finally came available on my kindle bigger screen makes me like it even more
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|ItsGreat! It is affordable, inexpensive and portable. I dont wait for more apps for the chromecast, this product has a big future
B0051YKV4A|5.0|MUST HAVE FOR ALL GRUNGE OR MUSIC LOVERS! Classic performances as the band's first time performing together in 2 years.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this website!!!  This is the best D Y I website!!  I can learn to cook, can learn to can jelly and make anything that I could imagine.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As you pull It on it gradually slips into place and it grows more comfortable with each movement of your hand. The familiarity combined with the surprise, being drawn in by the here and now of the narrative and the uncertainty of the outcome for the characters in the next paragraph compel you to keep reading. A great escape and a great story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is awesome.  It's super lightweight and has minimal load times. It's surprising how convenient it is to control your Netflix and Hulu shows from your touchscreen device of choice.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Great moving with twists and turns to keep you engaged in the story.  Denzel's character was interesting and it gave me a glimpse into the mindset of a person with dependencies.
055358202X|5.0|martin is always so sic! people say its not great cuz of the absence of a few key players but just made me want the next volume more!
B0070YDOT8|2.0|Reviews told me I didn't want to add this to my Kindle.  Others talked of folks messing with their emails and again wanting more money.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I loved this book!! It was hysterical! The writer did a terrific job of making the characters quirky and interesting. There were several interesting storylines happening throughout the book and I was curious to see how all of them would work out. The main character is one that you really root for!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Over all it is okay but my Kindle takes awhile to load it.  There are only a few puzzles unless I want to purchase more.  So free isn't all that free.
0812550706|1.0|A badly paced book, with wooden characters, choc full of lame ass ideas. I'm struggling to find something good to say about this book. Maybe some discussion on the how bad war is (hmm, maybe my 2 year old son knows that one) or maybe we could discuss why heroes are murderers (hmm again my cat could have worked that one out). Probably the worst book I've read in a decade (and I read a lot). Oh and by the way the big reveal, was completely obvious, oh and additionally nothing made any sense. Please buy something else and save yourself the agony. If I was marking a report I'd give the author an F for fail.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|I just wish I didn't have to log on to facebook to get more plays or purchase more coins.  It does challenge my mind and I do enjoy the 7 or so times I get to play before I'm out of times.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Great show, what else needs to be said?  (its advisible that you see the prior seasons so you can understand the characters, behaviours etc. else you may be LOST).
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I have wasted lots of time playing and I don't have any extra to spare. My kids like it also. It's a fun game
1904994679|5.0|Why are people ranting about the format? It is not badly organized. Anyway, this book is stuffed with interesting facts, and I love the creepy crawly fact file! It is also great how it really tests your knowledge, like on pg. 16, myth conceptions talks about how the tallest mountain is NOT Everest. I love it!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I've been struggling to put into words why I so violently disliked Allegiant after so eagerly anticipating it for months. It's hard to narrow down a list of all of the things that I hated about it, but these are the things that stood out:<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />1) Derivative plot. It was basically \\"The Village\\" with better technology. That's not to say that there wasn't the potential for a good book in there. Just that the execution was so ham-handed that it brought the derivative nature of the plot into much sharper focus.<br /><br />2) Completely inconsistent characterization. I mean, night and day differences from Divergent to Allegiant. In many cases, it was hard to believe that Roth was even writing about the same characters. This was somewhat  of an issue from Divergent to Insurgent, but the better plot and pacing helped to gloss over those issues a bit. There is no such distraction in Allegiant. Many of the significant plot points happened because of a character behaving in ways that were completely out of character. That made the fallout of those decisions feel like manipulations, not an earned reaction. I didn't believe what she was having them do, so what followed was completely unrealistic to me.<br /><br />3) My feeling that as the plot points (and deaths) added up, that they were not contributing to a greater whole. Look, I have no problem with entertainment that has a high body count. Games of Thrones, The Walking Dead, Justified, The Sopranos, Deadwood, the Wire, Oz, Homicide-I love them all. But the difference between those series and Allegiant is that the deaths in those stories served a purpose. They moved the plot along, they were used for the development of other characters, SOMETHING. The reactions they caused felt earned, not something to jerk your chain just because the showrunner felt like messing with you.<br /><br />There was no point to the deaths in Allegiant. Beloved characters dropped like flies for seemingly no reason at all. Horrible characters emerged without a scratch. And pointlessly horrible things happened. E.g. Tori dying right before the others discover the compound where her brother is still alive. The big event, which was IMO pointless and completely avoidable. Roth's choices seemed to just be for shock value, rather than to add anything to the story. I don't like stories that are so obvious about trying to be a tearjerker.<br /><br />4) The whole thing felt like a rush job. I would really like to see what could have happened if Roth had been given a longer timeline to work in and a better team of editors. Whoever edited this mess should be fired and blackballed from the industry.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I kept thinking of ways that the story could have been told better. There are a lot of interesting places that Allegiant could have gone and a lot of cool things it could have done. But Roth chose to do none of them.<br /><br />I can't recommend Allegiant to anyone. Not for fans of the series, not for anyone who is at all attached to the characters, and certainly not for teenagers. It is truly horrible and I would not suggest that anyone spend their time or money on it. I took the bullet of reading it for all of us, and my conclusion is that I would be happier pretending that this half-baked mess never happened. I reject Allegiant's very existence. As far as I'm concerned, the series ended with Insurgent. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it, no matter how much Truth Serum you give me.orrible characters emerged without a scratch.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|And I have read them all. Great discussion of race relations from many perspectives and seeds planted for the path to reconciliation. Thank you again John Grisham, you always engage me from first page to last!
B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|What tries to pass itself off as \\"atmospheric\\" lacks the requisite tension and the first half is nothing short of dull.  The second half, while quickened in pace,  sadly telegraphs each revelation well before you have a chance to get absorbed in the \\"suspense.\\"  Worst of all, the multi talented Sara Paxon is largely wasted in this effort.  While I like both gorey and spookey both, this is neither.  A waste of talent and your time.  Zzzzzzzz
B000X2H8G4|3.0|Don't expect that this product will be a very helpful one. It performs marginally. Kids might like to play with it for a coolness factor.
B004EPZ084|3.0|Fantastic cast.  Good story idea.  Not hilarious, but amusing in parts.  Overall this is just meh.  No one I watched it with even laughed out loud.  A lame script,  poor editing and direction relegates this one to the bargain bins.  Would not recommend.
B00B5C0YOO|1.0|This app basically allows you to backup app install files ( the apk), or a link to the app download. You can do it on demand or have it do it automatically. One big oversight is that you cannot back up the app data. basically it allows you to keep different app release versions, but none of your personal progress in games, and none of your other changes in non-game apps.<br /><br />There are no instructions as to what buttons do, and also importantly, there is no abort or stop function once you accidentally start it backing up all your apps manually because you were testing what a button's functionality was. So, if you are like me and have hundreds of apps and accidentally start that process you are stuck for a potentially long time while it creates apk backups and saves them to precious empty memory. If this happens, you need to \\"force stop\\" the program in your tablet's or phone's settings.<br /><br />So in summary, if you use this program to backup every app you install and end up wanting a previous app's version after an update for some reason, this app may be great for that. If you have a problem where your favorite game gets messed up and all of your data gets deleted or corrupted and you end up reinstalling it because you have it \\"backed up\\", none of your progress will be restored. it will be like you installed the app for the first time.<br /><br />*Update*<br />After reading a review that said rooted devices are able to back up app data with this program I decided to look at the app on Amazon's website instead of just from my device in the app store.  There is more mentioned as to what this app does than I originally saw. It does mention that rooted devices have more functionality, but nowhere is it mentioned that the app user data is backed up.  Since I am not using a rooted device, I can't comment on functionality with root.  If it works great for some, then that is awesome. In my opinion though it still rates very low because everything in my above reviewstill stands. I would recommend users try Helium from the Clockworkmod developers. It is a solid back-up program that does not require root. It does require a PC, Mac or Linux computer to connect to your phone or tablet though. If you do have a rooted device, then there are many more programs available to you to back-up your device.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome! I love it. It has great features and graphs.And the minions are so cute.This is my rating.
0316322407|5.0|Excellent book.  Great courage to write in todays environment. I hope she attains her goals.<br />The new book arrived in excellent condition.
B00DGN51O8|2.0|Well......I thought the acting was sub-par. Story line off a bit. Special effects could not save this film. I did not even finish the movie.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I love playing pool.  This game is fun and lets you play against other people without having to deal with chatting.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This is a great app to see your computer screen on your phone or tablet.  Its very clear with good resolution.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is so addicting!  You start to play, and before you know it time has flown by! Not crazy about having to enlist others just to get to the next level though.
B004856SQ8|5.0|Great Movie and this blu ray quality makes it that much better.  I would recommend i to anyone.  You will not be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If u play this game one time u are hooked love it play at least once a day to unwind and relieve stress😜😜😜😜
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to find out this came to Kindle! I have become re addicted! If you haven't already you need to play it!
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Good fast read. I love the quick pass,the humor and how the new partners relate. A couple of twists here and there,  a fun read.
0385737955|5.0|I think this book is really good.  It is action packed especially the scene where Thomas gets stuck out in the maze with Minho and Alby.  I love the scene where they knock the Grievers off the cliff.  I cannot wait to read the other books in the trilogy, The Scorch Trials, The Death Cure, and The Kill Order and am waiting for the movie to come out on February 12, 2014.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love puzzles and this is a great app. I don't have to worry about lossing pieces or putting it away. I can take it with me anywhere.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|City of Ashes keeps making want more just like the book before it. And it's great that there is more!
B009CVRQLY|5.0|This is an amazing pop album from start to finish. Celine's voice sounds better and stronger than ever, and the songwriting and production are top notch. Definitely the best pop album since Adele's 21!
B005HESLUA|5.0|I have always liked this, just wanted to see all the episodes. I think the later seasons are better with 7 of 9 aboard.
B008DYZKQE|4.0|A classic Munsch tale about an unmanly prince and a strong, wise princess. A little abrupt, though I suppose that is part of the effect and charm of this little tale.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Ever get bored of the normal tablet game? Well you are saved this is hands down a great time killer. Download it NOW!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is challenging and mind boggling and the different levels are fun.  Not sure what all the different categories mean.
006202406X|2.0|Just finished the book a few minutes ago. OK plot but the ending was awful. I wish I hadn't read if.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Considering that the basis for this story is a dystopian society the ending is kind of inevitable. She definitely through a few surprises into this last installment and yet Roth finishes the series with hope. I appreciated the different vantage points of this novel. At moments the narration voicing between Tris and Tobias are a little too similar but I liked getting to see the story from different angles. I'm satisfied with how Roth ended it and I'm excited to see how her writing develops in the future.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Definitely worth the price. Works great on my Kindle Fire.  App loads quickly and always offers just the right amount of challenge.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I really didn't care for the book.  There were too many stories and no thread to tie them to one another.<br />I found it a chore to read.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|This is just a gold mine of Hall of Fame talent: The Mighty Frank out front, the Incomparable Count Basie and his band backing Frank, and Quincy Jones conducting! There is no possible way to put these titans together and come out with anything less than musical gold. All were at the top of their game, and nobody hit a wrong note. Basie's instrumentals were pure genius, and even Frank's storytelling during this set was superb. This album is definitely one for the ages!!! (The only other live album I would put in the same class is the equally legendary Sam Cooke's performance at Miami's Harlem Club.) BRAVO!!!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Looks and works great on my fire hdx. Challenging with a lot of screens and options to keep you interested. Worth the money!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I must be a dope.  I bought this mostly to figure out what it is and what I was missing.<br /><br />I already have a roku and netflix.  What was I thinking?  I can watch youtube on my tv now.  So what?
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I think this app is very  educated and appropriate  for young children. I would recommend this app for young children who need help with math facts. There is only one thing that I would recommend, and it is that you can also put a little math quiz to make your app more fun or interesting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book along with the other two were all very good books.  One of those series you can read over and over again.
B00E6F155E|5.0|Just an amazing show. I this tour and the 2013 So tour and the blu ray is a great souvenir.<br />Sound and video quality are top notch. It was shot on 35 mm film.  Can't wait to see the video from the current tour.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I love this movie as well of the rest of the Tolken collection! Not much into the special features so I never watched them but the DVD with the film seems to function great!
B00E6F154A|5.0|This blu ray is so good it really makes me upset I did not see the tour when it was in Oakland. Bryan Ferry is so timeless. Great video and audio. This is a must have.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Must have for any Godfather fan! Blu-Ray took the experience to the next level, picture was fantastic! Love this series!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's a need to read. An easy book with good  context and can still get an amazing point across. Bravo!
B00130EVSS|4.0|Awesome Russian Mob movie. Definitely not appropriate for children though. Great story line with lots of action. Not for the faint of heart.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|My friend has this app and used it to located an animal finding under her bed. I unfortunately downloaded this to my kindle. My kindle doesn't have a camera so it wouldn't work (duh, my fault)
B004JN1D2I|5.0|George R.R. Martin really knows how to write a page turner.  Excellent details in descriptions of settings and characters.  Edge of your seat plot line.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|This started out really well and I was looking forward to advancing in the game. However, it kept freezing early on in the game. After all the frustration, I just deleted it.  I wish it had worked because it looked very interesting.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|I like every thing Marvel is involved with. It's a childhood weakness. Aside from that Amazon makes it truly affordable !!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I absolutely adore this game. Unfortunately, it is very addictive. You start out building a reef and getting homework assignments to add things and grow different plants. The music is soothing but can get a little monotonous after a while.  Some people may get frustrated but if you are patience you can advance to many different levels without spending a dime. I am currently on level 24 and haven't bought anything yet.<br />Best game ever!!
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|Dark. Depressing. Not what I was expecting from the ads. Too long. What a downer. Time better spent doing something else.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this author! I'd read her stuff everyday if she wrote more books! Very compelling series! Can't wait for the next installment!
B00G32OER4|5.0|Loved it!  Nice and scary exactly what I was looking for! Scary scary scary!  If you want goose bumps this is perfect
B000T433CO|4.0|Its a cute movie, great for an evening on your own, and... a couple of points about &#34;when a relationship is not healthy and will never go anywhere&#34; really hit the spot.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love this book... it was so addicting and unable to put down.  I would suggest this to any and everyone,  even men can learn a little something from this book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is a Great item and it Works Perfect. i Will Buy this product again the shipping was fast. the most important thing to me is that this product work and i don't have any thing bad to say about it.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love this show. It is wonderfully written and produced. It keeps me wanting more and the cases they try are so different each time. I also like that they have recurring clients, which is realistic.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a Great item and it Works Perfect. i Will Buy this product again the shipping was fast. the most important thing to me is that this product work and i don't have any thing bad to say about it.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|Bummed I didn't get this back to amazon in time.  The disk freezes up constantly so it's impossible to sit and watch the movie.  my girls were scared the first time we 'attempted' to watch it and then it got tossed back in the case and I forgot about it until now...5 months later and popped it in to watch with them.  same thing, lousy disk.  hopefully you'll be more on top of things than myself if you get a defect :(
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|This movie is an absolute delight for any Shakespeare and Whedon fan. Nathan Fillion makes a hilarious Dogberry and Clark Gregg makes an even better Leonato. The use of black and white only intensifies the intensity of the acting. I had the best time watching this movie and finding every Whedon fandom, this is a treat for any Avengers,Firefly,Angel and Buffy fan. But the ultimate cherry on the top of this fandom treat... we get A Fred & Wesley reunion!!!!!!
B00CRS5HII|4.0|Mr. Rucker has seemed to have made a smooth transition from one music Genre to another with no noticeable missteps. A move that can be tricky and dangerous for some artists. He has done so with success. Regardless of the Genre, he delivers.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Mystery manor is a great game. I don't like the fact you're energy level does not last long at all. I have liked the hidden objects scenes.wish you could have more time when your searching for items. I. don't like that you have to spend money on or to advance in the game.But I enjoy the game. Johanna Braddom
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Would be better if it was kindle/audio for when you are in the car and still want to read!!! I love reading on the kindle app but when I have to drive.....I hate have to put down a good book!
0736092269|5.0|i love it!! Great book to start working out. Everything is explain well and simple to understand. I would recommend this to anyone.
0061537969|5.0|There is something about books that do not get too complicated. The story is simple but well told and in its own way reflects how life is, simple if we choose it to be so. I learned several lessons as well. Worth reading it for sure.
B004PAHZMC|2.0|I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 9-year-old son.  He really enjoys it as a playmat and carrying case for his Legos, but one of the zippers on the side broke after several days of using it as it was intended (i.e. he didn't try to put too much into it, and didn't throw it or play with it roughly.)
0307730700|5.0|I found this book very well written and easy to read.  This is a story about an amazing man and his family.  Adam always gave 100%.  Showing how God worked through him and his family was awesome.  Our spirituality can provide strength to overcome anything.  I respect all the warriors that have gone in harms way so that we can be free.  Thank you.
B00EAI94AA|5.0|I enjoyed this movie top to bottom and all the way across.<br />It was all here and it hit the marks time and time again.<br />Story, cast, acting, shot selection and color pallet all working together really drew me.<br />As a fan of good movies, horror movies, and good horror movies this satisfies on many levels.<br />Not all will agree but all should give it a try.
B00EKJWS1Q|1.0|The computer I was on automatically sent me to outlook and changed everything without me knowing what was happening.  Now I have to go several different places to get my hotmail emails,  Also it automatically changed my Iphone and I had no directions or knowledge of how to access my old email  on my phone.  My kindle does not support outlook and an app had to be downloaded and again with no directions or explanation why any of this has happened.  I could no longer access my emails on my kindle.  This is not at all acceptable and should not be automatically forced on someone.
0143116177|5.0|I wanted this to accompany the TV show based on the book.  It arrived promptly, in good condition, and my husband is well pleased with it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone. I think it transcends age & brings us into the world created by Suzanne Collins.
B006FE83UE|5.0|My favorite movie and my favorite scenes in a movie of all time. Has all of the right massages. Atticus leaving the court and the sheriff'sspeech at the end, along with neighbor's observation to Scout about Atticus.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was waiting for this application to be available on the kindle fire and now my addiction is in full swing!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Had I known what a homophobic tool Orson Scott Card was prior to reading this book, I would never have purchased it. However, a good friend recommended the book as a thought-provoking story. Standing on its own, it is an excellent story which I enjoyed. It certainly has its share of deep moral dilemmas. It is also an unfortunate portrait of some serious issues the author has within himself with regards to authority, religion and  sexuality. For someone so outspoken against homosexuals, he spends a great deal of time depicting his characters (mostly boys) being naked. For me that makes the author more than a little hypocritical in his public rantings.
006202406X|3.0|Was mostly a great book, although it felt rushed at some parts. 3 stars because of ending. In my opinion this was not the best way to end the series.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This a good little machine to convert your old slides. It works well, a little slow, but once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I am so happy that I found your site. In NZL we cannot always get the latest CD's so this is such a bonus.<br />Thank you Amazon !
B008UWEFU6|5.0|Reading this book was great. Best book I have ever read. My girl and I read it together. Wow Wow.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|Was kinda boring but it was well designed I was probably expecting something else but you may like I did not
B00821OX98|4.0|Well to me should have a better pilot. I mean stargate sg1 and other sci fi tv had a pilot which explain how things turn to be the way the tv series beginning
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard app I ever used and I used a lot it increases my typing speed by about 50 % or more
B00G32OMF8|2.0|I could go into a long diatribe about why I didn't like this movie. I loved the first one &#34;Before Sunrise.&#34; I think everyone fell in love with Julie and Ethan in that one. I think in some ways they should have left it at that. &#34;Before Sunset&#34; was a little bit of a disappointment to me because I was hoping they had both been pining away for each other and that they would walk into the sunset happily ever after. I guess I'm a sentimentalist and like fairy tale endings. The time between movies is a negative to me as well. This last movie &#34;Before Midnight&#34; was a complete letdown. It popped my bubble from the first movie completely. Long, meaningless conversations about basically nothing, disgusting language, a bedroom scene I could have done without, and a lot of bitching. If you haven't watched any of them, stop with the first.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Great prequel, good story!  Fun for everyone in the family, all ages were laughing throughout, and it's not your typical ending, which is typical for Pixar.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game.. I'm happy I play it besides only playing Survivalcraft. I like both games Survivalcraft and Minecraft PE I bought this one because I miss the zombies (etc. that survivalcraft does not have) and like getting the chills from them. lol  Survivalcraft is a nice game too I use Survivalcraft for making custom worlds [has poweruser-like map editing (e.g. creative mode)] I like both games both of these games have strengths in which the other one may lack.. which is OK I don't mind I just love playing both of these games for causal gameplay I play MC PE and for my creative map modding I play Survivalcraft.. They're both great games and are very similar and fun to play.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|By now you know the outline of the plot: Professor Don Tillman, boy (well, middle-aged) genius, with the absence of social skills that generally afflicts people with Asperger's Syndrome to a greater or lesser degree, launches an overly-planned project to find a wife, using all the logic the never enters into a love relationship.  Don represents a type of Asperger's that's actually extremely rare, and if I had a complaint about the book it would be that uninitiated readers will have the myth of the autistic genius reinforced.  Few Aspies can run their lives at the level that Don does, let alone teach genetics at \\"a prestigious university,\\" as Don himself describes it. (And never mind his expertise at martial arts.) But if this reader (i.e. *moi*), closely involved with the Aspie world, can put that aside for a few hours, perhaps you can, too.  And then, like me, you'll probably find it delightful to listen to Don's ingenuous interpretation of the world around him.  So go ahead and throw your disbelief out the same four-storey window that Don manages to climb out of when a mad plastic surgeon tries to trap him.  Have fun.[[ASIN:1582971358 Get That Novel Written!]]
B006UKFFE0|5.0|If you read one book on entrepreneurship, let this be it.  It summarizes a lot of the 'best' ideas in entrepreneurship (Steve Blank, Eric Ries, others) and gives you a very practical guide to getting started.  At one point in the past, it would have been possible to 'push' a product onto users.  Now, unless you are a company like Apple it is almost impossible.  There are thousands of other start-ups that will do what you do AND listen to users.<br /><br />The idea of systematically de-risking your business idea is a powerful way to get up and running with the smallest amount of money possible.  If you have a business idea but you're not sure whether it's viable, Ash will give you a step by step plan for bringing it from the canvas to making money.<br /><br />As another positive, the author seems to genuinely be interested in engaging with people who read the book.  If this book doesn't answer a question you have, you could probably ask him.  That's pretty good value for a book.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Great, fast-moving, riveting. And while I'm not really a fan of gore, this film's only flaw was that it needed to be a little less clean, a little less safe, and more messy. Still very much worth your time if you like action-horror at all.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Can't see what all the fuss is about. Only read 20% of it then closed it in disgust. Complete waste of time and money
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The author draws you in with emotion, hope, and realism. As I read the chapters I saw a great gift unfolding,and hoped with each turn of the page a happy ending. Instead I received a real view of the world with its heart aches, surprises, twists and turns. Excellent read to transport the reader into the meaning of flowers, relationships, lives lost and battles won. Great read!
1401242855|5.0|Scott Snyder does a tremendous job of restarting  the Batman mythos. He keeps to the core concepts that longtime fans love while also introducing new ones that keep the story fresh in the new 52 universe.<br /><br />Greg Capullo is a great addition. I loved his work with the Spawn comic series and his gritty recreations of Batman's Rogue's Gallery are amazing.<br /><br />No bad comments for this set!
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|Very cliche-ridden and amped up, with little of the clever funny banter that you usually get with a Willis/die hard movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is additive,  Lot's of fun and great to pass time,  still trying to pass my husband's level : )
B000F8O35U|5.0|How neat that this is out again.  I cannot believe how old it looks, but my daughter loves it and she is the real test.
B003G94BZC|5.0|This season had its ups and downs, but was overall a great introduction to a new Doctor. I loved David Tennant's tenth Doctor, but Matt Smith has really done a great job of putting his own stamp on the role.
B0001I561E|4.0|The real test is my daughter and she really enjoys this.  It is not her favorite but certainly in the rotation.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|It is really well written and has an amazing story line! It was really enjoyable for me to read and I really recommend it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Awesome and addicting!  you gotta love how easy and time consuming this game is I definately reccomend it to pass time!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think that can you escape is the most fun mind game I have ever played and it is also addicting because I can't stop playing it.
B003VS0CWY|5.0|Fantastic reprduction on the Blue ray. Even if you have a DVD already I strongly recommend you add a Blue ray for this movie
B007IXWKUK|4.0|What a hoot! Badly written story of a young innocent seduced by an intriguing, extremely rich young man with an alternative life style. It IS a romance, and not unlike a Cinderella story. If the author had sought intelligent help, this could have been a better book.  A bit less detailed sex would have helped!  Repetition of words and phrases drove me nuts. I think she needs to write a fourth book and tie up some unanswered questions.  What happened to Mia? What about Christian's birth family-----he could meet them and that would be interesting...they could be normal or nuts. Just why was Carla's third husband weird? The author needs to introduce a realistic problem they could face.......and make them more normal.  How did Ana grow in her marriage?  What about Christian's desire to feed the world?  Maybe a handicapped child, or a death in the family, or just anything unexpected. The author dropped hints about things but never followed through. Sure there could be more sex, and even kinky sex, but not such idiotic descriptions!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This guy is one of the greatest singers in modern music history. Should be standing next to Bob Dylan and John lennon
B002O3Z50Q|5.0|Oh, my this is a good movie. I watched it as I checked things out on the internet. It was emotional and compelling. Josh Groben's song Remember at the end summed the movie up beautifully. I've watched this more than once. It doesn't get old.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Ok, there were a few errors in the movie. In Monsters, Inc Mike says \\"You've been jealous of my good looks since the second grade\\" to Sully. Yet in MU, they only meet in college. Big error there. Second error was in Monsters, Inc, they didn't recognize the Abominable Snowman. Yet at the end of MU, they were working with/for him. At least we now know why the Snowman was banished. :)<br /><br />Other than these couple of contingency errors, I think MU was great. It was fun, exciting, and just a great movie to watch with the family. I definitely recommend seeing this.
B0081336FO|5.0|Just a well done show. It has movie-level production quality. Sometimes, it moves so fast that I can't follow it, but I can't blame the show for that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions so much. The game represents them well.<br />I really love the clip at the beginning.<br />D
B008NA3HZ4|5.0|What an unexpected gem!  So human, so real. This movie gently, but also intensely explores facets of love and the intoxication of love.  I don't want to reveal anything about the plot though.<br /><br />Michelle Williams … I think this might be her at her best.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that stay with you, lingering in your mind.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This is Gladwell's best book yet, the idea that being small and agile creates more opportunities than being big is an intriguing concept.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game but hate that I can never use the extra lives friends send me, so I am constantly running out of lives and having to wait. I don't accept them when my lives are full obviously, because then they won't count, but lately they don't show up to accept after my lives have run out either. Very frustrating!!!

031623480X|5.0|This book is cutting edge, presenting the latest research and nailing it on what everyone should do to ensure good health, period, and especially good mental health. If a person reads only one book this year, this should be the one.
B00C0ALZ0W|3.0|More specific stories/insights and fewer platitudes would have made the bookella more interesting to me. It was fine to read, but left me wanting for more meat and a bit less cheerleading. I think that the thesis of the book is exactly right; I'm just more interested in a conversation than a sales pitch.

This is ridiculous guys...the game worked just fine in the last update. Please fix this, I love playing it.
1250038820|4.0|I began following HONY a year ago when a friend suggested I may enjoy Stanton's photographs and interviews. The magic of HONY isn't in the photography or in the interviews, but in the intersections between them and the viewers. These photographs connect all of us, whether we are New Yorkers or from Nowhere, Kansas. These are vignettes of humanity -- from the very young to the very old.<br /><br />Take a moment, look at a few pages, put it down. The visual and textual stories will stay with you. Then go back later and take a look at a few different pages. Those stories will stay with you. That's the power of good storytelling.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works really well for work and stuff when I can't calculate something in my heart I highly recommend it<br /><br />It's good

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun ,easy,addictive with a few annoying features. Paying to continue sucks as does paying for not quest. Not worth it. But it's cute.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was quirky, different, funny and thought provoking at the same time. Very Highly recommended
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent!  Twists and turns that I did not anticipate.  I really enjoyed the writer&#34;s style and Intend to read more of Flynn&#34;s novels.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|This movie is just amazing.  The effects are great, even forty years later.  Every thing about this movie was cutting edge for it's time, and it holds up wonderfully.  Most people still consider Christopher Reeves to be the Quintessential Superman, and this is by far his best film.  This movie is all about just being able to forget all the problems with the world and just allow yourself to be happy and believe that all of your childhood dreams are real.  Possibly still the best comic book movie.  Forget Star Wars, this was the first real film that was supposed to be a series before Warner took creative control away from Richard Donner.<br /><br />The four disc version of the film is a real treat with all kinds of great behind the scenes stuff, two discs worth, as well as a director's cut of the film and the original theatrical cut.  Definitely worth it for the fans.
0547258305|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was very well written and had deep, compelling characters. I did feel like the pacing was off a bit. I often forced myself to read on but I am happy I did because this was a great read. The world created by Cashore is one of a kind. This story had a very medieval feel to it but because it had  people with different graces aka abilities running around it allowed for an incredibly foreign world. It's completely different from anything you have read before. A must read.
B0082LUEW8|2.0|As I have noted in my other reviews, HellYeah are pretty consistent at making radio friendly rock/metal that is not amazing, but this outing is by far the worst album yet.  I had really high hopes after the mediocre Stampede.  There was a lot of lip service given by the band that the record company was responsible for the sound of the band's first two albums and they had left their old studio to be able to do things on their own, and with their pedigree, who wouldn't have been excited to hear this.  They also said that they needed to pull out all of the stops here and go back to the roots of what made each member successful and reclaim their own sound.  In reality, it was just the members selling what they knew that fans wanted to hear, as this is not even as hard as their first album, and lacks the soul or the continuity (not in terms of the album, but even the songs here seem to lack direction, and could have benefited from some serious edits and rewrites.)  There are two stand out tracks here, neither of which made the single list, Rape/Burn and WM Free.  The first here is an amazing drum song, with Vinnie really showing that he was the best drummer in the world at one point, and combining that with the technical prowess that Mudvayne were known for.  I kind of expect to not like the radio singles, but have often found some of the deeper cuts more to my liking on their albums, and hearing this song really gave me high hopes for the rest of the album that would soon fall flat.  Between You and Nowhere, while it tries to be the slower country ballad that we saw work so well in the first two albums, really is yet another paint by numbers would be single that falls flat.  Very little in this album works, and it makes it all that much more sad that the members seem to be having so much fun together and not looking to get back with their previous bands.  As a die hard Mudvayne fan, it makes it really hard to support Chad and Greg and is making me feel the kind of drama that the split in Pantera brought.  Makes me think that maybe all that drama is at Vinnie's door.that the split in Pantera brought.  Makes me think that maybe all that drama is at Vinnie's door.
006202406X|2.0|Oh my, where to begin.<br /><br />If the terrible reviews don't give you a good idea of how bad this book was maybe this will.<br /><br />**this review contains spoilers**<br /><br />First off the different narrators. It was impossible to tell the difference between when Tris was narrating and when Tobias was. Half the time I would be halfway through the chapter and completely forget who was speaking. If you are going to write in two different voices, make sure the reader can tell them apart.<br /><br />Second, the entire idea of GPs. I'm sorry but I just didn't buy it. It seemed such a boring way to explain the factions. If you are going to have this become about genetics it needs to be more in depth. I felt cheated with the whole genetically pure versus defected. It made the entire first two books seem useless and unimportant.<br /><br />Third, Tris' death. I am completely fine with an author having creative freedom and I am cool with a story not having a happy ending BUT and this is a big but if you are going to kill off the main character it has to matter. Tris' death was pointless, she survived the death serum only to be shot is just pointless. There was no need to do this other than to show the reader what they already know, we live in a sad and unfair world. The reader doesn't need to be reaffirmed of what they already know. We read books to be transported into a different world where anything can happen. Her death was dumb and served no purpose other than the shock factor.<br /><br />Fourth, the ending. I'm sorry but you cannot have a world so turn apart and end it so easily. Changing a view peoples minds doesn't really do much of anything. The book ended without much being done about the GPs and GDs. Yes, Chicago seemed have become some small little Utopia but Roth doesn't really explain much about how it happens and the state of the rest of the world. It all just seemed very unrealistic and rushed.<br /><br />In conclusion I am left feeling that a completely different author wrote this last book. The first two were incredible but this was just boring, monotone and accomplished nothing. The entire third book I felt disconnected from Tris to the point where when she died I didn't care. I honestly could barely call this a conclusion to the series since it seemed so disconnected from the other two books. I feel I could have enjoyed this book had it not been the conclusion of the Divergent series. This book just didn't do the series justice, I have never been more disappointed in the ending of a series.

I also loved that king gave us an update on Dan and abroad lives after a few years. Another another classic.
B00D9RQO56|5.0|The movie was in excellent shape and brand new in the wrapping as described.  This movie fast became a Halloween classic as soon as it was released and now my family makes it a point to watch this movie each and every Halloween.

B00FHATBGW|5.0|Big Fish just keeps us all happy. You will love this game is lot. I am s member of the Big Fish club that you can get into for pc games. I don't know how they can do it, but this game is 6.99 for this game on pc. So you are getting a bargain and it is highly rated online. I played it on pc and its lots of fun. So this one is a definite win for all of us h/o adventure lovers. If you don't like the wait for these on kindle, which they're getting them out faster, you can get hundreds of them for your laptop or pc. Either way they are the best when it comes to this genre, so jump on in the pond and enjoy Big Fish. I know this sounds like an ad, but I swear I'm just a lover of the Big Fish games.
B0043RSK3K|3.0|Interesting book.  Shows what our government is really like since WW1.  Ordinary people don't stand a chance when big business and the government get together.  Greed
B00ARF92HK|5.0|It was great and full of action. The plot thickens as the movie moves along. We loved watching this movie.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I've loved this movie since it's release in 1989 and recently decided to replace my DVD version with Blu-Ray. It is a yearly family tradition to watch it. There is side splitting laughter accompanied by lots of holiday traditions with a twist. Chevy Chase as well as all the other actors turn in all star performances.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Movie was ok, always love Morgan Freeman, but no much of him in this movie. Overall good movie. It's a murderous romantic comedy.

B00EHMG358|4.0|I like the Pendergast series, I'll probably buy the book when it is available.  I wonder how they will get Pendergast interested in this one.
B00EY7MFKS|3.0|It's okay yet the principle character's are more nerdy then super heroes. The new shield members are to silly and not believable regarding their scientific intelligence. There should be more characters with super powers involved in this series in order to live up to the Avenger movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very exciting a new twist around every corner, really enjoyed the book. Always kept me on the edge of my seat
0399159347|5.0|I found this book impossible to put down. The writing is clear and engaging, the characters are well-developed, and the plot is irresistible. I hadn't ever read anything by Ms. Moriarty before, but I will be looking for more of her books (she's already published four novels). I was lucky to have gotten this book at the May 2013 Book Expo America convention, held in New York City's Javits Center, although I didn't meet the author.<br /><br />Check out more reviews at [...]

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I like this game so much I'M A BOY THOUGH I just like it because u get to buy things like pets and buildings and I LOVE Animals so I would highly recommend if you get this app. Oh and it is free.
B00ATP24SW|4.0|They really sound like they're having fun again.  This new &#34;Rolf&#34; guy seems like he'll fit right in.  I noticed on their first music video that he seems like a tasty musician.  The drums had pressed steel hoops.  This tells me that he likes a less contained or more acoustic sound to his drums.  Also, the cymbal choices, from what I could see, were not very thick or heavy weighted cymbals.  This was encouraging to see too.  Tells me he gives consideration to being colorful; not just piercing with his accents.  The songs are fun, and everyone gets opportunity to shine!<br /><br />Knocked one star on the rating due to the mastering of the album (Kotipelto is often drowned out) and the guitar solos are pretty generic.  Fast & clean, but neither very moving nor memorable.  I hope he finds a more emotion grabbing style soon.  You would expect more from someone with his technical ability and list of influences.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|There's a reason everyone you know plays this game. It's hard to beat Bejewelled for an addicting match-three game but his does it in spades. Download it and enjoy!
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|This requires root..<br />It's way more powerful than you think. Its for those with a little more knowledge than the average user. Like settings and data backups. Its useful after flashing a new firmware or custom ROM. When you flash you get to restore your apps and data.  This saves data and net and leaves you where you were prior to reset or flash. Hope this helps.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter can't be beat! Season One lets you in on the fun! I'm a devoted eight season veteran fan. I bought this one again as a gift, and now my friend is also hooked! Once you see the whole season one, you will run to put season two in the player! Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter are Fabulous, as are the rest of this quirky cast! Gorry geeky fun for viewers above 16y.o. Sexual content, profanity, and adult themes, and murders. Is he a good guy doing bad stuff, or a bad guy doing good deeds, you decide! ENJOY!
B000SGSU58|5.0|I Love Michael Mallory's books.  I enjoy reading them and especially like Bosch.  He<br />is  a very determined, but,  follows the  rules, most of  the  time.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|The best movie musical of the 1940s, and one of the best Vincente Minnelli films (I can't decide if I like this or THE BAND WAGON more,) this is total Americana.  And perfect Garland.<br />One of the charmed films from 1944, (DOUBLE INDEMNITY, LAURA, MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK, HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO,) any one of which is vastly superior to the best picture Oscar winner, the embarrassingly mawkish GOING MY WAY.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Good read about two self-absorbed, flawed sad lovers:  the genius, Frank Lloyd Wright, and the selfish Memah Cheney.  Horan does a masterful job of placing them in their world as they hurtle toward a horrific end.
B00103584Y|4.0|Very clever, fast paced razzle-dazzle chase film. Speedy and enormous fun. Even people who won't look a foreign films with subtitles (certainly not me) succumb to this.
0743298039|3.0|The first part of the book which introduced the Angelfields family of sadists and masochists had me wishing my book club had chosen anything else.  As I continued to read though I got caught up in the mysteries of their stories and read as fast as I could.  Many twists and turns later, the ending was a HUGE disappointment.<br />SPOILER ALERT  How did they keep the \\"cousin\\" a secret for so many years??  How could she look so much like the twins that no one could tell the difference?  (Convenient for the story but completely implausible.) Why imply that Vida has rescued Adeline by mistake? It's clear later, by her devotion to her, that she is caring for Emmeline.  Where did the two of them go after the fire and how did Vida start her new life as an author?  How could she have kept Emmeline with her and hidden for 40 years,-- especially given Emmeline's state of mind and appearance and Vida's fame?  Aurelius called the woman who raised him \\"Mrs Love\\"?  Why didn't his father, Ambrose, who lived on a neighboring farm ever figure out that the foundling being raised by Mrs Love was his son?  When the hotel was being excavated, they found Adeline's bones,--- what about Charlie's?<br />I enjoyed the book until the ending which I found completely trite and impossible. I like a surprise ending but this one was beyond silly.
B001N3GUIE|3.0|Spectacular, somewhat literate, sci-fi from the 60's. Was really impressive, then. I saw it several times at a downtown Columbus theatre that  catered to kids and opened each summer season with this movie on a double feature with BLACKBOARD JUNGLE, another contemporary MGM blockbuster.<br /><br /> Today, it looks somewhat quaint, but is entertainingly nostalgic; not the classic that everyone says it is. The special effects were great for '56, and the animated monster and futuristic score were really impressive.  But a lot of it is pretty boring and talky.  I offers a good good look at Leslie Neilsen before he was the goofball comic in his later years.<br /><br />I have the laser disc, a high def version, and now the blu ray, all bought during sales over the past 20 years.  So, I'm a fan. just not a rabid one.
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|I loved this game when I played it on my computer so I downloaded it on my kindle fire.  Had fun for a short while and then my kindle froze and that was the end of the game.  I deleted it off my kindle. Graphics are awesome and its a wonderful game, just didn't want to risk causing issues with the kindle that I saved for.
0143038419|5.0|An amazing story! A personal favorite and one that you can read over and over and still learn something new.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I could not stop reading this. First night I read half and finished the rest in two days. Sorry to nit ha e read the first one, but loom forward to reading Mockingjay., and the movie.

B00CH3DBNQ|3.0|I have read 134 pages of 313 pages. I try to be objective in my thoughts about reading by sadly I'm not sure that I have the ambition to finish this book.  So far as I can gather it should have been named I'm Malalala's father or family.  The first few pages tells you that she got shot in the head because of her desire to go to school but after that it just keeps going into the story of how poor her grandfather was and couldn't send his son for education.  Her  mother was also illiterate.  I bought it with the express desire to know about Malalala and maybe a slight bit about her upbringing, but this is going on way too long.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|next best thing to the real thing. the only thing is being able to select colors for different priorities and functions
B000JQUKKU|2.0|Very weird and hard to understand. I just didn't like it at all.  I'll just stick to the movies on television.  Those variences are good.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I found this movie to be intriguing because it is different from the movies they have out now. I thought that it would be another movie with a storyline like the twilight movies. While the storyline did have a few things that were a little like parts of the storyline in other movies it was different in the rest of the aspects. While they trailers for the movie made it seem a lot more exciting than it actually is i really liked it. I have watched it at least 4 times because it always keeps me intrigued. It wasn't what i expected but was worth the money.
B001E6X4W0|5.0|Great story and forget how talented the actors are and have become. Reminds me how much I appreciate Anne Rice for her written work.
B001EBWING|5.0|Humphrey Bogart is my favorite actor of all time.  My most favorite movie is The African Queen but Casablanca is second.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My niece turned me on to this series and I was addicted after the very first episode.  Very entertaining and well done.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|It is just fantastic, well-paced for the most part, and amazingly well thought out.  Some of the adventure gets a little scattered and overly diverse which frays the narrative a bit and makes it feel disjointed at times, but it is still astoundingly good.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have nothing negative to say about this series.  I love it and can't wait till the next season becomes available to order.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|ALLEGIANT is the anticipated end to the Divergent series. Sometimes readers like me want every book to end with a fairy tale ending. This one ends with Tris being absolutely true to her character. It was interesting to see all the choices each character made throughout the series as events unfurled. If you really like dystopian literature,  this is a great series. I guess I was expecting more from the last book,  and thought things might end differently.  This author writes well, and I appreciate an author who understands sentence structure and variety. Great series.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I tried to make an in game puchase and it just took my money and didn't give me the items I purchased.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini writes so well that I can't put it down. I wish he had a new one coming. Thank you

I see a huge logic error here.

B00D23GXB2|5.0|Poetry With Emotion is exactly what Author G.P.A. gives you in this book of poetry. I must tell you I was surprised when I started to read a couple of the poems that it kept my interest! I'm a book reader - meaning I need a story line(good or bad)! But here's the thing..... these poems were mini stories!<br />There were a lot of moments when a lot of things mentioned, said or eluded to were so familiar to me. Who hasn't \\"Obsessed\\" over someone? You haven't looked at pictures on your phone or computer and it immediately made you think about them? Made your passwords or combinations from their initials, birthday and measurements... Yeah I know I'm not the only one..LOL.<br />I am obsessed with you.<br />And I know what you are thinking.<br />It is supposed to seem extreme.<br />It is supposed to come across as overkill.<br />It is supposed to make you feel a tad frightened.<br />If it were otherwise, it wouldn't be obsession.<br />I closed my eyes after I read \\"Chocolate, Powdered Sugar, and Strawberries\\" and I could smell the chocolate syrup, taste red strawberries. Then I read \\"Enough\\" and I was in that damn taxi..thank you so much and I mean that!!<br />Obelisk found freedom because she had pulled zipper down enough<br />Nowhere near a granite state, still brown skin turned purplish white vein protruded<br />prominently, so I was hard enough<br />Not on her knees, yet she was able to inhale and exhale, descend and ascend upon my appendage<br />showing she had room enough<br />Apex arrival had not yet, but eyes saw back, top, and front of brain, breath became scarce, and<br />tumescence began to make his appearance, signaling that I was close enough<br />G.P.A. shows us a glimpse of a man in touch with his emotions. Whoop Whoop! He shows us a trifecta from one poem to the next. Love, Lust, and even Fear. There is nothing like poetry to take your mind and body from one place to the next.<br />This author has found a way to do that in this Erotic Autobiography.<br />Buy this book of poems and enjoy the ride!
