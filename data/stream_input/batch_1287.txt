B005I6EU48|5.0|I based my purchase on the reviews written here and went ahead and purchased this cover for my new Fire.  The folks here are spot-on.  At first it seems like the cover might be too small, but it is NOT!  Simply snug your Fire in there and after a day or two the cover will lay down flat.  It is a lovely looking cover, too.  I got the red, which is a rich burgundy.  There is a small pocket in the inside front cover so slip a sheet of notepaper or whatever you want in there.  Despite the fact that it uses elastic bands to secure the Fire in the cover, this is a nice snug fit and I have no worries that it will fall out of the cover.  I've had several covers over the years for my old Kindle, but have to admit this is the best cover for any electronic that I've owned.  Well worth the price.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|These days, I'm simply thrilled to find an app that does what it says it will do.  Adobe allows me to read my PDF files on my Kindle Fire.  Yes, I know the Fire supports PDF and you don't need Adobe to view these files, but I don't care for the look of the PDF in \\"Kindle-mode\\" and it is much easier to copy portions of the PDF for my notes using Adobe.  If you're a student or someone who uses a lot of text PDF files, just having the Adobe app helps when the Kindle-version of that pdf comes up on the screen as blurry text.  Ugh.  The text is always clear using this small app.

0553801473|5.0|George R. R. Martin, &lt;strong>A Dance with Dragons&lt;/strong> (Bantam, 2011)<br /><br />It took seven years for George R. R. Martin to finish, and release, the long-awaited book five of A Song of Ice and Fire. (Longer, actually, as it was originally intended to be a part of &lt;em>A Feast for Crows&lt;/em>, so it's conceivable that some of the prose in this book is eleven years old.) And, let's face it, &lt;em>A Feast for Crows&lt;/em> was by far the weakest link in the series so far. So perhaps I was a little more reluctant to pick up &lt;em>A Dance with Dragons&lt;/em> than I would have otherwise been. In case you're a fan of the first three books who's been on the fence about it as well, I'm here to tell you that while this isn't &lt;em>A Storm of Swords&lt;/em>, it's absolutely a return to form for Martin.<br /><br />We pick up a number of threads we last read about in 2000 (probably not coincidentally, the threads most favored by fans); Tyrion's, Jon Snow's, and Dany's. We also get a couple of new threads, minor characters elevated to main character status, most notably Reek (whose identity remains a mystery until about halfway through the book, but you know him). Two-thirds of the way in, we pick up the threads from &lt;em>A Feast for Crows&lt;/em> as well, and get reacquianted with the rest of the Lannister clan, Arya, and a few others. As for the plot, if you've been reading along, you're well aware of it, though the action shifts from the War of the Five Kings (which seems to be petering out) to focus more on the east, with a number of prospective rulers realizing that gaining Dany Targaryen's alliance could mean the balance being tipped in their favor. Problem is, Dany has more than enough problems of her own.<br /><br />There's nothing I can tell you about &lt;em>A Dance with Dragons&lt;/em> that I didn't tell you about the first three books in the series. Fast-paced, action-packed, with excellent characters in interesting situations. It's wonderful, scurrilous, bawdy, majestic stuff, and if you haven't yet discovered it, give it a try. The books may look menacing (this is the second of them to top a thousand pages), but trust me, they're quick reads, and absorbing as all get-out. This is good stuff. **** ½currilous, bawdy, majestic stuff, and if you haven't yet discovered it, give it a try.

B000RIWAVW|4.0|&lt;strong>Halloween&lt;/strong> (John Carpenter, 1978)<br /><br />I was at Twelve Hours of Terror over the weekend, an awesome overnight horror movie marathon put on by a local cinema every year. Dave, the program director, sticks in a secret screening every year. (Last year's was &lt;em>Primal&lt;/em>, one of the most satisfying horror movies to come out of Australia in the past decade; viz. review 18Oct2010 ish.) He claimed not to have told a soul about this year's secret screening, and I overheard his co-host, a local radio movie critic, confirming that he had no ideas \\"but I have some suspicions!\\" while I was outside smoking between the night's first (&lt;em>Zombi 2&lt;/em>, review of the new restoration elsewhere this ish) and second (&lt;em>Humanoids form the Deep&lt;/em>, viz. review 18Feb08) films. I was expecting another \\"nobody in America has heard of this yet\\" relatively new film; I had actually convinced myself it was going to be &lt;em>Bellflower&lt;/em>, a 2011 feature that got raves at Fantasia (and whose poster appeared in the Capitol's lobby for three or four days earlier this month before being replaced with &lt;em>The Ides of March&lt;/em>). But when secret-movie time arrived, he still didn't tell us the title, just dimmed the lights... and we heard the opening notes of, arguably, the most famous theme in horror movie history.<br /><br />Yes, for the first time, I was seeing &lt;em>Halloween&lt;/em> on the big screen. I was only ten years old when it was originally released, and my parents were, ah, not big on horror films, so the only way I'd ever seen the blessed thing (and I realized partway through that I really haven't seen it all that often) was on a little TV. And, somehow, I had never reviewed it. And thus, here we are.<br /><br />If you've been living in a cave for thirty-one years, I'll tell you that &lt;em>Halloween&lt;/em> is the story of Michael Myers (played as a child by Will Sandin in his only screen appearance, and as an adult by &lt;em>Emerging Past&lt;/em>'s Tony Moran), who at the age of six butchered his older sister and was sent to a mental institution, where the good Dr. Loomis (the late, great Donald Pleasance) discovered him to be more force of evil than human being and attempted to keep him locked away for the rest of his life. Michael isn't having any of that, however. Fifteen Halloweens later, he breaks out of the nuthouse, steals a car, and drives back to Haddonfield to start killing teenagers who have premarital sex, while Loomis and the local sheriff (Carpenter regular Charles Cyphers) try to track him down.<br /><br />&lt;em>Halloween&lt;/em> is often thought of as the first American slasher film. I have long thought that was inaccurate, but I may be the one in error here; every slasher film I look up that came before that I thought was American turns out to have been made in Canada, including Bob Clark's &lt;em>Black Christmas&lt;/em>. (To the best of my knowledge, every other Clark film from &lt;em>Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things&lt;/em> to &lt;em>Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2&lt;/em> was an American production.) Still, my point does kinda stand that it's not like the slasher film was entirely unknown to Americans in 1978; &lt;em>Black Christmas&lt;/em> had enjoyed a very good theatrical run a few years previous, as had a number of horribly butchered Italian &lt;em>giallo&lt;/em> films; more violence was done to the American theatrical releases of those movies than to any of the killers' victims, however. (The most infamous example was Dario Argento's classic &lt;em>Profondo Rosso&lt;/em>, from which almost twenty minutes was cut, all of it plot and character development. I've seen that cut. It makes no sense whatsoever.) What is inarguable, though, is that &lt;em>Halloween&lt;/em> was the first slasher film to paint the serial killer as an icon. This was the first time anyone had hinted that there was anything supernatural going on in the background here (Loomis refers to Michael in supernatural terms more than once), and in some odd way, that caused film fans to connect with Michael Myers in a way they didn't with the villains to be found in earlier mad-killer pictures. (Three years later, there was &lt;em>Halloween II&lt;/em>, and the birth of the slasher-film cult-hero, and from then on, pretty much every American slasher film has tried to build a serial-killer brand like Myers, Jason Voorhees, or Freddy Krueger. And if you can name a half-dozen more, you're doing better than 99% of Americans... which tells you how successful most of them have been.) It's impossible to deny that &lt;em>Halloween&lt;/em> is one of the most important, influential films of the seventies in any genre; I'm not sure there's been a more important/influential horror film since &lt;em>Nosferatu&lt;/em>.<br /><br />But putting all that aside, how is it as a movie? In fact, I was quite surprised at how well it's aged. Aside from a couple of silly mistakes (Michael is credited as \\"Michael at 6\\" and \\"Michael at 23\\", when it's said a number of times that fifteen years have passed... supernatural, indeed!) and a number of pop-culture references that sound as fresh as week-old sourdough, &lt;em>Halloween&lt;/em> is straight-up timeless and placeless, the kind of movie that could take place anywhere, anytime. (Haddonfield, Illinois, of course, does not exist, but the county where it is supposed to be does; Livingston County is about halfway between Bloomfield and Chicago, and pretty much defines \\"middle of nowhere\\". A very good choice if you're going for timelessness/placelessness.) A very simple plot, interesting characters, hooks into their lives that are there for characterization. Imagine well-drawn complex characters in a slasher film! Carpenter also pulled in some pretty decent talent for his trio of lead actresses. First there was Jamie Lee Curtis in her big-screen debut (she'd done some television work previously), as believable as they come, if a little old for the role of high school student (Curtis was 20 at the time of filming). She was the film's big discovery, though she would be typecast as a scream queen until &lt;em>Trading Places&lt;/em> five years later. Flanking her were Carpenter regular Nancy Kyes (the only actress to appear in all of the first three Halloween films) and the gloriously ditzy PJ Soles, who had already had solid roles in a number of other flicks (including the infamous TV movie &lt;em>The Boy in the Plastic Bubble&lt;/em> and mega-horror-hit &lt;em>Carrie&lt;/em>). Add a couple of deeply cute kids (one being Kyle Richards, who would go on to a recurring character appearance in the long-running drama &lt;em>ER&lt;/em>, and Brian Andrews, a TV-movie vet whose child-star career would end in 1987), and you've got yourself a formula for big-screen success. Carpenter had already proved himself in the thriller realm with &lt;em>Assault on Precinct 13&lt;/em> and in the sci-fi realm with &lt;em>Dark Star&lt;/em> (though few people saw that until Carpenter got big), it was time to see what he could do with a horror movie. And my god, what he did with a horror movie. Box-office receipts smashed records, and repeat business was unprecedented. The &lt;em>Halloween&lt;/em> formula would be duplicated/ripped off/paid homage to/parodied dozens, if not hundreds, of times in the next seven years (often called the Golden Age of the Slasher Film). The \\"rules\\" of slasher films were set in stone here, and even now aren't often broken when someone makes a slasher film. And to top it all off, it's a barrel of fun to watch.<br /><br />But the thing that most impresses me about not only &lt;em>Halloween&lt;/em>, but that entire first trilogy of films, is that Carpenter was making them &lt;em>on his way up&lt;/em>. He was learning as he went, and he was not as good a director in 1978 as he was when he made the best movies of his career, an almost-unbroken string of box-office smash hits and critical successes that ran from 1982's &lt;em>The Thing&lt;/em> to 1988's &lt;em>They Live&lt;/em>. Even as a journeyman who hadn't yet become a master, Carpenter was capable of turning out one of the most popular, influential horror films of all time. That is an achievement indeed. ****m>Trading Places</em> five years later.

B001QVFDA4|1.0|I thought the movie played like a poor attempt to recreate Guy Richties better movies.  I couldn't even finish watching it.  The movie had a great looking trailer, but the actual film had no likeable or interesting characters and poor development.
B001N26GFC|1.0|&lt;strong>Happy-Go-Lucky&lt;/strong> (Mike Leigh, 2008)<br /><br />I guess I should probably start off with a warning that, despite the utter predictability of the climax of this film, the review does contain what could be construed as a major spoiler. Not that it matters, as you will have turned it off long before you get to that point, but still.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />I persist in the belief, for some reason I am quite incapable of figuring out, that Mike Leigh will eventually make a film that will not make me want to kill myself within five minutes of my starting to watch it. And so I continue to watch Mike Leigh movies. I'm sure my therapist is very happy with this arrangement. The most recent one to cross my path is &lt;em>Happy-Go-Lucky&lt;/em>, which was, inexplicably, nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (the movie was also written by Leigh). But then, &lt;em>Sideways&lt;/em> was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay as well, and that made just as little sense. And it WON!<br /><br />Plot: Poppy (&lt;em>Made in Dagenham&lt;/em>'s Sally Hawkins) is a 30-year-old preschool teacher living in London. The title of the film gives you a clue into her personality, albeit a quite understated one. Poppy is manic at her calmest times, stubbornly refuses to look at life in any sort of logical manner, and repeatedly puts herself into situations where, in the real world, she would be in imminent danger of losing her life. That all of this is glossed over (with the underlying \\"just let go of your worries and be happy-go-lucky and all will be right with your life!\\" message, which is of course a load of complete codswallop) is one of the defining points of the film. If you have no problems with that, and with Poppy's personality, you will probably like this. In any case, I digress. Thanks to Poppy's bike being stolen, she decides she needs to, at long last, learn to drive a car. The instructor assigned to her by the driving school is Scott (&lt;em>V for Vendetta&lt;/em>'s Eddie Marsan), who is Poppy's polar opposite in every way that's important (at least to the film). While Poppy's driving lessons are only one part of an ensemble piece, they quickly become the main focus of the film, culminating in... the most predictable opposites-attract storyline imaginable.<br /><br />Except that Mike Leigh can't even get THAT right. There is not one iota of indication anywhere in this film until Scott's big climactic blow-up that he is in any way attracted to Poppy (and to Leigh's ever-so-minor credit, that single fact is the only thing that makes Poppy's reaction during that scene even remotely acceptable). It's a climax without a storyline. Okay, I exaggerate a bit. There is one scene that gives it away, though it could also be interpreted as either \\"wow, creepy stalker dude!\\" or \\"hey, isn't it interesting that we live a block from one another?\\" (Which is how I interpreted it... right up until writing that last paragraph, actually.) But this is synecdochic of the entire film, which is filled with episodic set pieces that are supposed to be pregnant with importance (and, I'm sure, are supposed to tie back to the driving-lesson plotline). But here's the thing... they never are. This is an emperor who has no clothes at all. Why this continues to surprise me in the case of Mike Leigh is entirely beyond me. Perhaps, finally, I will give up after seeing this, an even worse film than &lt;em>Topsy-Turvy&lt;/em>. ½ery way that's important (at least to the film).

B0064NTZJO|3.0|People either love or hate this film, but I'm the strange one who feels both sides. On the positive side, it's beautifully filmed and paced. These aspects make parts of it like the Japanese \\"Shall We Dance\\", or a Wong Kai War's \\"In the Mood For Love\\", though the tension and dread have your stomach in knots already. The acting was strong and the music was wonderful, though I felt having the lyrics of \\"a real hero\\" blasted in my face did not work so well. On the not so positive side, this seemed like a typical violent revenge movie. Yes, I got that the Driver was closed emotionally and his neighbor and child brought out love feelings for him that he may not have understood, but for him kill everyone like a pro when things go wrong? The story seemed to indicate that the Driver was not a trained killer, but he sure knew how to dominate every time. In \\"First Blood\\", viewers had some idea of why Rambo took revenge and was alienated. However, in \\"Drive\\", we are supposed to believe that an introverted man will step up to help when he has feelings for a woman, and then become a sociopathic killer to \\"save the day\\". Not only that, but help the woman's obviously \\"in too deep\\" husband. Did anyone imagine the heist going well? While it was nice to have a somewhat ambiguous ending and long silent shots, the film when over-the-top in showing violence, letting us see extreme graphic detail. The upside of the violence is that it was very uncomfortable to watch, like real life, the downside is that it seemed like nothing to the characters. I'm sure the filmakers did all of the above on purpose to create a stylized \\"epic\\". The one thing that did not seem to make sense in the world the film created was the chase scene after the heist. Here we have the well-established amazing driver having no luck shaking the mobster car, though finally breaking away by what might have been luck or error by the mobster car. Watch \\"Drive\\" if your favorite films are \\"Scarface\\", \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", or similar. For the rest of us, it's a stylish nightmare.

0345479092|4.0|I thought this book had a very comforting middle-of-the-road approach to parenting.  I find that much of the information out there is at one extreme or another, and you are chastised by both sides if you don't believe what they believe.  The advice is very practical and, obviously, the reader should take what she says into consideration and do what works best for his/her baby.  Many reviewers were upset with her views on breastfeeding; I read the whole book and didn't feel she had a negative view of breastfeeding or was trying to convince anyone not to do it.  She brought up very real problems for some women and if you don't have these problems, great!  But some women, for one reason or another, are not able to breastfeed and shouldn't be made to feel guilty about it.  Just as with anything else, there might be one or two points you don't agree with, but that doesn't mean that this book is not worth reading.

Turisas is definitely my favorite artist in this genre, and they seem to get better with each album.    Favorite song: Hunting Pirates, the music is fun, and the lyrics present a compelling picture of privateers.  Least Favorite: Fear the Fear, not that it's bad, but just seemed a bit flat to me compared to the other songs.

0800141849|5.0|I'm not a huge Streisand fan, but she brings a transformation to life that we all can relate to on some level. Beau Bridges is amazing--he really connects and his character is likewise very believeable! The story itself is terrific and even believeable! There are many (re)affirming qualities concerning human nature and hope runs rampant in your heart as you watch the characters' relationship grow and develop. It is NOT all that predictable, although it will end as one might hope, with the best for all coming to pass.   The only change I'd recommend to the director is to cut the final scene--it goes over the top and becomes too \\"Hollywood\\" to  be credible in the real world. As the film director, I'd freeze the scene with the music playing in the background and let the credits roll--your imagination can create a better and more personal reality! I hope you enjoy the movie and that you are a better person because of it. \\"To thine own self be true!\\"

It's all forced, every situation is extreme and the dialogue is way over the top. I don't even know what to say to those that find this funny.  No pace, actors all mailed it in.

B0057VDGNK|5.0|Martinez is currently my favorite movie composer and this may be his best work. I still haven't heard Wicker Park. Infinitely better than the middling film it accompanies, Drive is the progeny of Kraftwerk, Pink Floyd and many others. Martinez does what the true greats do- he mixes great stuff you love into a stew of his own. Solaris is good. Underneath is great. Music perfect for the times - ambient, alienating, skittering, backwards, noisy. These are dark times for the arts and this music w/ much heart, reflects that.

B000IHJ2B8|4.0|First of all this movie is not pro-Taliban or pro-Al Qaeda  many people on here hate on this movie because Rambo joins the \\"Taliban\\"... This is very laughable because those people were Mujahadeens if you didnt know there are 3 different ethnic groups in Afghanistan Tajiks(Who were in the movie) Hazaras(Mongoloid people) and Pashtoons(Talibans)  these people in here assume that just because u are an afghan trying to defend ur country against the russians you are a \\"terrorist\\" or \\"taliban\\"  its also funny because this movie was set in the 1980's Taliban wasnt even formed until the 1990's.  JUST SHOWS HOW STUPID SOME PEOPLE ARE. AND HOW IGNORANT!  SHAME ON YOU!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Very enjoyable read. Is laugh outloud funny at times. Could easily be a Tv show. I love Oberon. Atticus the most often reluctant hero gets dragged into local supernatural politics to protect his interests. All the other characters are so much fun to read about and their escapades exciting you don't want to stop reading.

0553579908|4.0|I was introduced to George R.R. Martin through the HBO series, which prompted me to read [[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One]].  I liked it, so the next in the series was an enevitability.  There is much to like here (as the numerous 5 star reviews indicate) - however, I have some reservations.  First, what works here.  The complexity of the story is truly epic - the cast of characters rivals Tolstoy, but this provides a rich nuance and broad scope to the story.  The writing is very good - given so many different perspectives (and motives and personalities), Martin does a magnificent job of making each character wholly unique; the details are also engrossing, providing vivid clarity to the setting and action.  (The level of detail is a large part this saga weighs in at just over 900 pages.)  Yet I struggled with elements of the story.<br /><br />For such a broad epic, I had expected more action and less intrigue, rather than the other way around.  When Martin finally does get to the action (and such action!  A number of times I was suprised at the direction in which he took the story) it is fast paced, vivid and every bit worthy of the praise so many fans have written here.  Yet the set up for the plot points was so elaborate, it often times read as if it were a Rube Goldberg machine.  I hope and anticipate that some of this is part of the larger narrative, and I am patient with Martin given this understanding.  Nonetheless, it made for some laboious reading.  Another issue I had was time and space between narrative perspective.  Given such magnificent detail and such a large array of characters, it infrequently became a challenge to keep track of the cast, and who was doing what the last time you read their part in the story line.<br /><br />These criticisms aside, I was captured by Martin's storytelling, and I will certainly read the remainder of the books in the saga.  Some reviewers took issue with the \\"magic\\" (and its role) in the story - I found the small part it played fit very well in the universe Martin had created: with the \\"return\\" (if that is the right word to use) of dragons, so too do other \\"magical\\" elements return - a brilliant concept, and one that not only works well in the story, but one that is evenly and gradually developed - again, back to the strength and attention to detail of Martin's writing.  Readers who enjoyed Tolkein's saga will especially enjoy Martin's series, although they share little in common.  Recommended.d the small part it played fit very well in the universe Martin had created: with the \\"return\\" (if that is the right word to use) of dragons, so too do other \\"magical\\" elements return - a brilliant concept, and one that not only works well in the story, but one that is evenly and gradually developed - again, back to the strength and attention to detail of Martin's writing.

B005ZUR724|1.0|I am very disappointed. When I decided I wanted the Kindle Fire I researched apps and this looked to be the coolest game app and it was. However, I only got around two days to play it before it said needed an update. I tried uninstalling then reinstalling, but nothing worked. So I spent a $1 just to play this game for 2 days to me that is not fair. I really liked this game the days I played it so I hope they fix it (then perhaps it may get 5 stars).

0439023521|5.0|This was a gripping book. While it is referred to as \\"teen fiction\\" I think one can use the term \\"teen\\" loosely; while it might be geared toward a younger age bracket, adults will certainly enjoy it as well. It's well-written with an excellent plot, and the themes are certainly very adult (e.g. rebelling against big brother, human rights, the role of violence). I read the entire series in two days; you absolutely cannot put them down.   That said, it's obviously not a universally appealing book. The same themes that make the novel thought-provoking are upsetting, and the action that makes you unable to put them down will not appeal to all. Collins kills characters, which isn't easy. But she does so for the advancement of the plot and to make the grim dystopia more threatening and tangible. The violence is neither gratuitous nor over the top, given the premise of the series. I generally don't like violent stories, but found these very compelling. They'll leave you emotionally drained and hungering for more. I would recommend parental judgement be used if younger teens want to read these.  A brief introduction: This is set in a future, dystopian North America in the nation of Panem. There are twelve districts ruled by the Capitol. At some point in the past, they and a thirteenth district rebelled. The Capitol triumphed and destroyed the thirteenth district. As punishment and a reminder of their subservience, each of the twelve must send one boy and one girl (ages 12-18) as tribute to the Capitol each year to participate in the \\"Hunger Games.\\" The tributes are placed in an arena made to look like some ecosystem (it could be a desert, jungle, tundra, anything) and have fight to the death. These games are televised and serve as \\"entertainment.\\" The victor is sent home wealthy. The districts range in affluence. The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is from the very poor District 12 that mines coal. This places District 12 tributes at a disadvantage, as they possess no fighting skills and are often malnourished.  Katniss is a feisty, likeable heroine. She and the other characters are well-developed. Collins is an excellent writer who successfully combines action with character development and dry humor. I highly recommend these books; you won't be able to put them down!  Katniss is a resourceful sixteen-year-old who often breaks the law to sneak under a fence and hunt in the woods, which is forbidden. She must do this to survive, as her father was killed years ago in a mining accident. This caused her mother to become depressed, and the burden of providing for her mother and sister, Prim, fell to Katniss. She became a successful hunter and gatherer, skilled with a bow. She loves Prim more than anything. When tributes are chosen, Prim is nervous. Katniss comforts her, telling her that since she is only 12, her name is only in the lottery once, and she is unlikely to be chosen. Unfortunately, she is. At this, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  She is then flung into a world in which she must dress and act a certain way to gain support and sponsors, who may pay to ease her way in the Games. Advised only by a former victor from her district, the perpetually drunk Haymitch Abernathy, she must learn quickly. Along the way, she gets to know her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark. She becomes close to her stylist, Cinna, who is a source of support and wisdom for her.  As she and Peeta spin tales of love to gain sympathy, Katniss must decide whose feelings are real and fake. And in the arena, she must fight to survive. The choices she makes change her, and ultimately affect all of Panem.

B005MYEPXC|2.0|Nice scenes of Paris. I've never been there. Heard so many great things about this movie. I found it to be boring and sterile. Owen Wilson does whine a lot, and comes off as be an uninspiring, one dimensional, and wimpy figure. Within minutes of the opening of the film, Allen's \\"neurosis\\" pops out. It's the same old stuff - nothing really matters after all because everyone dies. World without hope or, in this film, struggling to find it. How many times can you beat a dead horse (no pun intended)? Allen needs to finally discover a higher power rather than resorting to fawning over notable, but always, defective mortals. The lost detective scene was the only rewarding moment in the entire film. Bring back Bananas.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|I finished this second book to the Fifty Trilogy and yes, I'm still very much in LOVE with Ms. James' writing throughout the entire this book. Same as with the first book, this one was moving, intense, romantic, it made me cry, made me laugh, made me dream, sigh, made me fan myself (super-hot people), WOW! These two books so far have made the sensitive subject of BDSM far less intimidating by putting it in center stage of an explosive relationship between two very likeable and loveable characters. Ms. James did such a phenomenal job developing the leads. Their relationship evolved wonderfully throughout the two books so far without feeling rushed or unfinished. I really like the pace that Ms. James has to her writing and I can't wait for book number three. If judging by books one and two, I know that book three is going to be another exhilarating, can't put down, hold onto the edge of my chair, jump with joy, ride from the first page to the last. Thank you so very much E.L. James for writing and sharing such a wonderful story with all of us. I have added these books to my special list aptly named \\"Books I Love\\" because chances are that I will re-read them again and again in the years to come.

0786958731|5.0|I own all three of the D&D board games and this one is easily the best yet. The abilities are more fun, the playable heroes finally branch out somewhat from the tired old standard classes, there are eight playable heroes instead of five, and the new team challenge adventures and betrayal adventures are great additions to the rules. I also like that the rock walls look jagged and organic: the straight-line sameness of the dungeons in the previous two games made the environments dreary and boring.   My only complaint is that there are too few challenging monsters: these heroes and items are a lot more powerful - frequently granting the ability to reliably deal 2 damage per turn - and the 1-hp goblin monsters never stay on the board longer than 1 turn. Owners of Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon can remedy this by adding more challenging monster cards and figurines from those games - the Cave Bear and the Gargoyle come to mind.  I do think that \\"Legend of Drizzt\\" is an inappropriate name. Having played a half-dozen adventures in this game I can confidently say that Bruenor Battlehammer is the star of this show, and that nothing, nothing at all in any of the D&D Adventure System board games, can compare to the moment when he deals the killing blow to a dragon or a balor with his \\"headbutt\\" ability. Especially if he himself is at 1 HP at the time of use.  Because of this, my friends and I have affectionately renamed the King of Mithral Hall \\"Headbutts McGee,\\" and we have dubbed this game \\"The Ballad of Headbutts McGee\\"  Dude will headbutt anything. And then it will die. I'm not even kidding.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|We have a ten year old Radio Shack wireless TV headset with RCA connectors. We just bought a new Panasonic plasma 50\\" 3D HD TV and<br />the new TV only has optical audio output. Took a chance and bought this neat converter (purchased an optical to optical cable separately from<br />amazon basics). Took me 30 minutes to hook everything up (I'm slow and dumb with electronics), but when I turned on the antique<br />headphones, they worked perfectly with the new TV! If all my cables behind the new TV had been neat and sorted, I probably could have<br />installed this great little gizmo in 10 minutes.

B00402FGEE|5.0|I wasn't a huge Stargate fan until I started watching this show. I had seen some Stargate Atlantis prior to watching this series, but that was just about all I knew of the Stargate genre. That being said, the Stargate Universe series is exceptional and quickly turned into one of my all time favorite shows. I am very sad that there were only two seasons, and extremely unsatisfied with how they ended the second season. I hope they bring it back sometime so the legacy can continue.
0525423656|5.0|I don't know that I would really call this book a sequel to the story, but rather a bridge of what is to come. Crossed is action packed and full of suspense. I loved the new characters that were brought in. Indie, the reserved and strong red haired girl who escapes with Cassia, Vick the strong leader with secrets of his own, and Eli the kid who resembles Bram too much to be left behind. I am dying to see what happens next. Though now that I have hopes for each character, I pray I'm not disappointed!<br /><br />This was a great installment in the series. You learn a bit more about each of the main players and even thought Xander isn't physically present in the Outer Provinces, the author found a way to remind you he is still very much a stronghold in Cassia's heart. To be completely honest, I started reading this book and finished all in one day. I couldn't put it down. The story is told alternating between Cassia and Ky's point of view, a unique look at each of their circumstances and thought processes.<br /><br />Mrs. Condie is true to form with her poetic and free flowing writing style. There is so much wonderment and awe in this book as the characters are taken to new places and experience the beauty of nature on a whole new level. I think all too often this series is compared to Hunger Games when really it is a completely different beast. Something simple, beautiful, and full of life- Love in its simplest form and the consequences and reactions created when choices are made.
0803731094|5.0|All I will say is get this book.  My nearly 3 1/2 year old got it for Christmas and loves it.  We have an absurd number of books in our house (many of them I would say are very, very good), and my husband and I (and my daughter) think this may be the best and most clever.  We enjoy all of Julia Donaldson's books.  My husband's first favorite was \\"Room on the Broom\\" at Halloween.  Now he loves \\"The Gruffalo\\" as well as Donaldson's \\"Charlie Cook's Favorite Book\\".  \\"Stickman\\" was pretty cute for the Christmas season as well.  Daughter loves them all.  Great author.

B005974CDU|4.0|Like some of their best albums, \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" is both creative (i.e., takes the band in some new directions) while building on Dream Theater's familiar sounds and strengths. Petrucci took a clear lead on this album and crafted several masterpieces.   It would have been fun to hear Mangini make a powerful entrance and excel on this album, but my understanding is that most of the songwriting was done before he won his position. The drumming is great, but not consistently creative; you get the feeling he didn't have quite enough room under the circumstances to blow listeners away. It's interesting that the drums are mixed a little more quietly than Portnoy's were (or than Portnoy ever allowed his drumming to be, I suspect).  The main thing that prevented me from giving the album a five-star rating was that after several listens, the gentler songs generally have not gripped me like the harder songs on the album have.
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you are like me and hate going to the gym, then you have to get this DVD. It is a hard workout, but that is why it is so effective. I have tried a lot of workout DVDs, and this is by FAR the most effective one that is under 30 minutes. I just don't have time to do a longer workout, so this is perfect for me. I notice results fast, too, which keeps me motivated to keep doing it. This DVD is the reason I was able to lose all 45 pounds of baby weight in 6 months. Don't even think twice, buy this DVD and commit to doing it three times a week. You will not be sorry. If you want to see results in a 25 minute workout, this is really your only option.

B000HT3PPG|4.0|John Payne and Maureen O'Hara manage to prove that an old and bearded codger, Edmund Gwenn, who has been hired by Macy's Department Store in New York to play Santa Claus during the Christmas season, is actually Santa Claus, aka Kris Kringle. Natalie Wood is the skeptical little daughter of divorced O'Hara. Payne is a lawyer who works at a white shoe firm.<br /><br />  This will warm the cockles of your heart. It ends happily, with Payne and O'Hara finding each other and Wood won over to a belief in Santa Claus, or at least the power of will.<br /><br />  There are a few minor problems. I found out there was no Santa Claus early in life, around the age of thirty-five, when I took a look at my first paycheck. And later, when I tried to plead not guilty by reason of mental defect. And, as if that weren't enough, a few weeks into my marriage was enough to convince me. We might as well face head on the fact that life is full of pain. Every realist knows this. The doctor even slaps the newborn baby, except in the case of more than usually ugly babies when he slaps the mother.<br /><br />  No. I'm afraid O'Hara and her daughter may have had the right take on life as materialists. Our lives are determined by our circumstances or, as the famous philosopher Brillat-Savarin put it, \\"Dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es.\\" I don't know what it means but it sounds as if it had to do with some kind of material.<br /><br />  Now, John Payne is a hoax of a different color. Unable to recognize an epiphenomenon when he sees one, he insists that fantasies are essential to our lives. He doesn't explain why. He just assumes it, with a snap of his mental fingers.<br /><br />  He quits his job at a prestigious New York law firm in order to defend Santa Claus in court. Right. And where is John Payne now, you ask? I recently saw him wrapped in a couple of filthy blankets on a bench in Sheridan Square. Don't try to kid a kidder.<br /><br />  Edmund Gwenn does a fine job in the role but he isn't Santa. Edmund Gwenn, as a matter of fact, is a psychopath who tried to push the innocent reporter Joel McCrea off the tower of a London church in \\"Foreign Correspondent.\\" Now he shows up as Santa Claus and we're asked to believe him? In this enshrinement of idealism, he sucks poor little Natalie Wood into his fantasy world of reindeer and North Poles and ritual reciprocity and all that. I won't deny that, fifteen years after this release, Natalie Wood began to play a part in my fantasy life too -- but what does that have to do with the venomous message this movie propounds? Nothing at all -- and let's get our minds out of the gutter, shall we?<br /><br />  The lissotrichous Maureen O'Hara is attractive, polite but tough as carbon steel underneath all that winsome pulchritude. Well, maybe not so hard in the end. Maureen O'Hara might be spirited if the role called for it but never tough.is a psychopath who tried to push the innocent reporter Joel McCrea off the tower of a London church in \\"Foreign Correspondent.\\" Now he shows up as Santa Claus and we're asked to believe him?

B005OK722U|2.0|A few weeks ago in my review for \\"Wrong Turn 4\\" I mentioned how horror fans are willing to watch just about anything. They live and die in the horror genre. \\"Sure \\"Wrong Turn 3\\" sucked but 4 has to be at least a little bit better...right?\\" It doesn't matter how many awful sequels we get, we are more than willing to watch another one. The same is true for direct-to-dvd horror. Mostly just franchises the studios realize they can no longer make money at the cinemas with, they cut the budget, release it on dvd, and watch the profits come in.<br /><br />Case in point, today's entry in the direct-to-dvd horror sequel lottery, \\"Hostel: Part III.\\" I will confess that I was not the biggest fan of the original \\"Hostel.\\" I found the characters to be obnoxiously shallow and its 45 minutes of nudity mixed with 45 minutes of gore just didn't sit well with me. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised by just how good \\"Hostel: Part II\\" was. It took all of the mistakes about the first one (unlikable characters, no villain backstory, too much nudity) and turned out to be a delicious black comedy with a perfect ending. Now, we have \\"Hostel: Part III.\\" Does it live up to the expectations set by the second entry or does it die trying like the original?<br /><br />\\"Hostel: Part III\\" begins with a fake out that is actually pretty ingenious. A young man is brought back to a hotel room by a slutty blond stripper and her beefy, bald boyfriend. One thing leads to another and two of them end up drugged and taken away. To say which two would ruin the surprise. Next, we have a group of four friends attending a bachelor party in Las Vegas. These characters are the typical beer guzzling, horny jocks that have become standard place in most horror movies and comedies today. Seriously it is that hard to write likable characters? I guess so. Okay, not off to a good start and we are only fifteen minutes into the movie. The overgrown frat boys are enticed by two sexy escorts to join them at a private party off the Strip. Because, as we all now, whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Once there, they are horrified to find themselves the subjects of a perverse game of torture, where members of the Elite Hunting Club are hosting the most sadistic show in town.<br /><br />Blah, blah, blah. \\"Hostel: Part III\\" brings nothing new to the torture table besides a few half-hearted twists and some lame deaths. What is the point in watching a \\"Hostel\\" film if nearly ALL of the deaths occur off screen? Not only that, but the few deaths that we actually do get to see are ruined by awful CGI. Note to filmmakers, CGI is easier and cheaper but note that easier and cheaper doesn't always mean better. The final twist in the last five minutes is just insulting. Think of it as a maggot on the top of a rancid ice cream sundae. Skip it.ecause, as we all now, whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

I was dreading the thought of having to watch another \\"sing and dance\\" movie with endless catchy songs.<br /><br />This film turned out to be fun.  It has lovely story line from one of the fairy tales and plenty of action.  It is great for both boys and girls.  Adults will not be left behind, they will enjoy this film just as much.
B00428LIXO|3.0|This toy is a great idea for those babies who love slamming things into the floor. Noises are fun and colors are great. But, it's too heavy for my 8 month old to hold and pound himself. He can hold it (and chew on it) but cannot lift it up and down to make the noises himself. B
B0063IH60K|5.0|great gameplay and graphics . I could play this game again and again and again ana again and again an one more thing this game is.awesome
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game it relaxes me end of long day. Recommend this for all ages. Go get it for yourself. I am having trouble getting 20 words for review.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I just bought a Spyderco Tenacious on this web site and managed to wear down the blade pretty quickly in some hard-use tasks at work. This sharpener put a nice edge back on the blade with just a few passes through the ceramic element. I didn't need the carbide element at all. I recommend it. Sweet knife too, by the way.

0811879542|5.0|Opening the pages of Press Here a child enters into an imaginative world filled with dots of all colors and sizes, but it all starts with a simple yellow dot. As pages are turned and actions completed the dots come to life before a child's eyes. Turn the book, shake the book and even blow on the dots in the book and listen to the laughter poor into your home as children & adults everywhere fall in love with this ingenious little picture book.<br /><br />Again, as I was with both Dot by Patricia Intriago and Lots of Dots by Craig Frazier I simply wasn't expecting what I would inevitably get out of these brilliant books. In each reading situation I completely underestimated the potential these books had and I'm incredibly thankful that Littlebug shared them with me. As each came into our home it was Littlebug that made the discoveries and opened her imagination to each book's pages. As we sat to read them together you could see the world light up in her eyes and I absolutely love when that happens!<br /><br />Press Here by Herv&eacute; Tullet was the first of these types of interactive books that we read and as I mentioned, it was a huge hit! Specific to Press Here the things we most enjoyed about it were the bright colors, the interactivity and the kiddos couldn't get enough of \\"having to\\" start over at the last page. What stood out in my mind was the level of interactivity and the way it's incorporated. Just when you think you've had enough \\"pressing\\" Tullet changes it to \\"turning\\" or \\"shaking\\". The timing is beyond perfect. Just when you think they will stop laughing and get bored kiddos turn the page and find another aspect to laugh about as if the dots have actually come to life!<br /><br />Dive into a world of creativity, imagination, and interactivity as you open the pages of Press Here by Herv&eacute; Tullet with a child you love. Watch as their faces light up and your home fills with laughter as they discover what their actions will cause the dots to do and become. This is without a doubt a favorite read of ours this year and one that gets read on a near daily basis in our home. If you haven't read Press Here by Herv&eacute; Tullet yet you are certainly missing out and I'd highly recommend you run out and pick up a copy as soon as you possibly can! You and the child you share it with won't be disappointed!<br /><br />Originally reviewed and copyrighted at my site, There's A Book.read of ours this year and one that gets read on a near daily basis in our home.

B0065GG2ZK|5.0|Seriously, I love this boy's sh--. He just makes me cry a lot. I put his CD on and I think about all the things in my life. All my talks with mama, some of my problems with girls, and then some of the problems I have with girls. Sometimes when I listen to him I even think about some of the problem I have with girls. He has made me a more in touch baller and I absolutely love him to death for that. We all tryin to make a dollar out fifteen cents and this boy has done did his thing with swagaliscious swaggah, yuhh. I hope to hear more chart-topping songs that make me cry. It's good to cry sometimes. It makes you more human. Not everybody out there has to pimp and deal to be a respected hip hop artist. C'mon, honestly, who the hell wants to hear 50 and his ilk anymore. I can honestly say there isn't one bad track on this album. I have the KLEENEX beside me all day at work. People see me crying at the office and just walk on by my cubicle going, \\"There he is listening to Drake again.\\" AND PROUD OF IT, CHUCHI!!!! Anyway, how is it this cat (who makes me cry and has me wondering about my manhood) hasn't won a golly gosh darnet Grammy already? Wasn't it some singer that said Try A Little Tenderness. Or was that my history teacher? Anyway... Take Care is an achievement and I hope these thick headed listeners get it. Even a baller needs to shed a tear sometimes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is do much fun! I love how you can decide what kind of &quot;deal&quot; you get. it doesn't even matter if you win or lose. this is just a fun game.
B006G2NVCA|2.0|Moody. To get Trent Raznest and Ati cuss thrown on your lawn like just before Christmas by the mailman and all that goodness and everything. I was like, \\"don't piss on yourself\\". So the score, yea : it was like so moody and stuff. When I got it I was a little scared cuz it was on my lawn and my father almost ran over it with his lawnmower. Crazy bun scary and stuff. So the score was like moody. I got cold listening to it. I was so excited to get the score cuz like it was trent resneck and atticu and yeah. So the score was like real moody and how you take the score depends on your mood at the time. If your in a good mood, its a good soundtrack. But if your in a bad mood, its a bad mood soundtrack. The dreamy vocals are to die for. It was so different from, ya know, stuff Im used to like Drake and Niel Diamond. Don't skip on the Di, yo. So yea, the score was moody and it really did not work for me. I wasn't in a bad mood or nothin. It just wasn't good for me. Turns out it was too moody and stuff.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Evanescence had me right away with \\"Fallen.\\" The goth/emo subject matter is not my style but the sound -- Amy's voice in contrast to the crunching guitars and booming beat -- overcame that. I was a little disappointed with \\"The Open Door\\" at first due to its more low-key overall sound, until I saw Amy playing some of the songs on the piano on some TV show, which really brought it into perspective.  So I was not sure what to expect with the new album. Would it be a return to the style that made them big? Or would it be a further progression in the direction of \\"The Open Door?\\" I was happy to find it really is a little of both.  The opening track, \\"What You Want,\\" provided the first surprise and sets the tone for the rest of the album. The beat, the guitars, the drums all point back to \\"Fallen\\" at the start, and then there's the little surprise key shift that completely changes the tone to something lighter just at the time that the lyrics turn a little darker.  It's a formula repeated over and over - take the best parts of Fallen and mix in some of the musical advances from Open Door, then add something new, and end up with something that is surprisingly better than what came before. The lyrics are still about as dark as ever but the music is lighter -- just a tad and just in places -- and more complex.  I think it's a great combination though I can see how it would disappoint people who really have strong feelings preferring one past album over another.  I have found \\"What You Want\\" to be my second favorite track - \\"My Heart Is Broken\\" is my favorite and it's great played at high volume. The deluxe edition is well worth it since it probably has the other 3 of the best 5 songs -- \\"Say You Will\\" topping the list, with a more mainstream rock sound and theme.  I often skip the slow songs (Lost in Paradise, Swimming Home, Secret Door) just because I'm not in the mood, but they are definitely good.  At times they venture close to the land of self-parody (The Other Side, End of the Dream) but we can love that too (and I do).  The piano and drums in this album are great - especially the drums. The drums are treated as an actual instrument rather than a fancy metronome and really add to the music. I hope they keep going in this direction with even more complexity.  In another review someone mentioned compression. I have to concur that it sounds that way to my untrained ears, but really it suits the audience so we have to live with it and it doesn't really bother me the way it bothers some people.  I saw the non-deluxe version in the store and was surprised it was in a jewel case - I hate the cardboard sleeve of the deluxe!
B005ZHB84U|5.0|I was so hard up with emotion when I heard this soundtrack. It made me feel so many things I hadn't known were there. Sure, there is much mystery as its a darker score than the previous, BUT I almost squeezed myself when I heard it. There so much romantic tension (if not something more) dripping off this thing its almost obscene. I found myself almost giggling like a little school girl when this brooding soundtrack walked into my life. Game changing score, seriously. At times I was scared. At times I laughed. At times I felt I was having an actual conversation with the soundtrack. I don't know if this is one of the best of the year but it has to be on top. Hans pushes and pulls on the familiar main theme, and at times he gushes with dark passion on some of the newer more mysterious elements. Through that he manages to squirt life into the soundtrack and gives it the necessary pep so that you don't fall asleep afterwards. You can tell he worked long and hard on this and injected just the right amount of \\"shadow\\" the film required. He must have been exhausted after this effort. Well done.
B00632HWOG|1.0|could and should be so much better for kindle fire. c'mon people! you can not see al of your emails!
B006FE17Q6|2.0|Even more time at the farm, and more boring conversations. I don't mind dialogue and I certainly don't need non-stop action to enjoy a show, but the second season dialogue in Walking Dead is unbelievably dull. You watch it and have the feeling that the writers are just trying to fill up time so they don't have to film any expensive zombie crowd scenes. Thus the blond girl and the old guy, for example, have about one predictable head-to-head an episode. These scenes aren't particularly dramatic, and they don't seem to deepen our knowledge of the characters or move the plot forward: they just seem to be taking up time. The point is that sure, the show LOOKED a lot better when Frank Darabont was more involved (and the budget was bigger), but more importantly, there weren't these pointless dull pseudo-emotional conversations. The show was better dramatically, too. There is a good surprise in this episode, but the show continues on the downward slide it's been on the whole second season.

B005CA4SQK|5.0|it's a nice pack I really enjoy the season, it's a really nice set. waiting for the season 2 pack
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Great movie, got here on time and in tact. No problem with sender. They even suggested other movies I may want to see. Completly satisfied.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I was amazed on the great deal that I got this for.It was a Christmas gift for my niece and she was so very excited when she opened the gift
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so fun can play it for hours except for the ads those are a real pain in the neck. so many games...
B0052UZIFA|3.0|could be awesome. update it already! Never can play for more than fifteen minutes before it crashes. Loses progress. please fix soon.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|one upside is there is so much you can do. a downside is you have to get points to unlock new games.
0865478570|4.0|Although, as a professional translator for 30+ years, I can't endorse all of Prof. Bellos' opinions, anyone with the cojones to take Nabokov to task for at least some of his insufferably prescriptive dicta on translation and to politely refrain from drooling over Pevear and Volokhonsky is OK with me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! I could not put it down! The story is very well thought out and flows well!  If you want a good read.... this book is it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Sol is always a great game to kill time with. I like that you canny turn it to suit your mood.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Got this cover for my valued Kindle Fire, which is awesome and even more awesome, and it has already been tested when I dropped the Fire off the table.  No damage done.  It sits up nicely for reading and playing games in wide screen.  Do wish however that there was a way of sitting it upright since I read better that way.  Over all it is a great product.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|went and saw the movie in the theaters. really enjoyed it. thought it was a good telling of how hal jorden got his powers. they did a superb job in choosing the cast.
B003Y5H542|5.0|Good order. Great packaging, because the Blu-ray arrived without damage. The price I paid was very good. I recommend buying on Amazon, no doubt.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun I couldn't. stop intal a week u unlock games or parts its like the game never end.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Good order. Great packaging, because the Blu-ray arrived without damage. The price I paid was very good. I recommend buying on Amazon, no doubt.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Works great for organizing.  Although I am wondering if there is a way to disable sorting by date (if you tell it otherwise it will sort all the notes of each day by that, not every single one).
B00164CM46|5.0|Good order. Great packaging, because the Blu-ray arrived without damage. The price I paid was very good. I recommend buying on Amazon, no doubt.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Hooked up the Zoom to my Kinect. So far..so good!  I have a very narrow living area, (about 13ft wide)so the Kinect was originally on the wall above our wall-mounted TV. When we \\"attached\\" the Zoom, we moved it to below the TV as per the instructions. We re-calibrated the Kinect and started playing!  I am very happy with the Zoom. Before we couldn't play any of the games without moving the tables and chairs and still had to bounce against the wall opposite the Kinect. Plus we always had to roll up our area rug so it would see our feet. No worries there either!
B005URRCUY|5.0|Excellent album.  Probably not quite as good as the previous one, but still very excellent.  They appear to be picking up a bit of a Motown sound in some of their songs.  I hope they don't evolve too much more away from the garage sound.
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|I purchased this item as I have recently purchased a Blu-ray player and wanted to see if the Blu-ray version would be noticeably different than the standard DVD version (which I already owned). The quality of the sound and picture on the Blu-ray was above and beyond the DVD version. The Harry Potter films are definitely worth purchasing on Blu-ray to better appreciate them. I don't automatically purchase movies on Blu-ray, but the elements of the Harry Potter films really stand out on the Blu-ray versions. I would recommend anyone who hasn't purchased the Harry Potter films on Blu-ray (even if you already own the DVD versions) to pick them up. You won't be sorry.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Probably the best thing King's written in years. Still, he writes too fast and needs a better editor...the book could have lost a third of its size and been a better work for that.<br />I'm not a devotee of the JFK assassination but feel that Lee and Marina Oswald were not fully realized as characters...perhaps that's to be expected but they were a little disappointing.<br />Other than these 'quibbles' this was an excellent book...well worth the time it took to read it.
B005K17RU0|1.0|tried suggestions in other reviews to no avail.  got some of the interface to surface but would not function properly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this is cool &amp; fun for fast games &amp; recommend it to anybody that likes playing games. My 2 yr old little girl loves playing some of the games on it as well!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Just got my mixer. It shipped swiftly and i love it! Just wanted to have some kind words for Behringer. Cop this.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this app. I had a similar program that I used about 2 years ago and it was ok at best. I decided to try this app because it was reduced in price. I am so glad I did. I use it on my droid bionic to browse while im away from home. (I cant lie, I use it to access my farm on farmville) I love this program so much that i added it to my ipad2. I have not had any app crashes yet and I use it all the time. It was easy to set up and find on both home network and cell network. I went to the developer site and found they had other apps, unfortunately their others do not support android. However if you have iphone/ipad/itouch, they have a camcam program that allows you to remote view your pc webcam and audio. Last there is also free program that lets you use your apple product as a touchpad/keyboard for your pc.   I love this app from splash top, keep an eye out for other programs they may offer.
B00632HWOG|5.0|wished every mail app did imap as well as this one. i have tried six or seven email apps and this was the best
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good way to kill time. games are pretty fun and easy to learn. lots of games for the bored
B005ZUR724|4.0|There is No update for this game, which makes it Unplayable!  will change this review when the problem is fixed!  New:  The update was applied and after a week without it, I would have to say that overall I am fairly pleased with this game.
0439023513|3.0|After reading this book, I never knew a book could bring me to so many tears at once. This book has hurt me so bad emotionally and can for anyone else. The author is sick. From killing children to people being burned alive. This is the worst book I have ever read, it is so very cruel and very heartbreaking in so many ways. Almost everyone Katniss has loved dies in this book. Prim dies trying to save other kids that were blown to pieces and she wasn't even 14 years old. She chose Peeta and never sees Gale again pretty much. Peeta is worthless in this book, he's just psycho.  I will not ever suggest this book to anyone ever.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am having lots of fun playing this game.  It's easy to use and the graphics are good.  It movesvery quickly.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I selected this app to access my WD media hub and play mkv movies. No luck.  In fact, none of the other formats played as well.  Photos worked a bit better but still has a bit to go. All the files displayed well as thumbnails, but, when the image is selected, you only have the resolution of the thumbnail magnified, horrible on kindle fire. I suspect it gives an acceptable picture on an Android phone.  Audio had'nt been tested.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|this was my daughters favorite Christmas present.  I got it for the best price I have seen.  It is hard to find and Amazon had it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game because they are simple and fun to play. I wish they are more games like this.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I did not care for this adaptation of Pride & Prejudice.  I think it impossible to do P&P any kind of justice in 2 hours.  I felt that they tried too hard to pack the story into too short a time.  They glossed over, skipped and condensed too many events that, in my opinion, were essential to the build up of the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy.  You get no sense of Darcy's struggle with his attraction.  You barely get any sense of his attraction at all.  Overall, I am left with a sense of meh.
B005XI9456|1.0|Is this really all the music industry can come up with these days?  Pretty faces with absolutely no talent or soul to the music and absolutely  zero musical ability.

B004A8ZWXS|2.0|MOVIE NOTE #18 WAR HORSE<br />Steven Spielberg, for me, is one of the quintessential directors of this century - having been the reason for six of the top ten films of all time - all of which are my favorites (`E.T.-The Extraterrestrial', `Jaws', `Schindler's List', `Jurassic Park', ` Raiders of the Lost Ark' - but - like a couple of his other films (`Empire of the Sun' & `War of the World') this movie fell short for me. The last 20 minutes of the film, although reminiscent of `Gone With The Wind' and `The Wizard of Oz', are amazingly touching in the Spielbergian way - but the rest f the two hours....yawn. With a lot of long shots, a lot of green-screens and a lot of `what's this story about', going on in my head...I was disappointed.<br /><br />Starring a relatively unknown cast it's the story of a young man (Jeremy Irvine of BBC TV's `Life Bites') meeting, gaining and growing up with `Joey' a beautiful thoroughbred horse with a distinctive white marking on its head. His mother and father (Emily Watson of `Corpse Bride' and `Red Dragon' and Peter Mullan of `Braveheart' and `Trainspotting') having a small farm and WWI looming around the corner end up selling this horse to the British war efforts. This same horse ends up being a surviving `hero' and helping, loading and lifting the spirits of various aspects of what WWI did to the English countryside families and their homes.<br /><br />There are some really great scenes, especially between a German soldier and a British soldier trying to free Joey from an incredibly filmed escape scene where the horse literally runs through barbed wired fences and traps himself. Amazing stunt work in this sequence.<br /><br />All-in-all it ends in the Spielbergian way that's obviously meant to grab yoru heartstrings - however - it is a little clich&eacute; for me. And, the photography seemed artificial - noticeable - almost unreal in parts. It just distracted me. I would suggest seeing other far more entertaining and better done films like `Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' or `The Muppets' before this one! Sorry Steven, you missed the mark for me.col' or `The Muppets' before this one! Sorry Steven, you missed the mark for me.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I got this app so that I could make good use of the PDF versions of my textbooks on my ASUS Transformer tablet.  My university provides PDF textbooks for free, plus the books are heavy and bulky, so its not convenient to travel with them.  Just what I save on books easily pays for the tablet.  The RepliGo Reader app is probably the best $5 I've spent on an education tool in a long time.    If you use PDF's on your tablet or phone at anything more than a casual level, spend the money for this tool.  I love how I can highlight and annotate the documents.  Plus, I can save them and upload them to my computer and read them there with all of my personal changes.  Highly recommended.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|The fiio didn't work properly at first. I don't know if it was  a break-in period or a bad wire, but I heard nasty digital distortion anywhere past a reasonable volume from my cable box output. I also noticed some time latency issues. All the other system settings were correct- stereo not dolby, PCM only, etc.<br />I tried both coax and optical inputs but the problem persisted and I considered returning the unit. Then after a few days of resetting and changing wires the system now works perfectly. I'm using Bose companion 20s instead of home theater, and they sound excellent in my medium sized room.<br />I'd say that a savings of several hundred dollars is worth a few days of tweaking.
B005KELQEU|5.0|The description of this product was exactly what I wanted for my Kindle. I was plesantly surprised and satisfied with it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is awesome and it works on the kindle fire. I could spend hours playing this game and it even entertains my 4 year old cousin. This game can be considered mind gaming puzzleish. I love this game.
0756405890|5.0|This book is now my all time favorite and recommend to anyone who enjoys a great story this one is epic.
B005ZUR724|4.0|Amazon, update this game. Or I want my 99&cent; back. Started playing and it was a really good game until I tried logging back in. It upsets me.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This is the longer 9' cable to connect the laptop to HDTV. There is no noticeable signal loss. Longer length allows you to set the laptop down and not have to hold it in front of the TV.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you like solitaire you will like this! Easy to use and its great for on the go. in my opinion its the best.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This was the second cover I purchased this Christmas for the Kindle Fire I purchased for my husband.  It is extremely well made and well worth the money.  I plan on purchasing one for myself.  You can't go wrong with this cover - better than leather!!!

0307959856|3.0|It is by no means the most intricate or compelling P.D. James mystery. And Lizzie, surprisingly, does not make a bold impression in the book. But where else are you going to get a chance to visit with your old friends at Pemberley? P.D. James is, of course, a wildly popular writer for a reason. So she captures the graceful spirit of being in Austen-land. It's worth a read if you're an Austen fan, not for the mystery, but just for the fun.
0375842209|5.0|Absolutely brilliant. Love, love, love it. \\"The Book Thief\\" is as heartbreaking as it is moving.   Zusak shows the other side of the German people through Liesel Meminger's eyes as told by Death. The innocent orphaned child living with the accordian playing Hans, who captures her heart and the rough exterior Mama who displays her love by calling her a \\"filthy pig!\\"  Never have I read a more amazing book. Pure genius. Death as the narrator? Wonderful.  The writing was like poetry, I applaud Zusak for the astounding piece.  I have never reread a book, but this one... I just might.  This is a must read!!! Simple, elegant, and yet so touching, \\"The Book Thief\\" will always remain a part of my bookshelf.   Highly. Recommend.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I just received this case for my new Kindle Fire, and so far, it seems like a very sturdy case.  My Kindle fits securely and snugly in the case, and the cover seems to be made of durable plastic on the outside and felt on the inside to protect the screen.
1594744769|2.0|I must say... I expected a whole lot more from this book.  If it wasn't for the pictures, I'm not sure I would have finished.   Flipping through the pages and just taking a look at that cover made me want to pick it up and read it. So I did. And I was very disappointed.   The idea was good. The plot had a lot going for it; unfortunately, the author did not execute it well at all.   The characters were not fully developed in my opinion, we were informed of very little of the many characters the author incorporated which were intended to stand out as the main ones. For example, the father. Or his best friend.   The story was drawn out where little to nothing happened. It was up until near the end when major events started to take place and the author threw them at you spontaneously.    I hated the ending. The ending was just an ending. I had no afterthought or anything. It seemed as if the author didn't know how to finish so just decided to leave the story at a random spot. It left me dazed and VERY unsatisfied. The ending makes me wonder if there's perhaps a sequel. Nothing was summed up. Characters were left hanging. So many strings are left drawn and unconnected.  Disappointing.   It was OK. Not great. Do I recommend? Not really.   For a person who is an avid reader and understands what a good book should fully entail, don't read.  For a person who doesn't read much but just wants something to do, you may be interested.
B006QF7664|2.0|This movie left me feeling like I'd been conned out of the cost of an Amazoid rental. While watching, I had feelings of \\"bad-movie-deja-vu\\"...like I'd felt this compulsion before. It was an irrepressible impulse to grab the remote and permanently pause this bit of filmic three-card Monte. Then it hit me---this was basically the Blair Witch Project on the moon! Meh...I hated the Blair Witch Project.

B00117W1K8|5.0|My brother has been a fan of Supernatural for some time. Recently, my wife and I decided to give it a try. So far, we're really enjoying it (almost finished with Season 1).<br /><br />The episodes are well written and acted. Production value is quite high for the episodic format. I like the chemistry between the two lead actors and the fact that the show doesn't take itself too serious (without getting cheesy). Looking forward to watching the remaining seasons. Recommended.

1451627289|4.0|As a life long fan of Stephen King, I was delighted. I have read all of King's work and can honestly say I have enjoyed them all. Some of my favorites were the Talisman written with Peter Straub, Lawnmower Man, It, the Gunslinger and my personal favorite the Stand.  11/22/63 is a breathtaking glimpse at one of the most talked about events in US History and the era in which it occurred.  King's research on the subject is evident, as he accurately details the past. Being a fan of sci-fi and Dr. Who, I found the subject of time travel and its effects fascinating.<br /><br />I love the way King draws you into a story and doesn't let you go until the end. Despite that fact that his novels are long, I continually find myself sadden at how quickly they come to an end.  The protagonist Jake Epping is a likable English teacher, who cares about his students and friends. He is drawn into time travel by a dying friend.  I absolutely loved the way King explained the trips back, the effects and the characters he created there. The transformation from Jake to George Amberson was incredible. The character growth and personality changes were very believable. King's ability to take us into the psyche of his characters never ceases to amaze me.<br /><br />When Jake went back in time, I went with him. I slipped into an era of simpler times and yet an era filled with segregation, fear and prejudice.  With a stroke of a pen, King paints a vivid picture. He takes us back to Derry in the years after IT. I totally loved the references to his prior novels. It's so typical of the King to add these little treats for fans. As Jake alters events from the past, strange things begin happening.You begin to feel uneasy as the timeline tries to prevent Jake from change it. I loved the people in the town of Jodie Texas, and would have enjoyed living there. The romance between Jake and Sadie, was romantic and genuine. I shed tears for them both. My only complaint was the sappy ending. I am not sure why King felt the need to wrap it up in a cute little bow.d to wrap it up in a cute little bow.
B004SCN2F6|4.0|Great game, I wish the world's would be random so that the replayablility was better. Overall a great game and the best space game out there.
030745455X|1.0|I got wrapped up in the whole \\"Girl Who Does Various Things that Bear Little Relevance to the Actual Book\\" craze, and picked up this one shortly after reading \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" Only the first few dozen pages of this one are enjoyable, and that's only compared to the total dreck that follows.<br /><br />The beginning is a prologue of sorts, because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book. It has Lisbeth Salander doing what she does best: taking revenge on the Men Who Hate Women (the original title of the first book when translated verbatim from Swedish). Unfortunately, Salander has been reduced to a kinky fantasy, a punk bi-sexual chick with a violent streak who must be a maniac in the sack. One problem threatens to burst this fetish bubble: her tiny breasts. Thankfully she can fix that problem with all the money she earned in the last book. Her breast augmentation seems entirely false and only serves Larsson's own raging lust for the character.<br /><br />The rest of the book is tedious. Mikael Blomkvist and the police pursue Salander for a crime she didn't commit. This isn't a spoiler. You know she didn't commit the crime from the beginning. There is no tension in the investigation and the chase because it's fruitless for both the police and the reader.<br /><br />Speaking of tedium, Larsson's propensity for detail reaches tedious extreme in this book. Do you want to know every single item Lisbeth Salander buys at IKEA? If so, this is the book for you!<br /><br />I went to IKEA with a friend and mentioned that part of the book to her. \\"I have the book in my purse,\\" she said. We found the passage with Salander's IKEA trip and went on an IKEA Scavenger Hunt, finding each item of furniture Salander purchased. We learned two things from this experience: 1. Shopping at IKEA is more fun than reading this book. 2. Lisbeth Salander has horrible taste in furniture. Nothing in her apartment matches. Maybe the Swedish IKEA isn't like the American IKEA, but the IKEA of the States has a \\"buy this whole room!\\" display, where you can buy a set of furniture that matches. Quick and easy. That seems more like Salander to me. She doesn't seem like the type of girl that would spend hours furniture shopping. Of course, she doesn't seem like the type of girl that would get a boob job either.<br /><br />Add to this disaster a wholly unbelievable villain (he can't feel pain!) and a variety of Star Wars-esque revelations, and a fade-to-black conclusion that means this isn't the second volume in a trilogy--it's the first half of a too-long epic chore. Not recommended, even if you enjoyed the first book.this whole room!\\" display, where you can buy a set of furniture that matches. Quick and easy. That seems more like Salander to me.

0312576463|5.0|Earlier this year, David Brooks tried to condense human nature into a single story about the life of one boy and one girl, interspersed with observations from the social sciences. Where that ambitious book, [[ASIN:0812979370 The Social Animal]], ultimately failed to deliver on its promise, Freedom succeeds by bringing its central characters to life, by making us truly understand Patty and Walter throughout their struggles with each other, with their friend Richard, and with their son Joel. It's a captivating book that justifies manyfold the decade of effort that went into it.
B005MVIF7M|1.0|I've been a long time Jeff Tweedy fan.  Watching Wilco play at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis after the release of Being There still stands out as my all time favorite concert.  Falling in love with Summerteeth on the very first listen.  Being blown away with the experimental yet catchy Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Then the love affair begins to die.  It's at about this time that Wilco albums seem to have lost the hooks and grooves that would draw me in to most of their music.  A Ghost is Born has some really good cuts on it.  But Sky Blue Sky, Wilco, and The Whole Love all blend together in a very blah, prdictable way.  We are dealing with amazing musicians, and who am I to critique such masters of their art.  I'm just a fan that loved the catchiness of Summerteeth and thought the dynamics on YHF were amazing.  I know what I like about Wilco and for any band for that matter.  Music with a great groove and hooks to make you sing along.  This album has none of that.  Boring and predictable from the first track to the last.  This will be my last Wilco album.
B005GIS8VE|5.0|It's really hard to get my point across without giving anything away.  I'm sure the main reason you are reading reviews, is to see if it's worth it for you to watch,  so I'll try this...  If you took Blazing Saddles, Lord of the Rings, and The Notebook, threw them in a blender, you would ALMOST end up with this.  If you're looking for constant raunchiness, an hour and a half of special effects, a full on chick flick, pure gore, or a full out laugh fest...you're not going to get it.  Though, it does have elements of all.  This is for fans of ALL genres.  And by that, I mean YOU must be a fan of all genres, or something will turn you off.  And for those of you who are too high and mighty to laugh at 'offensive' humor...it's not for you.  Even though, that's not the whole movie...it IS spread throughout.  You can continue to watch America's Funniest Videos, laugh at people because of their hairstyles, clothes, piercings, etc....and pretend that no one is EVER the subject of a joke that you laugh at! There is a difference between hate and humor...if you can't tell the difference, then run away from this movie!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. It allows me to have the Bible anywhere especially when you download the offline versions which you can use even when you are not online.
0307593312|4.0|1Q84 is an imperfect book. Utilizing a similar sort of dual narrative as Murakami's \\"Hard Boiled Wonderland/End of the World\\", it progresses slowly through a typically Murakamian world of inexplicable phenomena, mysterious and mercurial women, sudden appearances and disappearances, as witnessed by disconnected, lonely and passive protagonists. The book is driven to its climax by the inexorable logic and structure of the narrative, not by any motive force of the protagonists. Squeamish readers may be turned off by some of the explicit (and occasionally aberrant) sexual behavior in the book, but it certainly never becomes pornographic.  If you've read other Murakami, the characters, plot, and themes of this book will seem familiar, and you will be anticipating the ending long before it arrives. On the other hand, 1Q84 still retains the inventive and compelling prose of Murakami's other novels, and I cannot say I did not enjoy it thoroughly.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|This headphones are incredible, sound quality is fantastic.  i love the 50mm speakers compared to 40mm or lesser quality.  Wireless feature is amazing.  The crackling and popping happens, but only if there is wireless interference.  The only time i hear it is when the signal fades in an out (when i go to my basement to get a drink) or when i use an internet-heavy application on my macbook.  Wireless on the kindle or my Droid Razr causes no interference whatsoever.  The headset wireless transmitter is right next to my modem for the whole house, and still, the only popping happens when there is interference on my macbook.  The dolby is good, but i think the only way to have true 7.1 quality sound is to buy 7 speakers and a subwoofer, buy an amplifier and processor and set it up in your room.  For a headset, I would much rather have 2 50 mm speakers in the headset with \\"fake-ish\\" dolby than 8 smaller speakers and true 5.1 like in the Tritton axPro.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Ok so I bought this app the other day for my Kindle fire. It was the free app of the day so I thought, why not? I am so glad I downloaded it!. The graphics are excellent and the sound quality is great! At first, when you play the game you think there are only 2 modes but really the 2nd mode has several.modes within it. I would recommend this game to anyone! It really is worth the $0.99! * I got it for free though since it was the app of the day ;)**
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I had read many of the negative reviews, then some of the positive. I decided to purchase this cover based on the arguments in the positive reviews. It seemed that most of the negative comments were due to a lack of understanding of the product.   Some of those negative comments:  1. Very thin (Yes, that is correct. However, thin equals lightweight in this case, as well as not adding bulk to the Kindle Fire.)  2. Plastic - seems cheap. (IMO, the plastic has a high tech look and feel to it. It is the lightly rubberized/matte plastic that you see in many iPhone covers. I'm very pleased with its appearance. Comments that I received when I showed it around were all positive.)  3. Difficult to insert the Kindle Fire into the cover. (I read the instructions and placed one edge in first. The other edge easily clipped in with no effort. Incidentally, the clips do NOT impinge on the front of the Fire at all, leaving the entire face uncovered. I like that aspect quite a lot.)  4. Cheap elastic band to hold cover closed. (I do find the elastic a bit awkward to use. You reverse it whey you go from closed to open. Cheap? It seems sturdy and adequate for the job.)  5. The slot to hold the cover in place when you turn it into a stand doesn't work. (It actually works great when the Fire is in the cover. I'm pretty impressed with the minimalist design. It does look like it won't work, but does its job great.)  So....  I am very impressed with the cover. It's a fine bit of very successful industrial design - simple and functional. I recommend this cover for purchase if you're looking for sleek, understated, high tech look, and functional.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game. I love playing it. Its super fun to play on the Kindle Fire! Just tap and slide the cards and the &quot;hint&quot; button is great,too.
1451627289|5.0|What a fun book.  I liked Under the Dome, I loved this a LOT more.  What a GREAT ending!  Steve King is at the top of his game.  One of his best yet.  If you thought Under the Dome was a great return of King to the glories of his past, that book pales in comparison to 11/22/63.  This is a whole different level.  Being from Lewiston, Maine, just a few miles down Route 196 from the Worumbo Mill, the local Androscoggin County action was especially fun.  I was five when JFK was shot, I remember it like it was yesterday.  The second half of this novel is about as good as Stephen King gets.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|The first eBook I've ever bought. I didn't realize at first that it was reprinted from his blogs, but I'm fine with that. His blogs are always interesting and informative. I'm happy to have this in Kindle format to read and re-read as desired.

B005NPLXJ4|2.0|I'm a big prog-rock fan and have always liked concept albums. When I first heard of this collaboration between Lou Reed and Metallica, I was very excited. I listened to some leaked clips on Youtube (and some VERY FUNNY fan spoofs on YouTube). I pre-ordered the album and listened through several times trying to reserve judgement.<br /><br />Initially, the mix of Lou Reed's flat, spoken-word style and Metallica's rapid-fire metal seemed totally incongruous. That is, it just hurt to listen to it.<br /><br />After a couple listens, Metallica faded to the back and I was able to connect with Reed's rhythm. For reference, see my review of Miles Davis' [[ASIN:B00136NUAC Bitches Brew]]. I understand that art can require patience and was willing to do the same for Reed et al. I was rewarded for breaking through the initial dissonance with an appreciation for what Reed was trying to accomplish...<br /><br />But then something happened... Things stopped getting better. I started to get bored with Reed's spoken word and the dissonance came back to the surface.<br /><br />Oddly, this was the same experience I've felt with Velvet Underground. Despite putting forward a real effort, Lou Reed's lyrics and vocals end up being much more shallow than I want them to be.
1423101502|5.0|I loved this book! The characters-Percy, Annabeth, Grover, Tyson, Chiron, Rachel, Clarisse, Nico, and the gods- Are all clever characters. Percy and his camp, plus more, must fight against Kronos, the God of Time, and his army of evil. Percy has swam through the river Styx, and now he is more powerful than before.   Around the end of the book, Annabeth and Percy FINALLY are together. And Rachel, the new oracle, tells a prophecy.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I am sad that the series had to end, but I liked that Percy and Annabeth are together. Gonna try and figure out the prophecy!!!
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I own a pair of [[ASIN:B000065BPB Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones]] and the PX21 Gaming headset is a definite step down from that in terms of audio quality and feel.  I wanted to have headphones that included a mic, but didn't want to skimp too much on quality. It turns out I've been spoiled by Sennheiser.  I ended up not using the mic that often and just putting back on the Senns.  Even turning up the Bass switch on the PX21 to max doesn't compare to the natural sounding bass frequencies produced by the Sennheiser.  If you're looking for superior quality audio and don't need a mic, then I highly recommend the Sennheiser combined with the Earfoce DSS processor (product link below) for your gaming and movie surround sound experience.    The problems with the PX21 are mostly minimal, but I thought combining this with the [[ASIN:B003O0KICS Ear Force DSS 7.1 Channel Dolby Surround Sound Processor]] also made by Turtle Beach, I would have a winner.  The DSS processor is a nice added bonus for true 7.1 surround sound in a headset, but both together don't quite live up to their expectations considering how much you are paying for these moderately high quality audio products. It turns out my pair produces some light buzzing noises in-game when it's suppose to be silent.  Furthermore, I found the \\"Expander\\" switch to be nearly useless as it produced too much echo and ambient static noise for my taste.  Better to leave it off.  The only good things I find about this headset are plenty of adjustment dials for volume, bass and chat controls, the long reach of the cord, and the microphone sounds decent. However, in looking for good quality audio for your surround gaming or movie experience in the form of a headset, it is hard for me to recommend the PX21 unless you are just looking for a better microphone for in-game chatting and are not looking for a headset to turn up to max volume.  In those cases, you don't need a better quality headset and these will do just fine.

0307959856|1.0|P.D. James must know the admonition to \\"show not tell.\\" However, her novel is one of telling and retelling the same details about the crime until the end, when finally someone shows up to tell it differently.  That Elizabeth and Darcy are in the novel is a fact that fades to the background as their personalities become as bland as milquetoast and the novel becomes more about the movement of characters than the revelation of character.  Save your reading time for something more worthy.

0061564893|5.0|The facts is all around us.  From the plants to the animals that were seen by Columbus when it visited America.  From the sunken ships and the DNA evidence all over the world linking the Natives to Chinese DNA.   Even the Native Alaskans look Chinese.  The reason we don't see any Native American looking Chinese is because they were wiped off the map when the Europeans showed up.  Even Hawaii has a few Natives that look very Chinese.   This book is very interesting. Since new evidence are popping up since the released of this book back in 2003, there is a huge wave of evidence pointing to the fact that the Chinese reached America first and the Columbus and Megellen used a map to reach the Americas.    Columbus even admitted to using a map in his log.    The facts aren't in the book.  The facts are all around us.  This book brings to attention that history should be re-written.  But that will never happened.    Of course there will be a bunch of naysayers claiming that the Chinese voyage was a myth.  I wouldn't give those people any attention.  These are the same people who believes the myth of Bible and how God promised a bunch of Europeans a land called Palestine.
B005BCE7FQ|1.0|In the spirit of Ice Age, the makers of this movie have taken what ought to be a thought-provoking subject area (the ecosystem of the Brazilian rain forest) and completely perverted it with equal amounts of adult innuendo, grossly inner-city hip hop and \\"bling,\\" lowest-common-denominator stereotypes of Brazilians, and a chicken-drumstick-eating cockatiel. There is little plot to speak of, no real character development, and no theme whatsoever. Unsurprisingly, the Spanish language track is translated to use the worst Mexican Spanish and Spanglish slang of the U.S. urban ghetto. And to top it all off, the 3D was almost entirely in-screen and underwhelming--very half-heartedly done.   I had to turn the movie off after 35 minutes, as there was no way I was going to let my 9 year old continue to watch this junk. While I was enraged, my Mexican wife was horrified by how bad the movie is. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's offensive, stupid, technically underwhelming--in five words, an insulting waste of money.
B00129H7VS|4.0|Though, the previews of other HBO Blu-ray features at the beginning of the first disc are in a quality below DVD standards. While watching these previews, I had my fingers crossed that the BoB series would not be in such poor quality. Thankfully, it wasn't. HBO should fix this flaw. Yes, I know they are just previews...but still. I want quality all-around.  Overall a superb mini-series everyone should watch. This is a war-drama series with little action. We're talking 90% talky with 10% war-action. And half of that 90% is actually just long glances and gazes--seriously. Yes, I am making fun of the series. But, when you break it down, it's mostly just a lot of starring (sp?) and open jaws.   I wanted more action. Don't get me wrong, I love a good talky, but I felt a lot of the action scenes in this series are short-changed. I read The Pacific brings in more action. I'll have to check that series out.  Also, the supposed worse times for Easy Company--their experience in Bastogne, which is span across two episodes, did not feel as powerful as it should, atleast to me. It felt kinda empty, though it did have some memorable moments.   But overall, this is a SUPERB series with beautiful cinematography, acting, scoring, and directing that deserves the many awards it has gotten.   And those two comrades, forgot their names, episode 2, right after landing in Normandy, who just met up after jumping, found an active AA nest. Why on earth didn't they take it out? There were only like 3 guys in it. One grenade could've gotten them all. I felt leaving that nest behind was a big fail and it bothered me.

B000ATQYT2|3.0|This film, in its original widescreen version, is a 5-star movie for sure.  This item (supposedly) replaces our VHS version and I was so looking forward to seeing it in DVD quality and viewing the bonus material that I was sure would be added.  While the bonus material didn't disappoint, the inexplicable omission of the song \\"When Love is Gone\\" just left me baffled and ANGRY!  Having it on the full-screen version provides cold comfort as I would never have even bothered with the compromised version until learning that the song is contained within.  Disney's been known to be \\"dumb like a fox\\" and will probably correct the error in a \\"from the vault\\" re-release some time down the road.  If justice were served, everyone who got snookered into buying this one would automatically receive a FREE copy!  I won't hold my breath!

B000068FUS|5.0|I was blown away by this album.  I already had Brighter than Creations Dark by DBT, and Loved it.  But I was in no way prepared for the total awesomeness of Southern Rock Opera.  I'm kinda tight when it comes to buying music, but after listening to this album, I came back to Amazon and bought the rest of DBT's albums.  This album is in my opinion the best of all of them.  It really tugged on my emotions.  To me, about half this album is a sort of tribute to Lynyrd Skynyrd.  The lyrics tell a pretty much unbiased history of Lynyrd Skynyrd, (and their relationship with Neil Young), of George Wallace, and the south in general.  I actually learned some things off of this album.  Buy this album.  You won't be disappointed.  A true must have for any Skynyrd fan, and an excellent album musically and lyrically for everyone else.
6305907145|1.0|Maybe if you could completely separate yourself from the fact that this movie bears the title of \\"Mansfield Park,\\" it might be enjoyable.  (And I am talking a very slim \\"might.\\").  But who besides an established fan of the genre would be taking the time to watch another adaptation of yet another Austen work?  I understand that some changes need to be made when transferring literature to the screen, but this was ludicrous.  Fanny Price is portrayed so far from the demure, quiet, undiscovered youth that she is hardly recognizable.  Just seeing her expression on the cover tells this is a newly created character bearing a very familiar name.  Liberties are taken with other characters as well.  If you have any interest in true Austen, don't waste your time on this film.

Meanwhile, I'll just have to stare longingly at my sister's brand new Iphone, which runs this adorable game wonderfully. *SIGH* I sure wish more developers would include specific, comprehensive lists of known device incompatibilities. Cry all you want about fragmentation, but this is what we have to work with on Android. I think it deserves to be handled with greater transparency, particularly for paid applications.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is great! I love the challenge. you can play easy to hard.  one of my favorite games yo play.
0307891372|5.0|The hubby thought I was nuts for buying this to go with the game. After seeing the massive amount of area and all the side quests, radiant quests and miscellaneous objectives there was on top of the main stuff - he admitted it was a great purchase. I love it because of all the help it gives for the skills. My alchemy rocks because of knowing what kind of ingredients to look for. (side note: I'm a bit of a stickler for completing things 100% so this really helps to ensure that someday :) I will.)
B004U52VPS|5.0|This is a great game.  I especially like that it is motivating enough that my son with fine motor difficulties wants to play it even though it is difficult for him.  It's not an easy game, but it is a lot of fun!

It reminds me of my cell phone case which has with stood so many drops from me and my kids. I feel safe putting my kindle in my purse and back pack knowing it wont get damaged. I'm happy I didn't listen to the negative feedback on this product. Some people just cant be pleased!
B00005JLKB|2.0|It really crawls (snail's pace).  This series had potential, could have been truly outstanding.  The main problem with Smallville is the agonizingly slow pace of each story.  Also, there is  just way too much uninteresting dialogue,taking up too much on screen time.  I liked practically  every superman tv show, movie, and 1970's comic books that I've ever seen, and some of the episodes  in the Smallville series are somewhat okay.  Some additional minor gripes that I have with this  series are as follows:  1. Too Brooding  2. Stories and Characters exude very little (if any) joy   3. Lacks a sense of \\"GREATNESS\\"  4. No special Magic (the whole is definitely NOT GREATER    than the sum of its parts ! )  5. The \\"Fourth Wall\\" is never broken down   6. Takes itself WAY TOO SERIOUSLY  If you want to see a fun-to watch superhero tv series that has it all, purchase \\"The FLASH\\",    a tv superhero series that had a brief run 20 years ago.  It has all 21 original episodes  and the 90 minute made-for tv pilot movie (episode).  The Pilot episode is probably way  too violent for small children. However, this series is most probably the best tv series  of a comic-book superhero that has ever been made.  It can be bought at this Website !!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw my friend quoting this book on Facebook, and from her quotes it sounded like another \\"Twilight\\" book with cheesy romance. I got my new kindle and the price wasn't bad so I thought I would give it a chance anyway. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I actually loved this book! The book is easy to read (usually I like a little bit of a harder read), but it doesn't take away from the message. The amount of suspense, gore, and (as little romance there is) made it hard for me to put away. Like I said I don't like overly cheesy books where the romance is sickening. The romance is subtle but enough to make the story that much better. I seriously recommend this book!
0743429907|5.0|I have barely read any history books, but I really enjoyed this one. If you don't know much about military history, you have to really pay attention to understand it, but it is very entertaining. This book gave me a great deal of respect for not just that company but everyone involved in WW2.   If you want to read a great book about a company of heroes in WW2, this book is for you. A lot of historical books are difficult to understand but this one is a pretty easy read.

B005DF2QMC|2.0|Cheap, convinient to use may be the only positives about this product. The tape player runs noticeably slower than it should be, resulting in elongated sound (think about playing Mariah Carrey at half the speed!).

B004EPZ084|5.0|I think every single person who has ever worked a job has had one of these bosses at some point in their life.  Laughed so hard I cried.  Saw it twice in theater and just had to have the DVD.  Now I can watch it when I need a good laugh.
B004EPYZXK|1.0|Some of the reviews for this movie claim it is made from \\"found footage\\". There is virtually no found footage in the movie besides a few rocket blast offs. Just about everything else is new footage made to look old by jumping sprockets, bad focusing, flashing lights and other retro touches. It is really easy to tell all the found footage is fake. Just about all of the movie is supposed to be filmed inside the lunar module on the surface of the moon or actually on the surface of the moon. Unfortunately the producers didn't realize that gravity on the moon is 1/7th that of the gravity on earth. Yet the astronauts sleep in a hammock, sit down in the module, set things down to rest in the module and do a 100 other things that would never occur in a reduced gravity situation. This is a disaster movie but for all the wrong reasons.

B006BZ8WAI|5.0|This is one colossally good album.  On paper this seems like a weird idea and like it wouldn't work, but the mix of styles is done spot on.  It's true that a bit of Korn's hard rock edge is tapered by the introductions from the DJs, but this is accounted for by the heavy beats that are added.  The DJs chosen have excellent sounds for mixing with Korn's rock and the styles seem like soul-mates who finally found each other and are just dancing away together, or more like mosh-pitting away together.  The album is overall entirely worth purchasing and it makes me not able to wait to see what Korn is able to come up with next with their continued experimentation and desire to create and bring different things to their fans.    As far as the songs go, I'd have to say that Narcissistic Cannibal is the gem.  It's true it's all over the radio, but that's for a reason.  I'm also a big fan of Let's Go.  Just makes you wanna jump up and down.  I guess my third and final exceptional mention is Bleeding Out.  It's seems a bit more laid back, but once you get into it it's definitely not.  It's got a smoother flow and is just awesome.    Buy this CD and be very pleased.  I was.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|The movie \\"Doubt (2008)\\" is an experience you shouldn't miss. It's a moral roller-coaster and ethical juggernaut of a story brought to life by two of the finest actors you can find in any country on any continent: Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Father Brendan Flynn) and Meryl Streep (as the sister with the impossible name: Aloysius Beauvier).<br /><br />The plot is both very simple and not so very simple. Sister Aloysius is a disciplinarian. She thinks modernity is relaxing people and sapping away their character and faith. That's why she is even against using ballpoint pen in the church school. She is a hard-as-nails woman suspicious of anything and everything around her - which betrays her hunger for control and power as well.<br /><br />Opposite her is Father Flynn, a beautiful compassionate man who is trying to change the stodgy old ways of the church and welcome all parishioners regardless of their imperfections. He thinks the church should be more like the people; an idea which Sister Aloysius abhors. She believes people actually enjoy the priests and nuns to be very different from the common folk and that's why they believe in clergy and continue to have faith in the church.<br /><br />Into this dyad, steps in Sister James, played by another actor of note and immense talent, Amy Adams, an Irish beauty with clear eyes which reminds me of a younger Jane Fonda.<br /><br />Sister James observes certain things about Father Flynn. Just impressions. Snippets of sense data. She \\"catches\\" Father Flynn dropping something into the locker of the only African American student in the church school, Donald (played by Joseph Foster). She is aware that Father has met with this boy ALONE in his room. Hmmm... that the kid was caught with ALCOHOL on his breath... another hmmm... The question \\"is there really anything going on here?\\" somehow spins into \\"what's exactly going on here?\\" in the mind of the impressionable Sister James.<br /><br />Then, Sister James, in all her naivete, commits the monumental blunder of sharing her \\"doubt\\" with the Sister General, who is also the principal of the school. And the rest is a tsunami of innuendo, picking up speed and becoming a head-on train wreck, a spectacle which forces us to question our very own assumptions about what's a fact and what's a gossip. To what extend should we trust our own assumptions about \\"human nature\\"?<br /><br />The very last scene of this great film throws in a monkey wrench so fast that you can never see it coming. And the film ends right there, leaving you stunned as though you're zapped by a taser gun, without any adequate cooling off period to come back to your senses. You'll go home fighting back your tears and looking deep into your own heart about the way you went through similar situations in your own past, sometimes in flying colors and sometimes in colors that faded fast into mediocrity and moral self-righteousness. You'll be touched.t\\" with the Sister General, who is also the principal of the school.

B00102F5WK|4.0|Anwar Al-Ibrahimi, an Egyptian-American chemical engineer with a Green Card, is apprehended by the CIA on his return flight from a conference in South Africa. Why? Because his phone records showed that he received cell-phone calls from Rashid Salimi, a well-known terror mastermind.<br /><br />Al-Ibrahimi has an American wife Isabella (Oscar-winner Reese Witherspoon), pregnant with their second children, and eagerly waiting for him back in their Chicago suburban home. Al-Ibrahimi is whisked away from the Dulles Airport in Washington DC for a CIA interrogation when William Dixon, a CIA official, is killed by a suicide bomber at a \\"North African\\" country - which suspiciously looks like Morocco. Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), a CIA analyst who's not fit for covert operations by his own admission, reluctantly steps in to fill the void left from Dixon.<br /><br />When Al-Ibrahimi does not 'fess up to knowing Rashid Salimi and when he also can't explain how he keeps receiving phone calls from Salimi, he's bundled up and sent back to the \\"North African\\" country for the kind of interrogation that would not be allowed under the US laws.<br /><br />What follows are revolting scenes of torture in a dark leaky dungeon while Isabella tries her best to retrieve her husband through her old flame Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard), now a high-ranking Senate staffer. But she hits a wall of silence since CIA chief Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is adamant to \\"pay the price\\" and punish the killers of her subordinate. She is a force of nature who does not take any prisoners on the battle field.<br /><br />An important subplot involves the story of the \\"Arab\\" chief on intelligence Abasi Fawal (played with amazing authority by Yigal Naor), his daughter and the Arab kid who loves her but ends up as an anti-government suicide-bomber trying to kill Fawal, the father of his girlfriend.<br /><br />At the end Douglas Freeman manages to free Anwar Al-Ibrahimi from Fawal's dungeon and sends him back home to his wife, son, and mother. But damage is done both to him and to his wife's sense of what's right and what's wrong in pursuit of the U.S. national security interests.<br /><br />A thriller that forces us to meditate over a number of unpleasant realities that became a part of our lives in the post-9/11 world. Recommended.done both to him and to his wife's sense of what's right and what's wrong in pursuit of the U.S. national security interests.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a unique film that I've heard generated many different interpretations, including the one which claimed that the film made mockery of the Japanese culture and hence was inherently a racist work of art... an interpretation which frankly has shocked me. Whoever thinks that way has either missed the whole point of the film or has never been \\"lost\\" themselves in a similar situation.<br /><br />But I should qualify: the feeling of getting lost depicted in this movie goes even beyond the process of translation and dislocation since the characters Bill Harris  (the B-list celebrity) and Charlotte (young wife of a photographer) are lost even before setting foot in Japan anyways. They are lost \\"in the original\\", in their original lives back in the United States as well. That's why I've viewed this fine and unusual work several times not as a critique of \\"what Japan does to Americans\\" but \\"what modern high-paced professional life does to normal human beings who yearn for affection and genuine human contacts.\\"<br /><br />There are no car chases in this movie. No sex scenes. No blood and gore. But there is plenty of sensitivity, many scenes that lay bare our predicament as temporary creatures on this earth with infinite hearts and yearnings. The director Sofia Coppola has done a great job to honor the family tradition (Francis Coppola is her father) of fine film-making. May her tenure be long and fruitful.

0765322889|3.0|Have you ever watched a movie and felt like there had to have been a prequel that you missed that would explain a lot? That's what best describes this book.This book has some really good moments, almost bordering on great, but the first few hundred pages are just so incoherent and insubstantial (and there is a big need for substance and explanation) and well, baffling that you have to really be devoted to finishing books to attempt this.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|Where was the Maps function in the initial version of the Kindle Fire version?  Without Maps it was not a very attractive app. Not worth downloading.  However, I just discovered a pending update for The Weather Channel App and downloaded it. Turns out that the new version (Ver 3.5.5) has added the Maps tab. Probably not the last time we see a new app rushed out for the Fire with missing features in the first version.  And Maps on the Fire display are terrific.  Beats looking at the maps on my Droid 2 phone. Just the screen quality you would expect on the Fire.  Colors and details really jump out.  Everything else in the app is the same as the phone app, which is just fine.  With the addition of Maps this app rates 5 stars.

0545259088|3.0|I cannot believe how this book was written!  I couldn't wait to get my hands on this 3rd and final book and was extremely disappointed in it to say the very least.  I absolutely loved book 1 and 2.  They had details AND a story in it that captured you and drew you in quickly without letting you go!  The last book, Forever, was ALL details!  Where is the story at?  If I had known that this book was all about describing the \\"scenes\\" without telling an actual story, I would have just skipped paying the $9.99 cost and went into BAM or some other bookstore and flipped to the last few pages to see what happens.  (Or just created my own ending in my head.)    I would not recommend this book for anyone unless they don't really care for a story, but just enjoys a bunch of details about a town, woods and/or a bunch of thoughts that aren't even necessary for the book.  As a writer, I think Maggie Stiefvater is great.  I just wish she would have taken more time to really plan out the final book.  With all that said, I will still look into her books in the future, but I will definitely research the reviews and/or take sneak peaks in the books before purchasing them again.  :(  Lettee

B00479SVBU|5.0|I ordered this unit for my husband's 2008 Hyundai Sonata which does not have an aux plug. The size appealed to me, but what sold me was the multi ways it could be used; with an MP3 player, an sd card or a USB stick. A brilliant idea IMHO! It arrived in a timely manner and Satachi (sp?)actually sent an email inquiring about its safe & timely arrival. Unusual customer service in this day and age! It worked out of the box at the preset frequency. We live in Chicago with a lot of interference due to tall buildings, etc so that was another pleasant surprise. It works with my IPod, as well as with his Shuffle, but it is primarily used with a 16gb sd card; great idea as nothing \\"sticks\\" out and it is quite pleasing to the eye (unlike our previous different brand transmitter which was bulky, kept disconnecting due to the weight and didn't work at all in this vehicle). The price was right and the Soundfly AUX player works GREAT!  Very satisfied customer.  Highly recommend both the unit and the manufacturer.

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Only rarely does a movie based upon a novel capture the essence of the original, but with GWTDT, it's now been accomplished twice over.  If you've seen the  excellent Swedish version that was released a couple of years ago, you've got to wonder why anyone would feel the need to do it again. Nevertheless,  screenwriter Steven Zaillian and director David Fincher did just that, and though theirs is not quite so menacing, it's exciting, compelling, and very well made.  Daniel Craig turns in a solid performance as disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist, although it seems he's been typecast, much as was Clint Eastwood in earlier days. Christopher Plummer is terrific in the role of  aging industrialist Henrik Vanger, who hires Blomqvist to find out who murdered his young niece decades ago. The real star of this show, however, is Rooney Mara, the virtual unknown who landed this plum of a role, the unconventional, psychologically damaged, yet powerful Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />This is a dark, brooding film, with two themes, that of the murder mystery, and that of  Lisbeth's unrelentingly painful young life. Brilliant but almost psychotically defensive, she's managed to retain her capacity for empathy. While she goes way overboard when compelled to bring about justice, she's the type of heroine that you can't help but root for. It's interesting to see Lisbeth's humanity begin to emerge as she and Blomqkvist begin to develop a relationship; too bad it takes about half the movie to get to their initial meeting. Though critics have written that the Zaillian version has been toned down for American audiences, its brutal violence and depravity are still difficult to watch. On the other hand, Sweden's wintery scenery provides the perfect backdrop for such a story.<br /><br />Let's hope it's not too long until the sequel, The Girl Who Played With Fire, hits the theaters.

B004EPYZXK|1.0|OK, it could have been interesting....but.  I was bored to tears.  The plot made no sense, the 'found footage' was annoying as the only images AND (SPOILER ALERT) based on the ending, HOW ARE WE WATCHING THIS?!?!?  The last title in the film talked about how moon rock samples have been stolen or are missing - what a wonderful twist if that had been revealed about half way thru the movie.  Think of all the mysteries that could lead to!
B003UYUP58|5.0|This is as much a biography of cancer treatment as it is of cancer itself. Start here if you, and chances are you are or will be, are coming to grips with living through cancer and want information on the disease, its treatment, and what we do and do not know.<br /><br />The book is very easy to read, Mr. Mukherjee's text is clear, his pacing excellent, and he introduces us to many engaging characters.  This book is also difficult to read as his clear text makes plain the issues of business, politics, mind-set inertia that impede progress in discovering cures and bringing them to patients.  The chapters that cover the link between cigarettes and cancer (in 1948!!) and the political foot dragging to abate this public health nuisance may have you screaming in rage.<br /><br />As someone who had Hodgkin's Disease (stage 3B) in 1976 I came away with a renewed sense of my own great fortune in having a cancer that was treatable thanks in part to the efforts of Mary Lasker and Sidney Farber for their huge contributions to getting cancer research attention and funding. Without their diligence research may have proceeded at a slower pace and the cure discovered years later. If you or someone you know has Leukemia, Hodgkins or breast cancer you will find lots of specific material in this book about your disease and the history of its treatment.  For other cancers this book will provide deep background into what your doctors do and don't know and factors that aid and inhibit their treatment of your disease.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  Be prepared for some squeamish moments while reading.<br />Note to Kindle readers:  when gauging your progress be aware the text ends at approximately 62% of the way through.  The balance is illustrations, end and foot notes, and the bibliography.
B004FEFS5E|4.0|The book is excellent for all the reasons described in the other reviews.

Match the right picture to the right situation and you have powerful communications that can make the sale before losing the audience.  The book does show you how to do this, and how to think about it.  However, the book overthinks itself and could be better for following its own advice!<br /><br />Longer, more traditional review.<br /><br />Based perhaps on the simplicity of the title, some reviewers have expressed disappointment that this book does not provide a simple silver bullet than can turn chaos into strategic plans and market dominance, all in the space of a paper napkin.  True, it does not do that.  What it does provide is a bundle of silver bullets that attack specific problem types -- and then a whole bundle of \\"user's manuals\\", one for each type of bullet and each way you could use it, and that does create levels of complexity that defy the original premise.<br /><br />The book sets up the basic frameworks (the types of story that need to be told and the ways in which those can be depicted).  The author then creates a matrix (codex) of those combinations - well, OK, we can live with that ...  But then we add another level of elaboration for each of the axes of the matrix.  That is where it gets pretty complicated in there.  To some extent one wonders whether this extra throw-weight comes from an effort to create a \\"serious\\" book rather than \\"powerful business presentations for dummies\\".  The parcel of extra pages actually are useful once you get past the point of saying \\"well, yeah\\" to the basic premises, and once you wade through them carefully and long enough.  Of course that is the anti-thesis of the original idea!  That could put you off the whole project, but it would also be a mistake.<br /><br />The book's themes and illustrations will definitely help you think about what message you are trying to sell to whom.  In narrowing down your presentation to a few proven themes you will definitely force yourself to separate the essence from the \\"cool graphics\\" or the \\"tons to words to convince you that I really have spent a lot of time thinking about this\\".  The truth is that if you have not convinced someone of your position, saying more of the same thing isn't going to convince them either; you need to say something that appeals to their understanding of the world.  For the most part, a briefing is supposed to be short (hence \\"brief\\"), not a battle of attrition.  You want a head-nod because people agree with you, not because they are going to sleep.  The approaches laid out in this book will help you get positive buy-in rather than sleepy acquiescence, and in the end that will have lasting impacts.<br /><br />Buy it, use it.  Use the principles and frameworks.  As you get familiar with them, the additional drill-downs will become clearer.what message you are trying to sell to whom.

1451627289|5.0|15-20 years ago, I read everything Stephen King wrote and without fail, eagerly awaited his newest work.  After awhile, I found that most of his novels became predictable and I gave up on him.  When I heard about the upcoming release of \\"11/22/63\\", I was intrigued by the subject matter and after reading the book, I wasn't disappointed.  Although I felt King was about to \\"lose it\\" in several places during the book, he always managed to bring me back.  Overall, \\"11/22/63\\" is a great read and I recommend it without reservation.  It left me with a tinge of melancholy and personally, made me reflect upon the past for as King aptly puts it, \\"...when the time is gone, you can never get it back\\".  For an 850 page book, it reads quickly and if you're a fan of King's older books (or even if you're not) or perhaps like me, had given up on him, give him another chance... I think you'll thoroughly enjoy this one.

B005V20JKI|4.0|Fun, addictive, easy to control, and runs greats on the EVO 3D. I didn't have any problems with this game. Sometimes I thought the characters ran a little fast and I ended up running in to places I didn't mean to. But, oh well. It is fun to try and unlock more and more characters and get them upgraded as well. Except that the very first upgrade involved boosting a characters speed. Sigh. Oh well. It was fun and enjoyable. $3 might be pushing it as there are other comparatively fun games at lower prices.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a wonderful book. If you were born since 1970, you have to read this book. You will feel like the entire novel was written just for you. The characters were great, the plot was very cool, and all the neat movies, videogames, songs, and people mentioned through-out (and most integral to the plot) were the cherries on the cake. I hope the author has a sequel in the works. Can't say enough about how awesome it was to read. Let's hope a movie is coming, too.

She hated her other potty chair [[ASIN:B004GCJMGQ Safety 1st Nature Next 3-in-1 Potty, Lime]], but when I got both of these delivered to my door, she sat right down on her new potty and read this book.

1591842972|5.0|This biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs is compact and well-structured.  It is well-written, flows easily and covers all the bases with regards to Steve Jobs' life at Apple, up to mid-2009 (Steve Jobs passed away in 2011).  The first 7 of the 9 chapters each end with a short exhibit that distills \\"Lessons from Steve\\", that is, what that particular chapter can teach people about how Steve Jobs approached the challenges that he faced at Apple.  John V. Karavitis  It greatly differs in style and content from Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, in that (1) Isaacson had the benefit of full physical access to and cooperation from Steve Jobs; (2) this biography focuses on Apple and its impact on both the PC and \\"digital lifestyle\\" industries, whereas Isaacson's biography deals more with Steve Jobs' personal history in much greater detail; and (3) Isaacson's biography covers Steve Jobs' death in 2011, whereas this \\"expanded edition\\" only goes up to mid-2009.  (I believe that Kahney is planning to issue a revised edition of this book to cover Steve Jobs' death.)  I think that it's difficult to get to the truth of a person, even when that person gives his biographer \\"full access\\" to his life, as Jobs gave to Isaacson.  Indeed, one problem that I had with Isaacson's biography (which I read before I read Kahney's) is that at times it read more like a \\"hagiography\\" than a biography.  Steve Jobs could do no wrong, and events which should have demanded further investigation were glossed over.  For example, at one point in Isaacson's book, we read conflicting stories as to whether Jobs' wife knew what she was doing when she met him at a business school seminar (her business school roommate alleges she worshiped Jobs, and even had posters of him on her bedroom walls;  she and Jobs claim that their meeting was accidental).  At the very end, we are told the apparent \\"reason\\" for Jobs' life-long pursuit of strange diets:  that the borderline starvation made him \\"high\\".  It's also tough to get at the truth (whatever that might be) when everyone has a positive spin.    The bottom line is that Kahney has done an excellent job in covering the basics of Steve Jobs at Apple (and Pixar), and his focus is on what we can learn about the business practices that made Apple great (\\"Lessons from Steve\\").  Is it as \\"complete\\" and detailed and full of interviews as Isaacson's biography?  No.  But you will look to Isaacson to read about Steve Jobs the person.  Read Kahney to learn about Steve Jobs the driving force behind one of the most successful product-oriented companies to ever exist.  Five stars.  John V. Karavitis, John Karavitis, Karavitis
0385535139|5.0|What a well conceived and fabulous story. I was hooked from page one.  It only got better with each chapter ! I found myself laughing out loud, and in touch with the characters. The character development and twist and turns of the story were wonderful and, best of all, there was a happy ending for everyone. I wish that there were more stories like this one as I would be first in line to purchase the next book. I hope that similar books by John Grisham will come forth soon in the same humorous vain with other witty characters who are perfect stereotypes of what one would expect. I never really figured how Miss Spence and the Pearl Harbor lunch would fit into the story so it was worth getting to the last page to have the final \\"cheers\\" to a marvelous tale. This should be required reading for anyone who needs a good laugh. It was a very refreshing story with David Zinc as an under dog hero.

0553801473|3.0|***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br />I borrowed this from my cousin after having read the first four in the series, and I'm glad I borrowed it rather than spent money on it. It's not that it's poorly written - Martin's first class prose makes it all readable, regardless of how frustrating an experience it became for me. It's just that it's, well, annoying...<br />My biggest gripe is that Martin seems to have no idea where this is all going. Perhaps his success with earlier installments has granted him total creative freedom (see how well that worked for another George, Lucas...)or perhaps his ego prevents constructive criticism. Whatever the reason, this work needs editing and it needs direction, because at the moment it is a headless chicken. A glorious headless chicken, but a headless chicken nonetheless. There are so many loose ends that I will be stunned if he is able to complete the story in another two volumes without resorting to simply killing off characters.<br />Which brings me to my next beef - simply killing off characters. Virtually every sympathetic or interesting character has just been bumped off, and those that miraculously survive (Catelyn Stark) are simply forgotten about as if this were a series of Dallas. Having the odd character murdered is OK, but it's as if Martin doesn't know what to do with them so he just reduces the headcount every once in a while to make his own life simpler. It's a deeply unsatisfying way to put an end to a character in my opinion, particularly those that are sympathetic or those who are nowhere near reaching their full potential. And yes, I know that in real life good does not always triumph over evil, or however you want to put it, but this IS NOT real life. I read fantasy (rarely I admit) to get away from real life, to root for the good guy in the knowledge that when it's not real the good guy wins. Hell, even the only decent Lannister is murdered in cold blood. I said decent, not interesting...<br />This fifth installment of the series also concentrates so much of the story outside Westeros that I found myself yearning for King's Landing. Frankly, I couldn't care less about what goes on in Slaver's Bay. Oh, and throw in the lost Targeryan heir and everything that has happened in the earlier books might as well not matter.<br />I see comparisons to Tolkien but they are way off the mark in my opinion. Much as I have enjoyed reading these books (and I enjoyed reading this one despite this review), A Dance With Dragons has lost almost every link to the first book. Different characters, those that remain completely unconnected to the reasons we first met them, the ones you wanted to survive all dead... Lord of the Rings is a great story because Tolkien knew what it was about and never lost sight of that. It would not be the same if Frodo and Sam bit the dust two thirds of the way through it. Martin, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have a clue and is way too keen to kill off major characters.<br />Despite all this I'm eager for the next installment and I hope Martin proves me wrong. But unless someone tells him to cut to the chase I expect more main character headcount reduction, more random new characters, more couldn't care less and more frustration.
0439023521|3.0|I would really prefer to gush over this book, and claim it's brilliance, and really sympathize with all the hype surrounding it.   Sadly, I can't.  The reason is not because the book is overtly terrible (which it is not), but that another book called \\"Battle Royale\\" exists. Battle Royale is a Japanese novel about an oppressive Orwellian gov't pitting 15-16 year old children in a fight to the death, roughly 42 at a time. Oh it was released in 1999.   Battle Royale covers much more philosophical elements, as well as less cookie cutter characters, and ups the gore factor a bit more than Hunger Games. All in all, a bit more mature read than Hunger Games.   However, thats not to say Hunger Games is bad; its really not. Collins created a strong female lead character, which is admirable, but unfortunately set her up with a doofus of a male partner. The love/romance scenes often felt forced, like Collins wasn't sure how she wanted it to turn out (she never really decides in this book by the way), but shot herself in the foot by making it a crucial element of the story. The story itself, although it reeks of familiar territory for those who have read Battle Royale, 1984, Brave New World, etc. ,  is fairly entertaining, and doesn't trip over itself with any inconsistencies. There are subtle hints at the true depth that the game should bring out in the characters, but overall I felt development was very lacking, and most of the \\"career\\" players were very static.   Overall, a good thrilling read for a young child, but if you are older than a pre teen and enjoy reading, you could easily forgo this book for the vastly superior Battle Royale. I would also say this book would be a good introduction to Battle Royale as well (if you like this book, definitely pick up BR).
B000VDDDY6|3.0|The primary objection that I have with this series is they only allow playing single episodes rather than playing the whole sequence of episodes on a disk.  There is no 'Play All' episodes mode, and each episode must be selected in a two-step selection process delayed by complex presentation graphics.  As a standard feature, I believe that all multi-episode DVDs should support remote skipping and fast forward/reverse play between episodes as well as within episodes so that a whole disk can be viewed as if it were one long movie.  I do not discount the utility of an episode selection mode, but I do not think that this should be provided without a general 'Play All' mode as well.  The reverse is true also.   I think this is just one of those cases where a product has unthinkingly been made more difficult to use.

B001PPGAJE|5.0|I was looking to fill up my Blu-Ray collection a bit, and ran across this movie during the Christmas sales this year. I got it for five bucks, and that price, how can you go wrong? =)  That said, this is what's considered X-Men 1.5. It has some extra features on a second Blu-Ray disc included; so if you don't already own X-Men, this is the copy you want to purchase. If you have the original version, then this may still be worth it if you're going to Blu-Ray. If you have it in Blu-Ray without the extras, might not be worth it.  Image quality is great, sound quality is great, everything is great really. =) I've already watched it a few times, and I'm sure it'll stay in regular rotation.
0811871258|5.0|I love this artbook since it collects the many works of James Jean! I first learned about his art from Fables and then became interested in his studio work afterwards.

The book is very sturdy and the pages have a golden edge that make it perfect! A great present for anybody who likes art!!!

It felt very real, honest and really dove into Grohl's musical career. He gave great access for the documentary and didn't pull any punches or try to smooth rough edges or hide anything.  Grohl and Foo Fighters have grown over the course of their seven albums, and it's all documented here. I can see myself watching this multiple times, and getting more out of it from each watching.

B004EPYZSU|3.0|What impresses most about \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" is not the special effects - or even Olivia Wilde's blue eyes which could quite literally level entire continents with a single glance (how the camera adores this woman) - it's the sheer presence of Daniel Craig. How did he get this cool all of a sudden? And there's even a convincing chemistry between him and Olivia Wilde that should be enough to worry Rachel Weisz. But for me that's where the good news peters out...<br /><br />I suspect like a lot of movie lovers, I was really looking forward to \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\". But it just somehow feels like \\"Captain America\\" or \\"Green Lantern\\" - two of the lamest comic-book adaptations of 2011. In fact you just wish Hollywood would leave these easy sources alone and reach for something exciting and new - genuinely original even.<br /><br />One upside however is the superb ensemble cast - veterans include the ever watchable Harrison Ford as ruthless rancher Woodrow Dolarhyde who is at logger-heads with Keith Carradine - the put-upon Sheriff of Absolution - a frontier town in the Wild West of 1873. The younger blood is supplied by Sam Rockwell as a bar-owning doctor - with Paul Dano as Woodrow's mouthy gun-wielding trouble-attracting son (he was the preacher boy in \\"There Will Be Blood\\"). Noah Ringer is a scared kid and there's nice work from Abigail Spencer and Ana De La Reguera as a prostitute and wife. But best of all is Clancy Brown as the town preacher Meacham trying to explain to the town's frightened populace what the alien 'machines' mean (he was the corrupt guard Bryon Hadley in the mighty \\"Shawshank Redemption\\"). He gives the piece a badly needed earthiness and heart.<br /><br />But \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" should of course be a special-effects bonanza with a howdy-dowdy twist - yet the CGI is underwhelming and even hammy. The pace also slows a lot, it's overly long and there are outdoors battle scenes towards the end in the daylight that resemble a bad B-movie set. In fact I think maybe the effects are part of the problem - not enough of them - not impressive enough. Sure in some instances the Alien creatures look suitably nasty and icky (like oversized grasshoppers) - but in others they actually look ludicrous...and that can't be good. It's a shame because the story's not half bad and unfolds nicely - but you can't help but feel that without 007's sheer star quality, there'd be little actually worth watching.<br /><br />The BLU RAY picture is sharp (as you'd expect from a movie of this size) and the 5.1 soundtrack rattles around your speakers with impressive clarity - but the picture never rises up above the merely good - and instead of thrilling me to the core - the explosions irritated after a while in their desperate over-the-top need to impress. The extras also give away way too much of what is good in the film (so don't watch them first).<br /><br />\\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" is fun in places for sure, but it's a 3-star underachiever that ultimately leaves you wondering why Director Jon Favreau couldn't have delivered more given the great canvass he had...<br /><br />I suggest rent rather than buy.of the problem - not enough of them - not impressive enough.

B003Y5H556|4.0|The story is well known, and yes, while the director of this film is the same as the first TWILIGHT movie, and the atmosphere may be similar, the comparisons should stop at that point. I do not believe this is intended for the \\"teen or 'tween\\" set as described in the narrative about the film.  The love story is nowhere near the same as the Twilight series, and the werewolf does not sparkle, and is not attractive in its appearance as opposed to say, Taylor Lautner.  What this movie does do, is create a wonderful atmosphere, to tell a fabled fairytale with a devilish twist.  Oldman is superb; but so is Billy Burke as our damsel in distress' father. Burke gives a captivity performance, much the same as he does in all the Twilight movies...each time he is on the screen, he steals the scene.  Not to mention him in the general review is a travesty. The acting is well supported by the cast, and gives credible and believable performance in their rolls. The lead character, our damsel, could have gone the way of Bella in Twilight and just be annoying...she is not. She adds a depth and believability to the roll, and her love not just for her one true love, but also her affection becomes evident for her selected would be husband. Yes, Oldman is sinister, and he plays sinister all too well, but you even have pathos for his character as more about his past is revealed. Julie Christie gives a very memorable performance as the grandmother...you know \\"what big teeth you have, etc.\\"  All the roles in this film could have been played over the top, and yet each actor stops short so that the film is believable and not a cliche. If only Hardwick had done the same with Twilight #1, perhaps it could have been truer to the book, and not filled with teen angst.  This is an outstanding horror movie, worth owning and watching. The end may surprise you.

B000J6I0PM|5.0|I was the typical \\"casual\\" fan of the Foos for many years.  If they came on the radio, I never turned it off.  But, I never really sought out their music, either.  I started hearing them more and more because my 19 year old son LOVES them.  Then, I saw the roc doc \\"Back and Forth\\", on Paladia, bought \\"Wasting Light\\" (CD), and \\"Live from Wembley\\" (DVD), and I've been making up for lost time ever since (who says teenagers can't teach us anything?).<br /><br />I am a big fan of stripped-down, acoustic music, so when I saw part of this DVD at a friend's house, I knew I had to have it.  This is an amazing show, on it's own, but it's really cool when you pair it with \\"Wembley\\" to see both sides of these guys in concert.  S&B is no less powerful than Wembley, but in a very different way (similar to Scorpions' Wacken and Acoustica).  If you're into the Foos (or just starting to), I highly recommend both discs.<br /><br />One quick warning to those who are sensitive to swearing, or have small children in the house, Dave Grohl uses the \\"F\\" word like most people use \\"and\\" in both concerts.  It's obviously just him being very stoked, but it may disturb some folks.

B005J4TLN4|4.0|Have you ever come across a movie that you've never heard of, starring nobody you've ever seen, with a plot that sounds like it would never work? Well if you haven't before, you have now. The 2011 low budget sci-fi, horror film 'Attack the Block' will surprise you at every turn. You'll start out hating the main characters, a bunch of arrogant teenage thugs terrorizing the streets of a rundown south London neighborhood, but when a bunch of hairy apelike aliens with florescent fangs land in the area you'll find yourself quickly won over by their courage and bravado. When these guys talk about protecting the block they mean it.<br /><br />While the cast is, as already mentioned a group of newcomers, they do a commendable job making this rather outlandish plot come across as believable and exciting. The lead role of Moses is played by a young Denzel Washington look-a-like named John Boyega who turned out to be impressive in a rather understated way. Boyegas' slow transformation from unlikeable hoodlum to intelligent anti-hero is wonderfully subtle and supplies an excellent counterbalance to the fast paced, helter skelter plot and action sequences. Definitely a surprising little film with an absolutely killer ending. I have a strong feeling this one will become a cult classic.

B0056BU3I2|2.0|It was an entertaining movie and I'd watch it again, because of the action.  I found the dialog to be a bit corny and some of the behavior unnecessary (you found the hideout and they're on satellite.  Is it necessary to be fly'n thru the streets and bouncing around in your armored cars to get to their location?)
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|this movie is awesome. i thought that this movie was just as good as the first movie. happy feet two had more of a storyline that the first but i thought that they both are really good. in all honesty if they make another movie they probably ruin it. so i hope they don't. but if they do i will see it anyways. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.

B00000JLWW|5.0|I was looking for this movie for a while but it was not available at any store I went to. Decided to try Amazon, and there it was. I finally found it on DVD, and got it for a gift and the owner of the movie loves. DVD works perfectly and its an original copy. Movie arrived very fast and in great condition like promised. The movie included the gold sleeve where the DVD case goes in. If you like this movie and are not able to find it , i recommend getting it from here, since it is not sold at many store.

B000FC1MCS|5.0|This book is written from the point of view of a young (dare I say \\"high functioning\\") autistic boy.      I know three families with autistic children.  All three families are as protective of their children as possible.  Despite the fact that I do have some interraction with one of these children.  I have not even a concept of the day to day experience.  Well, here it is.  This book provides the day to day routines and complications of an autistic person.  And it is done with such dignity and style that it is most heartbreaking.  The characters are all vividly shaped and consistent.  The occurrances are so well developed that I never questioned them.  In fact, the book is so well written that I often forgot that I was not reading a book written by a young autistic boy.  The book is enganging and fast paced.  Obviously the author has worked closely with autistic children and has a great respect for them.  This book is a must for anyone who believes that having compassion and understanding makes us more fully human.    Entertainment at its best !     Haddon offers a peek behind a veil and shows us what we never could imagine.    p.s. I read this as an e-book from my public libary, so anyone pouting about Kindle prices should visit their public library.

B000002AHC|4.0|The Byrds at their creative peak resulting in a brilliant yet flawed effort.  Producer Gary Usher created the appropriate sound world in which countrifed steel guitars mix harmoniously with psychedelic electric guitars but the Byrds' famous vocal harmonies suffer as a result.  Part of this may have been due to David Crosby's dismissal partway through production or perhaps not. As it is, the mix of vocals sounds mostly like Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman harmonizing in a sort of layer-cake of sound that mimics the droning of jet engines that McGuinn talks about in the liner notes of the first album.  On this album the jet-drone sounds a bit thin.  That said, this a wonderfully inventive album that abounds with creative confidence and compares favorably with the Beatle's &#34;Sgt. Pepper.&#34;  Missing from this reissue is &#34;Flight 713&#34; an instrumental layed down by McGuinn, Hillman and session man Jim Gordon during recording sessions for this album.  The tune is worth having and available on &#34;Never Before.&#34;  Gordon also played drums in place of Michael Clarke on McGuinn's magnum opus &#34;Get to You&#34; as well as &#34;Goin' Back&#34;, &#34;Natural Harmony&#34;, and &#34;Wasn't Born to Follow&#34; and makes one wonder how much better this record would have been had Gordon done all the percussion.<br /><br />By the time of the album's release the buying public had moved on to newer bands and as a result &#34;Goin' Back&#34; flopped as a single and album sales were disappointing.  Too bad, because with or without David Crosby (and for that matter Gene Clark, who reportedly co-wrote &#34;Get to You&#34; and sings harmony on one or more tunes) the band was at its creative peak.  One can only speculate what might have been had the Byrds' next album been the electrified jazz concept album McGuinn planned rather than the rustic 1950's country-and-western stylings of &#34;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&#34; an even bigger sales disappointment.  In any event, &#34;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&#34; continues to sell and how many bands from the sixties can that be said about?  McGuinn, the only Byrd to play on every Byrds' album, rates &#34;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&#34; as his personal favorite.us Byrd Brothers&#34; continues to sell and how many bands from the sixties can that be said about?

B005J3IEZQ|4.0|I'm 24. I got an ipod the same year I started at university. I used iMacs at school, and the iPhone was the first smartphone I ever got. I was a casual fan of Apple. I knew the stuff they produced was awesome, but refused to be part of the hype.<br /><br />I knew that everyone loved him, so I assumed that he was one of those guys that never seemed to do anything wrong. I was really shocked when I read this book.<br /><br />The biographer went to a great effort to be true to the person, rather than gloss over some of the negative aspects. It made for a really compelling read and I loved it. I was able to get inside the mind of someone who has had a massive influence over my industry and changed how I access information.<br /><br />Some of the stuff Jobs talked about conflicted with the minimal viable concept recommended in the Lean Startup. I'd love to see someone explore that concept, as this book made me lean towards Steve's tendency to wait until a product is as friendly as possible before releasing it.<br /><br />I think that most people will be really surprised when they read this book. It's a long slog, and the final chapters feel a bit rushed, but it's totally worth it.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005ASGG The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]] is a great film.<br /><br />Hey, it's a John Ford movie with Jimmy Stewart in the lead role (sorry, Duke) and Lee Marvin as the Bad Guy. What a cast! Support from the John Ford cadre of western movie actors, plus a wonderful part for Woody Strode, playing Wayne's handyman Pompey.<br /><br />There is so much stuff in this film, and Ford did a great job balancing the different sub-plots. I really recommend people take a hard look at the range-war/statehood story that is the motivation for the entire movie. Certainly, it's fiction, but the key aspects of the story are based on very real issues that were part of developing the West. Ford really captured the old-timey unsophistication of 19th-century territorial conventions.<br /><br />\\"Liberty Valance\\" is one of Ford's last films. Made in 1961/62, it's shot in B&W, which must have seemed quite anachronistic. With 2011 hind-sight, it fits in with Ford's early great westerns, including the original \\"Stagecoach.\\"<br /><br />I completely recommend this movie. It holds it's own with the other great westerns made by Ford and Howard Hawks.

0385738773|1.0|There comes a point at which a reader reaches a limit--when the author tests and strains the reader's patience and finally breaks it.  For me, it was in the second third of this book, after the lead character gets shot, recovers, gets shot again, and then shoots one of his friends.  (These are, mind you, teenagers.)  At some point, this stops being dystopian, and starts just being torture and masochism masquerading as fiction.  And this author purposelessly crosses that line over again over again in this third book--beyond the shooting, there are decapitations, poisoning, dementia, hangings, mutilation, and, of course, good old fashioned beatings.  PARENTS BEWARE.  And the above isn't even the worse part--after all, one could argue Lord of the Flies shared a number of same themes (albeit better written.)  The most egregious of The Death Cure's many faults is the supremely poor plot and denounement.  After the first two novels where there is no closure, not even direction, or a hint of explanation to the cause (and solution) to the dystopian future, the author apparently gave up and simply stuck a big \\"just because\\"--why does the hero survive the shootings, but not all of his sidekicks?  Because the cabal intends it so.  Why are they lead along a zombie (yes zombies!) trail only to be picked up by a deus ex machina device after they've struggled?  Because.  How did the hero get some of the answers and not the other crucial parts from his captors?  Because.  This book requires more suspension of disbelief than most religious texts.  The best part is the ending, which I won't spoil, but puts LOST to shame in the shaggy dog camp.    Both of the above would be ok, if this book weren't so terribly paced and written.  Along the way, I lost count of the number of black-outs the lead character undergoes--this seems to be the only way the author know how to end a chapter.  The characters speak in cliches and behaves in entirely unrealistic ways--the hero spending nearly halfthe book pining--and chasing after--one of the other main characters, only to abruptly change his mind during a telepathic seance, and afterwards falling entirely for the other girl.    There are so many things wrong with this series, it's shocking it can be categorised as fiction, let alone under young adult.  I ordinarily would view this with an open mind and say, well, the Maze Runner was wonderful, so stay away only from Death Cure.  But this book is so mean, so base, so trying, that it has changed my feeling on the whole series.  I really do hope the author grows and expands upon his creative side but gains a degree of humanism and compassion for the next series.

1936719118|4.0|I would always read about Derek Sivers. His name would come up in lifestyle design and entrepreneurship blogs but I didn't really know what he did. I've never bought from CDBaby and intentionally try not to get all fangirl on 'popular bloggers.'<br /><br />You know what? I loved this book. It felt like a guilty pleasure - a blend between The Lean Startup, Rework and Delivering Happiness. It had all the best parts from some of my favourite books without the jargon that makes me want to skim.<br /><br />Derek talked about the approach he took to his business. He kept things simple and did what felt right, rather then what was expected. I've really struggled when building my modest online business.

B000JLSM00|5.0|29-Dec-2011<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000JLSM00 The Searchers [Blu-ray]]] is a must-have for people who are serious about knowing and understanding Western movies. This is John Wayne's favorite \\"John Wayne movie,\\" and his acting is superb.<br /><br />The scenery of \\"The Searchers\\" is beautiful. Monument Valley doesn't have anything to do with cattle ranching - dude, it's DESERT - but so what? We're watching either the actors, or the sweeping landscapes. The color is absolutely true to life - the sky is blue, the scrufty plants are varying shades of green, and everything else is red. It feels a lot like being dropped onto Mars.<br /><br />The cast is fabulous - John Ford's cadre of western regulars is very well represented. None of them (except Wayne and possibly Ward Bond) were capable of carrying even a minor movie, but as an ensemble they all do their jobs to perfection. My favorite among the supporting cast is Bond - a perennial Wayne sidekick - playing Rev. Capt. Samuel Johnston Clayton, the preacher who is also a Captain in the Texas Rangers.<br /><br />If you haven't seen The Searchers, you're in for a real treat. I absolutely recommend it.<br /><br />[I've read a couple reviews complaining that the Blu-Ray transfer isn't wide-screen. There is a really great reason: John Ford didn't have what we would think of as wide-screen cameras. (See what I mean about knowing about movies?) In 1991, I stayed at Goulding's Lodge, the hotel in the middle of Monument Valley, which is where a number of Ford's movies were shot. The Searchers was made 40 years earlier in somewhat cruder conditions; it isn't any particular wonder if at times it appears bit grainy on a high-res display.]
0439023513|2.0|I just have to say, for all of those people who are commenting on people wanting a fairy tale, I have to say, this is not black or white.  I don't think any of us are expecting a fairy tale.  If so, we would have given up on the Hunger Games.  What we want is more development, more showing, less telling.  It doesn't have to be either a fairy tale or a completely depressing burned out mess.    ***Spoiler Alert***  I agree with what a lot of people are saying: The ending was rushed, the numbness of Katniss made the book fall flat, the character development was practically non-existant, a lot of things just didn't make sense.    I get why the author chose to go that way, but I can't agree with her decision to do so.  PTSD does not, in the end, make a person ok with people making decisions for them.  The abuse that Katniss suffered through would have yes, given her nightmares, made her numb at times, made her appear crazy ... but it also would have given her a resilient spirit, made her a survivor who felt the full injustice of being played, and she would have been ANGRY enough for us to feel the fire of that so much that it would have lifted us up out of the depths that was so much a part of this book.  For one small moment, it happens.  Katniss is on fire again!  And then she goes back to doing pretty much nothing.  The realization that she had been played should have been realized sooner and her methods of justice explained.  Katniss is a survivor, independent, completely able to be one of those heroes that war does turn out.  Katniss was the face of the revolution, but in the end she was described as mentally unstable in order to get off for killing Coin.  So the revolution was fired up by a girl who was unstable?  What does that say about those who were inspired by her?  And being hospitalized so much and drugged?  Guess what?  I have PTSD and I've NEVER been hospitalized.  I've been close.  I've wished I was, but it is possible to make it through without once ending up in a hospital or resorting to drugs.  Now I can understand past victors going crazy.  They were traumatized far beyond the arena.  And yes, so was Katniss.  Seeing that much horror can unhinge a person, which begs the questions ... can one man really yield that much power?  Can one woman?  How does Coin convince anyone to take a 13-year-old girl to the frontlines?    The ending was definitely rushed.  I think what happened is that this revolution, finally seeing it all happen, was such a huge plot point that it was too hard to wrap up in such a short amount of space or time.  It seems the saying is true -- Katniss: The Girl Who Was on Fire, WAS being the word I want to stress here.  The Mockinjay title became a joke to me.  The few on fire moments were when Katniss stopped being what people tried to make her and became herself.  What was unreal was when she became what people said she was.  I hardly cared about any of the characters past what I remember of them in the first two books.  The scope and idea of the story was simply beyond the length that a trilogy would allow.  This should have gone into a fourth book, a book that would allow Katniss to come into her own and defy all who would make her into something she is not.  That is what happens when you grow as a person during triumph and tragedy.  You find who you are.  You don't let them break you.  Katniss could have been a leader.  Just because she wasn't a good speaker for interviews didn't mean she couldn't get her point across.  There was so much setup for the abuse of power in 13, and it practically went nowhere.    Peeta was with the capitol, being brainwashed, for about six weeks?  he was brainwashed off of footage they had of Katniss and by tracker jacker venom.  They manipulated his mind, but he goes from fighting this, knowing the truth deep down, to being completely overcome by it.  How much of Peeta's and Katniss' relationship was on video?!?!?!?  They can't mess with memories they don't knowabout.  So his succombing and being turned completely against her was not realistic.  People are immensely complex.  Even if you have every reason to hate someone, there is still a part of you that unconditionally loves them or is loving to them.  I don't buy that, knowing what the capitol was doing to Johanna, that he could believe in an evil Katniss spun by the capitol.  And what on earth even happened to Johanna?  She just drops off for the battle?  She just disappears, as does Annie.  And Haymitch.  Why?    I can, I suppose, understand why a 17-year-old Katniss would become just another soldier, no one special unless she can do something for the movement.  After all, she's just a kid, but making that decision takes Katniss out of the real action.  In the end, what was her mission for?  All of those people with her really did die for nothing.  What did she accomplish by being in the capitol?  Nothing.  Other than maybe to bring Peeta back from the brink slightly.  What does shooting out building windows do for the movement?  You can still have a realistic story and breed hope.  People continue to dream and hope and build lives that have happiness even in the ashes of tragedy.  They laugh, they cry, they love in a way that doesn't leave the reader feeling hollow.    So, here is what I think should have happened given the turn of events.  If we cannot have our victor Katniss, she should have died in the first games.  The book should have ended with her death, the second picking up from the aftermath from Primrose's point of view.  What Katniss did for Primrose was cheapened by Primrose's death, but if Katniss had died, it would have packed a punch.  It would have then been up to Primrose to carry on her sister's legacy.  SC recognized something in Mockingjay, that a martyr can do more for the cause than someone who is alive, especially someone who is not being a leader.  Her failure was set up from book two, when Haymitch remarks that Katniss can't make decisions.She is referred to as brainless, not smart enough to be included in the command decisions.  He was wrong, and it seems like SC's opinion sided with Hatmitch. Even when she is assigned to a squad in command, it's such a joke. So give those decisions to Primrose, a girl who is aware, smart, strong, and quite able to take care of herself.  Let her be the leader of the resistance behind Katniss' face, and then everything that Katniss believed in would be alive and on fire, not fizzling.  I do feel like Katniss died in the first book.  Maybe if she had, there would be more action and less fluff.  She doesn't even get a clue when Plutarch shows her his Mockingjay.  They don't let her in on anything, and she doesn't find out anything.  She's clueless, and it's frustrating when I know more than she does.  Or ... the series should have had a fourth book.  Prim would have been the martyr for the cause, the catalist needed to bring back Katniss' fire, and the fourth book would have included bringing down 13.  After all, why should it be 13's law that stands?  Why is it that Katniss has to bargain for their lives?  13 has no more right than 8 or 4 or 11 to make the decisions of war.  Katniss started the revolution.  She should have ended it, too.  In the end, I was disappointed.  I didn't like Katniss.  Prim had been \\"off-screen\\" so much that, while I was shocked by her death, I wasn't devastated.  I was more torn up by the small moment when Katniss actually grieves.  And we barely see that.  You know, if Katniss is going to be affected so much by all of the tragedy, show it.  Don't just make her numb.  That isn't how it works.  The only great moment in Mockingjay is when Katniss turns and shoots Coin.  By this point, the fire has gone out so much for Snow that I can't even root for his death, and I was grimacing, hoping she wouldn't do it, and then she shoots Coin and I'm cheering, and then ... nothing.  We hear about all of the action later and all of the people who are involved in that are off screen and practically unknown.  People with PTSD do get burned out, but there are things that continually set them on fire again.  Injustice, abuse, a deliberate murder, etc.  And we are pretty darned vocal about those things, to the point where most people will just call us crazy.  Katniss had a voice.  She should have used it.  But her voice and spirit both died, and that is only half of the story.
B00664AM5C|5.0|i found this to be a good film....really got into watching it....the story line was captivating and engrossing my fav chacter was  Kate Winslet great film
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This was a gift to my son. He loves Harry Potter and here in this collection all the movies are together in one package.  As always, ordering and shipping on Amazon is a breeze and the products are as promised. Will continue to order from Amazon.
1935670913|3.0|My initial impressions of this book wasn't positive. Poorly structured, excessive punctuation and a lot of hype that would make anyone in the internet marketing industry cringe. But, once stripped to the basics, it was actually rather useful.<br /><br />It felt like he spent far too long getting into the 'system' of the book, despite his claims that this was short. He took several page to establish credibility when, really, his sales figures were enough. He also had some basic Q&A answers - some of which I felt gave the audience false hope.<br /><br />Once I eventually got to the system though, I was intrigued. It's very similar to the work I do as part of blogger outreach.  As a social media professional, there was a lot of things I disagreed with and believe are outdated. Yet other strategies, such as posting less regularly and putting more effort in to encourage people to share it, are ones that are currently working for many of my peers.<br /><br />People who already understand social media will be able to instantly understand the system. Those who don't may need to do more research on twitter best practices.<br /><br />I believe that the low price point makes this good investment for those researching kindle publishing. You can skim the boring bits and focus on what is relevant to you.
B006IW8DJE|4.0|In 1992 Finnish director Aki Kaurism&auml;ki made his first French movie, \\"La Vie de Boh&egrave;me\\", and now almost 20 years later he returns with a second French-language movie.<br /><br />\\"Le Havre\\" (93 min.) centers around the ordinary lives of people like Marcel Marx (which character incidentally also appears in La Vie de Boheme and where he also was played by Andr&eacute; Wilms). Marx tries to get by as a shoe-shiner, but life is hard. The house he and his wife Arletty have is modest at best. Then one day a group of illegal immigrants from Gabon are found in a container waiting to be shipped to London. A teenage boy manages to escape the police and eventually the boy and Marcel Marx link up. I don't want to spoil the plot any further than this, you'll just have to see how it all plays out for yourself.<br /><br />This is not an \\"action\\" movie. Instead, it observes the ordinary lives of ordinary people, and in addition it is a love note of sorts to the city of Le Havre, which, like the characters in this movie, has seen better days but remains resilient. This movie was very well received at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, and it is easy to see why. The acting is superb throughout, none better than by lead actor Andr&eacute; Wilms. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish, but obviously this is not for anyone in a hurry or looking for the next Harry Potter franchise. Highly recommended!
B000HIVOI2|5.0|Great movie that is even better on Blue-ray! The extended cut makes watching this enjoyable, i found myself saying \\"i don't remember that scene\\" lol
B005NF2UE6|5.0|Great album, but I love Nickleback!  I receive this CD as a gift for Christmas, and I have not stopped listening to it since then.  I loaded it on my Iphone so I can listen to it at work or where ever, and I have the CD in my car.  I would recommend it, but again I like Nickleback!
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Each song is simply amazing. Incredibly linked,  slow and moving, not young-money sounding at all, which is a plus. Drake paints a picture or something wonderful and yet sorrowful and mysterious at the same time.
0399536108|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Chris Guillebeau. I love his work and believe that this book has the power to change a lot of lives.<br /><br />As someone that followers him closely, through his blogs and interviews, I didn't learn all that much. That's fine, as I'm not the target demographic. Those who, like me, are avid readers of his work may feel like they are re-reading stuff, even though it's new content.<br /><br />Still, it's a fantastic book. The structure is brilliant considering his essays vary wildly in theme. I think it can be really valuable to those who are interested in lifestyle design but aren't into the hype of the four hour work week. It's also useful for those who feel different from the typical business owner, but aren't sure what to do.<br /><br />I recommend it for those wanting to embrace the unique elements of their business.
0345479092|1.0|I read this book after my daughter was born and decided to try to implement some of it.  The EASY plan did not work for me because I was breastfeeding, and both my pediatrician and my lactation consultant said that it was of utmost importance to breastfeed on demand and not on a schedule, not only so my baby could thrive and grow, but also so that I could establish a good milk supply.  Also the \\"Y\\" in EASY for \\"you\\" was completely unrealistic with my colicky girl in the first three months.  I think it at best creates unrealistic expectations and at worst can lead to failure to thrive.  I also was irritated at her claims that breastfeeding was a trend -- she seemed to be pushing people toward formula or encouraging them to give up on breastfeeding.  I think formula is great for moms who cannot breastfeed or need to supplement, but the AAP and many other organizations have made it clear that breastfeeding is best.  Breastfeeding was REALLY hard for me (and I didn't have any undersupply issues); the last thing I needed was a book that implied that I should give up and formula feed instead.  I'm glad I stuck with it, as it has gotten much easier over time.  This book was also badly edited and incredibly condescending.  She speaks in a flippant tone, calling the reader \\"luv\\" throughout.  She provides no medical research to support her claims.  It also isn't clear to me what her qualifications are for writing this book.  Definitely one to skip -- could actually be harmful to read.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|I bought this for the wife who has ever know format of this movie and remakes, old and new, as well.  She loves how clear it is. Great resolution but that is what you expect from a blue ray version
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Great CD, great music!  I have not checked out the Digital booklet part yet, I just loaded it to my Iphone so I could take the music where ever I go and put the CD in my car for on the road.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Very addicting and easy to learn how to play.  I like it so much I'm playing it for the second time on my new transformer prime!
0071373586|4.0|Describes an approach to creating a \\"position\\" in a prospective customer's mind - one that reflects a company's own strengths and weaknesses and those of its competitors. This book shows readers how to reposition a strong competitor and create a weak spot, use the present position to its best advantage, and choose the best name for a product.<br /><br />The content is amazing, but very poorly structured. He gives the basic theory and then focuses on traps and case studies. It is a brilliant text, and I learned a lot, but I had no idea what to do with the information after I'd read it.<br /><br />I recommend it because positioning is something you need to know, and this book is very matter of fact. You'll just need to do the work to apply it to your business.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game... like all the options that goes with the game. Not sure what hubby does different on his phone but he always scores higher... lol
B004XWLN20|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son.  He was delighted to receive it.  He loved and commented the way the product was packaged.  I recommend it to anybody that wants to purchase it.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great product for the whole family.  Hogwarts has never been so alive as this 8 disc set chronicles the life and times of Harry Potter.  A must have for anyone.
0545265355|4.0|I haven't read this set of books, so I can't comment on the stories, but it looked like something my oldest daughter would enjoy.  When I went to the stores to buy the books, I noticed the boxed set of the trilogy was pretty expensive.  I checked around at several stores, then tried Amazon.  The cost was half what I found at bookstores and department stores.  They arrived in about a week with standard shipping, the shipping was free, and the books were brand new.  Good deal, good price!
B000EXDS5M|5.0|The extra stuff with this disk was really great...Interviews with cast from the 90s and again more up to date.  Loved finding out all the stuff behind the scenes.  This movie will never grow old and the background was fascinating...Loved it.
B005I6EU48|4.0|I love the look of this classy-looking Kindle Fire cover. The feel of it gives me the illusion of holding onto a real book, which is one of the things I missed most when using my Kindle Keyboard. That said, it turns out that I'm using my Kindle Fire more for viewing TV shows and videos, so one additional function I'd like from this cover is a way to fold it over and use it as a stand without compromising the spine of the cover or using a complex arrangement of my purse and other possessions to prop it up at just the right angle.  I can't imagine it would be very difficult to modify in this way, as there are many other similar covers that do exactly that. They just aren't as lovely to look at, which is why I chose this one.   On certain surfaces I manage to get it to stand by folding the cover over backward, but since this wasn't the original design, I'm afraid it is going to cause faster wear and tear on the cover. But I'd still buy it again, for its classy, old book style. And it's surprisingly sturdy as well. So, I give it 4 stars for design and sturdiness. If it had a design feature that enabled it to be used as a stand as well, I'd give it 5.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I was interested in a sharpener for a personal pocket knife and to fix up a nice Gerber that went through a lot with me while I was in the military. This one looked simple and had a great price, so I decided to give it a shot. The Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener completely did the trick. I wasn't expecting much to happen, but I was proven wrong. This product is a QUALITY item and a MUST HAVE. Very easy to use! I do have to warn buyers about the size of the sharpener, though. It is only about 3-4 inches long BE VERY CAREFUL holding it while sharpening your knives (as you should already be careful because you are using a knife). Overall, I will easily recommend this item to my military friends and the Amazon community. Enjoy and be careful.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|this movie is another great from Tim Burton. Hadn't seen it prior to purchasing I just had faith & wasn't disappointed
B005POK858|5.0|This is a very simple, yet enjoyable JRPG. Highly recommended. Interesting skill upgrade system allows for very customizable characters. Approximate play-time, 10-hours.
1439108277|5.0|I can't remember having so much fun, feeling so excited and learning as much as I did reading this book!! Walter Lewin's enthusiasm for physics leaps off every page. I could sense his excitement, passion and energy with every page, and I love the feel of his Dutch accent; it made the book even more intimate and engaging. However, no reader will be simply engaged, but completely and wholly sucked in and feeling like someone just shared with you all the secrets of the universe (which Dr. Lewin actually does!). Of course you will learn a tremendous amount about physics, the world around you and the answers to a whole host of \\"why\\" questions, but I also found his enthusiasm rubbing off on me and I finished this book with a renewed sense of being more enthusiastic about life in general and vowed to look at everything with such marvel and wonder.<br /><br />My 9-year old son absolutely loved this book as well. Young or old, this is a wonderful book on so many levels; taking a topic many find intimidating and making it accessible for anyone, it is Dr. Lewin speaking from the heart and sharing something truly wonderful with all of us. If you really want to see this book come alive, watch any of his lectures on MIT's website. Everyone should have a chance to experience a teacher like Dr. Lewin.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|A friend who loves comedies recommended this movie, so my husband and I watched it last night. Well, as far as storylines go, there's nothing new here. Justin Bateman plays Dave Lockwood, a successful, up and coming lawyer at a posh law firm. Dave is happily married to Jamie (Leslie Mann) and has a young daughter and infant twins. Then there's Dave's best friend, Mitch (Ryan Reynolds), who is a layabout and 'dabbles' in porn flicks.<br /><br />The story takes off after the drunk pair pee into a fountain one night, wishing that they could be the other person. Voila! Dave and Mitch end up switching bodies. This makes for some funny and yes, awkward moments, especially for Mitch who ends up living in Dave's house with Dave's family, sharing a bed and some uncomfortably intimate moments with Dave's wife. Dave in the meantime, finds out to his horror the degenerate lifestyle Mitch leads.<br /><br />The plot is predictable, and the saving grace is the hammy performances by both Bateman and Reynolds. There are some truly funny moments though, like when Dave (who is in Mitch's body) eagerly waits up for a romantic rendezvous with Mitch's regular Tuesday date (the boys have decided it is OK to have sex with the other's wife/ dates as they are technically in the other's body) and discovers the blond bombshell erm, has some hidden depths!<br /><br />I did feel there was too much profanity, unnecessary in my opinion. On the whole though , this is an average, light-hearted comedy made tolerable by Bateman's and Reynold's performances.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is the funnest game ever. a friend of mine told me to get it. and it is so fun. my kids, roommate and husband love it,, we have it on the ipods and our kindle fire. love it love it. so much fun.
B002ZG976U|3.0|I hate to admit, but I was turned off to seeing this in theaters based off of the critics reviews. However, I would recommend renting this movie if you are a Cher or Christina fan!  The costumes, dancing, singing... amazing. It was a visual treat. For that reason I gave it three stars.  The plot, like most others that rated it a three have said, was lackluster. Very predictable and too slow. If you caught the preview for this movie, you already know about 3/4 of the plot. The character roles were transparent from the minute you are introduced to them so in the same way you can figure out the ending quickly. However, the plot wasn't awful, and it really isn't the focus of the movie.  If you are interested in seeing great dancing and hearing great singing, this is a great movie to check out. If you are looking for a deep plot, skip it.
0385493819|5.0|Just an excellent read.  Uplifting story.  I honestly read this book in 3 days.  I was sad it was over.  I even have the audio book version and listened to it on a road trip to CO just to re-live the story in a different format.  Love this book!
0143038419|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, except for the rather boring \\"pray\\" part.  Looking back, the pray part will give you an education about yoga and meditation, and did have some interesting insights, but, for me, it was just rather boring.  The \\"Eat\\" and \\"Love\\" sections though, were wonderful and certainly worth reading.
B005ARYEPK|5.0|I never saw the original Footloose when it came out.  After seeing the new release and enjoying it tremendously I wanted to see the original.  I am glad I purchased it instead of renting it. Also my supplier was quick to get my movie to me. I've already loaned it to family to watch also. We are all enjoying it.
0307949486|1.0|This has got to be one of the strangest commercial successes out there.  This book is so clumsily structured that it begs for a re-write at the level of narrative organization.  It is also poorly written, with choppy sentences and paragaphs, and positively tedious dialogue.<br /><br />I'm also not sure the author knew who his protagonist was meant to be, or understood the nuts and bolts of character development.  Lizbeth is developed ineptly to the point of being a shoddily arranged composite of several different \\"types.\\"  Her actions throughout the book are not even remotely the actions of the person she is described to be. (Showing versus Telling 101 anyone?) After all, the girl who could pull off the business caper at the end of the novel is not the same person, as far as characters go, as the girl who is victimized early on. And the difference is not, I hasten to add, because of character development.  Rather, it is because she was so ill conceived that her actual capabilities in the story do not accord with the capabilities of the sullen outcast.  Again, early on in the book, when Lizbeth presents her investigative report, she expresses to her listeners her own opinion of the results.  Neither the language nor the confidence required to think and speak as she does jives with the sullen introvert we are told that she is.  These are elementary errors from a writer who needed to go back to the drawing board.<br /><br />In addition, the murder investigation, definitely the best part of the book, exposes an unnecessarily macabre climax. Reading this book reminded me that ratiocination, the process of discovery, rather than a gruesome death, is truly the heart of a good mystery.<br /><br />By the author of It All Started With a Bicycle
0199536619|3.0|The epitome of subjectivity in writing. At first, this makes for a very difficult read if you're not used to this stream of consciousness style (and I was not), but by the end of the book, you may wish every novel was written in this form. I have encountered few books that have so well invited me into the minds of its characters. Truly a journey to \\"the self,\\" the spotlight of consciousness.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|For you RoboCop fans this is your Trilogy.  I bought them not because they were Blu-Ray but because it was RoboCop.  Being that they were shot years ago, Blu-Ray really only helps in that they are not compressed to help a little in the way of picture quality.  So many reviewers thing that Blu-Ray means flawless picture!!  Not the case on a movie shot with old film and dust.  Buy this for the movies, not the fact they are Blu-Ray.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love this game it is a must for any gamer! All you have to do is simply blowup the pompous pigs with the &quot;angry birds&quot;! I my opinion choose this over the original. But this game is fun, addicting, and a essential!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|great app love being able to have all info in one place and don't have to worry losing paper notes and great for shopping list.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I was a little late to read this book after many friends raved about; just didn't think a \\"comedy\\" book was really my thing. All I can say is that I couldn't put it down once I started. My husband kept \\"shushing\\" me for lauging out loud. While I was reading the honeymoon cruise chapter I was crying and practically choking from laughing so hard!
0743297334|4.0|In Hemingway's classic Lost Generation trailblazer, the lifeless Jacob Barnes is a thirty something American living in post-World War I Europe. Barnes is an emotional desert, defeated by his physical injuries from the war and unable to please the love of his life, he sits idly by as the lovely Brett tramps about to both's unhappiness. His physiology goes unmentioned and begs the reader ask if his impotence is just a psychosomatic manifestation of a broken psyche. He and the other expatriates vamp around Europe and drink feverishly, reflecting their escapist desire for a never-to-be-found home-away-from-home.  Otherwise inert, Jake lives vicariously through the Spanish bull fights. Perhaps he is unconsciously drawn to them by their symbolic significance - triumph of man's nature over his impulsive animality; perhaps by the likeness of the fight's rhythms to his own unrequited game of love; or simply by its reputably macho and morbid allure - a palpable conflict of life and death. Hemingway's own fascination with the sport may be gleaned from his Death in the Afternoon: \\"Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter's honour.\\"  In this work, Hemingway's emblematic prose embodies the aridness of his characters. It also serves to place a sharp focus on the story and on the characters, rather than on flowery and shallow language.
0385535139|5.0|About the only book of his I have not read yet are the \\"Kid Lawyer\\" series.  I actually plan to read these too, I just have not sprung for them yet.  I don't have much to say other than it is like any John Grisham book I have ever read.  You pick it up, and you can't put it down.  Excellent read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game!! Have the Kindle Fire and the game works great. Haven't had any issues. I would recommend this game!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is exactly what it says it is. Sleek, tough and good-looking. My Kindle Fire took only a lttle convincing to snap in and will not accidently fall out.  The stand feature works well.  I don't use my kindle for movies or TV, but it still makes holding my Fire with one hand much less tiring.  I really chose this case because of its low profile.  It still fits in a jacket or large pants pocket with the case on. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a solid, sleek case for their Kindle Fire.  I will update this review if I start to experience any problems.
B004CIIXC8|4.0|This is a good movie if you know what to expect going in.  This movie is very edgy, to the point of being somewhat disturbing.  However, based on my experience, it is probably an extremely accurate portrayal of the bleak existence of lower income society in northern European countries (and a lot of the rest of the world.) Worth a watch, just be prepared.  It will go places you probably aren't expecting. Definitely not a \\"date night\\" movie.
0807014273|3.0|This two-part novel is written by a holocaust survivor and later psychologist of logotherapy. Frankl asserts as men, it is not our responsibility to understand fully the meaning of the world, or even to endure the meaningless of life; rather, as humans we must only bear the incapacity to grasp total meaning. Further, every trial encountered is an opportunity to show your character, and hence to assign meaning to your life.
B004856SQ8|5.0|I love this movie!  I saw it first in the theater and upon leaving I said to myself, once it is out on Blu-Ray I will buy this one.  I have watched it several times since.  The quality of the movie on Blu-Ray compliments my home theater setup.  I love this movie!  Even if you were not a fan or old enough to watch the A-Team you will like this movie.  You may not get some of the references (like BA's Van) but it is still cool none the less.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is a game of skill and concentration. a game of stradegy. I reccermend that anyone in the world should play this wonderful enjoyable fun game.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Great product for the money- good protector for a kindle fire. The cover is hard enough for good protection, but flexible enough to carry well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Makes you concentrate,while having fun. Once I start can not seem to quit. New way to play an old game.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|I really don't have anything bad to say about this game.  It is fun, Entertaining, and a joy to play.  The only issue that I have is I feel there should be something more to round this out into a Five star app. When I am done, I may or may not have a lot of money, but there is no &quot;reward&quot; for having more or less. I would like to see some upgraded boats, accessories, and new levels that could be bought with the winnings.
B00164GDD2|5.0|Having a 46\\" HDTV and a Blu-Ray player I had to get this.  Obviously the movie has artifacts due to it being shot back in the day, but with Blu-Ray you are not getting the compression etc.  It looks very nice and I love being able to watch this move on those days when nothing is on.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is a good game, but I am dissappointed that u don't have snuff village, the Sims play free, zombie farm, and other favorite apps. so please put those apps on here, and people will be happy.
B002ZG99TK|1.0|Bought this silly digital copy. Crashes, won't work, and I paid extra for this. Tried to use it on windows media player. Download time was 5 some hours but crashed after a few minutes. Tried to download it on my kendal. Waised a lot of time watching it download but it wasn't there. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY! YOU PAID FOR YOUR MOVIE WHY SHOULDN'T YOU BE ABLE TO WATCH IT ON EVERYTHING? i'LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER MOVIE!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|very fun gives a lot of option on what you want you like to play.  gives moreoptions then other games
B004YJMQCS|5.0|This review is confined mainly the the 3D effects,audio and video quality, and not to the movie itself.<br />Yes, the film will not appeal to many people due to its gory, bloody and disgusting nature. However, this blu ray edition is SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!!!<br />It appears that this movie was shot with the same 3D technology as that used for AVATAR. I don't know if this is true or not, but this movie simply pours out the best of 3D effects in every single bit! Almost every 5 min, something will pop out (truly, POP OUT!) of the screen, to satisfy your 3D cravings. In the scenes without 'pop-out' effects, the 3d is still brilliant. You can sense great depth in the frame. Try the opening scene in the stadium. You will literally feel the height, depth and layers of the stadium seats. The blu ray video quality is outstanding with breathtaking clarity and sharpness. Color saturation, contrast and overall quality of the HD transfer is nothing but best in every single scene.<br />Having owned many blu ray 3Ds, I can definitlety say that this blu ray 3D is THE Demo disc for your 3dtv system! This is almost equivalent to the Disney PIXAR Toy story 3 3D in terms of Full HD 3D presentation. Yeah, there is gore (and a lot of it), but if you are trying to see the limits of your 3D system, stop here. The audio is mind blowing, that can put you right in the middle of the scene. Simply brilliant by all means!<br />This disc includes the 2D version of the movie too, and for those who are wondering, this newer version of the blu ray is designed for today's 3D TVs. This blu ray does not have the red-blu 3D glasses. You can use it with your active (shutter) glasses (for those who have either Samsung or Sony). For one disc, the price is bit high (considering that you can get Disney's 4 disc sets in the same price range), but the 3D HD quality compensates for it.
0385508417|5.0|This book is great!  It is like Grisham took a vacation and just showed how good of a writer he is by writing this non-tradition book.  It is not a legal thriller or legal comedy.  It is a funny book about Christmas!  If you have seen \\"Christmas with the Kranks\\" you have read the book.  They were almost identical.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This is the album that got me into two steps from hell music, I don't like all the songs, but the songs that took a liking to me made buying the album justifiable.<br /><br />don't be afraid to buy this album if you are a student or lover of classic/orchestra music.<br /><br />Jump in, the sounds is just right.....
B005ZUR724|1.0|game does not allow you to join a server without. an update. just one problem, there is no update. This being a subscription based game, it's unacceptable to not be able to play. It's been a few days already!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun but some of the games are pretty hard though but other then that I am keeping it on my kindle
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game has no problems on a Kindle Fire and has very few ads.. nothing to get upset about. After all, it is the free game with advertisements! Even so, this is a game for all ages. An amazing game no doubt!!!
B0055PMURG|5.0|Incredible movie and very well acted by AnnaSophia Robb.  The blatant Christianity of the movie could at times get a little cloying but it's obviously part of who the Hamiltons are so it's understandable in the context of the movie.  Definitely worth seeing.
0307477479|3.0|I'm trying to put into words what I felt about this book. It wasn't easy reading for me, I must say that straight out. It was difficult to keep all the characters straight and some of them were not very likeable, although all of them were interesting.  The word \\"goon\\" from the title refers to time. In the past, goon squads referred to groups of violent thugs who would beat people up and in the book, one of the characters states, \\"Time's a goon, right?\\" It's actually quite sad as this quote refers to time robbing the characters of their youth. Many of the characters are/were in the music business, were wildly successful at one time, and as this book travels back and forth in time, we see that happiness and success are limited. Time on Earth is limited. We get old and things change.   This novel is a collection of stories, each with a different narrator and told in a different way. One of the chapters is written in powerpoint format. I must say this book is unique; I've never read anything like it. At times I had difficulty connecting with this novel, probably because each chapter was from a different point of view, but the characters were well-developed and it was definitely worth reading.
B004U52VPS|4.0|This game is alot of fun for all of us! I enjoy the building and my daughter loves knocking it down. She's 10 and is a fan of the online version so we thought we'd give it a try. It's very enjoyable!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I got this app for my kindle fire and I have really enjoyed it . Great way to kill time and the ad's. aren't annoying like some of the other apps I have gotten for free. So thanks for a really good game.
B002BJGYTY|4.0|Well I really enjoy Gilmore Girls and was happy to be able to buy the first 3 seasons on Amazon.com I was very disappointed when they arrived. Season three sounded broken. Thankfully when I opened it up the discs were intact but the plastic that holds all the discs together like a hinge was broken. I don't know if this is an amazon problem or a WB problem but it was disappointing all the same.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah's Key is a deeply touching and heartbreaking novel. It tells two intersecting stories of Sarah, a young Jewish girl in Paris during WWII and Julia, a French journalist (originally from America) in 2002 assigned to cover the story of the 60th anniversary of Vel' d'Hiv, when the French police rounded up and arrested the Jews from their homes during the Nazi occupancy. Tatiana de Rosnay brilliantly weaves the two stories together as Julia learns about Sarah and her family's plight during Vel' d'Hiv. The climax, when the stories come together and Julia learns what happened to Sarah and her family, is incredibly powerful. I learned a great deal about France and the French police during WWII that I hadn't known before reading this novel. It was fascinating, horrifying, and enlightening. This novel is a must read!
B0056BU3I2|5.0|AWESOME!! AWESOME!! FANTASTIC!! GREAT!! lol the best movie in the franchise besides the first one. Can't wait for the 6th one.
6303168507|1.0|We purchased this item for my husband's mother.  When we open the package, the two movies had been shoved in backwards.  It was difficult to get them out of the cover.  Then when we attempted to play them, the VCR just shut off.  The second tape I put in was eaten by the VCR.  Both tapes were cracked.  I know it was only .30, but it's the principal.  Don't sell trash to people.

B000FIMG68|5.0|The second season of LOST provides many questions for its fans. What is the Dharma Initiative? Where is the Island? Who are the Others? During this season viewers meet several new characters, say goodbye to others, learn more about the Island and the survivors of flight 815. Viewers also learn exactly what occurred during the plane crash and possibly why it crashed on the Island. Also, many more character flashbacks provide fans with more details about the survivors and their motivations to either stay on or leave the Island.<br /><br />Season two is full of conflict, twists, revealations and mysteries. It is the first time that viewers meet Desmond, encounter the Others, enter the hatch and start to understand its purpose. Most importantly, it is the first time that MICHAELmATICIAN's transmission \\"2.342\\" reached the Island's radio tower (more on that in season 3).<br /><br />-Jeremy Shingles
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I received the trilogy as a Christmas gift this year and have already read all three. The books are an easy read and Suzanne Collins does a great job of making the characters ones I could relate to.<br /><br />This book sets up the back story of Panem, the districts, and the history of the Hunger Games. The Capital controls the games and the districts, and the tributes in the arena are just kids. Collins starts the book off dramatically with the main character, Katniss, volunteering to go to the deadly Hunger Games in her little sister's place, and she manages to show the struggle for survival in the games while still trying to be a decent human being.  Katniss's little sister reminds me of my sister, so the story grabbed me from the beginning.<br /><br />I recommend the whole series, but have a box of tissues ready when you get to the last book.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Game worked and was fun until latest update that cannot be accessed via kindlle fire. Now this game will not work at all. Gameloft and Amazon took our money and delivered a non working product, which is a misrepresentation of their product and may result in a class action lawsuit. Very bad form from both companies.
0553807919|5.0|Every parent should buy this book. Siegel and Bryson do an excellent job of breaking down parenting as a process and not an event.<br /><br />They teach the reader how to navigate through the right brain, left brain model. So if your child is having a right brain meltdown, they teach you how to reach them there before you move to logic. Some parents will find that to be a basic skill, but many will find it very new and rewarding.<br /><br />Understanding the idea of an upstairs and downstairs brain is also a major accomplishment in this book. Most of the time, we as a people do not give thought to the why of what we do. This book helps explain a more integrated approach to parenting. One of the most controversial parts of the book will no doubt be when the author's take on the idea that parents should ignore tantrums. They dare to suggest that actually attempting to teach your child to process their feelings in the middle of the tantrum could be the best approach.<br /><br />Another excellent take-away with this book is the idea that parents need to move away from denying and dismissing their child's feelings.  Too often, I see parents dismiss their child's feelings because the feelings manifest in a way that the parent doesn't like or the parent doesn't know how to process his or her own feelings.<br /><br />This book does an excellent job of helping understand how to process emotions in a healthy way. If you child is experiencing fear, there are simple and real life takeaways that you can utilize to help them. If your child is angry with you because you set a boundary for them, there are easy to use ways that you can help your child express that in a healthy way!  This is one of the best aspects of this book.<br /><br />Lastly, this book gives a very cursory overview of mirror neurons. They are amazing and we all have them. If you have angry children, it might be because you are angry. Our brains are wired for \\"we\\" is an exact quote from the book.  As parents, we have to be integrated in order to raise integrated children. This book will find a lot of push back by the far right who believe a parents number one goal is to punish the evil out of their children and by those who find it doesn't match the way they parented.<br /><br />Regardless, buy it. You will not regret it. In fact, I suspect that you will be very happy that you did.rated children. This book will find a lot of push back by the far right who believe a parents number one goal is to punish the evil out of their children and by those who find it doesn't match the way they parented.

B004EPYZPS|5.0|The film is wonderful, one of Spielberg's finest efforts. The fact that it didn't get released in 1979 (when it was made) is downright insane. But, after 32 years it has been released. It is a sci-fi story of a small town rocked by the mysterious after-effects of a model train's derailment amidst a zombie invasion. Simply a great movie to behold.<br /><br />As for the format of Super 8, it certainly rivals VHS, and we aren't happy about it. Many have argued that VHS was not available in 1979, but that cannot be verified. MICHAELmATICIAN has released several Sound Units of/concerning VHS (and never Super 8) from 1979. MICHAELmATICIAN did not comment on Super 8 (the film) and neither has Spielberg. Perhaps in another 32 years someone will speak of this 1979 classic. (Hopefully not J.J. Abrams)<br /><br />2.342 (Jeremy Shingles)
B002NOAF9W|4.0|I remember hearing this album when it first came out and wasn't impressed with the sound quality...even for the day.  That is much improved now and the addition of BB King and Ike and Tina's opening set is a worthwhile addition.  The booklet is great, especially the photos.  Haven't watched the DVD yet, but all else is very good.  I likes it.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|Overall it's a fun app. It's relatively basic but considering it's free, it's worthwhile. It's moderately challenging on the most difficult setting.
0307959856|2.0|It is a truth universally acknowledged that a good writer attempting to emulate a great writer will invariably fail. Even if that good writer is considered to be the doyenne of her genre, readers seeking the focused wit and social observation of the original creator will close her book frustrated, especially if many reviewers extoll the sequel's virtues as entertainment and fitting homage.  A few brief passages sparkle with the reflected brilliance of Austen and most of them have been extensively quoted in reviews. If you are looking for the good lines, read those and forget the book. If however, you wish to be entertained for several hours, James, crafts an enjoyable if predictable mystery. Her style is far more descriptive of the environment of Pemberley and unlike Austen, she neglects to reveal character through dialogue and interaction, but relies solely on reflection. Most disappointingly, perhaps because of her own preferences for central male characters, James exerts virtually all of her energy on expanding on Mr. Darcy's character instead of allowing Elizabeth to remain front and center. Her motherly Elizabeth bears no resemblance to the intelligent and appealingly flawed center of Pride and Prejudice. It's as if James believes that marriage and motherhood are truly the end of the line for women and the assumption of these roles consign them forever banal characterizations as Madonnas (Elizabeth, Jane) or Medusas (Lady Catherine, Mrs. Bennet, Lydia).

B00667KMUO|4.0|The only reason I watched this film was because I'd watched the rest of the series and to be honest I wasn't really that impressed with any of them.  I'm a huge Harry Potter fan but that is mainly down to the books rather than the films.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II has changed my opinion about the films though and I really think it did the book justice.  The actors really blossomed in this film and the special effects were nothing short of fantastic... even Daniel Radcliffe could (almost) be classed as an actor.  The supporting characters were incredible and the film really finished off the series in a good light.<br /><br />I hope that my children will love Harry Potter as much as I have during these last few years.  I'm very sad that it has come to an end but hopefully the magic will live on for years to come... and you never know, Rowling may have something else up her sleeve.  I guiltily hope so!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|They may have to pry the original versions of these films out of George Lucas' cold dead fingers, but one day he will indeed shuffle off this mortal coil and I predict that we will have new video releases of the original films in whatever the cool new post-DVD technology happens to be.  Until then, I will have to be satisfied with the non-anamorphic DVD versions.
B005ER6STG|5.0|First off this was an awesome movie.  I am not for the stuff that was in it but what people need to realize is that this is Art, and theater, if you don't like it you don't have to watch it or talk bad about it.  This movie was well shot and the story was awesome.  I just wish we could have gotten the original version, instead of people getting there feelings hurt by the topics that are in the movie when stuff like this goes on in our world every day.  It was a great movie that I enjoyed watching, grant it might have been sick but it was probably one of the best shot films that I have seen.
B004KKX814|1.0|I bought this bey with my own money and i saw that it was from TAKARA TOMY. And about a week and a half later i saw it in my mailbox so i opened it and I saw that there was no takara tomy symbol. I checked the back and it didnt have anything on it really and it was printed in english when it said it was from japan. So then i opened it and i saw that it wasnt in original takara tomy packaging and that it came with a metal performance tip and a spin track and the F:S bottom and the bey had awkwar stickers and the cor wasnt half rubber, it was just all plastic so i realized i got a fake and it \\"said\\" clearly it was from takara tomy. I called my friend cas he got a fake too. And one of my other friends called and he got the real one! I woudnt recommend this if you care that you get a fake.

B003Y5H54W|2.0|Red Riding Hood, 2011 film<br /><br />The story begins in a mountainous area in winter. A young girl carries a bucket down the lane to fetch a pail of water, but is distracted by a young boy. \\"You do it.\\" Ten years pass. Peter's axe is taken away as a tease. A girl is promised to a rich man. What is the alternative? They hear the alarm - \\"the wolf\\"! Her sister Lucy is the victim. [Note the black clotted blood.] Those hay stacks seem to be too close together. We hear about an arranged marriage. Can they hire a man to kill the wolf? A poor woodcutter wants to marry Valerie, but her mother has other plans. The villages decide to hunt down and kill the werewolf. [They wear no hats in the cold and possess no spears or other weapons.] Valerie is given a red riding hood by her grandmother. The men search in the dark using torches. They split up. There is a scream in the dark. Later the men kill a wolf, but have a casualty. Valerie learns a secret about life in a small village.<br /><br />A coach with armed men arrive to kill the big bad wolf. The hunter tells about killing a werewolf; when dead it returns to its human form! The significance of a \\"blood moon\\" is explained to the villagers, and where the lair of the werewolf is! The villagers celebrate that night. [Is there a clue to the identity of the werewolf?] A conflict attracts attention. Later Valerie and Peter meet in private. The celebration is ended by the arrival of a big black wolf that attacks the villagers and gets away. \\"I warned you!\\" The wolf speaks to Valerie and asks her to go away with him. The morning light reveals more victims. \\"Look for the signs.\\" Everyone's homes will be searched, the innocent have nothing to fear. [No Fourth Amendment.] There is danger from a live victim of the werewolf. Peter wants to leave the village with Valerie. Valerie's mother was clawed by the werewolf. Henry breaks their engagement. A boy is found in hiding, what does he know? Can they make him talk? Can his sister save him? Valerie is accused of being a witch. Does she know a name?<br /><br />The people are told to go home. Can Valerie be saved? Will she be punished for her good looks? Can the witch escape? The big black wolf shows up again to kill and threaten the villagers. Another survivor of the attack is given his due. Later Valerie has a nightmare that involves a relative. The next morning the villagers go to hunt the werewolf. Valerie goes to visit her grandmother in the woods and finds a big surprise! \\"Then it all made sense.\\" The mystery is revealed at last. \\"It's a gift.\\" There is another surprise to end the story. \\"I'm so sorry.\\" A man is given a proper burial. \\"I'll wait for you.\\" The villagers still lived in fear. Valerie moved into the forest, she no longer feared a werewolf.<br /><br />This is one example of what could have been a good movie damaged by a poor story. It is funny to have white stuff on the ground while people are not dressed for cold weather (no breath showing). It seems like a 45 minute story padded out to a full-length movie. You can compare it to the much better 1941 \\"The Wolfman\\". Some years ago I read an article on werewolves. Two professors researched the old legends and found they followed an outbreak of rabies. A man bitten by a rabid wolf turns into a rabid creature who attacks other people. They must be destroyed by a bullet to prevent their blood from infecting their slayers.creature who attacks other people.

0307891372|5.0|I got Skyrim on the day of release, and thought with a game this huge, I had better order the guide too (the one from Oblivion was a huge help). If you are serious about getting the most from Skyrim, you need this guide. Now, I know that many people don't like using guides, because they see them as spoilers. I can understand that. Personally I use my guides as a reference; I will start a quest, and if I am having a PROBLEM, I will check the guide for help. I don't usually read the walkthrough first.  As far as my evaluation of the guide, I feel that it is invaluable. Even if you seldom, (or never), use the walkthrough section, which covers the main quest, all named side quests, faction quests, deadric quests, and so forth. It even covers, in a general way to orient you to them, the \\"miscellaneous tasks\\" and \\"favors\\" that you will be doing, the other parts of the guide are well worth having. First, the first 116 pages are referred to the \\"training\\" sections which cover character creation, maximizing the character type, improving your skills, how the menus/skill tree works, advice on crafting, exploring, followers, and so forth. Obviously much more useful, especially to the Bethesda beginner, than the 6 page or whatever guide that comes with the game.  But the most useful part, to me, starts on page 414. (Oh, did I mention this guide is more than SIX HUNDRED PAGES)? This atlas details every \\"hold\\" (area) of Skyrim, including their capital cities and towns, farms etc, services available, a guide to each capital city, including a map, history of the city, locations of shops, houses, castles, etc, and every \\"Primary Location\\" (dungeons, mines forts), and \\"Secondary Location\\" (bandit camps, etc), in the \\"hold.\\"  If you decide to explore a location it will show you an interior map and list what level you should be to venture in (i.e. strength of the enemies; TIP if you are level 2 and it says level 24, don't go in there yet, I found out the hard way), the type of locationit is, any other dangers (traps, etc), and the items/treasure you can find there, both when quests are running, and if you just decide to check it out. The introduction and the atlas make this book WELL WORTH THE PRICE. The walkthroughs, to me, are a bonus.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B0066W1AZK|4.0|as advertised, this is a very nice looking version. the game play is really good, and has an excellent control over the computer skill level. its also very responsive, although a few times it did not recover when awaking the game after my tablet went to sleep. the undo feature is really great for correcting stupid mistakes that can otherwise ruin a great game. I would give 5 stars except for the few bugs ive encountered (note that you have to play a lot to find them.)  one feature id like to see is a way to show the last computer move again. undo does no achieve this and its easy to miss what move the computer just made.  the computer plays well, and like most chess programs will destroy you in a hastily played end game.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This show is excellent.  I've been watching it since the first season and have have been buying each season to fill in the gaps when I've missed an episode.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I bought this at the same time as my Fire. It came one or two days later, and I am SOOOOOO glad I got it! The Fire was slippery to hold, and I have very small hands so it does not fit comfortably in one hand. (Which is fine, I didn't expect it to.) I can actually hold it, put it in my purse, and I now read at the table without having to worry about ruining my book. I only give it 4 stars because I worry the elastic strap will stretch from repeated uses. I use my Fire a LOT! Great product, definitely worth it!
0439023513|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books and intensely disliked this book.  The characters were not developed, and the storyline was not developed.  There were seemingly endless fighting and killing scenes, then jumping around without explanation or any semblance of flow to this mess.    The story did not wrap up the trilogy or explain anything.  Confusing, disappointing and depressing.

159562015X|5.0|First, this book is great for discovering and focusing on your strengths and not your weaknesses.   ONLY purchase directly from Amazon.com  A friend gave this to me as a gift that they purchased from Amazon, later we found out that she had actually bought it from a third party amazon seller.  When I went to take the assessment using the code in the book, it had already been opened and the code used. It turns out that many sellers on Amazon list this book as \\"New\\" when the code has already been used. She was able to get me another book so I could take the assessment, but it was a hassle for her.

There is something in the book for everyone; running barefoot, ultra-training, the loss of the Neanderthals and the rise of Homo Erectus, here are the highlights:  I have been injury free and known, for over 45 years of running, that running in overly padded and corrected shoes really didn't work for me - I always bought the cheaper ones without all of the frills [My wife still thinks it's because I was being Scotch-Irish about money!].  I even tested shoes for Reebok for 4 years, until I gave them a scathing piss-poor review on the DMX model about 1989.  All of that technology and every 7 - 10 mile run felt like a marathon until the cushioning bladder on the left shoe failed and voila the secret was revealed.  Padding sucked both the energy out of the run and the fun.  It seems that Nike knew this in the mid 80's yet continued to push those overly corrective shoes. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.......  In ultra-training, the key is energy efficiency.  I was lucky to have been trained by an ex-army ultra-runner and student at Indiana State University, Bill.  He was my training partner/coach during my junior year in high school and we trained on the ISU X-country course.  I hadn't run even 10 miles in training before I met Bill, but afterwards I was running 10 miles in 57 minutes.  It seems the key is in the foot strike - I know that because it's what I taught to the kids that I coached, even my grandchildren. Lean forward as if you are being pulled, be light on the foot-strike, and drop your foot and leg just under your body, without over striding, so your rate is higher but the stride-length is shorter.  It is just more energy efficient.  I guess I learned this lesson when I was training/coaching the diminutive Joe Wheatley, of Terre Haute South, in 1978.  He was only 5' 4\\" tall but with a short stride and high turnover he banished runners with greater strides and stamina.  The fall of the Neanderthal was concurrent with \\"global warming\\" at the end of the ice age.  They were primarily bulky, muscular, meat eaters and hunted in packs with poles and spears.  When the large animals started to disappear - so did they.  They could not adapt to \\"persistence hunting\\"; which is simply a term for running animals to death.  A task that Homo Erectus was adept at.  The piddly Homo Erectus man was more lithe than the Neanderthal.  Homo Erectus were vagabond hunters, moving [running with] women and children on the chase to run down a meal - the equivalent of \\"fast food\\" compared to the long hunt of the Neanderthals.  An Australian math major dropped out of college and spent four years living with a Kalahari tribe of Bushmen and discovered that persistence hunting still existed.  Using herding skills they would single out an antelope, or other herd animal, and keep it running for up to 10K - far more than the animals internal heat system would allow.  The end result was that the animals would literally fall over in exhaustion while the men, sweating, could afford to throw off the additional heat in the chase.  Way cool!  If you have ever experienced an \\"altered state\\" while running and, possibly howling at the moon, you know how this feels.  The writer, McDougall, weaves a spellbinding tale by interjecting personalities in the upcoming race-of-the-century when the gringos race the legendary Tarahumara runners of Chihuahua in Mexico's treacherous Copper Canyon - sounds like one helluva lot of fun to me!  All the elements of risk in one 50 mile run.  \\"Born To Run\\" exemplifies the reason I stopped reading years ago - I can't put down a good read.  Thanks to my daughter, Kathryn Adams, for the gift of this book. ;^ )
B000ICL3KG|4.0|What I would like to see is a followup to Gore's movie that presents a fictionalized account of the situation that exists in the U. S. in, say, 2050, and one family's attempt to cope with the changes that are occurring.  By 2100 the world's population is likely to be reduced to but a fraction of its current 7 billion, and between now and then our society will most assuredly disintegrate.  A movie that brought this out might wake enough people up to the disaster that faces us that the probability of more surviving would be increased at least somewhat.  I would like to believe that my grandchildren have a future, but have serious doubts about this.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|I use the sleeve with my kindle touch and it fits and looks great!  It seems pretty sturdy and fits nicely in my purse.
B005SV9W4Q|5.0|Lady Gaga's remix release of the Born This Way CD is awesomely addictive. The remixes aren't typical House mixes and that's what makes them so intriguing. The song rhythms change from song to song as quickly as Gaga's fashion styles. Certainly a great addition to your Gaga collection.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Have you seen all the stuff they are putting out for angry birds. They are taking it way to far. I mean zcandys, halloween costoums, stuffed animals eft. if you like angry birds then great game. It works fine on my kindle fire.
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|Except for the grandfather (played by Robert Forster), none of the actors in this movie catches the interest of the viewer.  Most disappointing is the rather wooden performance of Clooney:  if this is his best performance ever, . . . .  A good movie will engage the viewer emotionally, and except for  the last few minutes, this movie fails to do so.  Why this movie is a \\"critics choice\\" movie is beyond me--I certainly would not recommend it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Very well made, had my own concerns with a few of the negative reviews on the stand feature, right out of the box the stand works perfect!  Only time that you may have issues is if trying to use the stand on a soft non level surface, such as a pillow or pile of blankets.  Fits perfect with the Fire and very sleek design.  Highly recommend to all fire users!
B000VECAC6|5.0|Monty Python is very funny. Life of Brian is everything that you would expect from him. I rank this movie up with the Holy Grail.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|I bought this cover for my wife's Kindle Fire for Christmas. She was very happy with it.  It's very light weight, attractive (white), and provides the right protection for the device.  If I had a Kindle Fire, I would want this cover.
0307455351|5.0|I really had trouble getting into this book at first. I acutally had to restart reading it several times. But once I got past the first couple of chapters I found myself not wanting to do anything but read this book.
B003Y5H5C4|2.0|This seems like two different movies crammed into one. First you have the semi-serious dark comedy starring Eisenberg and Danny McBride, who both give fairly nuanced performances. If the route these two actors had taken had been followed by the writer and other cast members, this MIGHT have been a decent movie. Instead, we get the predictable goofy roommate, played by Ansari, who is a Chris Rock level of horrible actor, some extremely infantile violence-laced humor, and the most idioticly unrealistic ending I've seen in ages. This movie is not just stupid, but assumes that the audience is stupid as well.  This is based on a true story that is FAR more interesting than what we get. Of course, in real life, the pizza delivery guy died a horrible death, so a comedy might be a hard sell. What a horrible tribute to a real-life tragedy.
B0058VW36U|5.0|everyone who says this app is stupid really means it is to good for them so don't believe them and get the app!!!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use a lot of devices (work comp, laptop, home comp, smart phone, kindle fire, etc.) and Evernote is on every one of them coordinating all my important lists and ideas. It's. always the first app I install on any new device.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Good graphics, easy to play. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a challenge. It will keep you busy for awhile if you use all 4 suits.
B0063IH60K|4.0|i love solitaire and it is a good time killer. I was thinking about criticizing the hints, but i don't think people should even use those. i. love. solitare
B0058VW36U|5.0|get it...all I have to say is that is this game is worth more than just one dollar truthfully...buy it
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like that there are a wide range of reading plans, especially that &quot;The One Year Bible&quot; is one of them.  I have two complaints:__ 1) The reminders only seem to work if you have the Kindle open.  I have had reminders set up for 3 reading plans for a number of days and have received 1 reminder.  It came when I was using my Kindle.  I have never had a reminder waiting if the reminder time passed and the Kindle wasn't being used.  That's the whole reason why I set the reminder! 2) When you complete a reading plan for the day, a page comes up stating you've completed the required reading, and gives the option for making notes.  Sometimes the wrong plan completion page comes up (e.g. I'm reading the Trust plan, and when I finish the day's reading, I'm told I finished the readings for the Anger plan).  This is frustrating because it doesn't record what you've read accurately. If these two glitches are fixed, then this would be a 5-star application.  As it is, I would still recommend using this application, so long as you're not relying on reminders for reading.  If you need reminders, then I suggest you put this application in your favorites, so you can see the Bible picture and be reminded that way.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!  There are so many versions to pick from, devotionals to use, and you can attach your notes right to a verse you are reading.  Its all in one place!
B004NS710C|4.0|I think Denzel Washington is a great actor.  No matter what he does..IT'S GOOD.  This movie exemplifies exactly why he's one of the best.  The movie in general is exciting, full of suspense and special effects are outstanding.  I would recommend this movie VERY HIGHLY.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I am really getting frustrated with this kindle fire. It won't let me get any apps at all It says I have put a credit card number in but it's free. What the heck?
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Some film series are long lived because they are simply fun, and the Bond films are always enjoyable and creative. \\"Quantum\\" is no exception, and Daniel Craig is a great James Bond.  The fact that he has helped to breathe new life into the series pleases Bond fans everywhere.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover was exactly what I was hoping for. Perfectly functional and fits great.  Don't think it would provide much impact protection but not why I bought it.
B004EPYZXK|1.0|This was the most rediculous movie I have seen in a long time, and this is coming from a big fan of the \\"found footage\\" genre.  There was hardly any dialogue that you could actually understand, due to the \\"static\\" that was placed into the film. The footage was so shakey that it was very hard to identify what was going on. I will give the movie credit with the fact that the creatures were scary, when you actually got to see them. I really hate to knock on this movie so hard, but I was totally disappointed with it. The Paranormal Activity movies are some of my favorite \\"found footage\\" movies, so I guess I was looking for more scenes that I could actually tell what was going on. Anyway, I know most people will disagree with me, but I had to put in my two cents worth. If I was going to give you any advice, it would be to rent it other than buy it. That way if you are disappointed, you haven't really wasted too much money. If I had gone to the theatre to see this, I would have asked for my money back before I left.
0345495004|5.0|I gave the book as a Christmas gift to my son-in-law after a family weekend that included a tour of Falling Water and the other Frank Lloyd Wright house that was nearby.  He was fascinated with the structure at Falling Water.  My sister suggested I buy the book as a Christmas gift, which I did.
B00005UKE0|5.0|\\"All Things Must Pass\\" was an amazing body of work and stands the test of time beautifully. Some songs sound like they could've come off a Beatles album while others have George's own eclectic \\"style\\" that is just as good.<br /><br />Disc one's bonus section contains demos, an instrumental, and an underwhelming version of \\"My Sweet Lord\\".<br /><br />Disc two's bonus section is a big jam session with friends like Eric Clapton and others having a great time (it's all instrumental but very impressive).<br /><br />Not much more has to be said about this album, it's one that should be in your collection.
B000002HMH|5.0|You're either a Metallica fan or you are not.  I know there is the whole debate of old metallica vs new metallica and I honestly don't buy it.  If you've been playing the same songs in the same style for 20 years sometimes it's nice to have a change.  I still hear classic Metallica in most of these songs and you just have to be open to it.  It's definitely not as heavy but James Hetfield's voice is unmistakable!  Enjoy it!
B004DMIIUU|1.0|This film is in the graphic novel genre, like \\"300\\".  The visual quality is excellent, but it is otherwise near worthless as a reflection of the culture and history of Japan at this time.  The clothing is very european influenced (lace-up boots!) , and commoners display  attitudes that would get them summarily killed for insolence.  Architecture is on an  incredibly huge scale, rivaling the scope of the chinese imperial  forbidden city.  I have tried to park my brain and watch this movie a number of times and find its inaccuracies  too intrusive to finish it.  If your knowledge of japanese history and culture is marginal, this  movie will probably be quite enjoyable.  In summary, '300',' Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves' and Roy Rogers westerns  have greater historical and cultural accuracy.  Enjoy it for action entertainment, it does that quite well.
B000PMG16U|5.0|For all of you who say that the Prequels are a disappointment and George Lucas has gone too far, listen up! As we all know, George Lucas created ANH, ESB, and ROJ, a trilogy that is one of the best. Let me explain why I think the Prequels are just as good as the originals, maybe better.  The Phantom Menace -- This was the first Star Wars movie I ever saw. Not ANH like a large number of reviewers on the Complete Saga page. I am not a fanboy, I'm just a fan. When I first saw the VHS of PM, I loved it. I watched many times a day, like kids did in the 90s. Yes, I'm a kid from the 90s. I'm now 17, in fact. But that's besides the point. The point is I loved the PM even without watching the originals, something many people may not want to admit to say. Many people dislike PM because of Jar Jar Binks and the disappointment with the umiverse. First of all, Jar Jar Binks does not bother me. Just like the Ewoks in ROTJ, Jar Jar adds comic relief. That's all. That does not make the show unwatchable. It makes it better. This guy is just a wild character who just tags along for the ride. You can't help but smile at his actions. Next, the universe is different from ANH, yes, but it is not bad. Yes, the jedi are small amounts, and yes the Force is biological. But this is still the same star wars fans love. I recommend watching this if you saw the originals first, so you understand what the force is, who Yoda is, and who Anakin becomes. The rest is a good time. There are many scenes in this that I love. The podracing portion of the episode. LOVE IT! Anakin leaving his mother. I CRIED when I saw this at age 7. I would never want to leave my mother...sniff...anyway the best part is the climax. Invasion of Theed Palace, Droid Control Ship Raid, Battle of Naboo, and the Darth Maul fight...All at the same time! You have to love how all four action sequences are fitted together seemlessly. Another good part is that first shot of the galactic senate...I could go on. The point is, this movie makes you wonder...how can it become such a terrible place like in ANH? The answer is in the sequels.  Attack of the Clones -- I do agree that this is the worst of the series. But I shouldn't think that. Because the whole series is one story...I'll get there later. I rewatched this on Bluray yesterday and I liked it even more than before. SPOILER ALERT: Pretty much, an Assassination plot reveals that a clone army has been made for the republic under the order of master syfo-dyas. We then find out that Syfo-Dyas was killed and couldnt've made the order. We hear a brief mention of Tyrannis...but more on that later. Count Dooku, a idealist and the cause of the speration of star systems, apparently provided a droid army for the Trade federation, another sepretist head. Little do we know that Count Dooku and Tyrannis are THE SAME PERSON. I realized this yesterday (yeah, I know...). Sidious and Tyrannis provided both sides for a war that threatens to destroy the republic. I found that fasinating. The story is great, I agree. One major problem is Anakin's teenager actor, Hayden Christenson. I'm not hatin'. I think he provides a good view on Anakin. To Hayden, Anakin should be interpreted as a guy who is quiet, angry, and confused. I think he was a good choice for casting. (Boy who would disgree with that?) Leave your hatemail in the comment section below blah blah blah. Anyway, story and acting aside, the movie is great. The green screen effects are used too much, I gotta say. Though I do like digital yoda. Anyway, the movie is a frontrunner of the series, but the one that doesn't stand up for itself.  Revenge of the Sith -- The best of the prequels, though it should'nt be. One story blah blah blah later blah blah blah. Anyway. Hayden Christenson, brilliantly played as the darkly confused young man. He is! Really! The visuals are crisp and dark toned. The story is fantastic. The final 45 minutes are stunning. The burning scene...gives me chills...I love that fact that each battle in the prequels gets better and better. From duel-bladed Maul to duel-weilding Anakin to Yoda vs Dooku to four-saber Grevious to Yoda vs Emperor to finally Anakin vs Obi Wan. It is intense. This answers every question and brings the story full circle. Great!  Conclusion: Ok, first off PM is unique. While the OT and AOTC/ROTS are similar, PM is different. It is almost its own category. I love that it is different from the formula.   Anyway, the big climax of this review. All six movies, yes even the PT, are equal in every way. Why? Because it is just one whole story. According to George Lucas himself (in the 2004 edition of ROTS Commentary), he meant for the whole 12 hour story to be \\"The Story of Darth Vader\\" and it is! From his young beginnings and childlike antics to his teenage mind-poisoning to his redemption, Star Wars is a character study of Darth Vader. It depicts his whole life and how he affected others, the government, and his family. He is a sad figure who was used as a pawn for world domination. It is not some cheesy romp of two guys, a girl, and bunch of plot twists. Or at least, not just that. It is a different galaxy, but its issues are still human. It is beautiful, different, yet very human-run. Darth Vader is a fantastic character. And That's what Star Wars is about. Society in another world surrounding one man, good, and evil. That is why the Prequels are the same as the Originals. Because they tell One Story. And since there are no bad parts to a story (well, you may not like them, that does not make them bad), Star Wars is Perfect. Bravo George Lucas. Bravo.

076115678X|5.0|This book delivers everything you need to know about handling curly hair with care.  I appreciate the fact that the book is picture heavy where needed and not too wordy.  The accompanying DVD is great as well.  I would say this is a must have for curly girls, and anyone who will be caring for a head of curly hair.  If only my mother would have had this book when I was a kid!  LOL!
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I have read so many titles and yet I have never taken the time to write a review. But after reading this one I decided to change that.   This was a very interesting read. The techniques discussed are very practical and can be applied to any situation. As stated in another review, I too enjoyed technique number 5 - Ego suspension. It is in fact one of the hardest things to accomplish.   I also enjoyed technique number 8 - Connect with quid pro quo. Here the author aptly reminds us that human beings are genetically coded to reciprocate gifts.   Prior to reading this book I had not paid much attention to technique number 1 - establishing artificial time constraints. But as the author points out it can be such an effective technique.  I was introduced to technique number 2, the use of accommodating nonverbals while reading Christopher Hadnagy's - Social engineering: The Art of Human Hacking. As a side note that title is a MUST read. Ok so back to the business at hand. I was again reminded of the powerful effect of this technique. The examples used by the author were very effective at driving the point home. He takes you through the stages someone goes though when they are assessing a situation and how use of the technique can help put the individual at ease. Absolutely fascinating !!!  In the end, it is an awesome read. You will have a hard time putting this one down. I bought this over the holidays based on a tweet I saw. And I am glad I did. The \\"war stories\\" that accompany each technique will keep you wanting more.  Great job Robin.
1583334386|5.0|I expected this book to be more filled with scientific facts, but instead I found it delightfully balanced with sample cases of real people and guidance techniques that can help anyone with specific issues e.g. motivation, eating, exercise.  It is highly recommended for people who want to understand the biological reasons for our behavior.

0525423656|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. I liked Matched very much, and appreciated the characters and the plot. I liked the idea of \\"matching\\" and \\"sorting\\" -- it was an original idea for a dystopian future. I was hoping that we would get more characterization in Matched, because although I liked the characters I could never quite tell who they were.  Unfortunately, I don't believe Crossed helped me there. It was very much plot-based, which I thought was strange seeing as there wasn't much of one at all. It felt like the author was going in circles, unsure of what to do or what should happen next. I found it somewhat shocking that more than half of the book was spent on \\"finding Ky\\" and their moment of reuniting (which was sort of anticlimatic anyway). All I kept reading about was this mystery of the \\"rising\\", the \\"enemy\\" (which is never explained to any extent) and the \\"carving\\", which they wander around for a zillion chapters with no real purpose.   And then the lack of characterization. I found the characters to be very choppy and somewhat washed-out, never reaching their full potential. Again, it seems to me that this is based on the author's indecisiveness. One minute Ky and Cassia are closer than ever, and the next Indie is getting in the way? I found all of this very strange, and I felt that Ky's actions never quite matched up with what he was saying. First he says flat-out he is NOT going to the Rising because it goes against his beliefs, and thennnn...he's going.  It's just weird, and I still feel like I don't know who he is. To me, he seemed very selfish in this book, too, almost as if Cassia wasn't as important to him as before, which I think is obvious from their fight. I expected Ky to follow Cassia no matter what because he only believes in \\"her\\", but yet his beliefs on the rising get in the way? & Why is Cassia suddenly pro-rebellion? Why would she consider going to the rising without him if he was the reason for her retaliation in the first place?   And then the ending. Again, so wishy washy and anticlimatic! They go to the rising, aaaaand then they all get separated! What was the point?? I thought Cassia wanted to do all this to be with Ky, I thought that was the point of the book. But no, she's going to Central, with Xander, who is also rebelling? What?! I find it depressing that now she'll probably choose Xander, because of how out of character Cassia and Ky were here. Xander is ok, but he really annoys me, honestly, and I find him uninteresting and too \\"perfect\\".  Maybe I just didn't get it, I don't know, but I thought it was very weak and almost boring. I loved Matched so much more.
B006IND5M8|5.0|Recommended and fun film! It is a seat gripper and it held everyones attention. Steven S. Harrison Ford and other named actors? Win win.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I looked at covers for the Fire that I received for Christmas for a couple of days before buying this one. And I have to say, all the negativity about this one made me leary to buy it. Now that I have purchased it, let me just say this: ignore all of the naysayers that denounce this cover. It's great! Feels great, just like real leather, and still keeps the width of the device slim.   As for the tight elastic bands on the corners, yes, it is a little difficult to get the Fire into it at first, but the immediate positive that will hit you after you get the device in is that this thing isn't going anywhere. You won't have to worry about it falling out due to bad elasticity.   Addressing the \\"band covers the speakers\\" comments, they do cover the speakers a little on the edges, but if anything, it helps to amplify the sound a little more.   Finally, the big \\"doesn't close all the way\\" controversy. After you close the cover over the Fire the first time, you'll immediately see that the \\"spine\\" of the book is rather rounded. Just run your fingers along the spine, pressing in slightly, and in no time, the cover will sit completely over the front of the Fire. You may have to do it a few times, but over time, as the leather loosens, the problem won't persist.   After all the negativity about this product, I felt the need to write this review to you perspective buyers and let you know that your money will be well spent on this beautiful product to cover your Kindle! I will definitely recommend this to others seeking a cover for their Kindles or other eReaders/Tablets.

B005UKJX4E|1.0|I guess there was a story in this movie. It seems like the director & screenwriter were trying to do a Kubrik-esque kind of movie, and in my opinion, failed miserably. If your kind of movie is one with a lot of nice visuals of just about everything under the sun with classical music playing in the background, this movie is for you. If you prefer movies with a plot and character development, you might want to take a pass on this one.

0060873027|1.0|It starts out as a great Michael Crichton masterpiece to be...but it goes down hill after a few chapters into the book. The writer is more concerned with relating and explaining scientific details than with actually telling a good story. The more I read, the more frustrating it became. After a few disappointing incidents that I won't reveal, but devastated the whole story in my opinion, I gave up and returned it to the library. Nothing could have made it better from that point on - utterly ridiculous. Oh, how I miss Michael Crichton!

B003D0ZNM4|5.0|Nothing is as easy and enjoyable as listening to the best music to feel good.  And to me Arvo Part is the most enjoyable music there is.  First it's not like some classical music where you have to sit through it and it can kind of ware on you after a little while (I'm not knocking classical music I'm just saying).  Arvo Part's music is so sublime, so peaceful, it never gets old.  And unlike alot of 'Best Of' albums this one is pretty close to it.  The only song it's missing which is my favorite is 'Da Pacem Domine.'  If you buy this cd but still want more Arvo afterwards buy 'Da Pacem Domine.'  Only one song you'll get twice 'Magnificant.'  If you do buy this 'Best Of' 2 cd set your kind of stuck if you want all his works unless like I said you buy the 'Da Pacem Domine' album.  And that cd with these cds is a pretty hefty collection of Arvo Part to start out with.<br />David R. Hawkins talked about in his book 'Power Vs. Force, how with Kinisiology humans can now measure the conciousness of anything inlcuding music for example.  Some people have taken his muscle testing to work and measured various music to calibrate it's conciousness on a scale from 1 to 1000.  Think of 1 as death and 1000 as Jesus. The higher the more enlightening.  Arvo Part tested the highest.  Someone had a good video posted on youtube called the 'musical levels of conciousness,' showing Arvo Part's high calibration but I think they took it down.  I believe listening to Arvo Part will improve peoples lives, it's more than just music.  Whenever I play Arvo Part in my home with my family and the volume accidentaly goes to high in a certain part of the song or whatever, no one ever gets mad like other music and says \\"it's too loud.\\"  I love the study done in England/London that showed when classical music was played at subway stations and street corners crime dropped by half that month, ,murders were nonexistent and on and on and on.  I can only imagine what would happen if they played Arvo Part's music all across the world in the streets, in restaraunts, jails, churches, and homes.  What would happen if people traded rap, rock, and death metal for someone like Arvo Part?  There is a reason it's called death metal.  This is more than just music.  This cd and the work Arvo Part has spent his life making goes beyond our entertainment.  Music is therapy.  I have been searching for the most enlightening music there is and I know of no one better at the moment than Arvo Part.  By the way having his music on cd sounds way better than listening to it on your computer from youtube. I should of manned up and bought the cds along time ago.music all across the world in the streets, in restaraunts, jails, churches, and homes.

B000050XEI|5.0|There is a reason that Enya is the best selling female artist of Ireland, her lush sound and touching melodies have taken the world by storm in the last 25 years. \\"A day without rain\\" is no exception, as it is Enya's best selling album to date having sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Although it seems a bit silly to wait 5 years to release an album that lasts only 34 minutes, 25 seconds (37 minutes, 35 seconds if you buy the version with the track \\"The First Of Autumn\\"). However, upon closer look at the beautiful production, you'd know that it takes time to record multiple voice layers along with one person doing many instruments. In addition to the amount of time she needs to produce each track, she really does not need to release albums more frequently than she does because each one is its own entity and sells over generations (her second album \\"Watermark\\" is still selling). Ultimately, length doesn't matter with this collection, because \\"A Day Without Rain\\" holds Enya's most insubstantial and heavenly songs to date, which include her signature 9/11 soundtracking song \\"Only Time\\". The title of the album says it all, instead of including many dark sounds and digging into the depths of the human mind, Enya keeps the mood light as she waltez you through this set which also includes the flower dance \\"Flora's Secret\\" and her graceful, but lyrically embarrassing, tune entitled \\"One by One\\". She finishes the album with \\"Lazy Days\\", which is really only one sound effect \\"da\\" repeated over and over, but yet is catchy enough to make you sit and listen until the album's end. From start to finish, it's easily understood that this is Enya's most warm, fun, and bright album to date, as well as her most versatile. In the car or in the bathtub, you can enjoy having a day without rain and filled with sunshine anywhere.

B005JLN9ZI|3.0|When I first listened to the entire cd, it had maybe 5 good songs and the rest sucked. I sat there waiting for the cd to be over. I was shocked that there could be 17 songs that have maybe 9 songs that seem to blend into each other. They sound- the same. Anyway, i Loved LOVED his first cd, he's sensitive x3 and i'm not really hot on rap so he was just the right amount of r&b & rap. so, i got this one to show support b/c i didn't exactly get his first cd legally. It's just, his style of rap changed in this one. He started sounding like two other rappers i've heard b4. It was weird and didn't work. I regret buying it to an extent but, after listening to it over 3 times, it's not as bad. the last 8 songs still suck, but, listening to the lyrics... helps. Cause if you just hear the beat and his voice, it's BORING, but his words have meaning.. half the time.  SO, my advice, buy the first cd and don't waste your time on this one, not until you've listened to it on myspace or something. Hear the lyrics, find meaning in em, then add them to the beats, and if it's not your taste then don't waste your money.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|This is nice. I own Xbox and PS3, and I can't stand the PS3 controllers.  This controller is nice, grips well, looks sharp and performs.  I would say that I had a bit of a learning curve, getting used to the buttons, especially the trigger buttons (Seems I had to pull them in a little further/harder), but all in all I am happy with this and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an Xbox style controller to use with a PS3 system.  4 out of 5 stars.

B000002KEV|5.0|I love this album !    What a great album by one of the most underated bands of the 70s. Its great to hear so many accomplished musicians give Deep Purple their due today! What I love about this live album is that it captures Deep Purple just exactly the way that I would want to see and hear them. Remember that this was the period of time when it wasnt unusual for bands such as Zep, Humble Pie, and especially Deep Purple to go into these amazing long jam sessions on the stage sometimes in the case of Zep weaving in and out of one song into another.     For one reviewer who said and Im paraphasing that sometimes more is just too much, meaning that the songs are just too long for him Im sorry that he didnt catch all of the change ups and differences. When a band can go on stage and jam out Child in Time in the way Deep Purple did trading off leads from John Lords hammond to Richie Blackmore simply burning it up on guitar, now thats something else. And Ian Gillian's vocals oh my lord....    This was a very special period of time for the evolution of rock n roll just look at the bands of this period and what they were doing. Amazing ! Deep Purples Made in Japan is in my opinion one of the definitive albums of the period, it show cases a powerfull band who could take the stage and give you a couple of seemingly hours of jaming music each member feeding off of each other and pulling it off perfectly. As a friend of mine put it \\" I dont mind at all hearing that hammond organ because I know when John Lord pulls out Blackmore is about to follow up and kill it ! \\" And if you think that its easy performing in this way just grab a instrument and give it a try and stay in rythm with what everyone else is doing at the same time\\"     The problem with us today is that we want imeadiate gratifacation give me 3 minutes of a great rocker and next please! Then we think oh that was good too bad it wasnt longer. Well thanks Purple for giving us something that we can sit and enjoy and showing musicians today how to get it done.

0061120073|5.0|When A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was originally published in 1943, it was a huge success, and Betty Smith's book became an instant classic. It is about several years in the life of the Nolan family in the early 20th century and it is mostly about the coming-of-age of the main character, Francie Nolan. It is that rare novel that can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults.  This book very definitely has its own style, I think partly because it was written as a memoir and changed into a novel. Smith obviously poured her heart into this book. Her other novels are charming, but they don't have the depth of this book. Because Smith could fictionalize apparently real people, she could flesh out the characters until they seem like real people, not characters in a novel. Sometimes even minor characters are given thoughts and feelings, as how they relate to the main characters in the book.  A strong point of the novel is its sense of place. Smith even describes in detail the neighborhood. the neighbors and everyday life until you feel are actually in the Brooklyn of 100 years ago. The novel opens by describing Brooklyn in 1912:  \\"Serene was a word you could put to Brooklyn, New York. Especially in the summer of 1912. Somber, as a word, was better. But it did not apply to Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Prairie was lovely and Shenandoah had a beautiful sound, but you couldn't fit those words into Brooklyn. Serene was the only word for it; especially on a Saturday afternoon in the summer.\\"  The women are the stronger people in the book. Many of the male characters are weak-willed, while the women persevere. Francie Nolan, the main character, is the daughter of Johnny and Katie Nolan and the sister of Neeley. Francie is a fully-realized character. Francie is a strong person, who you know will do well in life.  Katie, the mother, is very hard-working. She cleans apartment buildings for a living. She is scrubbing floors when she is an advanced state of pregnancy. Katie refuses anything thatsmacks of \\"charity.\\" One wonders what she would think of Section 8, food stamps, free school lunches, and WIC. Sometimes there is no food in the house, and the children go hungry.  Johnny Nolan, the father, is a singing waiter, but has no steady job. He mostly works at one-shot jobs like weddings and parties. Johnny is an alcoholic. There was little understanding or treatment of alcoholism when Smith wrote the book. We now know that alcoholism is a disease, with both powerful psychological as well as physical components. So even though Johnny is lovable, and really loves his children, he is perceived as weak and a loser. Johnny comes from a long line of alcoholics; perhaps his problems were at least partially due to a genetic disposition toward the disease.  Francie senses that her mother loves Neeley more, but she eventually comes to peace with it. This does not mean that her mother doesn't love her, of course she does. It is partly because Neeley is reminiscent of the father and Katie does not want him to turn out the same way. Francie is like her mother in that she is strong and smart, but she has also inherited her father's creative ability and his dreaminess. One of the main differences between Francie and her father is that Francie takes action, and Katie admires that. Francie works hard at school and at her various jobs, and in improving upon her hardscrabble beginnings.  The novel does have flaws. Some of the psychoanalyzing and character analysis is quite dated. Women are thwarted by \\"starved love instincts.\\" However, I find the book to be mostly very strong, especially about the characterization of Francie. She is a completely realized character. You feel as if you know her. The book takes her from an eleven-year-old child to a young woman about to leave Brooklyn and start new adventures. Even though she is going far away, she will never really leave Brooklyn behind:  \\"She might get rid of her Brooklyn accent that way. But Francie didn't want to get rid of it any more than she wanted to get rid of her name. It meant that she belonged some place. She was a Brooklyn girl with a Brooklyn name and a Brooklyn accent. She didn't want to change into a bit of this and a bit of that.\\"  You just wish that there had been a sequel.
0307949486|3.0|I read all these books and liked them.  I've seen the Swedish films, and just saw the new movie.  I've read some four star reviews and agreed with them, and read some one star reviews and agreed with them too, so at least I can say these books have something for everyone!  The action was good, the bad guys get theirs, and Lisbeth makes a fascinating study.  The best part of the trilogy, IMO, was her story, and how she eventually is defended and exonerated.  That alone would have made a fascinating book.  The author was, at the least, ambitious. He's got about four books ongoing in three volumes--Salander's story, Blomqvist's story, a treatise on violence against women, and an ongoing lesson on various aspects of journalism.<br /><br />One thing I've never been able to understand.....Vanger has a good mind, Blomquist and Salander are brilliant in their ways, and no one thought to wonder if the pressed flowers weren't being sent yearly as a message to Vanger that his niece was ok?  Even if the author had had Vanger pooh-pooh the idea, at least someone should have thrown it out there that it was meant to be a reassuring gesture to Henrik rather than years of emotional torture. It's the first thing I thought of when I read the book,  \\"Oooh, I'll bet Harriet's still alive and she's sending these as a message to her uncle not to worry about her.\\"  You'd think one of those geniuses would have thought that up if it occurred to me, and I'm sure, to other readers as well.
0375507256|5.0|My word for this book is \\"magnificent.\\" David Mitchell creates characters that are completely consistent and convincing. He carries us, his readers, through  worlds that are connected by circumstance but separated by centuries. For each of these worlds he assumes a new persona and new voice. Sometimes the characters are hugely annoying, which is intentional, but most of the time they are completely engaging. I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone, but if you're ready for a mental challenge with myriad twists and turns, read this book. It's wonderful.

0375758992|5.0|Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood by Alexandra Fuller, is the author's account of growing up in the countries of Rhodesia , Malawi and Zambia. Fuller's family was originally from England, where Alexandra was born. Her family moved to Africa during a time of great unrest. Rhodesia was still white-ruled, but at the tail-end of British colonialism. The parents like to live in isolated areas, far away from towns and cities.  However, Fuller's parents were not rich, titled landowners, but rather poor farmers barely eking out an existence. Of course, they still had black servants. Even if Rhodesia didn't have an official \\"apartheid\\" which in Afrikaans means \\"apartness\\", everything is separate. The different races go to different schools, stores, and hospitals.  Alexandra and her sister Vanessa are shaped by the racist attitudes of their parents and the white society around them. After all, why would she question it? That is all she knows. Even though she grows up in the 1970's and 1980's, there is no television in her house, the only radio broadcasts seem to be from the BBC, and most of the people she meets on a daily basis are her family and the black servants.  Those blacks fighting for independence are considered \\"terrorists\\". So life is tough for everyone:  \\"Vanessa and I, like all the kids over the age of five in our valley, have to learn how to load an FN rifle magazine, strip and clean all the guns in the house, and ultimately, shoot-to-kill.\\"  Fuller also loves Africa. The book is filled with rich imagery and poetic language:  \\"What I can't know about Africa as a child (because I have no memory of any other place) is her smell; hot sweet, smoky, salty, sharp-soft. It is like black tea, cut tobacco, fresh fire, old sweat, young grass.\\"  This story is fascinating, mostly taking place during the time of the Rhodesia Civil War, when blacks decided that they wanted their land back and to rule, which is what eventually happened (Rhodesia is now called Zimbabwe). Eventually, their land is taken away from the family and eventually the Fullers move first to Malawi, and then to Zambia.  The book is not heavily political, however, as it mostly concerns what happened within the Fuller family, and that story is almost unbearably tragic at times. Out of five children born to the family, only two survive. Alexandra blames herself for the death of her sister, and I strongly suspect that she still is bearing that terrible burden today:  \\"No one ever came right out and said in the broad light of day that I was responsible for Olivia's death and that Olivia's death made Mum go from being a fun drunk to a crazy, sad drunk and so I am also responsible for Mum's madness. No one ever came right out and said it in words and with pointing fingers. They didn't have to.\\"  Fuller also makes no apologies for or commentary on the racist attitudes of the white Rhodesians, including those of her own family. Is that a weakness of the book? Perhaps, or else she just feels that it is unnecessary to do so. She prefers to write about it as she saw it at the time when she was a child. After all, it does not show these people in a very flattering light. She doesn't spare herself, either.  However, I still highly recommend this book. It is very funny but also achingly sad at times. You will be a richer person for having read it.

B005SJIP2S|2.0|I remember back in late 2007 or early 2008 when I figured out Yes was reuniting for their 40th anniversary. I was stunned and probably more excited for a tour than I had ever been. Yes was (and still is) my favorite group, so immediately bought tickets to the show scheduled to be played at the Pier 6 Pavilion in Baltimore (the nearest place to my location where they were playing). I was so pumped and ready to go.  But then, Jon Anderson got sick and nearly died. Doctors advised him to stay on bed rest for 6-12 months, thus sidelining the summer 2008 40th anniversary tour. Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Alan White, and Oliver Wakeman, the remaining band members, were unwilling to wait and hit the Internet (namely YouTube) and found Canadian singer Benoit David, of the Yes cover band Close to the Edge and of Montreal progressive rock group Mystery. By October 2008, the tour was back on. Yes was carrying on without Jon Anderson. It was hard to believe, and many believed it was temporary, but it was still happening.  Well, here we are in late December 2011, about to enter 2012, and Benoit David is still the frontman of Yes. Oliver Wakeman departed earlier in the year, replaced by former Yes-man Geoff Downes (of the 'Drama' era lineup from 1980-1981). 2011 has been quite a busy year for the reformed Yes, including the release of this live album, 'In the Present: Live from Lyon.' The show was recorded back in 2009, early on in the reunion.  When evaluating this record fairly, one must open their mind completely. I did. This is not the same band that it was with Jon Anderson or any other keyboardist (including Kaye and Moraz) that had participated in prior lineups. This was the new Yes with three familiar faces. I bought this record at a local record store, took it home, and listened to it. To do this review the right way, I figure I need to break it down into two areas: the good and the bad.  THE GOOD  - This is a great setlist. 'Astral Traveller' was recorded in 1970 before Steve Howe joined the group. That means, from the current \\"In the Present\\" lineup, only Chris Squire was a member of Yes when this track was recorded. 'Onward,' from the 1978 'Tormato' record was also a surprise here. This track was included on the 1996 live album 'Keys to Ascension 1,' and it seems to be the only track from this record that the group acknowledges.   - The sound quality is actually fairly decent. Frontiers Records, while it is owned by EMI, is not a major label yet, and so it is not fair to expect the same level of quality from them as it would be from Atlantic Records, Yes' home from 1968-1990 or Arista Records, Yes' home from 1991-1992. The band can be heard quite clearly and the sound is not at all compressed, which is rare for a live album these days. It's not incredible, but the sound here is actually better than the sound on 'Fly from Here,' the 2011 studio album also released on Frontiers and produced by the legendary Trevor Horn (also a vocalist in Yes during the 'Drama' era, but that's another review).  - The Roger Dean artwork is amazing. One has to wonder though, if Yes were truly trying to move forward \\"in the present\\" why they keep revisiting the past and using Roger Dean's artwork. Ah well, no objections that they did. It looks great. Roger Dean paintings have always seemed to have enhanced Yes albums for some reason.   - 'Corkscrew' is a great Steve Howe solo. It's always great to listen to Howe show his skills on the acoustic guitar.  THE BAD  - Two words: Benoit David. On several tracks (namely 'Owner of a Lonely Heart' and 'Roundabout'), David is desperate to sound like Jon Anderson. And on others ('Machine Messiah') he tries to sound like Trevor Horn. Like I stated in my 'Fly from Here' review, Benoit is a fine singer, but he has very little or no personality of his own. He is always trying to imitate Anderson or Horn, instead of providing original interpretations. It has always bothered me when bands try to replace their vocalistswith a soundalike; that's why the 'Drama' lineup of Yes worked and Queen + Paul Rodgers worked. Trevor Horn didn't try to sound like Jon Anderson, and Paul Rodgers didn't try to sound like Freddie Mercury. Benoit David tries to sound exactly like Trevor Horn and Jon Anderson. This gets quite irritating after the second or third track.  - There is nothing on this record that is particularly memorable. The playing is average to mediocre, something quite shocking for Yes, and there is nothing here that one would remember really without repeated listenings. It is cool seeing 'Machine Messiah' on a live album, but the version here is simply not up to par. It is unfortunately the case for most of these songs.  - While there aren't any noticeable notes or passages played wrong, judging from how the band sounds here, it certainly sounds as though they could use a bit more rehearsing. The songs just sort of chug along without much energy or life. That is a crucial part of any good live album, and 'In the Present' just lacks it. The crowd energy is not great at all. Also noticeable is that the songs are played considerably slower. This is probably to be expected, as Yes certainly aren't spring chickens anymore, but I certainly have to think that Yes is capable of picking up the pace a little more than what you hear on this record.  I saw Yes at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia in June 2010. Peter Frampton was the opening act at the show. I did get to meet Yes backstage (which was an honor), but I have to say, the band sounded better while I was there than they did in actuality. I saw clips of my show on YouTube, and I was amazed at how sluggish the show really did sound. Frampton absolutely blew them away that night. Whereas Frampton's show was full of energy and sounded just incredible, Yes just seemed to be going through the motions.  It pains me to write this. It really does. I love Yes, and I always will. But when I look back on Yes, odds are, I will ignore the \\"In thePresent\\" era of Yes, which started in 2008 and is still going on today. Jon Anderson & Rick Wakeman, two former members of Yes, are touring together and have a live album due out early next month. My advice to the fan who has not bought this record yet but is seriously considering it: skip this and wait for that one. In hindsight, I wish I had.  While it's not fair to expect another 'Yessongs,' or even another 'Keys to Ascension,' it is fair to say that this performance is not what it could have been. If this is the most inspired performance from the last three years that Yes has in their vaults, than that is a bit concerning to me. I know this group can do better than what has been presented to us here.   Marginally better than 'Fly from Here,' but that isn't saying very much unfortunately. Two-and-a-half stars is more than fair for this live album.

B00095NX9G|5.0|Rachel Brice's style is one that I try to emulate - slow, slinky, and serpentine. I'm so glad that she released a DVD set that teaches her own personal style so well.<br /><br />This DVD comes with a lot of yoga, as usual for Rachel Brice. If you're not interested in yoga at all, this dvd is not for you. It includes a 33-minute yoga work out, a yoga work out for backbends (yes, backbends!), and some finishing yoga work-outs. I've been trying to improve my posture, flexibility, and stamina in belly-dance, and doing the yoga work-outs before my belly-dance practice has been proving to be very useful for me. I pop in one of these DVDs every day to do one of the yoga work outs, then I do a few of the drills or work on one of the choreography sections, then I do a finishing yoga work out. It takes a lot of time if you're not used to practicing at least an hour every day, but it's been so worth it.<br /><br />Even though I've been dancing for a few years I still had difficulty keeping up with a few parts. In some parts it's very easy to follow Rachel Brice and she explains things very well, then every now and then she'll pop out with one of her crazy Rachel Brice moves with not enough explanation, and you're not sure how to keep up. But overall it was very easy to follow and well explained - still working on that shimmy drill, though!<br /><br />I'm also very grateful she included yoga for backbends as well as explanations and safety information (go to the mini-class section before you try the backbends, and do the yoga!)  I know some people just want to try and emulate Rachel Brice's crazy wonderful backbends, but it does take a LOT of practice. The yoga and explanations has helped me improve my backbend, though.<br /><br />I also appreciate the occasional small moments of humor Rachel Brice includes in the DVD. Her last dvds seemed a little more serious, which I don't mind, but the random bits of humor are appreciated.<br /><br />Overall, my favorite DVD ever!

1576875776|1.0|Just received the book which was unavailable for a while.  Assume it is the newest printing.  Many pages are blank in the book, mostly between other photographs, and it appears to be a printing error.  emailed the publisher, and they say it is intentional.  So, a total of 14 pages of this book are blank by design. Also the photos are, by and large, the same ones you can view on the Maloof website.

B000AGTPUA|5.0|The Polar Express taps into our affirmation that Christmas is believing, that believing is good, that being good will always be rewarded, and that we must keep faith with our beliefs and our dreams or they will disappear into the lost innocence of adulthood.<br /><br />Hungering for a classic of some kind that would remind me of the larger-than-life Christmas stories of my childhood, I started to watch this even though I had passed it by with channel surfing warp speed dozens of times before. It wasn't long before I realized I might be watching a classic I had been yearning for.<br /><br />It is Christmas Eve and a little boy is fighting sleep with a rising skepticism in the belief of Santa Claus. A check of his atlas by flashlight confirms that the North Pole is an uninhabitable and barren place, just before he jumps back into bed one blanket ahead of his parents opening his door.  He hears his father whisper to his mother about the end of the magic, which he thinks has something to do with the belief in Santa. Later, and still awake, the sound of a train's whistle and its cars with yellow light blazing from passenger car windows, appear on the snow in front of his house. In robe, pajamas and slippers, he heads out to explore when a conductor asks if he's going to get on board. His adventure to the North Pole, on the Polar Express begins.<br /><br />He meets a sweet-looking, wholesome girl who is as trusting as he is doubtful, a nerd who hides his doubts behind glasses and know-it-all obnoxiousness, a later, younger arrival who only seems to trust his own solitude, and a hobo who sounds cynical and kindly at the same time.<br /><br />The animation was so good that the children almost seemed real. Tom Hanks lent his voice to at least three characters I could identify, and the music, especially the song \\"Believe\\" was absolutely enchanting. The story is how each of us react to our doubts and fears that some things are true or that some are not, that the strongest things to believe in are the things we cannot see or hear. In the end, we find out if our hero, the skeptic can still hear the bells when they could no longer be heard by others.<br /><br />Here's hoping you can hear the bells in your Christmas--and still believe.we cannot see or hear. In the end, we find out if our hero, the skeptic can still hear the bells when they could no longer be heard by others.    Here's hoping you can hear the bells in your Christmas--and still believe.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|Bittersweet angst-ridden kid stuff well-done!<br />Sweetly done by Richard Ayoade, who played an entertaining role in The Mighty Boosh(correct?). I can easily imagine Ayoade speaking the lines in many instances.<br />Music selection is okay. Maybe it fits the film best. Break down though and use some music that is less, hmmm, eclectic or pretentious(?). Whatever.<br />Nice actors chosen for the roles. Sally Hawkins is always attractive and the dad was excellent.<br />Profanity, sexuality, violence, political tilt are all acceptable and nonexistent.<br />Nothing offensive except a strange message at the film start about America not invading England and rubbish. Is this supposed to reflect a child's attempt at political awareness and making his voice heard? A message as delivered from Oliver, I suppose, which might fit the film context. (Bashing America is old hat nonsense)<br />I was interested and entertained throughout.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Love the game!  Doesn't take hours to play.  Just wish you could play with more than 4 people. Good family fun.  Might look into expansion pack.
B000002KAT|5.0|If this isn't tops on your Best Albums of All Time List you are either a pretentious jerk or you think that justin bieber has artistic merit. Serioulsy 'Astral Weeks' was the begining of The Album as an integrated piece of art not a collection of singles. Buy a good bottle of wine and turn off the lights and listen to this on your high fidelity system or Studio Monitor Headphones (don't you dare compress it to nothingness on an mp3) and tell me there is a better musical journey available.<br /><br />Note: This review was written by someone who realy realy likes Van Morrison

Not enjoying my Fire / Amazon experience thus far, but in this case I am happy. I'd suggest showing support and buying the Pro version but of course it isn't available in the Amazon store. Figured it was worth mentioning that this is your best bet for a reader, hands down.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|I recently bought this for my Pride & Prejudice obsessed daughter as a Christmas present. She loves it, the picture quality is purely stunning. She has watched it about 3-4 times already, the only downside of owning it :). She previously had the movie recorded on our DVR and has watched both the recording and the Blue-Ray so many times that she has practically memorized the entire movie. I don't mind it as much as the rest of my family, it has such pretty scenery.

Why i could see it on TV for Free and not Buy.  what internet are for?

B006LNOOW0|5.0|To start with I should say that I found the story of the first part more enjoyable than I did the second. So this review is more about the quality of the 3D. I purchased this collection of 3D/2D/DVD and digital video from Best Buy for $35. The quality of 3D is just simply SUPERB. In each and every scene there are clearly very high quality 3D effects, and in a few scenes, some very nice OOS effects. I saw this first in 2D, and the quality of color, black levels, clarity were all amazing, but it is in 3D it is \\"pure awesomeness\\" to quote Po (and my kids!)! If you have a full 3D setup it is total fun, and a must have for your collection.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|great graphics and undo button. I do wish it had hints or explanations, but still excellent. so different than non fire kindle chess!
B003Y5H4YI|5.0|This movie has an original and amazing ending, but the entire presentation was captivating.  I think it is important for history to acknowledge what happened during that time and make young people aware so that generation after generation never forgets what was done to the Jews by Hitler's Nazi monsters.
B003Y5H5C4|5.0|Best Movie ever! You must watch this! Though not as great as Zombieland. All I can say is, everyone must watch this movie! Makes me wish I delivered pizzas.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I Love This Game! I Mostly Win, But Sometimes It Gets Hard.. Its So Fun On My Kindle Fire! I Like How You Can Change Thee Backs Of The Card And The Background!
0385535139|5.0|i love his earlier works specially, a time to kill, the client and the street lawyer. but im not such a big fan of the brethren, it is good, but it did not surpass his previous works, not even equaled them..!  but i think he has returned on this novel.  nothing great but at least better then his lesserly done works like the brethren.
B004EBZX6W|2.0|It was working great until I received the update, then it stopped working. Even after uninstall/reinstall it still will not work now. I don't know what the update was supposed to do, but why mess up a good thing anyway? Lastly, this happened on a Kindle Fire.
B005ZUR724|2.0|I love this game but for some reason I cant find the update so I cant log in. Please fix and I will rate higher
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|she has truly evolved in this album, very nice and nicely done. sweet and sexy.. upbeat and personal, i really love what she did on this album.
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|Let me say this is for my amazon kindle fire..First time i saw a trailer for this game I was blown away, the graphics were amazing and the colors just \\"POP\\" out so vibrantly.I wasn't so sure on pulling the trigger on this purchase being that it was somewhat expensive for an android game, i came back periodically until the promised day came.The price came down to 1.99 i clicked it/downloaded it and installed it within seconds.At first it starts off slow and after that it picks up rapidly, first you have a rescue a fellow comrade then your harvesting resources from the aliens and before you know it your running your own squadron, with tanks and cannons and what have you. I really enjoy the controls of the game, you can change the route your squad takes and your responsible with healing your team and providing distractions along with protection. Your team will be doing work, destroying your enemies.<br />After reading the 6 stage my game started acting funny, after the first 10 seconds of the stage the game would just freeze or the screen would go black. I will consider re-installing the app and running the app again.But without that minor glitch this is a pretty solid app game for any tablet!<br /><br />EDIT 2.3.2012<br />Glitch has been fixed and game is perfectly playable.<br /><br />5 stars out of 5.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Great low tech toys to keep \\"kids\\" of all ages busy. This toy has been played with by all ages from 10-50 and enjoyed by all.

B00650SSWG|5.0|I downloaded this movie to my kindle fire and loved watching every minute of it. It was relatable and hysterically funny. I definitely recommend you watch it if you are into comedies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is very entertaining.  I didn't know how to play it, and now I think. I do.  And the best part is that I don't have to ask anyone to teach me anymore
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|This version of angry birds is fun but slow. My Kindle started to slow up and kind of sputter. I uninstalled it after like five minutes. Please just don't get this app unless you want to slow up your device and waste time.

B004INNRFK|5.0|This is an excellent cd/dvd although I don't like it as much as Hit Man, it is still very good.  You don't expect anything less from David Foster.  Its a wonderful gift for anyone of any age.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am so addicted to this game! I have never played it until I got my kindle fire and now I cant stop!!
B005KMX866|5.0|As a long time Chris Isaak fan I expected this to be an excellent album. It went WAY beyond expectations! If you like real rock and roll music that is honest and crisp buy this and prepare to have an auditory feast. Mr. Isaak wrote some of the songs and slipped them into the mix of classics and if you didn't know, you wouldn't know. If you listen to this and your whole body isn't moving to the beat, you have no soul. The whole band is spot on and the backup vocals are a perfect backdrop of Mr. Isaak's voice. I recommend that you read the booklet that comes with the CD before you play the music, it will add to your pleasure. A truly talented man in a musical world of phonies and posers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|if you want solitaire, this one works well. I was impressed at how well it worked. will probably download other card games from them
0061537934|5.0|I have not ever read a book from a dog's point of view so I was reluctant to read this book--am I ever so glad I picked it up. It is such a beautiful well written story which will stay with me forever.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a very good Solitaire app for Kindle Fire. Works perfectly! Highly recommended over some of the others for Kindle in the app store.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Never heard of that game before, but I love it. Plenty of new weapons and other stuff like that to unlock through achievements. On top of that, this is actually one of the rare games for tablets--in my opinion--that isn't too easy, i.e. it will keep you busy, and sometimes you will even have to start all over because you will have lost your 3 lives.  I got it for free as the App of the Day, but would I pay $0.99 for that game? Yes, any day, any time of the day. Highly recommended.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Really awesome bey! It defeated My Gravity Perseus,Hell Kerbecs,Burn Fireblaze,Thermal Lacerta,Meteo L Drago,Lightning L drago,Burn Lacerta (combo),Ulitmate Meteo L Drago Rush Ver,Evil Gemios,Screw fox,etc etc.It also makes a really good bey for a team.Like with your friends. I made one and its gonna be AWESOMraE!Mine is called Team Wildbreakers. Our beys are Phantom Orion,Hell Kerbecs,Fusion Hades(when we get it),Big Bang Pegasis,(unknown bey)Where was i? Oh Yeah! This toy also has a lot of educational value. Its because physics. The reason Phantom Orion spins so long (give credit to the guy who made the comment)is because the core. When a metal wheel and a core are together it can make the bey spin for a long period of time.When i first got my Phantom Orion it span for 7:23 7 mins 23 secs.After training it for a long long long long time,sometimes it can spin for even 13 mins! I am aiming for half an hour! If it ever does ill die :D But don't treat you bey too rough.It will sooner or later get damaged really badly. I had 3 lightning l dragos and i trained one too hard.It became like,suckful.So i traded it for a Rock Leone.  Face Bolt-Orion. It shows the constellation of Orion and a little bit of Greek myth Orion.  A bunch of people wanna know bout Orion :D And make sure you have Phantom Orion. A combo they showed on the box is a really good combo. its Scythe Giraffe B:D.By the way if some can suggest a good bey for the team i made i will be really thankful. This is ''''''''''''Takara Tomy Metal Fight Beyblade Phantom Orion BB-118. (My son wrote this not me)
0395389496|5.0|I loved this story as a kid in the 80's and was so glad they came out with a movie several years ago. I couldn't wait to get this book for my daughter and was hoping she'd like it as much as I did when I was little. She received it for Christmas and looks at it all the time. She loves both the illustrations and the story. Looking at this book 25+ years after I first read it, I am still amazed at the beautiful illustrations. I think my daughter is going to want to keep reading this book all year long!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Love the case! GOt it today via Amazon Prime two-day free shipping.  Very sturdy and the Color is a beautiful deep matte red. It is perfect for my Kindle Fire. Elastic fits like a glove.

B005J7K964|1.0|I have long wanted Fritz Lang's classic sci-fi masterpiece, so when I got this as a gift I was very excited.  However, I discovered (thankfully before opening it) that it had been colorized, a process that ruins black and white movies.  Then I noticed that the copyright is listed as 1927/1984.  The final blow was the realization that the soundtrack includes the likes of Pat Benitar and Loverboy.  I looked at Amazon to see how the product is described, and it's very confusing.  If you do not know that there are two versions of Metropolis, you do now.  This version has Fritz Lang and Giorgio Morodor listed as directors, and it was presented during the 1984 Academy Awards.  If you like terrible 1980s renderings of 1920s products, get this.  If you think that the Mona Lisa with a mustache is better than the orginal, get this.  If you are a fan of classic cinema and want to see METROPOLIS (not METROPOLIS 2.0), then make sure you get the original Fritz Lang version (http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Metropolis-Blu-ray-Brigitte-Helm/dp/B0040QYROK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1325189089&sr=8-2), which is available on Blu-ray in the most complete state to date.  I repeat: DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU WANT TO SEE FRITZ LANGS' MOVIE!!!
0920668372|5.0|So sad that you feel this book is creepy. You are reading way more into it than you should be. It's just about a mother's love. I don't usually write reviews but some of these reviews are just upsetting.

B0063IH60K|4.0|works well, I have not had any issues with this solitaire app on my kindle fire. cute backgrounds for the cards!
B005LAJ1CC|5.0|I watched this on TV and was wonderfully surprised how well it was done.  As others have said, it is not a sugar coated version nor does it put George on a pedestal, but is a great history and portrait of this man himself.  I consider myself a Beatles fan but there was some information I truly did not remember, other times a review of what I did know.  All in all, Beatles fans/George Harrison fans will be very pleased with this documentary and should at least see it once.  Myself, I'll be on the list to be notified when it is available in the US for purchase.  I do believe it is a must have!
0375413405|5.0|I bought Mastering the art of French Cooking for my daughter for Christmas and she was thrilled with it. It is well written and full of great recipies for the established cook. This cookbook was exactly what I expected and I will probably get her volume 2 as another gift.

0375714839|5.0|If you are a teacher, you might consider teaching \\"Persepolis\\" alongside Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale,\\" a novel about an America taken over by religious fundamentalists. Atwood's novel appears on many high school reading lists, but it is often quite difficult for American students to imagine how a theocracy might come to power and what life might be like under such a government.<br /><br />\\"Persepolis\\" illustrates both of these things. Marjane Satrapi must conceal her body beneath shapeless clothing, cannot easily mingle with the opposite sex, takes care not to say things that might cause her to run afoul of the religious censors, and endures the persecution and even death of those close to her who defy the regime.  Like the Handmaid, she rebels through little things: forbidden cosmetics, whispered conversations, a secret love affair. So much that occurs in the autobiographical \\"Persepolis\\" has its match in \\"The Handmaid's Tale.\\" (Atwood herself visited Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion.)  A reading of  \\"Persepolis\\" (I refer to the complete \\"Persepolis,\\" which moves from Satrapi's childhood to her young adulthood) helps deepen a reading of Atwood's dystopian novel.

B0058RN85O|5.0|The second season is not quite as gut-splitting as the first (some of the material is derivative) but still one of the funniest series I've ever seen.  Not for the tea-party crowd, though.
B005J4TLN4|4.0|A surprisingly enjoyable flick. Obviously it's played for and to a very specific audience - and in many respects, a far cry from the general appeal of its advertised production lineage which includes 'Shaun Of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'.<br /><br />Clearly geared toward the simmering youth markets of various downtrodden cities and townships; I imagine there might be some additional interest among Anglophiles in general. Although I would guess much less Merchant-Ivory territory. &lt;g><br /><br />In many ways this production reminded me of the classic anti-hero flicks '[[ASIN:B000A6T1JU The Warriors]]' from 1979 and '[[ASIN:B0009VBTFK New Jack City]]' from 1991. Ugly and scary subcultures that the mainstream ignored, but that independent flicks discovered; helping to establish deep cult followings amongst inner city kids of the time. And like those films, 'Block' follows a group of young thugs, criminals, and general misanthropic knuckleheads.<br /><br />However unappealing the lead characters, there's a sympathetic resonance in their performance. One that, in my opinion, draws heavily from another scifi classic, '[[ASIN:B00004W3HE The Blob]]' with a very young Steve McQueen. And just like that early film, 'Block' is less about the monster or monsters and more about restless youth and their misplaced energies; a sense that given a challenge - young ones can step up, do right, and save the day.<br /><br />It's an interesting and controversial notion that has its promoters and detractors alike. Suffice to say that, in the context of this flick, I found entertaining.<br /><br />Kudos to young actor John Boyega, he impressed not only as an action star, but as a budding dramatist. And perhaps it was my eyes only, but I could swear this could be Denzel Washington's kid - amazing resemblance. Looking forward to seeing more from him.<br /><br />Loved that the director chose to go partly old school with the monsters - getting tired of the plastic unreality of CGI.

B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I bought this collection for my brother, as he moved from Green Bay to Seattle, and I kept the original VHS collection. It is an excellent addition to any Trekkie fans collection. This is worth purchasing for the price.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I got this with my Kindle Fire and I am really digging it.  It looks like an old book (which I think is cool).  The elastic straps hold it in place very tightly; I've had it over a month and there is no adverse wear or tear on them even after leaving in my hot car in the sun all day.  The suede inside cover keeps the screen clean and protected.  It flips to form a nice holder on my desk.  And, best of all, it makes it *a lot* easier to hold my Fire while reading, browsing, playing.

1934429821|5.0|I discovered Charley Harper's work rather recently and I am in love.  His work always puts a smile on my face and inspires me to be creative.  This book is lovely.  The images are beautifully reproduced and delightful.  The introduction was well-written and fun to read (I usually just skip to the pictures, so this is a compliment to Todd Oldham's writing).  I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that the type in the introduction was small, but it wasn't impossible to read and it helped to turn on my reading light.

B004LROUNG|3.0|I have read quite a few Grisham books over the years, and I have thoroughly enjoyed just about everyone I've read. This latest Grisham volume does not disappoint. It does start a bit slow, but does become a page turner about half way through the book. I enjoyed the read, but would not place it on the same shelf as my favorites like The Rainmaker, The Firm, or even with The Confession. This will prove entertaining to those who are diehard Grisham fans. It was a great escape read.

B004SUWR2C|1.0|I bought the app thinking you could play against other people who own kindle fires, and who have also purchased this app. NOT THE CASE!!  When I called customer service to ask them, of course i couldn't understand what he was saying and he did say he wasn't trained in this field.  He would contact me during the week to let me know...so far i have contacted amazon 6 times this past week and nobody is trained in anything to help the customers anymore
0385737955|5.0|When I got The Maze Runner at my local library I was drawn in by the way Dashner introduced readers to the main character, but didn't tell us anything about him. I knew his identity was going to be a mystery to me until I read the final page. Recently, I've become a fan of dystopian books, and The Maze Runner was one of my first and favorites. I hungrily devoured the book and was surprised to see how many reviews were against it on Amazon. Dashner put enough action in the series to keep me interested, and I loved the way he played with his characters in situations I never expected. Readers can easily bond with the main character, for his intelligence and humor. Dashner weaved and fantastic book filled with humor that had me cracking up, and  shocking outcomes to problems that amazed me. I have read the first two installments in the series, and I can't  wait to get my hands on the third!

0525423281|4.0|I'm going to jump on the Cricket bandwagon.  I. loved. him.<br /><br />However, I do not love his name. Cricket, Stephanie?  Why Cricket?  And here I thought you couldn't get worse than Etienne St. Clair.  I mean, you have these awesome, traditional, if somewhat old-fashioned, girls names with Anna and Lola.. but what is going on with the boy names?!  It's just so hard to take a guy named Cricket seriously.<br /><br />Speaking of Anna and St. Clair - LOVE the cameo's here.<br /><br />So the things I didn't agree with, or that gave me a bad feeling from Anna and her story were still a bit present in this one.  I'm not sure why these stories need to have an element of breaking hearts through the whole flirting-with-cheating storyline, but I am really hoping the third companion book to these will see an end to that little bit.  I didn't like it in Glee Season 1, I don't like it here.<br /><br />But I do love everything else.  I love Lola's sense of fashion, her two dads, her family dynamics, the tension with Calliope, the best friend, the gorgeous boy next door, the history between them ... I could go on and on, but most of all it boils down to just digging with Stephanie Perkins does to make what might otherwise be a hum-drum, teenage story into something like a party in between the pages.<br /><br />Because that's what this book is.  It's a book party.  It makes me happy, giddy, and feel like I\\"m 16 years old again.<br /><br />If you loved Anna, you are gonna love this book.  You haven't read either of them?  Then get off your butt and do so! Libraries, book stores, and friends (I'm sure) will have them laying about, so fix it!
B00526ZKYS|4.0|This, in my opinion, was genius. Sure there were somr slow parts, but as a whole, it made me very excited for the rest of the series! Not really like hunger games in my opinion, though.
B003Y5H5FG|3.0|FRIGHT NIGHT has two saving graces: Anton Yelchin, who plays Charlie<br />Brewster with the right mix of humor and a good grip on his character,<br />and David Tennant who plays the TV vampire destroyer with a good deal<br />of cultivated arrogance and outlandish attitudes.<br /><br />Beyond these performances, the rest of the film is only mildly<br />successful in the casting. Colin Farrell is a disappointment in the<br />role that Chris Sarandon played to perfection as the original \\"vampire<br />next door\\" type with a lot more sexual heat than Colin exhibits in an<br />underplayed style. And even back in 1985, the special effects were a<br />lot more horrifying than those employed here which represent CGI at its<br />worst.<br /><br />But most of all, the entire script has made drastic changes in the<br />story that \\"for better or worse\\" are strictly for the worse. Fans of<br />the original film will hardly recognize what has been done to the<br />story, much less the characters.<br /><br />However, Toni Collette as Brewster's mother and Imogen Poots as his<br />pretty girl friend are excellent, given what material they have to work<br />with, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse gets some comic relief from the Evil<br />Ed character that he becomes after \\"the bite.\\" In this case, his Evil<br />Ed is much less effective than the one in the original film.<br /><br />So many of the key scenes are played in virtual darkness, making it<br />impossible to see what is actually going on at important moments in the<br />action sequences. This is way below standard for a horror film that is<br />supposed to be scaring the audience realistically.<br /><br />Summing up: A waste of time and money. See the original and you'll<br />understand why I lack enthusiasm for this remake which attempts to be<br />stylish and cool and full of rough language.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This DVD came by the estimated time, and I expected the ulraviolet not to work, but in my amazment, within 2 minutes I had it up and ready to watch whenever I bloody felt like it. I definetly suggest that you should by this for yourself or as a gift!
B005LZW8FO|5.0|A school of thought has a seperate world existing for every major decision made on Earth. Another world where John Kennedy wasn't killed, another where Hitler didn't raise to power and another where I didn't go to Nam. Many worlds existing in parallel dimensions.   This movie has one of those other dimensions becomes viable to our Earth, another Earth where someone didn't get drunk and  kill someone. I think it shows raw emotions in a real world without special effects and non stop action.  More like a play.  The movie was made on an extremely limited budget with no special effects and I think if you allow yourself to just flow with the movie, you'll find this to be an entertaining and thought provoking movie. It's unlike most movies you'll see.  I really enjoyed it. If your in doubt, rent it at a Red Box or Blockbuster and decide for yourself.

Woman loves it, I love it, wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />Easy to put on, it feels like its part of the kindle now.  You'll love it.  There are other colors too if you don't like white.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun game.  This is a great game for the price, I usually only download free games and apps, but saw this game on a display kindle at Staples.  My 6 year old son also likes to play it.

B005ZUR724|1.0|Don't waste time or money on this game. It ran well the first day, and then kicked out many players due to an 'update' that is unavailable. Kindle app store is aware of the problem and responded in a timely and responsible manner; however, Gameloft has not responded to any emails to customer service and has not fixed the problem. I recommend a total boycott of Gameloft until such time as they take responsibility for their problems and rectify the situation.
B001GQSY5U|4.0|This was an execellent buy. The kids love it and it was a quick shipment to my home. Just in case you are considering this purchase know that this is not part of the television series but an animated feature which begins Season 1. This edition comes along with a digital copy. This DVD has an excellent picture quality and no disappointment on a Smart TV. It also plays well in van for long trips.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I've been a fan since American Idol. Chris is the real deal. Singer, songwriter, performer. He's got the goods. It's great to have a rock artist putting out great music, CD after CD. Even his B sides CD has some great songs. My personal favorite BTS track is 'Losing My Mind.' I'm a product of '80s rock and this CD brings me back without sounding too dated. Great melodies are great no matter when they are released!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|It's a fitting end for a wonderful series. At first, I wasn't happy that the last movie was split into two movies, but I felt that they did a good job with the split and keeping the plot moving. This last movie covers one day, but that one day takes up 1/3 of the book. It has great action and my favorite scene from the entire series was Snape's Worst Memories. It was incredibly moving and explained everything while tying in all the books. It was amazing. Great movie.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|Like I said, Dynomite! The price is UNBEATABLE, especially when it comes with a screen protector. It would be worth the price if it hadn't have came with a screen protector - that is just an added bonus! I have a re-usable screen protector that I am using, so I can't review on the quality of the one it came with. But, the Iphone case - I love it! I have been using Apple products since they first came out with the Ipod and have always loved the look of their products. It has always bummed me out to have to buy a cover and 'cover' up the neat design of Apple products. Alas, this Iphone case came along. It fits around the phone all snuggly like and is a nice, thick, and bendable plastic (not rigid!). It fits nice and tight around the phone but still allows you to see the Iphone (I have white and have always loved the white Apple products). So, a big, fat, thumbs up for this Iphone cover - its nice to finally NOT have to cover up my Iphone to keep it protected. And with the price - knocks it out of the park!
0060555661|5.0|This is my second time reading \\"The Intelligent Investor\\".  It has more quality information and valuable teachings than I can grasp in one or two readings.  I think the next time I read it through I will need to sit down with it and treat it as a text book to be studied thouroughly.  Have my investment strategies improved since I read it the first time, definitely yes.  As I read it the second time I am happy that I have adheared to many of the principles in the book, but still have to resist the urge to be a \\"speculator\\" in the market and stick to being an \\"investor\\" instead.  I wish this had been a required reading when I started business school 20 years ago.  I could have avoided many mistakes I made in my financial life before I read the book the first time.

Come, let me describe things endlessly because I am a monologue. Look at this tea! It is warm and in a cup, is it not? Please do not be alarmed by my apparent intention to humanise a fundamentalist, for I will use such dated and condescending language as to make myself appear so smug and superior as to render the point, my friend, moot.<br /><br />But I will talk forever, like those butterflies you have just observed flirting with the semi-naked girls in the half-dark dusty musky exotic misogynistic streets. Ah, let me just say \\"ah\\" when my plot seems stuck and I can't even clumsily work in a response from you, my silent audience (hey, that's you, you western jerk). But look, because my narrative structure is so poor, here is our waiter with more tea.\\"<br /><br />Blah, blah, blah. An entirely bad monologue apparently probing what any semi-intelligent person would have already considered.
0545128285|4.0|This is one of those books that won't make or break a series. Either it will add to it, or it will blow over. In this case, I think it adds a depth to the Harry Potter series, despite not focusing on the main plot.<br /><br />Like Quidditch Through the Ages and Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, this books adds small details surrounding the world for loyal fans.<br /><br />This particular book shows fairy tales of the wizarding world. We're all aware of the tales parents read their children nowadays, read to them in the past, and will in the future. Classics: Stories most people know of, even if they haven't experienced them first-hand.<br /><br />In this short extra, J.K. Rowling gives us a look into that same aspect for the other side of our world. There's no Cinderella or Snow White, but what we do have works just as well. The Tale of The Three Brothers is easily what spawns the most interest in readers, due to its connection with the main series. Even so, the other stories weave intriguing and funny aspects together in a way that J.K. Rowling has become famous for.<br /><br />She draws readers into these little tales and brings them that much closer to the wizarding world. There's evil, humor and joy in these wizarding fairy tales, much like there is in our muggle ones.<br /><br />All in all, this collection of five tales for children is a book I will recommend. Not just to young fans, but older fans, and, of course, parents with children.<br /><br />Let's experience the wizarding world in all its glory.

B0053B347M|4.0|From ready the reviews I didn't know what to expect from these. I bought them for my TV, to have non direct light when watching movies, or playing games. I installed four strips plugged into [[ASIN:B000Q8UAWY Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub (F5U407)]] on the back of my 55\\" LED, and I have to say it looks amazing. With four these is plenty of light, without being overwhelming. My girlfriend even likes the look when we watch movies. When I get a chance I'll post pics of what four of these look like on my TV.

B000001ABD|3.0|Stevie Wonder's double CD 'Song Review' is a puzzling but baffling collection that left me scratching my head.This collection has songs that are already available on previous compilations.'Song Review'is an oddly thrown together hodgepodge with tracks that start the collection from the mid-eighties then switches to the early to late seventies and rewinds back to the sixties.Wonder's sixties and early seventies tracks do not belong on this CD compilation which should've focused on material recorded between 1982-1995.<br /><br />This 2 CD set is inconsistent and is an odd mixture of decades mixed in together with no consistent flow.Wonder's 1982 'ORIGINAL MUSIQUARIUM I'was more consistent and concentrated on the 2ND phase of his remarkable career and has a consistent flow to the classic double album,'Song Review' does not.It did however include songs such as Part-Time Lover/I just Called To Say I Love You/Overjoyed/Ebony&Ivory/For Your Love/You Will Know/These Three Words/Lovelight In Flight.<br /><br />These songs deserve to be on this collection,but more songs from his 1982-1996 time capsule should've been added to better enhance this collection.The only thing that saved this bizarre collection was the inclusion of the then four new songs:Stay Gold(from the 1983 original motion picture soundtrack,'The Outsiders')/Kiss Lonely Goodbye(from the 1996 original motion picture soundtrack,'The Adventures of Pinocchio')/Hold On To Your Dream and the remake of the legendary Bob Marley's 'Redemption Song'<br /><br />Here is a more complete compilation from 1982-1995 for this collection which should be re-titled to 'STEVIE WONDER'S ORIGINAL MUSIQUARIUM II'<br /><br />DISC ONE:<br />Used To Be(Duet with Charlene)(1982)<br />Ebony&Ivory(Duet with Paul McCartney)(1982)<br />Stay Gold(from the original motion picture soundtrack,'The Outsiders')(1983)<br />I Just Called To Say I Love You (original longer album version)(1984)<br />It's You(duet with Dionne Warwick)(1984)<br />Weakness(duet with Dionne Warwick)(1984)<br />Lovelight In flight(1984)<br />Part-Time Lover(1985)<br />I Love You Too Much(1985)<br />Go Home(1985)<br />Overjoyed(1985)<br />You Will Know(1987)<br />With Each Beat Of My Heart(1987)<br />Dark 'N Lovely(1987)<br />Get It(duet with Michael Jackson)(1987)<br /><br />DISC TWO:<br />Skeletons(1987)<br />My Eyes Don't Cry(1987)<br />These Three Words(1991)<br />Make Sure You're Sure(1991)<br />Fun Day(1991)<br />Gotta Have You(1991)<br />Queen In The Black(1991)<br />Sensuous Whisper(1995)<br />Cold Chill(1995)<br />Edge Of Eternity(1995)<br />Taboo To Love(1995)<br />For Your Love(1995)<br />Kiss Lonely Goodbye(from the original motion picture soundtrack,'The Adventures Of Pinocchio')(1996)<br />Hold On To Your Dream(1996)<br />Redemption Song(a remake of a classic Bob Marley track)(1996)<br /><br />This revamped song line-up would've been a by far better compilation collection by having the CD/album cover just like 'MUSIQUARIUM I'with a different color with the fish and should've been retitled to 'STEVIE WONDER'S ORIGINAL MUSIQUARIUM II' and like 'MUSIQUARIUM I'before it 'Song Review' did include 4 new songs:Stay Gold/Kiss Lonely Goodbye/Hold On To Your Dream/Redemption Song (Stevie and Motown missed the boat on this release had it been compiled the way i have the included track listing)s(duet with Dionne Warwick)(1984)<br />Lovelight In flight(1984)<br />Part-Time Lover(1985)<br />I Love You Too Much(1985)<br />Go Home(1985)<br />Overjoyed(1985)<br />You Will Know(1987)<br />With Each Beat Of My Heart(1987)<br />Dark 'N Lovely(1987)<br />Get It(duet with Michael Jackson)(1987)<br /><br />DISC TWO:<br />Skeletons(1987)<br />My Eyes Don't Cry(1987)<br />These Three Words(1991)<br />Make Sure You're Sure(1991)<br />Fun Day(1991)<br />Gotta Have You(1991)<br />Queen In The Black(1991)<br />Sensuous Whisper(1995)<br />Cold Chill(1995)<br />Edge Of Eternity(1995)<br />Taboo To Love(1995)<br />For Your Love(1995)<br />Kiss Lonely Goodbye(from the original motion picture soundtrack,'The Adventures Of Pinocchio')(1996)<br />Hold On To Your Dream(1996)<br />Redemption Song(a remake of a classic Bob Marley track)(1996)<br /><br />This revamped song line-up would've been a by far better compilation collection by having the CD/album cover just like 'MUSIQUARIUM I'with a different color with the fish and should've been retitled to 'STEVIE WONDER'S ORIGINAL MUSIQUARIUM II' and like 'MUSIQUARIUM I'before it 'Song Review' did include 4 new songs:Stay Gold/Kiss Lonely Goodbye/Hold On To Your Dream/Redemption Song (Stevie and Motown missed the boat on this release had it been compiled the way i have the included track listing)

B004DLPXAO|2.0|I recently downloaded this app to my Motorola Xoom in hopes that I might download my school books to it. Unfortunately that did not work. For some reason my Xoom is not a supported device for those particular books. I can get other books just not the ones that I need. I am working with customer support to solve the issue, they are very prompt with their responses. I hope that my patience pays off and I will let all of you Xoom users out there know the outcome of this.<br />  As far as the application itself, it works rather well with some minor flaws that could use some addressing. Its rather easy to use but as other reviews have stated the \\"furthest point\\" feature tends to not work when switching between devices. On the Xoom it doesn't let you know what page you are on, it merely displays a percentage, and when I am using my school books on my PC it is rather tedious trying to find resource information located in the back of the book.<br />  Once the Amazon people fix the issues with my Xoom this will be a decent four-star application. I hope you all find this useful.

B005ZUR724|4.0|I'm upping my review from 1 star to 4 since they have since addressed the update issue.  I am going to give Gameloft the benefit of the doubt and assume that the issue was unique to Kindle and stemmed from having to manage a separate app for this particular device and store.<br /><br />Anyway- the game itself is quite fun.  For any one who has played WoW, LotRO, Rift or any other recent MMO, O&C should be familiar territory.  The game feels very much like WoW did a few years ago.  The quests are kind of grindy, but the graphics and UI are impressive for a mobile device.<br /><br />The only gripes I have with it stem from the fact that it feels like WoW used to.  The genre has moved on a bit since The Burning Crusade, but this game is still firmly rooted in this time.  If you're used to friendly quest hubs, varied quests and complicated rotations, O&C may feel dated.<br /><br />Even at $1 per month, this game won't take WoW's place as my main MMO.  It's a fun diversion with a bunch of promise, but it's not polished and up-to-date enough to keep my attention for the long haul.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I like the season, its like the other two very unpredictable. I have no idea which way the story is going to go. At first I thought they would run out of story lines from season two but the writers are freaking awesome! I can't wait for Jan. 5th to start the season up again to see what's going to happen and to see how they will end the season leaving me waiting for the fourth season to start. TVD tv show is like a really really good book, a real page turner, you can't get enough. I know its based on the book but the the show surpasses the book. For the third season again the writers are awesome, the actors are brillant, and the director totally rocks.!
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|A coworker of mine received this as a gift one year and she loved it. My boyfriend is a huge Harry Potter fan... So I got it for him for Christmas. SO COOL. TOTALLY WORKS. He lovvvvved it. Even none Harry Potter enthusiasts think its neat. Totally works. Pretty easy to set up. Only takes like an hour of training. Super awesome. Yeah. I'm the best girlfriend ever. Lol
B002RSDW80|5.0|I loved the book. I love the movie even more. Meryl Streep captures the essence of the Julia Child that I watched on TV years ago. Delightful. And the movie really brings Julie to life - I wish that I knew someone like her.
0307387178|3.0|after watching the movie \\"into the wild\\" i was immediately curious about christopher mccandless and had hoped to find or understand more about him by reading this book. while the book offers more details surrounding his life, outdoor adventures, letters to friends, and his death, i was a bit confused by some of the other material. for example in about the middle of the book you run into a couple of chapters about past outdoor adventurers who met the same demise as mccandless. interesting? yes, but i think this segment would have been better suited at the beginning or the end of the book so the reader is not taken so far off track. also, following these stories you are faced with a couple of chapters of the past experiences and life of john krakauer. intersting? no, not really. if i were reading a book about him then sure, or if these experiences were met during the investigation of mccandless i would better accept them, but as is stands i was not in the least bit interested in krakauers story.   in the end the book is great. christopher mccandless was an interesting and intriguing young man. i enjoyed reading about him and his life and really enjoyed the movie.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|After receiving the Kindle Fire I decided it would be best to purchase a protective sleeve for when I am traveling.  I purchased this sleeve and couldn't be more pleased.  It is the perfect size for the Kindle Fire and protects the screen from scratches.  I don't think a simple drop would cause damage either, however I wouldn't drop this from a great height as this isn't designed for that.  I was also pleased to find that it holds my Kindle 3rd Gen (Keyboard) as well.  I am purchasing another one just for that reason.  If you don't want the cumbersome case but want to keep your Fire or Kindle protected I recommend this sleeve.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game. works well on the kindle fire. I highly recommend downloading.  it is free.  cannot go wrong with that.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game with many nice levels passes much time its also a great fingers exercise .  why this app is action /adventure games ,it doesn't matter lol download the app!
1401233066|5.0|We return to the realm of Fables in this 16th volume as our heroes continue their battle against Mr. Dark.  In the last volume Frau Totenkinder's battle against Mr. Dark has failed and the fables have been forced to retreat to Haven and Flycatcher cannot hold the barrier against him much longer.  But all is not lost.  Pinocchio and Ozma have hit upon a plan to pull their most powerful heroes together to form a superteam to tackle and defeat Mr. Dark.  They've picked superhero names, costumes, and everything and are almost ready for the battle.  But before their battle can begin Bigby and his father, the North Wind, have to settle the issue of Ghost, Bigby's invisible zephyr cub.  And then...everything takes an unexpected turn and some surprising events happen before Mr. Dark is defeated.  In other stories we get to check in with Bufkin, our hero of the lost business office, who manages to find his way back to his homeworld of Oz in \\"The Ascent\\" and continues his quest to be the best hero he can be.  And we also check in with our lost hero Sleeping Beauty in \\"Waking Beauty.\\"<br /><br />I can see why there are some mixed reviews about this collection as the battle against Mr. Dark feels very anticlimactic compared to the previous one with Frau Totenkinder.  There isn't the big explosion or the epic last battle.  It's just not what you really expect at all.  And yet...I like how it all goes down.  It fits well within the Fables world, much like how Geppetto was finally defeated and it's going to lead the gang down a very different path than what many people I think expected.  The artwork is again absolutely fantastic and I'm always impressed with the effects that they manage to pull off, such as the final battle with Mr. Dark.  It just has such great imagery and such great character design.<br /><br />I do have a couple of niggling little doubts, not related to the battle but to a couple of events that happen within it.  One involves one of the Fables picked to be on the superteam, and I'll avoid mentioning much since it would be a spoiler, but this Fable suddenly loses their \\"power\\" and not much is ever mentioned more of it.  I'm sure it will crop up in later issues, but it just left me feeling like I missed pages that talked more about what happened.  The second little issue I have is that we finally get a glimpse of the person who roused Rose Red from her bed in the previous collection.  It's almost presented like we should know who she is, but we don't.  Again I'm sure that Bill will reveal all in good time it just bugged me a bit that we didn't get more information about these two circumstances.<br /><br />Even with the two niggling doubts Bill Willingham has created a fantastic universe and continues to surprise me with the direction he's able to take the series.  I have no doubt that my questions will be answered in future volumes and I look forward to seeing where he goes with the story.ll avoid mentioning much since it would be a spoiler, but this Fable suddenly loses their \\"power\\" and not much is ever mentioned more of it.

B001CDLATE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Make the time to watch it with your full attention and you will be changed. As for the Blu-ray: I had watched it dozens of times on \\"regular\\" DVD, so I wasn't sure how much better it could be on Blu-ray. It turns out that the movie is so intensely visual that its impact is dramatically amplified in the higher-resolution format.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|was very pleased with this purchase and how quickly I recieved the cd. I will use this company again and the price was just right for my budget
B003NFM3JU|2.0|Based upon past reviews I was expecting a wonderful story and excellent 3-D effects.  This movie fails in both departments.  What I was most stunned with, in a negative way, was the corruption of Dickens' story.  How dare screenwriter and director Robert Zemeckis give but a passing glance to Tiny Tim's predicament, Scrooge's lost love, and the joy Scrooge used to have in his heart as a young man.  If the viewer had never seen any past presentations of this story I doubt they could have easily followed, what should have been, clear, emotion filled moral points. Instead, the lack of emotion generating scenes made this a cold, get it done and over with feeling the director must have had in his heart about this entire project.  The difference in volume between the soft spoken scenes and the loud special audio effects was too vast.  It was as though the dialog wasn't considered as important as the crashing and banging.  Also, the needlessly overt visual darkness of most of the movie seemed to be a cheap after thought that was used to try to add an ominous feeling since the directing and script and acting didn't do it.  Speaking of visuals, the 3-D rendering was a complete disappointment.  At best there were a few 5% out of screen moments.  Compared to other 3-D movies this was woefully lacking.  Add to that many out of focus shots and the 3-D version fell flat on it's face.  By no means ever use this movie to showcase your 3-D system to your friends.  They would leave smiling inside at their wise purchase of just a normal television.  I had really been looking forward to this movie.  I ended up shaking my head in disappointment concerning everything about it.  Shame on Disney for releasing this as some sort of accomplishment.

B000002KFJ|5.0|Black Sabbath from 1970 to 1978 consisted of Ozzy Osbourne on vocals, Tony Iommi on lead guitar, Bill Ward on drums, Terry \\"Geezer\\" Butler on bass guitar. This album is kind of an enigma for Sabbath reviewers. Most consider this album to be their best all around release while a vocal minority consider Paranoid or Master of Reality to be their best. If you ask me, I would not consider Sabotage to be their best, that prize would have to go to Master of Reality, but it is certainly Sabbath's last \\"great\\" album. Sabotage took almost a year to produce and complete. A far cry from the old days when they recorded their first release Black Sabbath for a measley 900 dollars U.S! It was produced by the band themselves. Sound quality is not that great. The original master tapes were not produced that well so the sound quality suffered. Static and tape hiss can be heard at times.     This is most likely Ozzy's finest performance on a Black Sabbath record. He can still hit the high notes quite well and his nasal vocal syle is in abundance. Butler's bass Guitar is pushed back in the mix but not too much that he is not noticeable. He is rather laid back in showing his talent but he does shine through in places. The real star of the show is Iommi's lead guitar work. He has always been at the top of the heavy metal world in terms of coming up with heavy and catchy guitar riffs mostly because he virtually created the genre in the late 60s. Bill Ward's drumming is up to par with every other Sabbath album he performed on. Not his best performance but far from his worst. During the making of Sabotage the band was involved in a legal battle with their management. I have read from various sources that management may have been hiding or maybe possibly even stealing money from the band members. Whatever the case may be Sabbath won the legal battle and as a result we have this album.   The opening tune Hole In The Sky starts with near silence. Then about eight seconds into the song the mainriff is unleashed onto your speakers. Soon after Ozzy Osbourne joins the fun and there is no turning back. The lyrics are straight forward as usual. This is what I love about the band. Their straight forward approach works out very well because you do not have to spend all day trying to figure out what the band is trying to say.The guitar solo starts of the middle section before reverting back to the main riff before ending the song in a very strange but effective way. Instead of ending the song by fading it out, the song just ends while the riff is still being played. It's a very neat idea that worked out well.   The next song is not really a song at all. It is the intro to the next song called Symptom Of The Universe. The riff in this song may be Iommi's finest. It's certainly in the top five out of literaly hundreds of Tony Iommi riffs! The song writing of this song is nothing short of amazing. About four minutes into the song an acoustic guitar comes into play. The genius is it goes from really heavy in the first four minutes and then the last two minutes or so are peaceful. Awesome track.   Megalomania is the albums centerpiece and masterpiece as well. The song features many different riffs in its ten minute running time. The first half of the track is more laid back then the second half. But don't let that fool you. This song gets very heavy towards the mid section and does not let up after that. Thrill Of It All is another track worth hearing. There is a lot of guitar feedback on this tune that just adds to the heaviness. However the songs mid section is kind of uninspired and flat. But the song is worth hearing. The next track is another boring instrumental called Supertzar. Except this one is more painful because it is way overlong at over three minutes in length. The track features some kind of choir singing a chant. Very cheesy and takes some of the power away from the other tracks as well. Some fans love it though I can not see why. Am I going Insane (radio) is another dud. The song features Ozzy repeating the song title for over four minutes with Iommi coaxing weird feedback sounds out of his guitar that always seems to give me a headache. The albums final song is called The Writ. The track features many time and riff changes which the band uses a lot. Overall this album is their last true masterpiece. After this record the magic was not at the apex that it was on Sabotage. Probably the only reason this album is not their best is because of the filler songs I mentioned in my review. However the other five songs are well worth your time AND money.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very easy to play, quick moves,no freezing up, win often with either random or winning deal. Doesn't slow down kindle fire at all.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Let me first start off by saying I was skeptic of purchasing this cd, much because I wasn't a fan of the anthem of \\"Run the World (Girls)\\". However, I am learning that music sounds much better to me in my car. LOL!!! I guess I have a really good sound system in my car:) But moving on, I actually find this cd very empowering. In my personal opinion, this is Beyonce's most powerful cd to date.<br /><br />Now I'm not a famous critic, so I'm not just saying this so that they'll seek me out, for the future. But this is a very mature sound from Beyonce and the music shows how much she's had to grow up over the last few years.<br /><br />My favorite song on 4 is entitled \\"I Miss You\\". It's a light ballad. But I'd put money on it, that this song was written about her father, who she relinguished from managing her career, last year. This song is a like a talking page from her diary. And the way she sings it, assures me that she'd had some reservations and misses his presence from her business life deeply. But again, I could be wrong. But I'm almost certain I'm not.<br /><br />My second favorite song is a tie between \\"Runs the World (Girls)\\" ...I know right, but it sounds so much better to me, since I purchased the cd... and \\"Countdown\\". The Runs the World anthem is so catchy and the beat is ridiculous!!! But the lyrics ring true...women have the ability to persuade people to do anything they want (Genesis is true evidence of that. But that talent may not always be best. Remember Eve? IJS!). We are an influential group of people. And based on the growth of Beyonce, she and Oprah are some of the best representation of how strong and prevailing we can be!!! Countdown has my heart, because it samples one of my favorite songs \\"Uh Ahh\\" by Boyz II Men...need I say more!!! Without that sample, the track wouldn't have been as hot! But it's still going to be a club banger, I'm sure.<br /><br />I have to say that I could listen to the majority of this cd without touching the dial. Although, I will say my least favorite is \\"Rather Die Young\\". It was a little too sappy for my taste, so I pressed forward and from there I was deeply satisfied.<br /><br />The remainder of the cd is awesome in my opinion! And this is the appropriate amount and quality of songs to let everyone know that Beyonce is Here (she even has a song about it, \\"I Am Here\\" #11 on the cd). And from the success that I know this album is going to garner, she's not going anywhere anytime soon. I see Grammys from this album for sure!!!ather Die Young\\". It was a little too sappy for my taste, so I pressed forward and from there I was deeply satisfied.  The remainder of the cd is awesome in my opinion!

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie initially caught my attention because I knew Temple Grandin personally (there's a movie made about someone I know, how cool is that?!). When I attended Colorado State University, I attended a lecture she gave to pre-veterinary students and she was a guest lecturer in one of my courses. Her insight into animal behavior and their ways of thinking is fascinating. Clare Danes does an excellent job of capturing Ms. Grandin's personality and mannerisms. If you have ever wondered what it would be like to see the world in a different way or how hard life would be as an autistic person, this movie is a wonderful insight.
1400069181|4.0|Start Something That Matters ©2011 by Blake Mycoskie<br />Book review/summary by Dr. Denice Moffat<br /><br />I remember an old story from years back where two shoe salesmen from two competing companies went to a third world country to check out marketing opportunities for their companies. The first man came back home and told his boss, \\"Forget that idea. We'll go broke on the project. Nobody wears shoes there.\\" Blake Mycoskie must have been the second salesman. After returning from Argentina in 2002 he saw that nobody there wore shoes and decided there was a HUGE market. It dawned on him that this may be the way to make a positive difference in the world as well as these people were very poor indeed. So, he started a company to provide shoes for these people who didn't have any and didn't wear any. He created TOMS shoes, a \\"for profit\\" company that generates enough funds to give one pair of shoes away for each pair sold. One for one. What a concept.<br /><br />Blake's idea so infused his initial interns that many have become long-term very dedicated employees. To date, over one million pairs of shoes have been donated to the underprivileged.<br />But Blake has not stopped there. His first book just out, Start Something That Matters presents inspirational stories of TOMS and other companies who have also had wonderful ideas of how to make our world a better place. Blake is challenging his readers to create and start more things that matter.<br /><br />So, how does a young inspired naïve gentleman who had never made a pair of shoes, attended fashion school or worked in retail create one of the fastest growing footwear companies in the world by giving shoes away? Incredible isn't it? Well, Blake Mycoskie, owner and mastermind of TOMS shoes tells us how and gives examples.<br /><br />The examples in the book talk frankly of the challenges Blake and other companies have overcome and of ideas on how to make it easier for the rest of us who also want to make a difference in our world. Here's an overview of the book:<br /><br />Some Components to Models of Success:<br /><br />Share a powerful story filled with wonderful mind pictures. For example, when Jared Fogle was desperate to lose weight a few years back he decided to only eat the lowest fat Subway sandwiches every day. Day after day. After losing 100# the news picked up the story and dubbed his process the Subway Sandwich Diet. It was an overnight success. People don't remember facts and statistics. They remember the story. Share your story with everyone you can. Find people who also want to share your story.<br /><br />Engage larger companies into partnering with your story. Big companies are always looking for human interest projects. Pick a project you are passionate about so that when the going gets tough you'll have the extra shot of energy to keep going. Surround yourself with energetic people.<br /><br />Make a good impression on the internet. Your online persona should represent what you stand for.<br /><br />Face your fears. There IS no good time to start. Blake writes, \\"People tend to think that they should start something only when they are totally and completely knowledgeable about the field they want to enter.\\" But sometimes you just have to take the leap of faith and build your wings on the way down. No project is ever perfect from the beginning. The timing will never be perfect. There will always be trials, but life continues to move on, so just jump in and get your feet wet.<br /><br />Live your story. If you can't, then maybe it's not the right story for you.<br /><br />Be charitable: Making a profit is a great goal, but what if you could also accomplish a larger mission at the same time as you make a living? Get inspired. The businesses in Start Something That Matters are making a profit AND changing the world.<br /><br />Start small. Small improvements made daily lead to massive improvements within a very short time.<br /><br />Seek as much advice as you can from a variety of people and sources. You'll be surprised how many people will give freely of their time to help a new upstart if they feel the person is honest and sincere.<br /><br />Imagination often trumps money. Use what resources you have. Be frugal. People who invest funds into a startup company may not appreciate you spending lavishly when you could be investing those funds into something inventive and more useful to the long term health of the business. Why purchase a 3-bin color copy machine when a one-bin black and white would do?<br /><br />Develop a presence where it's free. Use social media. Space matters but you often don't need to have an office to start. Borrow some space (or their address in a ritzy part of town) from a friend or work out of your garage. Use business cards--if you don't have any, then write on the back of somebody else's (it helps of course if the person's card is somebody that has a big name).<br /><br />Keep things simple. Keep the work space and business models uncluttered. Specialize in a specific passion. Become a minimalist. Combine activities. Keep a schedule. Always carry a notebook to write down ideas on and minimize, cull or eliminate energy suckers that drag you down and keep you from experiencing your greater good.<br /><br />Forget titles. Everyone is important when you're developing a team. It's hard to be a team player when egos take hold. Reward employees.<br /><br />Build trust both inside and outside your company. \\"A leader can create a company, but a community creates a movement,\\" says Blake. So rectify your errors--if you have a product defect then make it right--even if it involves a recall of the product.<br /><br />Have a zero-tolerance policy for badmouthing other employees. Eliminate the bad apples if they violate company trust--even if it means letting a very talented person go. The rest of the team will be more trusting, work harder and will develop a better bond.<br /><br />Empower your employees. Mr. Mycoskie says that there is a direct correlation between job satisfaction and how empowered people are to fully execute their job without a micromanager hovering over them.<br /><br />Be as transparent and open as possible. People donate more often if they know the money will go directly to what the project is all about. If you can, have individuals or organizations underwrite your operational costs so this can be done. Be frugal with your money. People don't appreciate their donation going to fancy offices, high salaries and extravagant operational expenses.<br /><br />Use your own products. If you don't believe in your product and use it, why should others?<br /><br />Be a giver. Giving makes it easier to attract both great employees and wonderful partners. Give more than dollars. Give of your talents. It's easy to get overwhelmed with where to begin--there are so many things to donate to. When feeling that heaviness of not knowing where to put your time, talents, love or dollars, take a few minutes to refocus on just one project or even just one person to donate to.<br /><br />Know your audience and ask questions. Really listen to the answers before tailoring the gift to make it most impactful. Craft your business to support those people you want to appeal to.<br />The most important thing though is to take the first step and just start something!<br /><br />Blake's' ideas for free media exposure is worth twice the price of his book, but even so, purchasing his book supports a one-for-one book company that donates a new book to a child in need for every copy of Start Something That Matters sold.

B000NMW6J8|5.0|Fine performances abound and the plot is timely, topical, and rivetting.  This is not formulaic and is a roller coaster ride from start to finish.  Definitely worth watching.
1601251505|5.0|I picked up two copies after friends expressed interest in getting back to our roots. I really hated 3.5, however this looks like it will end up being our long running game from now on. Lots of customization from the core rulebook and when we finally decide to buy more it looks like we could really go a lot of ways with it. The starting classes are much better than 3.5.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Ok, when I ordered my Fire I was excited but since I commute everyday in NYC I needed a case.  The $40 case was ridiculous so I ordered one for $19 and used it until today when I received this case.  The first case looked like I had a day planner and was so big it was useless.  This is small and light.  Exactly what I wanted.  Is it perfect? No! Is the kindle Fire perfect? No! It is a compromise as is the case.  Maybe eventually they will make a case that matches the Fire...
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Martin wins again. I've been reading through this series since just before the HBO show came out and love it. Clash of Kings really expanded the world without feeling overwhelmed. And after that ending, I immediately bought storm of swords!
B005K17RU0|3.0|I was not able to add my hometown. The app kept bringing another city closely named. I kept deleting and reentering, but never could get it to stick, so I chose a city nearby.  For a free app, it's alright.  It's easy to read and operate.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|I absolutely love this movie and it just came in, and I opened it today.  I bought it because I didn't believe the people who said that the Saphire series dvd was bad quality.  Unfortunately they were right.  The picture looks good but the frames skip about 5 times every minute.  I am still watching it as we speak because I love the movie so much but I'm pretty upset that the frames are messed up.  I'm sure it depends on which DVD you get but now I actually believe some of the people on here - when before I didn't.  There's no way I could ever watch this again, and will have to return it but I was so pumped about watching it I'm still watching it out of principal and then its getting returned.  Bottom line: you may get a Gladiator movie that works good, you may not.  I was unlucky I guess...so just know that there is a definite chance that you will not be satisfied with this dvd.  Which makes me very sad, I was just trying to watch my man Maximus do some work in the ring.  Good luck people.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Goods movie and i'm looking forward to buying the second part thru Amazon cause they have the best prices around for movies

B001BPQT8A|1.0|The review written below was written prior to actually trying to view the disc *I* received. This is a gorgeous book, as below, but as other reviewers have commented, this disc does not work in PS3 even with firmware updates. It also did not work in my Panasonic BR disc player with firmware updates. It also did not work in my brand new high-end laptop with Blu Ray Player built in. I've seen the movie in BR..it is phenomenal.. but this one is going back to Amazon.<br /><br />\\"Become Vengeance, David, become Wrath..\\"<br />This is a review of the BLU RAY BOOK of SE7EN<br /><br /> I was a little confused about exactly what I was getting - some reviews said 2 disks, etc.  For clarification, this is one disk with 4 Commentary features, extended scenes and alternate endings, Notebooks of \\"John Doe's Writings\\", Still Photographs and trailers. What is special is that the movie is in a case that opens and reads like a hardback book.  I have had NO trouble with pages falling out, but I do not try to pry the book all the way open. It is easily opened and easily read  with beautiful, glossy pages of each of the grisly scenes, actor pages, etc.  I just could not be happier with this, and got it at a wonderful price on a Gold Box Deal Day !<br /><br />Oh.. and I also read some people had trouble with packaging. My \\"Book\\" Arrived very securely packaged with no damage whatsoever. Unfortunately, the disc did not play in ANY of the BR players I have at my house.
B006C1DH92|5.0|This.game is great, entertaining fun, and wonderful. While I am giving it 5 stars it does not have an achievements page, you do get to see the name of the achievement. when you complete it, but there is no way to see how.you.got it or how to get others. Great hams by halfbrick though.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Everything about this transaction went smoothly....I recommend this product to anyone and everyone enjoying the HP Universe.  Amazon performed flawlessly.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|This device is awesome. It works great with your mainstream First Person Shooter games like Modern Warfare, Battlefield, etc.......some better than others. But it works.  I also noticed I play better with this device since I am using the keyboard and mouse just like a PC gamer.  I made a few videos on youtube on this device. My Youtube channel name is GlockNinja. Go check out the videos.   Pros: Works great. Allows you to use keyboard and mouse just like on a PC in shooting games.  Allows you to play better.   Cons: Can be a little confusing to set up at first. But once you got it set up....its fun fun fun. If I can figure it out...you can.   Conclusion:  If you like PC gaming with keyboard and mouse...this device is a must have for your PS3.  I love it.  Best $50 I spent on a accessory for my PS3.  :-)
B003Y3AZSW|5.0|I really like these cutting boards. Easy to store, right size for everyday use and the stainless steel holder fits well with my kitchen decor.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a fun and entertaining game. it has a beautiful layout and relaxing music. I would recommend this game to anyone of any age.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Bought this item for a Christmas present. It came quickly and the recipient has enjoyed it immensely. Always good service from Amazon.com.
B005I6EU7U|2.0|I liked the looks of this cover but it doesn't fit properly. The kindle fits fine but when you fold the cover it is not snug. Ours had a gap of almost 1/2 inch. We live in a dusty area and need a better seal then this cover provides. I'm returning it.
B004EYM0EC|4.0|I recently saw this band open up for Evanescence. Took a few songs but I started to get into them. Definitely recommend seeing them and the cd.
B004J713JW|4.0|I loved this on NPR, so bought it for a 40 year old Joel fan. The editorial review on Amazon's web page is accurate, listing guest appearances by other artists who played here and the set list.  This is a real piece of nostalgia as well as a reminder of Billy's great contributions to rock and roll.
B003UESJ9M|4.0|My daughter recommended this movie.  She is a country music fan. I enjoyed the movie.  A little predictable.  Good music.  Entertaining.
B003ODL004|5.0|I'm not much of a Hans Zimmer fan.  Admittedly, I liked the Pirates sequels and even his music for the short-lived NBC series \\"The Contender.\\"  Still, nothing he ever did completely knocked my socks off.  With Inception, though, not only did he knock my socks off, I can't find them anymore.<br /><br />It's a score like this that I just love playing on a loud sound system.  It's made for a big home theater system with a wide frequency range.  The basses are so deep!<br /><br />The album is gapless, so keep that in mind when importing.  Specifically, the track \\"Dream is Collapsing\\" seems to be up-cut a little.  The first note is spliced by the track change.  So, if you listen to the previous track and that one together, it sounds fine, but if you're like me, and you want to hear \\"Time\\" and \\"Dream is Collapsing\\" together like at the end of the movie, you might be a little disappointed in that up-cut.<br /><br />Regardless, it's still a terrific score, and I'm still willing to give it a 5.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|When I first heard that there was to be an American production of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" I had some qualms. Not uncommonly, an American version of some movie can be so commercialized that the heart of the original movie disappears. Such is most definitely NOT the case today.<br /><br />If one has seen the Swedish version, it is impossible not to compare them and make some judgments. Noomi Rapace was terrific as Lisbeth Salander, the quirky, antisocial genius, filled with all manner of skills that would not be expected from her prickly exterior. Needless to say, I wondered how Rooney Mara would handle this character, one of the more interesting literary figures in recent years. Not to worry. Her take on Salander is different from Rapace, but it works very well. And this is critical. The movie revolves around Salander and her peculiar character. If this character doesn't work, the movie would fail. Mara provides a sense of Lisbeth's distance from others, her inherent suspiciousness, her victimization and how she can respond to that with violence, her unique skills. . . . And also her humanity, as she interacts with her former overseer, felled by a stroke.<br /><br />Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced investigative reporter. He does a good turn as this character, although I mildly prefer the Swedish variant on Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist). Craig, however, does nicely in this role.<br /><br />The other characters also work well on screen in this version.<br /><br />The plot is simple: Blomkvist is disgraced when a story he writes on a gazillionaire rogue financier turns out to be false (he was set up). He ends up agreeing to work for retired industrialist Henrik Vanger, still obsessed with the apparent murder of Harriet Vanger when she was just a teenager, many decades earlier. Salander is the investigator vetting Blomkvist for Vanger.<br /><br />Blomkvist accepts the job, finally. Halfway through the movie, he meets Salander. And, in many ways, this is when the movie hits its stride. Their relationship develops in unexpected ways. They work toward solving a string of murders apparently related to Harriet.<br /><br />The mystery as to the murderer--and the revelation of the fate of Harriet--are addressed nicely.<br /><br />This version follows the book more closely than the Swedish version. Salander's stealth attack on the rogue financier is played out nicely (it is only hinted at in the earlier version). The ending is most poignant, and much closer to the book than the Swedish version. Director Peter Fincher's vision works well. The cinematography is better than the Swedish version (although making that statement is almost like comparing apples and oranges, since the productions are different).<br /><br />In the end, I like both versions. But this version holds up quite nicely, and my original suspicions about a commercial sellout were allayed.ationship develops in unexpected ways.

B0059XTUMC|4.0|THE ARTIST is a silent movie with an up-front music score. The composer has a huge credit line in the opening credits, and the music serves as an almost nonstop accompaniment to the movie. Watching this picture is rather like watching an extended music video. The great visual appeal of the movie is in its two French stars, who beautifully evoke the glamor of early Hollywood, and who even learned how to tap dance for a few dancing scenes. I'd have been happier with more dancing in the movie, but what there is of it is divine. And then there's a dog whose barking remains silent, but whose character shines.   For movie music fans, THE ARTIST may seem to derail itself when the original score gives way to Bernard Herrmann's music underscoring the climactic love scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 masterpiece, VERTIGO. That music has some thematic relevance to the climax of THE ARTIST, but sounds so different from the movie's original score--and so anachronistic in a movie set in the late 1920s-early 1930s--that I couldn't enjoy the resolution of the story as much as I wanted to. At least I'd been forewarned about this oddity in THE ARTIST, so I wasn't surprised by it and was interested to see how it worked in this picture. But it didn't work very well for me.  That said, I'll probably see this movie more than once again because it's such a musical and visual treat. I recommend watching it with Alfred Hitchcock's 1929 silent-talkie hybrid, BLACKMAIL. The Hitchcock picture is mostly a talkie, and THE ARTIST is mostly silent, but it, too, is a hybrid.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Don't know why it is so fun but it is. For some reason it is fun to knock over buildings with birds.

1439102813|4.0|This is a sad story. You are prepared going in, but, still, it's a tough read.<br /><br />Alice is a Harvard professor who studies the brain. She begins to notice that she is forgetting things. The pattern continues and grows bolder, and Alice is forced to seek help.<br /><br />What she feared most is true: She has early-onset Altzheimer's.<br /><br />Reading the story from Alice's point of view is difficult. She grows less and less aware of things and more and more estranged from her world.<br /><br />Very sad story.
1250004349|5.0|This book was well written and gave me a true sense of what was happening at the time.  The characters are believable, and the sad story is gripping.  I loved the book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this app is super cool. I cant get enough of these angry birds. this is my favorote app. so werth wile

B003HARV3Y|2.0|Movie was a disappointment after reading the book.  The clever humor was lost. Acting was uninspiring.  The story line deviatinos from the book were disappointing.  I got bored partway through and was tempted to stop.  Reading the book again is a better use of time.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this game is fun but there is a downer to this it is amolst the same as ninja fruit slice only with different tiltes
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. This show is very, very good. Just finished season 2. This show ranks among my top5 T.V. shows of all time.
031603441X|5.0|But, I have enjoyed your music since I was young and still do.  After reading your book you shared the reality and work of what it takes to be a rock star.  You are the bomb Keith.  Thanks for sharing your Life with me, an averge person who loves good music.  I had bangers and mashers for the first time at the Hungry Toad, Boulder, Co after finising your book. They were delicious.  Enjoy the rest of your Life and Happy New Year 2012.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a phenominal application that is even better than the computer version. it offers one or three deal decks. with a wide selection of card backgrounds. it has one touch movement and a help button that will assist you if u are having any trouble. the best part is that its free! I highly recommend this app and think everyone should have it.
0385534639|4.0|This book really is as good as many other reviewers offer.  It has the maturity level of a late Harry Potter, and it just as vividly recreates imaginary worlds that keep you turning through pages and hoping for more.  Very well done here.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Everyone knows what the show itself is about, so I won't bore you. All I can say is that the bluray set has excellent PQ and AQ. Plus the actual case and set looks amazing. The set itself, is the best movie or tv show set that I have ever owned. It's great to look at and has so many extras......Flawless!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app works great on my kindle fire. best solitaire game ever. I like the hint feature and the auto complete feature. I also like the little card shuffling sounds.
B0063IH60K|5.0|really good for the mind Play it all of the time. reccommend down loading this fun card game to play
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is one of the best games ever, its like WOW.<br />Graphics our good, story is ok, and 100's of hours of game play.
B0063IH60K|4.0|its fun. the app is quick to load and play. there are also different settings to allow you to play your favorite version of solitaire.
B001563I5C|1.0|This bluray is only for UK/Europe region. It doesn't work in my NTSC PS3. It's PAL format, and region coded to UK.  Not only that but the shrink wrap was very loose, as if it was not done professionally but by an individual.  Also, there seems to be no markings on the inside 'ring' of the bluray, which leads me to believe it might be a bootleg as well. I'm not aware if bootlegged blurays exist yet, but it's probably possible.  That's the last time I buy a bluray under $10.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|This product does not work as suggested.  The \\"stand\\" is quite flimsy and is not strong enough to support the Kindle unless it is sitting on a hard, sturdy surface.  Also, it was advertised for vertical and horizontal use but the stand is way to flimsy to provide vertical support at a readable angle.  I am usually hesitant to give a poor review but in this case, I have to.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game really shines on the Kindle Fire. Great graphics and soundtrack make this app a wonderful experience. Highly recommend!
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this app!  I haven't played it in years and its addictive.  I tend to get obsessive about beating my last score.  Great free app.
1451648537|5.0|Many reviews give the book 1 or 2-Stars, stating that Steve Jobs was impossible to like and treated other people like dirt.  That may be true but, instead of giving the book a bad review because of Jobs' personality, they should give the book 5-Stars because the author, Isaacson, was able to do such a great job of telling us exactly who and what Jobs was.  My take is just the opposite.  This biography (and I normally hate biographies because they are boring) is the most fascinating book I have read in years.  Isaacson has done a masterful job of revealing not only Jobs' abrasive personality, but also his legacy of dramatically changing how we live our lives.  Jobs was a genius and a visionary who transformed seven industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, digital publishing, and retail stores. According to Isaacson, Jobs also \\"created what became the most valuable company on earth, one that stood at the intersection of the humanities and technology, and is the company most likely still to be doing that a generation from now. His legacy, as he said in his \\"Think Different\\" ad, was reminding us that the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.\\"  Jobs was an absolute genius and all of us should be forever grateful for all the great things he created. Steve Jobs really cared deeply about his products. He had an intuitive feel for what the consumer wanted. He truly wanted his products, and even their packaging, to be close to art. Although very few in the industry believed his approach was the right path to take, he continued to hold on to this belief. Each button, CD tray, color, and line was important to him. There's a great passage in the book when he found out that his engineers had made the CD-ROM drive of a Mac a tray instead a slot. It literally brought him to tears.      I have always been a user of Apple products and now I understand why.  Whether it's an iMac, an iPod, an iPhone,or an iPad, they all work so seamlessly with each other and with the software that was created for them.  Why?  Because Steve Jobs insisted on perfection.    Thank you Walter Isaacson for helping us appreciate the incredible talent of Steve Jobs. And thank you, Steve Jobs, for changing our world and making it so much more fun.
B0050XFY4O|4.0|This movie was absolutely beautiful... a wonderful masterpiece that was acted, directed, and filmed well. Though I felt that they spent too much time in their childhood, I feel that the viewer really received a clear picture of the love the two brothers shared.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a truly genuine love story, though it is highly incestuous.
0439813786|5.0|My daughter(9yrs. old) loved the story and the subsequent film. The book is filled with illustrations and it's just an awesome addition to your child's library. It also makes for a nice read together before bedtime as the chapters are not too long and are broken up with sketches that transport you to Hugo's world very nicely.  Highly reccomend!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I grabbed it because it was free through the Amazon Lending Library and I wanted to check it out.  It was a very quick read.  It was well written, and easy to get into.  Overall though, I wasn't a huge fan.  I had already read \\"Battle Royale\\" in the last year or two, so the premise was very familiar to me, but I thought Battle Royale did it better.  Furthermore, the juxtaposition of the whole teenage girl love story within the violence of the game just didn't strike a chord with me. (Maybe because I'm a guy)  I understand its a very popular book, and I can certainly see why, but it just wasn't for me.  I'd recommend \\"Battle Royale\\" over this book if the premise of the battle intrigues you more than the love story angle.
B0024CEY36|4.0|Ken Follett is a a prolific writer--not as prolific as James Patterson, but pretty close.  Although prolific, Follett does not miss details or historical minutia.  In this book, the Earl of Walden is convinced by Winston Churchill and King George to broker an alliance with Russia in 1914.  Germany is creating swords out of plowshares and war appears eminent.  It is crucial that Russia align itself with England.<br /><br />The Earl of Walden's wife is from Russian aristocracy and her past is linked with a Russian anarchist.  How this impacts her, her husband and daughter ties closely into this drama.<br /><br />I liked this book and the dynamics between the characters.  Follett's style of writing is delicious to read and creates clear visions of each scene and character.<br /><br />One thing that I was not \\"hip\\" on was the women's suffragette movement being intwined in this book.  I understand why Follett put in the book to help connect the characters together at crucial points but this movement took away from the bigger issue of impending WWI.
0937381888|5.0|I brewed many years ago and produced dishwater as often as I made something that was close to drinkable.  Now, having started to brew once more, I read Palmer's book.  It is laid out just for me: Chapter 1 was for the impatient brewer helping me produce something far superior to those college-day brews.  And then the rest of the book helped me understand the many variable in brewing and took me from extract to using some grains.  I was referencing the on-line book so often that I decided to buy it.  The print version contains even more information.  A must have for first time brewers... and I expect that I will be referencing it often now that I have got the brewing bug once more.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Next installment on the incredible \\"Les Miserables\\" phenomena--new and old voices added together to sing the songs from the theater production.  It is great--even though it is hard for me to see Cosette as a blonde and Eponine as a brunnette.
B005CIWNJG|1.0|Love your books James Rollins and have been a big fan for years but you really need to give your publishers a reality check.  We Australian fans are not the cash cows your publisher seems to think we are. $20 + for an e-book and trying to pass the extra cost off as a tax (to my knowledge any overseas purchase under $1000 does not attract a tax) is outragous!  One very unhappy Australian fan. By the way publisher, this price will not push me to buy the paperback/hardcover version. It will result in a boycott of all books (e-books or otherwise) published by you!
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I am an 11 year old girl, when I read tbis serries I fell in love. Paolini has a daring and vivid imagination, there are tons of great datails in this book!!! Although I do not think that Oromis should have died and when Arya yold Eragon her lifes story I did squirm a little bit. All in all this was an awesome book ( and series) I did not think there was too much blood and goor and i didn't find the book disturbing and never had any nightmares ( althohgh the dwarf politics were mind numbing and extremely dull/tiresome).
B005KELQEU|3.0|This is just a sleeve to protect the Kindle. It seems fairly well made and looks good but it is way too small. With my Kindle touch in its rubber skin I can barely get it zipped with a great deal of effort. Even with it out of the sleeve it still seems snug enough that the seams seem to stretch.
B0061JPYX2|2.0|This review will be consistent with my review for \\"Back to Black\\" which I said that she ripped the 60's Motown sound and called it all her own, because she did not credit anyone but herself.  Her supporters act as if her sound is original; however, she told the truth when she said \\"Back to Black\\" no matter how she attempted to disguise the true meaning with her lyrics that she somehow goes blank in regard to that relationship.  The title was just her insurance policy for people like me who would accuse her of theft, very convenient.  That being said, I was sorry to hear of her passing so young with so much life ahead of her but in some ways I think her addiction was guilt driven; afterall, she knew her style and material was not original.  But, if Beyonce did that she would be accused of stealing. Prime example,  the video for Countdown. But you know when you perform and sing as well as, Beyonce does, envy is always the rule of the day.
B005I6EU48|4.0|This is a beautiful cover that I receive complements on almost daily. The case came along with my Fire and like the reviews before, I did notice the case seemed a bit too small and the cover didn't lay flat. I wanted to give this a try however, hoping that the case could be \\"broken in\\" over time. Thankfully I did. The case fits perfectly now and hasn't given me a problem since that first day. It's fairly heavy duty and does its job protecting the Fire as well as look stunning.
B005R5U5B2|5.0|This CD is amazing, it was completely worth it, and I am glad I got it. It was one of my presents for this holiday season and worth every penny. (: It came on time and in brand new condition. This was my first time ordering off of amazon and I plan on doing it again. Buy this album, if you love One Direction or simply just thier music. The songs are great especially for the first album, cant wait to hear new music from One Direction.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I had originally watched this in language lab for university--I wasn't sure what to expect, and to be honest, the description doesn't do the movie justice. I grab the movie because it was long and I needed to get my hours in and I sit down at a computer in the crowded lab. The people around me must have thought I had lost my mind. One moment I'm trying my best not to laugh hysterically, the next I'm doing everything in my power to keep from balling my eyes out.   This movie was undoubtedly one of the best I have seen. This will take your heart, evoking emotion after emotion and throwing it all together into a beautiful masterpiece. The best way to describe this, would be to say it celebrates life. I would recommend this to anyone and encourage everyone to watch it.
B005HSL626|5.0|really great game for free!! I love the upgrades of the cool backrounds and blades! it may not be an adventurous quest game but it sure is entertaining!!
B005QBKXOQ|4.0|The CD is very typical Daughtry so if you like him, you'll like it.  I am always drawn to his lyrics!
1118026470|5.0|Whether you're a web developer, security professional, or hacker, this is a book that you need to read. I'm sure I'll be referencing the WAHH for years to come. Worth every penny.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|As a rule, I loathe spinoffs of Pride and Prejudice, perhaps my most favorite novel of all.  I bought this book only because it was written by P.D. James, and, while I did not expect to find Austen, I did expect to find P.D. James' usual level of characterization and plotting.  I didn't get it.  Instead, I got pretty much what all the would-be Austens deliver:  weak characters, weak plot, and way too much re-statement of material from Pride and Prejudice.  I've read Pride and Prejudice (many times).  I did not need to read half of it again, rehashed, in this book.  The mystery here isn't much, and no one solves it; instead, we get a deus ex machina revelation.  I read the whole book, and I'm not actually sorry I spent the time, but I am sorry that James couldn't come up with anything significantly better than the average P&P sequel.  I expected more.  Wait for the library copy.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|best note file app period. kindle app is flawless as far as I can tell. easy search and sync. best of all free.
1451627289|3.0|I had such high hopes for this novel which combines two of my favorite topics - time travel and JFK.  However, as other middle-of-the-road reviews noted the opening grabs you, the ending is way too short and the middle of the book drags on with a love interest and character development that doesn't really hold the reader nor contribute to moving the story forward.  As a side note to JFK historical junkies, King relies on the \\"lone gunman\\" theory in order to make his book work.  I thought he did this for merely practical reasons (thwarting a complex conspiracy theory would double the length of an already very long book), however in the afterward King goes on to say how utterly convinced he is that Oswald acted alone (and quotes some texts which I intend to read).  However to me (and I thought the general public), this theory is preposterous and I would point any interested reader to \\"JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters\\" for an extraordinary argument to the contrary.
B003QCCS36|5.0|R. L. scores with this CD!  The steel pedal fits in well with his voice. On his other cd's he sounded like a hoarse choir boy. With the addition of great pedal steel, ( some of the prettiest I've heard in a long time), R.L. belts it out boldly. I think this would rank quite well with some of the 70's great country/rock albums. Poco, Flying Burrito Brothers,  etc.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app it makes staying in the word daily easy. Way more than I would have expected from a free app.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Wonderful app with a wide variety of tools to keep little kids busy. There are tons of colors of markers, paint, colored pencils, stamps, backgrounds and stickers. Easy to use.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I am a bit confused by the customer reviews regarding the SB-900 AF Speedlight Flash overheating.  I am using it on the Nikon D-700 and it has taken my photography to the next level.  I shoot like a professional!  Previously, I was one who preferred shooting without a flash; however, now I am blown away by how crisp and clear the images are (this without any post editing).  I generally shoot with the flash pointing straight up (to the ceiling)...it fills the room/outdoors with ambient flash.  Advice to all photography enthusiasts....get the SB-900....no need to thank me, just enjoy the results.  P.S.  Incredibly, this sat in my camera bag for a while before I began using it; go figure.  TIP:  Works great with the rechargeable \\"Eneloop\\" batteries/Sanyo Ni-MH Battery Charger - have not experienced any overheating problems.
B004LWZW4W|4.0|I watched this last night for the first time having not seen it in theaters.  Along for the ride were two visiting Canadians who had not seen any of the older or newer Apes movies.  Rise of the Planet of the Apes does fulfill its promise to explain the beginning of the Apes growing intelligence.  It stops where this embryonic tribe of apes moves into the forest and therefore, does not venture to how they became the dominant species over humans.  There is only a hint that the meds given to the apes is fatal to humans when breathed in.  Other than that foreshadowing, a new movie would have to show how the apes became dominant and humans reduced to slavery and living in the wild.<br />After watching, it became my believe that for the two visitors who were not familiar with the Planet of the Apes mythology, it would have been better for them to have seen either the original Charlton Heston movie or the more recent remake with Mark Walhberg.<br />That said, for me, the movie is capable of standing upon its own legs as a separate entity.  The video quality of the blu ray is very good tho I would not say outstanding but I could detect no artifacting and deep blacks were prominent.  The DTS audio was a bit disappointing for me as, with such an action movie, more use of the surrounds could have been improved even though the levels were just fine.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B00280LYHS|5.0|From the beginning Percy and his frriends are thrown into daanger. Yep, Percy was right- there are monsters evrywhere when youre halfblood.  The  fast pace of this book - and Riordans writing style - makes you jump at evry turn. A monster gets killed and then another comes! What's next?  Another thing about ariodans style. Everthing is so fun, modern and easy to understand. It feels like the words are a river and you are just another perso  going o a float. Ya know when you drive a little ways from camp jump in the water and float back? This is what it feels likee to read Riodans awesome books.  And funny! Ah the humor. I love how we see the storhy from Percys view nbut the other chracters are as real and alive as Percy. Jokes and normal behavior is thrown in. Not justt a commando group lf kids goingg to sve the world cuz theyre told to. A group of brave, real, believable and loveable frriends who go to save the world becauuse they live i  it! They hav deelings. They care. Percy And his friends are someof the collest most eealistic heroes ever.  Ive read this book around 10 times and I usually cant even read a book 2 times!!!! Thats pretty amazing. All in all Id eeaccommend this to someone who wants to leave reealisty but stay with it- and anyone who wants a great read.  ps sorry for typos.
6305910340|5.0|I agree with another reviewer's criteria for purchasing a movie and that is the quantity of times I believe I'll watch and re-watch a movie.  SFBF remains one of my top five and I cheer and laugh and cry each time. ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT over chess and the human drama!  The acting by all players - ESPECIALLY young Max Pomeranc as Josh Waitzkin is astounding and real and so easily flowing and allowed.  A testament to direction and the adult actors around him... who also turn in sterling, memorable performances.  Actually, it all doesn't even look or feel like \\"performances!\\"  I have a VHS version of the movie and am astonished at the advertised prices of the dvd's.  Don't know what's going on there!  I guess I'll just have to get mine copied onto dvd's.

B005CW4U2K|1.0|The dvd will play for 20 minutes and nothing else. Gave to son for christmas present and he lives 3 hrs away.
B005FUTBWS|4.0|But I'm glad I watched it. It's tense, it's creepy, and worst yet...it's possible. Lots of whoa, did that just happen? bits, and I certainly didn't see the end coming the way it did. Well done.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game!! Great version and always fun. No device should be without a good solitaire game and this one is great.
B005NGKMOU|3.0|Eh. Had high hopes for this due to the viewer ratings and the fact that I love a good western. BUT...maybe it's me but they mumble a lot. And my spanish isn't good enough to keep up with what they were saying. The scenery was awesome, the premise was good, the acting a little sludgy.

B0016BWACI|5.0|I was happy with the product i received. It arrived on time and the DVD played with no errors. My family enjoyed the product and knows what cite to visit for future purchases.
031617615X|5.0|After reading some other reviews, I am shocked! This is absolutely, positively my favorite book. Not just my favorite book of the series, my favorite book of all time. I read all sorts of books, classics, mysteries, book club type books, and so on. This is the only series that I have wanted to read more than once - and have read the whole series at least 3 times. Several times I have tried to pinpoint what it is that draws me back in each time & I find it impossible. I find this book to be the best for a couple reasons - I cheer for Bella as she finally finds a place where she fits in the world, I cheer for Jacob as it all finally fits together for him, and I find all the new characters so very engaging. Best of all, this gives a happy ending - and doesn't everyone want a happy ending to their story?

B001V7R09A|5.0|Old and lucky enough to have seen great pianists playing in concert halls since 1946--Horowitz and Rubinstein, Myra Hess and Lipatti, Arrau and Gieseking, Serkin and Sandor, Michelangeli, Clara Haskil, Gilels and Richter--the question of virtuosity vs. \\"heart\\" is, for me, too big to ignore.  Richter--seen only once, in his last recital in Freiburg (which was repeated in Munich, shortly before he died), is the most astonishing pianist I've known.  Every moment in this collection, PIANIST OF THE CENTURY, has his essential verve, a daring most pianists would not dare.  Perhaps it's Richter's training in and devotion to the Opera that determines such energy, such big-heartedness.  No matter.  The loud climaxes ring and sing.  The softer-than-soft asides are, in a word, radiant.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|Initially disappointed by the absence of Jon Anderson, I succumbed to the lyrics and music style of this new album of the group. Yes, the group is back after 10 years of not producing new music. The fans of the group's old style may not like this new album, but if you are away of the disputes will enjoy the music as much as I do each time I listen the album. Welcome back.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I have been waiting for this for a while! Awesome game, easy to understand, yet challenging! amazon kindle fire rocks too!
B003K16P3M|4.0|I do enjoy me a good young adult fantasy book, and this one did not disappoint.  (For demographic purposes, I'm a 31 yo female, avid reader, and I generally gravitate towards paranormal romance garbage, with some action sci-fi and YA fiction thrown in for good measure.)  I agree with other readers that there are some more mature subject matters - murder, maiming, sex, etc, but there is nothing very graphic, other than one death scene.  The protagonists are of an indeterminate age, between 17-20ish.  The book was fast-paced and engaging, lots of action.  I couldn't set it down and spent a good portion of my work day reading.  ;)  The ending was rather abrupt, however, and left something to be desired - like a sequel? - and I feel the characters were just a tiny bit flat, hence the 4 stars.  I would definitely recommend to any teen/tweener old enough to grapple with the more mature topics, and adults will enjoy it as well!  On a side note, I read the Kindle version and found only a few very minor typos, the formatting was very clean.  Enjoy!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Definitely recommend! Best season ever, period. Great stories and cast, like the how Emily's past is gradually revealed till the episode where she was \\"killed\\". Can't wait for her to be back!
030788743X|5.0|This is the best book I've read since Lev Grossman's \\"The Magician's\\", which is actually somewhat similar in it's plot: A teenage boy of above average intelligence is given a chance to become something greater than he is, if he works hard at it.  That type of plot is the basis for many, many other novels, but these two rise about the sterotype.
055357342X|5.0|So I am now on the fourth book, and wanted to talk about the third book. I think the thing I love about this series is that you never know which way things are gonna turn. EVER!!! Its like a rollercoaster ride with no track. The characters a book ago I hated, I can understand a bit better, the ones I loved are showing different sides and makes me not so fond of them. Just like us real humans we make decisions and have to live with them, good or bad. The only bad thing about this series is that I find myself glossing over stuff now, to get to certain characters and what not. My ADD not the authors fault. Well I will just have to reread them and go slower. If you want to get deeply involved with a book, say like Harry Potters characters or some of Stephen Kings yarns, well this will not disappoint. Definetly not a kids book though. Thanks
B004FOA84A|5.0|This is my favorite Kindle app!  Definitely worth the dollar!  filled with mystery and suspense, this game will have you anxious for more!<br />  Amazing performance!
B005QBKXOQ|4.0|Love Daughtry and pretty much love anything they sing. This album is good, I listened to it about 6 times back and forth in a 19 hour car trip for the holidays. I don't feel the need to skip any songs, I like them all, some more than others, but I didn't hate any of them.  I feel like this album, they really poured their hearts out and it felt more personal than their other 2 albums.  There isn't a huge variation between every song, but none of them sound the same either. If you are a true fan, I think you will enjoy this album. Way to go guys!!!!!!!!!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Do not hesitate to buy this. It's absolutely fantastic. The only problem is that it's a \\"weekend killer\\" as my husband says, because you get so into it that you do nothing else the entire weekend.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|My husband and I both love Kelly Clarkson, we own 3 of her Cds. This one may be my favorite!  My absoulte favorite song on it is #2 (Stronger) I keep hitting replay over and over again, love it!  There are probably 2 songs I just don't like at all and skip every time, but I love just popping it in the car and listening to it. We listened to this album 6-8 times over a 4 day car trip back and forth for the holidays and I have to say, I never got sick of it.  Way to go Kelly! :)
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Highly recommend!! More app then expected, money well spent. Can do endless hours and so many possibilities. I feel like a kid in a candy store...lol
B004EPYZUS|4.0|I honestly didn't know which number sequel this was before watching the 2011 entry into the franchise. In fact, I had only seen the original 1996 [[ASIN:B0018RFLN0 Mission: Impossible]] prior to this viewing and heard rumors that the two previous sequels in 2000 and 2006 were simply retreads of the first movie, which was in itself a reimagining of the popular 1960's TV series, granted an extravagant, multi-million-dollar reimagining directed by Brian DePalma. This one showcases an older yet still agile Tom Cruise returning to the role of intrepid IMF agent Ethan Hunt, and even as he closes in on fifty, he demonstrates the same unparalleled commitment to dangerous, high-flying derring-do he displayed in the first one fifteen years ago. This time, the reins have been handed over to Brad Bird who makes his live-action directorial debut after scoring with a couple of Pixar's megahits, [[ASIN:B00005JN4W The Incredibles]] and [[ASIN:B000VBJEEG Ratatouille]]. The results are fortuitous because Bird brings great visual flair to a film that demands gasp-worthy action sequences.<br /><br />In fact, the action is so propulsive that the convoluted plot takes a decided backseat. Written by Andr&eacute; Nemec and Josh Appelbaum, the story feels like a throwback to the days of Soviet spy-versus-spy intrigue and A-bomb secrets. This time, it all revolves around a briefcase with Russian launch codes that are prized by a brilliant Russian madman named Kurt Hendricks, code name Cobalt, who wants nothing less than using them to destroy the world. He is so feared that Hunt has to be sprung from a Russian prison where it is unclear why he is incarcerated until the very end of the film. A small IMF team has been assigned the duty, consisting of sultry but tough Jane Carter, tech wizard Benji Dunn, and unexpectedly, the IMF Secretary's chief analyst William Brandt. They need to track down a French assassin for hire who has already killed one of their own in cold blood for the briefcase. The team ends up in the Kremlin where their plans go fatally awry. The CIA points the finger at the IMF team for the disaster and invokes the dreaded Ghost Protocol.<br /><br />The now-rogue agents make their way to the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, where Hunt has to scale the outside of the building to manipulate the building's computer system. A botched transaction with the assassin leads to mayhem and then a final stop in Mumbai where there is the inevitable race against the clock to save the world. The movie is really all about the set pieces - the Russian prison escape, the Kremlin break-in and explosion (an excellent special effect), Hunt's gravity-defying climb in Dubai and an overwhelming sandstorm, and the movable multi-level parking lot in Mumbai which sets that stage for the final showdown. Performance are secondary in this kind of movie, but they are mostly workmanlike. Cruise is inarguably in his element as an action hero, and he appears to perform most of his death-defying stunts.  Jeremy Renner ([[ASIN:B00275EGWY The Hurt Locker]]) also shows the necessary chops as the initially mysterious Brandt, and it is clear he will be playing a larger role in the next installment.<br /><br />Paula Patton, a long way from the inspirational teacher she played in [[ASIN:B002VECM4A Precious]], brings the requisite sexy strength to Carter, in particular, in a no-holds-barred fight scene with the assassin played by L&eacute;a Seydoux (whom I was surprised to discover is the same actress who played the shy antiques dealer in [[ASIN:B005MYEQ4U Midnight in Paris]]). Simon Pegg ([[ASIN:B000RJO578 Hot Fuzz]]) initially tries too hard for laughs as Dunn until he finally settles into the film's more tongue-in-cheek tone. Michael Nyqvist only has to convey relentless menace as Hendricks, which he does just fine. Anil Kapoor ([[ASIN:B001P9KR8U Slumdog Millionaire]]) shows up as a wealthy Indian tycoon, as does Tom Wilkinson quite briefly as the IMF Secretary. The actor who plays the Russian intelligence operative, Vladimir Mashkov, bears such a striking resemblance to SNL's Fred Armisen that for the longest time, I thought it was Armisen in an impressive change-of-pace. Veteran cinematographer Robert Elswit ([[ASIN:B0013FXWU6 There Will Be Blood]]) does excellent camerawork in the various locales - Budapest, Moscow, Dubai and Mumbai. Fans of the franchise shouldn't be disappointed.igence operative, Vladimir Mashkov, bears such a striking resemblance to SNL's Fred Armisen that for the longest time, I thought it was Armisen in an impressive change-of-pace.

B005D0RDIE|3.0|I own all Rush DVDs.: RIO, R30,Rush3X,Snakes & Arrows and now Time Machine.<br />I am frankly a little disapointed. I am 47 years old, I have been listening to Rush since I am 10 years old,(I have two older brothers who were in their teens when Rush's debut album came out). I still think that RUSH is the best Rock band ever.<br /><br />This DVD disapoints me. The venue is less attractive, The cinematography and editing seems to have been done without any real heart into it. The songs rush through with what seems to me like haste. At one point Alex nods to Neil that they are half way. Like they can't wait for the concert to finish! Rush seems less professional. To me the best Rush Concert on DVD is still the Snakes & Arrows one. There they seem more in top form.

B005HI7NP0|5.0|Oh my goodness gracious!  I have spent the last week listening (and listening and listening) to \\"Betty Wright--the Movie\\".  This is clearly my best record of the year, if not the best of the last decade.  I even made my wife and son listen to it during Christmas Eve dinner.  Wright's best known hits are \\"Clean up Woman\\" (1972), \\"Tonight is the Night\\" 1978, and many more. She has not record a solo album in a decade, but has worked with many contemporary artists such as Erykah Badu, Joss Stone and Li'l Wayne in song writing, backing vocals and production  Wright collaborates with (and is backed up by) the hip-hop impresarios, The Roots.  The Roots' playing is clean and honest and true to Betty Wright's voice and vision.  Wright co-wrote and co-produced all the material on the record.  Neo soul artists should put down their poses and take a lesson from Ms. Wright.  This is what Soul music is all about.  Buy this record.  Now.
B005HYNCTK|5.0|Having loved Bruckner for over 40 years, these performances are like no other ones, including C's earlier ones, which are taken at more standard speeds. But there are things here that -- if you, say, like the way Furtwangler played the adagio of Beethoven's Ninth or Richter played the first movement of the B Flat Schubert sonata --<br />will transport you to another way of listening to Bruckner. The two keys are clarity and color. First, many passages that are lost in faster readings become clear here, for instance the harps in No. 8 or the way things tail off quietly after a climax.  Second, C. colors the orchestra in so many ways that what is repetitious elsewhere<br />is not here. Knappertsbusch conducted this orchestra previously, and I can only think he would have conducted Bruckner like this is he had the nerve.  If Bruckner actually wanted his music performed this way, then he is like no other composer -- the cosmic greatness one hears from Furtwangler is magnified in a way that can only be experienced and not really described.  For instance, taking no.s 7 and 8 -- the climaxes at the end of the final movements are the climaxes of the symphony - in almost all other performances, everything after the great slow movement climaxes seem afterthoughts, puzzles, or incoherent.  I only wish he had performed the almost finished final movement of the Ninth.  But if you lack patience, or want more momentum, or music that sounds more like music<br />other composers wrote, there are many fine editions.  But for $35 or so, why not take a chance on what could be<br />the most amazing experience in a lifetime of listening to music?

B0052GACNM|4.0|Duets II    Tony Bennett's work on Duets II with the verious artists was truly fantistic.  All of the songs were grate without exception.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|I love a fun, well done sci-fi movie with lots of suspense and Rise of the Planet of the Apes had it in droves!  Being a pretty loyal fan of the original Planet of the Apes series of movies, I wasn't quite sure how I was going to like this one, but the majority of the film was put together nicely.  The CGI was a bit off, I thought, and the final 2-3 minutes of the film were slightly hokey, but the action, suspense, and moral underpinnings of the story made up for it.  I was also pretty happy that this movie was not overly grotesque or gory.<br /><br />Very well done and lots of fun!  My eyes were glued to this film and the action/suspense had me covering my mouth and practically jumping out of my seat.  I haven't had a movie experience like that in a while.<br /><br />*Please watch a few minutes into the credits as there is a small (depending on how you look at it - lol) surprise waiting for you. (wink)

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I received a Kindle Fire for Christmas from my husband and he purchased this case for me.  Initially I was a little leery about using it because I thought I was going to accidentally rip the cover \\"flap\\" off since it is so thin and flimsy.  I was quite surprised to see how durable the case it.  I love how lightweight it is and how the material is so smooth. I love that there is an elastic strap that I can put over the flap to keep it from unexpectedly opening.  My only concern with the elastic strap is its lifespan.  While I haven't really experienced any problems with it myself nor have I read any bad reviews about the strap I wonder if the elasticity will begin to wear overtime therefore causing it to stretch and never retract to its original tightness.  Nonetheless, even if that did happen to me I would not hesitate to buy this case again.<br /><br />Pros:  Decent price, very durable, good protection from damage (Yep, I've dropped my Fire already lol.  But that's not to say this case would protect every instance obviously),  very lightweight, fits Kindle Fire snugly so that it doesn't make the unit appear bigger than it actually it (That is a HUGE bonus in my opinion as I prefer the small size of the Fire over normal tablet size.  I hate when cases make products bulkier), Smooth material that is easy on the hands when holding it for long periods of time.<br /><br />Cons:  Reading a previous comment, I too also noticed that there are rather rigid edges around the corners that cause little scratches on my fingers here and there.  But nothing to make me say \\"ouch\\" over.  They just seem to need a little buffing down.  My last and final gripe is that I wish there was some sort of lip on the back of the case so that when you are using the case to sit the Kindle upright it won't fall down as easy.  They just need a 1 inch lip that is just big enough for the flap of the case to slide behind so that if it is sitting on a table and you bump it it won't give way and just fall flat.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This is one of the best series, I love the acting, the costumes and most of the history is accurate, it's very entertainting!
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I saw this in the theaters and almost walked out.  For a movie that was supposed to be about a driver there was very limited car scenes and the acting was awful at best.  Do not waste your money on this pile that is called a movie.  Run, wait \\"Drive\\" away from this horrible movie as fast as you can!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire has been a great card game that have helped us all pass the idle hours away and it does not disappoint as a great app on my galaxy tab.  It gives you a choice of deals between a winning deal and a random one and the game is fun and challenging, no matter which one you choose.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|After searching through all the covers for the Kindle Fire I had bought, I finally settled on this one. At first, the time table was two-three weeks for receipt, but I soon got an email that the product had shipped and would be there only two days after my Fire purchase!   This cover is all I wanted it to be. Soft, silicone type (like most all cell phone covers these days). The 'back' piece, I would call it, is the one that contains the color you order - this is the piece that the Kindle snaps into place inside. There is a black felt-type cover for the front that either folds back on top of the silicone portion, or comes forward to protect the screen and is held in place with an elastic strap. The felt-cover also fold back on itself to fit in a molded dip/dent in the back of the silicone cover so that it can stand up on its own - this ONLY works when the Fire is in it, as it requires the weight to make the stand rigid (I wish I could explain this better).   I chose the pink one, as that is the color I liked best. One month plus of owning and using (pretty much non-stop) and I have had no problems at all with the cover or the Kindle Fire contained within.
B005MF1O5S|4.0|The sci-fi fans may not like this episode because it's low on the whiz-bang, but I thought it was a beautiful story about love, sacrifice, and patience.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great product, I found it to have plenty of room for all my equipment.  It is also well built and I like the size of it.  I would definitely recommend it to others.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It works great on the kindle fire.  Its more fun than on the computer.  A free game to boot.  Keep up the good job!
0061733199|5.0|I wouldn't know if the book is any good myself. My kids liked the book a lot though, so I guess it's good.....My Idea of roughing it is no room service, so....
B0035V35P8|5.0|this movie is so freakin' cool!  great action, a good enough story for an action movie, and some awesome goofy-gore.  i have watched this probably a half-dozen times, and I just don't get sick of it!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Personally, I received this case from Amazon today, and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of this product. This cover is extremely lightweight and it's a perfect fit for the Kindle Fire. Some may question it's ability to protect, but compared to several of the other models I viewed in stores and on Amazon, this cover won me over!!!
B0056BU3I2|5.0|If you like the other \\"fast and furious\\" flicks this one won't dissapoint. Start to finish it has action and edge of your seat suspense. Some of the old characters are back with some new alliances so spend the money and enjoy!
0679847367|5.0|This will be a gift to each of my boys upon graduation...haven't decided high school or college.  Anyway, I started in pre-school, at the end of each year I write a little something about that child and how I saw him grow and develop.  The book will not be \\"revealed\\" until the graduation I choose (again, still haven't decided how to go on that one).  I will give this as a keepsake gift.  I have one for each child.  The story is the same no matter which edition, but the slipcover makes it extra special.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|Classic Scary Movie. Reasonably priced and in HD. Can't go wrong; if you want to relive this classic get this blu ray.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this book at the recommendation of my roommate, and the fact the movie is coming out, and found myself completely immersed in the story and the characters.  Ms. Collins beautifully crafted the two protagonists and their support team, as well as made you feel for a few of the other Tributes.  The world created by Ms Collins is an example of the darker parts of human nature, and the effect they have on people coming into the world.  I definitely recommend this book.
B005K17RU0|4.0|A nice simple weather app. Does what it should and works well. Easy to add new cities and setup. A very good free weather app.

B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy this game because it is always challenging and entertaining.  I would definately reccomend it for someone that enjoys a challenge.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I purchased this because I did not want some cheaply made nylon cover that looks like every other cover for every other device. The Verso Prologue Cover is classy, well made and functional. It fits my Kindle Fire perfectly. Everything about this cover is well above standard. Overall craftsmanship is excellent,from the stitching to the embossed front and gold accents. The color is very elegant in an Old World way. Shipping was very fast as well. Overall I could not be happier. It fits my tastes perfectly. I would recommend this product to everyone.
B005R9U2QQ|1.0|The photography of the outside of the building was beautiful; however,there was little effort put into character developmentment or plot.  This is a highly disjointed movie that is anything but scary.  The ending left nothing but questions.  It's a crying shame as the setting could have led to a well-developed and remarkably frightening movie. If this was supposed to be one of the \\"greats,\\", I'd like to see the worst!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|You will excuse me if there are any spelling errors or nonsensical sentences as I am SHATTERED writing this. May have something to do with the fact that I was up until 5 in the AM reading this book. I couldn't put it down, it was physically impossible!!!<br />I haven't been so engrossed in a romance that didn't have some sort of supernatural character in it for forever.<br />The love story between Abby (pidge) and Travis was epic. Granted I wouldn't want any daughter of mine hooking up with him but I wouldn't mind him for myself. I haven't loved a male lead so much since Jace in Mortal instruments.<br />And I absolutely loved her best friend America...exactly as a best friend should be, loyal to the point of ruining her own love story for you.<br />Granted it gets a bit violent in points and Travis can be very possessive, so if this offends you and you thought Bella in Twilight was trapped in an abusive relationship then this is definitely not for you.<br />But if you can accept that fiction is an exaggerated version of life than dive in and enjoy...just don't expect to get any sleep till you're finished.<br />(thank god for spell check lol)

140053271X|5.0|Make it simple the Nook is a better e-reader.  True, it does not have 3G, but my Kindle touch 3G stopped working almost right away and the 3G is only good for Amazon purchased content anyway.  Moreover, nothing beats being able to go to Barnes and Noble to get customer service by an actual person instead of being transfered 3 times before reaching a semicompetent customer service agent.  You can also connect to a Barnes and Noble WiFi and read the books you want for free up to an hour.  The Nook has one drawback, it does not have the Economist magazine available yet.  As soon I the Economist is available for Nook I will dump my Kindle.

0307959856|3.0|***SPOILERS****  Of course Ms. James can write.  What I was astonished to discover was that, despite her talent, her characters seemed tediously flat (though I enjoyed her descriptions Lydia) and mostly unlikeable.  Darcy was overwrought, Elizabeth was ineffectual, Wickham was the epitome of Snidely Whiplash, and Colonel Fitzwilliam turned out to be a selfish boor.  The book failed to engage me - I often found my attention slipping completely away from the story at hand. I restrained myself from skimming with superhuman effort and was pleased to see she shunted the Wickhams off to America.  The cover alone upped my score to three stars.

B006BXTOFC|4.0|These boys rock, for sure. This album is reminiscent of their older stuff--heavier on the southern country rock side, but still with a touch of that good ol' soul and funk. Definitely not as funky/soulful as that last genius album, \\"Brothers,\\" which totally knocked me on my heiny. Still very good, but if you are expecting something more like the last one (their \\"crossover\\" wonder), you may find this a touch disappointing. Just a touch though: they still bring that cohesive, meaty sound, with plenty of fantastic drumming and nasty-good guitar. Lyrically, they maintain the sexy/bluesy heartbreak stuff that I enjoy, too. I will remain a loyal fan. And if you're a smart cookie, you will too.
0345358945|5.0|I was kind of concerned that this would be some scientist flaunting his degree in my face. Instead it is very understandable and takes you step by step. Before I got this book I could rarely remember my dreams. Now I have a dream every night. Very much worth the buy.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|Probably like a lot of modern viewers, I had heard of but not read this book, nor seen the BBC TV series - Both were issued in the 1970's.<br /><br />I did though read a few summaries, knew that it was loosely based on the hunt for British turncoat spy Kim Philby, and went into the movie understanding that it requires very careful attention to keep up with the involved plot.  Seeing it cold, I still thought it was great, with terific performances by many decorated actors throughout the movie, and Gary Oldman is fantastic in the lead.  In some ways, if like me you see it without knowing the story first, his character is done in a way that helps take you into the story, as he barely says anything in the first 15 or 20 minutes of the movie and just seems to be watching what all is going on.  By the end, he has transformed into a strong character that has figured out the whole scheme.<br /><br />While I loved the movie, even without having read the book to know the full story, it felt like the plot was overly compressed to fit within 2 hours.  I watched it intently, but there were still a couple of developments in the plot, as done in the movie, that seemed like huge leaps.  Hopefully there will someday be a director's cut that fleshes the movie out a little better.<br /><br />One viewing tip, courtesy of the Seattle Times movie reviewer - the many flashbacks can sometimes be confusing, but one way to help keep them straight is the glasses worn by Gary Oldman.  He buys a new pair at the start of the movie, so the flashbacks show him with his old glasses - for the current events, he is wearing the new ones.<br /><br />Postscript:<br />-----------<br /><br />With the release of the movie on dvd and cable, many reviewers have now complained that the show is slow and boring. This is definitely not an action movie.  If you're looking for the latest James Bond type flick, this movie is not for you.<br /><br />On the other hand, director Tomas Alfredson (and John Le Carre in the book) probably assumed that the viewer would understand that this is a story of the very highest stakes -  As mentioned above, it is widely acknowledged to be a fictionalized account of the hunt for British turncoat spy Kim Philby.  Philby and his fellow Cambridge spies turned over vast amounts of classified British and US atomic and military information to the Soviets during the height of the Cold War.  Philby also later admitted providing the Soviets with the names of hundreds of Western agents during his long years as a Communist mole, and many of those betrayed were captured and tortured or killed by the KGB.  Le Carre could rightfully assume his readers in the Cold War era recognized the stakes involved without expressly stating such.  Alfredson apparently assumed the same for the movie, as nothing was added to the script to make this clear for modern viewers.  Personally, I think that was a reasonable approach, as it is apparent that the mole is at the highest level of British security, but it is clear from all of the reviews here that find the movie boring, many viewers feel otherwise.<br /><br />By the way, while the British eventually confirmed he was a Communist spy, Philby actually escaped to the Soviet Union before he could be prosecuted and was later honored on a Russian postage stamp....
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I had read other reviews and some were not very flattering, saying they were \\"disappointed\\". I will have to say that I am in no way disappointed, it is exactly what I wanted. I wasn't looking for a collectors item, just wanted all the movies together and that is what I got. So if you are looking for a collectors item do not order but if you are just looking for the movies it is a must buy.

B0018BB20W|5.0|This is an excellent deal for the number of songs you get. I think I paid over twice as much for this album, or one very similar, when it first appeared. While I find all the Moody Blues studio albums enjoyable, the original Days Of Future Passed shines a little more than all the rest. The orchestral interludes (arranged by Peter Knight, and based on the song melodies), are so well integrated into the whole album concept, you might think the orchestra is actually playing along with The Moody Blues. The Mellotron (played by Mike Pinder) does add some orchestral-sounding tracks to the songs, but it is NOT the orchestra. Now that brings me to an important point; let's give some credit to the orchestra, who helped make this album what it is. The London Festival Orchestra - conducted by Peter Knight - may not have survived beyond this project, but what they did here inspired countless rock musicians for many years to come.<br /><br />I also owned the original Days Of Future Passed, which ended with the distinctive gong; that gong rang for at least 30 seconds. For me, it was an important finale, or perhaps a transition: a \\"cooling-down\\" from a state of sonic ecstasy back to reality. At the end of this re-mastered album, the gong has been faded away in about 3 seconds. I understand that some people don't want to hear the gong, but no real gong fades away into silence in 3 seconds. Come on.
B000UR9QIK|5.0|Good transition on to blu ray.  If you dont know the movie, it is a classic and is well worth the money.  Picture and sound were wonderful for blu-ray, worth the extra couple dollars.
B005TTEFRG|4.0|I read alot of complaints about Momoa, but he definitely played a convincing Conan, and so did Leo Howard (young Conan) for that matter.  This seemed to be the type of movie where the story was the main character, followed closely by the special effects, then the cast.  The story is way better than the original, alot more depth and more time spent on young Conan - some of the best parts of the movie here.  The special effects are spot on, and look incredible on blu ray with an LED tv.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't listen to the critics/reviewers on this one.  I like to decide for myself if I like a film....<br /><br />The only aspect I could possibly criticize is that during some scenes, the cast lacked the gravity needed for an epic adventure like this one.  The dialogue seemed out of place, they used alot of contractions.  This made some of it seem more casual than it should have been.  Finally, I really think that Rose McGowan was not best choice for the role of the evil witch daughter. But she was good.<br /><br />Otherwise, this movie is worth a watch.
B004KRQFI0|5.0|Such a good CD, epecially for uner $5.00.  Do yourself a favor and check it out, if you are a fan of dubstep or even just deep bass/noise.  \\"Kill Everybody\\" is my personal favorite,  but every track is good.

1439133948|5.0|[[ASIN:1439133948 Cryoburn (Vorkosigan Saga)]]I can't help but enjoy any book that starts out with a really good hallucination.  Cryoburn does, and it just gets better as it goes along.  The hallucination is a allergic drug reaction and the protagonist really isn't any kind of addict (I know you think this will be dull, but trust me).  He's an interstellar diplomat named Miles Vorkosigan making an exploratory foray into a world his Emperor (and uncle, if I remember right) is interested in.  The whole world is nearly a giant frozen mausoleum.  Seriously.  It's run by a cryonics corporation consortium who freeze the old or sick and keep them pretty much forever.  You can imagine the susceptibility to abuse a frozen person may have...Miles starts looking into the place and the companies that run it and the people owned by it and, well, let's just say that Miles is lucky to have an armsman named Roic to help him with the rough spots.  There are quite a few rough spots.  This would be depressing if it wasn't so adventurous and so many great characters pop up in unexpected places, like the well-oiled machine of the shantytown where Mile's hallucination ends.  For once, the Audible version is cheaper than the CD, so get that and enjoy.  It is a stand-alone read, but part of the huge Vorkosigan Saga which is over a dozen books (or is it two dozen?).  This is the first one I have encountered, but it sure won't be the last.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|I purchased \\"The Tudors: The Complete Series\\" for my wife as a Christmas gift.  She loves it!  This Showtime series, which lasted four seasons, follows Henry VIII through historically accurate accounts of often sordid accounts of Court (both foreground and private), be-headings, gossip, the origins of the Church of England, and fictional liberties the writers took with major players against an opulent background of a younger England suffering growing pangs.  From the seedy to the sympathetic, very few characters are sketched without complexity, drive and motivation.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers carries this breakthrough Showtime series single-handed in many respects, giving viewers a look at historically accurate (profoundly beautiful in some ways, violent and ugly in others); however, the cast of actors, from those in the background to King Henry's closest subjects and allies, lovers and enemies, (especially Sam Neil in the first season) create an environment both believable and rich in atmosphere.  If you enjoyed \\"The Tudors\\" on Showtime, I recommend the complete series available in this handsome case; there are plenty of extras and, for those who value high quality, modern television at its finest, you cannot ask for a finer vision of King Henry's England than this.

B0013FYTA8|5.0|The biggest difference between this album and the band's earlier efforts is the sound of many tracks: rather than sarcastic or achingly loving, they grit their teeth, with adult angst shown in many forms. From the relationship woes of \\"By the Way\\" to the commitment fears of \\"All or Nothing,\\" the album would falter if surrounded by the atypically weak cuts that follow hard rockers going the midlife-crisis route. However, when the band rocks - like on \\"So Happy,\\" \\"Got it Made\\" or \\"Crutch\\" - they sound as delightfully noisy as they did on their first two albums, and the other ballads - \\"Heaven (Little by Little)\\" and \\"End of the Summer\\" - are crafted beautifully, with nary a sign of aged discontent on the horizon. Thus, whether hammering out heavy rockers for the boys or crooning through slower cuts for the adult contemporary crowd, Theory of a Deadman makes each song memorable here.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Bought this as part of the holiday lightning deals stuff that was happening on amazon.  Once I got it I was disappointed to realize it was missing a cable, the usb to DC power cable that actually powers it on.  To be fair, the company responded quickly to my email and had a new one shipped out to me, but I was still disappointed that I couldn't use it right away.  When the cable finally came in, I sat down and got everything hooked up.  Everything worked right away, and I haven't run into many issues.  I'm hearing things in games that I never knew were there(such as people behind me talking, cars in the distance, sirens, gunshots, etc), because I generally just had the xbox going through the tv for sound.    You can get the occasional pop from the headset which can be quite disconcerting, but it has only happened once in the several hours I've used it.  Overall a quality headset, but quality control could be a little better on the production line to ensure people aren't missing pieces.

B0039208CG|4.0|Joel Schumacher gets skewered constantly for running the Batman franchise into the ground, but trust me...95% if not 100% of that reputation should be on the hands of the next film in the series, \\"Batman & Robin\\". That one was so cheesy, it made the \\"Batman\\" 60's TV series look like high art. This one starts steering the ship in that direction, no doubt, but it's so fun and over-the-top and full of action, it's hard not to forgive it. First off, it's COLORFUL...you wanna see what the Burton \\"Batman\\" films looked like, just stare at a piece of black construction paper for 2 hours. That's about the gist of it. Secondly, it's got action...explosions...chase sequences...edge-of-your-seat how's-he-gonna-get-outta-this-one moments...the Burton films seemed pretty lacking in those, this one's got that in spades.  Thirdly, it doesn't look like \\"Batman's Big Adventure\\". I mean seriously, penguins with missles strapped to their backs?  The Joker pulling a pistol with a 3-ft long barrel out of his pants and taking out the Batwing with one shot?  That's the kind of stuff we'd let Pee-Wee get away with, but these are supposed to be grown-up movies. The introduction of Robin helps the story instead of seeming tacked on, and the performance of Jim Carrey is of course over-the-top, but why would you want the Riddler to be any other way?  Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face is a bit more of a weird proposition, he shoulda played it more like a straight Tommy Lee Jones bad guy without hamming it up so much, but then again...you can't have too much of a clash in tones.    Overall, my favorite non-Christopher Nolan Batman movie...'nuff said.
B005ZUR724|1.0|To be honest, I really enjoy the game, but the non-existent support by Gameloft is unacceptable.  There is no dedicated forum to O&C for Android/Kindle.  The game has been down for over 3 days with no official response stating they are aware of the issue or an update when it will be fixed.    Will I continue to play after the game is fixed?  I likely will to kill time, but I will not play after my 3 month trial ends.  Gameloft is also known for of having customers' credit card numbers being stolen during a data breach.

1594203059|1.0|The book attempts to define what we call Western Civilization and provide the answer to the (mythical) Rasselas's question \\"By what means ... are the Europeans thus powerful.\\" The book contains a lot of material but it is poorly organized and I did not find any new arguments in it. The historical fact is that until the early fourteenth century Western Europe was lagging not only the remote Chinese empire but also the Muslim states of the Middle East. The following story is indicative. In 799 the famous Caliph Harun al-Rashid received an embassy from Charlemagne. When the embassy went back it carried Harun's gifts that included a clock that was the source of amazement amongst the Europeans. During the Arab Golden Age (roughly 750-1250) learning and the arts flourished. But that came to an end while at the same time Western Europe was waking up.<br /><br />Ferguson provides six factors that underpin Western civilization: Competition, science, property rights, medicine, the consumer society, and the work ethic. However these factors are not independent and it is clear that some of them are the fruits of learning and commerce. Furthermore the author wanders around when he discusses each of the factors. For example the chapter on Science contains a long discussion of the second siege of Vienna by the Ottomans in 1683 even though science did not figure out in the outcome of that war. The Ottomans were not well prepared but they had hoped to take advantage of the religious disputes in Europe getting some Protestant Hungarians to join them against the Catholic Hapsburgs. That alliance produced little and at the end the Ottomans were defeated by the Polish cavalry that came to the aid of Vienna. (I rely on Caroline Finkel's book \\"Osman's Dream\\" for my account of the siege.)<br /><br />When Ferguson finally gets down to discuss Science he makes a blunder by stating that in Christianity Church and State have been separate because of fundamental Christian tenet stated in the Gospel of Matthew. But that tenet (together with much of the Gospels) has been violated in practice.  The Roman emperor Constantine I presided over a synod of bishops that defined in detail the minutiae of the Christian faith (Nicean creed). About 50 years later the Roman emperor Theodosius I made that version of Christianity the ONLY religion of the Roman Empire. This is a quote from the Imperial decree: \\"It is our pleasure that all the nations which are governed by our clemency and moderation should steadfastly adhere to the religion which was taught by St. Peter to the Romans, which faithful tradition has preserved, and which is now professed by the pontiff Damasus, and by Peter, bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness ......  Besides the Condemnation of Divine justice, (non believers) must expect to suffer the severe penalties which our authority, guided by heavenly wisdom, shall think proper to inflict upon them.\\" (The quote is from Gibbon's book, Chapter XXVII.)  This passage is instructive not only because it puts to rest any claims of separation of church and state but also because the Pope Damasus is listed in the same level as the bishop of Alexandria. The Pope did not become independent of the emperor and the main Christian authority until several centuries later when Alexandria fell under Muslim rule and around that time the Roman emperors lost control of Rome. (Ironically, their state continued to be called the Roman Empire, although modern historians refer to it as the Byzantine Empire.)<br /><br />This is certainly the worst but not the only flaw in Ferguson's analysis. My main criticism is that there is no effort to find the underlying cause for the Renaissance that later gave birth to the Industrial Revolution. Ferguson points out the importance of the Rule of Law but the question remains. Why did the rule of law take root in Western Europe and not elsewhere? Fareed Zakaria (in his book \\"The Future of Freedom\\") has pointed out that in resource rich states the rulers become wealthy by selling resources (oil is a prime examples) while in resource poor states the rulers acquire wealth by taxing their subjects, so it is in the ruler's interest to have affluent subjects. That is however a modern classification and the rule of law did not always exist in Western Europe.<br /><br />The best explanation for rise of the West I have read comes from Gibbon.

He achieved high positions and was a favorite of the emir Abu Yusuf al-Mansur to whom Averroes dedicated his \\"Commentary on Plato's Republic.\\" But in 1195 Abu Yusuf dismissed Averroes from his high office and sent him into exile in order to appease the Islamic jurists and theologians who did not like Averroes' rationalism.<br /><br />One could argue that the Crusades caused a rise in militancy and conservatism in the Muslim world that in turn caused the suppression of intellectual pursuits.

That is however a modern classification and the rule of law did not always exist in Western Europe.  The best explanation for rise of the West I have read comes from Gibbon.

B0041KKYBA|3.0|This documentary accurately portrays how big financial institutions contributed to the financial disaster.  It ignores the major contribution caused by the U.S. government (Frank, Dodd, Schumer, etc.) forcing FNMA/FRMC to lower borrowing requirements to support their \\"home ownership is a right\\" platform.  These guys swore FNMA/FRMC were sound, even when they knew otherwise.  No doubt the banks and deregulation had a big share of the blame, but the other major player is the US government fanning the flames of poor lending decisions.  The system wouldn't have collapsed if people could've paid their mortgages but too many borrowers were doomed to fail as soon as they signed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game rocks! !!!!! I enjoy playing this game everyday and all day long.  I just hope that they will make a new one with different games except the same ones all the time.

0786958731|5.0|This game is so fun. Being a guy that used play D&D back in the day but doesn't have the time to play a game that lasts 3+ hours, this is the perfect alternative. You can play with up to five friends or play alone controlling two characters since the monsters are controlled by cards that determine the attacks.  It always is unpredictable due to the innovative random tile sets. You can also easily design your own adventures as well.   Tons of replay, always action based, not to complex to learn and lots of fun!

B001BPJJ82|4.0|This indie movie came out in the middle of the last decade to obscurity with even most video stores such as Best Buy or Target not carrying this on DVD or Blu-Ray.  This is unfortunate as the movie is quite impressive.  The cast is comprised entirely of nobodies, though Lee Pace is now semi-famous due to two seasons of Pushing Daisies and an upcoming role in Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies.  The plot is quite unique, and features a story within a story, with the inner story drawing parallels with the outer story.  Both stories unfold using a variety of camera angles, filming styles, and a bevy of special effects that explore the affects of optical illusions, shadow, stop-motion photography, and various other tricks of the visual medium.  The soundtrack is based of a Beethoven symphony, though a movie of this caliber deserved its own original, orchestral soundtrack, but I guess John Williams or Hans Zimmer were too busy with bigger films.  The cinematography is exceptional, along with the visual effects and editing.  The dialogue however is short and somewhat lackluster.  None of the heroes of the inner, surreal story are good at either dialogue or speeches; no verbal wisdom a la Dumbeldorff, Gandalf, or Obi-wan Kenobi in this film.  Maybe the best performance is the child actress who does a wonderful job playing an innocent girl caught up in the desperate machinations of a fellow patient in their hospital dwelling.    Overall, the movie was great and engrossing while watching it.  However, the paucity of meaningful dialogue and the over-reliance on visual awe made the characters less than engaging.  Hence one the credits started rolling, I was ready to move on to the next movie.  The blu-ray itself is nothing special; no alternate ending or extended version.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really liked this game the reason I did was that it wasn't just one game u would grow tired of. it was many fun games so If u did get tired of one u could just could just switch to another game
1423113454|5.0|Rick Riordan makes an outstanding start to his new series The Kane Chronicles with The Red Pyramid. I won't review the plot, since that's been done, but will tell you why I liked it. First off, it's easy to like Carter (14) and Sadie (12) Kane, a quite dissimilar and often quarreling brother and sister, who take turns telling the story. Their quarrels add laughs to an already humorous book. (One chapter is called \\"I Have a Date with the God of Toilet Paper.\\") Riordan also gives us finely drawn allies--such as Khufu the chimp, Bast the Egyptian cat goddess, and Uncle Amos the magician--and terrifying villains and monsters. The many battles, using Egyptian magic, kept me on the edge of my seat, and Riordan surprised and delighted me with his imaginative inventions of magic battle tactics. Suspense builds as Carter and Sadie fight the forces of chaos, forging relationships with Egyptian gods and goddesses as they go. It's fun to learn about Egyptian mythology. The book has a satisfying ending, but leaves the doors wide open for the next books in the series--The Throne of Fire. Can't wait to read it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire<br /><br />I read the description for this book browsing for something to read on my new kindle, and it sounded like a good book. and it was only $2.99 so i bought it. from page #1 i couldnt put it down. i was enthralled by this book. It was such a page turner for me. Such an amazing book, if you like sexy scenes, love stories, with twists and turns and captivating characters. this book has become one of my favorites, honestly the best 3 dollars i ever spent. do yourself a favor and buy it. you'll see what i mean. it's a story i could read over and over. This book honestly needs to be turned into a movie. for any people in the movie business reading this review, you'll make bank if you make this. women will love it. in my opinion Travis should be played by Ian Somerhalder, Abby should be played by Phoebe Tonkin, America should be played by Amanda Seyfried, Shepley should be played by Keegan Allen, and Parker should be played by Penn Badgley. &lt;3

B0034G4P8A|4.0|With \\"The Avengers\\" due for release in 2012, there might have been a temptation on the part of Marvel Films to not be thorough with the two releases of 2011, \\"Thor\\" and \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\".  The first of the two releases...did much to eliminate that line of thinking.      \\"Thor\\" plays well on two levels--as a story of intrigue and betrayal among Norse Gods, it seems as if it is \\"Hamlet\\" on steroids; but carries some moments of surprising humor and pathos.  The humor strikes many who have known the Marvel character as surprising--after all, Thor and the fellow Asgardians have been primarily known for their Elizabethan English (The usage of \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\") and Thor's own rather severe nature.  Which is why credit must be given first and foremost to Kenneth Branagh.  Branagh has certainly had a history with The Bard's works, having directed \\"Henry V\\" in 1989 and \\"Hamlet\\" in 1996.  Certainly the Asgard part of the story--Thor's ascension to King of Asgard subverted by his half-brother Loki, and Loki's ascension to Odin's throne--plays as a Shakespearean tale...    But the earthbound part of the story--Thor's banishment to Earth, developing his relationship with the astrophysicist Jane Foster, and learning that a true leader will make sacrifices for the greater good--comes in a part of the tale which is at points humorous (If not laugh-out-loud funny), touching...almost endearing in many ways; while mixing in the action that superhero movies have to have.      Branagh mixes both elements of his Shakespearean training and more traditional leanings quite well here, and creates a very good introductory story.    Of course, it helps that the cast doesn't sleepwalk this out.  Chris Hemsworth pulls a magnificent double in this movie (For that matter, Hemsworth and his wife--Elsa Pataky, who played the Brazilian police liasion to Dewayne Johnson in \\"Fast Five\\"--probably rolled in a bunch of money this past summer).  Hemsworth captures a headstrong, willful, quick-to-anger warrior at the start; when cast out of Asgard without his powers he comes off as arrogant and spoiled--and maybe a little bit touched--but grows in the story.  But Hemsworth also provides charm and a pretty good gift for physical comedy that enhances the characterization.    Tom Hiddleston's Loki steals the show.  It is a brilliantly nuanced character that plays all sides against each other for his benefit, but Hiddleston gives the character a unique soul--angered at his origins and feeling deprived of his birthright, and willing to take out his anger on both his Asgardian family and the Frost Giants.      Anthony Hopkins and Rene Russo bring regality and power to Odin and Frigga--it is particularly nice to see Russo back at work after about a ten-year absence...Stellan Skarsgard plays Erik Selvig with a bemused look, but honest concern for Jane Foster; and Kat Dennings is a riot as Darcy Lewis.  Among Thor's fellow warrior gods, Jaimie Alexander's Sif is a delight--she seems to lead the Warriors Three (Including Ray Stevenson's Volstagg--Stevenson seems on course to become a member of \\"The Mighty Marvel Movie Players\\", people who have done different roles in Marvel movies, since he played Frank Castle in \\"Punisher: War Zone...).    Natalie Portman's Jane Foster is notable..touching, and brilliant.  Given that it follows her dark turn in \\"Black Swan\\", Portman has to call on a lightness and humor that hasn't been seen much with her.  Her Jane is a brilliant woman with a bad dating history, and when she has Hemsworth's Thor drop out of the sky onto her RV, she's a little overwhelmed by the mystery and the slightly imperious (Though charming) behavior.  The key sequence of the movie--when Thor proves himself a hero worthy of Mjolnir, the mighty hammer--is Portman at her best; sad at Thor's initial sacrifice to The Destroyer, but her shock at what happens when the hammer returns to Thor--her \\"Oh...my...god??!?\\" is priceless, as is her comments about Thor's usual clothing after defeating The Destroyer.  To paraphrase that line, Jane is a good look on Natalie.    Notable among the special features is the \\"one-shot\\" where Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson, the SHIELD operative from the Iron Man movies does a little manipulating in a side-story (Which also explains a scene from \\"The Incredible Hulk\\"...).    Again, Marvel Films could have been very sloppy with this story, figuring that nothing really counts until the summer of 2012.  But Kenneth Branagh didn't allow that, Chris Hemsworth couldn't allow that, and Natalie Portman wouldn't allow that.    Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great time killer.  works exactly as expected.  no surprises.  worth the free download.  that's why I give it 5 stars.
B000002KIK|4.0|I'd not heard this album for about 20 years. Oh, such a sweet re-union! Stories abound about the groups troubles at the time of recording this. Critics panned it.    I say; it's still Geezer and Bill on rhythm, Tony on guitar and Ozzy singing.     Not as slow as a lot of their earlier work. Some very heavy rock'n'roll and some beautiful bluesy numbers as well. I really like this as well as their other so-called troubled album, Technical Ecstasy.
0446585025|5.0|Ellen's newest book is her best one yet.  This book is hilarious and so entertaining to read.  It makes you laugh, even after you've put it down (if you can put it down).
1401902197|5.0|What the author says about every thought you think and every word you speak is an affirmation struck me as quite profound and the more I thought about it the more it seemed to be true and it is! Quite a small book, but the CD more than makes up for this. Very well set out and a great little set.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is by far the best radio/  music app you will EVER download! The paid version is well worth it!!!!
B001UV4XIS|2.0|Let me start by saying this is a great movie, certainly one worth adding to anyone's collection. This review does not reflect the film, which is easily 5 stars, but rather this version of it. If you are the sort of person who pays a little extra for the Blu-Ray + Digital Copy, you are going to find Ultraviolet to be severely lacking. Warner Bros had a great thing going with the Windows Media/iTunes digital copy; it was something everyone could use because everyone already has one of those two platforms. No one has Flixster as a digital movie repository, let's be realistic. All this does is fragment the idea of a digital movie collection, no longer can you just go to your computer and pick out the movie you want, you have to remember what service it is stored under, what password you use to get to that service, etc.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Had to add my two cents to the thousands of people who weighed in. I LOVED this book. Read the series, paused for about 2 breaths and started it all over again. Immediately.  I liked Katniss as a main character. At 17, she is very aware of what it takes to survive just on a daily basis. She has no time for boys and doesnt see herself the way others do. She is entirely focused on her family and making it back to them because she knows they need her. Enter the games. Exciting and thought provoking. What would it take to survive in a future where you have no control of your life and were under the thumb of the Capitol? Could you kill to survive?  Second book is also great. Third book- also good but not as epic as the first two. It was an attempt to end a series that had no natural conclusion within the world that was created.  I have recommended this book to close friends and all my family.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This show is our family's favorite and it's so nice to have them all on one disc instead of having to keep going back to the DVR.  Great show, great value.
0446547654|5.0|This is an excellent read. Mr. Sparks has a great way of developing his characters and causing you to connect with them emotionally. Although predictable at times, he also keeps you guessing which way the story will go at times. I'm usually not much for romance novels, but this one was good.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's fun. Eye twister and challenging.  Keeps my mind going.  Some of the games are repeats of other games from different stages.
B000P0J09M|5.0|\\"Goodfellas\\" is the story of boyhood friends who grow to become hardcore criminals. The depth of their ventures range from drugs to cold blooded murder, yet their own success gradually divides them as a unit. Treachery doesn't even spare those on the throne of criminal royalty, as the battle to avoid prosecution and jail time leads to sell outs for the sake of self-preservation. It is a graphic and entertaining gangster film.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

B000VUCIZO|5.0|Just an all around wonderful book about a wonderful human being. Steve Wozniak is just a great guy, and this book gives a fun peak into his life.  It's not about Apple, though it does cover his involvement with the creation of the Apple I, Apple II, and Apple Corp, but those are just a small part of the book.  Meeting Woz for lunch or dinner is one of those things on my bucket list :)

1451648537|5.0|My brother purchased one of the original Microsoft operating systems and continued with the various evolutions for many years, so when he took the enormous leap of converting his personal and business systems to Mac's, it was a surprise.  He soon became a huge fan of all the Apple products, and therefore of Steve Jobs. This was a Christmas gift to him.......and as I suspected, it was the perfect gift.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|In his short fiction, and sometimes in his longer fiction, King is the master of what I call the \\"Oh, *&$@!\\" ending. This is the ending where, just when you think the story is over, it proves that it isn't, and then ends, leaving you to imagine the horrific events to follow. Classic examples include \\"The Mangler\\", \\"Christine\\", and, of course, \\"The Mists\\".  This type of ending can leave the reader crying out for conclusion, and is difficult to pull off in a film where the viewer typically expects the story to wrap up neatly. This film performs the neat trick of being faithful to both the written work and the film-goer's expectations with a surprising twist. One is still left wondering about the cause and extent of the disaster, as well as the ultimate fate of the protagonist, while still feeling that the story had a satisfying conclusion.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|The best of me is the story of high school sweethearts who get torn apart and reunite twenty years later. Not as good as I hoped but still very good.

The Part 2 not only fell back into the bad habits of the first six movies, it fell off the cliff! Left out too many of the major parts of the book.

0385534639|2.0|I bought this book expecting to be dazzled, but instead of being a treat, this book became another chore that I had to plow through. If the author had spent less time trying so very hard to impress us with her imagery and more time on character development I feel this book might have been good. She's really not a bad writer. It's just that too many pages were spent on attempting to impress readers with not-so-magical pretty pictures. If pretty imagery were what makes a fun and entertaining read, why not just include pictures? Make it a picture book? A good book does not make the reader apathetic to its main characters, which I was. At the end, I really didn't care about what would happen to them: whether they lived happily ever after, or if they died a gruesome death. I just wanted it all to end.  I really don't understand why this book got so many positive reviews. It was really based on those reviews that I bought the book because I was too impatient to wait for a copy from the library. At this point, I can only hope to give a fair warning to the next potential buyer.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|For those that have played music for a living, originals band, Top 40, whatever ya did, or just wanted to, maybe you did some studio sessions too, you'll get it. For the younger boys and girls, just a love story, music is just the way to get there. Sidenote to the those that did studio work. In the USA, did that; UK folks, I'm guessing it was the same, the recording engineer is perfect, you'll get it mates :-) A romantic comedy, minus the sentimentality, just gave it as a gift to a good friend...neither of us live in the past, just a nice reminder of what it was... Worth watching, some girls, they get it too ... jb
B0063IH60K|4.0|I downloaded this app for my kindle fire and have enjoyed playing it very much. It is interactive and fun.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I love the series but what annoys me is what amazon is pulling here with the new $99 pricing. On November 28, 2011 which was a month ago they promoted the bluray for $129.99 as part of their black friday offers. I was led to believe that it was the cheapest it would be for a while so I picked it even though I could have waited and was in no rush. Nice going amazon! You drop the price in a month!!!  Another good reason I will not buy the kindle fire (and I am looking for a tablet) cause I expect similar nonsense on other products they sell. Would never expect this from Apple  The box set is amazingly detailed and just unwrapping it is a treat. Only concern is that the cd slip into the slot like a letter into an envelope and i am concerned for scratches. The show: AMAZING!
B005I548B4|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is not an author whose work I read often - however, these love stories are hauntingly beautiful. The story begins with Dawson Cole escaping alive from an oil rig explosion and being rescued by a dark-haired man. He returns to his home town after the death an old friend - the only decent father figure he ever knew -- and straight into danger for his very life. Amanda, the only woman he has ever loved, arrives to share his grief. What they uncover about the man whom they both loved - and the woman he loved - entwines with their own story.<br /><br />A hint of the supernatural, combined with very real danger to Dawson and Amanda is written with style. In spite of the unhappy ending and an unlikely coincidence - Nicholas Sparks seems to delight in these which was the only disappointment - I would keep this book if I had it in paperback.

0393324818|5.0|This is a fun nonfiction book about how Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, assembles a competitive baseball team with a fraction of the payroll of teams such as the Yankees and Red Sox.  This book is a worthwhile read for a number of reasons.  First, the story of the Oakland A's is interesting in its own right.  Additionally, embedded in this book are details of some recent advances in baseball statistics.  Reading this book will provide some explanation as to why you now see stats such as OPS (On-Base Plus Slugging) prevalently displayed on major sports networks such as ESPN.  Although this book is informative, it's not technical.  It's great for baseball and/or statistics junkies, but even if you know little about baseball and statistics, you'll be able to follow and appreciate this book.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Im an avid reader. Let me just state now, I have not written a review because I've never felt I had to. Until I read Beautiful Disaster which was actually a couple months ago so this is a late review but after everyone expressed their love for the book, I thought why not.  Im nuts for romances and bad-boy-meets-good-girls. You know? At first , when looking for a novel to read [kindle] , I would always see Beautiful Disaster, the cover was unappealing so I never bothered to indulge. Though, after book choices became scarce and I had little choice of what to read , I thought what-the-heck. This book however had me at the review. And not to mention , SO MANY STARS !! ... I bought it and from the first page, I was absorbed into the roller coaster story that was Abby&Travis. I completed the book in one night. Worth losing sleep over by the way. Now, I have to say , Im a little obsessed. Now , when looking for a book on Amazon, the first book I type in is of course Beautiful Disaster to look for similar books or just to indulge myself in what new readers have to say about the book and if it was enjoyed by them as much as by me. And after finishing with a book , I cant help but to compare it with BD. FIFTY SHADES OF GREY & FIFTY SHADES DARKER would cut close but no book has topped it.As yet.    Im also happy to see that the cover of the book has been modified, definately a better choice and depiction of the book. I have friends that do not read for pleasure as I do, but i practically flung this book at them, with no chances of saying no. Although, it took them a while , they too were mystified by this book and lets just say, they read quite often now, awaiting my suggestions on new books. Finishing this book, the absolute first thought was, a SEQUEL & after checking the website and discovering that YES THERE IS A SEQUEL to be released in February of next year, I hurried to call my  ' non-reading ' friends to celebrate. So with anxiousness and excitement ,we await the new book. Wrapping this up , Id just like to say this book is worth buying and is worth all your pennies. Thumbs up to the author and I look forward to her other reads.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Nice compact case and just what I was looking for.  The case holds the Kindle Fire snuggly and there is no danger of it coming loose from the case.  Rubberized texture ensures a good grip when toting it around.  As the product description suggests it is \\"lightweight\\", so don't expect it to protect your Fire from a 20 foot fall.  Indeed, the front cover is a little on the thin side and only designed to protect the screen from scratches and gentle knocks from shifting around in a backpack or bag.  Overall a great product for my needs.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Each book was better than the last.  Great characters, and explanations were well described without becoming dry.  I'm glad these were recommended to me.
0385534639|4.0|This book is what I wanted [[ASIN:0765356155 Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell: A Novel]] to be. The first 40 pages didn't thrill me (I usually can't stand books written in the simple present tense), but once the circus opens its gates, the whole feel of the world changes. The middle section - really up until the last 50 pages or so - is ephemeral, vibrant, imaginative, and manages the balance between real and unreal with the same grace as, say, Charles de Lint, who could have written whole scenes here and I wouldn't have been shocked.   The strength of The Night Circus is (thank goodness!) the circus itself. Sections of the narrative are written as if the reader is exploring the circus as an ordinary visitor, but the sense of wonder really comes from the two main characters and how they interact with both the audience and the circus itself. I will say that you can approach the descriptions of the circus in two ways. You could read them as words on a page, appreciate them for their descriptiveness and imagery, maybe even enjoy them for the ambiance they add. You'd be bored in 100 pages, to be honest. Another tent? Another act? So what? There is another option, which I hope you'll take. Approach this book in the same way that the outsiders approach the circus, and you'll be enthralled right along with them. Read as if you were actually going to a circus: with the expectation that what you see is meant to amaze you. Go along for the ride, and the book turns from good to great.   The two main characters, without giving too much away, are two magicians (the term is debatable) who are set to compete against each other by two other magicians (again, debatable) who have a long-standing feud about...well, it matters, but not as much as what happens once the stage is already set, pun intended. The plot is complex and tightly woven, and the two champions' dance around and towards each other is slow and intricate. It's a treat to read a romance that has so much patience to get where it's going. Not that this is entirely a romance - in fact, the best bits have nothing at all to do with it - but it's refreshing to read about romance in the way that it sometimes happens: slowly, impatiently, and inexorably.   Celia and Marco, the two competitors, are wonderful to read about, yes, but my favorite character has to be Herr Thiessen, the master clockmaker and circus outsider who crafts a clockwork timepiece grand enough to display in the circus's main courtyard. I'll admit, I do have a thing for clocks and watchmakers etc., but Herr Thiessen is the best-written character in the story. He's the reader's way in: an outsider who was called on because of his skill to create something transcendent. He's a believable character - not quite ordinary, no, but if the world were only a tad bit different, and the stars aligned, then maybe, *maybe* it could produce someone like Herr Thiessen. The circus is too grand and too magical to be appearing in your city tomorrow, but Herr Thiessen could be living in Germany right now. I could believe that.   On the whole, this book is deliciously subtle. The individual threads of the plot sometimes seem to be written just for the wonderment of it all - and maybe sometimes they are - but so many of them turn out to be vitally important. Guns are shown in the first act, but maybe you won't recognize that they're guns. Maybe they're not really guns at all, and maybe you might forget all of them before the last act, when they all go off. Four stars for this book - mainly because I'm still not sure how I feel about the ending - and if I'm still thinking about it in 3 or 4 months, I'll revise it to a 5. Damn fine storytelling.
0609610570|5.0|Although this is a book that doesn´t rely on data to reach its conclusion, it is an excellent book in giving you tips in how to manage a successful organization.  I really liked the fact that the book focuses on leadership, and on people development. Larry Bossidy's success at managing honeywell by focusing on people is a powerful reason to follow his advice.  This is definitely one of my favorite business books, and I find it to be one of the most practical of all.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|The video came quickly and was here before Christmas. Kids love the Lion King and so will Mom and Dad.
034552554X|4.0|The story of foster child Victoria Jones, this novel follows her as she ages out of the system and tries to find her way in the world. Victoria has lived in a series of foster and group homes. When she turns eighteen lack of education and resources leave her homeless. A job at a florist's shop offers promise for the future, but Victoria will have to deal with the demons that years in the foster care system have invested in her. Victoria's life is full of mistrust. Her most important asset is a knowledge of flowers, gained from one of her foster mothers. It is this knowledge that will give Victoria a means to build a life in the adult world.<br /><br />The book tells parallel stories, of Victoria's adulthood and her childhood in the foster care system. The most interesting part is the information on flowers and their meanings that weaves throughout the book. The book provides a startling and unvarnished picture of life in foster care. The danger, the neglect, the abuse, is all part of Victoria's life. As an adult Victoria is difficult to love. Her fear of closeness and committment, while understandable, is also maddening. That said, her story hooked me from the beginning.
B004G6009U|5.0|he movie came quickly and in time for Christmas Day. Tangled is a fun movie with great characters and my granddaughters love it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book. After reading some of the bad reviews, I wonder if the reader was so good I missed all these bad parts? Personally, I loved the book. The descriptions were wonderful. I don't have the most vivd imagination, but I was imagining this circus in my mind, wishing I could go. I liked how times and locations changed, overall. However, in audio form this became confusing and I lost track of how much time was passing.<br /><br />There were a few downsides but not enough to drop stars, as I thoroughly enjoyed the read (listen). I would have liked a little explanation as to why they held these duels. Also, I don't understand how they fell so deeply in love by just touching and then maintained this through such long stretches of time. However, I suspended my beliefs and logic so I could be swept away, so these were minor to me.<br /><br />I have recommended and loaned this to others who enjoyed it as well!

B005VJ8ATS|4.0|...but it was still a good movie.<br /><br />The questions Another Earth asks and forces the viewer to ask oneself are intriguing. I chose this film thinking it was a Sci-Fi type of movie and was surprised to find it was more philosophical, more sophisticated, and less glitz and glamour than I thought I'd encounter.<br /><br />It's not your typical Hollywood style, blow 'em up or razzle dazzle 'em movie. It's pace is slower. It's main character, Rhoda, is more complex than most standard blockbuster stars. It's plot is also deeper than most movies I've viewed recently.<br /><br />If I had one complaint, and perhaps this is why it didn't do better at the 'box office', it would be how it was depicted in the trailer. The trailer had me believing this would be a 'Contact' type of film, but that was not the case. So, if it was billed as a sci-fi film and viewers went to see a sci-fi film, they were sorely disappointed. Yes, it has tinges of science fiction in it, but the main focus of this movie was not Earth Two, rather the characters on Earth One were under a microscope, living their lives for the viewer to observe. Had this been portrayed as a philosophical movie it may not have startled me so much when the actual plot evolved. It was a good plot. But it is not a sci-fi movie about another Earth. It's a movie about choices we make, how they affect our lives, and what we do with those choices. Another Earth, and the fact that they find this planet, is merely another twist in the characters' lives that they must deal with...and ask themselves...what should they do and thus we the viewers find ourselves asking...what would we do.

140131046X|5.0|For months I had been devouring books suggested by friends, family, teachers, and even book review websites. I was desperately looking for something to inspire me, something to give me hope, and of course a little more faith would have been icing on the cake. Such is the way of life when unexpected traumas shake your core and you begin to question everything.<br />I found all that and much more in this book. It helped answered many questions that so often daunts us in our day to day life. It helped me open my eyes and see the world a different way. And above all - it helped me realize - I don't have to all the answers - no one does - and that's ok!<br />Thank you for such an inspiring and well written book!
B000HIVOI2|4.0|First thing first, if you buy this movie, turn the subtitles on! Otherwise you might be listening to up to 7 minutes of alien talk without any idea what they are saying! lol.  The bad. Certain spots are grainy, and some spots look like something off of a VCR. It goes from grainy to clear and back to grainy in scenes.   Now the good. First thing, the price. I got this for 5 bucks at Target. A steal at that price. Second, the movie looks pretty good compared to earlier releases. Most of the desert scenes look great. Lastly, the Blu Ray sound is awesome. The soundtrack really shines through, and the scenes when they go from Stargate to Stargate sound and look awesome.  Don't pay much more than $5 for it and it's worth the pick up.
0857685570|5.0|To see more pictures from inside the book, please visit my blog via my Amazon profile link.<br /><br />Oeuvre is the most fitting title for legendary illustrator Drew Stuzan's gorgeous book, an expansive collection of the artist's most iconic movie poster art, as well as commercial and personal work. At a whopping 314 pages, this is the most comprehensive Drew Struzan art book yet published.<br /><br />Even if you're unaware of the artist's name before reading this article ( I myself did not know until I got into art school ), you must have seen his fascinating work in one form or another somewhere before. It was only after reading this book however, that I come to realize just how much work he has done.<br /><br />A must have for any Drew Struzan fan. Highly recommended.
B006QPVGKG|4.0|I can understand how some people would not care for this movie, but I think that is just because they don't understand exactly what they are looking at.  I read one review that complained that you never get to know the astronauts all that good.  Well, if you keep in mind that this movie has been edited and spliced together from old decaying footage that has supposedly been recovered from a secret moon mission, then it makes sense.  The guys on this mission have known each other for an extended period of time (training and such) so why would they take time out during a mission to \\"get to know each other\\"?  Also you have to keep in mind that these supposed astronauts are just trying to survive, they are not stars in some blockbuster action flick, or reality show..  They are supposed to be real, normal humans, the acting in this movie isn't SUPPOSED to be acting, it's supposed to be what a real person would say, do, and feel under the same circumstances.  I personally think the movie was very well done, and I am glad that I have seen it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is just like solitaire. fun and easy to play on the go! great app to download and it's free!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Bought The West Wing: The Complete Series Collection when Amazon had it at a great price. Delivery was fast (as usual). If you like The WW, you'll like the collection. If you're a liberal, particularly one who appreciates witty banter, you'll love the series. If you're a conservative, who knows?
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app works well, doesn't lag or anything. the two different types of deals makes it fun to compete with others or yourself.
B003Y5H5AQ|4.0|I bought this for my 3 girls, ages 2,4 and 5. We all liked the movie very much and as always we had a great experience with amazon.
B005MIYI3K|4.0|Imaginaerum is the latest offering from Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish and it is a beautifully crafted album that is a massive step up from their previous work and helps push them near the top of the symphonic metal genre. Imaginaerum almost plays like the soundtrack to a Tim Burton film as it mixes interesting song arrangements with lots of dark musical passages into an awesome cinematic effect. The production is outstanding and the overall vibe of the album screams epic aided by the amazing use of the orchestra that lifts the intensity of each song. Massive praise must be given to songwriter Tuomas Holopainen and his vocal muse Anette Olzon who combine their talents brilliantly to produce a very memorable musical experience. The entire album is a musical tour de force and although picking highlights in a concept album like this is difficult, some highlights worthy of mention include the eerie album opener \\"Taikatalvi\\", the absolutely epic sound of \\"Storytime\\", the complex arrangement of \\"Ghost River\\", the celtic influence of \\"I Want My Tears Back\\", and the stunning Danny Elfman vibe of \\"Scaretale\\". There are just enough mad hatter moments to make Imaginaerum very unique without alienating potential fans and the step up in quality from Dark Passion Play will be definitely appreciated by fans of that album. Imaginaerum is an awesome symphonic metal album that is highly recommended to fans of Blackmore's Night, Kamelot, and Sonata Arctica - 4.5 stars.
