B008IJTFYW|5.0|Simple, customizable, and the ads are unobtrusive. Love that you can set the timer to turn off the sounds AND the app. Works great. Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot;. I hardly ever buy apps, but I bought this one, I liked it so much.
0307719219|4.0|Puts his finger on the pulse in a very incisive way. Many (perhaps too many) examples to demonstrate the validity of his thesis.<br />I thought he might develop his argument to include the remarkable exploitative bankers -  regretfully not so.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really good fun, great graphics,would definitely recommend. It's great game for animal lovers .<br />You can buy other horses too and chose locations. Different competition s to enter your horse in to.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book gives you a whole different perspective on flowers and how other people view them.  The characters have shown this in an interesting story line.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is easy to use and as simple as they come. Personally I the colored screens for the times when a white light is too much.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's great fun :) try it it is worth it trust me :) I have already build a town you can't get bored of this game it's to good.
B005PK553C|4.0|Don't quite love it. Picture and sound quality are excellent on my ipad.<br />I will continue to watch it. Sometimes the story line is a little confusing but<br />I confuse easily.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Interesting and different mystery novel. Interesting due to the variety of characters involved and different with co-primary characters. One a secret service agent and the other a long ago CIA operative/assasin. Also enjoyed the government agent bad guys.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is a movie for the ages, as is the book itself.<br />The film is captivating and draws  you in from the beginning--no &#34;pause&#34; breaks from me!  I loved it that much.  Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were both excellent but Ann Hathaway is brilliant.  The actress who sang &#34;on my own&#34; blew me away.<br />If you don't know the book there may be some confusion with a few characters but nothing that detracts from the film--you just wouldn't know you were missing something.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like that it's fast paced and that you don't have to move the screen like in temple run.it keeps my interest well.and as a bonus my two year old can play this game ok.
0312588887|5.0|Barbara Taylor Bradford can develop charcters and places in time like very few authors.  It's a gift, not a learned technique. This book  and the subsequent series too me to the moors of England and inside the gentry's homes and characters.  It paints the hopelessness of Leeds and the plight of the Jews.  The privledged's lack of respect for anyone not of their &#34;class&#34; and the drudgery of being a servant is crystal clear.<br />This is a book where everyone is flawed, even the heroine--especially the heroine, perhaps.  It's a book that keeps you turning pages thru the night(s) and one you'll read more than once.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This single is absolutely fantastic. As a longtime Daft Punk fan, I am thrilled to see DP sticking to some of their trademark sounds while opening up a new world of music. Pharrell Williams butter-smooth voice is a perfect complement to the vibe.<br /><br />This song is a time capsule, but you can't tell if it's from the past or the future.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I loved it. Some may be turned off by the language and such, but it's to be expected from QT.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I want more. This book makes me think twice  about things and how similar the two characters are to me
B00454U1O2|3.0|I purchased the &#34;clean&#34; version of this album because I love Pink's girl power message but would like to listen to it with my tweenies without the foul language. The only editing on this album was the f word, otherwise it was unedited. I am So disappointed. I wish I hadn't wasted my money.
1603420398|5.0|This book is very exciting due to the most unusual designs, instructions and illustrations!  This book also explains yarn weights and usages and crochet hook sizes.  I can't wait to get started on a project!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Extremely enjoyable book. I wish I had read it many years ago. The story makes one wonder if there truly treasures buried.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I adore this movie and could watch it every week.  I have no issues with the movie at all.  It is funny for all ages but will appeal to 20's-50's group.  It was witty, hilarious, addicting, and true to character while updating their images which I thought would be impossible and it wasn't.  I am dying to see the next movie that's going to be out.  J.J. Abrams is a genious!<br /><br />  The shipping was so quick on this movie and the price was even better.
B00846REIS|4.0|The good: The characters are well developed. The story is intriguing and draws you in, making you want more.<br /><br />The bad: spoiler alert... I got very tired of her constantly running. It made parts of the story incredibly repetitive and skim worthy.<br /><br />The overall (there wasn't any ugly): Good story line that draws you in and makes you wonder where it's going to go.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book is a VERY quick read.  I enjoyed it but wish that it was longer and had more character development.  I wanted to know more about Tiffany and more about what caused Patrick to go to the \\"bad place\\" for years.  I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie because typically a book is far better than the movie.  I think in this case, the movie will be better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Hugh Bonneville and the entire cast.  Great acting and entertaining plot line.  I can't wait for next season!
B005PK1G76|1.0|This Organizer is so annoying. It is driving me and husband crazy. The velcro straps keep slipping and go all crooked and forget having a small cup of coffee with top on- sloshes all over. This was a waste of my money so I am looking into a better one for my Bug Cam.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|We never the watched the show until now and we love it. Terrific acting. Great plot lines. Highly recommended. Yes.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|after a month or so of playing it stopped working.  just hangs on the imagini screen. tried to uninstall but doesn't uninstall completely.  try to re-uninstall and it says it can't be found. app store thinks it's still installed so I can't download and reinstall.
B0063IH60K|5.0|nice graphics - great brain exercise<br />nice to have an old standard game on my kindle fire.<br />loads up quickly - good to go.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very good app for checking local and national weather. Easy to use and very clear. Will use for home and travel.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Thought-provoking movie.  I hope some unbelievers were touched by this movie.  God is real.  He designed us to have various organs with specific purposes and emotions, etc.  No way we got here by accident or some scientific explanation.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I'm having so much fun with this game.<br />and the best part is you can progress in the game without spending any of you real money unlike a lot of other &quot;free&quot; games. I have not been able to put it down.
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|I like this story so very different, some may think it's slow but you have to go with the flow and any other way would spoil this movie, well done enjoyed it very much.  Barbara. Australia.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I enjoyed the book and enjoyed comparing the book to the movie. I agree it was well done considering how difficult the imagery was. I am not sure how much I would have enjoyed the slow parts with no book history.
B005UPOAT2|5.0|Not a bad movie even after all this time, have to say one that I would watch over and over again, nice to have in my collection for that reason.  Barbara. Australia.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very awesome game u feel very happy when u pick up a mystery box and find out u won 1000000 coins. Also I think probably. Helps your mind work faster GREAT GAME WHOoooooooooHooooooooo
B003HARV4S|5.0|You have to watch this a few times for the movie contains so many hidden bits that you miss, very well written really holds you in your seat, you will want to watch it again as well, I enjoyed this one.  Barbara. Australia.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I love the game but it still has a few bugs with it in multiplayer. the games campaign could also be added on since it has very little story and is some what short.
B000KG499M|5.0|This stand does it's job. Exactly what you'd expect out of a stand.. More connection parts than you will ever use and easy to build. pick one up.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Definitely a page turner...will keep you in suspense and a little hot and bothered even. But you must read the next book as well...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator is very easy to use and free. It is great when as you are shopping and trying to stay within budget.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|I did enjoy the book but hard to get into the book. It was short and that is how I was able to finish the book.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|A awesome way to.end Nolan's dark knight franchise ! Loved it , bane was really great and Anne Hatheway was so great as catwoman and doesnt hurt that shes super hot either !
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Great cast,; Historically very accurate. wonderfully written, beautifully photographed, a great soundtrack . and so on,so on , and so on.
B005LAIISU|5.0|This is another great addition to the ice age franchise . Looks amazing on blu ray and is a great movie for all ages to enjoy over and over again ! If you want a awesome animated movie on blu ray, then pick this one up !
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I've never picked up a Follett book that I didn't like and this is no exception.  I read this one a long time ago so it's not fresh in my memory, but it is one that will remain on my bookshelf with plans to re-read it at a later date.  When a book is really, really good, I like to savor it a second time.  This is that kind of book.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|This is a really awesome movie on blu ray ! One of my favorite disney movies, despite it not getting the praise it deserves . Its just amazing and is one everyone can enjoy anytime !
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever if you like temple run the first you will love this one it is 100000000000000000000000000000 times better and has awesome graphics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004K00NEO|5.0|Its a awesome movie in blu ray ! Animation is just crisp, clear , colorful , looks beautiful on blu ray . My two year old son absolutey loves it too!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book was so good and deep and touching and aw it is so sad yet happy and it just hurts
B008MU8ZOI|5.0|Was so excited to watch this one on blu ray , and i was defintely not dissapointed , love this movie . Reminds me of the old style of horror movies, the way they still should do them . Looks amazing on blu ray !
B0091REZMW|3.0|I was excited at first that there was an app to find hidden objects (I absolutely love these apps) on my Kindle, but quickly became disappointed that the quality and the premise of the game was less than I expected and not interesting at all.
B00AHEDXXA|5.0|I absolutely love this movie ! Best mib movie since the original , looks awesome on blu ray too ! Great action and very funny ! Will smith at his best , higjly recommend this one !
B0095P31L6|4.0|I decided to watch this basically out of sure boredom, I figured what the heck, I'll give it a try. I was plesantly surprised that it was much better than I expected.
B005LAII80|3.0|I am not opposed to violence in film when used in context and integral with the plot. I was just a little surprised that this movie was so different from the first Judge Dredd.<br />The film really gives you a lot of 3D gore.  More than any other movie I have seen so far.<br />There is no point comparing this movie to the first Dredd movie.  There is no plot similarity and no comedy relief (which helped the first movie get by due to a silly premise).<br />I am not a fan of the original comic book Dredd so I can't comment if this follows the comic book character.<br />What you will get with this DVD is decent 3D, violence, gore and a typical vengeance type plot - good guys over bad guys, set in an overpopulated, ghetto metropolis, crime ridden future earth.<br /><br />Many teens will no doubt love the weaponry and gore.  For me it was not enough.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|Everytime I tried to use this app it would end unexpectedly. Every single time. I wish I could have gotten it to work but<br />It just wouldn't. Too bad.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This was the first book of the series that really took off. Holy Christmas. Very intense, shocking ending, looking forward to the next book!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I don't have much to add to what other reviewers say about this app, except to say I like the large graphic and it works well on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game. Just wish it would have been a little longer for the money I paid. It was a few hours of fun though.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Last summer over several weeks my husband and I watched the Bond films in order.  I loved all the Bond characters over the years by Daniel Craig is by far the best fit for the Bond persona.  I am partial to Casino Royal so this is not my favorite of his Bond films but we still enjoyed it immensely.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a great puzzle game that reminded me a little of the old PC game MYST. I wish there had been more puzzles but it was greatly entertaining for an hour or so. The puzzles are not anything too difficult, anyone teen aged and older would probably be able to solve most of the puzzles fairly easily. All in all, I'm pleased I got it. Can't wait  for the next one!
B000NY12LO|5.0|This is a very sad and compelling book, it's hard to imagine this could be real life and kids and families have to go through this! It really hits home, you hope you or your child never has to go through a situation like this!
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|why dont have Lego Bilbo minifigure inside of this pack?<br />I don`t get the  Lego Bilbo minifigure<br />how can i get it?
B006903GX8|5.0|This book places the show in actual events in history and relates that history very nicely.  You learn a great deal about what goes on behind the scenes in the show.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|It was difficult to read and could not post. I much prefeer FB on my lap top to this verson. I could not bring up the game I play from the Kindle either.
1600595871|5.0|Great addition to our library. Fantastic resource for book makers.  Refer to it frequently & recommend it to anyone interested in bookmaking.
B007MC8YLQ|2.0|I play free cell all the time on my computer but it was difficult to play on my kindle. I have only tried a few times but each time I found it difficult to figure out.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This charger does not fit well with a rugged case like the Poetic Revolution but that is not the fault of the cable. It does fit very well on my Poetic hardback case. I am pleased with how fast the pogo cable charges my Nexus 10. It is also great that it's magnetic so if the cord gets yanked it doesn't do damage to my Nexus 10. Highly recommended at any price!
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I live in a small community north of Sacremento but this only gave the news of the big cities not of Chico or Oroville.
B00006AW63|1.0|I am very upset because when I put the movie in my DVD player it tells me to check the regional code so I have not been able to watch it at all. I can say that I will NEVER order a movie on amazon again because I am now out the 20$ plus shipping I paid on the movie!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I am having difficulty staying focused with this book but it is interesting. I read a little set it down read something else then come back to it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|my grand daughter and I played it all night lol dye hair wash hair cut and shve men and womens hair it so cute need more apps lol
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read this after my adult niece said it was a must-read. The characters and real-life emotions kept me up late reading since I couldn't put it down.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is the best app I have ever bought money well spent although recently I had to get a new device and so all my memory was deleted and I had bought  all the expansion packs and stuff but now I don't have any of it but I still have app and I want to know what can I do?
0312430000|3.0|Clear enough evidence of the success and importance of the checklist.  I found the narratives overwhelmingly tedious and repetitive.  Enough already with the evidence-I'm a believer in checklists.  I bought the book thinking it would change my daily life.  It didn't really.  It just gave me proof enough that doctors, nurses, construction managers, and airline people better have a checklist.  I was convinced halfway through the book.  That's where I stopped.
B0084HJE0S|3.0|Really a helpful book and i learned basics well. I look forward to more books like this in future. Great book
B007FJFDXS|5.0|You're a block.  Your whole world is blocks.  Even your enemies are assemblages of blocks.<br /><br />I liked this - you basically roll your block forward, up, down, and back to get through mazes.  You'll have to avoid some obstacles, enemies, and lots and lots of holes.  Has the nostalgic feel of an old 8 bit nintendo game, but graphics are modern and responsive.
0802473156|5.0|I would recommend this book to any married couple whether you're having marital conflict or not. It normalizes the fact that after about 2 years of any relationship, and after being married for a period of time, the &#34;honeymoon stage&#34; will definitely end. That does not mean you cannot find ways to foster love in the relationship. And Dr. Chapman provides excellent examples of how speaking in your partner's &#34;love language&#34; can significantly create a more fulfilling, loving relationship that can be sustained in the long-term.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Most of these utility type apps don't impress me too much, but this one is wonderful.  There's a pretty good number of preloaded sounds, most of which are actually really nice - a couple odd selections, but everyone's different, I guess.<br /><br />What makes this over the top is the smoothness of the audio loops - the jarring loop sounds so often present in these apps is absent.  There's also the ability to mix multiple sounds together - such as a rainstorm and birds, for example, and individually adjust the volume of each piece of the mix.  And lastly, third parties can submit their own sound loops which you can download for free through a link in the app.  Most of these are wonderful as well.<br /><br />Good work all around.
B0060D11LI|4.0|Great dancing. Nice story. Appropriate for my 8 year old son who is into hip hop. He danced for hours afterwards.
B001VFTYWI|4.0|This book picks right up from the previous installment, Black Notice, so I recommend that you read that one first. The first few chapters are a bit tedious as Kay Scarpetta goes through a lot of introspection from almost being murdered in Black Notice. I was hoping for more action and it slowly comes around, but not to the same suspense as the earlier books of the series that made me turn page after page.<br /><br />I think if you are a Scarpetta series fan, you'd like this book, as you've been bringing the history of Kay, Benton, Lucy and Marino along with you. I think many reviewers here are a bit harsh, even though this is not as good as the first few in the series. If you are new to the series, this would probably be a 3 star book.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Great job V5!  The free version was fun to play & it worked fine, definitely worth the purchase.  It`s got good graphics and is an engaging search game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|hours and hours of fun!  best game ....friends can join your worlds on line. Build tools armour fight zombies creepers skeletons &amp; spiders.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Great movie<br />Nice having this on blu ray so we can remember how corny this movie was. It makes me laugh.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|This sucked plain and simple.  Controls were horrible, game was horrible-er and just dumb.  So many better things to do than this game.  Wash the dog, unclog a drain, you get the idea.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|while the cinematography was great...i expected a bit more from the story. but, it did lay out the ground work for the rest of the adventure. i look forward to the rest of the &#34;journey&#34;...
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Can't wait for more.... I watched it all in one sitting.  I am anxiously awaiting Season 3  with Kathy Bates
B000YMM3CC|5.0|see it with you best friends lover or soul mate.I saw it at least 15 times and still love it
B003M0H4NG|5.0|Miles said he could do fusion and he did.  And I knew Miles when he was a block.  best band ever.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|So nice to see the end of this amazing saga. It kind of was one long battle, but with enough other things happening to keep you figured!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I am sure I'm not the only avid reader who reviews the reviews before I purchase a kindle book.  When it comes to \\"The Misremembered Man\\" the multitude of four and five star reviews were absolutely \\"spot on\\".  I was totally engrossed from the first page.  Ms. McKenna is to be congratulated for creating a world of that invites one in.  It's been quite some time since I read a book that made me laugh out loud.  Please meet Jamie McCloone, his dog Shep, his dear friends Paddy and Rose McKadden, and an interesting cast of friends and neighbors who live in rural Ireland in 1974.  Ms. McKenna draws a portrait of a man and his surroundings that is compelling, evocative, poignant, horrific (at times) and completely believable.  I, for one, can't wait for Ms. McKenna's next effort.  I LOVED this book!
B00005JLEX|5.0|This is seasons one and two of Seinfeld. It's on DVD. It has four discs. Starring Jerry Seinfeld. Review complete.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was an amazing book. Full of detail and I love how you know everything he is thinking. I would read this book time and time again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was a very difficult read for me. A dear friend of mine just passed away from osteosarcoma so this book really hit home for me. Nonetheless, it was beautiful. Definitely my new favorite book.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This was a long-awaited film for me after reading the book a number of years ago and then listening to the audible book on my daily commute I now have amazing visual interpretation.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It is great for my class because it just helps me out for my English homework so I can look up words
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Literally read this in one sitting.  Didn't even get up to use the restroom.  Such a fantastic story!  Thought provoking.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read the more I read the more I got into it the third book is by far the best.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Watched with my Grandsons. They loved the movie & laughed a lot.  I found that t was enjoyable.  Thank you
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am 33 and I love this game so far. I guess it's something to do. I think my son will get a kick out of raising his own horse. I will try it out, and see what he thinks about it.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|was a gift for a friend who was a BIG George Harrison fan - loved it!! -  i was happy the product was mailed so quickly and i was able to send it off on time for her birthday. thank u.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|Its a bit flimsy for my taste I returned it, also doesn't have a pocket to hold your camera with the lens on, should have one on top but does not, otherwise decent size.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|If you liked Season 1 you will love season 2, especially the last 2 episodes. Great production values each episode has feature film qualities.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|The best album put out yet from Mr Blake Shelton...There is not a bad song on this album, love them all.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Wholesale slaughter , sex, magic , and intrigue. What more could you as of an epic fantasy. George R.R. Martin does it agin.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The humor, editing, every bit of the movie was a gem.  The sheer mastery of how human and animal emotions intertwine stuck a real chord in me as an animal lover.  This is a movie for the ages.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Right from the top I must admit that I am a Jamie Foxx fan and he did not disappoint.<br />I did not even pause the movie for a bathroom break, or even to get refreshments.<br />I cannot put it more candidly than that.<br />This is how you make a hit movie.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Fantastic movie! This movie was brilliant, I feel it shows real life experiences.  I love how there was a great twist of comedy.<br /><br />A MUST WATCH!!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I really enjoyed Dalinar and Kaladin. They are both warriors learning what it means to incorporate humility and service into excellent leadership.<br />The world of Roshar is amazing, and I love the interludes that give us glimpses of going-ons apart from the main plot. The mysteries of this world really leave you wanting to know more, not just of the plot, but of the world itself.<br /><br />Shallan fell a little flat for me, as her wit/wry humor has been some what overused by Brandon through various writings (I feel like she is like lightsong recycled...maybe he was reborn in her:); not a big deal at all, but It would be nice to see a shy female character who is actually shy, not just acting shy to thinly veil her razor sharp wit; yawn.<br /><br />But I still REALLY love this book and world. I even like Shallan, conceptually and hope she will grow on me in the next book.<br /><br />Read it, love it.
B005NS5CX4|3.0|Liked few songs on it. but got at a great price. I want to thank you for your service to get this album.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|We watched this movie for the first time on a cruise. I missed some of it then so I rented it off Amazon. Plus wanted to watch it with my granddaughter.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I can be a tough critic and held out on this one due to its hype.  It was a solid film that kept the viewer engaged.  I think the historical aspects kept it from feeling too &#34;Hollywood&#34;
B00C2VIA52|4.0|It's a good game so far haven't had to pay for anything yet but still able to progress. So for that a big thumbs up.
B00BR5MJJC|1.0|I do not recommend buying this video. I thought I would save a little money buying a \\"digitally remastered\\" version. This video looks like someone copied the movie off a bad VHS tape.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|fix my game im freeking out.  cant open sense update. my people are dieing!  5 stars when working 0 stars now!!!
B004X6PRO6|3.0|The writing was excellent. I just wish the author was describing something other than man's inhumanity to man, in their own country. Abuse is evil, made worse when it is mandated by their despicable despot, even more abominable when you can't survive without performing the mandated abuse to your fellow man. I suppose being educated to another's way of life/existence is one thing. Gave me horrible nightmares.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers is simply an amazing piece of creativity. Heart felt and moving, a very powerful series. I highly recommend this set. The blu-ray quality is one of the best. The picture and the audio are excellent. At the special of $35 this is a deal you don't want to pass up. If you haven't got this box set and were a fan of the series then this is a must have in your collection. It arrived on time and the package was in great condition. I would recommend this seller.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I did not get to watch this on TV.  This was a series that lived up to the reviews I read.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This is a heartwarming story of the ridiculous treatment by us of slaves. I am so aware of the times and what hard work it was to get through each day. Especially living in elegant surroundings, the dedication of the slaves to their white owners. Fortunately on some of these plantations, the owners were gracious and cared for their charges in a respectful way. Unfortunately, owners of slaves were not gracious, as in this story. The mistreatment of other human beings is a legacy we have to live with. We have no way to change history. A lesson learned would be for all of us to go through our lives treating other people in a respectful manner. I am saddened by our history. I am proud to say I treat all people as if they were me. Each human life is so important in our day to day living. We need to take heed. Of the history we have to live with, knowing we can change for the better, how our lives can be enriched in our treatment of each and every human being.
B007FXLWKW|1.0|A pathetic attempt to transfer the santa clause story to a cute bunny and once again cut Jesus from the holidays created for Him.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|why can't I download this?  it says I can, but then it tells me that it's incompatible with my kindle fire.  it looks really cool, and I LOVE angry birds.  I beat the seasons, regular and Rio.  on my kindle and compy.  why can't I get it???????
B003FBMS4W|3.0|Yes, the scenery is fantastic and there were some interesting outdoor scenes such as the cavalry on horseback crossing an icy river with chunks of floating. But the characters, especially Wayne and his supporting actors, were all caricatures. There were just too many attempts at humor both in dialogue and action, that just weren't that funny.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, there were hints at Wayne's character's racism and perhaps, after searching and finding the abducted girl, he might actually kill her. No, not for a minute did I believe it. In fact, when she is finally &#34;captured&#34; and returned to a white homestead in the last minutes of the movie, Wayne is carrying this grown-up woman (Natalie Wood by the way) as if she were wounded badly (she wasn't). Pure Hollywood.  I love Westerns and rather prefer Burt Lancaster in The Scalphunters.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The story is much more complicated than the special effects.  I may have to read the book now that I have the gist of the story.

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I really like TV more than movies now.  They have the time to really develop the characters and the story.  This story is beautifully film, wonderfully acted and storytelling at its best.
B003VW54QO|5.0|John, Dean, and Ricky may be on the cover, but Angie Dickinson is great as the love interest for John T.  It is one of the &#34;must watch&#34; movies if you're a John Wayne fan.

I was so sad/mad.:(  when after about 3-4 months I decided to try it again and it works perfectly. I don't know how but it does!!!!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I found this book to be a fascinating look at people who push through tragedy, mental illness, and the life that follows.  I don't know how realistic a portrayal it is, but it was interesting to read none the less.<br /><br />Most of all though, I loved the characters- I found them all to be incredibly engaging & interesting.  The characters are what drove the book for me, from beginning to end- wanting to see what they would do next & cheering them on along the way.  It's nice to have a character to root for once in a while.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Glad I got it.  Price was right.  I like the idea it has a carbide element, and ceramic element.  It's easy to use.  I've sharpened an old pockek knife, and scissors with it, and it works well.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|This was a solid ending to a trilogy. I was pleased that the story, rather than the love triangle, was the focus of the book (though some would argue that the love triangle was the story). I also really enjoyed the addition of Hana's perspective on the events of the book- I was initially concerned it would break up the flow of the book, but it didn't. Instead Hana's view of their society added another layer on the already complicated events that we were watching unfold & I thought it added a lot to the book.<br /><br />I think anyone who read & enjoyed the first two will be pleased with the way Requiem wraps up the series.
0385349947|5.0|I really connected with this book. As a mother of two young children and a business owner, I blend and balance my personal and professional life everyday.  This book helped me vindicate myself of the guilt associated with working motherhood and &#34;having it all&#34;.  It also reminds me of the decisions me and many of my female colleagues have made that may have been detrimental to our careers.  It also gave me important lessons for moving forward to avoid gender pitfalls, one example: choosing an appropriate career mentor.  Another, speaking very direct and honestly, in day to day encounters.  Importantly, Sheryl Sandberg comes across as approachable and real throughout each chapter.<br /><br />I have talked about this book with my husband, who tries to comprehend my stress, and in turn, he has stepped up to more chores and duties in our home.  Women, myself included, need to value our sanity and insist our husbands/partners step it up.  It's not fair to us, our jobs and our families if one person is burnt out trying to do it all.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|Nothing a surprise, but Pink forces all of us to admit that we are selling . . . selling something, an idea or a Fuller Brush.  Pink is a good thinker and a good writer . . . for me anyway.  I have come to trust him and purchase his new book without much study.  My field is leadership, change, and future focusing.  Pink always helps me to feel like I am up to date.  He presents simple concepts with relevance to today's world.  Not his most meaningful book for me, but still worth a 4.  Read it if you want to understand yourself better . . . and to learn a few tricks about selling.

B00BKBCF38|4.0|If I really wanted to be nit picky and rate something down, is that Ghost will not be performing any neighboring states where I live at. I'm not stating that is the reason I gave it four stars, but I am envious for anybody who gets to. I saw them once during the Heritage Hunter tour and I absolutely loved what I saw and heard. Once again, Ghost delivers a sequel album that held my attention the first time I listened to it. The mood for Infestissumam is darker with more atmospheric moods, but not trying to go near or over the top like how Cradle of Filth was...or trying to recapture. Almost all of the songs are wonderful with a few that lose their nerve a bit, almost sounding like this would be a monster mash album to play during Halloween. The first album had a few too, but for some reason it was expected because that was their debut(which still blows me away that songs of Satanism sounds more evil than the over saturation of crap metal currently present). Their current single, Year Zero, still stands out the most for some reason even though Per Aspera Ad Inferi can get me chanting along with it. It's a simple tune, but it is very catchy and at the same time sounding very epic to me. Reading the other reviews on here, particularly the low rated ones, just makes me wonder if anybody did listen to music or the metal from the 1970s. I'm pretty sure that Ghost doesn't want to be just or sound like Mercyful Fate. Instead of calling it \\"soft core,\\" metal why don't you go read what King Diamond has to say first? Or I don't know, listen to music from that generation. Not all metal has to have over complicated riffs with some guy growling. To me, Ghost is doing yet another justice to how metal can sound evil and be rocking while being easier to listen to. They are more theatrical than anything like A job for a Cowboy or any other really dumbly named metal band. Also, have any of you 3 to 1 star raters ever watched this band live yet? Judge them after you do.<br /><br />Ghost or Ghost B.C. did not do anything bad with releasing Infestissumam. It's a worthy sequel to an already amazing debut into the current metal scene. The vocals are still clean, beautiful yet haunting, and the guitar and drum work are simple, yet satisfying. I just hope this band doesn't lose their creative juices because Ghost is definitely a band that I could fall back to like I always did with Opeth. Leave it to the Swedes to know how to make music interesting.or Ghost B.C. did not do anything bad with releasing Infestissumam.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I think it is a really good book, I have been enthralled with it since I got it while on vacation. Twists and turns, make it a little difficult to follow, but once you catch on to the pattern of the book, it makes for a great quick read!

B00AHTYI5M|4.0|\\"Argo\\" is a movie trying to decide what kind of movie it wants to be. Political thriller? A satire that compares Hollywood with Washington D.C. (like \\"[[ASIN:B003Y19E4A The Last Shot]]\\")? Or straight based on a true story historical film? It has elements of all but fails to commit to any of them and comes up with a patchwork movie not sure of where it wants to go.<br /><br />After the Iranian revolutionary guard took over the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979, six embassy employees were able to make it to the Canadian Embassy where they were given asylum. Sooner or later the Iranians would discover some Americans made it out of the embassy, so they have to be smuggled out of Iran before they're discovered.<br /><br />Ben Affleck plays (and directs `Argo') Tony Mendez, a CIA operative whose job it is to extricate Americans from foreign countries. His idea is to go into Iran and walk the Americans out in plain sight. He comes up with a cover story that he's a producer of an American movie titled Argo (because the whole world loves American movies), which is a Star Wars science fiction type movie. He enlists make-up man John Chambers (John Goodman, playing another good over the top role since \\"[[ASIN:B00BB8RKH6 Flight]]\\"), and Alan Arkin playing a movie producer. They set up a phony production company in L.A., run phony notices of the impending production, and Mendez heads off to Iran. Once in Iran, Mendez faces the Americans, some of whom are skeptical of the plan and are restitant to it. Mendez convinces them it's the only chance they have and takes them to `scout' Iranian locations for the movie, and then walk them out through the airport under the noses of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.<br /><br />Affleck does a good job handling the dual role of actor/director. There's no splashy performances, the acting is uniformly good. There's some tension at the expected moments in the film such as will the Americans be recognized and/or identified as the missing American Embassy employees? Will their identities be compromised by Iraninan employees of the Canadian embassy? And will they make it safely past the Iranian Revolutionary Guard? Even though `Argo' is based on historical events that (in theory) we already know the outcome of, Affleck ably manifests the tension.<br /><br />`Argo' is a good movie, that is enjoyable and has good acting, but could have been a whole lot better if it had decided early on what kind of picture it wanted to be.Embassy employees?

1572816112|3.0|This was the first deck I bought after a long hiatus from the tarot. After looking through many of the decks that have come out in the past few years, I decided on this one mainly because the art really appealed to me. Combined with all the great reviews and the years of #1 position on Aeclectic Tarot, it seemed like a sure thing. Now, there are things I like about this deck but, unfortunately, after working with it for a while, I am finding that it is just not working for me.<br /><br />I do like the art and characters and I find the style to be really creative and unique. That said, I've found that, for me, they aren't characters that work well in a tarot deck. Similar to a deck that has nothing but animals or mythical creatures, I have found it very hard to relate to them. Their eyes and expressions seem vacant; there's something empty about them. Some people call this a \\"dark\\" deck, but I'm not at all disturbed by it and honestly don't really get how anyone into tarot would be. However, I do feel it has a negative vibe.  A lot of the time it seems like the worst aspect of a given card is portrayed, like many of them depict what I would consider their reversed position aspect. The Hermit is a good example of this in his psychotic, deranged loneliness; I typically really like the Hermit, but this interpretation seems so shallow and such a small part of what the Hermit can be about. Another example is The Emperor, who conveys nothing but arrogance to me. And the entire Pentacles suit just feels like it has a dualistic \\"the material world is evil\\" vibe; the entire element seems to be portrayed as soulless and mechanical. Personally, I have a much different view of Earth as the container of the other elements and of spirit; it is alive and an important means by which we can commune with the divine.<br /><br />Also, although I find them somewhat negative leaning, the characters do generally seem to convey the artist's interpretation of the cards quite well. In a lot of decks it can be difficult to connect the image with the description in the LWB. With this deck, the characters provide the artist's definition of the card very clearly (with the exception of the Courts, which I find very two dimensional). While this sounds like it could be a good thing, I personally prefer depictions that provide a broader spectrum of meaning and allow more personal interpretation. I feel stuck in one particular interpretation of each card and it makes my readings with this deck feel shallow, like the cards are difficult to adapt to various situations.<br /><br />I know this all sounds pretty negative, and maybe seems like this should be a one or two star review, but I recognize that a lot of this just has to do with the cards not resonating with me personally. I've tried to put words to this feeling as best I can, but it really just comes down to a personal preference. And honestly, there are things I like. The Aces, for example, I think are wonderful. And there are various other cards throughout that I really like and directly contradict my general negative impression of the deck (Queen of Wands, King of Wands, 4 of Wands, 10 of Cups, 6 of Cups are some examples). I also think the character design is really unique and creative, even if I don't feel like I can relate to them. Plus, I prefer decks that do have characters depicted on all the pips and this deck is great in that regard. Finally, if you are looking for a beginning deck and you get a good vibe from the cards (you can find pics of just about all the cards using google), then I would say this would be a great deck because you won't need to refer to the book much to get what the card is about. To contradict myself on that point, though, I did look at most of the images online and loved them, but got a very different vibe after actually working with it.

B00797MB0O|5.0|My boyfriend and I went to see this movie not expecting anything.  We were just getting out of the house.  After it was over, we both just sat there and agreed it was the best movie we'd seen all year.  This is SUCH a good movie.  And I'm super picky.  I usually prefer to read a book than watch a movie.  It was touching, and a wonderful story.  I have no idea why all the bad reviews except maybe most people want a Disney fairy tale ending or to watch stuff blow up or see airbrushed naked people.  If you actually like a good story with human connection, it doesn't get better than this.

It was perfectly written for every moment of the movie and perfectly tied in the wonderful visuals with the music. As soon as I got home, the first thing I did was go onto Amazon to look for the MP3 soundtrack. Ir reminded me a lot of one of my favorite scores for a fave movie TRON, also a few elements of THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN and other sci-fi/futuristic movies. It is music I can listen to any time for any mood.  Highly recommended!!

0920668364|5.0|the story of Love you Forever is very special to me. My mom was waiting in the doctors office when my sister was 2 years old finding out she was hearing impaired, while she was waiting she had read my sister this book. My sister now a grown women gave my mom this book for mothers day when she was 16. never owning this book brought tears to my mom's eyes as she was remembering the day in the waiting room. So I received this book when I was pregnant with my first daughter, my mom sent this to me when I was told she was going to be a small baby and they were not sure if it was due to her having health issues or that she was just petite. She ended up just being a petite little girl and age 2 she is 24 pounds but healthy as can be. So this book means a lot to my family and to this day when my 2nd daughter was born I read this book to the girls on a everyday basis.I can relate because it says in the book it feels like she is living in a zoo, someday it feels like that with the terrible two's. You Can't go wrong with this book even as a grown women I still love reading this book. thank you!!!!

They make us ask, &#34;are we living up to our potential?&#34;  I am not saying everyone can be a Gandhi, or even close, but we should still consciously try to be the best person we can.  This movie makes me feel this way.  I ask myself, &#34;am I smart enough, do I try hard enough, is there more I can do.&#34;  Where art inspires, perhaps there is no greater good.

0071762345|5.0|\\"Likeable Social Media\\" is a book which was written by Dave Keppen. Social media is widely known and used nowadays. As the development of social media, many media content and forms can be used at online social media. The increasing number of personal users on online social media websites cause many companies start to using these devices to sell their products. However, the ways of using social media for marketing purpose is different than the personal purpose; many companies failed or cannot achieve their goals when they first touch social media marketing. Therefore, \\"Likeable Social Media\\" is a very useful book for all marketers and companies who like to use social media to extend their business.<br /> Although many marketers believes that social media networks can bring and absorb al lot of customers for them, they still have to do some works for themselves. In the first chapter that I think is the most important point, the author introduces the benefits of listen. Marketers need to listen what their customers say before they selling products to them. After listen, marketers also need to think and act as the way as their customers. They need to follow how their customers think about one particular product first; and then, they need to react and communicate with their customers. Even people are not selling or doing business, they have to listen other people's opinions first just to be respectful.<br /> Using social media fro business does not mean one can successful in this high products flow rate society. There must have some negative or unsatisfied comments on some brands or products. At this point, the author points out that marketers must respond quickly to those negative comments. The reason is that if companies do not respond, they will have high risks of losing customers. The reason is that bad things always spread faster than good ones. To be professional, companies also need to respond to customers who give positive comments about their products. In this way, they can build a long-term customer relationship in order to have loyal customers in the future.<br /> Doing business is not just about sales and communication, it also about companies' quality. The quality in here is not about products, it is about how clear and transparent companies can be in front of their customers. The author suggests that marketers should be authentic and honest to their customers and the market. Just like interacting with friends and families should be honest, companies also need to be honest to their customers. There are a lot of explanations and examples about why companies need this attitude, and it will bring a lot of benefits to companies.<br /> Last but not the least, companies should combine their products, retail store, and online social media into one powerful connected sale line. Social network can be part of brands' selling channel. The author suggests using social media and networks consistently and honestly. In order to attract customers, the author also recommends that providing some interesting, and discount events online.<br /> Social media is a relatively new medium for business world, many companies like to try running their business on it. However, there are also a few problems and matters that marketers should pay attention to. \\"Likeable Social Media\\" is a valuable book that provides a lot of great tips and recommendations for companies. There is no doubt that social media will be the most famous business device in the future.

0307341577|3.0|Alright, kinda lengthy and seemed as if it was just trying to wrap up at the end without a real ending.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|as advertised.  this twenty word limit is driving me nuts.  wish they would do away with it.  so much for concise.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this light romance from start to finish!  It is a great read and I cannot wait to read more from this author!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|There is a tactile nature to this game that constantly surprises me. Every decision made about this game was to its benefit.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|It was great finding Lost the fifth season for a great price! The DVDs came in perfect condition, and the box in great condition! They came right on time, and nothing wrong with them!
B00684J49U|5.0|I own all seasons of Grey's Anatomy and this completes my set. So I am pleased with it as I love the show.
B007N8RULO|3.0|really spider solitaire?  my wife is crazy!  i guess its ok though because it was a free app horray for me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Even though I'm 14 this game is keeping me busy for hours. In a way it is educational, and teaches children money management and what things go good where.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|free app.  this is a free app that I am writing a rating for and i only have 6 words left.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Every time I try to download it , it disappears ! No idea why and it takes like 2 hours just to load!!
B004UID2LC|3.0|thank you for the free app.  thank you thank you.  I hope this free app finds you well have a nice day
0880796863|5.0|So far the cards are  right on I have found out alot on what my day and ? means this dose help out with things going on in my life
B00632HWOG|3.0|this app was free so why do i need to rate it.  this is silly and i want my money back.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very smart I like it but it should have more coins it is the bets game besides temple run it is a tie
B000FA675C|5.0|Super writing!!  Great suspense!!!  In addition, you learn history in a mysterious thriller. Read for yourself and follow the characters as they find the answers.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|I gave it a four because I found it a little slow in places.<br /><br />i found the parts that discuss studies related to running, human and animals very interesting. Quite insightful how animals run compared to humans and how humans can run long distances.<br /><br />It's not just for the ultrarunner, as there is something for all runners.<br /><br />There are amazing stories about very special runners like Tarahumara (Raramuri), Martimano, Victoriano, Manuel Luna, Juan Herrera, Arnulfo, Caballo Blanco, Scott Jurek, Jen Shelton, Billy Barnett, Ann Trason, and Bearfoot Ted to name a few.<br /><br />As a novice runner, this is a book I plan to read again.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My 8 year old put this on her Galaxy after playing it on her Grandma's Kindle.  She loves it!  There are so many levels, it will take her ages to complete them.  Levels range from a 5X5 grid to a 9X9 grid.  The highest levels are challenging for me and my 4 year old can play on the lowest levels.  Works great on both the android and kindle platforms!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This game is so much.  I can't put it down .very entertaining!!<br />Kids and adults will really enjoy this game.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|This 2 CD version has all the songs of the oscar winner movie, including the song nominated for best song.
B0055MBQOM|4.0|Just plug-in and follow the on-screen prompts. Allows measurement of ambient light as well as glare from monitor. Only downside is that calibration takes 5 minutes.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have severe tinnitis which can make it hard to sleep.  There is a nice variety of sounds and the pink noise seems to match the pitch of my tinnitis so I can ignore it.  Very relaxing and really helps me get a better nights sleep.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|We enjoyed it so much that we now want to give it as a gift to a friend... it's simply a heartwarming film
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love this CD!  I am enjoying it so much that I have already pre-ordered Volume 2 that is coming out in May!
0062511408|5.0|If you are learning spanish this is simply the best first short novel that you could read.  The vocabulary is easy, the story is wonderful and draws you in, the chapters are very short and the vocabulary lends itself to word acquisition.  I have recommended or given this book to several students of spanish as a great first book.
B009CF3MEK|3.0|slow, needed more story.  I was hoping for a lot more from Redford.  It was worth the watch.  Looking forward to seeing what DiCaprio does with the role.
B002RV01QI|5.0|Love Enya, something ancient, wonderful and mystical about her sound. Essential Enya..calming, liberating and triumphant...great feeling from her music. Enjoyable.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|There is absolutely no reason why anyone should overlook this watch by Seiko. The Seiko 5 Automatic watch is the perfect accessory for those who either hate paying for and changing your watch batteries too often, or need something that will last with little or no maintenance.<br /><br />Just be sure you are a daily watch wearer or have a watch winder because you will need to set the time very often if it is not activated daily.
B005KELQEU|5.0|My wife & I bought 2 of these sleeves for our Kindle Paperwhites and we're very happy with them.  They are not tight at all, as some other reviewers have said, and we've seen no issue with the zippers.  It's not meant to hold the Kindle while you're reading, just to protect it while it's not in use.  The only drawback we can see is that it only comes in black.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|ok well I hare the host table will not work I hare this much stars or coins or Mony wut  ever they call it 138'142 now I cant make Mont and no customer's. can come in I hade this app for a year and I aunt to kill who ever did this to me I wis crying for ours I. got so mad I slaked the kindle on the floor and almost broke it
B004GYY714|3.0|I would like to listen to my morning  talk show and my R&B Classics & late night Jazz on my Kindle instead of carrying around my laptop.  None of my local radio stations are listed (Baton Rouge and New Orleans, LA)
B00004YRQA|5.0|this thing works just like a new one, I got it used but I still like what a have reseeved.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have played lots of mahjong games.  I rate this as one of the best in my rating system of good, better & best.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I'm not a forecaster, so I Don't need the app for that. But what it does do is help me plan for the day I'm going to have and the weather I will  have to deal with hour to hour.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I Love It!!! A GREAT Romance by A GREAT Author. One of my most favorite books by Nicholas Sparks!! Reads fast you won't want to put it down.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|But I liked it.  The ending leaves you hanging a bit, so I'm assuming there's going to be a sequel.  If so, I'll watch it for sure.
B000FA675C|5.0|A book to have in your library, so that you can enjoy it more than once.  Each time you read it you pick up on more subtleties of the writer. A good read.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love the characters and have always enjoyed period dramas. This  was right up my alley and I was thrilled to find it. They have just enough romance and drama to keep it interesting without the story lines being absurd.
B003O86FMW|4.0|What a great follow-up to the first book. It keeps the games going with your favorite people. I can not wait to read the next one and see the movie
B009HUB40Y|1.0|AWFUL! DID NOT SHOW APPEAR BRIGHT / VERY VAGUE APPERANCE ON MY TABLET SCREEN! WISH I COULD GET A REFUND! A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY!!!!!!!!
B00BF11STU|5.0|I didn't really follow everything that happened when it was all happening. The movie was really good and placed all the events I remember seeing on tv in a timeline. I don't usually like movies like this but, I'm glad I watched this one.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Well, it was a good book for sure, not sure how the second will be. Went from hillbillies In a maze to a post apocalyptic world full of herpe infested sun damaged zombie people... Hmmm
0812416503|1.0|Please note, this review concerns the Avon Books hardcover edition. It is not a  review of the book itself.<br /><br />This classic Daphne du Maurier pot boiler deserves far better treatment than this over-priced, poorly manufactured hardcover pocket edition. Blurred, tiny type on the lowest quality paper and a cut-rate cover (the printing on the back cover isn't even straight!) combine to make this only slightly better than a well-used pocket paperback. Twelve bucks for this?  To paraphrase the second Mrs. de Winter, \\"... luxury has never appealed to me, I like simple things, books, being alone, or with somebody who understands, but this piece of crap was a bloody rip off.\\"
B0086AYAQ6|5.0|Valentina 's virtuosity and and muscianship continues to amaze me.  Selections beautifully played and wonderfully recorded..<br />I purchased her Rachmaninov's Concertos alsowhich were absolutely outstanding.  What a treasure house!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Having read the last five of Nesbo's Harry Hole novels over the past few weeks, I am left exhausted, devoid of adrenaline, wishing there was more, but pleased that I can finally move on and accomplish some useful task. Harry has at last straightened out and pulled himself above his addictions in order to accomplish a task he can't ignore, can't run from, and can not drown in Jim Beam. As soon as you think the answer is clear, that it all makes sense, you are wrong.  If you are new to the series, start at the beginning, it is a worthwhile journey.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|Valentina shows her keyboard mastery on these recordings. Balance between orchestra and piano could have been improved but her playing could not!!
B009VYF5E2|5.0|The characters are growing up and the stories are getting darker. Love the slant on the Merlin tales. Who would have thought to make Merlin the servant to King Arthur,and that they would become such good friends? Have really enjoyed the series every year. Sad there will only be one more season. For anyone who hasn't watched these you probably need to watch at least one of the first 3 seasons to understand where the characters are coming from in their reactions to things presented in the story lines.
B0037W68F4|5.0|Bought this album on release and it still sounds fresh and exciting. Album is Amazing! do i need to say more? no
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I love this series of games...sad that it keeps crashing on my Galaxy SIII. But its hard for me to stay mad at thses little Noms..... but seriously FIX IT.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|How could you not rate Star Wars as a 5 ?! So many discs, so much content, so many extras, so worth it for the price. I love how they are packages also.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|So far so good, still have more to learn about it, taking my time to get it right, ask me again later on.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is a great movie! Well chosen actors and actresses, along with a great story line. Although it is kinda of a fairy tale love story I think a lot of people can relate to it.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|My 4-year-old daughter loved spelling words on the start screen. The challenges were fun for me. This is a fun game for both of us.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|After reading for some time I deleted the book from the Kindle. At 90 years I found that the actual information was too busy outlining the sexual happenings and difficult to follow the trend of the opening of WWI.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This was sad to see James Bond made out to be flawed. When Sean Connery played Bond in his later years he was not made to look old and weak. It was also odd to see Q played by a kid and with no technical gadgets for bond. I just think they could have did a better job.
B008602KQI|4.0|It is a good but not great movie.<br />It did follow the book reasonably well.<br />Will see the next movie just to see how good it is.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Highly anticipated. Well worth the wait and money good album all the way through!  No need to hit the skip button!  Different than all the same garbage currently on the radio.  He took it to another level.  Completely pleased!  Strong Timbaland presence.  Mid-90's early 00's Timbo!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Can't move wallpaper around to \\"redecorate\\", but game is simple yet addicting. Tables and chairs cost too much for as many as needed.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am 25 days in and although i have not lost any weight, my whole body has shrunk and tightened. I decided to stick with workout 1 until i could do it without stopping. I can say it has taken me this long to do so. It does get  a little boring but im looking forward to level 2 after my 30 days is up. I have never seen my body make such big changes so quickly. Like most of you, i want results  and i want them fast. I felt this on day one and still feel it on day 25. I am a working mom of 2 so 20 minutes is just the right amount for me to squeeze in each day. I am proud of myself and proud of this video. I am a Jillian fan through and through!! Buy this and start feeling GREAT!!!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Great read! I enjoy that the series is different from the show.  The only problem I have is that I would have enjoyed color instead of black and white. It was still good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game for all lovers of temple run and other such games.I highly recommend it to others because it never gets old and they are always coming out with new content and new characters to unlock. The new characters and boards cost just enough to keep you playing but not enough to make you feel as if you will never unlock them. Also the characters that are always available can be very hard to unlock but you have no time limit to get them so you have to save up money to get them which can be challenging. The fun part is the game, it gets progressively harder and faster which can make it hard to get too far.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I thought the book had a great beginning and the ending was<br />Awesome. I think it is also cool that Jason is called the son of Jupiter instead of Zeus.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|A lot of the tunes on the Skydog retrospective are familiar, having been released in previous Hourglass and Allman Brothers Band records, along with the two Duane Allman Anthologies. HOWEVER, there are a lot of unreleased songs from The Escorts days, along with other more obscure studio guitarist appearances previously unheard. Ad in some previously unreleased photographs and liner notes written by Duane's daughter, and you have a COMPLETE retrospective. This is for the hard core Duane Allman fan. It chronicles his development as a guitarist, and, having been named the #2 guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine, that goal has been met.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|A new work and just a little bit old... I appreciate David Bowie and his music from a long time.
B0018BF1LS|3.0|I was pretty young when Jefferson Airplane showed up so I heard their music for most of my life until they faded away.<br />This box set was priced right to get the whole catalog so I went ahead and picked it up.<br />No matter how good the remastering may be, there is only so much that can be done with these old recordings.<br />While the sound may be better than it ever has been, that does not mean its really good.<br />When this band started out everything was in mono, nothing any band could do about that situation but after listening to real stereo for all these years these old recordings are not up to par.<br />I guess I should have just kept on remembering Jefferson Airplane fondly, the songs used to be cutting edge but now they are just OK and very dated.<br />The music used to be 'cool' and it probably still is... but I am not... LOL
1613823649|4.0|This is my first reading of Chesterton and I was not dissapointed. You may get lost in some of his poetic assertions, but dont let that discourage you. The bits of wisdom and spiritual truths that you pick up are more than worth your time.<br /><br />Chesterton does not set out to write an apologetic but rather a memoir on how he came to believe. What most impressed Chesterton was how the paradoxes of life were best explained by the christian faith. For instance Chesterton argues that the pure optimist whitewashes the world that he may love it, christian optimism loves the world so much that he is willing to burn it.<br /><br />The challenge of the new atheists today are a re-treading of what Chesterton faced at the dawn of the 20th century. In sheer brilliance Chesterton makes the argument that \\"madness, is the absence, not of reason, but of imagination\\" (introduction XI). And then \\"the madman is not the man who has lost his reason. The madman is the man who has lost everything except his reason.(page 11)<br /><br />Writing about 100 years ago, Chesterton says this about the skeptics of his day; \\"The new rebel is a skeptic, and will not entirely trust anything. He has no loyalty; therefore he can never really be a revolutionist. And the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants to denounce anything. For all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind; and the modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces, but the doctrine by which he denounces it.\\"(page 33)<br /><br />Christianity has grinded down the axes of a thousand armies, mine included. This is because of men like Chesterton who really thought through the importance of life's hardest questions.
B000005RXH|3.0|I have most of the Supertramp catalog so I decided to go ahead and get this CD along with Supertramp.<br />I have never heard either of these before and after giving them a listen I find it absolutely amazing that the third effort produced Crime Of The Century.<br />If you like the sound of Crimes Of The Century and later efforts there is not going to be very much to like on this album.<br />There are only hints of the greatness to come, and those are few and far between.<br />The previous reviews on this album are split, so if you disagree that is fine.<br />If you are unfamilar with this album I do not recommend spending your money on it.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I'm not a fan of games, and this was no exception.<br />Probably people who enjoy games would have a different opinion
B000007491|2.0|I have most of the Supertramp catalog so I decided to go ahead and get this CD along with Indelibly Stamped.<br />I have never heard either of these before and after giving them a listen I find it absolutely amazing that the third effort produced Crime Of The Century.<br />There are only the smallest hints of the greatness to come buried deep here.<br />Everyone is entitled to their own opinion so all I have to say about the 4 & 5 star reviews is that I respectfully disagree.<br />Actually I am surprised they got a third chance.<br />If you really like the sound of the six hit albums and have not heard this, I recommend spending your money on something else.<br />If you are like me and want to round out the Supertramp catalog, I recommend spending your money on something else.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|I thought this movie was great fun, and no one does Batman like Michael Keaton.  Michelle Pheiffer was very good and pretty evil as well.  And, one could almost feel sorry for Danny DeVito's character -- almost.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I bought this as a girl I worked with had an issue with her Wii. I bought one and when our second shift guy got to play with the kit, he bought one, then our first shifters opted to get one too!
B002ZG98UA|4.0|This is an interesting series.  I don't know if this was the inspiration for The Walking Dead since zombies have been around (?) forever, but it is a great tale.  Jovovich is wonderful as Alice.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I do not usually buy albums in his genre even when I enjoy a sing or two from a band. I bought this as a gift for someone and ended up really enjoying the music.
0790734850|5.0|James Ellroy wrote a great tale which was brilliantly portrayed.  The excellent performances were too numerous to mention, but in particular, Russell Crowe was very good.
B008602KQI|4.0|Thrilling and leaves you hanging at every turn. The plot was a little weird but the movie was well made. I would recommend to anyone interested in sci-fi thrillers.
B000E33W1W|5.0|How can one say anything else about Ghostbusters but wonderful?  The guys were wonderfully nerdy, unlikely heroes.  Bill Murray was as swarmy as only he can be, and the tale was fun.  Great movie.
B005B19UPE|5.0|Bought for a friend.  Have already read it.  It was so wonderful I wanted my friend to read it without parting with my own.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Great movie, with a great ending, despite all of the naysayers. No politics.  No BS.  Just a great job on a great story.
B00684J49U|5.0|Love this show......not all the changes and cast kill off's.....Just watched 1st episode<br />Myjob doesn't allow me that much TV time
B002NZK5TG|5.0|What a great tale!  The entire cast shines in this musical, from Moranis and Martin.  The music is great, the acting is superior, and the story is just fun.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Pilot episode really well done! I can see there's lots of potential for this series to be the new \\"Game of Thrones\\"... only Better!!!
B004SIP7QC|5.0|I thought this was going to be a prequel to Peter Pan.  I'm very glad I was wrong.  Depp does a great job as James Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan, and Winslet's detractors will just have to live with it.  She was great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book 2 being my favorite of the three. I wasn't crazy about how book three ended, I guess I'm almost alone on that, and book 1 was great and left you desperate for this one, and it delivers. I love the excitement of a good trilogy and this one was a great one after The Girls with the Dragon Tattoo!
B001CTGQBK|5.0|What a great musical presentation of the 50s!  I loved this movie when it came out, and it just gets better. The entire cast shines and it's just a fun musical.
1452123071|5.0|My husband is a SW fan and when I saw this book, I decided to give as a present to both him and my 3 year old son. As much as the adults have enjoyed this book, my kids - we also have a 5 year old girl - seem to be a little too young for it. We love it though, and I have pre ordered the &#34;daughter&#34; version, too!
B0006L0LOS|4.0|This was an interesting presentation of Catwoman.  I remember watching Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar on the old series as well as Michelle Pheiffer in Batman Returns, so this version caught me a little flat footed.  Even so, I thought the movie was worth watching and an intriguing presentation.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|I took my daughter, then 4, on a girl's &#34;night&#34; out to the theater to see this movie. I have to say that I enjoyed it very much, as I do anything that is Dr. Seuss related, but I will hold that day forever in my heart as a very special occasion, because when I turned to look at her cute little face as the movie was ending, tears were rolling down her cheeks as she looked at the screen in awe. She understood it was a happy ending, but she also understood how sad that story was for the trees. And that was  a great moment as a mother.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This case is sturdy and it provides a good fit for the kindle fire.  I love the colour of this case. Very nice. Satisified with this product.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I remember as a child, renting it from the video store and checking it back out several times in a roll! I played it for my kids (then ages 3 and 4) they loved it and it was wonderful to make new memories. So glad Disney decided to give a chance and bring it out in blu ray, because this is a great classic that is often forgotten.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have gotten hooked on this series.  Really good!  Recommend it to everybody.  Great history and character development.  Give it a try.
159448385X|5.0|It is a very powerful book and get ready to use a few tissues. It just reminds us that we have it pretty good where we live, and even in our most difficult times as people and as a country, we are still lucky.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Can't imagine why this movie got rave reviews. Poorly constructed plot, not logical and just an opportunity to convey violence.
B008X6JP3G|5.0|Awesome movie! Kevin Costner does a great job in this movie. The story line kept your interest.  I would have preferred a different ending
0307454541|5.0|this is one of the most intriguing and page turning books I've ever read. The whole trilogy is fantastic and will suck you in fairly quick so be sure to have the following book available shortly before you finish one because you are going to want it badly!!
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|Ghost on Ghost is a masterpiece.  I haven't been able to stop listening to it since I first got it on April 16.  It makes my heart come alive in a way that's only ever happened to me a few times before with music (most notably by The Decemberists' The Hazards of Love and Doves' The Last Broadcast).  It's different than the earlier stuff, but that by no means takes away from it at all - just goes to show what a true and versatile genius Samuel Beam really is. I've always loved Iron and Wine but man, oh man is this album really something.  It is truly a listening experience - while I usually enjoy listening to music as background while working, reading, cleaning, etc, I have found that I keep getting distracted from whatever else I am doing when I try to multitask while listening.  Absolutely gorgeous.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Peter Pan has been a favorite in my house for a while and I was ever so happy to get the Blu Ray edition. If you, like me, has been slowly switching from dvd to blu ray, be sure not to miss this one. The older the movie, the biggest the difference you see.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Outstanding movie, Daniel Craig is quite possibly the best Bond yet. The fight scenes are quite epic; the one guy gets mauled by several komodo dragons.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I don't have a blu-ray player, but I really hate the idea of buying content these days only in DVD format (compaired to HD, it's pretty bad) This option fit the bill perfectly! Got the DVD for playback now, have the Blu-ray for ripping later, and have the digital copy so we can put it on anything we want. I'm also a big fan of this movie, great story, it'll probably make you cry.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|How would you think I would rate it? 5 stars, picture and quality is great too -  I had no problems
1250027624|5.0|On my goodness!  After buying all three seasons, I can't wait for the next one.  This reference book is well written and gives you the background on the character motivations and how the actors portray them.  It's a quick and excellent read for those DA lovers out there.  Highly recommend it!
B0083SBM7Q|4.0|I love the movie, but I specifically bought the DVD and Blu ray combo to get the deleted scences when, to my chagrin, the deleted scenes were nowhere to be found on the DVD.  I read the back of the box to find out that they are only on the blu ray and I dont have a blu ray player or PS3 or anything.  I'll be taking this one to a friends house to see this stuff but I am very dissappointed in the misinformation that this product puts forth.
B009LGO88E|5.0|This accessory makes it so much easier to enjoy MHTU. I strongly recommend picking it up ASAP, beats using the touch screen d-pad any day.
1476733953|5.0|This series is brilliant. You picked up Wool 1 for free and are pondering buying the 1-5 and 6-8 collections. Do it. Period. This series is like an adult version of the schoolkid classic The Giver only, well, underground. It offers us all a mirror, a warning,  and a hope for ourselves. It is gripping. Editing is flawless. Shifts in location and time are handled not only well but in a nicely interrelated way. Characters are developed well. This series has everything except a mass printing for those who prefer paper and a movie for us all. I have a degree in English,  and honestly these are as well done as they get. Do not hesitate. Collect them all and join us in the silos. You will never be the same.
0091884594|5.0|I love the tips in this book and in understanding your child's nature.  I only wish she had tips for dealing with twins--particularly with two differently natured ones!
B008M721MS|5.0|i love skype and i love the cameras and all my friends are on it so i love it i think its great
B005LAIIJY|4.0|For me Quentin Tarantino is always hit or miss. But this movie is  a totally hit!  Great acting.  Great action. Great plot.<br /><br />His Oscar for best original screenplay was well deserved!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game, I love horses but I don't have one. It's like having a real horse! I recommend this cool download to any person.
0393064476|5.0|I started this book because I was interested in learning about how the writings of Ancient world were recovered and used to inspire the Renaissance.  Exploring Epicurean philosophy was less important.  I thoroughly enjoyed Greenblatt's description of how the Roman texts were recovered.  But to my surprise, I found Greenblatt's take on the spread of Epirucrean philosophy to be the more interesting of the two subjects.  I'm not sure whether \\"De rerum natura\\" was as influential as Greenblatt makes it out to be.  Neverhtless, Lucretius' poem feels very modern and from today's vantage point, the work still seems fresh and relevant.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|Must buy for any hip hop fan. If your an eminem fan or rocye59 ethier way thier both amazing on this album and compliment each others skills
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Excellent five star rating. This series is well documented for historical purposes of clothing and tools. Places they visit and plunder
B009H7SCMA|5.0|'Gabriella'is a love story with a different twist.  It is a funny and entertaining story when Gabriella meets the boy of her dreams at a cricket match.  There is much punning humor and risque metafors.  It is totally unbelievable but  definately entertaining.  I give it five stars.
B00BD62X14|4.0|I've not heard Carla Bruni before but tried this out of curiosity, half expecting to hate it.  I didn't.  It's not a classic by any means but it's a decent enough listen with some atmospheric moments.<br /><br />The thing is, I've been a bit of a sucker for a slightly husky female French voice singing over an acoustic guitar ever since falling hopelessly in love with Françoise Hardy as a young teenager in the 60s.  Now, as a singer Bruni is no Françoise Hardy, and as a songwriter she's certainly no Jaques Brel and but the effect of these well-named Little French Songs is enjoyable and rather evocative.  The whole album to me conjures up black-and-white shots of a solitary young woman in a Biba-style mac looking sadly introspective at a pavement caf&eacute; table or walking away from the camera down a deserted and preferably leaf-strewn Paris street.  You get the idea - and really only have to look at the cover to see what Bruni is aiming at here.<br /><br />Bruni's voice isn't a great one but she uses it very well, sticking largely to its stronger lower register and some half-spoken asides which are effective and intimately atmospheric.  I found the individual songs pretty forgettable (even Le Pingouin, the -shock! - attack on her husband's political opponent) and I'm not sure how often I will take this album out and play it in the future, but it's a lot better than I'd expected and would make enjoyable, relaxing background music if nothing else.  Four stars is perhaps a little generous, but only three seems churlish - 3.5 really, rounded up.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Gods and awesome don't really go together in this book,there is something suspitios going ony and Leo,Jason and piper don't know what yet!read this book if you are interdicted in Greek myths and gods
0345803485|4.0|Extremely erotic but at the same time repetative which is ironic.There was a surprise ending.I think you will enjoy it if you like erotic fiction.
B000WMFZMY|3.0|This film has the feel of two films. The first - the portion prior to the Intermission -is a meandering, unfocused soap-opera in which characters revolve through Charlton Heston's door in highly episodic, over-wrought cameos. It has the feel of a 60s -70s epic (\\"The Longest Day\\" comes to mind) in which a potpourri of marquee stars pass rapidly before you in an effort to assure them of their screen time. However, these \\"stars\\" were hardly marquee and their characters did little to develop the story. It is poorly plotted and paced. (Yes, plotted. Although ostensibly a historical film, it bears little resemblance to what is actually known about \\"The Cid.\\")Worse, action abounds, but motivations are rarely clear. It is a drowsy time.<br /><br />The second half is much more fun.  The story line tightens significantly and Charlton Hesston's acting soars. His performance during the humiliation of King Alfonso and the capture and subsequent defense of Valencia is Shakespearean, absolutely worthy of the great Olivier.<br /><br />I give the first half two stars, the second five, an average of 3.5, which I must, reluctantly, round to 3 because the first half  takes more air time than the second.

B00BG08FKK|5.0|I love the music - listen to it every day going to and from work.  I have the 25th anniversary but this is so full of feeling/emotion.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|If you like Quentin! WATCH THIS MOVIE! it takes a little getting used to the but has a very dry humor which some will love.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have the original movie, also the version from a few yearsf ago, the 25th anniversary DVD and now this DVD.  This is by far the best.  It fills me with emotion each time I watch it.  I recommend this to all Les Miserables lovers.
B003UYV08E|5.0|What can I say about Robert Downey Jr. he is a renaissance man.  He truly can play any role.  He has come back from such adversity to become the consumate actor.  This is another winner in the series.
B0055S348W|1.0|I spent more time that I really wanted to trying to make this work.  I am still not able to print from my tablet.  Perhaps it works but you can't prove it by me.
0399157565|4.0|I was tired of pushing for Kay to get a backbone.  She let her niece be the heavy all too often.  And she didn't speak up when she should have.  At last, she gets a backbone.  Much more interesting character again.
B009LGO88E|5.0|This piece of equipment is great for playing games like Monster Hunter 3 or if you have large hands and find that you feel cramped playing on your XL. The Japanese version works fine with U.S. 3DS.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So much fun!!!!!  You will become addicted for sure.  Wish you did not have to buy more coins to keep playing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you're tired of reading books where you can figure out the entire plot less than 10 pages this is the book to fix that. Well written and entertaining throughout.
B003L77G6A|5.0|The show was good from the start but it only seems to get better as time goes by. I would highly recommend this show to any and all who find nerdy humor to be where it's at.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good time filler game.  Requires mental problemsolving with simple gestures on the screen.  Size format great for kindle.  Much better than on smartphone.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|If you like vintage video game reference jokes, or amusing characters, etc. Than this is one of disney's finest movies to date. And best of all they didn't need pixar to save their hides again.

B00C7JG0KG|1.0|The fact that the studio is not putting the 3D version in with the 2D version is absurd. An offensive cash grab. Its ok to charge a few dollars more for a version with 2D and 3D discs, bc seeing a film in 3D is not worth THAT much. What if i dont own a 3D tv but my friend does? This means that i cant have both versions, one to watch at my house and one to watch at my friend's. No, not unless i wanna spend $63 for both!! Plus, lots of ppl with both tv types dont wanna be stuck with just ONE version. What if some ppl in the house cant watch 3D due to eye/head issues?? I guess they need to spend $63???? Disney, youre DISGUSTING!!
B0094OLFUW|5.0|I'm a fan of The xx and love this album.  Very chill and hip beats and rifts.  Get it today!

B009AMANH4|5.0|This movie is a very factual interpretation of the events leading up to the 13th ammendment and the passing of said ammendment. Very well done.
0307352153|5.0|I grew up in a military family and attended 13 schools before I graduated from high school.  Extroverted behavior was a necessary survival skill, and I laughed the first time someone told me I was probably an introvert.  I loved this book for helping me to understand the positive side of who I really am--who I was designed to be, and who I want to be.  I can highly recommend it.
B00AEFXL5W|5.0|This is an all-time favorite of mine and a classic. I will watch it over and over. The quality of the reproduction was excellent.
1401323820|3.0|In my opinion this book doesn't really merit three stars from a literary standpoint, but it shines as memorabilia from a fun show and generates lots of laughs.  I haven't regretted my purchase.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Being a Lord of the Rings fan, I was very pleased when the first book of the series, The Hobbit, was made into a movie. It was very good but anticlimactic after the Lord of the Rings series. I did enjoy the movie very much though.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|The plot of this book won't surprise you...but in his normal fashion, Mr. Sparks  will pull you into the lives of Amanda and Dawson and as you read you will cry and you will smile and you will wait for the book to come out in movie form! Such bittersweet stories he weaves.
0143119680|5.0|The stories within the story, the characters, all of it.  I didn't want it to end.Can't wait to continue with the next in the series.  I was a big twilight fan but I think this is right up there!
B0002BO05S|5.0|One of the best renditions of Jesus life I have ever seen and very well done even by todays standards!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Although there are other apps that can open/read PDF files out there, the classic Adobe reader does it natively and without glitches (usually).  I only wish that I could edit documents with it on my kindle fire.  Still, recommended...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great book you should  read it Suzanne Collins is a great book author just read it please
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Not exactly what life is at 40, but not a bad watch. Some funny moments, but I expected more from an Apatow movie.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|While this may not be the most appropriate way to have a relationship, I found it to be filled with the hope of real love.  I needed something that was light-hearted and funny to watch.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Django &#34;Freeman&#34; is another entry on a long list of dynamic and impossibly bad-ass Quentin Tarantino characters.  The story of Django and Dr. Schultz is amazing and SO WELL ACTED!  Cristoph Waltz is incredible and his Oscar for this role is spot-on and well deserved.  Jaime Foxx totally embodies the character of a freed slave who now gets paid to kill (evil) white people, as they hilariously mention a few times in the movie.  Tarantino's cameo is pretty awesome, too.  And his random Aussie accent was impressively accurate!  :)  Some of the scenes were tough for me to watch.  Some because they were very graphic and bloody (duh, Tarantino) and others because it was hard to be faced with such a realistic depiction of what slave life must have looked like.  Loved it loved it loved it.  Watch it.  You won't be sorry.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I don't read that much but I wanted something to read during my vacation without lugging around a heavy book. So I purchased a Kindle Fire' downloaded the Kindle app and purchased a book to read. It was so easy. I'm 66, so seniors should not shy away from this technology.
B003ELY7PG|4.0|Although you don't learn crazy new things you didn't think about, this is a pretty good book if you want to create your startup.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game id pretty cool it does sometimes have technical glitches but other than that its great if my opinion even matter's I would say if you want a game that will keep you entertained and on your toes download temple run 2 and plus the graphics are GREAT.
B00005RFVJ|5.0|I do wish the track, Beyond the Sea, was on here, but the rest is lovely!  My boyfriend and I danced to it as soon as he put it on!
B000FA5STS|4.0|I am a fan of David Baldacci! The story line was intriguing and it was a quick read that held my attention to the end.
B008Q0CO0U|4.0|Some good action and plot.  It is worth the time it takes to watch it.  Go ahead and watch it.
B00B2TUKI0|4.0|Another great album from my favorite jazz singer who can smoothly cover old tunes from other genre's seamlessly! This lady is a true talent and gift to the music industry!

B000002AZ8|5.0|When VITALOGY was created, back in the early 90´s, the previous 2 PEARL JAM albums were HUGE classics....TEN and VS are among the best music ever.....VITALOGY changed a bit the PEARL JAM great HEAVY ROCK...They started to do a much more PUNK ROCK sound with more ballads....The PEARL JAM ballads are great like GARDEN, BLACK or DAUGHTER, but i think the furious HEAVY ATTACK they have in other songs to be more intense....By now i hear the greatness of songs like SPIN THE BLACK CIRCLE, LAST EXIT, NOT FOR YOU and CORDUROY, and the ballads on VITALOGY are nice like BETTER MAN.....well, like ALL the first 5 albums from the great PEARL JAM, this is for me now a MASTERPIECE!!!! PEARL JAM was a gifted band and VITALOGY ROCKS!!!!!
B009AMANBA|5.0|enjoyed watching the movie...daniel day lewis was  an excellent  portrail  of Lincoln in the movie...the history in the movie was the closes to the truth as i have ever seen in some of the cilvil war movies...held my interest..found it enjoyable and as well as entertaining...suggest anyone should see it buy renting or buying it...
B001EOOQF6|5.0|MOB RULES is one of the best albums from the legendary BLACK SABBATH, and it says A LOT.....I think this one and HEAVEN AND HELL are among the best music EVER!!!! DIO DID A GREAT JOB WITH SABBATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!
B00002SSKI|5.0|I just love this movie!  It brings back so many memories from growing up.  You can relate to each character in some way.  Great girls night movie!
B0045DO8LK|5.0|I think YIELD is the last MASTERPIECE from one of my favorite bands, the great PEARL JAM!!!! YIELD is a album i can listen to ALL the songs.....i think it´s better than their previous pearls VITALOGY and NO CODE....YIELD got gems like NO WAY, GIVEN TO FLY, BRAIN OF JFK, PILATE, WISHLIST, LOW LIGHT and the HUGE HIT DO THE EVOLUTION(One of the coolest songs EVER!).....This is a MASTERPIECE!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! PEARL JAM ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|wow! this is the best poster i have ever bought, the princesses are just the right size for my daughter's room, she loves them so much, the only bad thing about it is that they peel off them selves but its no big deal because i just press them back and it becomes good again, i gave it a five star because they are so beautiful, and my daughter loves it.
B000025QLX|5.0|WOW!!!! NO CODE is one of the best albums from the great PEARL JAM!!!!! I can listen to ALL the songs like HAIL HAIL, SOMETIMES, SMILE, HABIT, OFF HE GOES and the fantastic ones WHO YOU ARE and RED MOSQUITO.....NO CODE RULES!!!!! It´s almost in par with their TEN)VS ones!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is a great CD.  If your a fan of Andrea Bocelli  you will love this CD.  Also if you are not familiar with this great vocalist, you'll become a fan.
B0014YVCDK|5.0|PEARL JAM is truly a gifted band, and after many years i think BINAURAL is another great album filled with nice songs.....It´s hard to compare what Pearl Jam created after their first 2 masterpieces(TEN and VS)...ALL their stuff goes from great to AMAZING, and BINAURAL grows on you with gens like NOTHING AS IT SEEMS, GOD´S DICE, GRIEVANCE and BREAKERFALL!!!!
B00AYR2FOI|3.0|I was hoping for another fave album from Boz. It's good stuff but the new songs aren't THAT great and the revisits to old faves really don't offer any noticeable improvements or additions. I like the CD but won't ever give up my other oldie!
B00ACBN9CI|1.0|in order to fly your plane you haft to swing your tablet around in the air and if you let go your tablet will break
B00B97SNJI|5.0|Didn't think I could like a CD as much as I liked their last one, but Dawes did it. Great stuff--good tunes, awesome lyrics, and for those who love music that has something to say, something to learn, this could very well be your new favorite band.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Played on KF hd no probs. Nice and long. Agreed to the nice touch of Monaco or HO. Sure wish these developers would do games other than scary but you get what you get and this is one of the better ones. Not gruesome or gross. Can't say much other than worth the money.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Love this guy and his music. I'm enjoying his melodies, his great song transitions, his lyrics, and am falling in love with the blues all over again.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Heath ledger makes the movie. Just got the joker dx11 2.0 action figure as well. It looks just like heath ledger from the movie. Its kind of eerie. Now I just need the batman 1:6 scale action figure. I like the darker Batman movies with Christian Bale. Not corny like the other Batman flicks before Batman begins.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Again, don't know why I need to rate this product as it is a free download and not comming from Amazon.  Hmmm oh well, I highly recommend this product if you have a twitter account and into on line social media conversations.
B00005R24K|1.0|When I got this one I put it in my DVD player and it plays for about 10 seconds. I would like to return it but I am not sure how to do it?
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I have this item on my Ipad and it works.  It does the job since I microsoft office is not available for the Ipad or anyother e-reader not provided by Microsoft.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I just loved this book. It is a very long time since I have laughed out loud and this book did just that, made me laugh out loud! It was a wonderful read.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is a very good product for reading documents on line and printing as well.  I think this item is on all computer for free download so I am not sure why I am rating this item.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great, from beginning to end I was enticed by all the characters. A lot of unexpected turn of events, kept me on my feet.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I purchased this book for my 5 year old grand daughter.  She really enjoyed reading this book and it has become one of her favorite books.  In fact, my 4 year old grand son is now reading this book.  I wish to thank the author for writting such an exciting book for young kids.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|GREAT SHOW I LOVE WATCHING THIS ON MY IPAD THANKS A.I.V. I LOVE BEING ABLE TO GO BACK AND WATCH SOME OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS
B00008WT5J|4.0|If you are like me and despise the hip hop, pop, no talent acts that are flooding the market and airwaves with junk, throwaway music then do your self a favor and invest in this album.  Your ears will thank you.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Thought about this movie the other day and looked it up just for kicks.  Glad I did.  Wanted it for the actors and have an old tv set-up so can't really comment on video quality.  Got what I wanted.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|This movie may be just right for none of the population.  Director was looking for the most bizarre shots imaginable.  The director achieved this objective.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|I think Stargate is the next &#34;StarTrek&#34; in fandome. It has all the componants of great series Sci-fi and has fresh relatable characters.
0812983459|5.0|This book was an easy read yet had many thoughtful messages within the story.  Harold learned a lot about himself and his lfe  and humanity in general.  Very enjoyable book.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I love this movie and appreciate the 2 disc special edition. There isn't really anything else to say about it.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|In true Rush fashion they change things up in this new album.  This one is a little harder than some of the other albums but the lyrics are still top of the food chain.
0786948523|5.0|Very happy with the 4th edition books. Can't wait to start dm-ing games. One day need to get the support books.
0316228532|1.0|I usually don't hate a lot of books but, this is one that I really disliked. I found no redeeming value in this book.
B0041D843M|5.0|These are both very interesting and positive studies. Something everyone should read, and certainly health care providers. The science is there, easy to read,. Anyone who reads who doesn't see need to change their eating and dieting is just in denial!
B000AP04MO|5.0|classic movie with the star in my  opinion is the 1951 MG TD...love this movie an the  score...love it ...yes
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Spent to much time competing for bad jokes and very short on action. I don't read these novels to hear a character blow smoke through out the entire book, I read for entertainment. This does not compare well to his past efforts, and I have read them all.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Every kid should watch this movie. It's okay to explain that this is a human's idea of what all the &#34;Guardians&#34; are like, but it helps explain why some kids get $5 from the Tooth Fairy and another gets $.50! It brings Jack Frost into the discussion and that is awesome when you live where there is real winter :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The writing is so succinct.  I love to watch it over & over but sometimes it's gut wrenching.  Maggie Smith is a hoot!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I'm addicted to this CD. So is my 5-year old. We love the big band sound and for $7 you can't go wrong!
1847879071|4.0|I was looking to brush up on statistics and found the 2nd edition of this book in my local library. I liked the style and the use of frequent, quirky examples. I decided to purchase the 3rd edition so I could have this at home as a reference.<br /><br />Some of the material in the later chapters is outside my expertise, but I'm going to push myself to read onwards and learn as much as I can. The author's sense of humor is engaging as are the real life examples.
B008GBCMHO|5.0|I love getting movies off Amazon! My 2 year old watches aristocats at least once a day. The quality of the movies is great, andthey never lag or slow down. Aristocats is a great movie for people of any age.
B009X01ELC|5.0|This case is well made, durable and attractive. The option of viewing potrait or landscape allow viewing of select web sites at their best. Great price too.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|The best book I've ever read, lot's of twist and turns the people are installing,  There is some love.....  it is good you most read it :-)
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Very entertaining. The actors are great. They really capture you. It's a show about the dark ages in history & it's quite entertaining. Can't wait till the next episodes.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This game was AWESOME!!!!!!!!! Im totally getting the isreal version this game is a must have for fighter pilot enthusiasts

B0063IH60K|5.0|Been playing for a while. Have not seen any glitches and I enjoy this game! Highly recommended! FUN TO PLAY!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome survival and creative and amazing sounds and graphics. The price is high but with out a doubt worth it! On kindle search pocket inv editor and get it so u can change to survival to creative and yes get both apps totally worth it! AGREE
0312335164|5.0|I read this some time ago & have been looking for the hardback so as to keep it in my &#34;special&#34; collection.  All of Dan Brown's books are fast moving & compelling.
0061122416|3.0|The book was somewhat predictible.  It was a fast read but I think it's just not &#34;my kind of book&#34;.  If you're into this type of subject, its not a bad read.  It didn't &#34;change my life&#34; though.
0761163808|4.0|I first saw this book at Costco but didn't buy it.  Later, when I decided it would make a perfect gift for a certain child about to visit, I had to search, but I prevailed & will be presenting it soon.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Very interesting movie about Lincoln and how he worked to persuade members of Congress to pass the Amendment to end slavery.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|There are a number of great concepts here about the power of checklists in our complex world, but the one major take-away is the necessity for checklists for tasks done routinely by experts.  Of course the focus is on critical tasks involving safety, for example.  But still, that is a new paradigm.  We tend to think that experts do not need this kind of tool for routine tasks.  But the world has changed considerably, with the tasks being performed in complex, dynamic situations where something important can easily be overlooked.<br />Beyond that, the author is a wonderful story-teller! The examples are fascinating.  This is a fun read.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|Should have know what I was getting.  Even though most people hated Cody Horn I found her terrible acting entertaining.
0307744434|5.0|I never write online reviews. But for this book I just had to. It was a stunning story. Exactly what escapism into a  novel should be. Some prior reviewers wrote that there was too much descriptive writing. Pish pish. The description serves the story completely and doesn't cross over into indulgence. This really is a stunning debut for Ms. Morgenstern. What an intricate web of characters and circumstances. Enjoyed it thoroughly.
B009NXAMW6|4.0|This movie probably would have gotten five stars from me when it was first released.  Since then, other movies have done similar things with the plot (don't want to give it away), so it wasn't quite as surprising.  Still, it was a great movie, great players, great plot.  Some of the &#34;romantic&#34; dialogue was irritating to me ... forced and fake, but that's a really small part of the story.  Great movie.  Highly recommended for those who like psycological thrillers.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|The selectons on this CD are great for relaxing during a romantic evening of jazz music, a loving companion and fine wine.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I would watch this movie over, and over, and over and over and over....you get the point. Good acting, Good Movie. two thumbs up.
B00006J9OT|4.0|I really enjoy the fast tempo jazz in the selections on this CD.  \\"Live in Paris\\" would make a wonderful gift for anyone who loves jazz.
B005LJITS0|5.0|If i could think of an object and bam there it is, that would be both cool and scary. I would be leaning toward the cool part though
B006PAZMMK|4.0|While each individual track takes you on trip into the electronic realm of Skrillex, yet, the entire album is fairly short.<br /><br />Track six fits the least on this album.  It's not bad on its own merits, but it just doesn't quite fit seamlessly with the other tracks.<br /><br />The songs are good semi-hardcore electronic music.  Some parts are heavy on the bass, but lately that is the trend in electronic music.<br /><br />Track two is the title track and definitely catchy and fun.<br /><br />Despite the negatives, this album is an enjoyable ride.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Around the World in 80 Days is a very challenging game without being frustrating.  Level 76 has me stumped! fun
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|A true crime life writer repeatedly moves his family from town to town trying to recapture his past glory.  We follow this attempt where he unexpectedly encounters the supernatural.<br /><br />Even with a formulaic plot, Sinister grabs the viewer for a fairly fast pasted ride.  There are a few plot holes; however, they could be explained using the realm of the supernatural.  The evil could have been better explained by utilizing the Professor Jonas character more.<br /><br />Negatives aside, the movie subsists with a remarkably small cast and small area.  The plot moves forward at a well paced clip with certain surprising moments.  The actors all properly portray their characters.  Also importantly, the story does not break its own rules.  While not a deep wrenching story, the characters are true-to-life, and the story is enjoyable.
1451695195|4.0|I liked this book but it bounces back and forth between the present and the afterlife experience too much.  It is more scientific than inspiring, but that was okay.
B009KEN87O|4.0|I bought this for my husband, but guess who's playing it?  Thankfully we've learned to share.. but, I'm STILL way ahead! ;)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Best game i have ever downloaded.<br />As they would say on the series RED VS. BLUE (revised for this review) &quot; that was the best game ever, of all time&quot;
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Everytime that I listen to this, I become relaxed and serene.  I only learned about Adele last year, from my kids.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|My wife absolutely loved this e book. She is an avid reader and has read this book several times, she has gotten her miney's worth.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|My daughter, who is 3 1/2 loved this movie. It has a very specific target audience though, unlike some Disney movies which can appeal to a broader viewership.
0394873742|5.0|It's great for kids who like to discovery new things and pay attention to details. And it makes a good dance floor for a toddler...
B00AYCOUOG|4.0|this is a very good cd.<br />I, for one, think head music was a fantastic cd.......bloodsports is almost on par.
B003LQMZS0|4.0|Great little toy for what it is. Soft and interesting to young children. We used it often when we took him anywhere. Fits on strollers well too - lets you latch it to something so it doesn't fly when it gets inevitably tossed.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I can't stop playing it! It is very addicting! The graphics are fantastic. Enjoy hours of fun playing CALL OF ATLANTIS!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I was with my friend then she pulls her kindle out and plays a game and I watch then I got to play it was so fun and cool I just had to get it for myself so I did and I live it!!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The story is great but it's getting a little too predicable.  You can almost guess who is and who is not going to make it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm one of those people who hold out on reading the popular books just because they are popular. I didn't read Harry Potter for years for the same reason. That said, Hunger Games was a good read. It's a creative story that kept me interested the whole time. I can't say the same for the rest of the series, but I don't regret reading this book or even the rest of them. I would recommend Hunger Games to anybody looking for a easy read, a little excitement, and some pretty significant moral dilemas thrown in.
0757302661|5.0|Great book to feel confident for a natural birth. It teaches relaxing and breathing techniques to help you have control over your body during labor in order to have a successful and painless birth.
B002M7A79S|5.0|Everyone should see this movie!  Just make sure to watch the TV show (which is free on Amazon Prime) first.
B002UJIY70|5.0|Since enjoying the acting talent of Timothy Olyphant in the TV series &#34;Justified&#34; over the last couple of years, I finally made it a point of viewing some of his previous movies.  Great movie, lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing -- just don't read about it in IMBD ahead of watching it.  Thoroughly entertaining!!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|My son plays this game mostly and it makes him laugh the whole time. I admit when I watch him play its pretty funny to see what he comes up with.

0307956350|3.0|Iwent 'hot and cold' when reading this book as I found 'the plot' at times to be too unbelievable that they could actually happen. For me (on the whole) purchasing this book was a waste of time and money.

1250000971|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is once again at his very best. A fabulous read which I urge everyone to purchase/read as it's an excellent book!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|At first I was a little put off by the after the fact interview style narrative, but the book quickly picks up the pace and is hard to put down. Brooks is incredibly detailed and thorough in his research of what would happen and how a zombie war would go down. Looking forward to how eh adapt this into a movie.
1416562591|5.0|For me a wonderful read and a book which has a pride of place on my bookshelves. Beautifully, poetically and vividly wriietn. I'll certainly be reading The White Tiger again as this IS a tale which lives!
B005K17RU0|1.0|the old version was wonderful.  This new update ruined it.  Please bring back the old one. This version is cluttered and difficult to use.
B005Y8KWNS|3.0|Works good i would recommend it to people that want there documents on there device but the picture resolution isnt all that great other wise its okay
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Actually this was more concise than all of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it doesn't make it tight story telling. Acting was good and as we all know the Hobbit as a story in literary form made more sense than the following three books.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought this cable after my dog chewed up my other cable that was white. This cable is a lot more durable that the white cable. I gave this a 5 star because it holds up a lot better and has a 5 foot length that is great for when i am siting in bed. The only thing i have to worry about is keeping it away from my dog i highly recommend this to anyone with a kindle device.
B004JOCU2O|5.0|this is a real nail bighter Movie to watch, and My Family and I really enjoyed It. I have recomended this Movie to Friends and Family Members.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Great movie. Cinematography great and soundtrack is 2nd to none. Acting isn't great but its good enough to get the story line across.
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|I discovered Kurt Vile on his Childish Prodigy album. Since then i've bought everything he does and trying to get everything he's done. This is the latest in a legendary series of albums. I listen to alot of music and this guy is special. His music has a way of transporting you, messing with time. His talent is rare, cant recommend this enough.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I had always seen the movies on television and decided to read the book. It showed the Christian values in a family that we so need to share in these hard times.  Loved it, as always the book was better than the movie
B008M721MS|3.0|I read various reviews.  Some were good some were bad.  I can't really comment since I haven't had the opportunity to talk to anyone.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Classic and should be required viewing for anyone who is of any age, as it captures the youth of the 80's and classic humor perfectly.
B000000W6R|4.0|Its a must for pumpkins fans especially since the band is still together on this album. Add it to your collection.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I'm an avid solitaire fan/lover/fanatic lol and the moment I was able to put this on my Kindle Fire I was in heaven. I haven't stopped playing since. Love it!
B00004TJKI|4.0|Its long but at the time it came out it was pushing boundaries for movies. Lee Remick was a beauty in this movie. Great courtroom drama. Movie buffs it must be seen at least once and it is part of thr crietron collection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great story line. can't wait for it to start up again! Season 3 is the best so far. not for children.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I bought this album at a really low price for the quality of music. His songs are perfect for any mood you're in, and it's definitely an album to keep on repeat.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|THE PRODUCT WAS REQUIRED, AND THAT WAS LIKE ME THAN EXPECTED, THE ATTENTION WAS THE BEST, I HOPE OTHER GOODS BUY A FUTURE
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is my favorite 007 movie with Daniel Craig. First time I felt empathy for the vilian in a 007 story. The viewer is given insight into why the character feels justfied by his actions and we understand why.

B0010Z32OA|4.0|I thought that the story line was pretty original.  Entertaining with dramatic scenes.  I was surprised by some of the big name actors (Robert DeNiro).
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Wow this game was not in my realm of understanding or wanting to fingure out, and I couldn't get rid of it..I didn't like this one at all.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Title says it all. Once you start, you cant stop. Great show. Dont watch with children around though. A little gory.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|I feel like this is on of the first Disney movies that is both computer animated and sticks with it's Disney movie roots.

B0067R0APK|5.0|I got this application for free so it was really a bargain as it works well and gives you just the right amount of information.  It also allows you to add other cities which is really helpful.  I would recommend this application.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|All other reviews will be similar.. Brilliant, bloody brilliant mate.. Time, tea, women, you can say tardis without feeling bad.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Long with a few dull moments. Very eclectic soundtrack. Leonardo DiCaprio and Christoph Waltz carried the movie. I would say that it is an Interesting concept.
B00867GJYK|5.0|We absolutely love this movie and its even better watching it in high definition in the comfort of our own home!  A true gem of the Disney catalog of movies to own!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|5 stars great game! can barely put it down! it makes you think of ways to get all the coins and gain more region points! play every day!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I took my daughter to the movies to see this.  Not only did she enjoy this, but I think I may have likes it more!  Providing a great trip down memory lane for us kids of the NES generation, several nods to the past of video games are in this!<br /><br />Animation is top notch, and is a movie totally worthy of being added to your home movie library!  Combined with Amazon's easy ordering, fast shipping, and best shopping experience in the world, its a lot of fun!!!
B00A1C16HS|5.0|Very well done remake of a classic with incredible acting.  I enjoyed it very much.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|It doesn't pretend to be more than it is. It doesn't try to save the world. It doesn't force in a love interest. It doesn't force character development down your throat. It's a beautiful, fun, well-timed action movie. Watch it.
B006YRVY2G|5.0|Season 2 has a greater range of emotions.  It is perfect for the show.  I look forward to the 3rd season.
B00000IREA|5.0|In the far future travel with well-equipped Barbarella on a mind-bending search to find the elusive scientist Duran Duran. On the way you must first encounter the Labyrinth, the Black Guards, the Blind Angel, the City of Night, the Great Tyrant and the mysterious liquid energy source that thrives on evil. Creative, imaginative sets and costumes, and highly entertaining, also featuring Anita Pallenberg and a tongue-in-cheek story line. As with \\"Candy,\\" that was released the same year, 1968, this film's charm lies in the fact of its being a French-Italian co-production. Highly recommended!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought it was a great book right up to the end.  The end however left me feeling incomplete.  There are to many questions left unanswered.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Omg!!! This game is sooo good!! If you like temple run,1&amp;2, temple run brave and subway surfers then you should totally play this game!!! This game totally deserves 5 stars baby!!!!!-
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I expected a western with humor and assumed a little killing and maybe foul language.<br /><br />I did not expect the overwhelming amount of foul language and bloody killing and racism<br /><br />Only redeeming is that he rescued his wife.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Such a cute story, even if the beginning does me make cry!  Great for all ages.  Highly recommend to everyone.

0385344333|2.0|Like many other reviewers, I have read all the Reacher books and, generally, found them enjoyable.  I like Reacher's many quirks, like his obsessiveness about coffee and the cup it comes in.  I also liked accompanying Reacher as he follows the clues and solves the novel's mystery on the way to its action-packed climax.<br /><br />And then there's \\"A Wanted Man.\\"<br /><br />Allow me to summarize.  Reacher drives around the Midwest.  A lot.  An awful lot.  Then he finds some faceless terrorists in a mysterious building, with some mysterious containers.  Reacher shoots all the terrorists.  The end.  (Did you want to know who the terrorists were or what they were doing?  I think there were two sentences about a money laundering scheme.)<br /><br />Childs needs to up his game.  This was a complete miss.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The story is entertaining, but the main character has too many fetishes that I deem sadistic and thus not sexy. The writing is amateurish, and too many elements of the love story aspect of the book are too fantastical and unrealistic. Just wasn't a great read. I won't be continuing with the series.
1609611543|4.0|Just beginning to explore/research gluten/wheat and its impact on diet and nutrition.  This book is informative but very technical.  Many details on studies, cholesterol, etc.  I wanted something more basic so skimmed some sections, but overall, I came away with a better understanding of the author's view anyway.  Still researching, but I feel this book has some merit.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Annoying over use of the word &#34;swanky&#34; .  The main character could not remember the events that landed him in the mental hospital, and when it was finally revealed it didn't seem all that dramatic. The all-too-convenient encounter with the old friend from the mental hospital was too far fetched. Very disappointed.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I loved the first trilogy, and while seeing this one in 3D in the theater really did not impress me, seeing it at home the second time made me love it as much as any of the first ones.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I enjoyed learning about Tina Fey's road to stardom. She comes off as a totally normal person, which makes her relatable and not like a pretentious celebrity.
1863514201|4.0|Going back to childhood hobby of embroidery. I am interested in trying to embroidery a photo of my mother. So thought some of the techniques found in the book would assist me.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This is a great look at how innovative styles of management can create a new culture within the larger system. The book was an interesting read that I would highly recommend.
0767819659|5.0|good story with a michevious little heroine and her friends.  Great film for 6yr olds and up.  I orginally owned one on VHS and was delighted it had been released in DVD format.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excelled my expectations. While a horrible story of loss, greed, death & destruction it also showed how the oppressed overcome evil. How love can conquer against the odds. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
1582701709|1.0|Don't recommend it. It makes you God and you don't need anything else. I trashed it. Not recommended except to those who are into wishful thinking.
B00AEBB932|5.0|Best western ever.  All westerns should be compared to this one!  Alan Ladd was born for this part.  Never saw a western I like more.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|This game is not too bad. It's basically an ad for Playmobil. They shouldn't make you pay so much for digital content.
B004DM0UII|2.0|not the best app for streaming audio from web sites. difficult to jump to  different points in the track. constantly disconnects and start playing again from the beginning
1400069807|4.0|I expected this to be a rant against processed food manufacturers--which would have suited me fine.  But instead it was a well-balanced treatment of a complicated situation.  It helps you understand how we got to where we are today and I think clearly indicates that some form of government intervention is the only thing that is going to allow the food industry to do what it knows is best for its customers, rather than for its shareholders.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Great realistic movie of our first major battle against the North regular soldiers.  Very accurate and intense movie. Great acting and cast very well. Took first place, for me used to be Platoon as favorite Vietnam movie.
B000A0K2JO|1.0|Honestly, I threw out the original packaging and kept forgetting to return this. Just threw it away a couple days ago. Annoyed.
B00136JQMI|5.0|i would to any jazz lover. Kind of Blue is one of the best albums of all time.  If you are thinking about exploring a new style of music to listen to, this is a great album that should be in everyones collection.  It has stood the test of time and will continue to IMHO. Miles is one of the true legends.  A description to not be thrown around lightly.
B003JIPJRE|3.0|I'm not much of a superhero comic reader, and I'm not all -that- familiar with Batman. I've seen a few of the movies, learned a bit about him from friends of mine and from podcasts that talk about comics, and I was only a casual watcher of The Animated Series when it debuted in the early 90s. I keep meaning to read Frank Miller's stuff on Batman though, and I've had the Arkham games on my wishlist for a while. Under the Red Hood is a movie I've been meaning to see for a long time, ever since it first came out actually. Reviews for it were praising this as the best Batman-anything, calling it a dark film, accessible to anyone, even if they aren't versed in the world of Gotham City. I finally watched it last night, and from the opening sequence between the Joker and Robin, I kept feeling like I was watching a handful of episodes of The Animated Series, minus the great voice acting from Conroy and Hamill, and some of the suspense. It's tough to say if people just have low standards when it comes to animation these days, or if it's blind fanboyism that's doing the raving.<br /><br />We start out with Batman racing to find Robin, who's been captured by the Joker. The Joker's got Robin tied up, and relentlessly beats him across the face with a crowbar, having fun like he usually does. Eventually, the Joker leaves, and before Batman can even get in the building to save Robin, BLAM! It explodes and the Boy Wonder is no more. Cut to 5 years later and the Joker is now locked up at Arkham Asylum, while Black Mask tries to control Gotham City. Unfortunately for him, a new guy's in town- Red Hood. He rules over all the other criminals through fear, and acting on his promises of killing anyone without a second's warning if they act up. Heck, even if they DON'T act up, he'll take them out. Red Hood is cleaning up Gotham City while still not doing the 'right' thing. Batman learns of this new foe after dispatching an advanced robot that was part of a shipment to Black Mask. As the days go by, Batman puts the pieces together regarding Red Hood's identity, while still being troubled by the loss of his sidekick. Meanwhile, Black Mask is getting fed up with Red Hood interfering with his plans, realizing that he's always one step behind. And so he decides to make a deal with someone legitimately insane who shouldn't have any problems with the situation.<br /><br />At about an hour and 15 minutes long, Under the Red Hood never drags on. It moves at a brisk pace, with very few scenes without a fight or important dialogue. I even kept waiting for the obligatory \\"my parents are dead!\\" scene, and fortunately got no such thing! This movie is full of action and detective work, and most Batman fans are very pleased with the end result. There's not a huge cast of characters, so enough time is spent with everyone, from Black Mask to Nightwing to the Joker. We even get some good scenes with young Robin when Batman is having flashbacks of the beginning of his sidekick's career. Scenes like this are done well, and tastefully. They're not just put there to make you feel sorry for Robin or Batman, and serve their purpose. Animation-wise, Under the Red Hood looks very good for the most part, though some CG animated objects are a bit of an eyesore. I'm not one of those anti-CG nuts who rolls their eyes whenever they see it, or hear about a new CG movie, but what's used here doesn't look very good, and I can't help but wonder how much harder it would have been to just animate it like everything else.<br /><br />So it's a pretty good movie in the plot, action and animation categories, so what's the problem? For me, there were two big problems. The first being the voice for the Joker and the other being that they were tame when it came to the violence. I'll get that second problem out of the way first here with a good example. In the beginning when the Joker is just wasting Robin with the crowbar, it doesn't seem like it hurts that much. There's no blood, no bruises,not even cringe-inducing sound effects to really send the message home. It seems like Robin's being hit with something much less deadly, like a plastic bat. There's another very good scene later on involving a certain someone's \\"interview\\" with Black Mask, where an object is used to cut the throat of someone. -As soon- as the glass swipes past the neck, the dude's hands are up, like he's choking, and again, there's no blood. Look, I'm not a gore hound (in fact, I get bored with how violent things like God of War are these days), but is there something wrong with adding some blood to make things a bit more real and serious here? The whole movie has the 'old western death' syndrome, where people would get shot and fall over, and that'd be the end of it.<br /><br />Regarding the Joker's voice, I can't say anything bad about John Dimaggio, as he does seem to be trying to give a new take on the character. At the same time, it just doesn't sound right to me. He's too serious, and sounds like he's smoked a few more packs than he should. For this reason, I didn't like the Joker's scenes as much as I would have if say, Mark Hamill had been brought back to do the role. The entire movie, I just kept imagining how much more fun his Joker would have been here. Listening to the performance he gives, it sounds like Dimaggio was going for a mix between the Hamill and Ledger Jokers.<br /><br />In the end, Under the Red Hood didn't impress me. It's a fun romp through Gotham City for me, someone who hasn't been there in a while, but could still be seen as maybe a three-part episode of a newer Batman animated series. Three stars isn't a bad rating at all. Though I'm sure plenty of fans are going to say otherwise with a healthy dose of 'No' votes for this review.
B006CHML4I|4.0|Keeps time perfectly if you use a winder each night as you sleep. Leaving it to manual wind each day would be inconvenient  Well worth the price though. The strap is attractive and easy to use.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|I love all the star wars movies and had no idea about this series until someone told me.  Since I watched the first episode I have been interested in it from the beginning.  I love how it focuses more on the lives of the troopers during the war more than the jedi.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I can't even imagine doing this to my best friend or any friend for that matter.  I actually checked the time on the movie to see how much longer until the end -- just hoping it might get better.  This movie isn't even worth one star -- what a waste of time.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|There's too much exposition and too many newly introduced characters in books 4 and 5, at least for my taste.  Also, too many long, boring passages that may go somewhere sometime but take too long to do so.  I'm not even a third of the way through and have already moved on to another, unrelated book.  I'll return to Dragons, but am not sure when.  Someone said it gets better near the end, but oh, the tedium to get there!
1906735875|4.0|I'm kinda-sorta a Judge Dredd fan. I was introduced to the character through his 1990s team-ups with Batman, and later, I picked up reprints of the early Judge Death stories. But I never properly delved into Dredd's universe, until I bought this collection of his earliest appearances.<br /><br />Well, I'm happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed these old Dredd yarns. Some of the stories are a little short and simple, but that's part of the charm of old comics - they haven't got the overblown sense of self-importance you get in many contemporary comic books. And anyway, there are several longer story arcs presented here that should satisfy your craving for epic-style adventures.<br /><br />To me, the most interesting part of Judge Dredd's comic is its bizarre tone. The stories take place in a futuristic New York City (much bigger than today's version) that's overrun with crime and surrounded by a post-apocalyptic wasteland. But while this scenario sounds grim, the comic is in fact full of dark humor and satire, which makes it an amusing read. Indeed, there is even total goofball humor in these old stories -- often provided by Dredd's endearingly ridiculous sidekick, Walter the \\"Wobot.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, many of the stories are extremely violent, and Judge Dredd is sometimes so brutal that he's little better than the criminals he fights against. I'm sure you can get lost in deep analysis of the political and social worldviews being presented in these bizarre tales...or, you can just enjoy them as fun shoot 'em ups and not worry too much about looking for depth!<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a good investment. The stories, though uneven, are mostly very good. And the artwork is consistently good-to-great; in fact, I'm tempted to call Brian Bolland the best comic book artist ever. He's certainly up there. So yeah, for the relatively low price, you can't beat this collection. It's a great intro to Dredd, and a fun way to pass a few lazy afternoons.

B00A6SZRJ0|4.0|Wish it could've said if any of the songs were used in trailers but nonetheless a very awesome CD! I very much like &#34;All the Kings Horses&#34; (track 6) since it somehow reminds me of the song in Nightmare Before Christmas that goes &#34;what's this? what's this?&#34; and just makes me giddy. X3
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Great movie!! Would recommend to watch it! Sad at times the actors are great! Please watch this movie! Awesome watch!!
B005K15XR4|5.0|I thought I would love Skyworld more than this one, but all the tracks are equally, if not just a bit, better than anything musical I've heard in a while. Very fun CD if you wanna remember the trailers you used to watch over and over until the movie you wanted came out and the song that you fell in love with was nowhere on the movie CD. Wish it detailed what trailers used which ones but now my sister and I can go on a scavenge hunt for this info. :d Would love to know if &#34;Fill My Heart&#34; was used on Cloud Atlas 'cuz ohmygod it sounds so much like Cloud Atlas and its so beautiful~! Highly recommended.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this game.  Actually, I'm addicted to it. Bingo Blitz is the first thing I play when I get home from<br />work. A great stress reliever.<br />Wish I could sell some of my prizes for coins though.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love this show and I always miss it due to job hours. It's great to be able to watch when I want.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It's Harry Potter.  This is the best price I've seen for all 8 movies.  There aren't a lot of extra features, but who needs that when you just want your own Harry Potter collection?
B004MC8CA2|2.0|On the positive it allowed direct access to chapter and verse.  It was not always available away from home because it was on the internet,
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|...to see it again. It's just as relevant today as it was then.  Different media, same values and lack thereof..
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Jurassic Park , Always a great film to watch. showed to my ten year old son for the first time, he thought it was great.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is a great book.  If you like fantasy and have been frightened away by the size or braided nature of the novels (like I was for many years) then I would recommend giving them a try in spite of that.  People claim 'fully realized' for a lot of things but the Song of Fire and Ice actually feels like it might be true.<br /><br />So why four stars?<br /><br />It isn't the Third book of the series which was in my opinion the cream of the crop.<br /><br />Oh.  If you start reading these (and haven't seen the HBO series which is also quite good) then keep in mind that the first book doesn't really give you a good idea of the feel of the following books.  So if you find the first book a bit slow (I did) move on to the next one.  Slow it is not.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|This is such an awesome cd. I love them. The song in the end is amazing. The content of their music is refreshing and at the same time we can rock out (:
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is the best movie I've ever seen.  I expected to like it, because I have seen a performance of it on PBS and the music was catchy, but I didn't really follow the story.  This movie really made the story come alive for me.  I never expected a musical would ever be my favorite movie.<br /><br />I actually pre-orded this movie.  This is a first for me.  Usually even if I like a movie enough to own it, I wait and buy it used.<br /><br />If you are a Christian, this movie will be even more meaningful and probably even challenging for you.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I've been a Fall Out Boy fan from the beginning and although their sound has changed a bit over the years, this album shows that it's for the best.  I don't think there is a bad song on the album and if you like Folie A Deux, you're going to LOVE Save Rock and Roll.  I mean come on, does it get any better than a duet with Elton John?!? I think not!!
B004EWEX9Y|4.0|The produce was delivered within the specified time period.  Tested product immediately & it worked great with my Ipod touch 4g. Was able to stream netflix, view pictures & videos stored on ipod, listen to music through the tv.
0307592731|5.0|Saw Cheryl's interview with Oprah last year and knew I had to read her story.  Cheryl showed true grit in her hike along the Pacifc Trail.  Well written; couldn't put it down at times!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. all smiles this way. no bad comments and nothing negative to say about this calculator app.
B0043URV5U|5.0|These two CD's have all his great hits and then some.  Whenever I listen to his music, it takes me back to another time when life was a little simpler.  Thanks so much!
B002NZK5RI|5.0|Awesome movie. I bought this as a gift for someone, who also loved it. If you're in the mood for a good scary movie, this is it. I never get tired of watching it and Sigourney Weaver is awesome as always.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It is a fast read. Simple to read and simple plot. It's the type of book that could be a movie on the Lifetime channel. A feel good easy read with a predictable and happy ending. No real thinking involved. It was what I needed for the day. Junk food for the brain.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great plot and award winning performance from all the main actors. Jamie Foxx did an awesome job and I loved Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie; he's such a versatile actor. He played his part so well. However, the movie has a lot violent action scenes and strong language so make sure kids are not anywhere near you when watching the movie.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This movie captures the best in Western movies with the best in sci-fi movies.  The action was great and the story line was also great.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I did not know what to expect before getting this movie.  But once I watched it...Well worth my time and the money.
B008BQL77K|4.0|I've heard the show called a \\"Game of Thrones Lite\\" - and that seems fitting.<br /><br />Doesn't quite get at the problem like the show Angel does with Wolfram & Hart - Attorneys at Law, but it's still worth the watch . . .<br /><br />Especially good for those longing to embrace the wacky world that is legal dystopia but who aren't as interested in the paranormal elements.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Would not purchase this again or any of the hobbit movies again.  Not worth the money to me.  Movie was just OK.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|some funny parts, dragged a bit but overall a decent movie. I would not pay for this again. blah blah
B00908DDZM|5.0|I surprised my husband with this cd for his birthday. He's been playing it over and over again. We both enjoy it very much. Also loved the free ripped version for iTunes. :-)
B005LAIIFS|5.0|We all loved this movie. I took the kids at Christmas time and was dreading sitting threw another boring, silly kid movie. The last movie I really enjoyed watching with my kids was Tangled. So I really don't get into many cartoons, but this movie I loved! My 15 year old down to my 3 year old sat at the edge of their seats threw the entire thing. So I bought it for them all for Easter and they have all watched it now several times.  There is some scary horses in it that mine younger two found frightening but if you have seen Sleeping beauty's dragon this is along the same scaryness:} Very clean, very uplifting fun movie!
B00BP29SAA|4.0|My daughter enjoys all of the Dr. Panda games. This one is no different. Its like going to the store for her. She loves shopping and putting stuff in the cart. This game will keep her entertained for a good while which is not always the case with some games.
0553386794|5.0|I love all the books in this series, I just finished Book Four and I am anxiously awaiting the next book. I cant wait to find out what happens. I think about some of the characters in the book on almost a daily basis, like they are real people I care about. I highly recommend to anyone who loves to get lost in a book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn has captured the self-centeredness of this generation of Manhattan dwellers with a wonderful flair for capturing the reader's attention.  I highly recommend it as a good read.
B003QSMCKO|4.0|I love this movie and so do my boys. This is one of the few disney movies that I dont mind watching over and over again :)
B0074VA2T2|2.0|A not so great app, very minimal, with no real story or interaction other than just tapping the screen to make the caterpillar eat the fruit.  Little to no appealing animation. Would not recommend.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This movie was not as scary or supernatural as I was expecting, decent suspense but no closure at the end.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A \\"keep you up til 3am\\" kind of book. A few twists throughout the novel will make your jaw drop and keep you saying \\"just one more chapter\\".  I couldn't wait to get to the end and when I did it left me wanting more. The book would have benefited with an epilogue.. great story til the end..did not leave me satisfied but I guess that may have been what the author was going for.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Creepy, sexy, suspenseful...great acting, I love Jessica Lang, I cant wait to see what the next season has in store!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I run a lot of peripherals into my laptop during audio production that I have to swap out a lot when working.<br /><br />With this one hub I was able to keep my external hard drive on the second USB port and run everything else through this, and it managed to power it all! I was really shocked when I had my interface able to run on the fourth port and now I'm able to use my entire workstation all thanks to this hub.<br /><br />Additionally I have a PixelFlash USB 3.0 CF Card Reader that transfers incredibly fast, where my other devices are USB 2.0 but don't engage in processes that need or take advantage of the USB 3.0 speed.<br /><br />Basically this hub was the one thing I needed, and I found it by contacting Anker's customer service by e-mail, which was remarkably fast for them to reply.<br /><br />The device is small, it doesn't have a cord that's too long and isn't look bad, in fact it looks great with my setup.<br /><br />So for what I got, I'm happy to say I got what it was worth for every single dollar.

B000000H57|4.0|Blending together Alice Cooper's shock rock persona with a unique and very dark sense of humor, and mixing those things with a dollop of Beatles-inspired melodies, and some Black Sabbath-derived doom metal, Type O Negative came up with a winning recipe for their fourth full-length album, 1996's \\"October Rust.\\" The end result is an extremely murky and dense -- yet equally as memorable -- gothic-doom record, and Type O's finest this side of 2007's watershed/swansong release, \\"Dead Again.\\"<br /><br />Frontman Peter Steele lays down the foundation of the album with his own brand of accomplished clean singing, heavy, moving bass lines, and lyrics that are often, quite frankly, hilarious. The drumming takes a page out of the industrial rock playbook in that it is all programmed; but even if this recording lacks an organic sound on that front, it more than makes up for it with Kenny Hickey's abundance of relentlessly sludgy guitar licks. And the icing on the cake comes from Josh Silver's layers of keyboards which help add some more new layers -- i.e. much needed texture and ambiance -- to the arrangements.<br /><br />After the lead-off \\"joke\\" track (\\"Bad Ground\\"), the actual album gets underway with \\"Love You To Death,\\" a piece of pure, Pentagram-inspired doom metal. Its heavy, thundering guitars and densely sludgy, churning rhythms are speckled with Peter's soaring vocals and a handful of darkly melodramatic keyboards. \\"Be My Druidness,\\" then, is a very appropriate follow-up to this song, as it, too, is a very dark, gloomy, and doomy number with more somberly dramatic crooning (Peter really shows off his baritone, here). The only difference is this cut is driven by heavy, churning, viscerally grumbling bass lines. Next comes \\"Green Man,\\" which boasts one of the album's most memorable and standout-worthy riffs. It comes in the form of a great and jangly acoustic guitar riff, and one that offset's the rest of the song's usual abundance of sludginess, and compliments Peter's accomplished clean singing really well. \\"Red Water (Christmas Mourning)\\" is an opaque, gothic-tinged near ballad with one very dark and doomy, repetitively trance-inducing pure doom riff laid against a wall of backing guitar harmonies and dreary vocals.<br /><br />\\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\" is a comparatively up-tempo cut that augments its trippy, effects-laden vocals with meaty and hefty chugging. And just as this song comes across sounding like James Earl Jones covering a metal song does the next one sound like an Alice Cooper cover. \\"Die With Me\\" has some heavy and crunchy parts, sure; but for the most part, it is a gorgeous acoustic brooder. A handful of other standout tracks from the album's second half include \\"Burnt Flowers Fallen,\\" which is a positively catchy inclusion with one trance-inducing riff repeated over and over ad infinitum; the epic, seven-and-a-half-minute-long \\"In Praise Of Bacchus\\"; and the hooky, up-tempo, and almost punk-like tinges that come with covering Neil Young's \\"Cinnamon Girl.\\"<br /><br />True, \\"October Rust\\" is not for everyone. Abiding by a thoroughly sustained mood, persistently mid-tempo pacing, and overlong playing time (it clocks in at a whopping seventy-two-plus minutes in length) will come across as tedious, plodding, and even a bit dull to some listeners. But even so, if you are looking for something different, something nuanced, nicely textured, and something that's \\"heavy\\" but not in the traditional metal way, this album is strongly recommended, as it is to the more patient gothic/doom metal fans out there that are looking for a record that gets better with repeat listens.accomplished clean singing really well. \\"Red Water (Christmas Mourning)\\" is an opaque, gothic-tinged near ballad with one very dark and doomy, repetitively trance-inducing pure doom riff laid against a wall of backing guitar harmonies and dreary vocals.<br /><br />\\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\" is a comparatively up-tempo cut that augments its trippy, effects-laden vocals with meaty and hefty chugging.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Very good, nothing else to say.  This is a great series and definitely worth watching.  Not sure how it will go when we reach the less than excellent books.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|I got this for my 2.5 year old and he loves it. I wish the caterpillar was a little bigger, I'm not sure he's made the connection of this to his beloved hungry caterpillar book (he's never went and got the book or anything when playing it, and he normally will make connections and go get things that are related to each other). But he still enjoys playings this and being able to do everything on his own. He often wonders over to the higher levels.... and something I really like about this is that he can play on those levels. He gets everything wrong, but the controls and alerts aren't such that stop him from playing it anyways just because he's getting it wrong (something we have ran into on other games). The app hasn't had any issues I've seen, everything seems to work the way it should. Very good app for little hands.
B00AP9RQE4|3.0|While better than a couple of other books in the series, this one is definitely not as good as most of them.  It is pretty obvious that the series is not nearly as good as it was in the beginning.
B00846REIS|4.0|Definitely a hot, trashy, and sexy book. Not the best writing and the plot is a little contrived but it was still a good read and had me hooked until the end.

B00AZMFO6I|4.0|After travelling to \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,\\" Maggie Smith joins \\"Quartet,\\" a life-affirming film that is as heart-warming as John Madden-directed romantic comedy. \\"Quartet\\" also marks the 75-year-old Dustin Hoffman's debut as a film director.<br /><br />\\"Quartet\\" revolves around the guests of a home for retired musicians, planning to hold an annual fund-raising concert. This year, however, tickets are not selling well, when a new guest Jean Horton (Maggie Smith) arrives. This should be perfect, for she once collaborated with Reg (Tom Courtenay), Wilf (Billy Connolly), and Cissy (Pauline Collins), to perform Verdi's \\"Rigoletto,\\" but Jean - Reg's former wife - refuses to sing.<br /><br />The screenplay is written by Ronald Harwood, based on his own play. The veteran writer is known as screenwriter for such wonderful works as \\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,\\" \\"The Pianist,\\" and \\"The Dresser\\" (the last starring Tom Courtenay). With a rather conventional storyline, \\"Quartet\\" may not be among his best, but it is still enjoyable with likeable characters.<br /><br />Jumayn Hunter (\\"Attack the Block\\") briefly appears as an avid hip-hop fan, engaging in a debate with Reg teaching opera over similarities of two music styles. You may also enjoy seeing real-life opera singers and musicians including Dame Gwyneth Jones (don't miss the end credits). And of course, the film has great music. In short \\"Quartet\\" is a charming film with great performances.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|The movie was a little dragged out,but other than that it was pretty actioned packed & enjoyable!! I hope E-1 watches this movie as I would recommend it to E-1. TY

B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Wooden uninspiring characters who I didn't really care much one way or another about.  Trite storyline, have seen similar science fiction plot lines like this one going back to seventies.  Heard the book was very good.  I haven't read it but this movie certainly would encourage me to do so.  To be fair I love Stephen King and practically the movies of his stories were for the most part bad as well.  Certainly glad I watched this at home, I don't like wasting theatre time on junk like this.

B001GMQALY|1.0|The movie was terrible. Every time you thought something didn't happen is being very depressed. By the time you get to the end don't really care what happens because it's so lousy. And why would you go back to The guy that way. That you're upset because you left because of how that he treated you? Strange.

B008JFUO36|5.0|There may be spoilers.<br /><br />Some critics have panned this new film from director and co-writer Joseph Kosinski, in this his second film (\\"TRON: Legacy\\"), as being highly derivative.  But let's face it, how many films are so fresh and new that they delve into uncharted territory?  In any case, don't care.  Whether it's a drama, a comedy, a horror movie or even a romantic comedy, it's how well it is delivered that counts.  And this film delivers.<br /><br />Like \\"TRON\\" the film is visually arresting.  Seen on a big screen, the sets are huge but sparse, drawing the audience in.  Set in a war-ravaged Earth of 2077 devoid of humans, all of whom have resettled on a moon of Saturn, only Jack (terrific Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain.  They are partners (both romantic and professionally) whose mission is to watch over the drones that patrol the area for a smattering of \\"Scavs\\" who were the defeated invaders.  While Earth won the war, they lost the planet which continues to be harvested for water and other ecological matter.<br /><br />Jack is the investigative repair man who goes out alone.  Victoria never leaves their high control point and guides him using sophisticated tracking technology.  While investigating an unusual radio beacon, Jack witnesses a spacecraft crash.  One of the survivors is a human flight officer named Julia (Olga Kurylenko) who he has occasionally dreamed about.  Both Jack and Vic have had their memories \\"washed\\" in order to eliminate thoughts of the terrible war.  Uh, sure.  What Jack believes to be \\"Scavs\\" turns out to be Beech (Morgan Freeman) and his collection of survivors.  The truth is out there and Jack must find it, and does with the help of Julia.<br /><br />Like \\"TRON,\\"  \\"Oblivion\\" is beautiful to watch and has a great soundtrack, mostly provided by French electronic band, M83.  Yes, \\"Oblivion\\" borrows from a list of movies too long to mention, but for those of us who salivate for science fiction films with a breath of intelligence, this one does the trick.<br /><br />BLU RAY REVIEW: In this subsequent viewing of this terrific sci-fi film, I was able to tie up a few elements I didn't quite understand the first time around.  I would also have to say this is one of the best looking movies of any genre I've seen.  The special features on the Blu ray disc add some clarity on how and why the filmmakers went for a certain look and it truly comes across beautifully.<br /><br />The other thing I had missed the first time around was the romantic relationship between Jack and Victoria and subsequently Julia.  It was there but just wasn't a point of focus.  By \\"there,\\" I mean it wasn't explicit, either by subdued actions or love making.  Regarding the later, the most interesting coupling occurs in the swimming pool.  It seems clear that Jack's relationship with Victoria seems forced or maybe expected is a better word.  He does all the right things that husbands and wives do, but it seems like a matter of routine more than true love.  Watch Cruise's face during those intimate close ups.  Something is wrong.  Of course those memory flashbacks of Julia don't help.  When Jack finally does find Julia, it all clicks.  Not quickly, but you can see in Jack's reactions, he loves this woman.  But why?  In the end, he shows how much he loves her.  \\"Oblivion\\" is also a beautiful love story.<br /><br />There is nothing like watching a beautiful movie like this on the big screen, but this Blu Ray transfer comes damn close.  The 1080p transfer is spectacular in every respect and certainly will be a show off piece to a good system.  It comes in the original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 and does a great job replicating the original film.  The dystopian world is now essentially uninhabited and the stark whites and various shades contrast nicely with deep dark blacks.  When the story moves underground, shadows and shadings of grey prevail.  But even when Jack retreats to his cabin in the wilderness, we get beautiful greens and various earth tones in all their splendor.  I could see no encoding issues.  The contrast and detail are excellent.<br /><br />Equaling the visuals is a magnificent DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio track.  Again put this one on your demo list.  If you have sub-woofers, they will get a workout as the rumbles coming from many sources including gunfire, rockets and explosions.  The surrounds are constantly in play with movement from side to side, back and forth as the drone ships fly around.  Dialog is clear and well presented.  Ambient noise is ever present as well.<br /><br />Extras include an excellent commentary track by Tom Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski, a 48 minute \\"making of\\" documentary, some deleted scenes and get this, an isolated musical score by M83 in Dolby TruHD 5.1 (24 bit, 96kHz).  A great package to own.autiful greens and various earth tones in all their splendor.  I could see no encoding issues.

B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Not being more than a very occasional viewer of this genre, I knew nobody associated with it save Morgan Freeman,  always a class act whatever he puts his hand to. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this a fine action film for all ages, with the two younger star performers coming through quite well in their 'kill 'em nineteen different ways' roles. The  stunts are excellent and the script  well-conceived to keep things moving with the minimum of thought and  talk.<br />I would say this has an appeal for all ages, sexes and  background saving only those who desire \\"meaningful ideas and social significance\\".  Oh, yes, those who do not like the \\"f\\" word in several variations, should avoid the film and/or see that the younger kids are excluded from the company. The two sexual bits are so short in duration and empty of meaningful activity that they shouldn't be a problem for protective parents.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|Movie was a little slow and not enough action, but a nice continuum of the plot.  It led nicely to part two of the serice title.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|It arrived on time. and the item is what I want. Worked well. I checked other places, all are much more expensive than this one.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I saw this movie at least 20 times.  Each time I picked up on more of the storyline.  It is a sci-fi action film but was entertaining as well as relative to what is happening to our planet.  Loved it!
B00797MB0O|4.0|this was a good film with an interesting main character and an interesting storyline.  A lonely, confused, 30-something woman who still thinks she's 17 decides to take what she thinks is hers, regardless of  the fact it is not, and in the process, appears to begin to start to grow-up.  She's stubborn, so it doesn't happen quickly or naturally.  She fights it every step of the way.  Her story is sad.  Another not-feel-good movie.  I appreciated the story; the struggle to understand and grow.  The ending I did not see coming.  Regardless, it works.  I just didn't like it.  Charlize was great (as always), as was Patton O.  It would have been nice to see him do a little growing too.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun, addicting and great to pass the time. But it doesn't update for me automatically so I had to remove it from my device and when I reinstalled it I loss all my progress. I had to start all over.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Good action flick. Chick from Game of Thrones is a good bad guy. Not much else to say. I liked it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Lovely to play alone in the dark at night. Great fun! My kids liked it too! Wish the demos were a bit longer.
0142419400|4.0|After reading Lola & The Boy Next Door, I was a little skeptical about the hype surrounding Stephanie Perkins' novels. However, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised in reading Anna & The French Kiss.<br /><br />Anna is a rising senior from Atlanta, Georgia who's father sends her off to spend her last year in high school at the American School of Paris. Crazy as it sounds, Anna is UPSET that her father would do something as wonderful as give her an all expensive paid YEAR in Paris! So grudgingly, she enters her final year of high school in a distant land where she doesn't speak the language. However, once Anna is there, she meets a group of amazing friends and starts off a year full of new beginnings. There's just one problem....she ends up falling for a boy who is taken.<br /><br />While Anna's' character is somewhat cliche, her storyline isn't overly unbearable. Perkins adds depth to the storyline by pairing Anna's trials and tribulations with different viewings of cinema or books that the character studies in school or goes to see in her free time. I really enjoyed this maneuver by Perkins because unlike in Lola's story, Anna's dream of becoming a film critic are acted on subtly instead of drastically. This allowed me to not feel overpowered by the extraness of Anna's character. The interweaving of movie knowledge within Anna's story also gave me something to draw comparison's to in Anna and St. Clair's (i.e., her French crush) encounters.<br /><br />In addition to this, I enjoyed the fact that Perkins' novel was set in the romantic atmosphere of Paris, but she didn't try to beat readers over the head with too much romance too quick. She spoonfeeds her readers Anna and St. Clair's story in a way that isn't tedious or too overbearing. ***SPOILER*** Yet, I was a little peeved that one of Anna and St. Clair's other friends was hurt in the process of the two becoming a couple. I would've preferred if Perkins didn't insert an extra girl for Anna to have to competewith within her own circle of friends to date St. Clair. This just seemed extra brutal in terms of the standard rules of friendship do's and dont's.***SPOILER***<br /><br />This being said, while this book isn't fully original in plot or theme, I did truly enjoy it. I would definitely reread and recommend this book to others. I'm seriously really looking forward to Isla & The Happy Ever After to come out in September after reading this novel.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love this movie because it shows what great lengths one would go to save another from a certain death.Overall it was a great and well written movie. Will purchase for my collection.
B00ANYD2OE|3.0|You know those books who get raved about by everybody in all of Booktopia and you tell yourself, \\"I'm going to read this book because it must be fan-tastic if everybody else loves it so much?\\"....Whelp,  Lola & The Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins falls under that category for me.<br /><br />I chose to read this book before its companion because well, Anna & The French Kiss was checked out at my local library and this was all they had at the time. I went into the book all drummed up and ready to sing its praises afterwards. However,...I was faced with disappointment.<br /><br />While this book isn't bad, it's not technically good either. The characters in this story seemed to me to be ones that were harvested from other YA Fiction and placed smack-dab in the middle of Perkins' novel. For instance, Lola is a somewhat contrived character who is labeled as the fashionable/artsy daughter of a same-sex male couple. The couple adopted Lola from one of the dad's drug addicted sister when she was younger and wasn't ready to raise a child.<br /><br />Perkins also gives Lola the somewhat obvious aspiration to become a costume designer and formulates Lola's character to dress up as different \\"characters\\" throughout the novel to mark herself as an individual while also showing her creative side. Keeping with this \\"individual rebel\\" act, Lola's boyfriend, Max is delegated the role of the 20-somethin year old rocker who treats everyone else like crap besides Lola (or so it seems in the beginning). From here, we get the return of Cricket, the goofy/smart boy from next door who Lola was previously involved with and the usual sparks start to fly.<br /><br /> Major Things That Bothered Me About The Book:<br /><br />1. To me,  Lola and Cricket's courtship falls flat and the characters also comes off as a tad mismatched. Cricket's character seems so juvenile while, Lola seems to be this worldly girl who captures everyone's attention.<br /><br />2. Lola's refusal to acknowledge her feelings for Cricket sends her in a relentless circle dance. She goes from not wanting to say how she feels. To hiding her actual feelings from Max and Cricket. Then, when she finally gets to the point where she can't hide her feelings  anymore, Lola has to confront Max and he breaks her heart and leaves her in ultra-goth mode (which, she vehemently denies being in).<br /><br />3. By the novel's end, the only thing left to do is to \\"tidy up\\" and write a final romance sequence for Lola and Cricket......but wait!.....Perkins decides to go the extra mile and spice things up by giving Lola a final chance to showcase her clothing designs in the form of Calliope, Cricket's twin sister who happens to be a figure skater. This chance for Lola to showcase her talent seemed so random in the midst of the story's ending but, it does give readers the chance to see Lola's versatility in fashion. Suffice to say, Perkins has Lola rescue the day and then, sends both Cricket and Lola on their blissful way to a ball-like ending with Lola wearing a gown inspired by Marie Antoinette's fashion and Cricket looking dapper in a regular suit.<br /><br />Even though I would label this book as a typical YA love story, my biggest gripe with the story was that it didn't feel authentic. I felt as if I'd read the conversations between Lola and Cricket before and seen the \\"boy loves girl but, girl's with another guy\\" storyline before. Even Lola's zany outfits just seemed to be pilfered from other books with similar plots. I'm still looking forward to reading Anna & The French Kiss and even Isla & The Happily Ever After but, this book didn't exactly work me into a frenzy. Yet, If you're looking for a light, quirky read I'd suggest this book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Really good quick read.  The storyline was good and all the characters were easy to get to know.  Just wish we knew who he was writing to
1250007208|5.0|Cinder was EVERYTHING!<br /><br />You know how you see certain books in other people's reviews and just side-eye the book and think, \\"really?... how old are you again? Fairy tales are for kids!\\" Yeah...This was one of those times where I was totally wrong!<br /><br />******SPOILER******Cinder's story starts two centuries into the future after Earth has gone threw a destructive Fourth World War and the world is broken into new factions known as The Earthen Nations and their enemy, Luna a.k.a \\"The Moon.\\"In what we would now consider to be Asia, Cinder, a cyborg girl lives in New Beijing and works as a mechanic. Orphaned at a young age and lacking a sufficient memory of her childhood, she is adopted by the Linh family and taken in as their third daughter. However, once her stepfather dies after falling ill with the Leutomitis Plague, Cinder's life becomes a fictional Hell. Not knowing who she really is, Cinder lives life as an outcast and her stepmother's personal verbal punching bag. Yet, things start to look up one day when the Prince of the Eastern Commonwealth (a.k.a Asia) stops by her mechanic booth and gets her to fix his droid. From there, the fun begins. Love sparks start flying and secrets become the backdrop to a kick butt storyline.<br /><br />Things that I enjoyed about this story:<br /><br />1. Marissa Meyer seems to have thoroughly thought out what pieces of the Cinderella fairytale she would use to create her story. Instead of just extracting the whole tale, Meyer takes what she needs and leaves the rest of the tale alone. Her story never feels as if it was written between the lines of the Grimm brother's fairytale or in between the scenes of the Disney film adaptation. Meyer's story takes on a life of its own standing in the forefront in a saturated genre of literature where most stories have already been re-written to death. Her characters are well thought out and so is her setting for the story. Which brings me to point #2...<br /><br />2. The settingof Meyer's story made me extremely happy due to me not really being a fan of dystopian novels. I always feel as if dystopian writers are trying to prove something when they write about worlds that have gone wrong in their quest for perfection/one country dominance/etc.. Yet, Meyers makes me feel as if this world has naturally evolved even though she makes it clear that their was once a war that took place. Unlike her contemporaries though, she doesn't force the issue of gore and death or other bad things upon the reader.<br /><br />3. The technology in this novel was so cool! I really felt like the portscreens were really just amped up smart phones and this made me a little giddy about where technology might go in the future (LOL I know...how very nerdy of me). Cinder's BFF/Sidekick was one of my favorite characters. Iko, a humorous droid kept me laughing continuously whenever she oogled over the Prince or did some other human-like thing to cheer her buddy.Also, the ball scene where Cinder drives the car through New Beijing's streets seriously amused me. LMBO It was like a slight PSA about what'll happen if we don't learn to clean-up our Earth and recycle and all that Jazz.<br /><br />4. The ending was also my favorite part of the novel besides the ball scene when Cinder danced with the Prince/Emperor. ***SPOILER***The fact that Cinder is ended with her in jail makes me giddy at what's going to happen next. I always feel like the best stories end with the character in a hard place.<br /><br />Overall, Cinder was an excellent read. That I am glad that I picked up. I am now a true believer that fairy tales are not just for kids.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I read this book out of sequence, but I found it almost as good as The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo. Larson knows how to draw a reader in and keep him. The book was hard to put down (pause) when necessary. I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to get book 2.
0525478817|3.0|I'd like to preface this review with the disclaimer that I do not mean to be jerky however, my feelings in this review come from a place of wonderment at the state of emotion that come from bringing certain topics up in our society.<br /><br />That being said, something that I find so interesting about stories that deal with illnesses is that they seem to skirt the issues of being sick and the \\"perks\\" that terminally ill people seem to receive. However, John Green stands stoically in his authorship and calls us all out on our bull****.<br /><br />Both, Augustus and Hazel are made into optimistic if not angsty teenagers who are speeding toward oblivion furiously reaching out for a lifeline to keep them tethered to this world. While,I respect Green's writing style and story, I found that the characters themselves are not entirely new to literature. Hazel becomes the symbolic character that gets left behind once her boyfriend gets spirited off (no pun intended) to the after world and Augustus is the character who dies before his time. Together, their story while cute in some spots and heart-wrenchingly sad in others is not one that was fresh enough for me to fall down in total awe upon it's ending.<br /><br />Yet, I can say that I was enticed by the idea that two people could go on this sort of journey together to excavate a story's ending from their favorite author half-way across the world. Green produces this adventure in a way that's so realistic that I found myself seriously thunderstruck when I got to the scene where Peter Van Houten denies these two cancer-ridden teenagers their last grand \\"wish.\\" At this point in the story, I came to the conclusion that maybe what people like Augustus and Hazel really need is not so much our pity for them but, our understanding that they are really just individuals who are just like their \\"healthy\\" contemporaries who are searching for life's answers. Therefore, the one thing that seriously struck me in this novel is that peoplelike Augustus and Hazel are no different than you or I. Like us, their death is inevitable. However, unlike us, they have a ballpark figure of when their final days are going to draw to a close.<br /><br />Overall, I found the book to be an interesting and funny read with a light romance laced throughout the plot. I would recommend the book to others as a conversation starter but, not as a book that needs to be continuously read to understand it.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Like Book 3, I read this one out of sequence, but I still enjoyed it very much.  Because of reading it out of sequence, getting into the &#34;meat&#34; of this one went slower, but once in, I was hooked. Larson did it again.

B0056BMK6K|3.0|It has some useful tips, but no method you can actually use to attain the 1 million book Mr. Locke sold. At the end of the day, the same advice is true again and again for new authors, great story, writing , editing, and it HELPS huge if Amazon backs your book. there that's the basic just of the book. I saved you time.
0307352145|5.0|A carefully thought out and elegantly written work. It makes some great points, and challenges the current views on collaboration and teamwork. These things are important, of course, but Cain makes the case that the 'one size fits all' approach does not suit the significant number of people who think differently, and whose valuable contributions are lost in the noise.<br /><br />Speaking personally, I am sick of the current management trends that justify careless approaches to managing teams and cost-cutting cubicle farms with the pretext of 'collaboration'. I'm so glad to see a work like this that makes a logical argument for re-thinking our approach to our schools, workplaces, and social interactions.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Loved this show, one of the few that I try to constantly keep up with. Very witty and thought-provoking. Can't wait for more seasons.

B0059XTUVI|5.0|Meryl Streep did another excellent job!!  She makes everything so real to life.  Margaret Thatcher will never  ever be forgotten.
0061438294|5.0|very informative. lots of good examples and stories.  anyone could learn a lot about how to read people and figure out what they are really thinking despite what they are saying.  it all seems to be very accurate--I've put his info to the test.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|People almost never hear the other side of the story.  This was a great movie about two remarkable people very much in love.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|MY KIDS AND I BOTH LOVE THIS GAME. It's very much like temple run. You are able to get plenty of coins to help buy items without using real money.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I want to live in a world just like this book! It was beautiful and I couldn't stop reading it!
B00A88FLI0|5.0|My son is 8 1/2. He loves Lego Ninjago. I cannot tell you how excited he was to get this for Easter. He put it together, by himself(small help from mom) in one day! The giant robot ninja is fun to play with. He is up at his lego table all the time playing with this set. It's well worth the money. I love the attention to detail in the temple. Instructions are all visual and a boy of this age is able to follow along with just a little help.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|This story keeps you guessing from beginning to end.  Just when you think youth have figured it out, wham another twist!

B009AMANBA|5.0|This movie based on a small portion of Doris Kearns Goodwin's excellent novel, \\"Team of Rivals\\", is brought to life with a great screenplay and awesome cast.  For approximately 2 hours we are taken back to a momentous time in history and see a rare glimpse of the man we have come to love and admire.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show is one of my favorite series ever, I've watched it from start to end. It's hilarious, it's got it's share of heart felt moments, it's just a great show! I'll be sad to see it end next season but I can hardly wait to see Ted's future Mrs. Mosby!!
0670026557|5.0|Had the opportunity to hear Dr. Grant at a Knowledge@Wharton conference and what struck me by this unassuming person is his ability to connect to the audience without all the &#34;bravado&#34; you usually have take part-in-parcel with the presentation - none of that was present, as he communicated with audience as a friend, wanting them to achieve their successes through understanding, rather than understanding his success (and the experience is continued in &#34;Give and Take&#34;) - overall, a worthwhile experience from the man, and his book....
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Me and my fiance loved this movie - moving for an animated film, wasn't quite what I expected...it was better.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|I had heard about this movie from a friend, and saw it when we were looking through movies on Amazon.  This movie is especially interesting to music fans, but also just interesting in general.  It follows a musician/composer from the 1970s who released an album that everyone thought would be a big hit, but it hardly sold at all in the U.S.  I don't want to spoil the story, but I can just say it was very interesting to find out what happened.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Thanks to this book, I'm thinking about my own leadership differently, as well as thinking differently about how to enable other women leaders. This was an inspiring, invigorating, *and* relaxing read for a very busy manager and mom. Thank you, Sheryl!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I have read reviews by those who found the novel disjointed and the author's observations on life indistinct. I found that the depictions like 'a flashlight held on a foggy path' to be the beauty of stories lived by these memorable people.<br /><br />In addition, the author did an incredible job with capturing the style of the period -- many of the chapters were written in first person -- of each protagonist. He saw the world through their eyes, and conveyed what he saw to us. Indeed, I cannot remember a recent read in which \\"umwelt\\" was so well rendered.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Really good, couldn't put it down, a very interesting group of characters and interactions.  Glad to see Baldacci has a new protagonist.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As surreal as the circumstances the people in the stories find themselves, the realer their questions, actions, and reactions seem. And the story culminates with a true tale of moral heroism. Well done!
B005S9EJ14|1.0|I do not want to waste my time writing on this garbage. I am amazed that Judi Dench taking the part in the movie???
B001EC3JME|5.0|This little baby is just as advertised. I like the 360° rotation. Holds any size flashlight very tightly which allows forward hands-free movement if necessary. Great for outdoors and comes in handy while hiking a dark trail.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I happened upon this book while searching for a different one. I am so glad I did. It's a fabulous book that pulls you in from the start and keeps you engage  until the very end. It's a must read!
B00BHMF578|2.0|I watched this on a Roku2 and the subtitles kept freezing or going out of sync.  I stopped the movie and resumed it numerous times, then restarted it, and the experience was always the same.  Terrible subtitles that took away from the whole movie experience.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I'm not understanding what is so great about this book.  Plenty of other books in this genre (young adult) are much, much better.  Unless you want to waste money, I would not get it.  It seemed very basic and didn't have much depth.  You could never really understand the character's motivation.  The storyline was weak.
B00C7D3TRO|5.0|I waited for this album from the first time i heard &#34;My songs know what you did in the dark&#34;. Usually the album disappoints when such a great song is released as a single, but this album didnt. Not sure if they saved Rock and Roll but they did save my love of music.
B007DIQC90|5.0|IT IS GREAT! MUCH MORE THAN I EXPECTED. THEY ARE A TALENTED GROUP OF PEOPLE. THE MUSIC AND THE LYRICS ARE VERY GOOD. I AM A COUNTRY GIRL AT HEART, BUT REALLY LIKE THIS.
B001IWUZYK|5.0|Tremendous musical adaptation of the classic Dickens novel.  The casting is spot on, especially the Artful Dodger character.  A great family film.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Really brilliant game plenty of flights on the way brilliant ending I hope there is another like this one. I will keep my eyes out for the next one.
B003VXRD4E|4.0|I loved this adaptation of the Dickens classic, but wish it was a longer mini series.  There were many memorable characters that weren't included in this series.  It left me wanting more.  But brilliantly done.  My favorite scene was Maggie Smith's outstanding portrayal of Betsy Trotwood when she came to young Davy's defense against the odious Murdstones.  That scene alone made the movie worthwhile!
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|would never watch this movie again and would not recommend to anyone I like. this movie bored me. Too far fetched maybe a child would like but I don't think this can keep their attention for very long
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love playing super penguins. It is fun for all ages. I wish it was a lil easier to get all of the characters tho. I don't think I'll ever get them all :-( ,  everyone should get this app. Graphics are wonderful.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|I still had issues trying to see the Blue Ray copy, but eventually it started playing.  I'm not sure what the problem is.  I have other Blue Ray movies with no issues.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The writing was so real.  I felt as though I was living the journey by her side.  She came to St Louis for a book signing.  I was so disappointed it was full, overflowing and so many of us were turned away.  I was eager to meet 'this character' in person.
B003M6WERG|3.0|If the show hadn't received so much praise I would not have continued watching and waiting for it to improve.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a wonderful experience reading, I felt as though I were in the book. Very real depiction of the torment that an adult abused child feels. Simply amazing read, can't wait to read the final chapter.

B001AUKUSG|5.0|Very very Great just love how much energy he puts into his songs.he is and was one of my top artists.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is so well written.  Acting is excellent.  I especially enjoyed the attention to detail in costuming and set dressing.  Awesome series!
0761169253|5.0|I love the straight forward delivery of this book. Complete common sense, presented in a no nonsense, way. Easy to follow, remember, and execute! Great author, great book. I am a fan now!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Looking for a movie on Sat night and wanted something &#34;light&#34; and came across this. I knew of Anna Kendrick and liked her in previous movies and the premise was a little different although the competition reminded me of &#34;Bring it On&#34; She sang and danced and to see someone perform a little out of their element or what is out there previously reinforces how talented she and some of the other folks are. Overall okay movie, nothing to write home about, but served the need after all the things going on regarding the Boston Marathon. Boston proud!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Now I can read whenever I have  a few moments to kill. Very intuitive, easy to use. It syncs with my laptop, desktop and iPod. Can't live without it!
B00656C6KK|5.0|I love the CD.  I have all of DD's records on vinyl.  I also saw all her movies.  As you can tell I am older
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It's good, and fun, but it does get preachy at times. The political beliefs of the author jog into the limelight too often, jarring the reader out of the story. Soldiers have as much right to be political as anyone, of course, but it's not why I bought the book.<br /><br />Other than that, it is really quite good.
B005MLP71Y|5.0|Cute.  As a parent, i just can't find non-violent movies for my 5 year old (even disney movies are PG).  This one can be enjoyed by both parent and kid.  Those are rare, as every parent of a young kid knows.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is the cutest game in the world! The sound effects are adorable! It's very creative. I recommend this for all ages, but it gets very tricky after a while.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|This attachment works great and has 0 problems. Only reason for 4 stars is that the cost does not match the worth of the product.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This is my new favorite movie. It is hilarious and the animation is unbelievably real. If you want to laugh, buy this movie.<br /><br />July 25, 2014 - I still love this movie. Makes me laugh every time I watch it. Can't wait to see Ted 2 when it comes out.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great inside compartments that are adjustable, snug to your body if you need to hike or run with it on, and it has plenty of pockets for other gear you might need. It has stood up well or several outings so far.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the perfect dystopian novel, the perfect combination of war, politics, love and hope.<br />This is by far the best dystopian novel I've ever read. Please write another, Suzanne Collins.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Wanted to see this movie for a long time and since my son is starting his football career. I thought this would be a great film for him to see. I know that they sugar coated some scenes but still it was great inspirational film. Family loved it!!
0887307280|5.0|I bought this just to dig in a little deeper with finance and investing, and it has turned out to be instrumental. Easy to follow, practical applications and it's not all &#34;hype&#34; or bs, it's actually great info. You won't regret this buy.
B007H1HQW0|4.0|I'm in the process of making a chandelier from wine bottles, and this tool has made a difference.  I'm still practicing on spare bottles, but the cut, combined with the hot/cold water breaking process, creates a smooth cut that requires little sanding.  Great little gadget, and affordable.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked this book and it was a nice closing of the story. However, I didn't feel it was as strong as the first 2 books in the series. Sure, there is plenty of action and emotion and death. But it just seemed that &#34;something&#34; was missing from this one as opposed to the first 2 books. The ending was a decent finish to the story but perhaps a bit anticlimactic. Despite that, I would still recommend this book.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|For all of you free gamers, this one is definitely well worth the 1.99! Puzzles within puzzles..within puzzles...within puzzles. You get the hint, and all throughout the frame it gives you little hints, but still let's you figure it out. Fun, fun fun!

B0071XO8RA|1.0|Concept was interesting but I got bogged down in book three.  I tried it because of the comments.  After reading the comments, I thought I was in for something amazing and it wasn't.  Its really the first time the customer comments for amazon have led me wrong.
B00003CXCQ|2.0|This was advertised as being NEW.  It was not new.  Second DVD was scratched.  The shrink wrap was not from factory but shrink wrapped by someone else.  You can tell the difference of shrink wrap when it comes from the original seller (Disney) and the person who sold this on Amazon.  I had to keep the DVD as my granddaughter was crying that she couldn't watch it so I had to watch the first DVD.  I will NOT buy from this seller again.  The item was not as described and false advertisement.  And it cost me over $43.00.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Loved this book. It verified my experiences, but in better words and clarity. Recommend it to anyone pursuing a big idea and getting all caught up in the way they think things should be. Clear, common sense advice with the right amount of sarcasm and humor. No need to rework this book. It's just fine how it turned out. Thank you!
B007SGM084|1.0|This is THE worst book I've ever read!  Where do I begin?  The characters were not likable, the story was so unbelievable. It reads like bad fan fiction and goes on and on forever...<br /><br />The sex in the book was stupid, this innocent college girl jumps right into submissive sex feet first with a relative stranger and becomes the object that this sadistic billionaire can't live without.<br /><br />This set of books are so bad that they should owe stars.  I'm glad I got this from the library and did't waste my money on it.

0374531269|4.0|This book was truly amazing. I love beginning stories that are based on a true story because it adds such a raw and intimate feel about it, knowing that this actually happened to someone. The brave boy, Ishmael became an unwilling soldier during a  war at a very young age.  One of the saddest parts for me was when he was fully brainwashed and began killing and taking drugs to numb his pain. Regarding the females in this book, I thought it was heartbreaking that almost all of them in the book were raped or killed/mistreated. It would be so sad to be forced into this type of lifestyle and have no choice but to live it. You compare our lifestyle to this and it is shocking and so unfair. One of my favorite elements of the book was the detail the author went into. Even though it was often sad and depressing, he told the story so well that you could imagine it perfectly. Reading the story was hard and I could not imagine what it would be like to go through something like this.<br />I would recommend this book for any classes that relate to this story because it is so touching. Regarding globalization, it allowed me to really look at my life and realize how lucky we truly are. The women in this story had to go through some horrible times along with the men and children. This story really gives you a different perspective on how things could potentially be and I am glad I read it.

B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Good afternoon.<br /><br />I ordered Lincoln  last night and about 3/4 of the way through the movie it began skipping (video and audio) like a scratched DVD. I live in a studio and have more then enough Wi-Fi power to stream HD movies (see below, I've done in the past w/ zero problem from Amazon.)<br /><br />Is there anyway I could get this $5 credit back or just allow me to rent another movie &#34;on the house&#34;... presuming this won't be a re-occuring problem?<br /><br />Thankn you,<br /><br />Alex

0307341577|5.0|I loved this book. I read Gone Girl first and shortly after read this one. I love how the writer takes you through each characters perspective and draws you in so much. Just when you think you know what is going to happen things change. Like someone else wrote here there are no warm sweet moments but the story is great. I couldn't put it down!

B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Upbeat, but not nervous, twitchy or too fast.  Witty lyrics, not repetitious, a blessing for music lovers who listen to the words.  No heavy-handed social commentary (Jack Johnson) and they actually play their instruments instead of relying on studio post-production.  If you like Mumford and Sons, Vampire Weekend or the Comettes, you'll enjoy this album.

0446572993|5.0|The Innocent was just another amazing book by Baldacci.  He never disappoints.  I love his style of writing, his characters, his story lines and just everything.  Beware however, because when reading anything by David Baldacci you cannot put the book down.  All I want to do is keep reading!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game.  It keeps him occupied on long trips in the car.  We download a lot of free games, but this one was worth purchasing.  Very fun and helps with his creativitiy.
0446573019|5.0|I love David Baldacci's style of writing and his story lines are terrific.  Zero Line had great characters and as usual it was a page-turner.  I never want to put his books down.  Baldacci amazes me!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I like the game but it keeps freezing and I have to start it over to keep playing. I would really like it off someone would fix it. Other than that I pretty much think it's a great game.

B008Q09K2U|1.0|I all sounded so good in the sample I downloaded - it was building up to be something good.  And guess what, I have read 68% of the book and I am still waiting for something to happen - but boy, have I been educated about Yemen because it is absolutely a travel guide in the guise of a thriller.  Sadly it became so over the top I am flicking through the chapters and find 4 chapters later they are still having a conversation about a tribe, or a city, or something else.  Give me some action, but sadly the only action I can see coming is more of the same.  Total disappointment.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Thank you so much for writing this wonderful book which I know will be with me for a very long time. I pray your life is a happy one, dear author, and that you have at least another 1 or 2 more marvelous stories to share with us and the world.
B008OOYALE|5.0|My granddaughter and I love to sit and raise these baby dragons. I have always been a big fan of dragons. Now so is Jasmine, my 9 yr. Old granddaughter. She is 11 yrs. old now and we are still playing only she has her own game on her Kindle. So does her sister who is ten yrs. old with her Kindle.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|When I began this book I thought I was going to really enjoy it.  There was a lot of description, but believed at the time it was laying the ground for the events that would unfold.  Sadly, the whole book was like that.  There was minimal action and lots of unimportant details.  The characters moved from England to France and to the United States, but nothing much happened in any country.  If this book were not 600 pages, I might consider reading the next one in the series.  However, I don't trust that I won't give up too many hours for another disappointment.
B00913P6G0|4.0|Well according to my dude who is incarcerated I had it sent to him the only problem was the case was shattered but besides that it was cool

B008K6HN8I|5.0|I really enjoy this product. Does a wonderful job of file renaming, relocating, etc.<br /><br />Basically can move pictures to various folders which you create to organize the pics. Handles deletion and most common file functions. More like the file explorer on a PC than the built in picture handler.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|Very engaging movie. Gerard as usual is great! The actor that played Jay Moriarty is amazing! Was interested in watching it for the cinematography, but was nicely surprised by the movie.
B00985E3UG|5.0|It is easy to be cynical about &#34;corporate America&#34; and its greedy ends.  Profit is everything; the &#34;public interest&#34; be damned.  However, Michael Moss provides factual data on how the food industry &#34;knowingly&#34; adds salt, sugar and fat to our foods despite knowledge indicating the dangers of those specific food components.  Too late do several corporate food executives turn against the very foods they helped to create and promote.  This is a sad tale of unbridled avarice.  When it comes to food, we indeed need to &#34;get back to basics.&#34;

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Yes it may require additional funds depending on how much you play but I love it. User friendly. Join the fun
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie is definitely a epic!  Wonderful storyline to include great acting.  Would definitely recommended to those who believe in the power love with adversity.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Engaging characters. Maximus, the horse with attitude, got the whole family to laugh, even the disaffected 16 year old.<br />Love it that the helpless princess is NOT AT ALL helpless, she's a force.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game needs:<br />Caves.  Lava<br />More mobs. Mine carts and tracks<br />Day/Night control in creative<br />And other than that' it's epic.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I found this book beyond interesting.  It was almost like a mystery, a page-turner.  One really could identify with the author's problems and coming to terms with herself.  She conveys the physical trials and tribulations in a sometimes hostile environment to great effect.  I'd enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|'Very good series. I really like it very mucho. I have been watching previous seasons and no doubt that is wonderful
B005MHI0QM|5.0|I am so thankful that Anne wrote this! It's sad but it is a part of history. Glad I read it again.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this storybook classic! There are many differences between the book and the movie. You get background stories and more characters and places to imagine. The reason I gave this story four stars is because the dialogue was sometimes dull and at times it felt like the dialogue was a filler.
B008FOB124|5.0|Okay, I'm biased. I LOVE Dead Can Dance! I went to their concert on Monday April 15th @ Davies Symphony in San Francisco...and months before @ the Greek theatre in Berkeley. Let me tell you, the CD is superb, every song....BUT they sound even better in concert. I'm hoping DCD comes back to the Bay Area. Until then, this CD will have to do. It's beautiful, relaxing, epic. :)

B003G4W49C|4.0|At first I thought the writing was weak, but gradually started enjoying it, and then got to a point where I didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />It's a good story.<br /><br />Ender's Game reminds me of The Hunger Games in some ways. It's an enjoyable read.
1439152802|5.0|My fellow Book Club members agree.  I don't want to give any of the story away, but the writing is so good, you feel as though you are right there in the action. I first read this on my Kindle and immediately upon finishing it I ran to the store and bought the hardcopy.  I am rereading the hard copy and enjoying it as much or more the second time around.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was an excellent read and is worth every word. I love the beginning middle and the end. Can't wait for the movies
B000000ORE|4.0|Heavier than Mechanical Resonance!  Although the booklet (like Mechanical Resonance) does not contain the lyrics, it does have the lead guitar credits for each song.  However, (like Mechanical Resonance) the CD was recorded from the band's point of view, not the audience's.  What I mean is when you seem them live Frank is on your right and Tommy is on your left.  However the channels are switched from that.  Tommy is in the right channel and Frank is in the left.  I don't know why bands do that.<br /><br />I saw them live on this tour back in 89 and they played most of the album live (tracks 1-11).  Very down to earth blue collar ROCK!
0345803485|2.0|It is a book that you will either love or hate. I paid $9.99 for this book or I would not have finished it. I made myself finish because I bought it. There is no story other than sex and it wasn't even very good. The whole book made me mad and I disliked Christian Grey. I didn't like Ana very much at the beginning but started liking her towards the middle/end. I just could not get into this book. I skimmed over pages at the end because I just wanted to be done.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I finished this book at 2am last night. My eyes are puffy and swollen this morning but well worth it. I loved this book! I cried I think the last quarter of the book. I just had to finish it. 5 GIANT STARS from me. So far this is my favorite book of the year! Let me just say I'm an emotional reader. I can cry at any sad scene but this book broke my heart. I felt so drawn to Sky's character she was such a strong women and I loved her. I was pulled in from the very beginning and was dreading a little when Holder was showing that he was a little stalker-ish and had a temper. I don't relate well to those kind of male characters and I tend to be a bit harsh on my ratings if I don't think the lead guy is all that worthy of my heroine. Sky stood her ground with Holder and didn't put up with his crap and let him know he was in the wrong. I loved that Sky didn't just run into his arms even though she wanted too. As the story progressed the more Holder grew on me and by the middle of the book I think I was just as infatuated with him as Sky was. There were times I found the story a little bit predictable I knew things that would happen in the near future. They did happen just not how I was expecting them. I loved it and it will be a book that I will remember for a very long time!

0061950726|5.0|Molly is a 17 year old girl who has been bounced around the social services system for years.  Her current foster placement is safe, but she still does not fit in.  When she is forced to do community service hours, she meets Vivian, a 91 year old woman who was an orphan herself.  Over the course of time, Molly learns that despite their age difference, she and Vivian have much in common.  And Vivian finally shares her story with someone, after all these years.<br /><br />If I had to choose a phrase to describe this book, I would choose \\"heartbreakingly beautiful\\".  The story is so touching, with its ups and downs.  I felt really emotionally connected to this book, despite the fact that it took me a bit of time to get into it.  I loved the historical nature of the story, surrounding the orphan trains in the early part of the 20th century, and following Vivian's life through various parts of history.  I also like the intertwining nature of both Molly and Vivian's stories.  I found the dual timelines deftly executed, and the result is a story that is seamless, even though it covers so many decades.<br /><br />I felt very attached to both Molly and Vivian as characters.  I wanted to defend them, to comfort them, and to help them have a better life.  I know that sounds silly, since they are merely characters in a book.  However, the fact remains that these characters are modeled after true stories; people really do go through these kinds of things.  As characters, both women were richly developed.  I loved seeing such strong female characters, able to persevere through hardships and not allow themselves to become victims.<br /><br />While the story deals with a few rough topics (abuse, drugs/alcohol, death), I think this would actually be a great book for mature young adults who are interested in history.  I also feel like many adult fans of historical fiction and contemporary fiction will enjoy the book.  It certainly had a tremendous impact on me.<br /><br />I received a review copy courtesy of TLC Book Tours in exchange for my honest review.a review copy courtesy of TLC Book Tours in exchange for my honest review.

076790592X|3.0|This was a cute story about a man who learns to appreciate the little things in life by visiting Morrie who is dying.  But it was a little too hallmark-cardy of a story for me.  Morrie was proud of his philosophical quotes, but I'm not sure what his philosophy was other than some watered down golden-rule-be-happyism.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I just recently started getting into Daft Punk and I love them! This song (and from what I read, the whole album) is a departure from the style of their earlier body of work, but it's no less amazing. This song brings disco into the modern era and gives us something fresh and hip to enjoy. I can (and sometimes do) listen to this song on repeat for an hour straight - it's that good!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter and her exact words where it was absolutely awesome. She loved it so that means she will be bugging my often to play on my tablet since hers has broken. Although I did get a great big hug and kiss out of the deal.

B00CBKLO52|5.0|I think this game is awsome but all right because when you buy it you have to add on to the selection of planes. You can all so get it for the real computer but it is $40. I like it to because it gives you a crapy plane model. It also comes with boats and helicopters.

B009AP2G26|3.0|I don't hate the new season but it isn't up I pat with the previous seasons. I would say the bouncing between NY and Lima, OH is overwhelming at times.  It's raunchier than before, not as kid friendly.
B0012GMUIG|5.0|I purchased the MP3's to transfer to flash drive.  Many great live performances of Billy Joel's classic hits.  If you appreciate his studio cuts you should love the live renditions.

0061122416|3.0|More inspirational or morality tale than novel, unfortunately not what I was looking for, though certainly well written enough that I stuck with it to the end.  Nevertheless the book has been read by millions and provided many with encouragement and insight --  mostly about pursuing your calling in life (one's Personal Legend and not giving up).<br />\\"The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.\\"  (representing the precious things in your own life at the moment, in my interpretation.<br />The boy here discovers through the alchemist he meets why men have failed to turn metal into gold:  \\"They were looking only for gold.  They were seeking the treasure of their Personal Legend, without wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend.  He also notes, that \\"when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.:<br />\\"One is loved because one is loved.  No reason is needed for loving.\\"<br />I was more impressed by the author's own life, being committed to a mental institution by his parents because at seventeen he was more interested in literature than persuing a path with the church.  Later he was kidnapped and tortured by a group of paramilitaries for belonging to an alternative society that defended the right to free expression.
0307387178|4.0|I loved the book except for when the author tells his story. I didn't buy the book to read about his life so I really didn't like the chapters about him.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is one of the better Adventure/Hidden Object games out there.  The story is good and the gameplay is fun.  It is not too hard or easy.  My only criticism would be that it is a tad too short.  I did not reduce the rating, however, because of the cost of the game is quite reasonable.  I hope to see more like this one.
B001USHRCK|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my 8 year old. He absolutely loves it. Its so detailed! I grew up playing legos and this is similar to older sets. There are no numbered bags, the instructions have more steps per page. I didn't mind though. I just dumped all 20 something bags out and got sorting. I freaking love legos! This goes well with the Lego Lord of the Rings sets. We figure it can be Dale or one of the other towns. :)

B000BVMAJ2|4.0|This toy is fun and durable, but unfortunately doesn't keep my two-year-old son's attention too long. Perhaps he will find them more interesting as he develops mentally.

B009AMANBA|5.0|A star-studded cast has been gathered for this amazing picture from Shephen Spielberg.<br /><br />The time is January, 1865.  President Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) has been re-elected and is awaiting inauguration. Lincoln wishes to add the 13th amendment to the Constitution which would abolish slavery. It is Lincoln's hope to pass the amendment before the inauguration.  Acting on information from Secretary of State Seward (David Strathairn), Lincoln learns that he will need 20 Democratic votes to pass the amendment.  Lincoln and Seward target several lame-duck congressmen who will be out of office in the hopes of gaining their vote for the amendment.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lincoln's wife Mary (Sally Field) is still mourning the death of son Willie.  To make matters even more difficult for her, her son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) wants to enlist in the army.  This is almost too much for Mary to handle.<br /><br />The action in Congress continues to boil as the vote draws near.  Plus, the bloody Civil War rages on.  A delegation has been sent from the Confederacy to Washington to meet with Lincoln to see if a peace settlement could be arranged.  But this delegation could threaten the congressional vote on the 13th amendment.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of American history, and I found \\"Lincoln\\" to be compelling and dramatic.  Spielberg has done a masterful job of assembling a fine cast of actors.  Daniel Day-Lewis was the perfect choice for Lincoln, and Sally Field does an equally impressive job as Mary Todd Lincoln.  Of course, I can't forget Tommy Lee Jones as the racial-equality congressman Thaddeus Stevens.  I thought the movie was historically accurate, and I'm glad Spielberg chose to focus on the last 4 months of Lincoln's time in office.  It was interesting for me to see the battle over passage of the 13th amendment and how some of the political manuvering took place.<br /><br />I give \\"Lincoln\\" my highest recommendation.  Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent and the story is historically correct.  Don't miss this fine film about the final four months of our 16th President.ry is historically correct.  Don't miss this fine film about the final four months of our 16th President.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|An amazing book with a great message, appropriate for all ages!  I can't wait to share this with my children.
B008602KQI|2.0|It's one of those movies that helps book fans see their creative imaginations come alive; however, the story line is predictable and the depth of the characters have been reduced to caricatures of good, bad, weak and strong.  Compared to the Rowling novels, where the author vigilantly protected the transference of her character from printed word to celluloid, it appears that Collins was quite satisfied simply with a hollywood check.
B0016A2FFG|4.0|Exactly what you would expect from Al Green. An international star at the top of their game. It would be more interesting if a crazy producer remixed the arrangements  much like Easy-Mo-Bee did with Mile Davis on 1992's DooBop
0316056898|3.0|Bossypants is a nice read if you like to read about movie and TV personalities and their personal and professional experiences. The book follows her life from childhood to her current position with 30 Rock. It moves briskly along without too much introspection. There is some attempt at humor but it falls short. The best chapter in my view is where she responds to critics.  This book is the sort of thing you can read through quickly while on a trip or relaxing. It is not something that requires serious attention.  There are some interesting insights about females in comedy but not much that will enlighten you. Obviously a lot of people have read it and liked it and my three star rating should not be seen as a negative.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|It won't even download it sucks do not download on a kindle fire  because it will not work on a kindle fire

0385349831|5.0|Like The Prophet, Thus Spoke Zarasustra, and other books based more on ideas than on story, this book is bound to be a classic read for years by people in search of a deeper understanding and purpose in life and meaning.  I was very impressed with this book and enjoyed it a lot.  Paulo Coehlo has been one of my  favorite authors for awhile, but, some of his books are hit and miss.  This book is a hit right out of the park.  You will not finish this book looking at the world the same way when you started it.  My favorite line is, \\"Live Every Day like It's Your First.\\"<br /><br />I have often rejected the school of thought to live each day like it's your last.  I knew too many drug addicts, too many alcoholics, who did exactly that.  Live Every Day Like It's Your First says to me that you should look at every day with the glory and beauty and amazement that exist out in the world.  Imagine waking up to the person that you love and looking at them like you did the very first time you realized you were in love with this person.  Imagine it's the first time your eyes locked.  Imagine it's the first time after your first kiss.  If you looked at that person like that every day, how much better a relationship would you have.<br /><br />This book is amazing.  It's got a lot of great information and a lot of great thoughts.  Take a moment and enjoy them.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Got sucked into this moving per my wife's recommendation.  Initially, it seemed a bit slow, but it grew on me as the movie progresses.  I ended up liking it.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|As a fan of this book and first read it when I was 11 years old, I must say I am a bit disappointed again with the choice of actors for the lead roles. Whilst not questioning their great acting skills and popularity around the world, they do not fit into the physical make up of the characters in the book. For example, the main character, Jean valjean, was described as a heavily build, with a thick set body (that was why he had that enormous strength) man. Huge Jackman character is too tall and slender in built in constrast. The older Cossette was just 18 years old when he met Marius, whereas Amanda Seyfried is twice her age in this movie. It does put a damper to my expectations. I know the producers and financial backers of the movie are keen to ensure that the project is a financial success and therefore sought well known actors to fill in the top roles, but I and many others who love the book, are most keen to see that the lead characters are portrayed in accordance to the author's description to give authenticity to the project. The singing, music and set are to my expectations though.
B008JFUO36|4.0|Michael Phillips, movie reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, didn't much care for this film. That I respect his work a lot put me in a position. Do I see it on the big screen or wait for the DVD release? I forked over me money at the cinema and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Earth was attacked by some aliens. We won the war but killed the planet in the process. Earth folk have migrated to Titan and Jack, (Tom Cruise) and his controller cum sidekick Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are left behind to maintain the flying drones that guard the massive Hydrogen converters against attack by the scavengers, those who chose not to go to Titan. Jack also has a recurring dream of a particular woman who he somehow thinks he might know. Jack gets caught by the scavengers and he finds out the world might not be set up quite the way he was told.<br /><br />OK. OK. Yes there are some things that were borrowed. And some other things that should throw up red flags for the viewer early on. But this is still a heck of a watch. The director's, Joseph Kosinski, first outing, \\"Tron Legacy\\", was not really very good. He's taken a huge leap forward here. This is a sweeping film with large scope, great camera movement and faster, more assured, pacing. I did not know where the story was headed and that's a good thing. Too often a movie telegraphs itself. This looked good, had great sets, good effects, good sound, music, editing and all the other production values in line with a project this size. Cruise is aging well. He plays a somewhat cocky character but not quite as severe as \\"Top Gun's\\" Maverick. Olga Kurylenko is a rising star, and her sweet, appeal works well here. Morgan Freeman is becoming Morgan Freeman so there aren't any real surprises there.<br /><br />I was a bit confused on some aspects of the script but my guess is they'd be cleared up with a second viewing. But if you are a big fan of big sci-fi movies, this should fill your plate.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I like the movie and the plot . It stays along the same lines as the book but see the movie first
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|I've never heard of this composer (or composers), but as I was watching the movie I new I had to get the score.  It has a perfect, sometimes lonely sound, as well as awesome action cues.  You won't be disappointed.

B004UHL9EK|3.0|Seems like a decent enough stopwatch app. Appears to be accurate anyway. The timer and alarm are very easy to set. I would like the option to have the alarm set to a random MP3 though. The biggest knock against this app is that the volume setting is too coarse. It changes in multiples of 14. At its lowest audible setting of 14, it is way too loud and would likely give me a heart attack. It would certainly wake my wife. This might not be a problem for a heavy sleeper but it's a deal breaker for me. Fix that, earn star. Wake me up on time for a week and I'll give you 5.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game. Very enjoyable. The only complaint I have is when new things open I have to wait to play them. I always play on my kindle fire or phone. Would be nice to get updates sooner.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Django Unchained is a very gratifying movie, a unique western that almost deserves its own category as both an entertainment piece and also an educational tool. It is in a lot of ways standard Tarantino fare with the obligatory action scenes and blood but it also grows into something more. It's very much a man against the system story. But, as the tale unfolds, it goes beyond the predictable gory narrative and becomes an allegory of revenge, integrity and social ignorance. It has funny, satirical moments as well as scenes where you, like the good guys, have trouble holding in your rage at what you are seeing. All things said, it may very well be the best movie Tarantino has ever directed.<br /><br />  In brief and without giving up too much plot information, this movie is about a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who was separated from his wife by his master as a form of punishment common in the Antebellum South. As we meet our soon to be hero, he is without hope and has all but given up on everything. Everything begins to change when a former dentist-turned-bounty-hunter named Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) finds him and through a witty and hilarious scene frees him, formatively then, eventually, in the literal and legal way. The two quickly become friends and partners as Django learns to be a bounty hunter. Eventually, the two hatch a plan to find and free Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). To do so, they have to find a way to trick the maliciously evil slave owner and slave fighter Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Worse yet, among the various miscreants and thieves in Candie's employ is his seeming butler and slave boss Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), who is his equal in cruelty and even sneakier and more suspicious of everyone than he is. The acting is, in all cases, superb and powerful. How these men and women brought this story to life is a true marvel and truly makes you feel like you are yourself transported back in time.<br /><br />  The thing that I value the highest about this movie, above even the masterful performances and stunning scenery, is that it is both entertaining as an action-western but also educational. Much like the hardships of the Great Depression, World War II and the price paid by the Greatest Generation to ensure everything that Americans have today, the more years that pass under the bridge the more distant the days of slavery become. The more removed we become from the evil of those times, the more easily we as a society forget what slavery meant and what it was. While Django Unchained is not completely historically accurate, the portrayal of the way blacks were treated in those days is absolutely true to the nature of the beast. The slave owners convey a dedication to being vicious, heartless and cruel. They treat their slaves as less than property, less than people, less even than valuable livestock. The slaves live and die at the whim of these masters, whose only distinguishing skills are their talents at inflicting suffering and their deference to their own shortcomings. For instance, DiCaprio's character, Candie, is French but doesn't speak his own tongue and even gets offended when that language is brought up. While perhaps not suitable for small children, this movie definitely entertains while also educating a post-Roots generation. It reminds us to value the freedoms that we have today.<br /><br />  Obviously, being a Tarantino movie, this isn't just a satire, comedy or revenge tale. It's definitely an action flick and, loyal to his fans, Tarantino delivers many fast-paced fight scenes, many with hysterical twists to them. For instance, I love the scene where Tarantino is abruptly blown up by dynamite. The way Tarantino always appears in his own films is reminiscent of the Great Masters, the great artists of yesteryear who had a tendency to always paint themselves into their masterpieces. To find the scene that I am talking about you just need to watch the movie - it is well worththe effort. The film is well paced, not spending too much time on Act I where Django is introduced nor on Act II where he transitions into a hero-in-training. It builds up to a climactic Act III, which is an all-out gun battle (several actually) where Django finally gets revenge on the people who hurt him, tortured his one true love and at last killed his one and only friend. Whatever else it does, this movie will please fans of both the Kill Bill films, classic westerns and also the old spaghetti westerns, which it almost seems to pay tribute to in simple terms of the number of fight scenes.<br /><br />  As to picture and sound quality, these are near perfect like most new releases. The video was encoded perfectly in 1080p and I do not recall any pixel problems at any point. This was a great thing given the dramatic cinematography which included old west town sets, deep forests, mountains covered in snow, rolling plains, desert mountains and southern plantation houses. An epic film deserves epic b-roll and Django delivers. The extras that come with the Blu-ray release are tasteful and appropriate, adding some depth and background to the film. These include such discussions as the reimagining of spaghetti westerns and such. All around, these aspects of the release are very good.<br /><br />  In summary, I highly recommend this movie. It educates and entertains which makes it a value to all generations and also marks a pinnacle of achievement for both its director and the actors who made it come to life. I cannot speak highly enough of the work they put into this. The best thing you can do is give it a try if you haven't already. It will make you laugh, and you may cry, but you will certainly raise your hands and cheer for the hero before it is over.the effort.

B00005V9HH|5.0|I enjoyed it, but find the end a little difficult to swallow. Still fine acting and the suspense holds for most of the movie.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Words cannot express my love for Slammed. Everything about this novel was spectacular. I feel in love with the characters almost instantly and just kept wanting more and more. I felt like I was living life along with Will and Lake and everything that they felt I would feel too. So much intensity but in such a good way. This isn't just a story about true love but a story about the hardships of life and understanding how to overcome those tough spots and the feeling that love can help to overcome these obstacles. I recommend this book to everyone! Seriously one of the best books I have read in a while.
B00008RH3L|5.0|I love the feel to this and I would basically say, watch it, you will be entertained. I loved the acting and had a little laugh at some of the shooting scenes. It is fascinating to see how they did this, really worth watching.

1401324649|4.0|The 100 Year Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window is a good book overall, but for me I was disappointed when we left the really fun eccentric old man on the run from his nursing/retirement home adventure and relived his life up to then.  There was nothing wrong with the flashback life scenes, just for me they weren't as interesting as the fugitive events.  The flashback life also forced you to develop more of an opinion of Allan than you had when he was simply an old man on the run who didn't give a stuff what anyone else thought.  To be honest I liked him less as a young man than an old man.  But the tale is what it is, and it's still a worthwhile and fun read, sort of emulates a bit of Forrest Gump (Winston Groom's novel not the movie) in its cartoon style version of reality setting.  The over descriptive sentences for me worked well, but may become a bit irritating for some, I don't think an author with English as a first language would get away with that though, but I think it added to the uniqueness of the Swede author's tale.<br /><br />I'd definitely read further books by this author.  If you like eccentric elderly character led fiction also check out the [[ASIN:B0025VJV98 Retirement Homes Are Murder]] series by Mike Befeler and T Dawn Richard's [[ASIN:159414060X May List series]], both with feisty elderly retirement home inhabitants who like Allen, don't think they belong there either and aren't just going to follow the rules.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I am not saying that this film is bad.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  But it is a real teat-jerker because Healy Joel Osment is the perfect choice for the part that he plays and he plays that part extremely and most convincingly well.  During his childhood acting period, his cute, boyish innocence radiates.  In the Woods scene where his adopted mother abandons him to the world with only his teddy bear for company, if you are the sentimental type, you'll go through a box of hankies.  As a man, I never thought that a scene like that would grab me so.  Jude Law as android &#34;Gigolo Joe,&#34; is the perfect co-star to little Osment.  This is a feel-good movie for the entire family and worth your time to watch.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Ryan Reynolds is always fun, and this was certainly an engaging and fun movie. They got a lot right, but hit a lot of false notes as well. There is potential for a better sequel, as is often the case with super hero movies (second time's the charm).
B0001ZXM54|5.0|zz top is great.  this cd has got many great songs.  some I never heard before. I absolutely love it.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|This was a gift for my grandson.  I cannot rate it as I'm not a Batman fan, but  it was delivered as promised and my grandson loved it.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|i bought this to make things out of bottle and it sucks i couldnt get it to even get close to working the videos make it look easy but its not i tryed every way in every video on you tube and it still didn't work. don't dont waste you time and money on this
B00447L4JG|1.0|This was bought as a Christmas present for my grandson, however, I've seen this movie and it's really cute.  It's all about  how Jack Skeleton wanders into Christmas and decides he's tired of just Halloween and scaring people and he wants to help Santa with Christmas.  Mayhem occurs as Jack only knows Halloween and the presents he delivers are not exactly what kids expect!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer rocks love it! At first i thought i wouldnt like it but then i got better and better at it and now i love it. It doesnt disappoint if you see a bad review their lying.
B00BR4QNJ0|3.0|This one you can use the tea jars unlike the first. Not sure what the soul jar is used for though.  Fun to play.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|All women who work and consider their job a career need to read this.  Sheryl has some great insight on how women interact in the workplace and at home that may hinder career trajectory.  I loved this - but I would add that I think women's working life is not going to change by just what women do.  Sheryl had several men that helped her along the way - and I don't think she considers that not every woman has that advantage.  I don't think Sheryl ever had a woman as a boss because I think that would have changed her perception greatly.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|a must own for dinner time with the family ! very sturdy package and good video quality, some portuions of the documental are not in HD due to the locations where it was shot.
B008DKBO8G|4.0|The sleeve works perfectly. Only one small negative. I wish it had a loop inside the fold for my stylus.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|The look of the film, the acting, production values and artistic style makes this film a must own regardless of your beliefs. Extremely violent, beautifully acted and presented. I love this movie.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I enjoy the story line. the graphics are nice. it. is not too difficult but is enough challenge to keep your interest. I finished the game and am now going back to get three stars for each level.

B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I was able to find some information on my topic, but disliked having to choose a category for my search. My query was on Ba, Ka, and Akh, the states of the soul in ancient Egypt. I was directed to various scholarly books. All I could read were the synapses of the books, but never got past a synopsis. I was disappointed.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|So I may have started reading this book around midnight last night and finished at 4AM...I mean, may have.<br /><br />Slammed - what a great little NA/YA title this was.<br /><br />Layken \\"Lake\\" and Will have &lt;u> great &lt;/u> chemistry.  Colleen does such a good job writing these two and their struggle to be together/ stay apart.<br /><br />The story is taken from a simple boy meets girl story with complex ethical issues, tragic family backgrounds and the poetry.<br /><br />Oh my, the poetry slams rock! The verses were touching, romantic, hilarious and all that a poetry slam should be.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and go out and get Slammed.
0399157565|1.0|Time to fire Patricia Cornwell's editor and bring back the old Scarpetta.  I couldn't believe all the missed opportunities to build on the complex characters she develops, and then just have them fade out.  And to have the culprit not discovered by forensic methods was just too much.  The killer shows up because Kay is meddling too much?  Oh please! And then Cornwell destroys the only possible person (Doug) that would make me consider reading Bone Bed 2.<br /><br />What was all the courtroom intrigue all about?  What is the explanation?  Who cares if nobody likes Lucy -- neither do I.<br /><br />That's it for me -- no more Scarpettas -- unless Cornwell decides her novels are not to be used as her personal bully pulpit for the unfairness of the women's plight of growing old and no longer attractive to the alpha males.  Get over it!

B0094OLFUW|5.0|Such a chill album.  I find myself looking for excuses to drive so that I can listen to this CD.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I would reccommend it to dog lover's or anyone who enjoys pondering over the possibility of considering intangible ideas could actually have truth or meaning.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|Horrible look at what life is like for the average couple at midlife.  The movie droned on with funny snippets along the way, but not enough to keep my attention. This movie was more depressing than funny. Don't bother seeing this one. Disappointing Apatow movie, and I'm a fan.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|Bought it for grandson,He's three and thinks he is the real Buzz Lightyear. He knows every word by heart, lol.
B003L20IJM|5.0|We bought this for our four year old twins to watch on one of our road trips. They seemed to really enjoy it. I had a chance to watch it when we got home and thought it was great movie also and I'm a 32 year old dad! Would recommend
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I really like the sound of Phillip Phillips. His music is calm and up lifting to listen to. I have worn this CD out and I think my Iphone is tired of hearing it as well, I am not
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Finally the return of excellent music. When this band called it quits a few years ago I was devastated. But in this triumphant return we get a taste of the brand new and more mature Fall Out Boy. I love all the songs. I listen to this record at least three times a day because there is something here that wasn't here before and I like it. Buy it, buy it a million times because these guys deserve their credit.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I really like the book. All the descriptions of what Chris goes through is awesome. I particularly like the inputs from his wife on different parts of the book. Good read electronically
B002A9VJ40|5.0|C'mon it's Top Gun. What isn't there to love? It's an 80's movie about fighter jets and the cocky pilots who fly them. Not to mention there is a really simple soundtrack. Everyone can remember 3 songs right? I like this movie because its easy to like.
B000FC11A6|4.0|I'm not a critic so I won't get all long-winded. Stephenson 's books are awesome. I've read that some think he's too \\"wordy\\"....  NOT!
B00AZKCU7G|4.0|This movie was as good as everybody said it would be.  It was a little slow, but the perfomances are worth it.
B007ELLDFO|5.0|It takes longer than you might initially think to get through this book.  I found myself slowing down and going back to re-read some passages, so as not miss any of the fabulous dark humor.  The dry wit of the author and the characters of Miss Brodie and Sandy is what makes this book a jewel. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys cerebral humor in fiction.
B008035H16|3.0|It's a great reading, very crisp and done in a different ( comical ) way. My expectations from this book was more :-(
B00125WAWS|5.0|This is a very touching DVD. It touches many areas of the emotions.<br />Powerful movie to have in your collection. The movie is based  on a<br />story of the Wiley College during the 1930s. Not all the movie is based<br />on the same facts but close enough to  get the point across.
B00555X8OA|4.0|If you're not familiar to the subject, you're be shocked, maybe scared of what you learn.<br />It was not easy reading, but is useful information.

B003MC5N28|3.0|I enjoyed the book and the setting. Especially the details of the community. However I wanted more of Jonas and Gabe journey and what happens to them.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This book is amazing!  Loved it so much. He is such a good writer that you as a reader feel like you are one of the characters. (This review was actually posted by my teenaged daughter; but I would also recommend this classic.)
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Movie starts with full frontal nudity for about 5 min.<br />Filthy language through-out the whole movie.<br />All the airplane action is at the beginning.<br />But it does show what addiction does to a person.<br />It shows what denial does to a person.<br />The message is a 5*  but the movie is a 1* .
B000026OHN|5.0|This recording should be in every classical music collection. Richter's work is perfect The recording quality is great , particularly considering it was done in 1970.

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Daniel Craig is not as handsome as some of the other &#34;Bonds&#34; but is just as sophisticated. This does reflect back on the old Bond movies and closes some books and loose ends.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|And after watching, it's hard to believe he never gained nationwide attention at least, even if not nationwide fame. Great documentary that also shows an interesting side of South African history.
0393343405|5.0|We had a great discussion and this book was perfect for a discussion.  Really taught us a lot and for example  learned that thre word epicurean is usually used incorrectly  Could go on, but feel you should read the book.
B00999DFP0|5.0|The big bang theory is the funniest show on TV right now and it makes fun of everyone whether they be a nerd or not.
B00CEIGYAG|3.0|First, I will say that I do see how this can be classified as a good song, however I was not a believer at first. When I think of Daft Punk, I think of great hits like Harder Better Faster Stronger. You know, songs that have an electronic feel to them. This new song Get Lucky doesn't feature as much of electronic elements as I hoped for. I also feel it would be very awkward to dance to. What it does provide is a (un?)healthy dose of Pharrell Williams. I don't follow pop music of whatever genre he does on his own, but his voice isn't bad. What is bad is the lyrics about \\"getting lucky.\\" I don't want to hear about some guy trying to have sex with someone. It does start to feel more like Daft Punk after about 2:30. It's definitely my favorite part of the song when Pharrell shuts up. I do still have high hopes for the album and wonder if this song was chosen as a single simply because it would be guaranteed radio play. Give me back that Robot Rock!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|It follows the books pretty well. It is action packed and the actors are perfect for their roles. Great director!
B009715OAO|5.0|The Best track from Elysium. Catchy lyrics and a fun pop vibe, make me want to strut my stuff again!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Basic period piece.  Nice costumes.  Characters were thin.  The movie was no more broad than the 13th amendment (emancipation) with a little bit of craziness from Mary Todd.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love Game of thrones.  Best series on TV now.  Watch if you can the best show on TV by far.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|A longer movie than most and the ideas it proposes are progressive and do a great job of explaining how a potential alien race would contact earth. If you are conservatively religious this may not be the movie for you but if you are open to new things and like a good story that is mostly based on a sound scientific basis then you will most likely enjoy Contact.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Hugh Jackman was brilliant and what can you say about Ann that has not already been said. It's a movie you can watch over and over again.
0307595579|5.0|A great read I would recommend it to all my friends. Some trilogies lost me halfway but Larsson's Millennium captivated me from the first to the last book.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Very good tv show highly recommend the characters are very good and the storyline is very interesting there are 16 episodes each episodes are unique. The ending is very good. Can't wait for season 3
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I don't play it often because it takes too long to accomplish anything but my husband enjoys it; so it works!
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Once again Richard Castle has delivered a &#34;I'll fix dinner later&#34; read. Add a complicated romance to a very complicated murder and you have a must read.
B009LT1YZ6|1.0|Could not get into the game in order to enjoy it. It lacked a lot of user friendly aspects. No good!

B00004WX4X|4.0|One of the all time great hip hop albums.  Great sound on vinyl and a must have collectable for anyone that loves rap.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book took me a while to get into (maybe a chapter or 2) but once you get rolling, it's almost impossible to put down.
B000002WPH|4.0|One of the first rap albums I ever purchased when i was a kid.  The sound on vinyl is amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game.  I can't put it down, keep trying to complete the different levels.  I would recommend this game.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|It looked nice and hopefully will protect the screen of my Kindle if it ever falls it again.  Hadn't had the Kindle for a month and it got knocked off the counter and landed, of course, face down shattering the screen.  I was nearly in tears but luckily Hubby had bought the wonderful plan that replaced it for me.<br />This case for it, though, got scratched down to white stuff just being in my handbag for a few hours and I don't carry nails, darts or knives in it.
B000SEIKIW|5.0|Even though it has some technical details, the writers really make it easy for everyone to understand the basic principles of what we know so far about the universe.<br />What i really like about the book is the way that it shows how science has tried to explain the world around us from a very early stage in human history.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you love facebook you might as well have this for your kindle. Love this app! Everything on it is accurate.
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|Patric Stewart always delivers excellent acting.  And of course, there is the usual Star Trek humor.  Great movie.  Watch and enjoy.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Excellent read for women and her research was impressive regarding all content.  I've been out of business for while and found her approach refreshing.  Will be good for business mangers both male and female.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Love the Tarrantino amusing bloody motif, with excellent music picks to add to the flair.  Fun movie, excellent especially if you like earlier films by him.  Will change future westerns.  Both Foxx and the other bounty hunter's acting phenomenal.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is a truly open view into the human condition, the meaning of unconditional love , and forgiveness. A journey where you find parts of you own life and experiences within these pages.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This was an easy, fun read in which an unemployed techie gets a job at a secondhand bookstore, meets a beautiful girl who works for Google and together with his (wealthy) best friend and other companions they meet along the way they discover and solve a centuries old mystery sought and guarded by a secret society. It reads a little like a Dungeons and Dragons game, but is smart and funny. It was well written, which is a plus. It's not the Da Vinci Code, but it's similar in plot. Nobody dies though, and that's a plus.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|This one of the best apps yet.. the only problem, try getting it away from my 2 1\2 yr old son. The education,graphics, and incredibly adorable Dr.Panda are worth every penny!!  I have  Dr.Panda restraunt, hospital and beauty salon also.. they're all great.. these apps teach the little ones life lessons while there having fun... my son and I both love dr.panda!!
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Gift for husband and he keeps watching it over and over.  Arrived on time and my husband loves this classic.  Would highly recommend this to any old movie buffs.  Great for your classic collection.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Atria Books and Netgalley.)<br />17-year-old Sky has had a bit of a sheltered upbringing, living with her mom who hates technology - no internet, no phones, no tv. She's also home-schooled, and her only true friend is the girl who lives next door - Six.<br /><br />This year Six will be off an a foreign exchange program though, and Sky will be attending school for the first time ever.<br /><br />Before school starts though, Sky meets Holder, a boy who is rumored to have been in a juvenile detention center for a year, and the only boy who has ever made Sky really feel anything.<br /><br />Holder is hiding something from Sky though, something that it seems Sky might even be hiding from herself. Either way, Sky is about to find out that her life is not exactly what she thought it was, and will never be the same again.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, the mystery of what was really going on kept me hooked!<br /><br />Sky was a normal 17 year old girl, apart from the fact that she no clue when it came to anything technological. She had no idea what facebook was, or what 'lol' stood for, and although she had some experience with boys, she had never actually felt anything for anyone. She didn't mind the occasional make-out session, but nobody ever made her heart pound, or made her want to kiss them.<br /><br />Holder was an interesting character, and I liked the ideas behind his tattoo! I thought that he was really a bit of a tease to poor sky, especially with his 'firsts' conversation (he didn't want to kiss her, because that would be one 'first' out of the way for their relationship, and therefore their relationship would be closer to its end!). This whole 'firsts' thing was a little irritating to be honest, especially considering that a kiss counted as a 'first', but funnily enough, an orgasm didn't!<br /><br />I liked the storyline in this book, although I think it was the mystery element that kept me reading the most. I was really intrigued as to what Holder's issues were, and what the hell was really going on with Sky. This was one of those books that you really don't want to put down because you just want to know what happens next!<br /><br />I did like the ending of this story, even though part of it was a little difficult to believe in my opinion. I also liked the story that Sky's mom told her at the end, although I can't tell you what that is!<br /><br />Overall; I liked this book, even though Holder was a bit of a tease at times. I was kept hooked by the mystery element of the story, and I liked how the book came together at the end.<br />7.5 out of 10.
0062020897|5.0|I bought this book because I kept noticing that this was what Meryl Streep was reading during the movie Iron Lady - I thought I'd give it a try because of that and I'm glad I did.

B001EBULU8|5.0|All I can say is that, this is one of my most Favorite Movies!!  I listen and watch this movie all the time.!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I enjoy reading all of Michael Connelly books.  This was a great mystery.  I would recommend this book to every mystery reader.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Uplifting and funny, surprising given the topic.  Great acting.  Reminder to get out there and make the most of your life every day.
B008N1V11U|4.0|This is a great game, but it is hard to play on a tablet or in this case a Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;. The game tends to lag in parts and the fighting is awkward as the icons pop up randomly instead of being static. By that I mean until you need say &#34;punch&#34; that part of the screen is blank so it makes it hard to memorize the layout, so I end up tapping the same spots hoping it works out. But that is more a comment on tablet games than about this game specifically. It's still a fun game. Requires a bit of patience though
0307878937|2.0|it was seriously flawed in terms of what make sense in the context of character.  If the author were to justify some of the plot twists and turns, she would have needed double the space and twice the talent
B008C0C1Y8|5.0|despite the evolution of special effects, for some reason the remake failed to capture the heart of the movie. Judge Dredd is about the law, Stallone gets that point across. Behind that icy stare lies a heart of Gold and Stallone shows that as well. The special effects may seem a bit cheesy at some points but overall they stand up to the test of time. A few critics said that Stallone's performance was a bit over the top, to which I can only say that this is a comic book based movie. there is no real way to bring this character to the big screen without being over the top. though I must say that I think his performance when taken in context is quite memorable and stands out. Just like in Rocky, his body language says as much about the character as by what he says. This is a fun movie. lots of action and sci-fi touches. I guess you can call it a sleeper-classic as most people I know remember this movie quite fondly. It's a great looking movie, and looks even better on blu ray.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I Loved the writing. How the story flows and unfolds. Enjoyed the characters and how they evolve. Truly her best work
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|until I saw this movie, the only peter pan related movie I actually liked was Hook (still a classic in the grandest sense). The previous incarnations were decent, but nothing spectacular (except Hook) I didn't really like the animated Disney film. I find that when Disney adapts classic stories/fairy tales they tend to over-disneyfy them. And there is generally a lot lost in the translation. I didn't really expect much from this film when I first watched it, I had borrowed a friend's dvd so i'd have something to watch. I actually was quite impressed (so much I purchased this on dvd at one point then on blu ray more recently). I have only recently read the original story (in it's original form) and found that this version is probably the truest or purest telling of the original story. Remember, Hook was more an update on Pan's life, but it also made reference to parts of the original story, which I didn't know at the time, due to the many adaptations of the story that I have read over the years. This movie though is the same story from the book, and the magic of the story is front and center, the actors are well chosen (though for child actors they do a great job at capturing the very essence of the original story) the screenplay serves the movie well and the special effects are top-notch. Though it's really the story that's the star here. This is a definite must have for anyone who like, peter pan, never really grew up...and can appreciate the magic of one of the greatest fairy tales ever created.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|First off, I loved the movie!! The package arrived on time and the product was neatly packaged. I would definitely recommend this movie and the buyer.
B00005NKKV|5.0|it may sound cliché but this is a classic, Paul Simon is an excellent songwriter (and vocalist) and many times his songs are great to read as poems as well. even if you've never heard these songs and just read the lyrics as if they were poems you would be extremely impressed. Luckily for Simon and Garfunkel they also sound great when sung. They harmonize really well and both have flawless vocals. A definite must have for any music collection.
B003L20ICO|4.0|This is a pretty good movie. I love Mark Ruffalo so I might be biased. Haha The package arrived on time and the product was neatly packaged. I would definitely recommend this movie and the buyer.
B008IZYWXU|5.0|anyone who is a fan of Queen and of course Freddie Mercury knows (from his songwriting) that  he is a fan of the theatrical, the dramatic and of course the operatic. HIs vocals are near-flawless and it's hard to listen to him and not be enraptured by the power of his voice. It may sound as if I am overselling him, but anyone who has heard him and were fans of either Queen or his solo work knows there is no way to actually do that. So take his considerable talents (both vocals and songwriting) and pair him up with one of Opera's premier divas Montserrat Caballe, and you have an undeniable masterpiece. Perhaps overlooked in his lifetime due to his rock roots, this is a great operatic performance. Freddie had a way of reaching out and pulling you in with his vocals and live he could make you believe that he was singing directly to you, though you were one among thousands. The live orchestra that is used on this set is a great addition, while some purists may balk. I'd think Freddie would approve. The quality of this album is still the main attraction the vocals sound more vibrant than ever. There was a lot of love shown for this album by those involved in the reissue, and it shines through.<br /><br />The first cd is the album with the new orchestra taking the place of the synthesized stuff (from the original album) and the effect isn't as noticeable as you might think. That isn't to say the performance is lacking in any way.The orchestra sounds great. I am simply saying that it does not distract you in anyway and sounds natural so if you are a fan of the original you won't feel as if a great injustice was done.<br /><br />The Second cd is great to listen to, and is more for completists than for casual listeners. Most notable though is that there are a few demo versions which include either alternate/original lyrics or simply Freddie-only vocals, which is a treat, don't get me wrong but it is something most music enthusiasts wouldn't really miss unless they are (like me) someone who loves to hear the process it took (in a semi-step-by-step sort of way) how the album evolved. But, I am sure those who are reading this are looking forward to this disc most of all, as we are all wanting the best version we can find of anything Freddie related.<br /><br />The third disc (though technically this should be the fourth) is the dvd, and it looks great. Not sure why collector sets aren't including blu rays by now, I assume cause of cost, is beyond me. The sound of the dvd is on par with the rest of the collection and the official video has been re-synched using the orchestral backing instead of synths. So it all has a unifying sound (and again it makes it sound more natural and you don't feel like you are being short changed). The live performances look great too especially due to it's age, and as is usually the case with older video there seems to be a slight aura around the performers (due to lighting and how it shows up on tape) though it's not a negative thing as it's as good as it's ever going to be, It seemed to add a bit of an ethereal quality And anyone who is watching this dvd will consider it bittersweet considering it was one of his last performances. overall it is a great addition to any music-related collection as it's definitely a profound moment in time and the meeting of two vocal giants, and should be viewed at least once by anyone who is a fan of real music. The extras are nice but if I had one complaint it would be that it focused too much on the making of the orchestral version rather than the making of the original album. This should have been more Freddie-centric in my opinion. Though anyone who has the Great Pretender blu ray or dvd will recognize part of the interviews from this dvd. But, here it seems more in context and more organic. The Great Pretender dvd, though worth owning, tended to showcase soundbites rather than keep things in context, which left the viewer with a much different impression of Freddie thanthey should have. So if you watch that one, hopefully you know enough about Freddie so you can keep things in better perspective.<br /><br />The final cd, though nice to have, is a bit of an oddity, as it's the orchestral part of the album sans vocals. Which I guess is nice to have, but as someone pointed out this would be great for anyone into Karaoke but who in the world can match vocals with these two? As it is part of the overall collection, in that context I say it's nice they included it, but what would have been better in my opinion is if they included the ORIGINAL album with synths, and then maybe just the orchestra backings. all would have fit nicely on one cd. that way purists would not have anything to complain about (just like star wars fans always complain that the theatrical versions of IV-VI were not included with the blu rays)  my thoughts on this is that the first cd should have been the original, the second should have been the new orchestral versions, the third should have been the demos/rarities as well as just the orchestral backing...and of course include the dvd, which is worth the price of this set by itself.  Casual fans will probably be satisfied with the reissued version of the original (usually found for a fair price on amazon) but anyone who loves Freddie's music will find this is something they shouldn't be without. Even such a great operatic voice like Caballe seemed in awe of Freddie's vocals. Just watch them perform together and you'll see. While there was a lot of love put into this collection there was an equal amount of love from her as well. they had great chemistry. and for rock critics who blew this off as a one-off or a bad experiment or Freddie being over-indulgent all I can say is why do people who hate music try and write about something they know nothing about? While the fact that this is opera may have scared people away in the past, it seems like today's audience is much more in-the-know about what Freddie was all aboutso they know that vocally he is virtually unrivaled so even people who are not opera fans will find themselves blown away. by this performance, and on top of that add Montserrat Caballe's vocals and you have a rock n' roll masterpiece. One that everyone should experience at least once....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's just overall a great interesting fun read<br />It's entertaining and has everything for a child or a adult read it
B009WO7NQO|5.0|so shouldn't the angry birds technically be Sith? If you are a fan of Angry Birds Space you will like this as well. Of course the addition of the star wars influenced versions of the well known birds (with obvious anger management issues) will be sure to delight. Not a bad idea to have for children, as all children love star wars and angry birds tends to capture our attention whether that's a good thing or not.
B009JZORSI|4.0|This movie gets the non-star trek person to like Star Trek! If you haven't seen it make sure you rent it.
B002V9PEUE|5.0|Stallone, while considered a highly bankable action star (even into his 60s) is also a great writer (and in many respects very underrated...just look at Rocky or even Rocky Balboa) The action is suspenseful and at times intense. The dizzying heights only adds to the intensity. Add to that the impeccable performances by John Lithgow and of course Stallone, and you have one great movie. While not as in-your-face as say a Rambo movie or the Expendables, the action is well paced and believable. The story sets up everything rather nicely, and well John Lithgow, whether he is doing comedy or drama or in this case, playing someone you love to hate, is hard not to love. No one does over the top like John Lithgow. He just has a way of grabbing your attention and keeping it. With Stallone's star power it's hard to imagine anyone who  can steal a scene from him, but Lithgow is a worthy adversary and of course an exciting actor to watch. Some of the story seems a bit by-the-numbers compared to today's movies, but then again a lot of movies have been inspired by Stallone-written action pieces...so it's easy to over the look. But it's an easy Classic nonetheless
140053271X|4.0|I did enjoy it for a while but the limitations were to great.  It did as it was supposed to and still worked ( after a little calibrating ) after working its way out from under the bungee on my motorcycle and doing a couple of end over ends. Finally I bought an E Book and gave the nook to my grandson. My daughter says he loves it
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I find the app useful when I am out eating. When I am work I walk across the street to eat, and while I am sitting there it's much easier to read flipboard than say a magazine/newspaper (though I still prefer tangible items to the internet/blogs/mobile info) the articles are pretty up to date and though they tend to be redundant (you might have the same articles under &#34;flip board picks&#34; as you do under &#34;news&#34; or &#34;technology&#34; )but there is enough to keep you busy. My only issue in getting my news this way (as I have this issue with anything online) is that articles tend to be more like blogs than actual news articles. Grammatically speaking, there are many mistakes and sometimes you'll find typos or maybe it's simply just poor communication skills. But as long as you use this for updates or general information, you should be fine.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|keeps getting more interesting as the season unfold.  Hope they get many more.  The mix of classes and politics keeps it moving forward.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|Pink is quite different than her peers (or those who started their careers about the same time, such as Britney Spears). Her voice is strong and her musical instincts are quite honed. Not only is she strong as a songwriter but also as a performer. Unlike her peers who rely heavily on lip synching in favor of spectacle, Pink delivers both. While not over the top or excessive (to the point of being irritating as some people are) her performance is fun to watch, but listening to her live is where the truth of her talent lies. Anyone can sound great in the studio (and Pink has always sounded great in the studio, using the tools to accentuate (not to fix) her vocals). She's just as great to listen to live. And that's how you can tell when you have a real vocalist and not just a studio fabricated product. Very few artists from when she started to present day even deliver on the &#34;live&#34; promise. Most lip synch (even older artists like Madonna rely too heavily on it.) If I want to hear someone lip synch I'll stay at home and just listen to the cd. or watch the videos but why bother watching someone live if they are not really &#34;performing&#34;? Madonna relies so much on lip synching in order to facilitate her dance numbers that it's more like watching a dance troupe (with Madonna's music as a backdrop) than actually watching a live show. if you try to excuse it by saying that it's because of her on-stage performance that limits her vocally then check out any live show of Prince  or Queen and you will see that both can be done simultaneously. However, I do not want this to be a diatribe on how some artists fail their audience as much as I am trying to testify to Pink's genuine strengths.<br /><br />As she says on one of her new songs (not included in this show) &#34;there's nothing fake on me&#34; and well there is nothing fake here. I had never seen her live. and unfortunately I do not live in Australia so I missed this performance. But this blu ray more than adequately makes up for it. The songs are delivered strongly and the performances are fun and shows a bit of athleticism at some parts. Pink tends to think of herself as unglamorous, but she sells herself short. She is quite attractive, and how she bears her soul on some of the songs makes her more appealing, as you tend to find the emotions genuine and raw.<br /><br />Her delivery on the cover versions of &#34;Bohemian Rhapsody&#34; by Queen, and Gnarls Barkley's &#34;Crazy&#34; were awesome as well. Anyone who has seen Queen live or have seen the dvds/blu rays know this is a hard track to do live...and generally most who do queen covers generally come up short. But in their defense Freddie is a hard act to copy, but Pink appears as if she has lived through the angst that's depicted in the song (anyone who has ever used music as an escape from a mood they are in will know what I mean...I used to listen to this song whenever I got depressed as the song has a strangely dramatic melancholy followed by the existential &#34;nothing really matters to me&#34; line that can both let you embrace your depression and be lifted out of it at the same time) Pink definitely nails this song, and her rendition of Crazy brought my attention back to that song, I had forgotten about it, but her delivery brought the lyrics to life and made me realize just why that's such a great song).<br /><br />So the bottom line is, if you love Rock Music, Pink or empowered women who sing honestly and openly then you owe it to yourself to watch this. It is simply a great live show that you must see to believe. In this day of computer generated radio hits it's refreshing to both hear and to see such a great musical performance. it gives you hope for the future of music.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|The only thing wrong with this book is that it wasn't long enough! I've seen Tina Fey on SNL since she first read the news and bantred with Jimmy Fallon, and learned from my brother that she was also a writer. Added all together, she is responsible for several months of solid laughter (day and night) and this book increased that amount by almost 2 hours.<br />What can I say? I'm a fast reader!<br />I learned the cause of Tina's scar, and the reasons she can laugh at life. She admitted to having some of the same problems I've had. We may not have chosen to solve them the same way, but I couldn't enjoy reading about her way and her life any more than I did this afternoon.<br />The thing Tina has to remember is that she's still a young woman, regardless of a few of the pictures she paints of herself. Since the average lifespan for women is past 70, she has another 30 years or so to live.  (I'm going by Tina's age at the time the book was written.)<br />If your first book is this much fun. Tina, you have to keep writing for us. Please....
B00432QAKK|5.0|but I love the show and well the pricing makes the packaging bearable. The box comes with two plastic spindles which hold the dvds, so six seasons share one season and five the other spindle. while this is a great space saver. I do not understand why the spindles are so cheap why not make the tray/spindle a hard plastic? and the slip cover is ok, but not as sturdy as it should be.<br /><br />now onto the show itself. I lost track of the series during the last few seasons. I did not realize it was on for 11 seasons. and even though fox was screwing around with the schedule I had seen more of these episodes than I thought I did. But watching them straight through and seeing the evolution of the characters worked out great. there are a few featurettes that have interviews with the cast as well as easter eggs that have additional unaired clips from a reunion special. and there is an episode from the third season that wasn't aired (or so it says, but I swear I've seen it before...and in hindsight I wonder why it wasn't shown originally as they had done far more controversial episodes throughout their run.<br /><br />One thing I did notice (which is the beauty of watching a show season by season...as you can see things you missed when they first aired) is that the show never really jumped the shark, as it pretty much was an over the top production to begin with. the show seemed to relish in its absurdities. There were times when a character fell off the roof and it was obvious it was a dummy, and someone would say, ok we can see that's not a real person, well those people didn't get the joke. the writers invited us into their twisted little world. and they let us in on the jokes, so in some ways the show was a satire of all other family based sitcoms, and on the other hand it was a very unique take on the family sitcom.  The cast was perfect, the writing was spot-on and no matter how absurd it got, you couldn't help but laugh. It never took itself too seriously and it never tried to be something it wasn't. this was blue collar tv, before Rosanne (though many give that show credit for being the one that started the trend, even though Married with Children did it first....and best).<br /><br />Perhaps fueled by the controversy that surrounded it, the show became rather iconic even if it never was a number one show (fox was just starting out after all). But, I had never heard of a show that had such strong word of mouth and was as identifiable without being a Nielsen powerhouse. Well, not until this show turned up, same as with The Simpsons, everyone knew of the Simpsons and the catchphrases without it being  a number one show either. My favorite part is how when the show started you find Bud playing a believable son to fictional Al (who was a bit of a caricature unto himself, perhaps a character no one else could have played but Ed O'neil) and you kind of saw him as a &#34;bundy&#34; and you saw Kelly as what Al could never be (popular, loved and happy) so when the show progressed and it was Kelly who became more like Al, you kind of find it more believable when Al says what his life could have been. The young and beautiful Kelly seemed to have a promising life ahead of her, but in the end you find that life can shatter even the most promising of dreams. She was more like Al than you would have thought. He was popular in high school too. now...he's married with Children.<br /><br />Katy Segal plays Peggy perfectly. You can see why Al can both love her and be frustrated with her at the same time. Though you really can't understand why he wouldn't want to go to bed with her. as she is a beautiful woman, perhaps too extreme at times. There were times when the writers made her rather unlikable. I guess it helped the story along, but at the same time it made you wonder why Al would have put up with her for so long.<br /><br />though the details can be rather inconsistent, I don't think it matters, or that they care. Obviously they could not have done anything they did or have what they had if he really didn't make any money as a shoe salesman, and at times the over-exaggeration can be a bit trying, but they somehow managed to make you forget all of that with some great lines. Though I found Peggy wasn't given as many great lines as Al. maybe they needed more female writers I am not sure. But overall the show was great and highly rewatchable.<br /><br />One last thought, since this show got a lot of bad press about it's dysfunctionaltiy I would like to say that with this show, no matter how over the top they got, no matter how mean they would be to each other at times, when it really got down to it they loved each other. and they always had each other's back. While they might harass each other without a second thought no one else could. They had each other's back. that's something you don't really see in most family oriented shows, or they were more talk than action. In Married with Children you got the sense that even though they seemed like they hated each other when it came right down to it they actually cared about each other. You get the feeling too that the cast got along in real life as well, as the chemistry is strong, and though the supporting characters may seem to despise the bundys you feel as if the actors respected each other. and in the end, I believe that if a show is to be successful you not only need talented actors but you need them to have the right chemistry together. The actors all seem to respect and care for each other (you can see this more when you watch the featurettes) and that comes across In the show, and that's why it's not hard to like this rather strange but relatable family

B0074PNCRM|3.0|I have heard such raving reviews for John Green and this novel. This is the first book by him that I have read. I must say that I found it exceptionally average. Yes, it was full of witticisms, clever remarks, and various other tidbits that made me smile, but I just couldn't get past that fact that the narration was boyish. Perhaps that sounds sexist. Having watched Mr. Green's video blog, I could not separate his voice from Hazels. She did not have the voice of a sixteen year old girl, but more of a thirty-something-year old intellectual male. I also found the way Gus spoke to be highly unbelievable. Not that I don't think that teenagers can't be intellectuals.<br /><br />Much of talked about OTHER novels, music, movies, etc; things which I am not interested in.<br /><br />This novel is in the first person of Hazel Grace, a sixteen year old girl with cancer.<br />*spoilers*<br />Here's a watered down summary of The Fault in our Stars:<br /> Hazel meets Gus. They go to Amsterdam to meet some douchey author. They fall in love, Gus dies, Hazel is sad.<br />I was waiting for a twist, or some great storyline, but there wasn't even that. However, having finished the novel I feel as though I can't give it any less than three stars.<br />This book was not absolute rubbish, but it was forgettable. Nothing special.<br /><br />But all that aside, I really felt that not much happened in this novel.<br /><br />I feel that Mr. Green's writing talents would be better suited to a Romantic Comedy.

B000003TAW|5.0|Much like Smashing Pumpkins Zeitgeist, Weezer's blue album has 8 great songs. I like every one except Surf Wax America and Only in Dreams(but great bass line). I have Weezer's video capture device, but after watching and listening to that for awhile, I wanted to have the recorded versions of the blue album. On the video capture device, you see an early performance in a park of my name is jonas. The audio is not great on that performance and it's a great song among many, so I had to have the blue album. Recommended for everyone.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|this was a great vacation read. fast-paced and had me interested until the very last page.<br />great ending (although kind've sad), but relatable and relevant today.<br />i would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes &#34;who-done-it thrillers&#34;.

B0049VZ222|3.0|Well, after hearing all the &#34;rave&#34; reviews for this show I decided to give it a try.  AMC had a Walking Dead marathon a couple of months ago with all of Season 2 and Season 3 up to the most recent episode at that time.  I ordered Season 1 and enjoyed a few episodes despite how implausible and ludicrous the story line was.  Could the Walking Dead really take over almost the entire country/planet in a period of months???  Anyway, if you can suspend reality and enjoy the show for what it is...mindless, zombie slashing &#34;fun&#34; you will enjoy it.  Be prepared to increasingly have to suspend belief by the time you get to Seasons 2 and 3 though.  I think that episode 4 of Season 3 (&#34;A Killer Among Us&#34; -- I think the episode is called) is when the show &#34;jumps the shark&#34; in my opinion.
141690977X|5.0|I read this about 8 years ago.  I thought the title was intriguing and my daughter was pre-dating age, so I thought it would be good to know what it said.  Little did I know it would help me also.  Some people are the types that have a million friends because of their personalities. I wasn't that person, but would feel as if after a while, some of my friends were either too busy or just weren't holding up their part of the relationship.  For whatever reason, after I read this book, I felt I should have more respect for what I brought to the relationship.  It has changed my life.  I have many more friends now and they are better friends to me.  The reason for that is this book.<br /><br />I now recognize little signs I failed to see before.  I no longer am hurt by changes in a person's behavior, I just let it go. I realize that there are other people that will give me what I need.  I am more direct now.  It could just be my age, but this book does make you realize that the signs are there, you can't ignore them.<br /><br />My son's relationship just ended.  I could see it coming because of this book.  It made me sad and it made me particularly sad that he could not see it coming.  All the signs were there.  The girl all of a sudden had too much on her plate, couldn't fit him in on the weekend, didn't like to talk on the phone.  He just refused to see it.  It is very sad, but I am hoping he will read this book so during the next relationship, he can recognize if it happens and possibly correct it or move on.<br /><br />I would encourage you to add this to your library to share it with people who are having trouble with any kind of relationships, male, female, romantic or just regular friendships.
0440539811|5.0|Excellent and well-written conspiracy romp that ties together every other conspiracy story ever wondered about and brings it to life in an entertaining and funny way.  The George C. Scott movie:  The Formula  may have been inspired by a smal part of this.

B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|If you're interested in fantasy, especially as it takes the form of an endless struggle between good and evil, Roy Huff's Everville:  The First Pillar is a selection you won't regret.  Huff has a direct, uncomplicated prose style that provides the sort of clarity needed to prevent a complex tale from becoming unwieldy.  As I read Everville, I was both pleased and surprised to find that I could follow the introduction and ongoing use of a fairly large number of characters, times, places, events, and stunningly fascinating artifacts without becoming confused.  I recall only one instance when, after putting the book down for a while, upon resuming reading I had to page back a bit to recall the role played by a marginally important character.  Otherwise, Huff's reader-friendly account makes following the story and keeping track of its elements really quite easy.  A welcome change from many other novels of this kind.<br /><br />In addition, when Huff writes about good and evil, as I understand him, he does it with imagination and skill.  Even the most esoteric characters and entities have a conceptual believability that enhances the pleasure of reading Huff's work.  In good part, I think this comes from the author's ability to weave the components of his story into a coherent whole.  Given Everville's complexity, its use of realms and domains that differ with regard to place, time, dimension, inhabitants, and essence, this is quite an accomplishment.  To a judicious degree, this is done through purposeful redundancy, but the book never seems repetitious.<br /><br />Huff also knows how to make you care about the inhabitants of the pages of his novel.  The strangest characters have their own particular kind of charm and good intentions that enable the reader to respond to them as if they were treasured friends, valued neighbors, or close associates in whose company we are invariably happy and at our best.  Without giving away too much, I can't imagine anything better than living among the Frons as one of their kind.  Huff's decision to make the Frons not only winsome, but imperfect and capable of sustained, good-natured revelry, maybe even a bit of over-indulgence, was wise.  The thought of harm coming to anyone among them makes me wince.<br /><br />Huff is equally adept at portraying physical manifestations of evil, and explaining its source and enabling us to understand its power.  He is able to make the reader feel and dread evil in a way that is visceral and alarming, especially after he has imbued his readers with affection for the genuinely good, whom the evil would harm.<br /><br />I did not expect to like this book.  I anticipated something better suited to sixth graders than adults.  I'm happy to admit that my expectations were far off the mark, and I'm looking forward to enjoying the next volume in the Everville series.living among the Frons as one of their kind.

B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Like my heading says, this production is really just a spot check of the book. Not at all what my imagineerings created from the text - disappointed. Read the book, its better.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Over-hyped and really dull.  Sure, it had good acting and directing.  I've read biographies of Lincoln and several Civil War histories, so I had high hopes for this movie.  The dialogue is so banal as if the writer's were trying to compress the beliefs and positions of the people being portrayed into every line spoken in the movie.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|An amazing compilation and mixture of fresh, lovely music, sound, variety.<br /><br />The combination of a number of different styles of music is so incredibly attractive, and pleasurable to experience.
