B000005RQT|5.0|Deep purple was one of the first metal bands, they were laying down hard rock since 1968 and join blue cheer and ufo among others as the start of real metal bands. led zep is partially one too,  This one is their first that is totally a metal cd though. from start to finish the formula is perfected here and it's still around today.  The classic 'child in time' is on this one. At the time this was called acid rock but it wasn't the acid days had burnt out so many people that the scene was faded away. This one gives you alot of bonus tracks too. I love deep purple, they did go into funk rock later on before returning to rock but this is the band at it's pioneering best. There isn't a bad song on here and it's truly classic in playing and in Ian's singing. GET purple power in  your life with this one.  I didn't think the sound is bad either.

B002BWP49C|5.0|I have seen all the moveies and read all the books, and the anticipation of finally getting to see Breaking Dawn part 1 was overwhelming for a woman in her sixties. I was not disappointed and wished I was able to buy the DVD in the lobby. I have not been a person who would watch a movie more than once in the theater, but this one is the acception. I knew right where the division for part 2 would start because it followed the book so closely. I was surprised they had to tone down the birth for a PG13. It was such an important part of the book but was alright. I loved the wedding. I only have one negative comnment. Why so long to see PART 2?

My 4th grade son read the entire book the night I brought it home, and my 2nd grade daughter devoured it the next day. We all know these books sell themselves, so I don't need to convince you of their greatness. I'll just say that this one is every bit as fun as the five that came before it.

My 13 year old grand daughter loved it also.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As someone who has seen firsthand the horrors of war, I think that this book was right on point.  This book is about how war takes it's toll on everyone involved, and how difficult it is to recover once you've been in battle for a long time.  For me, Katniss continues to be a hero throughout this book, because she sees the inconsistencies and the contradictions that the others either can't or won't see.  She is forced to look at herself and everyone around her with brutal honesty.    The ending was evidently very disappointing to a lot of readers, but I felt that it fit the story.  There are no happy endings in Panem, not even with the falling of the Capitol.  The reality of Collins' world is that people survive, period.  They do not thrive, they do not live in a fairytale world, and there are no quick fixes or miracle cures for people who have been forced to watch their children kill each other for entertainment for 75 years.  The ending of this book breaks them free from the Capitol, but not from their reality.  If you can deal with that thought, then this book is a fitting end to an amazing trilogy.

1451627289|5.0|Stephen King never loses his touch to awe and suprise me. It has the quality of a good novel and just enough of the macabre to make it a book you cannot put down.
0307279189|5.0|This book so inspired me that I had to set it down and go running immediately several times while reading it.  I read it again a few months later, and it is the only book I've read twice in the last 20 years.  Sure, there are a lot of side stories, so make sure you read each chapter all the way before stopping or you can get lost.  But there is nothing to make someone slightly over the hill (meaning 35 or older) excited to get into running.  And I've totally adopted the barefoot running approach advocated in the book, and it has made all the difference.  Since reading this book the first time one year ago, I've run three marathons (two trail), even though I'd never run a marathon in my life until this year.  And the fight against crass commercialism to live as you should emerges as a key theme.  Stop reading my review and start reading this book, until you have to set it down and go running!

B000001FN1|5.0|I bought this because of the cover, when I was about 14 or 15, and what a great surprise to get a great Album.... I still pull it out and listen to it.
0345529057|3.0|I, like many probably, purchased this after getting interested in the show on HBO. I enjoyed the show and it is done amazingly well, but the book is far, far better. I can only imagine how they are going to fit all the action from A Clash of Kings into such a short number of episodes (Well, to be completely honest they could probably finish up a number of the stories in the book in an episode or two since for a number of characters little of substance actually happens).     Anyways, I am currently in the middle of A Storm of Swords and have started noticing a couple of things. Namely, there are quite a few spelling issues that crop up throughout the book (I can only remember one or two from the first two). I can't say if this is also in other editions or not, but it really takes me out of the story when it happens.     I've also found that a number of pages are off-kilter, having been printed at an angle or near the edge of the page with little more than a 1/16\\" right-side margin. I understand this edition is mainly a cheapo version, but this is somewhat much. The cardboard container the books come in isn't exactly sturdy and is mostly just used for keeping the books next to each other, although there isn't much point to it otherwise. I don't treat my books harshly, but simply reading the first two books has caused noticeable damage to the spine and cover. A not insignificant portion of the covers, especially around the edges, has worn away and the spine titles are pretty much gone.     If you're thinking about keeping these books for any period of time or plan on reading them more than once it would be in your best interest to invest in a different edition. For the price, this is absolutely a must-buy if you're looking for cheap entry into the series like I was. If you're already a fan and want a set of books to keep, look elsewhere.
B004132HZS|5.0|The problem in other Sherlock Holmes productions is that Dr. Watson and Inspector Lestrade are fools.  Being able to out-think bumblers doesn't make Holmes great, it makes him at least average.  In this series, I like Dr. Watson's capabilities and that Inspector Lestrade is a top inspector.  What makes Holmes great is that he helps when the best-of-the-best are stumped and this series gets that.

B000002L9Y|5.0|First let me say, when Fleetwood Mac (1975), Rumours (1977), and Tusk (1979) were remastered and reissued with bonus material in 2004, I had hope that Mirage (1982) and Tango In The Night (1987) would get the same treatment.  While Mirage is only really memorable for a couple of tracks - \\"Gypsy\\" and \\"Hold Me\\" - Tango In the Night delivers from start to finish.  The strongest player on the record is obviously Lindsey Buckingham, simply because of his hand in production and standout cuts like the debut single, \\"Big Love,\\" as well as \\"Caroline\\" and \\"Tango In the Night.\\"  I didn't care much for \\"Family Man,\\" but I don't skip it when I play the album.  Christine McVie really turns out the hits on this album - as she usually did; she had a greater knack for writing hits than her songwriting counterparts within Fleetwood Mac - with \\"Little Lies,\\" \\"Everywhere,\\" and \\"Isn't It Midnight,\\" which was a hit in the U.K. and would have surely charted well in the U.S. had it been released as a single.  \\"Mystified\\" is a beautiful Christine ballad, reminiscent of \\"Songbird.\\"  The weakest contributor to Tango was Stevie Nicks.  I love Stevie and this really wasn't her fault.  She had just come off touring to support her third solo album, Rock A Little, and a stint at Betty Ford to deal with her cocaine addiction.  Stevie got fewer songs on the album than she probably would have had she been there the whole time, and while I love \\"Seven Wonders\\" and \\"Welcome To The Room... Sara,\\" \\"When I See You Again\\" just doesn't cut it.  Tango In The Night proves much better than Mirage (which is still a great album) that Fleetwood Mac could transition well from the 1970s to the 1980s.

0312330537|5.0|I rate this book in my top 5 with the following (in no particular order):  1.  Atlas Shrugged (Rand)  2.  The Unbearable Lightness of Being (Kundera)  3.  What is the What (Eggers)  4.  An Immoveable Feast (Hemingway)  5.  Shantaram  I picked up this book shortly after returning from Bombay, and was immediately captivated by the author's understanding of and experiences in such a rich and complex city.  From page one, the book is captivating - a fascinating story made even more colorful by beautifully written reflections and a healthy dose of wit and charm.  It's been awhile since a book has actually transported me to another person's life - from slum doctor to prisoner, through heroin addiction and back, criminal to war rebel... you are there for every moment.  But the story is only the beginning.  I underlined at least 50 different passages that I felt should be re-read and reflected upon.  Read this book!
B004LWZW4C|3.0|Up until now, I've mostly enjoyed the X-Men series of movies.  The \\"Origins: Wolverine\\" story line was ok, but nothing great, and unlike a lot of the reviewers here, I did enjoy X-Men 3 as a nice closure to the main team story arc (despite the death of Professor X and Cyclops in X3...hopefully that's not a spoiler to anyone who's reading this).  I would also agree that X-Men 2 was the best of the lot.  I followed the comic for a few years as a kid, so most of the heroes and villains were all known to me, quite a bit of the back story was familiar too, and for the most part I really enjoyed the transformation of the story and characters to screen.  And based on the previews, I had high hopes for this movie as well.    Unfortunately my expectations weren't met.  Apart from the excellent performance and convincing development of the Magneto character by Michael Fassbender (previously known from \\" Inglourious Basterds\\" among other pieces), a lot of the rest was just a little flat.  McAvoy does a decent job with his Professor-X-to-be role, but it seemed a bit off-target (a little TOO conceited and brash) from how it was developed for the X-Men series.  Kevin Bacon seems ok in the role as Sebastian Shaw, but as already pointed out in a review, he seems a bit out of place in his scenes...like he just walked on to the set after a quick coffee break and they started rolling before he got fully in character.  And January Jones, who I really liked in \\"Mad Men\\" either has a null presence or looks mostly annoyed that she's in the movie...maybe because she's walking around in her underwear half the movie (which would normally be a plus for me, but she wasn't able to make it work, so to say).  And unfortunately that seems to be my feel about a lot of the rest of actors/characters...good enough for a comic book movie but nothing phenomenal (Fassbender excluded...McAvoy to a lesser degree).  The special effects are good, the story line interesting enough, but the gaggle of little teener mutants (recruited by Xavier to fight the battle for good!) just added unnecessary clutter to the cast.  Even Jennifer Lawrence, who was awesome in \\"Winter's Bone\\" was just kind of \\"there\\" in the movie despite ample screen time.  The problem with long running comic books is after awhile, they start to resemble soap operas with a constant churning of plot line, character, drama, sex, violence, etc.  What made the first 2 X-Men movies special was more of a human story line, about people who just happened to have super powers (and wear tight outfits!) and solid acting to present that conflict.  This X-Men story has some of that with the Xavier/Magneto development but it strays from that focus more than I'd prefer.  SO, all-in-all I enjoyed the movie...just not near as much as I had hoped based on the previews (which primarily focused on Fassbender and McAvoy, the movie's strengths in my book).    Lastly a few non-sequiturs that  bugged me in a not-so-major way:    - Why does Xavier grow up in New York with a British accent and his little foster sister (Raven or Mystique) never develops one?  Or better pondered, why didn't he lose his?  - Why does Eric/Magneto have a slightly Irish accent in this, when in later years he has a full-blown Shakespearean accent (as Ian McKellen portrayed him)?  - Magneto isn't made of metal (or magnetic) and therefore trying to stop a moving submarine shouldn't pull him along behind it (like he has a magnetic pull towards it)  - And...uh...many others I won't dwell on for fear of appearing like more of a geek than I am
140053271X|5.0|Although I consider my self a technological person, I can still appreciate the simplicity, yet effectiveness of the Nook Simple Touch. It packs a nice sized touchscreen which works off e-ink allowing me to read without glare, even in the sun. It is really easy to use, and has a surprising adept touchscreen. My only complaint is the soft buttons on the side which allow for easy page turning. They are to hard to push. Besides that I think this is a very viable option in the competitive ebook reader market.

0439023513|4.0|I knew going in that MOCKINGJAY wasn't necessarily a happy-go-lucky ending to an action-packed and highly controversial series about teenagers killing each other. THE HUNGER GAMES and CATCHING FIRE were both equally bleak, and painted a world seemingly devoid of any sort of moral compass. Things ended badly in CATCHING FIRE and with some major twists. And now, Katniss Everdeen returns to face her biggest challenges yet. The question remains: will the forces against a young girl from District 12 make her stronger? Or will they break her completely?<br /><br />Suzanne Collins picks MOCKINGJAY up right where CATCHING FIRE left off -- with Katniss flying in a hovercraft to the mysterious District 13 -- a place where a revolt against the evil Capitol has been brewing for some time now. The new society is stark and organized, and offers much more to people like Katniss and her family, but the question keeps egging at the back of her mind: where exactly is her freedom? Sure, she has food to eat now. She has quarters assigned to her family in a hospital-like environment. But still -- there are those in authority even in 13 that would control her. That would seek to use her. And now she has to decide which path she will take: Revolt against everything, or join a revolution that merely views her as a pawn? With her friend Peeta captured in the Capitol, and a war looming on the horizon, death is only right around the next corner.<br /><br />I will say this up front: I highly dislike Collins' first chapters. They seem to take too much time setting things back up and often seem highly over-written. But once this book takes off in the second and third chapters, things just don't let up. Katniss is faced with one terrifying decision after the next, and as every bulwark in her life is torn down, she has to learn to rely on herself to make it. Her character evolution is very interesting. In THE HUNGER GAMES, she begins as an idealistic and brave girl who will save her sister's life. As she grows in CATCHING FIRE, she begins to seek independence, but comes to see everything requires dependence -- her dependence on others, on the Capitol, on the hope of a resistance, on Peeta. On Gale. But in MOCKINGJAY, those things are slowly stripped away, until all she has left is herself. With Peeta captured and Gale caught up in the resistance, Katniss doesn't know where her place is. And this book is her struggle to find that place.<br /><br />Collins, as always, shines in the action. I couldn't help turning pages faster and faster as Katniss and Gale enter wartime situations to battle the Capitol. The writing was charged with excitement, and with some of the plot twists right up to the very last few chapters, it really did leave me breathless. Panic overcame me many times as I wondered: Who is going to possibly survive any of this? I began to dread the ending, wondering if Collins would finish painting her depiction of society in a bleak way or not. While I refuse to spoil the end, I will say that I was satisfied with it. Collins does wrap things up in a beautiful way -- the perfect ending that she could have chosen for such a trilogy.<br /><br />Readers who enjoyed the actual Hunger Games in both books one and two, will probably come to MOCKINGJAY expecting more of the same. What is here is very different. The whole series had to change positions and switch over to this sort of a finale. Collins has been building her viewpoints on what war and an oppressed society does. In so many ways, the Capitol reflects Western Civilization -- a place that has everything and wastes everything, while the Districts mirrors places the West relies on for food and exports. It's a fascinating look at the way societies interact and work with each other, and it definitely is sobering to the reader to consider the possibilities of such a society in the real world.<br /><br />Dystopian fiction can't find a better series than THE HUNGER GAMES. It truly is an epic trilogy thatwill be around for ages to come. And while MOCKINGJAY slips a little with momentum, the end of Katniss Everdeen's story is one that must be read. For when the end comes, then -- a new beginning can truly start to grow.JAY slips a little with momentum, the end of Katniss Everdeen's story is one that must be read.

I am positive they have had many of the thoughts Enzo had. I can see them listening to us as if they know what we are saying.  I am sure when my best friend \\"Booper\\" who went with me everywhere, felt as Enzo when he couldn't get around very well.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee was an absolutely wonderful book.  Set in the 1930s, it is written from the point of view of a young girl, the daughter of defense lawyer Atticus Finch.  As his daughter, she is exposed to the case of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of beating and sexually assaulting a white girl.  Atticus is determined to defend this man, though it goes against everything that most of the people in their little town in Alabama believe.  To Kill a Mockingbird tells the story of this girl's upbringing in the small town, and the moral crisis that shook it to its very core.  The themes of this book - for there are more than one theme - are diverse and complex.  The easiest to find is the theme of growing up and understanding the `grown up' world.  As the children see the case unfold, and hear the verdict, they face the realities of the 1930s.  The deeper message, however, is told in part by the title - it is a sin to kill a mockingbird.  One character explained this perfectly when she said, \\"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy...that's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\"  Throughout the book, there are metaphorical mockingbirds, Tom Robinson being the most obvious.  These people have brought nothing but goodness to the world, yet are persecuted, or \\"killed\\" by the society they are trapped within.  To Kill a Mockingbird shows how it sometimes takes an innocent child to make the world see the crimson sins that stain its darkest parts.  This heart-touching book is filled with amusement, adventures, and - above all - a message of compassion and morality.
0671469436|4.0|Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl is a very intriguing book.  Anne got her diary for her 13th birthday. She wrote in it almost every day, or at least she tried to. She referred to it as \\"Kitty\\".  She kept it while in hiding during the holocaust. The last entry in the diary is dated 1st of August, 1944. Her diary entries entail some of the hardships that she faced while in hiding, but they also address some of the positive things that happened, as well.<br />The diary holds many messages and common themes throughout, such as not giving up, cherishing the small things, and living every day as the last. Anne had to live in a small attic with five other people. She knew that she had to be friendly with everyone in this tight place, and her diary addresses some of the arguments she had with everyone. She was growing into a young woman on top of everything else, and that made it even harder for Anne to get along with people, and she felt like nobody understood her. Although it was hard for Anne, she treasured the smaller things, such as her \\"showers\\", which she had to take in an office room, with only dirty water and a sponge.<br /> Anne's diary is very \\"real\\" and \\"raw\\". It provides a lot of insight into what it was really like during the time period in which Anne Frank lived, and people can learn as much from her diary as they could from a history book. It is a first-hand account of what really happened, and at some points in the diary, it was very easy to relate to, and feel what she felt. Although there were some interesting points made in her diary, Anne complains often, which distracts the reader from the events at hand.<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to get to know more about the holocaust, and how people reacted. I would recommend this to someone because it provides real insight into Anne's life. The audience for this book could be anyone, but younger readers (teens) may want to read it, because at the time she wrote it, she was fourteen. It would be easier for a teenager to relate to this book than for an adult.<br /> Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl is a very enjoyable book, but it would have been more engaging if there weren't so many personal moments. Personally, I did not like it whenever Anne said something that was of no importance, and although that is the reality of a diary, I looked forward to the interesting parts, because that is what really kept my attention.

1400069181|5.0|Here is the review I posted on my blog...usually about Walt Disney World stuff.  Thanks to this book I may be going in a new direction.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So I know I have taken some time off from my blog.  I understand this is a big no no if you are wanting to build a loyal following, but I felt stuck.  For several weeks I have been reading some very good books.  It started with Donald Miller's Blue Like Jazz.  Then I went to another Miller book, A Million Miles in a Thousand Years.  Both of those books moved me and I wouldn't say shook my faith but they had me questioning the way I was living out my faith.  Seemed to me like I was just paying lip service to a big part of Jesus' ministry.  Me and Jesus were fine but somehow I had forgotten the part about loving and serving others.<br /><br />The next book I picked up was Start Something That Matters by Blake Mycoskie, founder of TOMS shoes.  He tells an amazing story.  From such a tiny upstart company, with an unproven business model and concept, he began something remarkable.  The book would be worth it just to hear his story of TOMS, but the book also details so many good stories of entrepreneurs, starting companies, and giving back to society.  I think the book does a good job of achieving the author's goal of inspiring the reader to get involved and begin taking steps to create a better world.<br /><br />I don't know where all this will lead me but I think my attitude toward certain social and environmental issues has changed.  My wife and I have begun volunteering at an outreach program that helps underprivileged kids with homework and reading.  This next weekend we will help our church pack meals for Feed My Starving Children.  Please believe me when I say that I am not trying to pat myself on the back and make myself look like a saint.  I just feel like it's time to begin taking my focus off of me and begin looking at a world that needs shoes, love, food, fathers, generosity, mothers and Christ.  Iknow this is pretty deep for a Disney World blog but it's my new voice.<br /><br />At one point in Blake's book he asks the question, \\"If you didn't have to worry about money, what would you do with your time?  What kind of work would you do? What causes would you serve?\\"  So the first two were easy for me to answer...I would go to Walt Disney World and I would work for WDW.  The third one was more difficult.  So my new goal is to try to figure out how to combine my love of the World with my new found compassion for the world.  When I discover that...watch out!!<br /><br />I did receive a free copy of the book through their Books for Bloggers program.  I am now trying to figure out how to run a contest to give away the other free Start Something That Matters book I received.  I really think it is a good, fast read that may change your heart and direction.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game runs great on Kindle Fire and is easy to to get into. I don't want to commit to the World of Warcraft lifestyle so this is a decent light replacement. I noted that subscriptions and logins carry over from other platforms (I have this on iOS as well) but characters do not. There aren't many people playing yet, so sign up and give this a try.<br /><br />Update: there are a lot of complaints about not being able to download the update. I didn't have a problem updating, everything works fine for me.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|Very good movie. My husband loves this movie so I bought it for him & he made me watch it. I ended up liking it.
B003L77GH4|5.0|The show's great, price was fantastic (got it on sale), it arrived on time, and in great shape. Usually I'm hesitate to buy DVD's through the internet because they arrive damaged and don't look half as great on my shelf, but that was not the case with amazon.
B004NSULHM|5.0|Simply... a wonderful album.. more complex and intimate than \\"In rainbows\\", I think. I'm already dreaming the 1st of july when I'll be there, in Florence, to listen their magic sounds. And I'm really happier 'cause I'll have time enough to get deeper into this album. I agree with you, guys, \\"The king of limbs\\" is not like taking a header, as \\"In rainbows\\" or \\"Hail to the thief\\" could be. Perhaps I'll edit again this review during theese months, because it's a pleasure for me to notice that Radiohead will never end to surprise us, not with fireworks, but caressing our hears with intimate and complex electronic and both acoustic sounds, that each time could lead you in a different dreamy panorama. Thank you very much, Radiohead. With all my heart, see you soon.

B004TI5N38|2.0|I have enjoyed many Baldacci novels and was excited when I read that he was starting a new series with a \\"Mitch Rapp\\" type hero. I pre ordered the book which means I paid too much whether it was good or not. I must say that I expected more from David Baldacci. I found the pace to be rather slow and plodding. The plot seemed to disconnect and wander and the events aren't really believable. I'm okay with \\"way out there, kick ass heros\\" in the vein of Indiana Jones, I just think you need to go all the way one way or the other. You can't be performing super human feats one minute and doing pain staking, detailed research the next. In my humble opinion a novel should either be believable or a departure (escape) from reality.
1932735410|4.0|For exam prep, this book in invaluable. It teaches you what PMI is looking for, in both their theory and in the exam. I understand that, and for that purpose, it has it's value. However, for real world application and training for junior, assistant, or rising PMs within a PMO environment, I would highly discourage it's use. I have worked in high level Project Mgmt for over 10 years including the training of several PMs, and numerous sections and questions in practice tests lead the reader to believe what a correct choice of action should be for certain situations, that if practiced in the real world, would get someone into serious trouble. To get through the exam - great resource. To teach the way the world really works - not so great.
B002XMGGK6|1.0|Had it not been for the 4-star consensus rating of this dreadful film, I most certainly would have passed on reviewing it, but I felt some combination of sanity and clarity had to be brought to light regarding \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" and what an absolute train wreck of a film it was. With a script that's implausible beyond comprehension, substandard acting beyond the likes of anything I've ever seen, and a director hellbent on giving a mainstream dumbed down American audience what they love, i.e. lots of stuff that blows up, this film cracks my personal top 25 in worst films ever made.  Most disappointing of all is Gerard Butler, who proves to be a 3rd rate hack of an actor and should never be offered a role by any serious filmmakers. His attempt at an American accent was atrocious and is only rivaled by Lloyd Bridge's horrendous attempt to pull off an Irish accent in \\"Blown Away\\".  Quick someone hand me a film, any film, I don't care if it's Madonna's \\"Swept Away\\" or Affleck/Lopez' \\"Gigli\\", I need something, anything, to erase the memory of wasting approximately two hours on \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\"!

B0067QPVJ6|5.0|i loved this movie, they did a great job at recreating the norwegian camp that you see in the classic 82 film. im a huge fan of the original, so i know what i'm talking about. and one of my favorite thing's about it is now i have a story for the axe on the door. if your a fan you know what i mean. i had wondered since i heard they were making a prequel is how they would bring that off and everything else. and they did a great job. i love the Classic, but i think i may like this better. the story is good and winstead played her part perfectly. i like how they have the new test that Kate come's up with, the whole cast did great, i realy liked the end,(spoiler alert) it was a lot like the classic basicly. Kate is by herself and staring into space with the sorm going on outside of the snow plow. like the original, you can't help but wonder what exactly, happened to her. it give's you the same feeling as the original, i loved this movie so much i saw it four time's in the theatre, and a part that i realy liked that they put in is when Lar's see's the dog run from the camp, and make's the helicopter pilot go after it and they blend in the end with the beggining of the classic. nicely done!

B006ANJ4BW|4.0|Critics hated this movie and a lot of people have said it sucked or was only kinda so so, but I disagree.  Is it the most amazing movie I have ever seen?  Not by a long shot, BUT...I did really enjoy it.  It's worth giving a watch if you're into these kinda movies.  Not for the kids...lots of gore and nudity, but it will definitely sooth the action/adventure/epic lover.  You can listen to some of the negative reviews if you want and skip it, but I recommend at least renting or Netflixing it and give it a watch and judge for yourself.  I liked it!
B0000A5BT1|1.0|I can't tell you how the movie was, I couldn't see it.  I have a DVD player compatable with Region 2, and IT DOES NOT PLAY.  I attmepted to return it with way too many e-mails to NO SATISFACTION.  They do not give refunds.  They wanted me to pay to ship it back to them, and then my only option was for a replacement.  Since it took so much time to try to work this out, I'm left with a piece of crap DVD.  No way I'd accept a replacement from this company.  They pass off junk!
0307913147|5.0|Where to begin?<br /><br />[2aaa] Well... I think I will start with Narrator Will Wheaton.  How do you know that name?  Will starred in the 80's film Stand By Me,  on Star Trek he was the Romulan voice.  And even more fun, Will is actually mentioned within this book/audio.  Will... has the perfect voice for the audio and I knew within the first minute I was in for something special.  Will even does Max Headroom's voice (as seen above) and that is no easy feat!<br /><br />Of course, while a great narrator on audio is important... it does not make the book complete if the book is not also amazing.  No worries... I am sue you can already tell b this early gushing that it is.... FANTASTIC.<br /><br />Being a die hard 80's chick I absolutely adored the constant 80's references to great movies such as Back To The Future, War Games, Real Genious, Better Off Dead, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Monty Python... and that's not even mentioning the great arcade references:  Miss Pacman, Joust, Burger Time...<br /><br />and the beauty of the combination in the Oasis was the mixture of the two... you could watch the 80's movies and play the games in the Oasis.  In fact as our protagonist says, many of the movies he has watched hundreds of times.  (And you will learn - thank goodness for that!)<br /><br />I think what really sucked me into this read *80's flashbacks aside) is that the story is good.... real good... It also is a little scary as I thought about Social media today and how fast it has grown in my lifetime, and found Ernest Cline's stony not unbelievable.  I can imagine a time when the world may be such a mess that people would rather stick themselves into an alternate reality (shoot its already happening!) then deal with the emotional drain of reality.<br /><br />Dont worry - the story never bogs down with doomsday like themes.  In fact I am quite sure two things will happen here:  1.  I will at some point listen to this audio again and 2.  I will own the book to add to my favorites collection.<br /><br />I also never found being inside the game world boring... instead, I was fascinated... it was as real feeling to me as my own life.  I also enjoyed being reminded of movies I once loved and insight to games I had once played (like a glitch in Miss Pacman arcade where you can hide for up to 15 minutes without being attacked)<br /><br />Treat yourself with this one soon... you will not be sorry.  While I have heard the book is just as incredible, I am going to recommend if you listen to audio - this is the way to go.he game world boring... instead, I was fascinated... it was as real feeling to me as my own life.

B00000IUT7|5.0|this is exactly what my son (husband) wanted!  read the reviews before purchasing about it not being able to get up the hills. we have quite a few hills and bridges on our Brio track set.  it is definitely easier for the engine to get up some than others, depends if it has space to gather some momentum - if it comes around a curve then has to go up a hill, it will usually slide back, but the engine will keep trying till it gets up.  it will straighten itself out (we have about 3 rings of track interconnected) and will eventually get up the hill.  same with pulling up other cars - if it doesn't make it on the first try it will keep on trying til it gets up.  they love watching it go around the various maze of tracks that they set up.  well worth it!

B001GM28HO|5.0|\\"The Fame\\". It is one of the best records I have listened to in quite a while, being 2 or more years. The first song, \\"Just Dance\\", is the introduction to her album and to the music industry as well. \\"Just Dance\\" was one of the best singles in 2008 along with her second single, \\"Poker Face\\" later on, approximately 2009. \\"Just Dance\\" was an overnight sensation to her career and is one of the most upbeat songs on the record along with \\"The Fame\\", \\"Poker Face\\", and \\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich.\\" The rest of her singles, \\"LoveGame\\", \\"Paparazzi\\", \\"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say), and \\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\\", are really good upbeat songs to dance to and also have a meaning, unlike other auto-tune pop artist in the music industry. The other songs that didn't make the cut to singles, like \\"BoysBoysBoys\\", \\"Money Honey\\", \\"Paper Gangsta\\", and \\"I Like It Rough\\" are my other favorites but my personal favorite is \\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\\" and \\"I Like It Rough\\". I suggest you buy the record on CD or vinyl because most of the photoshoot was great. And you can show off. ;) you really should buy it, because it is a great album. OR BUY THE INTERNATIONAL/IMPORT BECAUSE IT INCLUDES, \\"Retro, Dance, Freak\\", \\"Disco Heaven\\", AND \\"Again Again\\".
B005LZW8FO|5.0|I read a lot of reviews attempting to discredit this movie based on the scientific inaccuracies implicit in the movie.  While I cannot disagree with them, I don't think this movie ever billed itself as science fiction.  The movie doesn't spend any significant amount of time attempting to convince the viewer that this is possible.  The entire use of science/alternate universes in the movie is simply a plot device to examine more \\"philosophical\\" questions.  Indeed the entire concept of alternate universes is entirely theoretical.  However, using this plot device, the movie explores the fragility of our individual lives and the very unlikelihood of our exact existence (and by existence I do not mean in any evolutionary terms but rather the paths our lives take).  The very thought that a simple mistake combined with bad luck/chance at some point in our past or future could completely alter the entire path of our life is fascinating and humbling to me.  I'm not arguing that this movie is amazingly profound, but I think we all have had a moment where we have contemplated a mistake or decision we've made that has changed our lives and wishing we had a chance to change that moment and see where we would be now.    If you go into this movie expecting science fiction, you're bound to be disappointed and may miss the point of the film.  If you watch this movie as a meditation on how chance plays a significant role in our lives, I think you will get what the writers and director were attempting to accomplish.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, is both interesting and informative. As someone who was only somewhat familiar with Jobs' career, the biography opened my eyes to the recent thirty plus-year history of our cutting edge technology era. And as Isaacson correctly shows, Jobs was at the epicenter of this era, revolutionizing the world of personal computers, mobile devices, as well as the music, publishing and movie industries. Jobs and the company he personified, Apple, have created a range of products, including the Macintosh, iPod, iPhone and iPad that have literally changed the world.<br /><br />The book has so many fascinating stories, from the development of Apple's revolutionary products, to Jobs' rivalry with Microsoft's Bill Gates, to his \\"wilderness\\" years at the helm of Pixar that changed the face of movie animation. Isaacson also explores in depth what he describes as the \\"unified field theory\\", which drove both Jobs' business and personal life. Jobs obsessive pursuit of creating closed end-to-end integration of hardware and software put Apple as the polar opposite of companies, such as Microsoft and Google, who have aggressively pursued more open systems, widely licensed, that were compatible with a number of different products. Isaacson argues that while Apple's insistence on closed integrated systems, which were compatible with no other product, in the short-term reduced their market share in personal computers, it positioned the company perfectly in developing a \\"digital hub strategy', which has been highly successful and profitable today.<br /><br />This book, in which Jobs cooperated extensively with Isaacson, shows the Apple icon warts and all. Personally and professionally, Jobs was capable of legendary fits of anger, insensitivity, indifference and at times, cruelty. To Jobs, the world was \\"black and white' and \\"either/ or\\" and his quest for perfection left many causalities along the way, both in business and in his personal life. But the flip side of these flaws and Jobs' ability to focus with relentless intensity drove him furiously toward creating elegant, unique products that were simple to use and had the customer in mind. It also allowed Jobs to face adversity, ranging from his removal from the helm of Apple in the 1980's to his long battle with the cancer that eventually took his life.<br /><br />I would recommend this book highly, not only as an informative resource on business and technology, but as a fascinating view of how the creative process, when linked with technological advances, can literally change the way people live.<br /><br />Lance Ryskamp<br />President, LM Publications, LLCside of these flaws and Jobs' ability to focus with relentless intensity drove him furiously toward creating elegant, unique products that were simple to use and had the customer in mind.

B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe is one of those truly outstanding shows that combines intelligent scripts, high quality acting skills and such an imaginative premise, it is hard to see why its TV ratings struggle so. With rare exceptions there are almost no duff stories, which contrasts dramatically with most series which quickly become formulaic, covering exactly the same themes as every other drama on TV. I suspect this is because the studios turn things over to a team of payrolled writers who are brought on board by season 2 to churn out the same tired ideas (perhaps produced for them by some random generator software), undermining a shows originality.   Clearly, this has never happened with Fringe - the writing remains fresh; the plots innovative and  exciting, while the characters have depth and continue to evolve without ever losing the essence of who they are. I wonder if the trouble is that this the show is TOO imaginative and intelligent for a large percentage of the TV viewing public which seems to thrive on low quality, low budget programs presented by truly irritating halfwits.  Why so cynical? I think as one ages one imagines that education is making a difference and that this in turn might promote better quality programming, but with rare exceptions like Fringe, nothing has changed. If you want something to stimulate the little gray cells instead of eroding them, Fringe is one way to get your fix.

B000EG64XM|5.0|Few paintings have been quite so evocative of the horror of war, particularly of the \\"civil\\" variety, than Salvador Dali's oddly titled \\"Soft Construction in Boiled Beans,\\" but with the apt parenthetical remark \\"(Premonitions of the Spanish Civil War.)\\" I referenced this painting in my review of Hugh Thomas' classic history, straightforwardly entitled [[ASIN:0375755152 The Spanish Civil War: Revised Edition (Modern Library Paperbacks)]]. Orwell's account is poles apart from Thomas' work, which is a scholarly one completed two decades after the war. Orwell's is \\"uptight and personal,\\" his own experiences as an English volunteer fighting on the Republican side, and was written before the war was finished. There are numerous versions extant; mine is a Harvest/HBJ book with an introduction by Lionel Trilling which is so worthwhile I believe it worth the extra effort to find a copy. I first read this book around three decades ago, and must have been in some sort of fog. I thought it was good at the time, but on the re-read, found it far more impressive and memorable.<br /><br />In Trilling's undated introduction, he mentions a graduate student visiting him, and saying, of Orwell: \\"He was a virtuous man.\\" As Trilling says, it was an old-fashioned expression, which he expands upon... \\"...the virtue of not being a genius, of confronting the world with nothing more than one's simple, direct, undeceived intelligence, and a respect for the powers one does have, and the work one undertakes to do\\" ... \\"He tells us that we can understand our political and social life merely by looking around us, he frees us from the need for the inside dope.\\" \\"It is hard to find personalities in the contemporary world who are analogous to Orwell. We have to look for men who have considerable intellectual power but who are not happy in the institutionalized life of intellectuality...\\" Trilling goes on to say that unfortunately, when the book was first published, it sold poorly, was remaindered, and was not even published at all in America.<br /><br />So, the virtuous man of action, with a political conscious, saw the rise of Fascism in the `30's, its various victories, and the inaction of the democracies in the face of this threat, and decided to do more than whine and complain at the local coffee house or pub. He arrived in Spain in the winter of `36-'37. A lover of Spain, he wryly notes that he managed to see only a small section of the northwest corner, Catalonia, with Barcelona as its capital. He received his \\"training\\" at the Lenin Barracks, which, like so much military training, does nothing to prepare you for the actual conditions of war. Among other matters, there was no weapon training... due to shortages, all the weapons were at the front! (Though Orwell does not explicitly say this, the shortage was due to the arms embargo that France and England had imposed on the Republicans... not wanting to get involved, and all that... while Germany and Italy supplied Franco with bountiful arms. The Soviet Union did supply the Republicans... on a selective basis, and Orwell does describe that).<br /><br />Orwell is sent to the front, in short order. For almost four months, four winter months, there was virtually no fighting, so one of the chief occupations was finding firewood to stay warm, and trying to keep the lice off you. He was, somewhat accidentally, assigned to a P.O.U.M unit (Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista). It was an \\"Anarchist\\" unit. Orwell provides some wonderfully lucid descriptions of the various political factions, principally the Anarchists and the Communists. The Anarchists wanted to promote the revolution, and the destruction of the existing bourgeois class order; the Communists wanted to preserve it!  Yes, it seems counterintuitive now, and that is one of the beauties of Orwell's explanation. After four months at the front, Orwell has earned some leave, and returns to Barcelona, in time to witness, and even participate in the streetfighting between the POUM units and the Communist-led ones. Orwell painstakingly struggles to provide an objective account of events, and then contrasts it with the outlandish versions that were \\"spun\\" in various newspapers, to conform with preconceived ideas.<br /><br />Orwell returned to the front in May, and was shortly thereafter shot by a sniper through the throat. He provides an almost detached, clinical description of this event, and then went on to describe the rather pathetic state of medical care of the time.

Orwell painstakingly struggles to provide an objective account of events, and then contrasts it with the outlandish versions that were \\"spun\\" in various newspapers, to conform with preconceived ideas.   Orwell returned to the front in May, and was shortly thereafter shot by a sniper through the throat. He provides an almost detached, clinical description of this event, and then went on to describe the rather pathetic state of medical care of the time.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|I read all the Sookie Stackhouse books before watching any of \\"True Blood\\".  True Blood goes off in different directions from the books, leaving (with me) a very different impression, maybe because when one reads, one to some extent creates the emphasis, but TV is more aggressive in emphasizing what it wants.  At first I enjoyed the expanded characters of Lafayette, Jason, and Tara, but I found that about halfway through season 1, these TV plot lines, particularly the endless scenes of Jason having sex and being an idiot, began to pall.  Too much sex, too much  blood, much less humor than the books.  My favorite feature of the books -- Sookie's matter of fact acceptance of vamps and shapeshifters, expecting them to behave according to the rules of civilized society -- is much less evident in the TV show.  Eric, a favorite in the books, isn't much in evidence in Season 1, but he gets off to a very unpleasan start -- hard to see how I could come to like him.  That said, the quality of the script, acting, photography, set, and everything else I notice about the TV show is really excellent, although different from the books.  Anna Paquin is a perfect Sookie, and Bill is so wonderful I can't understand how any fans can still prefer Eric.  I hope later episodes just please cut back on the number of sex scenes.  Sex, especially as Jason does it, really can be dull.
B0042QNP2S|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moN84MF0L4CNXA]]Just received this truck in the mail from Amazon, packed nicely, via UPS. Immediatly checked the parts that other reviewers stated as received broken and the one I received looks to be in tack without any broken parts. I moved the red collection arms that pick-up the trash cans and they are fine. I turned the back side knob that moves the packing panel and trash to the inner compartment and had no problem with that either. Only rated 4 stars since it has not yet been played with by my son as this will be his Christmas present. I will have to wait then to see how durable the parts really are and will update my review later. He currently has the Bruder Garbage Man Side Loader and Loves It! We have had that truck for one month now without any problems.  **UPDATE(12/3/2011)-I finally took it out of the box for an overall test before I wrap it up. Video upload shows the Truck I received does infact work.

B004EPZ07U|1.0|I am an avid Blu-Ray/ DVD collector and love owning the physical disc for my collection.  HOWEVER, I enjoy the digital copy initiative so that I can take movies on the road with me and watch on an airplane.  Most digital copy schemes enable an iTunes download so that they are easily made available via iPad/iTunes downloads.  HOWEVER, Warner Brothers has decided to go pure Ultraviolet and therefore you cannot download the movie you have legally purchased to iTunes and you are forced to STREAM the movie.    I spend thousands of dollars a year on disc purchases and this scheme is a fraud.  I will boycott any further WB Ultraviolet discs!  The movie isn't great to begin with so to make owning it a chore is completely ridiculous.  Buy this movie from iTunes if you must have it for your collection.    Also - as a note I will not purchase any Amazon movies until they make their video compatible with iTunes.  I prefer to buy music from Amazon because it is universally usable.  do  the same with the Amazon Video.    Warner Brothers - you have screwed your customers.  Amazon - you have a obligation to better explain WB use of ultraviolet to your customers!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|This review may contain minor spoilers...  Woody Allen's 41st film opens with several minutes of exquisite shots of Paris set to Jazz music. Cinematographer Darius Khondji elegantly captures these beautiful sites and effectively sets the tone for the film in which Owen Wilson plays Gil Pender, a Hollywood screenwriter working on his first novel while in Paris with his fiancée Inez. After running into old acquaintances Paul and Carol (Michael Sheen and Nina Arianda), Gil goes on a walk to get away from it all and finds himself transported to the 1920s France, an era that he adores. There, he meets literary and cultural giants such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald, Picasso, Gertrude Stein, and Salvador Dalí, among others. He also meets and becomes fascinated with Adriana (Marion Cotillard), Picasso's mistress, whose ideas about time are in synch with Gil's own.  From the first frame, Midnight in Paris is one of Allen's most charming films in years. I've never seen a Woody Allen film I didn't like and there are only a few I wouldn't bother watching again. The general consensus is that his recent films are weak, especially in comparison to his earlier work. I am of the opinion that he's never made a bad film and each new film he made would be held in higher regard if not for the (many) films that had come before it. Whatever your stance is on Allen's films, both past and present, I think you'll agree that this is one of his best films in years. All of the elements; the casting, the setting, the style, and the story come together perfectly to create a magical romantic-comedy/fantasy. Midnight in Paris has many references to classic literature and film that certain audiences may not catch, but this movie is just so likeable that knowledge of the subjects involved is not necessary to enjoy it. It may cause you to seek it out after the film has ended however, but since when is knowledge a bad thing? It's certainly an accessible film, make no mistake about it, but it's also for a certain audience. If you're the casual moviegoer, you'll find little to dislike about it. If you're part of the audience this is intended for, you'll find almost nothing to dislike about it.  The musical score is so brilliant that it couldn't possibly be original. While many parts of the score are recognizably made of classic jazz music and some Cole Porter songs, I figured the main theme was original; alas, there is no original score for the film. The use of music and the music used is brilliant, as well as essential to the effervescent tone of the film. I can't rave enough about Khondji's cinematography as it truly evokes the beauty of Paris and captures it in exactly the idealized way that Gil sees it. The whole film is beautifully shot, from the first frame to the last. The cinematography is a loving testament to the otherworldly beauty of Paris and the beautiful sites that the camera lovingly lingers on makes the film work almost as a visual tour of the city, but don't think for a minute that this is a bad thing. This is a fantasy film and Khondji makes Paris appear as the ultimate fantasy.  As usual, Allen has assembled a wonderful cast lead by Owen Wilson in the Woody Allen role. Wilson shares some of the same mannerisms and speech patterns we'd expect if Allen played the role, but brings a distinct giddiness that only Wilson can convey. Gil is a memorable, extremely likeable protagonist whose wide-eyed wonder reflected my own. Allen never misses a chance to take jabs at pedantic, pseudo-intellectuals and Michael Sheen plays one perfectly, providing some great back-and-forth banter with Gil. Every actor makes an impression with their characters, with Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy being especially funny and well utilized as Inez's judgmental, materialistic parents. The historical figures throughout the film are given wonderful characterizations, with Corey Stoll turning in a vivacious, poetic performance as Hemingway and KathyBates making Gertrude Stein exude warmth and intelligence. Adrien Brody has an inspired cameo as the great surrealist Salvador Dalí and his scene was certainly a highlight (\\"I see...rhinoceros\\"). With the First Lady of France, Carla Bruni, making an appearance as well, Allen's strong group of actors are one of the driving forces behind the reason this movie works so well.  Midnight in Paris features some of Allen's best writing years. The characters are well-developed of course, but the story is more inspired than usual. The dialogue is clever and witty (one of my favorite examples being Gil suggesting the plot of The Exterminating Angel to director Luis Buñuel). Allen even takes a moment to take some light-hearted jabs at Tea Party politics. The \\"earrings scene\\" meanwhile is the most well-executed comedic scene that Allen has filmed in some time. This is Allen's 41st theatrical film since 1972 and while he's admittedly had some hits and misses, he proves that at the age of 75 he's still capable of churning out a genuinely great film. After making a huge per-theatre average on only six screens, Sony slowly expanded Midnight in Paris and it has consistently remained in the top 10 movies at the box office since. This is a huge feat for a Woody Allen film. Audiences have responded because Allen has made a charming, lovely, whimsical fantasy film that shows Allen at his most accessible and most consistent. With 41 films under his belt it's hard to say where Midnight in Paris fares amongst those other releases, but based on sheer likeability and quality I can safely say it's my favorite film of 2011 thus far.  GRADE: A
B004A1Y4UM|5.0|Though I'm a longtime metal fan, Volbeat was a band unknown to me until I caught a hint of \\"Warrior's Call\\" on a rock radio station.  If you enjoy hard rock / metal in general, almost certainly you will like this.  Think kind of a cross between Metallica and Lynyrd Skynyrd, with some Queensryche-like voice work and just a touch of Aerosmith lyrics (!) thrown in for fun.<br /><br />The Amazon previews for this album do an EXCELLENT job of sampling the overall sound and feel of the album.  Listen to them twice and go with your gut instinct.<br /><br />Opinion:  This is an awesome album with very few weaknesses.  Great beat, great guitar work, recognizable catchy tunes and clear, understandable vocals.  (A bit of ruh-ruh-ruh death-metal-y screeches do find their way into one track.)  Some singing might be a bit too 'twangy' for hardcore metalheads.  Me?  I love this album and can't stop listening to it.

B003MC5N28|4.0|\\"The Giver\\" is the first book in a trilogy, although I understand the story doesn't really continue for the main character Jonas.  This is a young adult book, and I can see why many teachers enjoy using this to spark discussion.  It is short and easy to read, although it is filled with a lot of controversial topics that would be a wonderful source of discussion.<br /><br />As the book unfolds, you slowly learn about a utopian society, but you start to realize they've paid a high price for \\"sameness\\".  I find this somewhat similar to what Americans are doing for a sense of safety from terrorists and evil in general.  Americans are willingly giving up many liberties for an assurance (or similitude of one) that they won't be attacked.<br /><br />The geek inside of me struggled with some of the concepts in the book regarding memories and technology.  This colored my review a little, but I still think this is a great book for middle-school aged kids to read and more importantly discuss with parents and/or their teacher and class.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This movie is incredible!  First off, the cinematography is beautiful.  The techniques used were unique.

Make sure the sound is up too!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I am usually very critical of \\"Book-to-Movie\\" movies... They are generally very disappointing to me.  After reading this incredible book, our library gave away free tickets to see the movie.  I went, but was prepared to be disappointed.  I was BEYOND pleased with the movie!  The characters were perfectly cast, and the story kept enough of the details that you really felt all of the emotion of the book--- You will laugh, you will cry, and you will love the characters by the end of the movie.  This is definitely a movie worth adding to your collection!  :)

B001BPQT8A|5.0|David Fincher is a director who has had an amazing career with his latest highlight being THE SOCIAL NETWORK.  But a film that was praised by the critics but overlooked at the Oscars is one of his very best - SE7EN. It is amazing to believe that it came out in 1995.  It was a ratrity in its time being a true horror film while at the same time being an intense, intelligent deep psychological thriller.  The blu ray is amazing and the film certainly stands the test of time.  The movie is an absorbing, shocking and frightening tale of society, man, sin and the fine line that there is between good and evil and lives on in grand style on this glorious blu ray.  The film is dark and takes place in a city with no name.  Everything is aging, decrepid and depressing.  But the black/white levels on the blu ray are superb and the detail and clarity are amazing throughout.  Colors though subdued are still very realistic and pop naturally as do skin tones.  The crispness of the pictures adds a whole new level of intensity to the film.  And the audio is a mindblower with its 7.1 lossless DTS track.  Dialogue is strong and present and surround speakers are put to excellent use.  The disc also comes packaged in a superb digibook excellently crafted with much info on the film.  There are also tons of extras on the disc.<br /><br />I highly recommend SE7EN.  This is a film that is indeed a classic.  It has standout performances by Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey.  It is also a film that is not gratuitous in its horror.  It serves a purpose and the way it is utilized makes it linger with you that much longer.  This film is so well crafted in every aspect that repeat viewings will be a must.  I remembered the whole story line when I first watched this blu ray and it in no way ruined the experience.  The knowing of things actually added to the trepidation and appreciiation of how superb the film actually is.<br /><br />Luckily I received my blu ray packaged in a cardboard box but I have had the experience many have had here with other films from Amazon where bubble wrap packaging ruined a digibook.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is an extremely useful little app. Very feature rich and dependable. Love the shake to kill the alarm option.
1400096936|5.0|It's that good IMO. Winslows written some great books, but to my mind this is the best (slightly ahead of California Fire & Life). Fierce, gruesome, engrossing, and sadly affecting. It is the story of a DEA Agents decades long quest to destroy the drug dealing Barrerra family. Along the way Mr. Winslow weaves in so many of the events and myths of the drug wars that is just makes it even more fascinatin. The assassination attempt on the religious figure, the CIA, Crack cocaine, the Mexico City Earthquake, the Narco cowboy with the awfully decorated house, the drug dealer undergoing plastic surgery to hide himself, the drug dealers disappearing for years at a time, the Columbian drug wars connection, the torture of the DEA agent, the mild mannered kingpin who is the accounting & marketing genius. This book has it all.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Fantastic album with a very cool and diversified sound. Jambi is incredible and so is most of the other songs on the album.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|Straight to the point. This movie was what I thought was my ideal movie, cowboy sci-fi action thriller. What could go wrong? I'll tell what went wrong the entire middle of this movie is stupid. It loses it's way. The story could have been so much better if they would have figured out the end before the beginning. Just seems like they where winging it.
B004T4LUPW|3.0|Just got this app this morning and love it. Do NOT love the fact that it is now available for half of what I paid! (3 star rating reflects that, otherwise would be 5.)<br /><br />I particularly like the Agenda view, where I can see everything coming up. Will be very useful.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|OFFICE SPACE is a film from 1999 believe it or not but it is from the comedy legend Mike Judge.  Written and directed by Judge with wit, realism and spot on observations this film about the everyday work place truly stands the test of time.  It inded deserves the cult following it has acquired and reigns in a class all its own as it satirizes the American worker so perfectly.  The story has a purpose but also provides laughs from beginning to end that often turn into side splitting belly laughs.  The entire cast is excellent with Ron Livingston, Stephen Root and Gary Cole in particular reigning supreme.  Livingston shines and makes the whole story line seem very plausible and helps the viewer care for all the characters.  And it is so much fun to see an early Jennifer Anniston and you will never forget her dealing with her flair after this film.<br /><br />Blu ray is indeed a magic worker and this film looks excellent on blu ray.  The video is crisp, clear, bright with colors that pop and realistic flesh tones.  Black/white ratio is superb and it is the added clarity that tuly brings this film to a new dimension.  The audio is also excellent.  This is a dialogue driven film and it is always crisp and clear.  When music is present it comes out of the surround speakers pefectly never overshadowing the dialogue.  The entire film comes to new life on blu ray.  If you love this film and own the dvd double dipping for the blu ray is a must.  The viewing experience is truly superior to the dvd.  And if you are an OFFICE SPACE virgin the excellent blu ray at this great price makes it a no brainer.  Its story and humor truly stand the test of time.  Highly recommend.
B003Y5H5C4|3.0|I'll keep it short and simple:<br /><br />The cast is awesome and I love these guys in this flick. It only has a few LOL moments though and the story ain't too bad but EVERY OTHER WORD in this movie is f***!!!!

Don't get me wrong, \\"F\\" is a great word, I use it on a day to day basis and i love it, but in this movie it's way way over used.<br /><br />Anyhow - it's worth a watch but not to buy.

B003PBB4ME|1.0|I don't quite understand this product. First off, the current shipments are defective because you cannot attach it to your tripod as advertised. Definitely bummed by that. Second, all the pieces of the unit are hard and rigid so the camera does not float as you move. When you move, the camera moves, so how does this prevent camera shake -- or stabilize. I thought I would try it after seeing the video of the kids skating with it, but now I realize they probably used stabilization filters during editing -- arrgh! DO NOT BUY this item.

0670022411|2.0|I started reading this novel after seeing it on the New Releases table at my local bookstore. It reminded me of a cross between \\"The Historian\\" by Elizabeth Kostova, and the \\"Sookie Stackhouse\\" novels by Charlaine Harris... in other words, a book with interesting historical background, and a mildly intriguing magical plot, but with a female character who is insipid and ridiculous and, ultimately, completely shallow. While the author tried to make Diana a rounded character, she failed with me; Diana was boring, a woman who alternated the entire novel between crying and trying to sleep with the dark and sexy (stereotype much?) vampire.   But all that said, I kept reading, because I wanted to know what would happen at the end. I tried to ignore the hastily thrown-in plot \\"twist\\" at the end, hoping instead that somehow, the novel would resolve itself. But as the last few pages grew close, I realized with a start that this novel was one of those annoying works that is the first in a series, but doesn't bother to let you know at the beginning!  So there you have it. Ultimately unsatisfying, although not really anything special to begin with. I don't care if the sequel comes out tomorrow, I still won't read it, because I absolutely detest authors who pull readers into this trap, not telling them that they're starting a series! Who wants to read 500+ pages with no resolution at the end?
B002WPVNOS|5.0|From the first phrase of \\"Secrets,\\" I was captivated. One Republic's album, \\"Waking Up\\" is simply incredible. Rarely do I buy an entire album, but this was absolutely an exception.  After listening to \\"Secrets,\\" I was curious to listen to more. Each song is filled with genuine emotion; each song is filled with memories of a relatable past. Each song stirs feelings of \\"almost-memories\\" for me, reminding me of something powerful I felt long ago, but can't quite remember.  One Republic is truly talented, utilizing an amazing balance to bring forth beautiful harmony. Aside from incredibly deep lyrics, their cellist makes a huge difference. Playing a string instrument with a humanistic range, the cellist almost seems to play my own heart's strings, pulling me into the song's emotional setting regardless of the mood I am in. Furthermore, each member of the band is extremely creative and gifted. Many play unique instruments, creating unparalleled music unlike anything you have ever heard. Without hesitation, I would recommend this album to all buyers regardless of their taste in music.
B004WJRJ18|2.0|Unfortunately I was disappointed with the sound quality of this vinyl re-issue by Friday Music. The sound has no vinyl clarity, warmth and depth. The same I can tell about Friday Music re-issue of Deep Purple \\"Burn\\" album on vinyl that was released this year. They both sound no better than the CDs.
1594744769|3.0|This was a very peculiar story and one that those who love fantasy will enjoy. I was engrossed until about half way through and then I began to lose interest.  I can't say exactly why, but the clue might be in that I was able to skim the rest of it and get along fine.  But that's just me. I'm not into fantasy much. If I were to be the judge then Harry Potter and the Twilght series wouldn't be the blockbusters they are. So that ought to tell a potenial reader a lot about my reading preferences.  The premise of the story (at least to me) is that those who are odd need to be sheltered from the world, but even then there are those who will try to destroy them. Miss Peregrine keeps her home for peculiar children some of whom can levitate, are invisible, have super human strength, can make fire with their hands, or, like the protaganist has the power to see evil disquised. She also keeps them living in one day over and over and over again until some of these children (who by now whould be old if thrust into the real world of passing time) grow quite bored with their lives. The day is Sept 3, 1940. The author left the story with room for a sequel.
B000IY03CS|5.0|Esta recopilacion de 3 discos no tiene igual, sobretodo el tercer disco, siempre he dicho que las canciones del lado B de George Michael son excelentes y es por eso que este disco vale la pena comprarlo.
0307891372|2.0|I previously had the Oblivion Prima guide which was an absolute masterpiece. So I bought this guide hoping it was similar. The problem is they jammed too much information into each page and the size of the text is too small to read easily. Combined with a weird tall font, it's the first book I've ever had trouble reading in my life and I have reasonably good vision.  It has lots of content but if you have to struggle to read it, what good is it? I find it hard to believe the editor looked at this book and said \\"yeah I like it\\". But obviously someone did.  So if you're young and can read tiny fonts, this book is fine. Otherwise - caveat emptor. I cannot recommend as it is.
B005IZLPMY|3.0|Captain America: The First Avenger culminated what I call \\"The Summer of Superheroes\\", though not at all in the way I had hoped it would. It's a decent flick, but it takes forever to get going. I spent the entire first half of the movie pleading for it to pick up the pace and then when it finally did, I was disappointed because it ramped up the action, but then seemed to resolve the conflict too quickly, leaving the ending to be a complete disaster. As far as the cast is concerned, I thought Chris Evans did a fine job as Steve Rogers / Cap and I loved Tommy Lee Jones as Col. Phillips. I also really liked Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark. Hayley Atwell was OK, but didn't really stand out at all and Hugo Weaving did the best he could with the material he was given. Overall, a decent movie, though certainly not Marvel's best as it lacks a solid story and in-depth character development, but it's worth a rent at the very least.
0887431453|4.0|Well i got the workbook pretty fast and was in great conditions.  Did not have and bent pages or anything..
B004EPYZQ2|2.0|It is a kids movie with marijuana. What is the target audience for this film? Not for adults and Kids can not watch it!  Take Goonies (kids experimenting?), Close Encounters (the grand evacuation), ET (in the end, the alien was a misunderstood cutie), Transformers (the self assembling cubes), Cloverfield (the monster is a reduced copy, and at least Cloverfield was a very original movie, despite being a financial disaster), a totally unnecessary joint (for the funny guy) and a giant industrial blender (to put all the aforementioned together in a soapbox format) and you have this movie. Nothing original and truly disappointing.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this series after hearing about it from a friend. One word: AMAZING. Def a good read, young adult or not so young adult.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Esta pelicula es la mejor pelicula epica que he visto en mi vida, bien otorgado el oscar a Mel Gibson, aunque tiene sus pequeños errores de edicion que pasan desapercibidos por la majestucidad de la pelicula vale la pena recomendarla, que pena que el audio no lo hayan remasterizado a DTS, ojala a futuro.
B005YVSFT8|5.0|Season 1 would be best described as an immediate struggle for survival and adaptation to a post-apoc (ie Zombie takeover) type world. While it has a variety of characters it has direct confrontations with the Walkers in an urban type (even if you are outside direct city limits) atmosphere as people seek answers to what has happened and its extent.  Season 2 would be best described as Part2 to post-apoc living. Now that you are sure everything is FUBAR in the population centers the focus turns to how a group of survivors adapts to daily life as they get stranded in the country. The episode focuses on the intense conflict the stress of the new world provides.   Season 2, moves a little slower, focuses a bit less on Walkers and direct confrontations. It moves into a more developed drama in many ways. For me it took Episode 3or4 before I really warmed into the new location and couldn't wait for the next episode. Having finished Episode 6, I reflect upon this season as having been well developed.   Season 1 and Season 2 have the same genera / background, but they are certainly different in approach. Season 2 is not a continuation of the same, it really evolves from Stage 1 to Stage 2 of the crisis. Again I think this is good as trying to continue direct confrontations with Walkers would run out of originality and be a boring repeat. Instead, the show quickly shifted to a new focus that is running a nice course.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Most of the important things are up front. It's pretty,too. but I really wish forecast was included in the front screen.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|love angry birds it is so addicting and fun. my kids won't leave my phone alone most days! the seasons is harder than the others in my opinion.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|The movie had the potential to be good. It had reasonable actors and a budget that allowed for good costumes, location,sets and fx. However the acting was stiff, the script was...bad...beyond bad. it was anti climactic and predicable.There was no twist, there was no imagination. I can say the only good thing here is the fan service on Jason Momoa's posterior. That's it...and it lasts like .9 seconds.  I was disappointed. I don't see a sequel.
0316098329|3.0|I don't know if I liked this book or not.  I'm really in the middle of the road.  I read this for book club. This definitely was not my cup of tea. I read for light hearted fun...and this was the opposite.  I understood that this book had heavy content, so I knew what I was getting myself into.  I won't get into the details because I don't really feel like discussing it more than once.  I'm saving myself for my book club meeting.  In a nut shell, the book was told from the point of view of a five year old boy. A boy who spent the first 5 years of his life in a room alone with his mother. No outside contact. Just his \\"ma\\", a TV, random made up games and man who he calls \\"Old Nick\\", who comes sometimes as night and brings them Sunday Treats.  The story is about a woman and her son escaping a man who kept them prisoner in this cork padded, room behind his house. It's crazy and sick really.  She was kidnapped and held there for 6-7 years.  During her imprisonment, she had two babies by this lunatic, which her first baby was stillborn.  Once Jack turns five things start changing very fast.  Jack's Ma finally thinks he is old enough to help them escape.  She thinks up a plan, and amazingly, Jack succeeds.  Once they escape little Jake must adapt to the world \\"outside\\".  The book follows them as they are reintegrated into the world, in Jack's case, newly introduced.  It's a sad and unfortunately situation.  But thankfully, the end of the story leads us to believe Jack and his Ma will heal from this ordeal.
B004UXUWYM|5.0|Johnny Depp plays the role of Paul Kemp a journalist who travels to San Juan. Kemp fit's right in with his cronies as a hard drinking journalist. Johnny Depp stays true to the book by his friend Hunter S. Thompson. Lot's of laughs. I found it to be the funnest movie I've seen in many years.
B004T4LUPW|2.0|I downloaded this app after seeing it recommended on Lifehacker. It was a waste of $2.99. CalenGoo is very bland and clunky and the widgets are bland as well. Business Calendar blows this out of the water.   I do not recommend this app.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|This had the heavy duty quality I wanted at a decent price.   I used it to replace a cheaper, damaged product and believe this new one will easily withstand the environment that did the first one in.    This has a much stronger feel.  It may not work in places with tight/very short twists and turns, but it traverse well between the components of my entertainment console.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun, calming game. I did end up with it resetting on its own somehow, but I enjoy it, so not a huge prob. Worth the buck. But WHERE is Quell Reflect?!  iPhone already has it in their app store...come on guys! Hate being left in the dust because I'm not using an Apple product.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|This series is one of the best ever made.  From beginning to end, the viewer is kept guessing.  Drama, intrigue, mystery, action, all wrapped around a well written plot. If you're a fan of the original Battlestar Galactica series, examine first WHY you lked the original.  Unlike that series, there is no simplicity to this one.  It is very in depth, with truly exceptional acting, and relative subplots.  You can truly see the work and artistic effect in this series, and yet the actors themselves are so true to character it doesn't even look like acting.  Superb series.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I liked the smaller size of the 405CX, but after using it for a short time, I wish I'd opted for the 305 model.  While the 305 is larger and not as nice looking as this model, it works far better.  My husband has the 305 and has not had any issues with it.  First, the 405CX's bezel is a real pain to use (however, once locked, it's fine). Second, the GPS elevation is not accurate.  Third, I've used the model with and without the heartrate monitor to discover a HUGE discrepancy between the two.  Garmin's answer:  it's more accurate with the heart-rate monitor.  I purchased mine back in February and it completely stopped working in October.  I've spoken with others who own this device, they all agree that it's NOT user friendly and NOT reliable.  Don't waste your money.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|I bought this in advance of the release just because of the downloadable copy, but when it finally got here I found out that it is not really a downloadable copy at all!  This is total misadvertizing and I want my money back, but because it is already opened, I cannot.  What a shame.  Amazon should do something to compensate!
B000E1MXSW|4.0|I've been going through a number of \\"old\\" films that my parents dragged me to as a kid and I couldn't make head nor tail of back then. This is the story of a Belgian \\"DK (doc's kid)\\" (Audrey Hepburn) who becomes a nun, and offers a lot of insight on the Catholic church's teaching of near self-hatred to its nuns. The late George Carlin didn't even scratch the surface of that issue in some of his sketches about being raised in Catholic schools. Carlin was doubtlessly far from the only person tipped over into agnosticsm by that factor. Hepburn's Sister Luke is a bit tougher, but she still has her problems. For example, she develops a number of \\"BFF\\" friendships, only to find out that friendship with any mortal is considered disloyal to God. At one point Sister Luke is pressured into deliberately failing an exam qualifying her for the mission in a hospital in the Congo because she would have outscored another novice who was preferred for the post. She meets a number of teaching sisters who are not as extreme as others in this viewpoint. Indeed, George Carlin's not seeking a career in the Church meant he didn't know the half of it about how humility can morph over into beating up on yourself. As well as becoming so ingrained into the system that it becomes institututionalized. Eventually Sister Luke ends up having a crisis of conscience over the outbreak of World War II that forces her to re-examine her conflicting identities as a nun and as a Belgian.<br /><br />One accidental bit of childish humor in this film concerns the practice of Congolese villagers of calling Sister Luke \\"Mama Luke\\". When I got to school a few days later I learned that some of my classmates had also seen the film. Especially the Italian guys, who were amused by the fact that \\"Mama Luke\\" sounded like one insult in Italian that was sort of vulgar. With a lot of this film's interior shooting done in Italy, it's strange that one didn't get caught.
B0044430H8|5.0|When I first saw the movie at the theaters my first impression of the soundtrack was that it was electronic and, much like TRON Legacy, it's supposed to complement the theme of computers and technology. Given that I like instrumentals and electronica I decided to buy it. After giving the album a few listens as a whole I couldn't help be reminded of the glorious days in the '90s when I used to play Sim City 3000. In particular, the track \\"In Motion\\" totally harkens back to when you're starting a new game and setting up a new city and you're laying out the land and the utilities (pipes, electric poles, water etc) as well as the movie visuals of Mark Zuckerberg coding up Facesmash. Every song contributes to a different mood and it they complement the film nicely. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross sure did a great job with this. I can't wait to hear The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Anywho, I highly recommend this album to anyone who wants something constructive to listen to when doing some mental activity like homework, math puzzles, geometric proofs or programming. It's very awesome and it really grows on you fast.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|Percy Jackson and the lightning thief   Percy Jackson returns in this astonishing book full of adventures and exhilaration. In the beginning of this amazing story, Percy finds himself getting forced out of boarding school once again. As you begin to flip through the pages you start to discover that leaving school is the least of his worries. In one of the first encounters with Percy and the mythological creatures, he finds that the monsters are much closer to him and his protectors, than anyone could ever predict. He soon realized that some of the monsters were aiming to hurt him, when his own teacher, Mrs.Dodds turned into a grotesque monster. She grew talons and black feathers in the blink of an eye as she turned into one of the only three remaining furies in the underworld. Until that day Percy had never heard or seen anything close to what this was...this was the beginning of the story that changed his life forever. Percy soon realized that his close friend Grover has always been a satyr. For Percy noticed that Grover was always the person who stayed in the background, until that day. For that day Grover took charge over Percy, for that was his lifelong task. Grover soon told Percy that he was endangered, because he was a demi-god. At first it was hard to believe for him, but after seeing what happened to Ms.Dodds, it suddenly became easier. Once Percy noticed the truth, Grover told him that he was endangered, because Zeus's lightning bolt was stolen. The most precious item ever to be a part of the universe had been stolen. Percy didn't understand why he was endangering at first, because he didn't take the lightning bolt. However Grover soon told Percy that he was a prime suspect. For Percy was the son of Poseidon and Poseidon was the brother of Zeus, and for many years Zeus and Poseidon had been in a huge feud. Zeus thinks this is a way for pay back. So now Percy has just ten days to find the thief and return the bolt before the ten days are up and the beginning of the war that would end the world starts. In order to complete this quest, Percy and his friends must face the oracle and unravel its mind-altering riddles; he must also face the father that walked out on him! If he is successful in this quest he will have unraveled a betrayal more powerful than the Gods of Mount Olympus themselves! Want to find out if he does? If he comes to terms with his father? Or if the riddle is solved? Well...Read more into this mind blowing book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I started with the sample of this book and by the end of that, I wanted to keep reading. I hate how expensive so many of the books still are for the Kindle (thanks to the big publishing houses)and didn't want to spend the $12.99 if I could get it at the library instead, so I tried my library first. When they didn't have it, I decided to spend the money because I really wanted to keep reading it. Thankfully, I wasn't disappointed! The story is incredibly moving and well written. I enjoyed being able to hear from both Vinnie and Belle, becoming equally attached to each character. I love historical fiction and this storyline felt new, a story that brings the histories of slavery and indentured servitude together instead of holding them separately, while respecting the differences. I hope to see further works by Kathleen Grissom soon.
B004G600A4|5.0|The marketing for Tangled made me not want to see it.  In fact, I waited until I was able to borrow it from a library because I knew I didn't want to spend any money on it.  I was completely surprised by it, and will be getting it.  I really enjoyed the music and the story was cute as well.  It's Disney, so it was semi-predictable in the overall story, but a lot of the small comments and facial expressions of the characters really made it entertaining.  You've got to remember, this is not the classic telling of a fairy tale; it's a modernized version with all the attitudes and thoughts of today.  I thought the music was much better than the music in the Princess and the Frog (in fact I didn't like the Princess and the Frog, I feel that they had potential but didn't see it through).  Even my husband really enjoyed Tangled (and he doesn't like a lot of the animation out there).    SPOILER ALERT:  I'm an adult, and have not been with a kid to watch this, but after reading some of the lower rating comments I have to wonder.  In the prologue the guy says that he is talking about the day he died, so it shouldn't have been a shock to people.  I do agree that the Mother Knows Best song could be confusing for some kids if they don't understand how Repunzel has been living a lie her whole life without knowing it and how manipulative the mother is, but I thought it was a really good song and was sung very well, in fact, it's one of my favorite songs from the movie.  There is a lot of sarcasm in the movie, so if kids can't tell the difference, they may take too many of the statements seriously.    Maybe this isn't for young kids, but older, mature kids should find this to be a fun movie(again, no personal experience with the kids).
B005QKYIZ2|5.0|Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, Bowie, Prince (at his most sane), is all that can be thought to compare to this driving, relentless, emotional, dominating, brilliance. This women is only 25; frightening.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I got the blu ray set, 8 movies for $80 on Amazon. My ONLY complaint is that the disk art is not cohesive. They will likely publish a box set and redesign all the dvd labels to match more, but this one just has whatever the original art work was for each disk. Really NOT a big deal unless you're into owning awesome looking box sets. But for $10 a disk, I really don't mind! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read a lot of adult science fiction and fantasy. It was refreshing to read a young adult oriented story that was as detailed and riveting as this. My hat's off to Suzanne Collins.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Would be great if it had shoutcast (like xiia), but the quality is here. Besides radio it has podcasts and local police -fire. Also like recording feature for spoken word (which puts me to sleep). Easy to use UI.
B00506FFYU|5.0|You can get this set at Lego.com for $149.00.  This is a nice set but not as hard to find as the resellers hoped. Don't fall for the hype! Shop around!
B004SBX112|5.0|I haven't had any problems or ads what so ever. I have all 3 angry birds. This one has a theme for almost every season and it grows. This one is a little more difficult in my opinion than the other two angry birds, so that'll be good for those that want more challenge. In all a wonderful game, I love it.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|I've seen Madonna. She puts on a great show, but I missed this concert so I ordered the DVD. First thing first, THIS IS THE BEST ENTRANCE I'VE EVER SEEN OF ANY CONCERT IN MY LIFE! It was simply amazing. The dancing, or what I should write, the dancers who were dancing as if they were horses, yes, I wrote HORSES, as in SUGARFOOT from WOODY WOODPECKER, MR. ED, you get it, were amazing. This concert is creative, fun and you'll find yourself mesmerized then suddenly getting up to dance as if you're on stage with her and her amazing talented dancers. Watching the dancers will get most humans physically exhausted. I enjoy this DVD so much that I often use it as a work-out motivator. Madonna is purely one of the best entertainers I've ever witnessed - and did I mention her body? She looks amazing, she's always have, and daaaaang, da gal is like in her late 40s when she did this tour. Talk about an inspiration. I love this DVD so much, I think I'll spend the additional dough to get it on Blue-ray - it's just THAT good.
B003L77G06|5.0|I purchased this series for $8.99 from amazon.com during the Black Friday deals week.  It includes the entire second season and a few extras (though not many).<br /><br />The case is slim, and the discs all stay put pretty well.  I'm happy with the quality of packaging.  Now onto the show.<br /><br />I watched the second season originally from the local library (yes my library has many copies of this season), though it took me a few weeks to get bumped up on the request list.  I had recently finished season one and was craving more of the delightful comedy of this series.<br /><br />Though season one may have been a little more fun, there is plenty of hilarity during this season.  For those who don't know, this series was created by the team that brought Frasier to us.  Quality shows both.  The writing is excellent and the actors play well to their talents and stay true to their characters.<br /><br />What this show is about is making odd family and lifestyle situations work in a crazy and fast paced world.  The show is actually set up as a Scandanavian reality show.  I don't know if this was ever mentioned on the actual show, but it is mentioned on the website and mentioned during the commentary in season one.  I think it was for Norwegian television.  They wanted a reality show showing a slice of American family life.  So that is why you have the periodic asides where family members talk to the camera, or the occasional sideways glance at the camera during normal scenes.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the show, you should probably catch a few of the early episodes of season one, but it is not required.  There aren't really any spoilers and each episode pretty much stands alone with few story arcs carrying over to multiple episodes.<br /><br />One actor who delighted me by appearing was Nathan Lane playing 'Pepper'.  Hilarious!<br /><br />This is not your ordinary family life drama.  It features one somewhat normal appearing household that ends up being the most dysfunctional of the bunch, a gay couple with an adopted Asian daughter, and an older, rich guy with a much younger, hot Colombian wife and her son.  Queue laughter!  Deserving of each and every Emmy they have won and will continue to win.and an older, rich guy with a much younger, hot Colombian wife and her son.  Queue laughter!

B005PTYOTE|5.0|While it is true that retailers are trying to leverage the upcoming movie to bump sales on this item, who can blame them? For under $30, I get three blu-ray movies. Great price, and they put me in the mood for the newest release. I can't agree with the other reviewers who gig this movie just because there's a new movie on the way. Buy it if you want. Don't if you don't. For me, it seemed like a good buy.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|I bought 2 of these now because the first one had an awful buzzing noise (Like most Turtle beach wireless headsets) The second one also did. TB wireless headsets are just not good. The sound is great, but the buzzing you will hear nonstop is so loud you can hear in with your game volume at max.   I would not recomend TB at all. Other headsets are just as good and cheaper. Plus the TB customer support is god awful.

B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This is a fantastic Sci-Fi/horror movie that goes along with the FireFly series. You don't have to know that series at all to enjoy this movie. This can be categorized in the movie genre as Equilibrium with Christian Bale. Pretty fascinating story-line, GREAT ACTION, and some parts that make you jump or cringe. Highly recommend this to any Sci-Fi fan looking for a good flick (I've watched this with three girlfriends and they like it as well.) You won't be disappointed.
B003VR5PPY|2.0|Actually I said everything in the tag line.  You spend endless minutes tapping the screen to get past the dialog.  And you can't speed that up or skip it.  I found a way to get out of it in under 9 hours - pop it out of your Nintendo and play another game.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We waited for a long time for the Epic. It is difficult! I haven't made it past obstacle 9 yet (except for an accidental drop to obstacle 90 which was exciting)! It's frustrating when you keep making the same mistakes, but it makes you try again and again! Definitely a level up from the original.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|This group just keeps pumping out great music. With every release I am thinking they will fall out, but it does not happen. There are alot of Nickelback haters out there and I just dont understand. I dont hand out 5 star reviews alot, but Nickelback is worthy. It only takes one listen and I'm hooked. Alot of music, you have to listen to like three times and let it grow on you. Not here. Also, it is not your same run of the mill Nickelback, that some say. I believe this to be alot harder rocking release than most. It still has some ballads as well. Lullaby is just awsome. Nickelback stays true to what they do and just keep putting out the hits. Its unreal. Think ACDC. The sound stays the same, but they just keep the party rocking, which most bands these days can not say the same. Great album. Keep up the good work.
B005HWUCMC|5.0|She is truly an amazing artist, and this album in particular is incredible. If you're a fan of Rihanna you certainly won't be disappointed in the quality of this album. Includes numerous hits and it's nice to hear something not played constantly on the radio with the other songs.
B00004WEJZ|2.0|I never really felt like this was a true Bond movie for some reason, but I don't know why.  I like the idea of an older Bond being called back into service.  That would have been a good premise for an original Bond movie, but not a rehash of Thunderball.  Looking back on it all, didn't the producers realize that they were making an almost exact copy of Thunderball?  Oh yeah, Kevin McClory was the producer and he was still angry at Ian Fleming for the novel.  Perhaps this was McClory's attempt to say \\"I can make Thunderball better than you can!\\"  Anyway, Connery does a good job as an older Bond in the game one last time.  The action, gadgets, and humor are all there, but you'll swear you've seen/heard it all before, and you have.  Apparently Kevin McClory sought to do yet another remake of Thunderball in the 90's with Timothy Dalton but nobody was up for it.  I think he was just obsessed with Thunderball, but luckily, new producers came around for other Bond films (not counting A View to a Kill, which was really just a re-telling of Goldfinger).    Hmm, maybe the 80's were just the really low point in the Bond Franchise...
B004TI5N38|4.0|For Baldacci fans, this is a lot better than some of his previous works which appeared (to me) to be written by someone other than David Baldacci. This is typical Baldacci with a complex, interwoven tale that gets your emotions and heartbeat moving a little faster as you read the various situations.  He does a great job of building it up and then slamming the conclusion home, and leaving you wanting a little more.  I would expect to hear of a sequel with the main character in future novels.<br /><br />Not all is peachy-king with this novel, as there is a little bit of preachiness supporting the environmental movement that took a bit away, it's a little unrealistic to believe a lone agent woudl be sent to solve a mystery of this magnitude, and I really wish there had been some background information on the mysterious jailed brother.<br /><br />Overall, however, I thought this was an enjoyable book and a good comeback from Baldacci.

B000066C1N|5.0|First CD I've ever owned, which got me into Bryan Adams. I just bought the CD for the third time. First one I had sadly got old and scratched up.  The second one I found at a pawn shop, then regretfully gave it to a friend about a year later. And now at 20, I just got a new copy from Amazon here, and I'm just tickled pink. Brothers Under the Son is no doubt my favorite track!  (This is my first review.)

B00514HDNW|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. I bought this book as a short story collection on paperback a year or two before the film, starring Will Smith, came out. I had heard about the premise from a family member and i just had to read it. I am not a casual reader, but this story had me hooked. Its a bit dated by todays technological standards, but im still familiar enough with technologies of our past enjoy the scenes.<br /><br />One note: Kindle books should be cheaper and not equivalent to their paperback counterparts in price. Digital products have minimal overhead with no manufacturing and shipping cost involved. I bought this story in a single paperback short story collection for $12. It included more than one story by Richard Matheson. Ok..km stepping down off my soapbox now.

0553582038|3.0|Boy, so many things happen in this book! Lots of events, like people going places and killing other people and getting killed. Just, like, a ton of things constantly going on! So many, that you might have trouble keeping track of who a character is, where they are going, why they are going there, and what possible relevance it might have to all of the other things going on! But don't worry about that, if you get confused about the plot, some other characters will be introduced and they will also go do things that will make you forget about what it was that you were confused about! In summary, if you like a book where lots of things happen, but you don't like to be concerned with why they are happening or if it has a reason, read this book!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I've never read anything by Sanderson, but I found this book to be refreshing and enjoyable. Not highly stylized, but thoughtful and (dare I say?!) original.  Plus, I like an author who willingly explores philosophy, logic, and even a little science and engineering.  Great book!
B005HP2JAM|5.0|\\"Dwarfed by these large chambers illuminated by our wandering lights, sometimes we were overcome by a strange irrational sensation as if we were disturbing the paleolithic people in their work. It felt like eyes upon us. This sensation occurred to some of the scientists and also the discoverer of the cave. It was a relief to surface again above ground.\\" - Werner Herzog.<br /><br />The sense of being in the presence of the immense and sublime is almost overwhelming in this film. The paintings themselves are powerful. They feel human and honest and I felt the artists completely immersed in their subjects. The HD video is among the highest level I've yet seen on Blu-Ray. The score itself grabs your soul and refuses to let go until you admit that your rationality is only pretend and in truth you feel you are face to face with the Gods. Herzog's narration is compassionate and filled with awe for his subject.<br /><br />Not having a 3D TV, I watched the BD at mere 1080p. But all the same, the experience was breathtaking.<br /><br />In particular I was struck by the series of images as a pair of woolly rhinos were being watch by a few cave lions. Those cave lions were in turn being watched by a horde of woolly rhinos. Those rhinos themselves were being watched by a massive pride of yet more lions.<br /><br />Even before discovering that the bonus features focused on the score, I looked up the composer. His name is Ernst Reijseger. His work in this film (all recorded in analogue) was so powerful that I have gone and ordered two of his albums. ([[ASIN:B000GB7DTE Requiem for a Dying Planet]] and [[ASIN:B0052T5TQ4 Cave of Forgotten Dreams]].)<br /><br />I was also motivated to look up books on the Chauvet Cave. It looks like most of them are out of print at this point. [[ASIN:0810932326 Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave (The Oldest Known Paintings in the World)]] in particular looked exciting, but the price is extreme at this point. Let's hope that the success of the film motivates the publisher to get these back into print.<br /><br />Noah Mullette-Gillman<br />Author of Luminous and Ominoush Mullette-Gillman  Author of Luminous and Ominous
B000AJIF4E|4.0|My blue heeler puppy managed to climb over the baby gate I had blocking the entrance to my office and pulled these headphones off my desk. I came home and found my headphones lying on the floor and him asleep next to them. At first glance there was nothing wrong with the headphones; they looked completely intact. Upon closer investigation I found that he had just about chewed clear through the coily cable, which was left literally hanging by a thread.<br /><br />I was upset at first but decided to test the headphones before losing my cool. I was amazed to find that they still worked, even in stereo. Of course, there was some static whenever I moved around with the headphones on, but the fact they still worked at all (including in stereo) after such abuse was a relief (for me and the puppy). I wrapped the damaged cable with electrical tape and now, besides cosmetic issues, the headphones work just as new.<br /><br />I would definitely buy another pair if need be...and douse them in dog repellent.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|I was taken kicking and screaming to the 2011 remake of the 1982 classic that I stumbled upon while being dragged to a mall by the wife years upon years ago. I hadnt heard or seen anything about the Carpenter film until I walked by the theater and saw the poster....with Mr. Carpenters name....and Russels..that intrigued me enough and I paid for admission for my then 6 year old son and I. We were both amazed and made another venture to again watch it on the big screen......got first a Betamax copy then a VHS copy then a DVD copy....fans doesnt quite describe us. On the big screen and small it was probably the most memorable movie for us during that entire decade...but most of that decade was spent watching very early Van Damme and Segal testosterone oozing films...anything with high body counts and cordite haze.<br />News of the \\"prequel\\" were heard and the grown son again accompanied me to the screening. The small town Wisconsin theater screwed up the final reel.....so I am literally being forced into purchasing the blu ray/DVD/Ulta-Violet (whatever the hell that is) copy on pre-order....I hope it is as the director wished it to be shown. I feared an \\"uber-chick\\" PC slant to this \\"prequel\\" and was happy to see that not being the case. Whenever the discs arrive I will be seeing the full movie for the first time.....the good news is that I now have a television the size of an efficiency apartment.<br />The majority of the movie seemed to be done very well...but the theater ruined the ending (ever tried asking for a refund? Doesnt work). So, I am going to put in my preorder so that I can finally watch all of the remake of Mr Carpenters work by a Director whose name immediately eludes one.<br />For now I am just going to sit here for a little while to see what happens....

B005N95JO0|5.0|The most recent version of \\"Some Girls\\" has all of the problems of Universal Music's most recent re-release on it. After listening to the bonus disc, you won't be mad at yourself for buying this great release for (for me, at least) the FIFTH time (The Original vinyl in 1978, with the original graphics, bought at Sam Goody's flagship store in Manhattan, near Times Square. The Cassette, twice, the first one destroyed by playing it on a cold morning in my vehicle at the time, and then the Virgin CD, which is the best rendering of this, the best of this era in the Stones long history!)<br />The best bonus track is from an unlikely source, Hank Williams, Sr. \\"You win Again\\" with an angry tone, the Country/Western legend would never have dreamed of taking. \\"Claudine\\", should have been on the original release, but somehow it also doesn't feel right on this album. On a later album, perhaps, but it sat too long. It makes the cut at last, deservedly so, too. \\"Keep up Blues\\" fit the album better than \\"Claudine\\", but there had to have been a lively debate as to whether it would go on the album or not. It lost out in 1978, and like \\"Claudine\\", it waited 33 years too long to be heard. \\"Tallahasse Lassie\\" sounds like it would have been on \\"Exile on Main Street\\", and did not \\"fit\\" \\"Some Girls\\". The audio quality of all but \\"Petrol Blues\\" makes me wonder why these recordings sound so much better than the album/CD proper. Universal should have done a comprehensive re-working of the album, and chose not to. That having been said, the bonus tracks make this a must buy for Stones junkies. Keep the Virgin CD in your deluxe edition and put Universal's lesser CD in your vehicle du jour provided it has a CD player ;-)!

006091307X|5.0|If author Thomas Pynchon lives a guarded life far from media scrutiny, never explaining himself or sharing interviews, then it should come as no surprise that his books do very much the same. The Crying of Lot 49 never tries to explain itself. This makes it, understandably, a frustrating read--until we begin to approach it on its own terms. This is a novel about meaning and how we find it in our world (particularly the radicalized 1960s world where this book originates from). Therefore, the structure of the novel and its anti-denouement tell us much about how this book understands meaning. This is not always comfortable. More on that later.    TCoL49 centers around a housewife protagonist, Oedipa Maas, who while acting as an executrix to an ex-boyfriend's estate discovers a potential underground postal system that directly and subversively competes with the official government postal system in what may be a conspiracy of grand proportions happening all around her. Yes, you read that right. This book employs dry humor, ambiguous meaning, chuckling sarcasm, insinuating character names, a play within a play, winding sentences, parody, and rich, dense language.    Pynchon does not fit nicely into any mold we have come to expect from a novelist. I am convinced that a great deal of our frustration with Pynchon stems from us uprooting him from that uncomfortable soil where he exists and non-indigenously trying to re-plant him in our own tame gardens. TCoL49 captures a 1960s America that is living in the midst of \\"storm systems of group suffering and need.\\" This is a world that is struggling with meaning amidst assassinations, the Cold War, nihilism, student demonstrations, and the civil rights battle.    In the middle of this social, philosophical, and religious turmoil, Oedipa Maas is positioned as a protagonist who searches after meaning. The result of this search is not some cheap, superficial nihilism, a world devoid of meaning. No, what is born from this book is a complicated relationship with meaning in our world, and what lies beneath. A pivotal scene has Oedipa looking into the contents of a transistor radio, and she is mesmorized upon finding the circuit board. \\"Though she knew even less about radios than about southern Californians, there were to both outward patterns a hieroglyphic sense of concealed meaning, of an intent to communicate. There had seemed no limit to what the printed circuit could have told her if she had tried to find out.\\"    Pynchon does not want to nullify meaning. He wants us to ponder and consider the circuit board of this world. This world has a \\"concealed meaning, of an intent to communicate.\\" Will we be able to discern its \\"heiroglyphics\\"?    This book's greatest achievement is that it has coordinated such density within but 200 pages. Like all great literature, there is a world to be discovered in these pages, and it will tell us much about our own. If most novels wade through knee-deep waters, this book is ocean deep in a world of non-swimmers. Most of all, though, this book is fun!    If you choose to read this book, spend time with it. Don't just consume it. Think it over. For a great university-level lecture of this book, see this site: [...]

0061743526|4.0|To Kill A Mockingbird written by Harper Lee and published by J. B. Lippincott is a southern drama novel that has captured many peoples hearts over the past 50 years. Scout Finch, a trouble making tomboy, narrates the story. She tells about her childhood with her Brother, Jem Finch, and the many negative influences during that time period. The story didn't have a very strong main plot, rather many different sub plots. These include the story of Boo Radley, a man who is judged to be insane and never leaves his house, and also their father, Atticus', court case of Tom Robinson, who is a black man accused of raping a young white girl.     To Kill A Mockingbird has many themes. One of these being the truth about social class. Social class is not always a good thing. It prevents many people from getting jobs, education, food, housing and more. Social class can be determined by race, age, sex, sexual orientation, and the simple factor of where you came from. In To Kill A Mockingbird Lee demonstrates the racism that took place in the 1930's that lead to Tom Robinson being accused of rape.  \\"There's something in our world that makes men lose their heads- they couldn't be fair if they tried. In our courts, when it's a white man's word against a black man's word, the white always wins. They're ugly, but these are the facts of life\\" (Lee 252). Atticus gives this speech to Jem and Scout in attempt to show them how much racism is not only in their town, but in their world. He says this trying to tell them that he most likely will not win the court case for Robinsion since in theory a white man always wins against a black man, despite how ridiculous the story the opposing side is preaching.  It also shows what isolation and loneliness can do to a person. It can often lead to depression, antisocial behavior, poor decision making, increase in stress levels, and other such things. If the loneliness has gone so far that you isolate yourself in your house, then people will think strangely of you. The novel shows several rumors against Boo Radley, such as the rumor that he peeks through peoples windows at night (Lee 9). This and other rumors cause Boo Radley to not come out of his house, which, of course, leads to more rumors about him. This is witnessed to be a cycle of rumors towards Radley which of course results in Radley isolating himself in his house which causes the cycle to repeat.    The novel shows the transitions that children go through from being innocent and unknowing to experiencing evil in the world and becoming adults. Everyone goes through these changes at some point during their childhood and this novel states it well. Scout was completely child like and unknowing at the beginning of the book until she experienced the evils of the world such as racism during Tom Robinson's case.   I found this book to be interesting due to the themes it demonstrates. The idea of transitioning from a child to adult,  the demonstration of racism, and the effects of isolation and lonliness was fairly interesting and extremely true. Although this book is fiction there were some key elements that made it almost seem realistic such as the themes I listed. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a book that is simple at one glance but once you dig deeper there is much more. Harper Lee did a wonderful job at creating this novel and the themes in it.  Once I finished the book I took time to think through all of the thought that the author put into it. It wasn't a novel like Harry Potter, exciting and adventurous, but it did have a lot of hidden meaning. There were times I would get bored of it, but there were key elements that seemed to catch my interest again. I am glad that I picked up this book.

0393338827|5.0|Reading this book creates a number of unrelated images in my mind.  The last hour of Apocalypse Now. Major Clipton's character at the end of Bridge on the River Kwai:  Madness.  Madness!  I'm sorry I got the Kindle version of this book as I wanted to throw it against a wall numerous times out of pure RAGE for what goes on in \\"Wall Street\\" (the place, not the movie) and the hubris, audacity, arrogance and infinite greed for a highly sophisticated rigged game that portrays itself as a legitimate business and the financial bedrock of this country.  I can now better understand Occupy Wall Street (at least its initial efforts).  I can understand how many foreigners can look down upon us in utter disgust as we hold up the Wall Street \\"titans\\" as business and thought leaders to be emulated, idolized and obscenely compensated. When, in fact, they are nothing more than The Kardashians of finance.  I guess that's a way of saying how utterly compelling this book is to a reader (who, in this case, has little knowledge of the ways of WS).  It's a brilliant mix of personalities, plot and recent history, all served up in a manner most palatable, if oftentimes hard to digest and rationalize.  The long reviews that have preceded this one have done an excellent job at describing the contents as well as the ups and downs of the book (for me there was a lot of repetition of some key plot points and supporting \\"dialogue\\" -- I get it already!)  So the purpose of this review is to urge you to read this brilliantly written book to better understand what goes on in lower Manhattan every workday and to, quoting yet another movie, be afraid, be very afraid.    I think the scariest, most worrisome thing in this book is to understand the power and stupidity of the ratings agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's (pretty good names for them, come to think of the irony), the companies that on the one hand allowed and abetted this financial crisis that continues today and has the audacity to downgrade US Treasuries and commit other acts that, while months and years late in the doing -- cost everyday Joe's like me a good chunk of my wealth as we're told, oops, it's not all that valuable after all.  They're just now waking up to that fact.  This book helps YOU and ME to wake up to these and other equally depressing facts.  One last movie reference:  Howard Beale, where are you? We need you.  We are mad as hell and we shouldn't have to take it any more. Who do we need to wake up to put and end to this too-real nightmare?  That's the book we should all read.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Tina Fey has the odd ability to come across as pretenious and full of herself while trying to do the exact opposite...she tries to be \\"down to earth\\" and prove how normal she is but it doesn't work. Her life is nothing like our lives. She talks about a time when she felt guilty for spending $7 on pizza and onion rings as it was equal to one hours pay at the time-well guess what, Tina, it still is for lot of Americans.   Also she writes with way too many exclamation points, something I personally cannot stand...but if you can, so be it.  She has a fairytale life. And she didn't come from hardship. So where is the story? I guess it is supposed to be the fact that she is a woman who made it big in comedy. Okay. But she is not the first, not by a long shot, so not sure why it is such a big deal.  I like her on 30 Rock, although getting tired of her cliched character there...but somehow like her less after reading this book.

1451627289|5.0|Stephen King has the ability to make you care about what happens to the characters he creates in his novels, that magical something that makes you want to curl up with a warm drink, a comfy chair and plenty of time to submerge yourself into the world he constructs.  With 11/22/63 King draws the reader into the story from the first few pages and holds you prisoner till you finish.<br /><br />Take note 11/22/63 is not a King horror story, rather a journey into the past to try and change history by saving JFK wrapped around a love story.<br /><br />Quick synopsis (others go into greater detail not worth rehashing here).<br /><br />In an old diner storeroom about to be torn down a portal exists enabling those who pass through to return to 1958 at exactly 11:58 A.M. on September ninth.  Each time the traveler passes through the portal it returns them to exactly the same time, same date, and resets the past to how it originally played out.  Jake Epping, alias George Amberson in 1958, travels back in time and resides there until 11/22/63 in order to try and alter history and save JFK.  Along the way he meets and falls in love with Sadie.  Living in the past Jake/George makes many choices and his actions or inactions, each one no matter how small, creates the possibility of altering history.<br /><br />It is quite obvious King, with the help of his friend Russ Dorr, did a tremendous amount of research on Lee H. Oswald and the controversy of a conspiracy along with elements of the time period for this novel.  King seamlessly weaves events leading up to the assassination with tidbits of the time period that drop you right into the time and place, 1958 through 1963.<br /><br />Small things such as, a root beer from a soda fountain is five cents or a large which is ten cents, comic books five cents or three for ten cents, Chevy's with fins and decked out in chrome, rotary phones with party lines, and cigarette smokers lighting up everywhere creating clouds of noxious smoke..  The descriptive atmosphere drew me right into the story, for a short time I was in 1958.<br /><br />The novel (hardcover) is long, 849 pages.  But if you are like me and enjoy Stephan King's prose you will just dig in and enjoy the ride.  There is a heartwarming ending that is so unlike his previous novels.  I felt the time spent reading 11/23/63 was well worthwhile.tory, for a short time I was in 1958.  The novel (hardcover) is long, 849 pages.

I've heard they didn't plan it, but the music works with the movie's scenes perfectly.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Rarely is a movie so smart, so funny, and so romantic as Midnight in Paris. A sumptuous feast for the eyes, the heart and the mind, it succeeds at doing so many things well that it is hard to find superlatives that do it justice.  I went into this movie fearing it would be the typical Woody Allen awkward romantic comedy that is painful for me to watch unfold. Instead, I found it captivating: visually, emotionally, and intellectually.  The plot works well on several different levels, and the interweaving of episodes from La Belle Epoque and Paris in the 1920's satisfied the romantic as well as the historian in me.  Geek Alert!  I liked this so much I actually contacted my long-retired college American Lit. professor and invited her to see it with my wife and I.  She enjoyed it so much we actually had to try and stifle our laughter because others around us were beginning to stare.  I would recommend seeing it on Blu-Ray and a large screen TV in order to fully appreciate the rich visuals in Paris.  If you only enjoy it half as much as I did, you will still be glad you saw it.
B00012L786|3.0|Not great film noir, but good enough -- and then some.  The outrageously underappreciated Richard Widmark lives up to expectations by doing an outstanding job. Jean Peters understands her character the way hand goes into glove. The always reliable Willis Bouchey doesn't disappoint (a favorite in our family because of his uncanny resemblance to my mother's Uncle Geza). Thelma Ritter (was there ever a time in her life when she didn't look 65?) gives one of her finest performances.  And a word about the fight scene between Widmark and Richard Kiley:  Among the best ever filmed.  It's up there with the hand-to-hand between Sean Connery and Robert Shaw in \\"From Russia with Love\\" and the three-way fisticuffs involving Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt, and Barton MacLane in \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\".   I must say, though, that I didn't buy the Widmark-Peters relationship. The kissing scenes were awkward, his massaging of her face weird and rather disturbing, and she falls in love with him literally from one second to the next.   All said and done:  Reservedly recommended.

0060873027|3.0|If you're a Michael Crichton fan, this book is certainly worth a read. It's not much beyond that though. The plot and characters are predictable and the events happen procedurally. There wasn't a single page that had my heart racing like previous Crichton or Preston books.
1451627289|5.0|I'm still immersed in this fabulous ride, but gotta tell you -- this book is worth every cent. I happen to have the audio version and that makes it even better, because the reader of this tome is providing an academy-award performance. He picks up the regional dialects to a tee, and makes these characters as real as your next door neighbor. He's got a lot to work with. Characters that are highly believable and knowable. Descriptive prose that transports you back to the 50's in all it's crew-cut and pony-tail glory -- being a 60's girl, I can tell you it's accurate. Leaves me yearning for a simpler time....or so it seems now.  Historically, it feels right. I haven't found any errors in assassination lore, although I've just \\"arrived\\" in Dallas. King certainly obsessed on getting the details right (except for one thing -- I don't think Marina Oswald got her teeth fixed until after the assassination.)Other than that, he's on the money.  I've never been a King fan, but I have a new respect for this man. The story (all of it) is well-researched and so damned believable. It's more than just a great story. King is a master of dialogue. Aside from feeling sleep-deprived for 4 days because I can't stop listening every night, I am so glad I purchased this one. I'll be sorry when it ends -- however it ends.

B002I0J5FG|5.0|I never had a PS2 so I missed out on both ICO and Shadow of the Colossus. Luckily for me, and all those who didn't have a PS2 or play the game back then, they have combined these two games in to an HD collection. When i booted up the game, I decided to play ICO first. The graphics were good and the sound was great. The story was a bit confusing at first as there is no background or much narrative throughout the entire game. I found myself beating this game fairly quickly, but enjoying it at the same time. There were some parts that were frustrating, but overall, it was a very well done game, I'd give it an 8.<br /><br />Next I played Shadow of the Colossus. And believe me, it lives up to the hype. I never really heard of this game growing up which is sad because I consider myself a pretty big gamer. It just goes to show how underrated this game truly is. The HD remake looks amazing. The gameplay is engaging, although there were times I wanted to throw the controller haha (why do those Colossi shake so much!?!). The story was pretty good. I did like the way the company took the game where you fight 16 giant bosses instead of needing to go through stupid little character along the way to get to the bosses. The scale of the Colossi are breathtaking. Never have I felt, as a character in a video game, so puny. However, I think the best part of this game is easily the music. The music fits the mood of the game perfectly, captures every sound, and is extremely powerful. Its sad that this game came out years ago and has much better, more powerful music than a lot of games today. I would easily give Shadow of the Colossus a 9.5.<br /><br />Overall, I've very happy with this purchase and suggest everyone who missed out on this before to buy it. Can't wait for the company's next game, The Last Guardian, to come out.
1451627289|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Absolutely his best so far. Loved the characters, time period descriptions and the plot complexity. Another great read, similar to 11-22-63, is James Wharton's Detour.[[ASIN:B0060OIY6C Detour]]
0316172324|1.0|This Book is worth nothing, not even the paper it is printed on.  The book is totally self-contradictory and the book contains useless facts and is much too verbose. A waste of time and money.
0443069522|4.0|This is a very readable text with gorgeous illustrations and uncluttered labeling. The text is very concise and easy to plough through even if you're short on time. It might not be sufficient for an anatomist or practicing surgeon, but for a med school student it's ideal. The online content is fantastic, with plenty of practice quizzes and reviews.  The downside to this book is that its \\"In the Clinic\\" green boxes often lack illustrations or figures that would help drive home the message. I hope that this deficiency will be improved in the next edition.  My med school recommended Moore's Clinically Oriented Anatomy 6th edition but I found it to be very poorly laid out, with messy and cluttered illustrations and page layout. For this reason I found Moore's to be awful to read, especially given that only a minuscule fraction of the content is required knowledge for med school students.  In the end I've stuck with Gray's as my main text and have only used Moore's for it's blue boxes that my lecturers sometimes like to quiz us on.
B000V86OKG|5.0|After watching the first 5 seasons of Dexter on DVD (all of which are fantastic!!!) this one sticks out in my mind as the best!!!  There are a lot of plot twists and suspense which makes it hard to stop watching.  In order of my favorite seasons this is number 1 followed by seasons one, five, four, then three.  I haven't seen any of season 6 yet, but after watching the 5th, it's bound to be a good one!  This is a must watch if you've only seen the first season!  You won't be disappointed with season 2!

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|It's rare nowadays to find a band that puts so much passion behind its music. But Mumford & Sons does just that. With lyrics so beautiful, relatable and strong, it's hard not to become attached to this London-based quartet. The band's debut album \\"Sign No More,\\" which was released in the U.K. in 2009, is full of emotion that will make you smile and come close to tears.  Guaranteed, the perfectly matched harmonies along with the beautiful lyrics will make you grin from ear to ear. The band's old-timey influence is enough to make you just want to sit back and listen intently to its rich, folk-rock sound that's filled with the unique sounds of a banjo, mandolin, upright bass, and yes, even an accordion.   The songs will take you back to the good ol' days of summertime, sitting on the front porch and drinking a glass of freshly poured lemonade all the way to a cold, rainy day just sitting and looking out your window. While many of the songs are uplifting and filled with great instrumentation, not all of them will make you want to twirl around in an open field with a carefree smile on your face. In songs such as \\"White Blank Page\\" and \\"Little Lion Man,\\" lead singer Marcus Mumford shares the relatable pain he has incorporated in heartbreakingly beautiful lyrics.  Perhaps what sets this band apart is its unique skill to pair the upmost amazing instrumentations with driven lyrics. However, don't expect to hear softly spoken and smooth vocals throughout the album. As Marcus drives emotion into the songs, the vocals quickly become rough and strong, which adds a completely new element to the album.   The group pairs subtle guitar melodies with beautifully placed piano chords and harmonies that eloquently turn into a hard-driven instrumentation by the end of many songs. The entire album flows seamlessly and, undoubtedly, is one of the most emotionally filled albums I've heard in a long time.  Admittedly, I just discovered this band a little over a week ago and, dare I confess,have probably listened to this album at least two dozen times.  Give this album a try and listen to it at least once. Within a week's time, it has already become one of my favorite albums!

B004KSQN7C|4.0|I think this has to be Britney's best effort, considering most of her other albums only have 1-3 good songs on them. This album you can listen to, in it's entirety! I was actually quite impressed with the production on this album, the sound of her voice, and the quality of music. I am, however, disappointed in the fact that she released the song \\"Criminal\\" as the latest single, considering there were many other better songs on there, especially \\"Trip to Your Heart\\", which I think would've shown the world an entirely different side of Britney, but hey, that's just my opinion!

B001TH8UUA|3.0|When I got this, I was happy with it. It worked almost perfect. The only flaw that I noticed is that sometimes the audio won't get to the other side of the cable (in my case a TV) and would play the audio from the laptop. You had to play around with it for around a couple minutes unpluging and repluging until the audio goes on the other side. Other than that it was greeeeat. I was happy with it, but it turned out to stop working after around 5 months. Through its lifetime, it worked well and I guess I didn't take too much care for it. But nonetheless it pretty much did great when it was alive.

B000AARKOO|5.0|Kingdom of Heaven is the quintessential epic film. It harkens back to many of the epic motion pictures of the '50s and'60s. Orlando Bloom, Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson provide solid performances. The costuming and the extras bring the age of the crusades to life. When the blacksmith of a remote town in France murders the local priest, he goes to the holy land with his estranged father in an attempt to secure forgiveness for himself and his departed wife. In his quest for forgiveness, he surpasses his station as a blacksmith and becomes a knight and the defender of Jerusalem. Anyone who appreciates epic films or recreations of history will enjoy this film.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|After reading the first book in the trilogy (Fifty Shades of Grey) I couldn't wait to read this book and it did not disappoint me. This book had so much happening and so many highs and lows that you should be prepared to take a lot of cold showers (or tackle your significant other often) and also have a box of tissues beside you to get through the heart-wrenching scenes.  This book gave us a deeper look into why Christian embraced the BDSM lifestyle and since meeting Ana made him question so many aspects of himself. It was amazing to see how the author was able to make the reader get into both Christian and Ana's mind and allow the reader to feel their passion (Wow they were scorching hot), love, anguish, despair and desperation. Not to give out any spoilers, but there were several eye-opening revelations that occurred in the book that left my mouth open in awe.  What more can I say without spoiling it. Christian and Ana continue to try and see if they can work through their differences, and it is not only internal issues at play, but external forces are at work as well. Fundamentally the story focuses on Christian's path to self-discovery, acceptance and learning about unconditional love. Christian has been in the dark for so long, but Ana manages to show him the light, not only around him and in their relationship, but within himself.  The author likes to include the title of songs throughout the two book and there were two songs that popped in my mind that reflect certain scenes in the book: \\"Don't Go\\" by KC and the Sunshine Band and \\"We Found Love\\" by Rhianna. Just the emotional impact of the scenes makes those songs stand out in my mind. As you can tell I became completely engrossed with this book and it was on my mind during my waking hours (and in my dreams too LOL) which is always a very good indication for me of a fantastically well written book.  I cannot stop gushing about this book (trilogy in fact as I can't wait to read Fifty Shades Freed - Book 3 outJanuary 2012) and about the author. If I could nominate best new author for 2011 I would nominate E.L. James and recommend her to everyone. So what are you waiting for? Grab yourself a piece of Fifty and be prepared for a wild and exciting ride.  5+++ Stars[[ASIN:B005N0PJJO Fifty Shades Darker]]
B00005JPD0|5.0|For fans of the new physics and its bizarre implications Deja Vu is a must see movie. During the investigation of terrorist attack, the movie's protagonist discovers that it's not only possible to view the past; it's also possible to go back to the past. His desire, not only to catch the terrorist, but to prevent him from committing his crime drives him to go back to the past and attempt to change it. The end has a most unusual twist on the whole idea of time travel paradoxes.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This is the first time I have read a book in this genre but after reading so many great reviews I couldn't resist and succumbed to the allure of Fifty Shades.  First I have to point out I was worried I would be disgusted by what I may encounter due to the nature of the genre, but I was extremely surprised. The book was not too gratuitous with the BDSM, but focused on the developing relationship between Christian and Ana and Christian's fetish was more of a backdrop into his personality. That said I had difficulty accepting the \\"need\\" to punish and hurt someone. I may understand the hows and whys (being a professional counsellor), but it is still difficult to accept.  This book really pulled me in tremendously because I found the emotional highs and lows so powerful that many times I had to fan myself because of how sensual and smouldering sexy Christian can be and crying at the heartaches. Many times I had to put the book down just to work through in my mind what had happened in the book. Seriously it left me sad and contemplating even when I wasn't reading it and trying to get into Christian's mind.  The author did a phenomenal job of creating characters with so much depth that they came alive and jumped off the pages. I found myself emotionally committed to both Christian and Ana and tried hard to understand them both.  As I continued to read the book I tried to understand Christian and why he would have turned towards the BDSM lifestyle and his need to control and punish. The one thing that popped out for me was how hollow he truly is inside with no real sense of purpose. This lifestyle somehow provided for him with a sense of purpose and completion while as the book progresses the opposite starts happening to him.  Ana, on the other hand, has come from a loving family with people who care for her unconditionally and where she has never been hit or had corporal punishment leashed on her. She feels complete, fulfilled and happy for the most part until she enters his world and tries to be part of it. As the story moves along you start to see changes in Ana as she starts feeling empty emotionally (yes the sex is mind-blowing), thus having an opposite effect upon her then what Christian thought it would.  It is never explained in detail, but the reader is aware that Cristian has endured some kind of childhood trauma where he doesn't want to be touched. He wants to control and has a need to punish that gives him a sexual high. It seems apparent that Christian grew up feeling he could couldn't please anyone emotionally and he was unworthy. It seems that in the BDSM world he learned he could please and be rewarded for pleasing to the point he wanted someone to please him. Somehow he developed the notions that hitting or punishing (and someone taking it) reinforces that the person wants to please him, in this case, Ana. Since Christian can't deal with emotional connections, the connections are reinforced in a physical way. Somehow it is almost as if he thinks if she can take it (physically not emotionally) he is worthy of attention and being wanted. Though as the story unfolds Christian starts to see glimmers of hope and possibilities as Ana tries to \\"bring him into the light\\".  One thing I agree with Ana is I also hate Mrs. Robinson because as Ana put the question out there \\"what would Christian have been like if he never met her\\". Christian's beliefs are contrary to Ana's and it is sometimes frustrating to see Christian justifying them to Ana. The book ends on a cliffhanger so make sure you have book 2 ready to read right after you finish this one.  One of the most mind-blowing books I have read in a long time that had me thinking about it even when I wasn't reading it!  5+++ Stars[[ASIN:B0052U59F4 Fifty Shades of Grey]]

B005B0QYMM|5.0|I don't write a lot of reviews. Only when i think a movie is either special or really bad will i write a review. Just wanted to say if your a fan of the first paranormal activity your going to love this movie. Has the perfect amount of build up and some great scares. The movie starts off like ghost hunters on the sci fi channel but ends the way you always want to see ghost hunters end. lol. Hope that makes sense. Nice to see some what of an original horror movie. I'm a big fan of these first person point of view horror movies and this one knocks it out of the ball park. Can't wait to see more from the 2 brothers that wrote and directed this movie.

B005HSG3U6|4.0|Some of the negative reviews are just off the mark. The cover is simple, lightweight and attractive. The elastic strap is a nice and simple solution for keeping the cover closed. The only drawback is the easel feature, which does work, but is not foolproof. The easel folds down if the Fire is on your lap, but it works well on a table top. The good news is that when you want to read or watch videos with the Fire on your lap, the felt surface is non-slip and you don't need the easel anyway. I am pleased with the purchase.
034552554X|5.0|I thought this book would be boring by the title, but I was wrong.  This book is about a girl who very slowly overcomes her orphan/foster child past.  Her one passion is flowers and she sends messages with them.  This book got a definite emotional response from me, and I wanted to reach in and help the girl with her problems.  Good read for anyone who likes a good coming-of-age novel.
0060873027|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I heard that Crichton only partially completed this novel before his death. But I wasn't disappointed in the least.The book was as good as any that Crichton had written in the past. It had breathtaking pacing, and I couldn't put the book down. I'm sure glad that I didn't go by the opinions of some of the other reviewers here on Amazon, since if I had I would have missed out on the best book I've read all year.Richard Preston managed to make his contribution to the completion of the book seamless, and you couldn't tell where his writing began in the book. My advice is to avoid the naysayers, and read this book. It's great!

B004AKCMD4|3.0|While there's not much new here in terms of a story (pretty much just two warring tribes), it is told with great visual and aural effect.  In particular the movie was made for 3-D which I didn't see unfortunately.  There is plenty going on in the subwoofers and surround speakers which is also nice.  Set in a fantasy world where air space is controlled by 2 sets of owls.  The bad guy owls aka, \\"the pure ones\\" are Nazi-like, capturing young owls, then brainwashing them into doing their evil deeds.  The good guy owls have dealt with this band before.  Thanks to two young owls who escape, the two sides re-engage with warfare.  The battle scenes are very good, although with a PG rating we don't see much of the good stuff.  Watch it for the technical aspects and some excellent voice work.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|Heard a review of this on NPR and thought I'd give it a go.  Unfortunately, I'd heard this story before - \\"Dr. Shrinker\\" on the Sid & Marty Kroft show when I was a kid.  The characters were completely 2 dimensional, never developed, and there seemed to be so many of them just so that they could keep getting killed off to keep the action going.  The \\"twist\\" in the plot was easy enough to figure out in the first 40 pages or so.  A complete waste of time, IMHO.  Definitely not worth $15.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed 11/22/63 by Stephen King. I did not live during that time period, so those years in history were really great to live through. And I did feel as if I lived them, reading this book. The characters were engaging and sympathetic, with real obsticals to over come. The descriptions were in such detail that I could smell the cigarette smoke and hear the music. And, in true King fashion, there are unusual connections and cause/effect - like changes to the past effecting the universe as well as the future and pawn shop owners with unccany similiarites. I saw tie-ins to King's Gunslinger series and other works (such as It) with similar connections. I love to see that in king's books, how other works and concepts are tied in to so many ways in so many places. It is a very long book and I sat and read it for one solid Saturday to the detriment of my house chores.   I took off one star, because I felt that much of the length was filled with needless fluff and repetative descriptions. As an example, during the first 100 pages, I'm thinking, boy people sure smoked a lot during the sixties, but by page 500 I was thinking - okay, okay, I get it already, they smoked a lot in the sixities! Do I really need to read about it over and over again? Or the dancing. Perhaps King likes to dance, or perhaps it had some huge significance to the book that I missed, but the times (multiple times) I had to read (in excrutiating detail) the dance scenes, I got bored, irritated, and finally skipped most of them.   It was a book I enjoyed. It was worth the $16 or so dollars I paid for the kindle version, and its something I'll recommend to others and read again myself. The annoying extras that I described above were minor distractions to my overall enjoyment of the book and might not irritate other readers as they did me. Read and enjoy!
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my 9 week old son, so he won't really be able to appreciate it or use it for a few weeks yet.

I bought it after seeing how much my youngest nephew loves his Lamaze dragonfly, and I'm sure my son will love this just as much.<br />Great toy!
B000AOEMXM|4.0|This is a long time coming, and I know there is already a ton of reviews for this series.  I just have to give my take on this series just too kind of cleanse my soul after watching it for the second time.<br /><br />Broken Bow was the start of the series, and it had a lot of promise and it gave me so much hope for the show.  Who wouldn't want to see the missions before the Original Trek Crew of Kirk and Spock?  In this episode we see the Klingons for the first time in the Trek universe and to any fan of Star Trek you immediately notice something that most casual fans might not.  So it starts to make you think about the possibilities of what could have happened.  It was a great time to be a Trek fan.<br /><br />Season One started out strong and for the most part was a great first step in building the Trek universe, That said Season  two was dragged down by time travel, too much was used to try and explain things.  It was unnecessary and a cheap way to explain things.  In my opinion it brought the show down and ruined what could have been an outstanding show.  The second season turns Enterprise into an acceptable TV drama that was to busy trying to confuse everyone.<br /><br />Season two brought more time travel into the mix with trying to expand the \\"Temporal Cold War\\".  Season one had the \\"Temporal Cold War\\" and if you didn't get it by the end of season one, season two and three throw it in your face every time they can.  It really cheapens the Trek universe and it reveals too much to Captain Archer.  Even with all the future information given to him you wonder why he makes some of the decisions he makes knowing full well what would happen if he just did it another way.  With the information given to Captain Archer about the Federation being formed you feel as if it deprives you and him of the experience of creating it.  There was no need for time travel in this show.  Season two was were a lot of the fans left the show on to better things.<br /><br />If Season two was not enough to make you turn it off, Season three was another good reason to do so.  As with season two and one the \\"Temporal Cold War\\" plays a big role with the Xindi learning of how Earth is going to destroy their home world from another faction of the Cold War feeding the Xindi lies.  This in an attempt to destroy humans so the other species manipulating the Xindi could eventually take over the known universe.  So you guessed it, more time travel and more nonsense.  The Season starts off with the Xindi sending a massive weapon of mass destruction to Earth which ends up killing 7 million people.  So humans and Enterprise has to go to \\"The Expanse\\" to find the Xindi and stop them from completing an even bigger weapon that would destroy Earth in one blow.  This Season also tries to strengthen a romance that you feel was developing slightly in the First and Second seasons.  The season ends with Enterprise being thrown back into time.  Once again you're left wondering if they will just let the \\"Cold War\\" die and get back to being Star Trek!!<br /><br />If you managed to stick with the show you're finally made it to the best part of what unfortunately became the last season of this show.  It started out weak with the whole time travel thing, but they finally stopped the nonsense with time travel and focused on what was important.  It got the series back on track, and featured more of the aliens we have come to know.  The first part started off with the Augments and even has a reference to the \\"Botany Bay\\" and \\"KHAN\\"!  The show also started to explain the Klingon disease that changed their appearance to what we saw in the Original Show with Kirk.  This Fourth season was what we craved the show to be from the start and it was delivering on so many levels only to destroy you in the finial episode.<br /><br />The last episode is what makes people cringe with fear when they watch this show.  They know what's coming.  I for one hated the last episode as it basically makes you feel the whole experience was a joke from the start.  Was it real are all fake?  The little joke they had going though the whole series about a chief which you never see until now makes you wonder was it all worth it.  The last episode cheapens what the whole cast had worked for and basically turned it into a half baked Star Trek \\"The Next Generation\\" episode.<br /><br />A few things could have been changed and this episode would have been great!  Change one would be get rid of the TNG cast and all references to TNG.  Let it be about Enterprise and not William Riker!  Don't kill off an awesome character that everyone agrees is one of the best in the show for no reason.  This was done just to make fans talk, and it was senseless, there was no point in the killing and it seemed so forced like it was a joke to the writers.  Lastly show the speech we all wanted to see.  Why was this never shown?  It was start of the federation, the speech that made it comes into being and nothing was shown.  If you took out all the worthless TNG crap they would have had plenty of time to show the speech.  Besides that it was an ok episode and I understood what they were trying to do, but it failed miserably. ( I really believe if you just take out the one death, everyone would be happy with this episode, it would not make it so hated like it is.  Still a bad episode but that one death thows it over the top of being bad).<br /><br />Besides the last episode and the clunky 2nd and 3rd season, this is a great show.  The fourth season really does hit a home run, and it's too bad they canceled it.  I hope they could do something in the future with Star Trek.  It's like something has been missing for so long from TV and it needs to come back in the \\"Original Time Line\\".  Maybe the first episode should try and fix the damage done to Enterprise with another holodeck recreation of the 'Real Events\\".  Having said how badly this show ends, I would still recommend this show to Trek Fans.  It's a great show and it was enjoyable to watch twice though.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I got the Blu-Ray and I am not blown away by the picture, but I am very happy.  I never really owned the real DVD set so(I bought my DVD's in Afghanistan, so what I really have is a Ripped version of the show. :-), I thought it was about time I buy the show in a proper format.<br /><br />First, I would like everyone to understand the reason why the first season of \\"Enterprise\\" is not up to picture quality like \\"The Original Star Trek\\" or \\"The Next Generation\\".  This is not a remaster of \\"Enterprise\\". This is simply a transfer of the original film to blu-ray disk.  I am not the only one to realize this, Blu-Ray.com does not really talk about this, but another review does.  Read the Digitalbits review it's very spot on!!<br /><br />The picture is an upgrade over the DVD's, but its not a huge upgrade.  If you are like me and have not bought the DVDs yet, than this is the set you want.  You will not be disappointed in the quality.  The first episode was the worse picture out the whole season, but it did get better along the way.  I believe this is due to the fact that the show was filmed when HD was still very young.  On the plus side it's the first Star Trek filmed in Widescreen.<br /><br />The sound is not great, but it is 5.1 and it's an upgrade over the DVD's. The best thing about \\"Enterprise\\" on blu-ray is the special features.  Words can not express the amount of extra's you get on this Blu-Ray.  The extras alone prove how much love CBS put into this Blu-Ray set.  If you think CBS is taking your money for a substandard blu-ray than the Special Features prove you wrong.  All of the DVD extras and even the Best Buy Extras are presented here, plus a few new ones that will blow you away on the amount of information given on why the show was not what it could have been.<br /><br />Overall the score for this release is a solid 8 out of 10 for me.  The picture could have been remastered, but I understand the reason why it was not. The picture was state of the art back in 2001 but today it does not hold up.  The sound is good but could have been great.  Despite the little problems \\"Enterprise\\" on blu-ray comes warping out of space dock onto your TV in a great package and is a overall great value.s a great show and it was enjoyable to watch twice though.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I got the Blu-Ray and I am not blown away by the picture, but I am very happy.  I never really owned the real DVD set so(I bought my DVD's in Afghanistan, so what I really have is a Ripped version of the show. :-), I thought it was about time I buy the show in a proper format.<br /><br />First, I would like everyone to understand the reason why the first season of \\"Enterprise\\" is not up to picture quality like \\"The Original Star Trek\\" or \\"The Next Generation\\".  This is not a remaster of \\"Enterprise\\". This is simply a transfer of the original film to blu-ray disk.  I am not the only one to realize this, Blu-Ray.com does not really talk about this, but another review does.  Read the Digitalbits review it's very spot on!!<br /><br />The picture is an upgrade over the DVD's, but its not a huge upgrade.  If you are like me and have not bought the DVDs yet, than this is the set you want.  You will not be disappointed in the quality.

B005HV6Y84|5.0|This is an excellent cd.  It is very mellow and beautiful. I can feel the emotions from the characters in each song.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|[[ASIN:B005JLN9ZI Take Care [Deluxe Edition]]]  This is a pretty good album. I'm not a big rap fan so drake is a good compromise because he sings and raps. It reminds me of the original drake reminiscent of his comeback season and room for improvement mix tapes. The only thing I don't like is that he cusses a little more than normal and I could live without some of the profanity in the songs, personal preference. Its great for driving, not too busy, all of his songs are chill. Also would have loved to hear Juvie the song Practice. Out of 10 i give it a solid 8.

B005SFR7YE|3.0|Just got in an import CD as a gift (both the DVD and CD won't be available in the US until 2012) and my favorite moment from the concert was cut from the CD - the Sarah Brightman 'Phantom of the Opera' -with the Phantoms from Around the World - was cut from the 'Grand Finale' number.  (Though ALW's long speech and 4 minutes+ of audience applause was left in  - shame!)  Hopefully this number will be present on the DVD/Blu release.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|I paid less than 10.00 on Black Friday, November 25, 2011. I had seen the movie earlier that summer, but I really wanted to own the DVD. I have seen all the Harry Potter movies, but I do not own any of the others - only this one. This, in my opinion, is the best Harry Potter movie of them all, combining all the darkness, plot-twists and revelations with a somber ending. Very pleased with this movie and will watch it many times over and over again.

0002247399|1.0|How could Martin's editors have let this go into print?  Was he to be paid no matter what drivel he put out.  Warning to anyone who hasn't read this yet - Go back and read the end of Feast and consider that the 'cliff hanger' end of Martin's career.  Martin put absolutely no thought into this story line (if you can even call it that).  There simply is no story.  I expected more from a person with such a loyal fan base.  It just goes to show you that some people simply don't care about their customers - so our only recourse is to give up on his future writings.  We have all been had...

B00127RAJY|5.0|So I did this workout after doing a different workout video a day before with a friend.  The ladies on the other workout video looked little fitness elves, dancing around so fast I could hardly figure out what I was supposed to do much less, actually do it. 30-day shred is great. I did level 1 yesterday and found it very easy to follow. I like that Jillian gets up and talks about form using the other leaders as examples. She gives you great tips so that you can maximize calorie burn and strength. It's like she's training you.  In 5 minutes Jillian answered why my knees got so sore when doing squats, and why my neck was strained during crunches. My personal trainer never mentioned anything to me. +1 to Jillian.  I have only completed level 1 and it was still challenging, which surprised me. I had to buy weights b/c I usually lift at the gym. I didn't want to spend a lot of money so I just got 3lb weights. Since I've lifted before, I thought it would be too easy. But she has you doing high reps and a lot of shoulder work, so I found that 3lbs was fine. Ladies, I would definitely start out with no weight or 1-2 lbs if you've never built up any muscle on your arms.    I am a 22-year-old female. I used to lift weights 5 times a week. Now I do cardio here and there. I feel that this video will give me a more structured workout goal.  TWO things I don't like about this video.  It doesn't tell you how many times to do the workout per week. This isn't a big deal except that you're doing the same workout everyday, and you really shouldn't do a lot of work on the same muscles, back to back. I know I need to take a day between workouts to do something different. The \\"recommendations\\" menu is basically a paragraph of text telling you about the levels. That's all the instruction you get.  I also don't like that there is no timer on the screen. It's nice to know you're almost done :) There is a notification when you get to the last circuit though.  Happy sweating :)

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I have been a faithful follower of Kelly Clarkson since her journey on American Idol more than a decade ago.  Over the past several years shes produced solid, upbeat pop hits and grand slam ballads.  But, my admiration for her as an artist definitely centers on her incredible, natural powerhouse vocals.  Shes really a gem!<br /><br />With \\"Stronger\\" Kelly just raises the bar even further.  She's back with some clean, fun and modern pop tracks which are sure to delight her older and younger fans.  Her vocals are just dynamite! Drawing more heavily on her country influences, we get to hear some new stylistic elements proving that Kelly can really do it all.  While I agree her absolute strength are the ballads, I am extremely glad this album is weighed more heavily on the upbeat side.  In particular, don't miss: What Doesn't Kill You, Einstein, Hello, Don't Be a Girl About It, Let Me Down, You Can't Win and Alone.<br /><br />This is a solid release from start to finish.  I have been waiting for new music from Kelly for ages and this album does not disappoint!  Highly recommended!

0802130208|4.0|Be warned you will not like this book if you need your \\"heroes\\" to be respectable, dignified or even worthy of admiration in any way. That's not the the point here: Reilly is a fat incompetent, and arrogant about it. So making him the heroic protagonist is rich in...pathos. If you can sympathise with the little man-at-sea, tossed and turned by fate, it's a joy.
B003XRELEI|1.0|You can tell a novel is by a liberal for liberals when it adds nothing, is odious to the extreme, and tries to be morally superior and morally relativistic at the same time.  I've seen more insight on cereal boxes.
B006FE17Q6|5.0|First off, what the hell is a \\"mid-season\\" finale?! What happened to actual season finales? Haha, moving on. Now episode 7 was a great way to leave an audience hungry for more. I started watching this show thinking, cool, a show about zombie apocalypse. The first episodes of season 1 were filled with some well done but very familiar material. As if Darabont (the show's director) was paying homage to the zombie movies that have preceded it. There was a scene more than just reminiscent of 28 Days Later but I don't hold this against the show as it was done so well. Anyway, season 2 seemed to have slowed down from the blistering pace of season 1 but I don't really consider it so much slowing down as it is more of lulling the characters into a comforting place before unleashing hell on them once again. After all, this show is not about shooting zombies in the head, but about human survival in a world turned upside down. It asks many questions of it's audience and of it's characters.  And watching the cast's varied, not mention well acted, reactions to the circumstances are the main part of what I enjoy so much about this show. The high production values come in second. For a television series not on HBO or Showtime the special effects are phenomenal.   That said Daryl rocks! He's my number one, not as bat-sh** hot-headed as Shane, and not nearly as sentimental as Rick. Good guy that Daryl. Rick is the leader for a reason though, as Shane demonstrates quite plainly at the end of episode 7. I think Shane is a deushe, and his 100% survivalist mentality will get him killed. He's a man of pure instinct which pretty much make him an animal living amongst men (and women). Not that people aren't animals but whatever.  But I digress, I'm looking forward to February 12 when season 2 starts up again, and I'm hoping the fan base continues to grow so smart television dramas like this one continue to strive.

B0053JJLLC|2.0|15 dollars for this? I am a Michael Crichton fan, and though I have not loved everything he has done, I have respected the work.  This novel was cheesy at best.  Felt like reading a sequel to \\"Honey, I shrunk the kids\\".

B0025UHKNS|5.0|Many people may not find me to be the expected type of customer for this watch.  I am not really interested in running, but do love hiking, climbing, and other outdoor sports.  Almost a year ago I purchased a Suunto Core watch to use for hiking and climbing, as it has an altimeter, barometer, and compass built in.  I had looked at the very expensive Suunto X10 instead, their GPS watch, but it had some poor reviews due to bad GPS reception so I went with the Core for $300 less.  When I saw this watch offered as a Deal, and noticed it was selling new on Amazon for over $100 less than on Garmin or eBay, I went ahead and purchased it.<br /><br />I am a commercial pilot as well, so I purchased it with the intent to wear it as an emergency backup instrument.  For this reason, there were a few key items I wanted to check that I could not find answers for online - it can measure speed over 100mph, which is very key if it will be used on an aircraft.  In fact, when acquiring satellites while riding in a car, it jumped to over 320mph for a second, showing me that is possible.  It is also very simple to set in a point that you want to navigate to, and it then will show you how far it is and the exact direction.<br /><br />Never before have I seen a GPS receiver that is so sensitive - I can sit on the ground floor of my 2-story house, right in the middle, and it will often find 6-8 satellites and show 25ft or better accuracy.  Even my large handheld hiking WAAS-capable GPS is not this sensitive, making this watch perfect for use in sports like running or biking.  Trees, clouds, and other items will rarely if ever block the signal.  The heart rate monitor appears to work well and was very easy to setup.  I love how this watch lets you customize up to 4 data screens with up to 3 data fields on each one, and it can auto scroll through them during your exercise.  I will admit, it may take the average person a little getting-used-to before the touch bezel is easy and quick, but it works great.  I recommend Medium sensitivity setting for that.  If I do start running with this watch, I will simply lock the bezel and let it auto scroll through the workout screens after hearing that sweat or rain can make it sensitive.  It was very simple to connect with my Mac and get it up to date, and this also automatically takes all data from the watch and puts it into the Garmin app on the computer so you can see maps, charts, everything it has recorded.<br /><br />This watch works exactly how I hoped it would and remains an excellent deal.  I highly recommend it to athletes who need a workout instrument.<br /><br />EDIT - I have decided to add more to this review.  Recently, this watch stopped receiving GPS signal from any satellites.  I performed a hard reset as well as a Garmin-suggested reset of the satellite data.  Neither solution fixed the problem, so I requested a repair from Garmin.  They were very fast to respond.  I sent the watch in and they sent a refurbished replacement out only one hour after my shipment was delivered to them.  I have never before experienced such a quick repair/replacement, so I am very happy with their customer service.  The new watch works great just how the older one did.  One other suggestion I have for anyone purchasing this watch is to be careful about the small rubber loop that holds the excess watch band down.  My former one started to split after a good deal of use, but this was mainly due to the fact that I would just force the watch band through it quickly all the time.  Now that I have a new one I am far more careful.
B005R2S3VE|3.0|While I have not seen this version of the DVD yet, the show has been floating around awhile as a \\"tradable commodity\\" both in audio and video format. The TV show itself runs about 85 minutes and this release runs only 50 according to the press release. Later that year they toured the U.S. and shows were 2+ hours long. Buyer be aware is all I'm saying.  As a watchable video it is classic Chicago prior to guitarist Terry Kath's passing so this is a nice piece of history nonetheless. It would have been nice to include the whole concert which, by the way, I believe is from Feb. 10, 1977 (someone correct me if I'm wrong).
0385535139|5.0|Lacks the snappy story line usually a given in John Grisham novels.  No jolt. No expansive character development.  Shallow.

1451627289|3.0|I had not read a Stephen King novel since the 90's. I used to LOVE his stuff. I still consider 'Salem's Lot to be perhaps the scariest novel I have ever read. That was in 1976 while I was working my way through college as a night shift security guard in a deserted -at night, anyway - junkyard. Try reading that book in a small booth with dim lighting in pretty much complete isolation and silence. I loved it. Loved \\"The Shining\\", too. And \\"The Stand\\" (my favorite King work) was brilliant. I faithfully read everything he wrote until...I don't know...I kind of lost interest in King's particular genre. Again, that was in the 90's.  But the Kennedy assassination has always held a certain fascination for me. Throw in a good time travel story and I'm in. So I bought the book. Hello again, Stephen King.  Goodbye again, Stephen King.   But I must say, he had me at first, big-time. The rabbit hole in the diner (hey, time travel is a crazy concept, so you may as well come up with a crazy way of doing it...no problem). The stopping of Frank Dunning from his dirty deed...enjoyed it thoroughly. And King did indeed bring that period alive for me again. I was a child during the 1958-1963 backdrop and King nailed it. Very well done. Also well done was King's covering the bases on the \\"time travel to the past\\" paradoxes.   Maybe it's just me but he started losing me with Jake stalking Oswald prior to the General Walker assassination attempt. And then I remembered why I stopped reading King in the 90's. He gets WAYYYY too wordy. Yes, I fully understand what he was trying to do with the story at this juncture. But come on, Stephen. This novel could have been shaved by 200 pages and not missed a single point. Damn it, don't grab me as reader and then suddenly let me go in the middle of the book. He gets a D for editing...or at least the editor does.  Another aspect that was really hard to swallow was the dialogue between the characters. Again it's been a long time since I've read King material. Was it always this painfully contrived...to the point where I started to feel embarrassment for SK? I don't remember it being so bad. The only reason I finished the book was to see the changes in history if JFK lived. George Wallace was our President! And there were massive earthquakes! Nukes were flying! And King wrote this drivel with a straight face? Good Lord.  Anyway, if you like McDonald's food you probably like Stephen King novels. Fair enough. I used to like Stephen King. Big Macs, too.
0743454537|5.0|My Sister's Keeper was an astounding book; it starts off when Anna goes to a pawn shop to sell her beloved locket that her father gave her when she was a child. Later on she goes home feeling ignored and unloved while her mother pours all of her attention onto her sister, Kate, who has a very rare cancer. No longer wishing to do the duty she was born to go, Anna goes on to sue her parents so she can no longer donate her organs and blood to her Kate. This book is about the difficulties of Anna, her family, and everyone around her as Anna tries to determine whether or not she really wants to sue her family. Second guessing herself, trusting others to make choices for her, and through lies we, the reader, never know until the trial begins. While in court we start to finally understand the choices that everybody has made and why they did it. Reading this book was the most confusing, yet enlightening book I have ever read. Since the chapters were done with a different character's perspective, while reading their words and analogies it made have a deeper understanding of the story and made me unable to put down the book. The only bummer was the ending, I did not expect for that to happen at all and really want this to be one of those cliché \\"happily ever after\\" books. Instead I was at a lost for words with tears running down my cheek. Maybe this is what the author intended but over all this book was amazing. It is a must read for those who love suspenseful stories that makes you hope that the end never comes.
B004ISVH7U|5.0|I bought this set for the Harmony Game, having the other songs already. My daughter just discovered this group and stole many of my CD's. : ) I enjoyed seeing Paul and Art talk about making the album, the work that went into each song, the amazing effort of recording \\"The Boxer\\" for instance was facinating. If you love Simon and Garfunkel this DVD is priceless.  And who can tire of Bridge over Troubled Water?   I have the \\"Concert in Central Park\\"  on my daughter's Christmas list and will enjoy watching it through \\"new eyes\\". Both items are a must-have for Simon and Garfunkel fans.
B003Y5H53S|1.0|THIS IS NOT A KID'S MOVIE, AND IT DOES INDEED CONTAIN MATERIAL THAT IS OBJECTIONABLE FOR CHILDREN!!  I honestly don't know what is wrong with the people's heads that made this film. Do they have a desire to desensitize people? Did they want to bore us out of our minds? Did they want us to wear out the fast forward button on the remote? Did they want to make money at the expense of everything else (pun intended)?   I must admit, as soon as I saw in the trailers that it wasn't from Pixar, and furthermore, that the main character was voiced by Johnny Depp (who in real life is alternately weird, crass, gross, or all three at once) I immediately crossed it off my list of things I would watch. That was until my parents (on my sister's questioning) decided to rent it (free, I might add; I'm glad we didn't pay for it) to see if it was any good. I forced myself, over my better judgement, to be optimistic about this trashy excuse for a kid's movie. I soon discovered I shouldn't have.  In the opening monologue, the first thing my parents said was \\"I can't believe this is in a kid's movie\\" or something to that effect. I couldn't have agreed more.  To make a long story short, I will provide a list of my grievances (not in order of importance):  1. It being included with kid's movies. THIS IS NOT A KID'S MOVIE, AND IT DOES INDEED CONTAIN MATERIAL THAT IS OBJECTIONABLE FOR CHILDREN!!  2. The frequent use of euphemisms (to which most society seems to be desensitized, and now seem to part of family tradition).  3. The not-subtle and totally purposeless (save for indoctrination and desensitizing) inclusion of perversion (The Traveling Troupe).  4. The lack of humor. I could count on one hand the funny parts in this trashy excuse for a film  5. Just bizarre.  OK. I am usually ok with bizarre humor, if it has a plot, but this had hardly any plot or humor, and the bizarre stuff was way out in left field, even for me.  6. The crass humor THAT IS RIFE in 99.9% of non-Pixar movies such asDespicable Me, Over the Hedge, Madagascar, Ice Age, Shrek, etc. I AM SICK AND TIRED OF IT! This trash was no exception.  As far as the animation was concerned it was ok, but nothing to write home about. I mean, what good does good animation do if the movie stinks? I didn't think the animation was any better than any other recent animated movie I've seen, and certainly wasn't good enough to warrant the slobbering adulation of the masses.   If there were one thing that I could say to those who haven't seen this movie is DON'T BUY IT OR SEE IT. I repeat: THIS IS NOT A KID'S MOVIE, AND IT DOES INDEED CONTAIN MATERIAL THAT IS OBJECTIONABLE FOR CHILDREN!!

0307593312|5.0|I'm surprised there are Murakami fans out there who seem a little disappointed by this giant, fantastical work. I absolutely loved it - right up there with Kafka on the Shore. Indeed, I found it a much more enjoyable read than The Wind-up Bird Chronicles, which was enjoyable enough in itself. Murakami admits to his writing having been influenced from by my own personal favourite Japanese writer, Yukio Mishima. And I think that shows in this tale, with Murakami (more than ever) focusing on his main characters foibles in very great depth - their thoughts (confused as they become), deeds (dubious to say the least) and morals (also, dubious to say the least). Wonderfully entertaining. Particularly enjoyable was taking a short breather with a different book altogether once having read Book One, and then returning to the fray of his crazy world - or worlds! Highly recommend it.

1452101248|5.0|I cook daily for a vegetarian household and use a fair number of cookbooks to keep things interesting (Greens, Moosewood, etc.).  When a friend gave us \\"Plenty\\" recently as a gift, I was a little blase about it at first--just another cookbook.  But, wow, this one is really something different.  With heavy emphasis on herbs and spices, this collection of recipes kicks vegetables up to a much higher level.  I'm working my way through it slowly (there are a lot of requests for repeats) and so far have tried the green couscous (herbs on steroids); cauliflower frittata (you won't go back to mac and cheese); black pepper tofu (unbelievably good), mushroom and herb polenta (the best polenta dish I've ever had) and the ultimate mushroom lasagna.  And a huge bonus--most of the dishes that I've tried so far are relatively QUICK and EASY to prepare.<br /><br />The overall accent for the food in this book is Middle Eastern, with an emphasis on fresh everything, especially herbs.  It does not include much for dessert, but I like that the focus is on main dishes.  The photography/illustrations are lush and the food actually turns out pretty much as pictured.  This is an unusually well written cookbook that actually adds something to vegetarian cooking.  I just bought three more copies to send to friends for Christmas--it's that good!  Highly recommended.

B005CKPQHA|5.0|I started watching Season 1 a few months ago.  At first, I only got through the first 15 minutes of the Episode 1, struggling with the idea that a high school chemistry teacher would decide to cook meth.  It's a difficult premise to swallow, but I eventually came back to the episode a couple of weeks later to watch the end of the episode.  I still wasn't sure I could buy into it, however, after about the fourth episode, I was hooked.  The characters are convincing and believable.  The whole thing unfolds like a Greek Tragedy, and the main character, Walter White, relies on what he perceives as logic and rationale only to slip deeper down a rabbit hole that he can't seem to escape from.<br /><br />While there are some minor hiccups or problems within the storyline, the viewer gets so immersed into the dynamics between the characters, particularly between Walter White and Jessie Pinkman, that the storyline's integrity becomes less important than the internal struggles of the characters themselves.  The arc of the story is a train wreck unfolding before the viewer's eyes - you know this has to end and it's not going to end well, so the focus is shifted to introspection as demonstrated with the back stories.  The viewer isn't wondering so much how it will end, but how or why things happened the way they did.  The writing is terrific, the acting superb, beautiful cinematography, and gripping topics that leave you grappling with your own sense of morality.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Got hooked on the second season of the Walking Dead and needed to get the first season.  Couldn't stop watching it!  Great show, just bummed that I need to wait until February for the next episode in season 2.
0316098329|2.0|I read this book as part of our All-Church Read. The topic is fascinating but I found the delivery of the story less than satisfying for a number of reasons. The most obvious is that the author doesn't appear to know what the \\"voice\\" of a five year old child is like. The story is told through the child's eyes and words, but the child is a surprising blend of very advanced (can already read) and weird in his use of language. His mother, the only person with whom he's come into contact -- besides regular TV watching that she monitors for appropriateness, speaks very well and there is simply no way this child would have so many speaking idiosyncrasies. In fact, the mother corrects his language rather frequently but -- for some inexplicable reason -- totally ignores some of the strangest word usages of her son. I'm very adept at \\"suspending my disbelief,\\" but this beggars my ability to accept that the author understands a young child. If she doesn't understand a young child, can I then believe the rest of her story-telling for any kinds of accuracy? The story is about a young woman who is kidnapped at age 20 and held captive for seven years. She has a child during that time and she raises him in the Room. It seemed as though Donoghue would have -- should have -- researched what people living through that would be experiencing and how they would be affected. If she can't get the speaking habits of a five year boy right, though, what else isn't accurate? Just disappointing to me.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|My SIL was very pleased with this present. She didn't wait for Christmas to open it but enjoyed it immediately. Thanks for the great service!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I often find myself playing multiple games while sitting around and waiting for appointments. It's easy to play, and fairly intuitive.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I was a bit leery to puchase this after reading some of the reviews, but the good reviews won me over. Its a beautiful cover!  I only wish I could find one as nice for my ipad2. The fit is perfect and the leather feel is amazing. Highly recommend this product.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Yesterday I have brought all my family to watch \\"Puss in Boots\\". I do not want to spend your time describing how great was the movie plot, voices and music. The movie is a great fun for kids of all ages. Adults in my family liked the movie very much too. We were singing the movie's melody together while walking to our car on the parking lot after the movie show. I'm giving the movie 5 out of 5 stars. The movie would be a good entertainment for gests with kids during winter holidays.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a nice game for those of us who need a break from three card draw. The ads get a little tiring sometimes, but it's a free game so I just ignore them.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Works great on the GTablet.  Multiple sets of tiles keeps the games interesting.  Awards challenge you to do better each screen to earn awards.
0307949508|2.0|I read the first one and liked it a lot. Can't wait for the movie! This one just did not do it for me. I got about halfway through and never picked it up again. I was surprised by my lack of interest since so many told me this one was even better than the first one. Maybe that was because they did not like all the gruesome stuff in the first one?
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Absolutely fantastic album.  This is my third Lady A album and I like this one the best.  Don't know how they do it.  Keep them coming!
1451627289|5.0|I guess I am one of Stephen King's \\"constant readers\\" as I've read everything he's ever written and loved a higher percentage of his work than any other author I can name.  I am not however a King fanboy that just loves whatever he writes.  11/22/63 is the best >>story<< King has written in a long time. It's got an undeniable hook in that anyone my age did see it as a watershed event, so it is quite a grabber as a topic.(Yes I remember where I was when Kennedy was shot...also where I was  when Bill Mazeroski won the 1960 World Series that George bet on!)   But the part that I particularly enjoyed was that it was not about \\"mind-bending paradoxes of time-travel\\". Thank you, Stephen, for that. You kept it simple. It was a love story with a lot of unusual context, I'd guess I'd call it. But most important of all as SK has said many times, \\"It's all about the story!\\" I loved the story and the characters, especially Sadie.  I read a lot....mysteries, biographies and what I might call fantasy/mystery like Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden stuff. In many so-called page turners, you fly by a lot of the text paying light attention on the way to the exciting conclusion. 11/22/63 is almost the reverse...I found myself wishing it was longer as I was reading it. It was an engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable >>story<<.  I saw the unavoidable references to \\"IT\\" and the clown Pennywise and Derry of course, but I didn't feel like I had to call upon my two readings of the Dark Tower series recited backwards and a decoder ring to enjoy this story thoroughly.  Stephen, this constant reader will remain so as long as you are kind enough to share your story-telling ways with us. The really good ones are old-timers, so you may just be coming into your prime! Look out, readers!
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing this here. But on sale for $18.99, I felt it was a good bargain on a Blu Ray I just had to have for the grandkids, to add to the Potter Collection we already have. The movie is five stars. The picture on Blu Ray is out of this world. Truly phenomenal movie and wonderful ending !  The marketing at Amazon should be up front with people when presenting \\"ultraviolet digital copy\\".  Who knew you had to pay to view it??  That was deceitful and wrong.  Glad I have the movie, but not happy about Amazon's marketing of this otherwise five-star product.
B006FTCH2E|5.0|The folks who gave this a negative review were looking for something more Hollywood and less intelligent, perhaps... This was one of the most moving and provocative films I've seen in a long time. Rent Avatar again if you just want to escape and don't want to think. If you can handle a thought-provoking and emotionally sensitive story, you will most likely appreciate this fine film.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I was never really part of the 'Matrix cult' but I found this for $25 on a Gold Box Special. Since I love to add classics to my BR Collection, I picked it up and decided to watch the first Matrix in Blu-Ray.  Suffice it to say, a couple of days later, I've been glued to the 50-inch plasma, gone through all three films and most of the documentaries.  If you are a fan, it is a MUST HAVE collection.  If you're not a fan, you certainly will be after you are swept up into this Trilogy of stunning special effects and dazzling action. Enjoy !
B00386EZJU|5.0|This is the best soundtrack of all time, but you probably already know that from having seen the movie. (What? You haven't seen it? Go out and see it now!!). Buy it, you won't regret it.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I rented this while on a bored on a business trip, for a ridiculous amount of money, via my hotel entertainment system. I didn't regret a penny spent. For me, it's the best one yet. Enjoyed it so much I was thrilled to get it on sale at Amazon during the Black Friday craziness. It plays fine in my PS3.  I wasn't expecting Oscar material.. it's an adaptation of a comic book for goodness sakes. But I give it high marks for entertainment value and looking VERY pretty on a big screen plasma set ! Ten dollars well spent, IMO.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|The right side stereo doesn't work after a minute of the headset being on.  Is it something i'm doing or is this unit defective.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app, always have this running in the background and the weather readings are always accurate and detailed, highly recommended.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|It hard to find a watch with a band large enough for an American.  (I don't think my wrist is large at all, but those Timex watches in WalMart come with little bands.)  This one fits and is adjustable up or down.  Get the band adjuster, too, so you can adjust the size.  Fits comfortably.  And the watch works too!
B005K17RU0|5.0|love it.  works great.  gives me the info I want for the locations I want quick and easy!!!!  very User friendly.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I read my first Stephen King novel, Firestarter, in 1980. I've since read all of King's novels, and most of his short stories; I am one of the many Constant Readers, and my library shelves sag under the weight of his many hardcover books.  Stephen King: You either love him or you don't. I do, my wife not so much. The Stand, Talisman, The Dark Tower series, Needful Things, The Dead Zone, and Pet Semetary are among my favorites; Under The Dome and Duma Key not so much.  I was haunted by the 4 novellas in Full Dark, No Stars, which I feel is King's best in years...which leads me to 11/22/63, which I finished reading today.  11/22/63 is among Stephen King's best ever, and after 40+ years at his craft, it is a gift not only to his faithful fans, but one of the best American novels period. Steve has created an incredible time-travel story filled with some of his best dialogue and fully-formed characters.  We've met \\"other\\" King characters named Jake and George over the many years, but when was the last time King focused on love and romance among the tragedies and horrors all of us have witnessed over our lives?    11/22/63 qualifies as a MUST READ and is one of the very best novels I have read in years.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|I bought this Blu-ray movie based on the reviews of the cinematography  and indeed, it is breathtaking. I was not expecting a wonderful story. I was taken aback by the actor's ability to portray the pain of depression, and the difficulty of dealing with suicidal ideation. The young girl's unconditional love for this man and the purity of her intentions ultimately lead to his \\"salvation\\". The conversational rapport is fantastic- this little one is a gem!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Pretty detailed even if actions are a little clumsy on my kindle fire but still effective regardless. A must have for all aneroid users.
0060873027|2.0|What a shame this will be Crichton final novel; and, that is the only reason to read it. Characters the size of my thumb nail are not really micro. The novel was more like a return to \\"Land of the Giants\\".
B00005JMYI|5.0|Required viewing for anyone who has not seen this and is under 30. I bought a used version of the DVD and was really pleased with the outcome. The first version was scratched, and Amazon gladly provided a new used version which was, thankfully, not scratched.  As for the movie, obviously awesome, as well as the source of many costumes for parties throughout the years.  Now if only Amazon sold sex panther.
0307477479|3.0|For those who are intrigued by the puzzle nature of \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad,\\" by the interconnections among the characters and the leaping around in time, I recommend another novel that demonstrates these characteristics in spades: \\"The Sound and the Fury,\\" by William Faulkner. The puzzle of Goon Squad is EASY to work out by comparison. It took me two complete readings of the Faulkner to \\"get\\" it. But strangely enough, it was rewarding to read it the second time and enjoy the many Aha! moments as characters and events fell into place and began to make sense.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I love this movie! I felt like this was the year my two sons were really ready to watch it and enjoy. I was right! They love it.  It is so special in my house, because I grew up reading the book every Christmas.  This movie is amazing! Watch it!
B003Y5H57E|5.0|This movie is simply amazing. I'm a Ryan Gosling ran, but would recommend it to anyone. A truly great story!

B0068TJLSY|1.0|This was so bad! We walked out of it. It tries to capture that whole Spielburgesque feeling, you know, with kids on the bikes in a suburb looking for adventure, but fails completely. What plays out is extremely tedious. It's nothing more than a B monster movie with every character a boring stereotype.
B004RUF9DC|1.0|This film has a terrible picture; very grainy. Dang I should've read the reviews. I'm also sending a request for a refund because this item was not as described.  I hope they come out with a real bluray version of this film!<br /><br />EDIT, vender denied refund and said it was my problem.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARe.. you are better off getting vhs.
B004DK49DW|5.0|This album has what I've come to know as the \\"golden sound\\", in that the tones are easy to listen to over and over again, the songs put you in a good mood, and the lyrics make a hell of a lot of sense.  As i approach 30 years of age and find myself having been a true fan of all things punk for half my life, i've found myself at many a punk show of late saying to myself \\"what's the f***ing rush? nobody's going anywhere, slow it down\\". Social D must have had the same sentiment.   Listen, this album is certainly slower than all of their previous releases. But that doesn't take away from the goodness of it.  Mike's words are very easy to relate to and hold on to, sometimes they hit so close to home that i get a little teary eyed or goosebumped, and for me, that's the way music should be. Slowed down does not equal boring or wimpy, it's just slower. If you want the double bass furious guitars metal sound go listen to Avenged Sevenfold. If you want the speed they used to have, go listen to Sociald D's old albums. Some people seem to forget that you can always listen to an old album if you miss the old sound.   I will say that there is nothing ground breaking in the song writing. It's pretty much 4 chords at play, and it sounds a lot like the Black Crowes. But the approach, delivery, and lyrics couldn't be more on point.  If you find yourself getting older and tired of listening to the same rehashed crap over and over, get this album. With some patience i promise you will love it. If you don't, you're either too young to understand or just don't like rock music.
1466208686|5.0|You can read other reviews to get a good sense of \\"what\\" is covered in this book and \\"how\\" well it is covered, so the question I wanted to answer with my review is \\"when\\" should you get this book?  Whether you are searching for a job or not, my answer is now.  I picked up this book while in what seemed like a good steady job and my primary interest was not to prepare for a job interview but rather to have some fun and challenge myself by working through the excellent programming questions. Things change however and that once steady job started getting progressively worse which ultimately made me decide it was time to move on. I'm especially glad therefore that I picked up this book - after taking a few months off, I'm ready to start the job hunt and I know I can walk in to any interview feeling confident I can tackle whatever comes my way.  If you are already in a steady job and happy, get this book to challenge your mind and improve your programming and logic skills. And with life and the job market being as unpredictable as it is, you might find you will need it sooner than you think!
0446573019|4.0|Zero Day was an enjoyable read if you like this genre, which I do.  What struck me as strange, and then almost unbelievable, were the similarities to Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels.  I feel like Baldacci stole the character because the similarities are uncanny - both 6'-5\\"+, army cops/investigators,same names, both have internal clocks, military families, tougher than everyone else, and the list goes on and on.  That said, I love Reacher novels, so I enjoyed this one.  Baldacci should do the right thing, though, and give Lee Child a piece of the profits.
B005YDLJ76|4.0|I'll get the basics out of the way now; this is a short concert, as all of the pre-4 songs are shortened [the Destiny's Child era tracks get the most severe cuts - the backing singers and audience do the majority of the singing]. As the concert is short, there are no costume changes and no fancy stage setups, and although there is dancing, there wasn't much space to perform and Beyonce was already pregnant, so there is less then is usual at a Beyonce concert.<br /><br />It wasn't a problem for me, but some people may not like, is that various footage of Beyonce is inserted throughout the songs. Again, this wasn't an issue for me, but if you want to simply sit back and watch Beyonce sing, this isn't the best DVD to get.<br /><br />***<br /><br />This Beyonce performing live, so yeah, I'll call this a must own, but I'll admit that I had a few niggles, so it isn't perfect for me:<br /><br />The run of concerts at Roseland was to celebrate the 4 album, so it was disappointing to find that Beyonce only sings four non-singles from the 4 album; I Care, I Miss You, Rather Die Young and I Was Here [End Of Time is going to be a single]. I love I Care and I Miss You, but would have adored to see her perform Start Over live.<br /><br />I do really like the single Party, but it doesn't have the same spark to it without the Andre 3000/J Cole rap in it.<br /><br />As I already mentioned, this is a short concert and the earlier songs all get shortened considerably.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Now for the highlights;<br /><br />I never really liked 1 + 1 and I Was Here before now, but her live performances have sold me.<br /><br />I Care and I Miss You are two of my favourite songs on the 4 album and her vocals on the live versions are out of this world.<br /><br />I think that the music videos made for her 4 singles are her best and they're all [except End Of Time - maybe it's not been filmed yet?] on the second disc. All the way from the epic choreography in Run The World (Girls), to the just-been-released Dance For You - which is jaw droppingly smoking and has left me rethinking my heterosexuality...rosexuality...
B005NF2UE6|5.0|Okay so, people either hate or love Nickelback. I am one of those people who loves them, I am a diehard fan. I have all of their C.D's and I am continually impressed with what they put out. When they put out Dark Horse back in 2008 I could honestly say that I liked every single song, which is hard for me to say about any artists. So, I was very excited to here they were putting out a new album. I continually heard \\"When we stand together\\" on the radio and instantly knew it was them. For the hardcore, fist-pumping band they are, it is always nice to hear a down to earth song that we can all relate to and just mellow out to. I don't know why people critize that song, they have the right to write a song that speaks for peace. It brought tears to my eyes. But anyways, to the rest of the album. I bought this a few days ago and I can again say Nickelback has impressed me and I like every single song. As many other reviewers have said, they continue to stay true and write songs that can appeal to everyone. They have hardcore, guitar solo, fist-pumping songs like \\"This means War,\\" fun, drinking rock and roll songs like \\"Bottoms Ups\\" and deeper songs such as \\"When we stand together.\\" Many people think they are sell outs but they continue to write their own songs unlike other artists so, I respect this about them. If you want an album that pumps you up (would be great to take to the gym to work out to), to play at a party, or just want a C.D. to rock to, I would suggest buying this one. You will not be disappointed in this C.D. If you loved Dark Horse, you will appreciate this C.D. as well.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|They are still putting ads in these apps!  What's worse, now that I've uninstalled it, Amazon won't remove it from my list, a constant reminder that I should never have downloaded this app.
B004SBX112|3.0|NOt the best Angry Birds version but still fun. I love the Winter scenes. If you like this game try out Magnet Racer Arcade too.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This app was OK but the paid version still has ads, just in different forms. What's worse, now that I've uninstalled it, Amazon won't remove it from my list, a constant reminder that I should never have downloaded this app.
B004T6IBNY|4.0|This game is your average pinball game. We all love em, how could you not. There is another kind of pinball game on here called Magnet Racer Arcade that is a little more interactive. You can even make your own levels. That's one feature I wish Pinball Deluxe has.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|So I unimstalled it.  However, now that I've uninstalled it, Amazon won't remove it from my list, a constant reminder that I should never have downloaded this app.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Definitely better without Ads. Same good physics you would expect from Angry Birds. If you like this game, try out Magnet Racer Arcade too.
B005NS0VNU|4.0|This is a great compilation. A 99% list songs, obviously everybody have his own song to remain for example: Bang & Blame. Anyway, I recommended, if you are a R.E.M you have to buy it!

She sings with such grace,poise,and elegence that this generation needs to see and hear.<br />The dvd is wonderful,Adele is such a natural-born performer with such a talent that deserves to be reconized.During this dvd you get see Adele is some of her daily life,her cute dog,and of course her concert!<br />Wonderful! Get it! Better yet,buy 2!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics and fun. It is pretty easy to get into. If you like this you may also like Magnet Racer Arcade. It's a little more challenging than cut the rope but fun in that you can make your own levels.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I. call this my electronic brain software.  I am not exaggerating when I say Evermore is as essential to me as my web browser and office apps.  This software succeeds in bringing information full circle to your fingertips unlike any others I have tried (notably Onenote and Info Select) .  Armed with this and a scanner you will be as close to going paperless as you can be yet. The desktop version completely rocks.  The Android version is simple, well thought out and concise.  Just do it You will love it.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Born this way is her best album yet with amazing hit singles like: Born this way, Judas, Edge of Glory, You and I, and Marry the night. Every song in the album is unique with a different feel. Her songs pack so much emotion and feeling. This album is legendary and will surely go down in the record books as one of the best albums of all time.
0553260111|2.0|I read this book when it first came out because I liked the concept of a trained assassin who has amnesia being on the receiving end of assassination attempts and, as a result, trying to figure out who or what he is. However, the writing is bad, the plot is convoluted, and Marie, the main female character, is not empathetic: she falls \\"in love\\" with the person who threatens and beats her. The ending is convoluted, too. Not a satisfying read. The movie was much more enjoyable.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|ok, we all know one of them has been having trauma caused by the majestic Dave Lombardo, who proved to have talents in all kinds of music, thrash(Slayer), psychedelic(Fantomas), power metal(Grip Inc.)  Having failed any kinds of rock other than thrash(upto Justice~~), that band has always been Pathetica making pathetic garbage. Finally, they found a way to dig a deeper grave and.. I'm sorry for Lulu whose story was ridiculed by this trash. For the vocals, I can't tell who's worse yet this Lou guy seems to be   A horror thriller should scare the audience by the tight & good performance. Speaking of being scared, I was scared. Not because of any good reason, but because of the time and money they wasted on this good scenario.  I've always been curious: did they all have lobotomy without anesthesia around 1993?
B0063IH60K|2.0|loose the ads and this might be a fine version of solitare. many no ad games are better. uninstalled after the second game.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|not to say it's a bad app (it's not), but it does have permission to access your text messages and the internet - a dangerous combination... CarrierIQ is bad enough.
B003VANOFY|2.0|So I had this for 3 weeks after being recommended by a friend. I wanted a wireless headset that fit OVER my ears, not touching them since I use them for long periods. These were the perfect match. I loved them.<br /><br />After a week I noticed a short couple beeps in my headphones, thinking nothing of it I kept using them, after 3 weeks I asked my friend and he said he did not have them. I then noticed the beep was actually the USB dongle disconnecting from the headset, the green light would go out, then flash and come back. It happened every 5 minutes. I tried using the new software from Logitech, it didn't help. I tried using different USB ports, didn't help. I tried using native Windows 7 drivers, it didn't help. I exchanged them with a new set.<br /><br />That day same issue with the new ones, called Logitech since I found I was not the only one with the problem, on teh Logitech forums many folks had this issue. Called support, they really didn't know, so I decided to RMA them back for a refund.<br /><br />With the headset disconnecting, it is a useless device. You may get lucky, and then again, you may have them until your return period is up then it starts to fail...so buyer beware. I am now trying to decide if I want the wired version or just another brand assuming I can find one that truly fits over the ear.<br /><br />EDIT: I went with the G35, the wired version of the G930, and it has yet to fail me. Great headset.

B003L77GG0|4.0|While many fans of the show have shown mixed feelings about the finale after thinking about the entire series from begging to end while it wasn't what many were expecting and while it lets us down a little the finale still was pretty appropriate for the series in general.  If you've seen the show from the first season then this is a must have for any completest fan,  I'm a little sad the see the show finally over but after a long run of ten years the producers and creators have the right to be very proud of the shows success to stay on the air that long.  So for fans of the Superman universe here's comes a great set for us to enjoy and lament a little of a show we knew as Smallville...
B004VPAXIY|5.0|A must have for any Kate fan! Every song offers unbelievable vocal range and thoughtful lyrics/story telling. This is an album to play over and over again. Love it!

This thing requires so much patience,though, as the depth of field is sooo small, even with my f/stop at 18.  A tripod and long exposure help this, of course, and so can flash. I'm more impressed with recording video using this than I am with photography; somehow it seems a bit easier to stay in focus while recording, and gives some pretty interesting results and fun to be had!  For the price, I don't see any better macro options out there. depending on your lens, you may be more or less pleased than I am of course (a zoom lens would get you better, closer macro shots), but as said, even on my nifty-fifty, I couldnt ask for a better entry-level macro product.  Before you go out and blow thousands of dollars to see if macro photography interests you, just buy this snap-on lens instead.
0545123275|2.0|Didn't enjoy this book at all. It was as bland as winter. Always had to look & see who's chapter I was on. Didn't enjoy the characters or the story. Won't waste my time or money finishing the series.

0307454541|5.0|Usually I'm not into the mystery genre, but between this series and Tana French's Irish detective novels, I'm coming around. You probably already know a lot about Girl with the Dragon Tattoo given what a cultural phenomenon it's become, so all I'll say is that as a non-mystery reader, I really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />It takes a while to get into; as with most mystery novels the set up is complex and builds very slowly. However, even during the build-up you can appreciate the experiential feeling of Scandinavian atmosphere in this series. The subdued, dark (in more ways than one) atmosphere sticks with you long after you finish the book. It's definitely a violent book as you probably know, but  I would say it's a positive book for women given the strong female heroine and the unflinching look at the underlying masochism still just beneath the surface of our modernized society.

0345495004|4.0|This is one of those books I can't say I loved reading - it was challenging, dense, and took me a while to get through. However, I learned a lot about architecture and Frank Lloyed Wright, and I feel very happy that I read it. The love story is not super interesting. I barely remember it. However, FLW is pretty interesting and complex. I always just thought he was a boring architect who designed beautiful buildings, but he actually sounds like an eccentric egomaniac who designed really cutting-edge and beautiful buildings. I visited Chicago after reading this, and had such a deeper appreciation for FLW's architectural influence.
0307454894|5.0|My reading of the English translation of this book may be influenced by the outstanding movie version, which won Kate Winslet her (well-deserved) Oscar.<br /><br />Often, when I read the book version of a movie that has moved me deeply I'm disappointed (or vice versa - the movie version of the emotional \\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\\" was a huge disappointment.)<br /><br />The Reader doesn't disappoint on any level.  Perhaps because of my personal experiences (a white South African born to the generation who voted the Apartheid government into power), this novel moved me in ways I can't begin to describe.<br /><br />Stripping away the love story between Michael and Hanna, the way this novel explored and articulated the nature of guilt reflected many of the questions in my own mind. The deceptively simple prose style is ideal for keeping the focus on the soul-wrenching and difficult issues the illogical love Michael feels for Hanna raises in the reader's mind (excuse the pun.)<br /><br />At times I wondered if Hanna wasn't symbolic of Germany herself, and Michael's statement \\"I wanted simultaneously to understand Hanna's crime and to condemn it\\" is a poignant echo of the post-war (or, for that matter, post-apartheid) generation's complex patriotism.<br /><br />Is Hanna's illiteracy and ignorance enough to excuse her? And is it a metaphor for previous generations of people the world over who were simply unaware of the darkness to which that ignorance/lack of education/whatever could lead them to? Should we condemn or understand them? And, if we condemn those who have lived before us, what will future generations - those yet-to-be-born generations who will have more knowledge on which to base their choices and actions than we have - find to condemn in our behaviour? Perhaps in a hundred years times vegetarian children will have to bear the guilt of previous generations who (considering themselves perfectly civilised and moral beings) today deliberately slaughter living creatures to eat.<br /><br />This novel almost defies categorisation and review. As Michael himself says, \\"The tectonic layers of our lives rest so tightly one on top of the other that we always come up against earlier events in later ones, not as matter that has been fully formed and pushed aside, but absolutely present and alive. I understand this. Nevertheless, I sometimes find it hard to bear.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes I find it hard to bear that I and my beloved parents - good, ordinary people, all of us, or so I like to think - were simply too concerned with bread-and-butter issues to fight the evil of apartheid and become heroes of \\"the struggle.\\" Sometimes I find it hard to bear that, just as the German psyche will never be entirely free of the guilt of the Holocaust, so the white South African psyche will never be entirely free of the guilt of Apartheid.<br /><br />Bernhard Schlink does an admirable job in addressing a topic that raises difficult moral and legal questions, none of which has easy answers.<br /><br />\\"The Reader\\" is a necessary read for anyone who needs to learn that there are three sides to every story in our collective and individual histories: the victim's side, the oppressor's side and the truth that can never be fully known or understood. As Michael says \\"Whatever I had done or not done, whatever [Hanna] had done or not done...it was the path my life had taken...there are many different stories in addition to the one I have written.\\"<br /><br />There are no guarantees that the story of the good and evil that mankind is capable of will not be repeated: the victim may become the oppressor, the oppressor the victim. As I write this review, the Palestinians live in ghettos under Israeli rule. On Black Tuesday 22-11-11, in South Africa, the black ANC government has voted in favour of an information bill, which limits the democratic freedom of speech, while the good, ordinary people (as in previous eras) were too concerned with bread-and-butterissues to care about some law whose significance they didn't fully comprehend.<br /><br />So, who knows what those who find it easier to condemn than to understand would do if a malicious Fate places them in Hanna's shoes? \\"What would you have done?\\" Hanna asks the judge presiding over her war crimes trial. But she got no answer and nor did she expect one.<br /><br />This simply written tale is a melancholy and insightful book that will linger in my mind for a long time. While it gives no easy solutions, it does provoke a deep and thoughtful analysis of how the human spirit copes when confronted with deep and horrifying truths about one's individual and collective identity.what those who find it easier to condemn than to understand would do if a malicious Fate places them in Hanna's shoes? \\"What would you have done?\\" Hanna asks the judge presiding over her war crimes trial.

0312370849|5.0|This book is sad, beautiful, and incredibly gripping. I think I read it in a day. It's rare to read a book that sticks with you so profoundly and yet reads so quickly. I learned a lot about Paris during Nazi occupation (it was much darker than I expected), and visited Paris about a year and found myself feeling haunted by this story. I love books that really alter your knowledge about the world. I think most people would probably enjoy this book.

The combination can be memorable and intoxicating, to the point where I would consider reading this book in Mendocino to BE an important event in my life!

1416562605|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It's a quick, entertaining read and an interesting story that is metaphorical for modern India, I guess. I see why it's the type of edgy, provocative, original book that wins awards. It isn't the type of book I love (usually a gripping historical plot where I come away thinking I learned something about a culture or time period). However, I do think it provides an interesting point of view and is worth a read.

B0056BMK6K|3.0|He writes a lot of things that you already know. You need to market your book on social networks. Cool. He goes into detail (mostly about how to work twitter), but he doesn't really show you how to get any sort of following. He says find your target market, but there are no ways of doing this, especially on twitter which seems to be a huge chunk of his marketing.<br /><br />He obviously knows what he's doing... look at his success. One thing this book does is motivates you and it makes you sort of think differently about your marketing approach. Although, I may have done most of what he's said in the book, I may not have been as motivated to do so.<br /><br />The writing of this book itself is really good. I read it in one sitting, so that says something. It's short, but like others have said, it probably could have been shorter.<br /><br />One thing that he said was that it was his marketing strategy that got him where he is. And it's true to an extent, but he got pretty lucky for his blogs to just go viral like that. I could write a blog about Michael J. Fox, send it to people that would be interested and hope beyond all hope that it goes viral, but it probably wouldn't. His did. That's what got him there. But his marketing is what got him to the point of writing the blog post. I dunno. I felt a little gipped after reading it.<br /><br />He said he had a reason for EVERYTHING he does. I think his reason for this one was to make money, knowing that he had a really good marketing strategy and that he got pretty lucky too.<br /><br />I'd recommend it for cheaper.

B004222UC8|5.0|This record is absolutely fantastic. Martin sounds a tad like dio but definitely has his own character. Songs like \\"Born to Lose\\"  and \\"Hard Life To Love\\" would have been filler with dio but here they're classic. The bonus disc is ok, but to me Gillen sounds like Martin if he was recording with a head cold.  All in all check this record out, don't judge it because it says sabbath on it.
B005FNGAD8|5.0|Billy Joel's second solo album garnered good radio play and sales with the hit single \\"Piano Man\\". The remaster of the first disc is pretty well done (although the Mobile Fidelity SACD is the best sounding master out there)but the real reason to pick this up is the superb second disc--Joel did a live radio concert at Philadelphia's WMMR on April 15, 1972 putting on an exceptional performance with his touring band with selections from his first two solo albums.<br /><br />This holy grail of live performances for Joel fanatics finally appears with excellent sound (it has been bootlegged over the years) and allows fans to hear three songs that Joel never recorded in the studio-- the exceptional \\"Long, Long Time\\", \\"Josephine\\" and a song written for Joel's mother \\"Rosalinda\\" (a different song from the popular Joel song \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\").<br /><br />The mastering here by Ted Jensen (and the remixing which includes some minor fixes to the tapes including the addition of a missing note and the removal of mistakes on one track by Joel's drummer at the time)is pretty good for the radio performance. Capturing Joel early in his career before fame began to overwhelm him and with his early touring band the performances are exceptionally good with Joel an engaging and charming performer. The song performances are separated out from Joel's introductions so that those who just want to hear the songs can program their CD player to skip the introductions or rip them without them.<br /><br />We also get an excellent booklet that discusses the circumstances around both the recording of Joel's second album as well as the radio show performance and how it occurred.<br /><br />I'm hoping that at some point the other albums will get deluxe reissues with various shows added as a second disc but even if this (along with the deluxe \\"The Stranger\\" from a couple of years back) is all we get, I'm satisfied with both the quality and the pricing (this is priced the same as a single disc release)of this set.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|Its a good book, definitely worth the two fidy.  Half of what youd pay for a vanity fair at the airport.  There are some worthwhile ideas and definitely sheds some light into  Cubans outlook on things.  He's a smart guy.  Two things to remember though.    Cuban is smarter most people.  So this whole If I can do it so can you is a little misleading.      Second thing to  remember with Cuban is that luck (timing) had a huge part in him making his dough.  Without which he would be just a rich dallas guy worth 10-20mm, no Mavs, no Celebrity, and I dare say no G5.    He definitely got out there and in the right position when he sold Broadcast, but make no mistake, Broadcast wouldnt be worth a plug nickel today.  Cuban was smart enough to sell at the top, but it wasn't like he was a Rockefeller or Gates who created something with long term value (although he did this with the Mavs).  He sold into the bubble right before it burst, and has been enjoying it even since.  Well played sir.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|WOW..... I have been trying to decide which headset to purchase with my new \\"Special Edition MW3\\" XBox. This thing is absolutely great! Sound is crystal clear and a bit scary at the same time. I swear I could hear the enemy sneaking up behind me several times. Sounds seem to come from everywhere all at once. This is going to take some getting used to after playing war games with TV speakers on my PS3. I did test out the crackle and pop some folks spoke about. I am a Computer Network Installer by trade and I use allot of shielded cabling in my home. Everything was cool in the living room, but when I got to close to my network closet my Cisco Wireless Router did cause a pop or two until I moved away from it. I am using the HDMI output on the XBox, I was happy to find that on my unit, I did not have to use the enclosed standard connector as the optics connection for the sound is built into the unit instead of the connector. A very clean install indeed. I walked all over my large living room and it never made a sound. Now back to MW3 on my 85 inch Mitsubishi TV..... Time to take the fight to the enemy now....
1451648537|5.0|This is really a one-of-a-kind book about a one-of-a-kind man.  There aren't adequate words to describe Steve Jobs who I suspect will eventually be known as the Man of the Decade if not the Man of the Century.  He beats Einstein, Henry Ford and even Tesla combined with what he was capable of.  The bizarre personality + the unmeasurable depth of his brain = a simply indescribable man.  I recommend this book to everyone.  If you can read, read it.  It's a magnificent portrayal of what is possible when you use more than the 15% of the brain that scientists say is all we use.  I'll bet this man used 87% if not more.  Maybe 93%.  It's a good book to teach young adults the Art of the Possible and to remind yourself of what YOU are capable of.
B000002MG1|5.0|I cannot top Biker385's accurate and insightful review, but just a few thoughts on AFTP by REM.  I don't write many reviews, but R.E.M. deserves at least one from me, since they are (or were) one of the greats and this album I believe is their best.  I started listening to REM with the release of \\"Reckoning\\". They were known as an underground band played mostly on college stations in the early '80s.  Of the great bands over the last half century of rock, most have had several good song writers as members.  What I mean by that is that, unlike superstars who are famous on their own, REM is a band of many talented members and the \\"whole is greater than the sum of the parts\\". This is true of REM. I became a solid fan with \\"Fables\\", but Automatic to the people brought my appreciation of REM to a whole new level. The depth of emotion in the singing and the deep meaning of the lyrics is what makes this record different. I bought \\"Monster\\" the day it came out, and I liked it, but it was not like AFTP.  After REM became a \\"Monster\\" group, I started to loose interest. To me, they became like the Rolling Stones after \\"Exile\\" relying on formula and just putting out records because they had signed the largest record contract in history (at that time). Not to diminish REM post-AFTP (or the Stones for that matter) but for me, this record was their creative peak.

After all these years the more I learn about 'the lads' the more fascinated I am with George..Did anyone really know him? Seems like a great guy-glad his wife shared this with us all. Still there must be a deeper level of George-no one ever lets you in on his personal side they just give you a little taste.<br />When I read he missed dinner most nights because he loved being in his gardens I wonder how 'detached' a person he was--nothing wrong with it just  these types of things are never really made clear...maybe thats how he would have wanted it. Patti Boyds book I found was more on a personal level-but she was writing about herself most of the time..Maybe Olivia Harrison shoould have given us a little more of herself.....
B002OSY2T6|3.0|I had high hopes when I bought this toy.  I was sure my, then 5 month old child, would love it.  She did show interest in it, but it never taught her to do anything.  If it rolled away, she just got interested in something else.  It is really cute and cheerful with fun music, but she was most interested in the mirror on it.  Also, it will start playing music in the middle of the night if it isn't turned off.  I guess it is very sensitive to vibrations or something. (we live near a train track).  I don't want to put this toy down, I think maybe it just wasn't right for my child.  She has always been really active and early in development.

B005M2A4D4|4.0|Season five of the world's longest running Sci-Fi television show introduced us to the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith). Like all the previous Doctors had to spend some time figuring out just who he was and what kind of Doctor he was going to be.  With his bowtie and Fez hat, Season Five lead us to believe that the Eleventh Doctor was a fun-loving cosmic tourist, out to see the Universe with his companion the Amazing Amy Pond and her beloved Rory.  But it turns out that isn't who the Eleventh Doctor is at all.<br /><br />The Eleventh Doctor is Batman.<br /><br />In Doctor Who - The Complete Sixth Series, the character and the storyline take a distinct and drastic tone-shift to Gotham  City.  Like the 1950s' Batman to the 1980s' Batman, The Doctor went from fun-loving (but dangerous) good times to actual death and cruelty.  In an interview, series writer Stephen Moffat has said that this direction-shift was purposeful, and in Season Six he tried to \\"Batmanize\\" the Doctor Who series.<br /><br />By Batmanize, he meant not only the darker tone of the series, but the idea that Batman creates his own enemies.  If there was no Batman, there would be no Joker, no Two-Face, no people who define themselves as being in conflict with the Batman.  Moffat felt that with The Doctor's legend as a powerful and mighty warrior, he would give rise to people whose sole mission in life is to fight The Doctor, by any means necessary.  He also wanted a villain on the level of the Weeping Angels, something terrifying enough that they would enter the Doctor Who mythos along with the Cybermen and the Daleks.  To fill that role he gave us The Silence.<br /><br />It took me awhile to warm up to Moffat's vision.  Even though I was totally against Matt Smith when he took over as The Doctor--after deciding that the Tenth Doctor was the greatest of all-time--I was instantly won over by the light-hearted and fun nature of the interpretation.  I loved the idea of a magical childhood figure come to life, and was put off by the first episode of Season Six--\\"The Impossible Astronaut\\"--which serves up death as an opener and only got darker from there.  Sure, there were some lighthearted blasts of entertainment in there, but things were pretty grim. But by the time of the seventh episode, \\"A Good Man Goes to War,\\" the quality storytelling had won me over and I was totally hooked into Moffat's vision. I saw how terrifying it is when the light-hearted man turns deadly serious.<br /><br />And Season Six is serious. Without giving away any spoilers, Season Six deals with some big questions for The Doctor.  The main one--Who is River Song? -turns out to be an amazing twist that took me by surprise.  Even deeper than that, The Doctor must come to grips with why he has Companions when so many of them die, and what is his role in the Universe on the whole?  It is some bleak stuff, and the answers aren't really fun.  The episode \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" was particularly heart-wrenching.<br /><br />My only disappointment with Series Six was the lack of continuity of emotion.  Some of the episodes, like \\"The Girl Who Waited,\\" were completely devastating to those involved, but with the next episode they were right as rain and back to cracking wise and the best of friends.  If you are like me and only watch Doctor Who on DVDs--one right after the other--then it can be disconcerting to see a character developed and then white-washed over the space of two sequential episodes.<br /><br />The DVD box set itself is adequately excellent.  I am glad I waited for the complete sixth season rather than getting the separate Part One and Part Two boxsets.  This set includes not only all the episodes, but also the Christmas special, the two Comic Relief sketches, the prequels, and some cool extras like \\"Monster Files\\" and Doctor Who Confidential.  I know they are planning to come out with a limited-edition set featuring four lenticular prints with various characters.  If you are a collector you might want to wait for that. Personally, I care more about what is on the DVDs than what they box is made of, so this set was perfect.e about what is on the DVDs than what they box is made of, so this set was perfect.
B0002EXH40|4.0|In 1990, Megadeth released the critically-acclaimed thrash-metal masterpiece, \\"Rust in Peace\\". Their 1992 follow-up album, \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" (which also received extremely positive reception) kept the Megadeth spirit alive, but perhaps broadened their horizons a bit as it moved away from the band's thrash-metal roots. The band's 1994 studio-effort, entitled \\"Youthanasia\\" (a play on words with \\"euthanasia\\") saw the band continuing this trend even more so than their previous \\"Countdown to Extinction.\\". To say that slower tempo's and more melodic phrasing moves Megadeth further away from thrash-territory would be correct, but to say that it makes Megadeth less metal would be an inacurate assumption - and more than likely one from someone whom has never actually listened to the record.  You can throw that accusation out the window, though, because \\"Youthanasia\\" hits on a level that none of the other Megadeth albums really have. It's not necessarily as \\"balls-out\\" as \\"Peace Sells...but Who's Buying?\\" (1986) or \\"Rust in Peace\\" (1990), but it's not as melodic as the bands two follow-up album's \\"Cryptic Writings\\" (1997) and \\"Risk\\" (1999). It's somewhere in between, and it's a noise that I can't really describe - but I like it!  The album kicks off with \\"Reckoning Day\\", a song that can only be described by its legendary guitar-riff, pounding drum-beat and bone-chilling vocals/lyrics provided by Dave Mustaine. It really is the perfect way to kick off an album, especially one like this. It fits like a glove, and has proven to be one of the bands better songs over the years.  \\"Train of Consequences\\", the album's second track, starts off with what can only be described as a jackhammer-riff that should prove all naysayers of Megadeth wrong and that the band, even at this point in their career, have still stayed in heavy-metal territory. The song has a simple-yet-fitting drum beat, a catchy bass-riff as well as an equally catchy guitar-riff alongside the \\"in-your-face\\" lyrics that really just get you off your seat, head-banging and singing along (\\"There's bad news creeping up, and you feel a sudden chill! How do ya do? My name is Trouble, I'm coming in for the kill!\\"). A true stand-out song.  \\"Addicted to Chaos\\" - the title says it all. A pounding, foot-stomping, head-banging drum-beat kicks the track off followed by the considerably melodic guitar-riff and verse(s)/chorus(s). It's a very cool song and definetely a great track in its own right, as it features more signature Dave Mustaine lyrics (\\"In a dream I cannot see, tangled abstract fallacy, random turmoil builds in me, I'm addicted to chaos!\\"). The track leaves you wanting more, and gets increasingly better with each listen.  \\"A Tout le Monde\\" is the fourth track on the album, and is more of a slow, ballad-type song. However, it should not be mistaken as a bad song, since it is truly one of the strongest on the whole album, as well as the band's entire arsenal. With lyrics pertaining to leaving loved-ones behind, an amazing guitar-riff/solo, and one of the best vocal performances by Dave Mustaine in his whole career (including an entire chorus in FRENCH!), \\"A Tout le Monde\\" really is a stand-out song on the album and one of the best in the whole band's line-up.  The fifth-track, \\"Elysian Fields\\" is a relatively dark track with lyrics deemed on ancient warfare and Greek gods, etc. It's a cool song with a spine-chilling chorus, and a gut-churning guitar-riff.  The sixth song on the album, entitled \\"The Killing Road\\" is about the band's path to self-destruction (as made easy to see by the somewhat personal lyrics). The song has a sick guitar-riff that delivers a certain punch that one cannot describe, only enjoy. Definetely a good song, if not one of the album's best.  \\"Blood of Heroes\\" marks another enjoyable listen, but I honestly feel that, even though it is a good song, this is where the album begins to lose steam for just a moment. This next few songs feel more like background music, althought they are good, as I don't want anyone to misunderstand me. This song has some cool lyrics and punchy guitar-riff as usual, but there's little that stands-out here.  \\"Family Tree\\" is another background-type song, nothing worth dying for but nothing worth hating. It's most notable feature are the lyrics, which have those signature Dave Mustaine lyrics popping up again and again (\\"Forgotten things remembered, the tiger's eat their young! The body stayed, but inside the head the mind was on the run!\\"). I can't say it's a bad song - as it's not one at all, it just lacks that certain punch that previous songs like \\"Addicted to Chaos\\" and \\"Train of Consequences\\" had going.  \\"Youthanasia\\" is the album's title track and features a melodic guitar-riff as well as melodic vocals. It has this \\"up-and-down\\" kind of atmosphere but keeps it heavy throught the riff and the lyrics. It's still not a stand-out, but it's not a \\"fade-away\\", if you will.  \\"I Thought I Knew It All\\" is where the album starts to pick up steam again. It's a collaborative effort, as every member of the band pitched-in in writing it, so it sort of falls somewhere along the lines of a heavier version of \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" (I mean the song, of course). It's a cool song but isn't quite one of the best on the album.  \\"Black Curtains\\" is the balls-out, butt-kicking, head-banging song that picks the album back up (even, though, to be honest, it never fell-off (all that much, anyways) to begin with.) It features very dark, metal-esque lyrics and has grown to be one of my favorites on the album - a true standout. Very heavy, very dark, very metal, very awesome!  \\"Victory\\" is the final song on the album, and actually looks back on previous Megadeth songs in the lyrics. It's very cool, and I love how it ties them all up into a story. It's a balls-out rocker, and is just a kick-butt song that doesn't let up - and a great way to end a great album!  Since this is the 2004 remastered version, thereare four bonus-tracks. There are demo versions for \\"Millenium of the Blind\\", \\"New World Order\\" (both of which have been finalized and officialy released on the band's thirteenth studio-release, \\"Th1rt3en\\"), \\"A Tout le Monde\\" and a previously unreleased instrumental dubbed \\"Absolution\\". The \\"MOTB\\"-demo  features far less lyrics and is more instrumental than the finalized version, and the \\"New World Order\\" demo actually remains rather unchanged for the most part. The \\"A Tout le Monde\\" demo is a bit longer (although I prefer the original, still) and \\"Absolution\\" is a nice little three-and-a-half instrumental that is cool, but not worth dying over.  Ultimately, I would rate this album with four-stars. It's a very good album that sees Megadeth during a more interesting time in their career. The best songs on the album are \\"Reckoning Day\\", \\"Train of Consequences\\", \\"Addicted to Chaos\\", \\"A Tout le Monde\\", and \\"Black Curtains\\" (you could add \\"Victory\\" up there if you wanted). If you're trying to get into Megadeth, you may want to start more practical (try \\"Rust in Peace\\" or \\"Peace Sells\\", or \\"Greatest Hits: Back to the Start\\"), but if you've already gotten all of their \\"big\\" records and you're wanting more, \\"Youthanasia\\" is the right to place to look.   One of their most underrated albums, yet one of their best - I would strongly recommend this to any Megadeth fan.  Recap:  Rating: 4 Stars.  Strong-Points: Reckoning Day, Train of Consequences, Addicted to Chaos, A Tout le Monde, Black Curtains.  Low-Points: Blood of Heroes, Family Tree, Youthanasia.  What's Unique?: It shows Megadeth going down a more melodic road with their music, but as it's still very heavy, it can be considered a cross between \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" and \\"Cryptic Writings\\", two albums that don't generally go together.  Any Megadeth fan should own this album - do NOT overlook it!   You will NOT be disappointed!

B001IBV694|5.0|WHile I was flipping through reviews on here I read one titled \\"you should watch the movie first\\". Are you kidding me?? That movie was completely unwatchable to me! I never finished it. The movie was focused more on the unthinkable deeds done in this book than the idea behind the book (oh I know shocking coming from Stanely Kubrick (this is sarcasm)). The book is one of the few that I try to read almost every year. I have read it countless times and come away with something new and interesting every time. It has a feeling of accidental profoundness. The reason I picked it up before was because 7 years ago when I was in high school it was banned from school libraries and curriculum because of it's \\"racy content\\". I like every other teen in my high school found something exhilarating about reading a banned book... SO of course I picked it up and finished it in two days!  The book follows a group of delinquent misfits who run around the city wreaking havoc on all it's inhabitants. It is written in a sort of made up slang which at first is difficult to follow, but after a chapter you start to easily imply it's meaning by connecting the words with their context (not nearly as complicated as some reviews on here would make you believe!)... ANYWAY... The leader of the group is arrested and subjected to visual brainwash. In the end the reader is presented with the concept of right and wrong and how the line can be occasionally blurred based on beliefs and backgrounds. It shares a sense of classical epic-ness in the same way \\"1984\\" and \\"A brave new world do\\"... but in my opinion it is easier and more rewarding a read than the other two!

B002VUFKG6|2.0|As well as many other readers, I enjoyed the tales of her travels.  She is an amazing narrator and can take you with her around the world.  This is precisely why I believe Eat, Pray, Love was such a huge success.  Oh, but the frustration of the reader!  I understand that she wants to be careful with marriage and applaud her for figuring out her life.  But at one point, when stating that a good, loving marriage takes relationship skills and tools, she asks, \\"Is this excruciatingly obvious to everyone else?  Because it wasn't excruciatingly obvious to me\\".  Yes, EXCRUCIATINGLY OBVIOUS.  DUH.  Marriage and infatuation are different.  DUH, marriage takes compromise, understanding and attaining a higher level of self.  I was kind of annoyed with her assumption that her previous capriciousness was commonplace among modern women.  On the other hand, it was enlightening to see how oblivious some people are to the realities in life, blinded by one's desires.  I guess I am the oblivious one!  Also, she kind of downgrades some traditional cultures, saying that they are all the same.  To be fair, the blinded capricious young Western female who has had lover after lover is not that unique either.  Anyway, lots of boring and agonizing rumination about marriage.  Maybe good for her.  Not so good for her readers.  By the way, I am an EG fan and generally find her inspiring.  Loved the TED talk, loved the talk about 'getting one's life together'.  I find her public personality very attractive and respectable.  My disappointment with this book does not change any of that.  More of the beautiful poetic description, please.  You are gifted in that area.
0670888796|5.0|Although it may be cliche to say, the book is so much better than the movie. And the edition of the book that I borrowed from Austin Public Library was terrific. It's called The Whole Story edition and gives illustrations from the original volume with an annotated history of London at the time that Dickens was writing the story. This hardcover also explains the settings and characters that were similar to Dickens' own life.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It's refreshing in this day and age to see a moralistic tale written without reference to religious symbolism. To me, the message under the story is so much more universally delivered this way because people with all different belief systems still get the transformation that Scrooge undergoes.<br /><br />I also love the concept embedded in the story about how rapidly a person can change. Unlike in Dickens' time, today we have the science to prove that if you want to change your life, all you have to do is change your mind. That's what Scrooge did and he underwent an instant and dramatic transition to a happier and more fulfilling life.<br /><br />If you're feeling humbug about the holidays, I suggest you read \\"A Christmas Carol\\".
B004EPZ020|3.0|PA1 was fantastic. Really had you checking under your bed. PA2 was great too. The guys basically handled the haunting in the  same way, but you'd expect that as these story lines happened parallel to each other (same time period). But, it's like they slapped PA3 together like late homework. Then there's the same story line with oh, something's happening so the guy puts up cameras and nobody notices what's on the film til it's too late. The people that made PA1 and PA2 showed a true gift. Guess the gift ran out!

B000W7JWUA|1.0|My adult siblings love this game. So when they visited, they brought it for all of us to enjoy.  It takes one full game to really start to understand it and to develop your strategies.  I really gave it an honest effort and figured that once I got the hang of it, I would grow to like the game. Unfortunately, this was not the case.  I played several games and soon realized I would rather light my hair on fire or ride a bicycle without a seat down a bumpy road than continue playing this game.  The game is very slow moving and while strategy is an important part of the game, too much is left to chance.  All in all, I would not recommend this game.
B004UVCOZ4|4.0|I bought this box set because I wanted three of the twenty albums in the set. However, if you're looking for the cookin album, it's not on disc 8 like it's supposed to be.  It is just a copy of Milestones, one of the albums I wanted.  If you are only interested in getting the music, and not the liner notes, album art, then this is a great sounding collection of 1950's Miles Davis. Check the independent vendors, I got this set for a little more than $18 including shipping. I got it in about 4 days undamaged. Play it loud and enjoy.
0895260131|1.0|We got this book hoping to get some information about Islam.  Instead, the author presents a very biased view of Islam, insisting that Mohammad and all Muslims since then teach and practice violence.  The author reminds me of some of the John Birchers of the 1950s, with their negative diatribes against the Jews and communists. According to the author, Muslims have no good in them, they are full of hatred against Christians, and are taught this hatred from an early age.  He is particularly anxious that people who see the new film, \\"The Kingdom of Heaven,\\" should not get the \\"wrong idea\\" that Muslims could practice a loving, peaceful spiritual life.  He even blames the Muslims for the crusades.  If you want to get a good inside look at the thinking of some bigoted extremists who believe we are in a war against Islam, you might enjoy this book.  If you want to learn about Islam, try another book.  Are there \\"negative stars?\\"  If so, two negative stars for this one.

There's a ton of facts in here that will blow your mind! This book is a must read! Defintely one of the best books I've read!
0321704452|3.0|When I first began to read this book, I tried to look at it as a novel.  I began to read it as if there was going to be a natural flow within the book itself.  I was quickly proven wrong.  I could not read this book in a sitting or two, I had to jump around and read the book by topics.  Once I realized that this book had dozens and dozens of topics, I could pick and chose what would apply to me on any given day or moment.    Reynolds separates the book into seven main contents.  Beginning with a basic introduction of who the book is for and what does it mean to Present Naked...going through to the need for improvement through Persistence.  At the end of each chapter he gives a \\"SUM\\" of the work presented.  As with any language, it is imperative to know what the person is saying.  Reynolds uses these SUMS to give bullet points of the previous information.  It is the \\"takeaway\\"..a word that I do not like...of the chapter.  Between each chapter, Reynolds uses quotes from artists, journalists, intellectuals to drive home the point he is making in the chapter and the book.  Presentations can be easy and fun...but you must follow certain rules in order to be successful.  Reynolds currently lives in Japan and is a student of the Zen arts.  He uses Japanese language and culture throughout the book to emphasize his points on presentations.  His approach to presentations \\"embraces the tenets of restraint, simplicity and naturalness.  HADAKA NO TSUKIAI--NAKED COMMUNICATION is the underlying concept of the book.  Reynolds is not suggesting we \\"literally get naked\\" but rather make our presentations an extension of who we are.  We must prepare, but not over prepare.  We must remember we are talking to INDIVIDUALS and not an abstract group.  Although this is not part of Reynolds' book, these analogies always remind me of the episode of The Brady Bunch where Marsha had to take her driving test and got very nervous.  She was suggested to visualize the instructor in his underwear andit made her laugh and calmed her down.  This is very similar to the concepts Reynolds is trying to convey.  Another nice take Reynolds does in his book is the use of color photos and illustrations to drive home his point.  He does not over-illustrate and does not give a paragraph explanation of the photo or illustration.  Reynolds seems to abide by the adage:  KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID  SUM:  After getting over the inability to read it like a novel, enjoyed the book and its concepts on public presentations.

0752874764|5.0|i started out by reading the print version of this book and switched shortly into it to the audio version.  Boy, am I glad I did.  The narrator is absolutely wonderful.  I think this is the first time i've heard a narrator do a woman and a man, husband and wife, and truly sound like both a man and a woman. Excellent as she is as the mother, her job as the father took my breath away.  the writer's handling of the father is no less adept.  For the father is constantly in kevin's corner, believing him over the evidence which keeps piling up that someing is wrong with kevin and they better start talking about it.  whenever they try though, they occupy opposite poles, the husband believes every preposterous story kevin proposes while the wife sees straight through him as if he were transparent. of course, the father loves the son unreservedly and with total commitment to him.<br /><br />for those people who believe guns are the problem, the author does an interesting switch,  the son has taken archery at school for six years and is an expert archer.  He kills evereyone with arrows he shoots from a crossbow.  this is very clever because we need never get into discussing guns, gun control, whether guns kill people or people kill people, etc., etc., archery is an olympic sport so everyone is blissfully unaware of why kevin is becoming such an expert at it.  perhaps they just think he plans on being an olympic contender.<br /><br />much as i loved the non fiction book COLUMBINE by david cullen, this books cuts out entirely different territory.  it gets deeply into the characters themselves in the family unit rather than pouring through evidence.in the case.  i think the extreme denial practiced by kevin's father is very similar to the real life denial practiced by eric harris's father in  columbine.<br /><br />this is excellent writing, excellent narrating. i think it would be a perfect selection for book clubs.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B004FGMDOQ|1.0|I bought this book for my granddaughter, who is an advanced reader.  My choice was based on the reviews.  Although the book has an imaginative story line, and the characters are well defined, I would not recommend it for children under the age of sixteen.      The book makes frequent use of obscene language. I would give examples, but they cannot be published in an Amazon review.  In a couple of instances, there are \\"jokes\\" that are simply vile and sexist.  This book is also something of a rip off.  There is no ending, just a set up for the next book in what will obviously be a \\"teen series\\".  If you are looking for a great book for your older child or early teen, please steer clear, or read it yourself before giving it.  I wish I had.

0307949508|5.0|I really liked The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and took a break after I finished it. When I picked up The Girl Who Played With Fire, I could not put it down. The action never stops, you learn so much more about the main characters and are rooting for them throughout the 630 pages. I stayed up late and set my alarm for earlier than usual to read some more in the mornings. Highly recommended.
B004WCTLNY|1.0|This movie started out like a political thriller, then quickly crumbled into an existential mess. Matt Damon plays a senate candidate who meets the girl of his dreams. According to God's plan, he needs to be kept away from this girl so he wins political office. The Men-In-Hats (God's enforcers) do every thing they can to keep them away from each other.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is there is no reason to root for one side or the other. The powers that be (God and the fedora wearing angels) want him to be elected to the senate and then president. But we're never told why this is a good thing. The only thing standing in his way of obtaining the highest political office is his love for a free spirited dancer (who he meets while she's hiding in the Men's room from hotel security). Damon and Blunt have very little chemistry, which leaves you wondering why he would drop everything for a girl he made out with in front of the urinals.<br /><br />This movie was boring because it was pointless. He doesn't seem like that great a politician, their romance doesn't seem that compelling, and the bad guys don't seem particularly bad. There was nothing at stake and nothing to root for.

B0012GMWCA|4.0|\\"Lucky Town\\"  #3  (1992).  This is probably the strongest of the two cd's ,  in \\"Lucky Town\\", Bruce brought in organist from the Faces and Small Faces Ian Mclagan, Steve Miller drummer Gary Mallaber and Lone Justice guitarist Shane Fontayne.  Bruce gave us the masterful \\"Better Days\\", #2 MSR, the classic title track, the anthem \\"Local Hero\\", the smooth \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\", \\"Leap Of Faith\\", #28 MSR is a great rocker, \\"Livin' Proof\\", is a solid rocker very E-Street Bandish, \\"Souls Of The Departed\\", smokes, and his \\"My Beautiful Reward\\", is one classy song.  Springsteen was 42 at the time.  Bruce got the E-Streeet Band back together again in 1999.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|the first time i heard this album, i have to say, i was kinda disappointed. but those were only cursory listens. after buying the album and sitting down and really listening to it, i have to say it's a great album. though i do still like ENDGAME better, i'll say that this is a great addition to the megadeth that started it's run of great albums with 'the system has failed'. this album has a lot of elements from albums like 'countdown' and 'youthanasia' in it, and at the same time has some great ass kickers too. there are only a few songs that really dont do it for me. the biggest example of this being 'guns, drugs, and money'. i just cant dig that song. the rest however is great in it's own way. a lot of people are complaining about the inclusion of older songs like 'millennium of the blind' and 'new world order' but i think they sound great here. finally fleshed out into full songs. for a band that had only 2 months to write and record a full album, i think they did a helluva job. if you're a fan of the 'countdown' or 'youth' albums, i think you'll like this one just fine. really looking forward to album #14, when they reteam with andy sneap now. should be another killer.
B0000028SR|4.0|\\"Human Touch\\" #2  (1992).  Released at the same time as \\"Lucky Town\\", just like Guns And Roses did in 1991.  This to me is one of the worst things the record companies did back in the early 90's.  This album is Bruce's 3rd solo album without the E-Street Band, only Roy Bitten appears on this disc.  Bruce brought in session guitarist Tim Pierce, old E-Street member David Sancious, the late Jeff Porcaro (Toto) on drums,(one of his last sessions) and American Idol's own Randy Jackson on bass.  This release is a polished set in, \\"Human Touch\\", #1 MSR, #16 hot 100,  the breezy \\"Soul Driver\\", \\"57 Channels (And Nothing On)\\", #6 MSR, #68 hot 100, not much on in '92.  You also get the rowdy \\"Roll Of The Dice\\"# 6 MSR, \\"Man's Job\\", the playful \\"All Or Nothing At All\\" and the gentle \\"Pony Boy\\".
0307472841|2.0|Highlights:  The opening chapters are strong and powerful. The images and the personalities are rich - one feels everything  The premise for the crime is great way to drive a novel  Low lights:  Everything else.  The protagonist bears no resemblance to characters Henning has created else where: she is flat and boring, rather than interesting and alive. She has no real complexity or internal dialogue. She doesn't really talk to anyone else either (not her husband, children, long time friend) except a stranger she meets in Beijing. She has to be the most boring Swede on the planet.  The plot lacks interesting development, much less any plot twists. In the end, one is left wondering \\"why\\" for so many of the clues that Henning gives the reader along the way. Henning takes us down many roads but we never reach the end of any of them, and wonder why he has bothered to take us down quite a few.  Too much lecturing not enough story telling. It is great when stories make political points;it is an entirely different matter when more effort is spent on lecturing about Swedish society falling apart, corruption and power in China or China's neo-colonial actions in Africa or America's horrible treatment of immigrants in the 1800s or . . .   Random acts of Henning - I just can't quite get over all the random things that happen throughout the story in order to make the story \\"work\\". The character who all of a sudden appears in the book, makes a remarkable shot, into a space that no one had any reason to believe a character was at, is really only one of the many such incidents throughout the book.   In short  If you have never read any Henning, this is not the book to start with.  If you have read a lot of Henning, this is a book you can skip  if you are looking for another Scandinavian crime novel, try reading Snow Angels by James Thompson

Not quite pack the punch of earlier epics like \\"The Stand\\" but still effective novel with a wide scope. A few *deep* ideas mixed in with what is really pop entertainment. Worth a read for King fans and non-fans alike. Interesting idea for a novel. King applies his usual readable style. The story is complex but never confusing. A different take on familiar time travel themes and it works very well.

B00447G2PM|5.0|I am new to the 3D world. Last week I purchased my first 60\\" Samsung 3D TV and a Samsung 3D Blu-ray player and I was very excited about buying some 3D videos to view it. I particularly enjoy documentaries and wanted a 3D movie about a documentary rather than a regular 3D movie or animated 3D movie. Sadly, the choices available are virtually non-existent except for a few 3D documentaries. I am aware of several \\"under the sea\\" type of 3D documentaries that are being sold here in Amazon. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to get this one.   I am extremely thrilled and very happy with this spectacular IMAX 3D movie. IMAX: Deep Sea is simply an amazing experience. I absolutely loved it!! IMAX 3D is AMAZING! One thing I want to stress is that not all 3D's are made the same. IMAX uses technology which is by far the best and most amazing in terms of quality.   I am so satisfied that I am planning to purchase other IMAX \\"under the sea\\" 3D videos. I really had a good time watching it and learned a lot from this video.  I would like to stress to get 3D videos made by IMAX. You will not be disappointed. The technology is breath taking!!  Highly recommended!!
B0025UHKNS|1.0|The first watch arrived without US plugs, and I sent it back. The second and third ones arrived broken. So, while I can't speak to the effectiveness of the watch I can review the packaging and general initial experience. In the end I just got my money back.<br /><br />The box includes a lot of items that arrive in unmarked identical plastic baggies. The initial thought on getting it out of the box is one of confusion. There is some screwdrive that I cant figure out a use for. There is a CD that does not contain software, but only PDF files of the booklets that are also included (why have a CD and redundant booklets?). There are international plug adapters, but my first watch arrived without a US plug adapter and I had to return it for another package.<br /><br />The booklets dont tell you how to actually use the watch, but instead inform you about how to set it up. The most important part of initial setup, charging it for three hours before use, isnt even included on the front page but several pages back.<br /><br />There seems to be a really high failure rate with these. Garmin support seems very nice but utterly powerless to overcome the poor hardware.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A truly touching film based on a true story.  The original took place in Japan, but this is not an ususual happening.

B000JQU1VS|2.0|I've read \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" in a number of formats including paperbacks and a much beloved two volume annotated edition of all of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and novels in chronological order. In spite of the price this version for the Kindle was a bit disappointing. A huge problem for me was that every time a sum of money was mentioned it was difficult, and sometimes impossible, to determine the correct amount because either there wasn't a symbol for Pounds available or it just didn't transfer properly when it was prepared for the ebook format. It felt as though it was scanned with character recognition software that couldn't read the symbol for Pounds Sterling.<br /><br />Another aspect that I wasn't particularly happy with was that the table of contents had no hyperlinks to the individual stories. I read the book straight through, but there are times when I'd like to revisit a particular story out of order. It's possible to do using search but it would be so much more convenient if linking were available.<br /><br />While all in all this edition delivered what I wanted - the first book of Sherlock Holmes short stories for the bargain price of $0.00 - there were enough problems and annoyances in the transition to the electronic device for me to regrettably regard the presentation of the book as substandard.

Yes, Ozzy does speak about his drug abuse, but, wow, this book is extremely entertaining. I literally laughed out loud on several occasions. Once, I laughed so hard I was brought to tears.   This is one of those rare books that you will have to force yourself to put down. We've all heard about the infamous dove and bat incidents...you'll get the details that you always wanted to know. But more than that, I learned a lot about Ozzy, as well as his former band mates. You'll get a peek inside his \\"normal\\" home life, as well as the rock-n-roll side.  Who knew he had such a great sense of humor? Whether talking about lighting his garden on fire or riding his horse into town, he will tell the story in such a way that you almost feel like you are there, standing behind him, watching the whole thing unfold.   Read this book. You won't be disappointed.

0375842209|4.0|I read this book this past summer and while I remember it being very touching,  the language was atrocious! I would never let anyone read it without blacking out numerous words. The author even has young children in the book saying bad words which, I hope, is totally unrealistic. I can not believe that children around 10 would be saying such words that no one should ever say. If these words are blacked out though it is a good book and it is interesting to experience the holocaust through an un-anti-Semitic, non Jewish young girl.  Furthermore, after reading all the reviews, many people wrote about the wonderful message, but I personally do not see any message in it. I do not really remember the book, but that probably means that it was not as amazing as everyone makes out. It was moving, and I did cry because I cared about the characters. Many also talk about \\"the power of words\\" message in the book, if you want power of words, read Baby by Patricia Maclachlan.   All in all, I think it was a good concept and a good book.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Purchased this CPU to replace my aging Core i7 920. Paired this CPU with the ASUS Extreme-Z motherboard and 16GB of Kingston Hyperx 1600. The word fast is not enough to describe the performance.  A few words on cooling: For the first time in several CPU generations, the Intel stock cooler is not good enough. I hate to generalize that much, but it really does not perform well enough. Details: idle@50-60C, load@80-84C. Pretty terrible. QuickSync push the temperature to the max. In short, if you are EVER going to fully utilize this CPU, buy another cooler. I highly recommend the Zalman CNPS 9900MAX. Overclocked to constant 4.6GHz, the Zalman cooler has me idling at 28C, load < 60C.  Overclocking: 4.6GHz constant overclock at stock voltage. Fully stable under any load scenario. At 4.6GHz, scores over 30000 for CPU in 3Dmark Vantage. Nothing to sneeze at.  QuickSync: WOW!!! Up until now, I've been using a lot of CUDA acceleration for my video transcoding. With the right software and settings, you can get a very good quality/performance balance. Quicksync makes it look like a toy! For testing I used a 1080P HD video file (Astro Boy). With CUDA, I can transcode this file at about doubletime (circa 45 minutes total transcode time). Quicksync finishes the same exact job in under 13 minutes! The quality is better, and it easily triples the performance. Another test showed similar performance increases for a smaller (just under 400MB) file. QuickSync completes that transcode in 2.5 minutes. If you want to edit or transcode videos, this CPU will change your world! Also, if you remember to stick to Z68, Ivy Bridge will be a massive boost (early benchmarks show GPU performance boosted no less than 68%).  Onboard GPU: I can't really speak much to this point. I don't use the onboard video for anything except QuickSync (see: LucidLogix Virtu D mode).  Overall: This is the best processor I have laid my hands on to this day. Yes, they released the 2700K, but that is just a binned 2600K. Could I overclock more? Very likely. I'm very happy with 4.6GHz. I highly recommend this CPU for anyone who wants/needs the horsepower. Just replace the cooler.

B00479SVBU|4.0|I wanted a product that would allow me to bring tons of music on a long road trip without having to carry dozens of CDs, and the minivan we used has a CD stereo system that does not have an auxiliary input.  The Soundfly worked like a champ throughout the trip, and it fulfilled my need to have a lot of music.  My fault was not realizing that the FM sound quality could not possibly match CD sound quality.  This was not a defect of the Soundfly, but an inherent limitation of FM.  This is a very good product.
0743270754|5.0|Genius attracts genius. Doris Kearns Goodwin and Abe Lincoln are two sides of the same coin. Period.  As a self-educating student of human history, reading Doris's detailed account of the lives of Lincoln, Seward, Chase, Bates, and others of their time is like coming face-to-face with what it means to be human. This book is about how circumstances shape human destiny, and how human destiny shapes circumstances. Doris takes us literally into the \\"bedrooms\\" of these remarkable men, as also into their cabinet conclaves, page-by-page revealing how deep-seated childhood dreams, desires, frustrations, etc. etc., and ultimately ambitions, came to play out on a national stage in which the stakes were no less than the destiny of a great people. I can read this fat book ten more times and each time draw deep draughts of fresh inspiration as if from the fountain of life itself.  Here at the end of my first reading of it I can honestly say I feel lucky, humbled, and grateful to be counted a human being on this wonderful planet we call home. Thank you Doris. Your book will echo in eternity.  God bless Abraham Lincoln and Doris Kearns Goodwin to the last generation of humanity.
0307477479|2.0|An old New Yorker cartoon depicts the interior of a bookstore with two clearly marked shelves:  one reads LITERATURE and the other, FICTION, the joke being that these could be considered mutually exclusive categories.  This novel, I'm afraid, belongs in the latter category;  it may think it aspires to literature, but nothing about it suggests either the philosophic or psychological depth, or stylistic ambition, of the best writing.  Another reviewer here says \\"Don't keep reading a book that doesn't soar for you--life is too short,\\"  and I agree, except that I suppose I stubbornly wanted to punish myself for buying the damned thing and was determined to finish it.  Also, I was pursuing an inquiry more interesting than the interwoven stories themselves, i.e., what was it about this novel that made it so unsatisfying?  Why did I want to call it \\"middlebrow?\\"  What about the author's style and/or assumptions about what she was doing were so repugnant to me?  The answers finally coalesced, but are hard to summarize because they involve what is missing as well as what is present.  Present is a glibness about the big themes like love and vocation as well as a relentless need to entertain with a comic-book-like cast of characters and pace of events. The author immplictly feels that all she has to do is sketch a character or situation for it/him to spring to convincing life. Two old biddies on safari?  Sure!  A genocidal dictator? Presto!  In another style of novel, one would not expect or need to be convinced;  the author might be merely winking at us, or using the characters for satiric purposes.  Not so here.    More tellingly, perhaps:  I am reminded of Flannery O'Connor's answer to a student about whether the latter was suited to a career as a writer.  \\"Do you like sentences?\\"  O'Connor asked. Writers need to be in love with the process of writing, beholden to the formation of good sentences and paragraphs, maybe not so obsessive as Flaubert, who might write a single line per day, but still reverential toward language and highly respectful of a reader's time and attention, not to say toward the giants of literary history.  The author here seems totally unaware of great writing, seems unaware that words can \\"soar\\" or transcend or embody or do anything extraordinary at all.  In pursuit of the interlocking structure of lives she has mapped out, she is only glib and slick.  She is not without talent, e.g. an occasional talent for metaphor, but even this she abuses, most of them falling flat.  Missing seems to be the self-critical sense that would recognize the wheat from the chaff.   Many Pulitzer Prizes have been given to merely middlebrow novels, \\"entertaining\\" but forgettable works that had wide appeal; and I might have been forewarned.  But too many professional reviews evaluated \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\\" as if it were a major achievement, or at least didn't attempt to put its accomplishments in perspective with the best literature. In their failure, they failed their profession, I think, not to mention failing to provide a clue for me to avoid this fare.  Even more disheartening is to be reminded of a sad fact:  huge numbers of people are unaware that there is a raft of wonderful, transformative fiction out there, or are incapable of telling the difference, and call this novel \\"brilliant.\\"  It's as if great hordes of people thought rock music inherited the mantle of Mozart and Beethoven. (Wait--they do?)  The best guide is to read a few pages of the novel here at Amazon (while the \\"Look Inside!\\" feature is still in force) and judge for yourself.  If you aren't compelled to read on, stop.  \\"Life,\\" as was said, \\"is too short.\\"
0525423656|4.0|I have been looking forward to this book for, well about a year now.  I wasn't sure how much I was going to like Matched when I first found out what it was about, but it didn't take me long to really get into it.  Cassia and Ky's secret relationship was made so very precious due to the danger they were constantly in.  This was the first dystopian novel that I have read where you get a very clear picture of the government involvement.  I, of course, had read The Hunger Games, but I felt like it was more of an outside view of government.  In Matched, Cassia was fully involved with The Society before she started questioning what was happening around her.  Crossed took this information to the next level and then you get a much bigger view of The Rising.  I found it interesting how all of the characters in this book speculate on who \\"the Pilot\\" is, and what The Rising means each having a different view, different feelings and different expectations.  I have enjoyed finding out more about The Rising.  I can understand Cassia's mental dilemma, in many times she is full on for a rebellion against the society, yet time and time again she refers back to her life in The Society where everything was picked for her; decided for her.  The lack of confusion and chaos - sometimes it's like she has gotten caught up with the ease of such a lifestyle that she forgets that the point is that she is an individual with thoughts and the ability to make decisions, yet once she really thinks about it she desires to have that choice and will fight to get it.    I am becoming less and less of a fan of these love triangle books.  I hate that in my mind I have made a decision, and about 90% of the time my decision is how the story concludes, but I'm starting to hate the wishy/washyness of going between boys.  I understand Zander has always been Cassia's best friend from youth, but I don't still don't like the longing references back to him.  He isn't giving up, and there is a part of her that doesn't give up on him either.  It cannot be both ways, and Cassia, and every other girl in every other book, needs to stop playing with the emotions of these boys.  Especially with this series, isn't there enough action and emotion, danger and storyline to feed these books without throwing in the love triangle??  It is refreshing how innocent the relationship between Cassia and Ky has played out on the pages.  Yes, they kiss a lot, and have their tender moments, but sex is not the only thing on their minds - which has been a consistent theme in many of the books I've read.  It really does come off as innocent and sweet, and leaves you wanting just a touch more.  So I have a few questions, which is natural for being in the middle of a series; but I am wondering if The Rising isn't a bit like The Society in many ways.  Order is needed everywhere, but I'm afraid that they have a big ugly center.  Hopefully I'm wrong, since all of the characters we love are wrapped up in the middle of it all.  I'm hopeful on the Indy/Zander possibility.  I do feel bad for Zander, he does seem to have been delt a bad hand in all of this, so to see him come to some kind of happiness would be wonderful.  But more than that, I really, really, really hope that Cassia stops with the back and forth - and falls in love with one guy - who better be Ky!
B004EPZ084|5.0|Horrible Bosses was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I am sure all of us have had bosses like them at time or another.

B005HSG3VK|1.0|I've bought many many things from Amazon over the years, and this is the first time I've posted a review - that's how much I dislike this product.  No way this is worth $29, much less the $39 that I originally paid.  Looks and feels like something you'd buy for $10 at the discount store.

B000E1NWGO|2.0|Referring to the sonic of this SACD only (not the way it is interpreted...)<br /><br />The transfer to digital here has a sever \\"bleeding\\" to the right. This \\"bleeding\\" has the sound emanating more from the right speaker and only the last sonata (Appassionata - recorded 1963) has more or less the correct balance.<br /><br />Thru-out the whole recording - the piano tone is distorted in the sense that it sounds like it was recorded from behind two curtains not one curtain only...<br />This is not the way a Steinway piano sounds like, not in a large studio and not in a concert hall.<br />For superb piano recording one is advised to turn to (any) Decca recording.<br />Fortunately, we have the same repertoire as on this SACD, made and recorded by Decca, with Radu Lupu (ADD recording).

B005LZLFVC|4.0|As the other reviews have already stated, this is an outstanding album of music that is often reminiscent of early Radiohead. One of Bruce Soord's favorite compositional techniques is to set up a simple riff or verbal phrase and slowly let it unfold into various permutations. Depending on your listening temperament, his songs can either be maddeningly long and repetitious or seductively beautiful. I fall into the latter camp, and it might be because I enjoy the music of Philip Glass, Arvo Part, and Steve Reich - minimalist composers who write tonal pieces that rely upon a lot of repetition.<br /><br />If you aren't sure about purchasing the whole album, try listening to \\"We Subside\\".  If that piques your interest, then go for the instrumental \\"Resident Alien\\". It's too bad the best tracks, \\"Part Zero\\" and \\"Vapour Trails\\" aren't available for mp3 download.<br /><br />The other reviews are all referring to an older edition of Variations On A Dream, so let me mention that the new one just released by KScope is a fantastic bargain. It is very attractively packaged with a special cardboard slipcase over the jewel box. I never owned the original edition, so I don't know if the artwork has been changed or how the mastering compares, but to my ears the sound is excellent. However, the real reason to purchase the KScope edition is the inclusion of Pineapple Thief's limited edition album, \\"Eight Days\\". Recorded over a period of 8 days (surprise), this collection proves that Soord works best under pressure. All of the songs are terrific, rivaling his best work. Getting a 2-disc set for the price of one is a real steal.<br /><br />KScope deserves kudos for rereleasing these out-of-print and hard-to-find Pineapple Thief cds. They have also recently reissued [[ASIN:B003062NFG Little Man]] and [[ASIN:B005D3SX7G 10 Stories Down (2011 Remastered Edition)]].

1451637500|3.0|It's hard for me to believe that there are eight years between \\"Diplomatic Immunity\\" and \\"Cryoburn\\", the last two full novels in the beloved Vorkosigan Saga.  However, having read \\"Cryoburn\\", that gap feels more like a gulf.  The Miles Vorkosigan that stars in this novel is a much different Miles than even the one fans saw in \\"Diplomatic Immunity\\", and even more different than the Miles we've seen in his previous adventures.<br /><br />This Miles is now a full-fledged family man, with his lovely wife, Ekaterin, taking care of their four kids back home on Barrayar.  Miles wants to be home, but he's on the planet Kibou-diani untangling a case of corporate chicanery and greed involving cryogenics patients who will never be revived, thanks to a bad batch of preserving fluid.  Along the way, Miles meets Jin Sato, a young runaway who is fascinated by animals, his sister Nina, and their mother Lisa, who holds the key to the mystery involving the cryogenic corporations vying for their own slice of immortality.<br /><br />It's no surprise that Miles must use his cunning, his diplomatic skills, and his status as Imperial Auditor to get down to the bottom of the scam and reunite Jin and Mina with their mother, to whom Vorlynkin, the Barrayaran counsel to Kibou-diani, takes a bit of a shine.  But it's clear that fatherhood and middle age have tempered Miles, so much so that he fears that he'll be called upon to solve another problem before he makes it back home.  But instead of running point as the Emperor's Voice, Miles - and the reader - take a serious punch to the gut.  That punch is told from five points of view - Miles, Mark, their mother Cordelia (the Vicerine of the planet Sergyar), cousin Ivan Vorpatril, and Emperor Gregor himself, who delivers the last line of the novel.<br /><br />Although \\"Cryoburn\\" is a good novel, it doesn't really give Miles any of the strong familiar characters to play off of.  Roic, the Lord Auditor's muscle and batman, does not provide the kindof byplay that characters like Ivan or Gregor would.  Raven Durona, who was involved in Miles's revival earlier in the series, is there mainly for medical relief.  Counsel Vorlynkin turns out to be the strongest supporting character here - showing the appropriate levels of disbelief, umbrage, and ultimately warmth as he helps the Empire.<br /><br />\\"Cryoburn\\" suffers, too, from the distance it has from the rest of the series.  No doubt, Miles has matured.  But that gut punch I spoke of earlier changes his trajectory.  If it is, indeed, the final novel in the series, it makes a good spot in which to wrap up.  If, however, it is not the end, I hope that Lois McMaster Bujold will not wait another eight years to satisfy the appetites of her fans - of which I am one.

0385534639|5.0|Erin Morgenstern's debut does nothing less than breath fresh air into the fantasy genre (as another off-site reviewer stated, it is a blend of fantasy and magical realism). It is a debut that reminds me of Harry Potter, in that brings the wonder of magic back to forefront and shows the fun that fantasy can offer all readers.<br /><br />The work it most reminds me of is not Harry Potter, however, but rather Big Fish. There is similar feeling to this book, that our world has wonders for those with eyes to see and appreciate them.<br /><br />The Circus and the forces that surround it are powerful but even the villains aren't simple black hat cacklers, and many of the more interesting characters are the grey souled ones.<br /><br />The tents are wonderful creations, islands of wonderful magic described in vignettes that enhance, rather than derail, the pacing of the book.

B005FWO3QK|4.0|... an average of 3.5, so let's call it four stars. Wagnerites assured me that it was the best I could get, though not perfect, so I took the plunge. I watched the whole thing, 11 disks, 15.4 hours. I could have attended the \\"American\\" Ring Cycle recently staged by the San Francisco Opera, or I could have purchased the purportedly \\"feminist\\" Copenhagen Ring production. I have the impression that every devout Wagner fan has a \\"Platonic form\\" of the operas in mind, an ideal production in comparison to which any actual staging will be a delusion or a disappointment. This production from the Bayreuth Festspiele surely can't match anyone's ideal.<br /><br />I've reviewed each of the four operas of the Cycle separately, in more detail.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The Maze Runner is a sure page turner and I bought each subsequent book in the trilogy immediately after finishing the previous one, but one of the biggest flaws of the book is the author's predictability. Thomas is the \\"special\\" protagonist, so naturally anything he desires eventually comes true.<br /><br />The story keeps you going, but at the same time, a lot of things are never explained that I think could and should have been explained. I think it was simply easier for the author to graze over the answering of such questions with the whole memory loss thing so that he wouldn't have to come up with an explanation at all. Mystery box, etc. For instance, we never find out by the end of this book what the point of the Changing is. We don't find out what causes it, whether it's purposely implemented, or what happens to Gally.<br /><br />The death at the end of the book, while tragic, really did not fit very well into the character development up until that point. Whereas the guilt felt afterwards by a particular character was understandable, the impression I got from the novel didn't really match up to the things this character was thinking. I'd rate this at about the quality of the Uglies series.

B0036OS3Q0|5.0|I usually take a size 9.5-10 in shoes but due to other reviews I played it safe and ordered a size 11 for these (I have a wide foot so I thought this would be the best option).  Tried them on with thin socks and they have just enough wiggle room to be a perfect fit with thicker socks.  Very pleased.  As long as they stay waterproof and keep my feet warm and dry they'll be an improvement from my old boots.  I guess we'll find out when it snows - an event I'm not anxious to have happen anytime soon!

B0042QNP2S|5.0|I have a bruder garbage truck with different colors than this one, but overall pretty similar, for my two year old. Found it at a discount store for a lot less and was even hesitant to spend that on a truck. But my son fell in love with it twice in the store so i bought it. Could not have been happier. It didnt come with the trashcans (one of the reasons for the discount) but he doesn't care. This toy is heavily played with every day. When i first got it i didnt think it would last, it looks fragile with lots of little details, but it's held up very nicely for months of daily play now. Super happy and shopping for more Bruder trucks now, European quality!

B000002LOE|4.0|Suddenly emerging as one of the most universally recognizable acts in mainstream rock after years of toiling in relative obscurity in the alternative genre followed by brief appearances within the Top 40 and partial commercial breakthrough, REM's 1991 release \\"Out Of Time\\" catapulted them permanently into the consciousness of popular culture. No real universal points of absolute demarcation can be referenced to pigeonhole REM with one definitive sound when discussing the evolution of the band's musical direction; this is a group that was kind of like Janus, looking forward and backward in order to blend previous strengths with new wrinkles in arrangement and instrumentation. Television and radio stations embraced \\"Out Of Time\\" as a collection of subversively poppy tunes heavily embedded with string arrangements, horns, and keyboard, augmented by the presence of other offbeat instruments, such as harpsichord, pedal steel guitar, congas, and mandolin.   REM produced \\"Out Of Time\\" with Scott Litt, and it's fully amplified, somewhat heavily orchestrated, and displays production values that were burnished to a glossy sheen. The strings first heard on \\"Fables of the Reconstruction\\" during \\"Feeling Gravitys Pull\\" are resurrected and lavishly interspersed throughout; \\"Near Wild Heaven\\", \\"Radio Song\\" \\"Losing My Religion\\",  \\"Low\\" \\"Endgame\\", \\"Shiny Happy People\\", \\"Half A World Away\\", and \\"Texarkana\\" all contain some sort of arrangement, whether up front in the mix or simply serving as another textural element. Having previously employed horns on \\"Fables\\" (\\"Can't Get There From Here\\") and \\"Document\\" (\\"Fireplace\\"), the band punctuates \\"Radio Song\\" with  brassy, call-and-response saxophone blasts, then introduces a wistful flugelhorn passage during \\"Endgame\\". The fluidly progressing percussive rhythms of the piano heard on \\"Murmur\\" (\\"Shaking Through\\") and \\"Reckoning\\" (\\"So. Central Rain\\" and Don't Go Back To Rockville\\") emerge again on \\"Near Wild Heaven\\" and \\"Belong\\" to provide ahopeful buoyancy to each. And the mandolin, serving as the focal point of  \\"Green\\"'s \\"You Are The Everything\\" and included substantively on two other cuts from that CD (\\"Hairshirt\\" and \\"The Wrong Child\\") once again weaves its melodic way through the melancholy \\"Half A World Away\\" in addition to the universally acclaimed \\" Losing My Religion\\".   Most universally recognized as their best known (or at least highest-charting) popular songs outside of the preferences of their long-term fanbase, \\"Losing My Religion\\" and \\"Shiny Happy People\\" were played almost incessantly across the airwaves, and offer an interesting contrast to each other; the former imbued with a sense of wistfulness, in both lyrical and musical arrangement; the latter with a mostly positive, nearly joyous, upbeat vibe. The rest of the tracks on the CD can be aligned more or less respectively with one or the other based on the mood established by the tempo, arrangement, and instrumentation. \\"Near Wild Heaven\\", for example, is one of the definitively effervescent tracks on the CD, and can be grouped with the latter song, while \\"Half A World Away\\", with its expression of plaintive longing, could be included with the former, although stylistic variation ran the spectrum from the heavy, boisterous, faux-funk workout of \\"Radio Song\\" to the sustained explosive, fluidly-strummed, agilely percussive, long-unwinding burn of  \\"Me In Honey\\" to the savagely deliberative pedal steel that infects \\"Country Feedback\\" with a haunting, mournful atmosphere.  And lost in all of the venom that some long-time fans were spewing over REM's advancement of their musical direction toward what was perceived as a widely commercial bearing is the underlying fact that in many ways \\"Out Of Time\\" was a release with country-inflected overtones, and one that was not mutually exclusive of the instrumental elements that contributed so much to the distinctive nature of their earlier sound. It's neither regressive or progressive, but a hybridof sorts instead. While I'll always prefer old school REM, I listen to this CD with a little frequency because it respects its influences while using them to nudge the band to grow their sound further.

B0017DJ3UW|5.0|Please do not be misled by any review that leads you to believe that this album is about \\"booty\\" The album in no way misses nor disrespects what Christmas is all about.  It mixes traditional religious songs with spirited and soulful modern Christmas music.  Mariah's  versions of Silent Night, O Holy Night and Hark the Herlad Angels Sing/Gloria are breath taking traditional versions. Jesus Born On This Day, while not an original classic, has a traditional feel.  Jesus What A Wonderful Child is gospel infused and brings you right inside the church.  And yes, All I Want for Christmas is You and Christmas(Baby Please Come home) are fun, catchy secular Christmas songs.  What is wrong with that?  They are great songs that in no way direspect the true message of Christmas.  This album is a winner. Great job Mariah! Merry Christmas to all!!!
B0038BBA4I|4.0|I'm a huge bluegrass fan (I even play banjo) so I frequently get suggestions from friends to listen to \\"country\\" artists that they have found.  Often these \\"country\\" artists are people like Toby Keith who just sing to pop-rock music about loving an ethnocentric America.  Needless to say, I always take friend recommendations with a grain of salt. My first pass at Sigh No More, I was impressed with the music but not so much the vocals. I gave this album 4 stars because it is awesome, a nice folk rock production but I think they need to add  a female vocalist. I think it would give a great balance to the sound, perhaps someone with a bit of grit to her voice (kind of like Brandi Carlile). All in all, this is a great album with songs that tend to run a course from slow starts to furious banjo picking. If it were possible to give a 3.5 star review I would. I think that the vocals are lacking the same power that the instrumental brings. If Mumford & Sons find a way to balance that I think they would become absolutely awesome!<br /><br />Update: I've had this album for almost a year and I have to say the vocals  have grown on me. i don't find them as lackluster as I did during my first few passes but I still think they need to add a female voice to balance the sound out. I will say that I recently received this album on vinyl and it really lends itself to the medium. It's a regular on my record player I think the only record I have that gets more play time lately is The Lumineers.
B005KQVDH8|4.0|What a just plain fun movie!  A fun tale of being a kid and having dreams and believing in stories before we all get to the point of having to fully face reality.  A little bit Indiana Jones, a little bit fairy tale, a little bit mystery and a little bit teen/pre-teen romance.  Just a fun way to remember a time when life was simpler and much more fun!

B003YCOIFY|5.0|\\"The Greatest Generation\\"...much has been said about that phrase, both in the positive and in the negative.  Band of Brothers shows, from a very bottom up perspective, the human condition during one of the largest events in human history to date.  A very well put together series with obviously a big budget.  From training to the end of WWII in Europe the story focuses on a small group of men that live, eat, sleep, train, fight and some times die together.  Puts into perspective on a very human level how ordinary people deal with life when they are caught in extraordinary circumstances.  I cannot recommend this series enough, especially to the \\"younger\\" generations.

B005KR6NJU|5.0|A very fun pre-movies story about the Old Republic. The movie provides a great deal of background to the films themselves. The movies dives into some of the morals and moral dilemmas faced by not just the characters in the movie but in real life too.  The movies is somewhat focused towards the pre-teen crowd but are pertinent to everyone. I don't know how faithful these stories are to the original vision of Lucas and others but they are very good stories none the less.

Everything else is gravy.  As far as entertainment goes \\"Matrix\\" is great!

B002P7BQQS|5.0|There are several subplots in this episode, all of which are overshadowed by Sheldon's, which is now generally considered the funniest Big Bang Theory moment of the entire run of the show.<br /><br />Sheldon struggles to find an appropriate Christmas gift for Penny. He is angry at Penny because she bought him a Christmas gift. Sheldon now feels he has to reciprocate and go through the trouble of buying something for someone he doesn't really understand, all at the same price of the gift he is about to receive.<br /><br />Sheldon's gift-giving search does not go well. He can't seem to find anything a woman would want in a bath & body shop. Even though they have lotions, bath oils, and soaps, Sheldon sees it as a \\"cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon, and vanilla.\\" Howard picks a gift basket to purchase, but Sheldon stops him. He has no knowledge of what size gift basket to get.<br /><br />Back at the apartment, Raj enters with 3 huge gift baskets, Howard with 2, and Sheldon with a tiny basket. Sheldon's plan is to open Penny's gift to him first, then excuse himself with some \\"gastric trouble,\\" and get the appropriately-priced basket, returning the others later.<br /><br />It's now time for the moment of truth: the exchange of gifts. Sheldon fears what basket he has to give her, but he calms down when he sees Penny only got him a napkin. It seems to be a very mundane gift, until he turns it over and reads, \\"To Sheldon, Live Long and Prosper. Leonard Nimoy.\\"<br /><br />Sheldon is completely, totally, and UTTERLY speechless. Penny got Leonard Nimoy to sign a napkin for him! She apologizes that the napkin is a little dirty because \\"Leonard wiped his mouth on it,\\" but Sheldon practically crys for joy as he shouts, \\"DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS! ALL I NEED IS A HEALTHY OVUM, AND I CAN GROW MY OWN LEONARD NIMOY!!\\"<br /><br />Sheldon goes to get his gift for Penny. He returns with the bath baskets. ALL OF THEM. She's overwhelmed, but he STILL thinks it isn't enough. He goes for broke....AND GIVES PENNY A HUG!<br /><br />Then at the final moment, Leonard smiles and says, \\"It's a Saturnalia miracle!!\\"at the final moment, Leonard smiles and says, \\"It's a Saturnalia miracle!!\\"

B0015DYIH2|2.0|The TWILIGHT phenomenon intrigues me.  I read the first three books a few summers ago, when I discovered that a number of my students were reading them.  I liked the first one - I could understand the attraction of teenage girls to a story about an awkward seventeen-year-old who finds herself in a fantasy romance.  I didn't like the second one, and the third one frustrated and infuriated me.<br /><br />I didn't read BREAKING DAWN until last week, when the movie hit theaters.  I knew what it was about.  I had read the negative reviews.  It didn't really interest me.  But in the end I decided I wanted to finish the series.  I wanted to see for myself what the fans loved, and what the critics reviled.  What I discovered was something very interesting - Stephanie Meyer's series isn't about vampire romance at all!  It's an ugly duckling story about a young girl who steps out of her less-than-perfect skin and becomes . . . well, a super-hero!  Critical reviews here on Amazon accuse Meyer of turning Bella into a \\"Mary Sue,\\" a term used to indicate a character who is a reflection of an author's fantasies (applied mainly to fan fiction, in which amateur writers often see themselves as their heroes and heroines).  \\"BREAKING DAWN reads like it was written by someone else,\\" some have complained.  \\"Everything is too easy,\\" \\"Bella gets everything she wants,\\" and \\"Meyer breaks her own rules.\\"<br /><br />But you know what?  BREAKING DAWN is the real TWILIGHT.  The other books were just the build up to this one (most of which was actually written years ago, just after the first novel was finished).  This is what Meyer wanted to give her readers from the start.  And yes, it's fan fiction.  And yes, Bella is a \\"Mary Sue.\\"  Stephanie Meyer wrote these books based on her own fantasies (she had a dream, she says).  Bella IS Stephanie Meyer.  And what happens in BREAKING DAWN is the culmination of all of Bella's . . . uh, Stephanie's . . .wishes, hopes, and dreams.<br /><br />Let's put it this way:  Bella is an awkward, nervous, weak teenage girl.  She lacks confidence, has little self-esteem, and trips over her own feet.  In other words, she's the epitome of the kind of teenage girl who reads books like these.  And there's hardly a teenage girl on the planet who doesn't feel at least some of what Bella feels.<br /><br />What Bella wants is threefold:  1) she wants the ultimate boyfriend (he's strong, powerful, gorgeous, and immortal), 2) she wants to be eternally beautiful (just think about the number of times she tells herself how unattractive she is compared to the Cullen family, and how freaked out she is that Edward will be forever 17 while she is getting older every second), and 3) she wants to have a super-power (so she will have a purpose as an immortal).  BREAKING DAWN gives her all three of these things.  She marries Edward (the ultimate boyfriend), she becomes a breathtakingly beautiful immortal vampire, and she gets her super-power.  And she gets all three of these things without ever having to give up anything - it's like the kind of fantasy you have when you're falling asleep and dreaming what it would be like to be super rich and married to a movie star and walking down the red carpet at the Academy Awards.<br /><br />Of course nothing much really happens in BREAKING DAWN.  Oh, there's a wedding and a honeymoon (no details, though - such a pity!).  And there's that controversial hybrid baby - Meyer just couldn't get her fantasy to hold together without a baby; she NEEDED that baby, and so Bella needs the baby (even though I doubt many 17-year-old girls are dreaming of motherhood).  And it gives Meyer a good reason to let Bella become a vampire - Edward has to change her, or she would have died.  But the promised ultimate battle between the Cullens and the horrible Volturi . . . well, let's just say it's more than a little anti-climactic.<br /><br />There's a reason for the anti-climax, for the lack of any real threat or conflict in the novel.  BREAKING DAWN isn't about the conflict.  It's about Bella.  It's always been about Bella.  And she's gorgeous now, and she has Edward, and she's super powerful.  So what could go wrong?  Nothing!  Absolutely nothing!  And just like those fantasies we have as we're about to fall asleep eventually dissolve into gossamer mist, so does Meyer's story.  Who cares about the Volturi?  Bella is a super beautiful vampire!  She's perfect.  She's everything every teenage girl wants to be.  Wait, no, that's not it . . . she's everything Stephanie Meyer wants to be.<br /><br />Ultimately, the TWILIGHT series is about the quest to be beautiful, powerful, and loved . . . in that order.  It would have been nice had Bella realized that beauty is only skin deep, or that true love has little to do with how someone looks.  And it would have been more realistic had Bella been forced to give up something for her perfect new life (like her father, or her child, or her werewolf friends).  But this is a fantasy.  It's Stephanie's dream.  And in Stephanie's dream, Bella . . . or Stephanie . . . gets it all.  Is Bella a Mary Sue?  Sure she is.  Who's kidding whom?<br /><br />Bottom line - if you're a diehard Bella-and-Edward fan (I'm talking about you, Twihards!), you'll undoubtedly love this book (hey, you've already read it five times and seen the film at least twice).  If you're looking for more than fantasy fan fiction, you'll probably be bored to death.  I was.  As an adult reader I expect more from my fantasies, I guess.  How old is Stephanie Meyer, anyway?.  It's about Bella.  It's always been about Bella.  And she's gorgeous now, and she has Edward, and she's super powerful.  So what could go wrong?  Nothing!  Absolutely nothing!  And just like those fantasies we have as we're about to fall asleep eventually dissolve into gossamer mist, so does Meyer's story.  Who cares about the Volturi?  Bella is a super beautiful vampire!

B0042J6VUS|2.0|for $6.<br /><br />This thing epitomizes cheap construction. The bracket that holds the phone in place is spring-loaded and must be pulled apart with your hands. This leaves no hands with which to insert the phone into the bracket, so you have to sort of pry/slide the phone in. When I did this, the foam padding inside peeled off.<br /><br />There is definitely an easier way to install the phone into the mounting bracket. Remove the bracket, extend the support arm, fit the phone into the bracket head on, rescrew the bracket back in. Given the problem with this mechanism (below), I don't think this thing is gonna last. I don't want to leave the tripod attached to my phone all the time, just so it will last longer.<br /><br />Pros<br />*very cheap<br />*bracket is removable from tripod<br />*ball head<br />*wide mounting bracket allows for a variety of phones, even with their cases on.<br /><br />Cons<br />*almost completely cheap plastic.

0385535139|4.0|Like most of the reviewers, I'm a Grisham fan.  The Litigators is a solid entry to the Grisham stable of page turners.  What I like in a novel is 1) a good story question and 2) a happy and/or satisfying answer to that story question.  The Litigators has both.  Forget the one or two star reviews.  This book is good fun all the way.  The  characters are interesting and amusing.  The plot has just enough twists to hold your attention without being unbelievable.  This novel is a good effort by a good novelist.  When you finish The Litigators, you'll have a smile on your face.  Go for it.<br />PS  Thanks John Grisham for your Epilogue.  I know the story is supposed to end when it ends, but I usually want a bit more.  You provided it.  Thanks for a good story.
B003Y5H51K|4.0|I didn't have much hope for this film when it came out and I didn't go to the theater to see it in 3D. I should have done so because this is a captivating thriller that pushes a lot of emotional buttons in the audience. Even viewing it at home, I can see clearly that some highly sophisticated cameras where in operation here. This is a human story more so than anything else and a fantastic adventure. I was pretty shocked that the death scenes turned out to be so brutal. This was not because of anything gory or grotesque but because the filmmakers put the viewer into the boots of the characters so well that once someone bites the proverbial bullet, it stings much more than in a typical action thriller where people are dying in every other frame of film.  The character of the father may remind many of their own old man, a no nonsense, go for broke fanatic that keeps his more delicate emotions firmly in check while lashing out in anger whenever someone questions his leadership. His son is one member of the new generation of men, sensitive and spoiled, self-centered and attention seeking. The father-son confrontation of wills was a big part of the backbone of this film. The underwater photography glorious and the set design claustrophobic and unsettling.  There are many other cave movies out there, ( The Cave, The Descent and so on ), and most of them rely on tried and true terrors such as monsters and mutants hiding in the dark and waiting for their victims. What I enjoyed about Sanctum is that it forgoes those cliches in favor of a more classic duel between man and nature. The natural world is remarkably beautiful and profoundly dangerous. I personally am not a big fan of cave exploration myself, preferring to get my adrenaline and adventure in other ways, but Sanctum seems to both summon people to explore and at the same time warn them about the possibilities when things go horribly wrong.   The Australian accents can get a bit difficult to understand sometimes, but that's what subtitles are for. This is a solid film and much better than many other so called thrillers of recent years.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|The 40th Anniversary CD of Aqualung is truly fantastic & highly recommended! The stereo sound stage is wide: throughout the disc you'll hear instrumental passages that were completely buried in all past releases.   The contrast between the acoustic and electric guitar textures is a stunning highlight throughout the disc.    All of that horrible analog tape hiss that has plagued past CD releases has been COMPLETELY eliminated; and though the most critical listener will know that this recording was made in 1971 he will still be impressed with the excellent bass response & the lack of distortion when played at HIGH volume levels.   The excellent quality of the song writing and the stellar musical performances wrapped together now in this extraordinary sonic package places Aqualung 40th Anniversary CD in my top ten list of all time rock albums.   Rock on,   drumming57@yahoo.com

0307891402|3.0|I bought Oblivion's guide, which actually arrived a week before the game arrived, and I really enjoyed it, so I thought I would really enjoy this guide as well.  Well, Skyrim's guide arrived 2 weeks after the game. Not as good, and really not the fault of the guide, but I'm sharing my experience.  The major issue with the guide, though, is the lack of order: you'll have a very hard time finding what you need. For example: When looking for tips on a quest in the index, one quest is labeled 'Daedric Quest: xxxx', the other quest is labeled: 'Radiant quest: xxxx'. The guide has such a long index, why not list how the quest is called, instead of grouping it to different quest types so I'll have to guess whether what I'm stuck at is a radiant quest, a side quest, a miscellaneous objective (that's right, they have a 'miscellaneous objective' category, whatever that is), a dungeon quest, a daedric quest, a certain guild's quest and some quests are just listed in the index for their main item: 'Calcelmo's ring', for example, or simply as the quest's name. Honestly, it's a complete mess. How about simply having a 'Quests' category and that's it?  If searching for a quest's walkthrough in this guide requires actually twice the time to actually run it in youtube, then I think something went terribly wrong here.  The guide is also filled with many inaccuracies which really damage the guide's relevancy. For example: it's written in the guide that Summoned Dremora Lords use a Daedric mace, when they use Daedric Greatsword, or list that the Dremora Lords also use certain spells, which they never do (they may know how to cast those, but if they never do, why list it?). There's also the warning about summoning a bound sword: 'you can't dual cast the spell to get one sword in each hand, you'll have to cast it one hand at a time', which is clearly wrong, as dual casting a bound sword simply creates a sword in each hand. How can I know if the statistics and other 'tips' are accurate ornot if they got even the basic information and tips wrong.  Then there are the not so rare misspell, or the repeating the repeating of certain words of certain words in quite a few paragraphs. In a tome this large I won't hold this against the author, but it is worth pointing out.  I could forgive the inaccuracies and editing issues, but the only reason I bought this guide is to quickly search for tips in certain quests. If I can't do even that properly, then the guide has mostly decorative purposes for me, which is a shame.  In short - yes, this guide looks fantastic, but when looking at its usefulness, either when compared to Oblivion's guide or when judging it on its own merits, the bottom line is that it's not a very good guide, in my opinion.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I admit to being an enormous dog lover, but as many reviews have already stated, it is an incredible simplification to call this a dog book.  Enzo is the limited narrator, who has extensive insight into his family's lives, but still processes things with the simplicity of a dog (or a young child).  It is a fascinating read.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I have been wondering when a show like Dexter would stop me in my tracks and here it is.  I have owned many series and this by far is twisted and delightful.  I love the characters molding to these dark creatures.  The smiles etched on my face just prove that T.V. has not yet died.  I want them to make more of series like this.
B003UESJH4|4.0|Having watched all kinds of BBC docs about all kinds of speech impediments, I am more than aware of the pain (and embarrassment and shame) felt by the sufferers of such conditions. And speech impediments seem to be almost taboo in the entertainment world. although not completely overlooked...Sloth from the Goonies had one. The comedian in Fish Called Wanda had One. There is that black boxer who has a bit of a lisp, isn't there? But I'm digressing.  It doesnt take a psychologist to take one look at the cover of this DVD and know that in this film, Colin Firth (who plays the king who has to say a speech to his friends) does not see his vocal disability as an 'impediment', he sees it more as a 'uniqueness'. He is a proud man,who holds himself with dignity and pride despite his shameful, embarrassing vocal incontinence. However, it DOES take a psychologist to look deeper into Colin 'The King' Firths dark eyes to see that there is also a gnawing insecurity there, a dread of the speech that he knows he'll have to say before the film ends.  That's where the old man in a suit on the left of the DVD cover comes in.  He may not look like much, but he is an incredibly valuable remedy to King Colin's speech problems. He is an old and very quirky man who is speech therapist.   Although the lovable duo dont take an instant liking of eachother due to The King not being able to talk properly, soon the King learns how to talk like normal people, with the support of his therapist, his wife, his country and fundamentally HIMSELF.  A wonderful tale of one man and the probs that he must overcome. I wont spoil the ending, but at the ending when he says his speech and it doesnt sound that bad I was genuinely moved.  Entertaining, interesting camera work and eclectic music. What more could a guy ask for?
B002ECEJ3G|2.0|It was a required read for my college english seminar class on modernity and modernism.  This is because some of the themes and rhetorical devices correlate with modernism I guess, but I found it very boring to read.  Nothing really happens in it.  I don't care how well written it is, or how wel it portrays anything, there was nothing to keep my attention, and I found it hard to read without falling asleep mid page.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful app with great options. Especially good is the beta audio version. This is not a &quot;Talking Moose&quot;  voice, but a genuinely rich, melodic reading. I use it daily.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Pretty fun, but very fun. I got it on the free app of the day so I can't complain. I may not have felt this way if I ended up paying for it.
0439023513|4.0|I read this book immediatly after being hoooked on the first two books and I couldnt put it down.  I love this series; I am not much of a book reader at all, but this book was the icing on the cake.  It shows how one person, no matter where they come from can make a difference for the entire population.  I really love how it twisted toward the end, with Katniss killing the president at snows exicution.  The one thing i wasnt sure about was how Peeta was hijacked but they fixed it in the end with both of them being able to sorta restore their relationship and have kids.  This is a great book and I read it over and over and still get the same feeling everytime.
0670022950|4.0|The first chapters are an impressive collection of statistics and description clearly demonstrating the decrease in violence rates correlated with political development across societies. Clever explanations and interesting anecdotes abound. The book gets weak and long winded when Pinker tries to connect violence with neuroscience and psychology. Nonetheless a very interesting read.
B000050WZY|5.0|Look at the list of songs, what's not to like? All the #1 hits.  Sure there are omissions of great songs that came up a bit short of #1status but look at what is there & in nicely remastered form to boot. While my favorite way of hearing the beatles is sitting down & listening to a nice vinyl copy of any of the original albums from beginning to end, this is my favorite Beatles Cd for listening in my car or using as background music at a gathering. More for fun than deep listening, but that's more than good enough.
0547260695|5.0|The little prince with pop up graphics you can get better than that. I will suggest this book as a present for children 7 and up. Because the story as beautiful as it is is a little long.
1419702203|3.0|I do believe it's a great book but the lack of any mention of Patty Boyd was a huge mistake. I know that she was still in touch with George and even attended Dhani's graduation at Brown (I think, I could mistaken on that). So it seems now he's gone, she's forgotten. After they were together through pretty much of his early career. Is the documentary any different?
0316019984|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest pop-up books I've ever seen. I just had to get it for my nephew since he loves superheroes (and maybe a tad bit for myself, as well.) There's only one thing wrong: whenever you get to the page with the Batman pop-up, the light doesn't work. However, if you leave the plastic tab in the back of the book, turn it to that page, and take the tab out, then it works and goes off after the allotted time. If you leave the tab out without placing it back in the slot and turn to the same page, the light will not work. Not a big deal and maybe it's just that book, but that's really the only complaint I have. It has so much awesome stuff packed in there though, that it's nothing I'm really bothered with. I would definitely recommend this for superhero lovers of any age.
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun! no crashes on archis 101....hints are good..but not give away game...nice resoolition on the tablet, great to pass ime if necc.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I honestly haven't been enthralled by a book in a long time. One of those books that makes you stay up late nights, ignore any plans you were previously engaged to, and curl up with your kindle and go to town. This book, however, is definitely one of those books. If you are looking for \\"horror\\" I would look elsewhere, but if you are looking for more of a psychological, fantasy read, look no further. Riggs takes you on a fascinating journey of the other side of our world, with intoxicating of landscapes, and characters that keep you wanting more (which I cannot wait for the sequel!). It takes you on the journey of a boy named Jason, whom never really fit in.  Intertwining the mystery of his grandfather, that is slowly developed through the entire story.  In the end you are left encapsulated by the story of these \\"peculiar children\\" and their intriguing lives. I would seriously recommend this book to any reader, from young to old. It is really an amazing read and I'm really glad I stumbled upon it on accident.   Oh, and to the user who had issues reading it on Kindle, I have the app on my phone, and I read it on a Kindle, and I personally had no issues reading the hand written notes, or zooming in on the pictures. Just for anyone who was concerned with this as I was.
B003K0TOYU|4.0|\\"Skipping Christmas\\", by John Grisham, is an entertaining holiday tale told in a sure, sly manner. This is the story of how Luther and Nora Krank decide to have a radically different holiday when their daughter leaves home to work for the Peace Corps in Peru. Members of a very close-knit community who enthusiastically partake in all things Christmas, the Kranks meet with much resistance to their getaway plan. They tough it out though, with Luther fighting the good fight and Nora going along for the ride. However, when their daughter Blair suddenly announces that she not only will be home for the holidays, but will bring along her new fiance', the Kranks have to ditch their dream cruise and go into overdrive. Somehow, they must recreate their whole traditional holiday celebrations in an insanely short amount of time. It takes a village to pull it all off, and as grudges give way and fences are mended, the spirit of the season is renewed. \\"Christmas with the Kranks\\", starring Tim Allen as Luther, and Jamie Lee Curtis as Nora, is the film version of \\"Skipping Christmas\\". I very much enjoyed both the book and the film. Tim Allen is a funny guy, and Jamie Lee Curtis has such great heart and appeal. The film stayed very true to the book, which made them both even more enjoyable.
B000YABIQ6|4.0|Heard a lot about this series, so decided to try it out. It is a bit of an acquired taste. The smoking especially, as well as the mysogyny, but that was probably the reason for writing the whole thing. I get the distinct feeling (halfway through season 1) that the show is still trying to find its pace. But I will definitely  get season 2
B003Y74KC0|2.0|I've had this case for about a month - only about 2 weeks after I've gotten my phone.  I don't abuse it or really do more than set it on my desk or in my purse and it already has a tear on the side.  Also, the silicone is a little too stretchy, and falls off the phone at whim.  I give it 2 stars as it's still protected my phone in a couple of drops (and the pink and the pattern are quite cute), but I would not re-buy when this one dies completely.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|grew up playing this so was excited to try it. but crashed 5 times before getting through the menus to actual game play. trackball control is bad and only viewable in portrait mode so too small to really see. crashed during game play so I'm done. uninstall and won't be buying any from this dev. original Droid.
0385342047|4.0|I really, really like this book.  But not as much as the others.  It was a little over the top, and you kind of want Becky to grow up a little bit.  Over all though, it is a fun read, and I always love to read about Becky and her adventures!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the interface and available radar map. The review requires more word than I have to say about this application.
B004FOA84A|4.0|fun but too short. also found it odd to get to the end and &quot;find grandpa&quot;, only to have him say things that imply the game will continue, but then it doesn't. played this on my kindle fire and it worked perfectly
B0018BF1KY|5.0|I have always loved Rory Gallagher since I bought Top Priority.  I just liked the album cover, he looked good.  Anyone willing to put a picture of himself with his guitar, on their cover, is worth a listen and it proved a worthy risk.  It was one of my favorite albums...yes albums.  When I bought it, it was his latest LP and I was just entering high school.  It changed my musical tastes forever!  This 5-CD pack is really a great listen, not to mention a wicked bargain.  it is highly recommended to anyone that listens to music primarily to hear guitar!  Buy it, you won't regret it!
0060531053|5.0|Great conditioned book and very informational.  I just realized that my father-in-law bought the first edition and he is pumped to read this third addition.  Thank you very much for your great shipping.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|I love the martial arts scene in the movie but the human interest part of the movie really makes the movie much more fulfilling.  While the plot line of Chinese versus Japanese or Western invaders have been used thousands of time, Ip Man, the character, represents the ideals of a teacher and role model better than any other character I can think of and you just can't help by root for him.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Before my Kindle Fire arrived, I presumed I would be running Pocket Informant to manage my schedule.  (Indeed, one of my main reasons for buying the Fire was to have a larger view of my calendar.)  Although Pocket Informant is available for Android, it is incompataible with the Fire.  (From webis support: \\"Since the Kindle Fire doesn't have a native Android calendar, PIA as it is will not work on that device. There has been some discussion about direct sync to Google in a future version for other reasons, but direct sync to Google will not be available until after v2.0 is released.\\")  CalenGoo came to the rescue.  The synchronization is perfect. (If you use 2-step verification for your Google account, you will need to use an application-specific password.  But if you use 2-step verification, you know this is no big deal.)  Even the colors you use for your Google calendars are reproduced in CalenGoo.  Several views are available, of which I find the \\"landscape day\\" and \\"agenda\\" views the most useful.  One side effect of the missing Android calendar on the Fire was that times in the \\"agenda\\" view would not display in 24-hour format.  An email to the developer generated a prompt and helpful response.  There was was a work-around in the next release, which was only a week later.  In summary: a great app with great support that address a major gap on the Kindle Fire.  CalenGoo is worth every penny.
B0061S073A|1.0|Where do I start.  The interface - bright orange background with no ability to change it.  Yuck.  And it crashed repeatedly within the 10 minutes I attempted to use it on my Fire.  No thanks.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like the graphics<br />I like the foremat<br />I like the detail<br />This app works well for me, fitts my needs
B005HSG3VK|4.0|At first, I had mixed feelings about this case because of all the bad reviews. I had a hard time picking out which case I wanted. But finally decided to get this one. It came in today, and I really like it! It's sturdy, light, and the I love the pink color! I would recommend this product to anyone!!
B000P1QMZ6|5.0|We have been searching for the first \\"Harry Potter\\" but did not want \\"The Sorcerer's Stone,\\" rather \\"The Philosopher's Stone.\\"  Being an European title we could not find it in the states.  Amazon.com had it used for a decent price, shipping was early and the movie is in tip-top shape.  Thank you
B00009AQMJ|5.0|Rachmaninoff, in his-famous recordings w/Stokowski and others, could hardly match THIS partnership, in many aspects. The \\"old\\" Russian (from Kiev) - Horenstein - was in his LATER years, but he and the Orchestra are exceptional. This is one of the GREAT Concerto cycles, of any composer, of any time. There's hardly a note, nor phrase, that could be-changed ... and Earl Wild shows, BOTH, a technical brilliance, AND a subtle/modulated touch, when and where it's needed. Overall, this 45-year-old recording should be KNOWN, as one of the best of ALL, of any type, in classical pianism, with Orchestra.
B004LWZW88|5.0|I admit that I went to see this movie somewhat reluctantly and came away a fan. I totally loved the film! The animation is superb, as are the voiceovers, with Antonio Banderas definitely making Puss in Boots a character I would like to see more of in the future.<br /><br />The storyline is intricate but compelling, vividly weaving together a myriad of nursery rhyme characters  into the plot, which is filled with fun and adventure. It also tells the viewer about the origins of Puss in Boots. While this historical perspective may not have much to do with the original Puss in Boots of the classic French fairy tale, somehow it all works.<br /><br />This is simply a terrific animated film that is fun for the whole family.  Those who are cat lovers will particularly love this film. It is the cat's meow!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This weather app meets my weather needs. The graphics are most relevant as far as weather apps go. The designers took the needs of users in mind when they created this app.
145551389X|5.0|This book is honestly a gateway to her life. You see gaga like never before. Not only that but the beauty in the pictures are overwhelming!
0385535139|4.0|Just finished the Kindle edition. I'm happy (ecstatic?) to report that John Grisham is very much alive and well! Incredibly, he delivered his marvelous magic again. Why am I saying incredibly? Because he still has as much punch as in The Firm. That's outstanding after so many years of success. John has not lost his touch.
B00457WZEI|5.0|A moving story that conveys the dignity of humanity even in the evil of war as told by Joey, the war horse.  Despite the cruelties and senseless suffering caused by men against men in the \\"great war,\\" Joey never loses his sense of faith in humanity.  He is an eyewitness to perhaps the greatest evil perpetrated and yet holds out hope in the close fellowship he finds with those caught up with him in the struggle to survive in great suffering.  Very moving and sure to tug the heart strings of any reader.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|The kindle version costs more than the hardcover version. Given the publisher savings on production and distribution this is quite the rip off!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|easy set up and within a minute I was accessing my computer from my fire and watching a video. awesome.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Amazom Prime does it again.<br />I could not pass up this deal on Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison.<br />Shopping From Home Does Not Get Any Better Than This.<br />Thanks Amazon PRIME<br />M.A.FLICK
B000002L61|4.0|Gotta like this 1984 album by the late great Ronnie James Dio; it's filled with cool heavy metal numbers such as WE ROCK, THE LAST IN LINE, and I SPEED AT NIGHT, while featuring the more melodic MYSTERY. Dio leaves nothing in the bag with these great songs. It's interesting to note that Dio is known for slow articulate intros to songs. He's a master of either building momentum in a song, or blasting out of a melancholy intro; such is the case in songs like INVISIBLE (from Holy Diver) and THE LAST IN LINE. I really feel that this album is in the shadow of its predecessor, Holy Diver, but manages to really deliver quality heavy metal that's also intellectual. Of course, Ronnie has the best pipes for his genre, too. I recommend this album as one of the better heavy metal releases of all time. 8.5/10
B00080ZG10|5.0|We added this movie to our family collection.<br />We enjoyed this film on the Big screen and now we can enjoy it at home.<br />Thanks to Amazon Prime and FREE SHIPPING.<br />Shopping from home does not get any better that Amazom Prime.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|It's beginning to look a lot like christmas! At least it is thanks to Michael Bublé. His voice and song choices take you back to traditional songs but the recordings are crisp and full sounding. A great xmas album that everyone should buy and play every year during the holidays. :)
B005NJ2K6U|3.0|I loved the first Gem Spinner and I love this one even more. Lots of great new features and upgrades that make this version better than the first one.<br />Unfortunately it does crash my Galaxy S phone, not cool.<br />It does have, like 40 puzzles but it still isn't nearly as many as the first version, so it ends up feeling too short.<br />It is a really well done game though and I'm hoping for an update that deserves 5 stars!
145551389X|5.0|Even though I don't have the book yet I will be getting it soon for Christmas. I saw some pictures from the book on Facebook and I was awestruck. Gaga is a sexy beast and will always be. She blows my mind!!!!!! Paws Up for Mother Monster!!!!!!
B004EPYZT4|4.0|Might even like it better than the original...is quite a good film.  Great pictography and Conan is awesome!  Supporting cast is good too!  I recommend!!!
B003UESJH4|5.0|Unlike one of the reviewers who brutally attacked the film as being shallow and boring, I found it very interesting and full of facts that many people are not aware of concerning the life of anyone in the monarchy of England.  It isn't that I find that having a monarchy a necessary thing, however, that said, there are many things that the rest of the population isn't aware of that go on in the life of anyone who happens to be born into that life.  It isn't all glamor and luxury, as it appears from the outside, these people often live very unhappy lives, because they are loyal to the duties that are placed upon them from birth.  No, I am not from England, I just am very empathetic with anyone in a position of power and what the responsibility entails, especially when as in England, the position isn't always sought after, as was the case with King Edward VI.  And no, the things that he speaks of during his childhood, that clearly caused his stammering, are NOT  irrelevant.  they illustrate my very point.  Like the monarchy or anything about it or not, you can at least take from the film, an example of what any ordinary person may go through who has had similar problems growing up.  I personally know someone who has a speech impediment caused by child abuse.  It has affected him his entire life.  But back to the film, I found Colin Firth to be very effective in his roll as the speech therapist.  He was likable and believable and an interesting personality.  I found Geoffrey Rush to be a very compelling character.  I liked him very much and he was entirely believable in his personality and his interaction with the speech therapist.  Not too touchy feely, as hollywood likes to get with these kind of parts.  That would have been entirely unbelievable in this setting.  Helena Bonham Carter was also good in her roll as the kings wife.  It illustrates that not all in the royal circle are stuffy and stiff.   The film is a true story, which I especially like to watch, in thisday of make believe and so much fluff and no substance or anything of any value to say at all.  This story, outlines a very important time in world history, the dawning of WWII.  It does this very briefly, but never the less, it adds to the weight of the entire story, of a man thrust into the roll of King, in a country who played a crucial roll in whipping the Nazis ass.  No this fact is not part of the film, it is just something you think about after seeing the end of the story.    All in all, I found the story, the people and the way it was put together, to be of excellent quality.  Bravo!!!!!!!
B005HI7NP0|5.0|Just...  DAMN.  They don't make 'em like this anymore.  Run, don't walk, to get this -- if you like old-school 70s soul/R&B & you don't get this album, it's because you're self-loathing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire and this keeps my addiction up and running. I don't understand the choice of getting a random deal or a winning deal but the games go pretty quick so you can get a lot of game time in.
B00318COS4|5.0|This is one great solving game. The animation is just awesome! No words are spoken but only bubble picture images and background music. Not a very long game, but worth the money, if not, just for the visual aspects of the game and that it's DRM free! I heard this was all hand drawn, and what a talent to the person that did it. There are some puzzles that are a bit difficult but can still be solved since it comes with a book that follows the story and tells you the clues. (I believe that the booklet comes only with the collector's edition). I personally don't like using the booklet but if it's a tough puzzle then I do take a peek.  Can be played on a PC (OS: Windows® XP, Vista, Win 7: 1.8 Ghz. Processor: 1 GB Ram of memory: 380 MB of Free hard drive space) and Mac (OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later/1 GIG of Memory/Intel Mac 1.8 Ghz. Processor)  Once installed, you don't need the CD to play this game. I bought it off amazon, the UK version.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Product is very well constructed and is exactly what I wanted for my Fire.  It is a light weight case but not too light.  The color is more of fuschia pink which was a very pleasant surprise.  I was afraid it was going to be too light of a pink.  It is a bright pink.  Very functional without being too fancy, really just a nice hard cover.  It is a little pricey but worth it to me to protect my fire and make it easy to carry.  Would recommend it to you if you want a very functional, cute case.
0307474275|5.0|WHen I read I like to escape. That's what this book did for me. It was fasted paced, intelligent, thrilling and totally entertaining. I can see why it is THEE best seller and incredible movie. This is what fiction is all about. Dan Brown is a master story teller and I thank him.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|This is a good film that tells what happened to the future Earth that the astronauts discovered in those Planet of the Apes films.  It is so superior to the low-budget knockoffs that followed the original (truly excellent) film of the late 1960s that it is not worth going into.<br /><br />The story involves some scientists who are experimenting with the genetics that influence intelligence.  They are naive, full of ideals, and cannot fathom that there can be consequences - often from accidents - that lead into wholly unforeseen directions.  Of course, a corporation without morals is involved.  The young scientist is a good man, trying to help his father who is suffering from slow-onset dementia and caring for an ape who resulted from his experiments on its mother.  Even though I knew what would happen more or less, I completely believed the film while I watched it.  The special effects are also excellent, with CGI apes for the most part, who seem extremely real and ever more human-like.<br /><br />Recommended.  It is very fun.
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I had apprehensions while waiting for the HBO miniseries of George R.R. Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\" to debut last winter, as it seemed to take forever like the winters of Westeros.  But it did finally air and most of my worries were alleviated with a few exceptions.  But I never expect a film version of a great novel to equal the reading experience and usually there are great liberties taken with the story as it goes from print to visual images.  The \\"Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy, while very good, altered the story quite a bit. Not so much in this case.  I found the characterizations to be nearly spot on.  I was concerned at first that some of the sex scenes and regular nudity in most episodes was gratuitous and distracting from the story, but I understand why this was done.  This is, after all, a product that must be popular to be sold.  Hopefully this will assist in getting many more seasons from book to film.  Most of the altering of the story didn't change the story itself but were done for the sake of time and budget I'm sure.  I pre-ordered the first season as soon as it was listed on Amazon.com.  I suppose the overlong wait has a lot to do with the coming second season to tie it in for sales sake. The HBO website indicates there will be a bonus disc included.  HBO along with AMC has the lion's share of the great original programming currently available so at least we have the 2nd season of \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" to feed my hunger for exceptional dramatic entertainment on the home screens.  I just hope that Mr. Martin will continue giving his personal attention to the creation of the film versions of his highly entertaining books.  I won't be a spoiler, but if you were upset by the death of Lord Eddard Stark, be prepared for more of the same. It will be a shame if it is allowed to slide like some other series (no names)have experienced. But it's really a shame we've had to wait soooo long for the home videos to arrive as Winter is indeed Coming!  At least in the great Midwest. By the way, this would make a great holiday gift to the fantasy buff on your list.  Happy Holidays!
1451648537|5.0|I found this book a great read. Understanding Steve Jobs and his life's journey from growing up in California to his resignation from Apple, is very educational. A true entrepreneur with his ability to see future business opportunities, lead product groups to develop great products with \\"A\\" players, and build a moat around Apple to protect it from competitive products.   As with most entrepreneurs, there were a lot of of failures but after the failure, the critical question is \\"What is next?\\". Steve Jobs always found a way to recover, move in a new direction learning from his past failure with control and leverage always at the center of his business decisions.  One of the interesting parts of the book was the final meeting between Bill Gates and Steve Jobs just a few months before Steve died. Get it, you will like it.
6305127697|3.0|Primal Fear, 1996 film  \\"Every defendant has the right to a good defense.\\" We see views of Chicago at night. The lawyer Marty Vale attends a dinner party for the Archbishop of Chicago. The lawyer makes a deal for an \\"alleged\\" bad guy. His client tells about official corruption, an offer to testify against a local politician. Elsewhere a window is broken in a fight. The fugitive is pursued. A 19-year old is arrested for murder. Marty rushes to offer help. [Publicity is a benefit.] The accused tells how he met the archbishop on the street. \\"That was nice of him.\\" Who else was in the room? Aaron Stampler blacked out. Marty begins his defense by investigating the case and his client. The DA wants the death penalty. There is an initial court hearing. The investigator sees Aaron's rented room, and learns more. Alex has a temper. Who is Linda? A doctor interviews Aaron on videotape in jail.  The judge allows the gory photographs in as evidence over Marty's objection. The doctor questions Aaron. Marty looks into the archbishop's charities and recognizes a name. The land there belongs to a charity, they want to develop it and throw people out of their homes. Is there a hidden scandal that may come out? The trial begins. Lawyer Vale pushes the idea of a third person who was present. \\"B32-156\\" is a reference to \\"The Scarlet Letter\\". Vale and his investigator find a man, he knows about Linda and tells of home movies. Vale finds a video tape and views it. Then he visits Aaron and sees a change in his personality! We learn who did it. The doctor observes this. \\"He really did it.\\" Is it too late for an insanity defense? Vale believes in the goodness of people, but sometimes they do bad things.  \\"What are you going to do, Marty?\\" Vale must save Aaron's life. Can they get the tape admitted into the trial? \\"Of course!\\" The Prosecutor isn't fooled by this. The DA tells her to destroy the tape, as he did. Defender Vale summon DA John Shaughnessy to the witness stand, and ask him abouta bankrupt development corporation. Does her recall any allegations against Archbishop Rushman that were covered-up? The judge declares Vale in contempt and fines him $10,000! The doctor testified about a \\"multiple personality disorder\\". The Prosecutor questions the doctor about whether there is corroboration. Vale questions Aaron about his relationships. \\"He did everything for me.\\" Prosecutor Venable then questions Aaron. Was he forced to do it? Roy reacts to the questions. The judge will dismiss the jury and hold a bench trial. She will not rescind the fine for contempt. Was justice done? Did Vale use Venable? Will there be a happy ending for them?  Aaron blacked out, he will be sent to a hospital. \\"Tell Miss Venable I'm sorry.\\" (!) Vale catches him in a lie. Attorney-client privilege: Aaron tells why they can't find Linda. He also tells about Roy. And so it ends. Can an experienced lawyer be fooled by a client? It would not be surprising and dramatic without this ending. [There are some faults. The stabbing frenzy suggests a rejected lover rather than the result of a videotaped encounter. A clever Aaron wouldn't say he was sorry about the Prosecutor. And how did a 19-year old learn so much to fake his character?  This is a clever story that touches on subjects but then avoids them. Corruption in Chicago? Confiscating property under eminent domain to sell it to a millionaire developer? A churchman who sexually abuses children? The seeming ethical lapses of a lawyer who defends by all means?
0316067601|4.0|I thank Mark Luttrell for his service (as an ex-serviceman myself) and bravery and of course I am devastated by the loss of life on the mission.  However the book is not terribly well written, and I expect that is due to the co-author who likely wrote most of this book from verbal descriptions from Mr. Luttrell.  However it is a moderately enjoyable book, I guess my expectations were too high.  The story itself, is gripping, just not well written, and deserved a better writer/editor.  Still I will recommend this book with some reservations.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've never been much of a game player online or on Xbox, PS, etc.  BUT, that has all changed with this game.  It is totally addicting!  When I get stumped by a level, I experiment with which area of the puzzle has the best chance of allowing me to successfully complete it. It does use the resources though, so watch your battery!  Never thought I would have this much fun with my Kindle Fire!!

B005IZLPMY|5.0|I had low expectations for this movie, not sure why, maybe because I doubted that such a great comic book character could be transferred successfully to the big screen. But I was mistaken, this was a great movie.<br /><br />I loved the Red Skull character (I can't get Agent Smith out of my head every time I see that guy in a movie), he was just classic.<br /><br />The special effects were very well done (although the battles were a bit campy, nothing realistic at all like \\"Saving Private Rayan\\" or \\"Band of Brothers\\") but fit the movie's tone well.<br /><br />The storyline was very good, acting was also good.<br /><br />The best part for me was the last line in the movie. It was too classic. What a way to end the movie, better than \\"Iron Man\\" when Stark says, \\"Yes, I am Iron Man.\\"<br /><br />The picture and sound quality were five star.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter Morgan is good at his day job, that of a blood spatter analyst in Miami PD's forensics unit. But he's bloody brilliant at his other job, the one where he gets to murder. Whatever effed up sitch it was that caused Dexter's amnesia regarding his early childhood, it's left him dead inside, an empty shell, a calculating cold fish. He co-exists with something he calls a \\"Dark Passenger,\\" essentially this urge that compels him to kill and kill. Recognizing the predatory beast inside Dex, his ex-cop foster father, Harry (James Remar), took the boy under his wing, reoriented his twisted appetites to a more productive cause. He instilled in Dex an elaborate code of ethics, taught him to target only other serial killers. He taught Dexter how not to get caught, how to blend in. Dads are awesome. And Dexter has steadfastly abided by the Code of Harry. His kills have been righteous kills.<br /><br />This Showtime adaptation is based on Jeff Lindsay's riveting series of books, and if you haven't read them, well, what's the hold up? Dexter Morgan is so emotionally detached he makes Dr. Temperance Brennan seem positively warm and cuddly. Social cues to which we effortlessly respond are baffling puzzles for him. Perversely, there is something innately likable about Dexter. Michael C. Hall plays him with stunning complexity. It helps that, like in BURN NOTICE, we're privy to his inner musings. Dexter is often humorous and whimsical. The girlfriend (Julie Benz) he pretends to care for doesn't suspect a thing. Even Dexter's jittery, potty-mouthed cop sister, Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), doesn't have an inkling.<br /><br />DEXTER THE FIRST SEASON hooks you in straight away as Dexter finds his bragging rights as Miami's resident monster challenged by an innovative fellow serial killer whom the press eventually dubs the Ice Truck Killer. It's an edgy cat-and-mouse game that would span the entire season and cause Dexter to ask serious questions of himself. The lovely twist is that Dexter accepts the Ice Truck Killer's tauntings with glee, perhaps like calling to like. For Dexter, it's an opportunity to play with someone just like him. Never mind that it's readily apparent that this rival knows everything about Dexter Morgan. Dexter shrugs this off. He's having fun.<br /><br />The Ice Truck Killer's modus operandi is eye-catching. He drains his victims completely of their blood and he freezes the corpses, amputates their limbs to a precise measurement. It's fun - and creepy - watching Dexter try to contain his excitement as each perfect frozen body part surfaces, each bit a gauntlet thrown in Dexter's mug.<br /><br />Most each episode also features a \\"serial killer of the week\\" motif, some heinous repeat murderer targeted and eventually carved up by Dexter, and these lesser villains are required so that we don't lose faith in Dex as a badasss dude, given his inability to track down the elusive Ice Truck Killer. It's a pretty good supporting cast, too. It wasn't long before I was keen into what these other characters were up to. Jennifer Carpenter is my second favorite actor on this show. She is one sexy, combustible, never-stop-cussing cop chick. But I do question her instincts. She's Miami PD - an ex-Vice, newly minted Homicide Detective - and yet in all these years she hasn't caught a whiff of her adopted brother's true nature? And then she does something else which ends up absolutely mortifying. And then there's Erik King whose angry, loose cannon character, Sgt. Doakes, is the only one who gets the heebie jeebies from Dexter. Doakes bullies Dexter so much, I sort of wish Dexter would just disregard the Code of Harry for once. Except that Dexter remains as cool as the other side of the pillow. He's a monster who's got his priorities straight. You need to not miss this show. It's wicked funny, cleverly written, and terrifically acted (especially by Michael C. Hall). Rife with moral ambivalence, DEXTER rewards its audience with unexpected - and frequently unsettling - moments. And you're hooked before you know it.<br /><br />The DVD set's bonus features:<br /><br />- 2 Audio Commentaries by the Cast & Producers: \\"Return to Sender\\" (with Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas, Lauren Velez, and Erik King) and \\"Born Free\\" (with producers Sara Coleton, Clyde Philips, & Daniel Cerone)<br />- \\"The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course\\"<br />- \\"Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation\\" - feature on a real-life police investigation in 2001 with particulars on blood spatter analysis<br />- 2 Free Episodes of Showtime's Hit series BROTHERHOOD<br />- A computer-compatible function which allows you to stream two episodes of THE TUDORS, to read the First 2 Chapters of Jeff Lindsay's newest novel DEXTER IN THE DARK, and play the newest CSI Video Game \\"CSI: HARD EVIDENCE\\"<br />- Cast Biographiesrequently unsettling - moments.

0064407667|5.0|As a matter of taste, this book is not for everybody. As the author plainly writes, those searching for a happy ending will be disappointed. Written in a style that is easy enough for late elementary or early middle school, the book obviously found an audience. Still, it is the wry sense of humor that attracts the older crowd.  The Baudelaire children are in a desperate situation when a fire consumes both their parents and their home. By their parents' will, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are given to the custody of their relative in the closest proximty. The mysterious Count Olaf is hardly child-friendly and soon reveals his true motives. He seeks possession of the Baudelaire fortune which can only be accessed when the eldest comes of age. In the mean time, he intends to use the children as servants catering to his miscellaneous needs. That is, until he unleashes a plot to expedite his acquiring the fortune.  Help comes in the form of their new neighbor Judge Strauss and the often oblivious Mr. Poe. In the big pitcure, the solution comes down to the superior intellect of the Baudelaire children. Violet and Klaus come to the defense of the infant Sunny. And while a solution is reached for the current problem, do not expect a happy ending.
B002OSY2T6|2.0|Our 10 month old rarely even acknowledges this toy...unless the dogs are chasing it. Not much bang for the buck. And as for crawling along with it- never happened.  After I posted this review, the snail enjoyed a surge in popularity for several weeks! Go figure!
B0052GVGYG|5.0|The first time I ever heard Susan Tedeschi, I was completely blown away! She reached inside my soul and gave my heart a rip! Oh, baby! Somewhere up there sister Janis Joplin is green with envy, and I know Bonnie Raitt is too. Susan is in the pocket everytime she opens her mouth to sing. And I know her guitar playing as well. It's sweet and blue, crying like a little bird. Then comes along Derek Trucks and his slide... are you kidding me?! Like he doesn't do enough? When the two of them get together on Revelator, I got to go lay down before I pass out. And they have a kickass band! Everyone is a virtuoso on his instrument, and I love the horn section...you know what's coming, but you can't believe it, it sounds so good. If this is too much of a good thing...then I want more! My favorite tune on the album is \\"These Walls\\" because the sitar-like sounds of the sarod harken me back to the 60's, and it works well in blues! I am sold.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|I think too many of you guys are complaining on things that this item clearly states it might or might not do....this cable was made for the ipad2 to enable true mirroring via HDMI, yet still, consumers are ranting about it's disability to work as it does with the ipad2 on he iPad1 and iPhone 4 as well...NO!!!!  This cable is of high quality with regards to it's build (typical apple standard) and gives he impression of extreme durability...can't see how this thing can break on average to heavy use...unless you treat your stuff poorly.   It's a very useful addition to the already \\"great as is\\" ipad2. It in fact opens a whole new world of things you can do with your magical iProduct...the ability to amplify what you see on a 9.7\\" screen to 32\\", 40\\", 42\\", 46\\", 55\\" etc etc...WITHOUT losing as much quality as you probably think you'll be losing is really something amazing..  Overall this item is a bit pricey but you should know that with any OEM apple product you're not only paying for the brand...but also for the superb quality...gave this cable 4 stars only because I really believe it sould be priced around $5 less than it's advertised price but otherwise at the current price...it's a definite must have for any ipad2 owner ;)
B0063IH60K|4.0|The free app has been problem and bug free. It's as much as I'd expect from a paid-for game, and I'm pleasantly surprised.
B001FB55LC|5.0|Anyone who has served in the military and cheated death understands that you change.  Experiencing the violent death of one or more military friends changes you at a deeper level still.  Long after one's service ends, even those who bear no physical scars often carry with them some degree of psychological trauma from coping with the possibility of death on a daily basis.  It is for that reason alone I honor and respect every military member, police officer, fire fighter, search and rescue person I meet because I know the sacrifices they make for each of us they serve.    When serving I never feared death.  What I feared most was the vision of my wife hearing the doorbell and seeing the base chaplain with a command officer at his side standing on the porch.  Thankfully, that never happened but the movie offered the most incredible example I've ever seen in film of what I feared the most.   Brothers presents so many levels of the impact of military PTSD, not only on the military member but also his family.  The acting by the entire cast was perfect.  The story, though possibly a little slow for some, was paced beautifully to allow the viewer to experience an entire range of emotions and expectations before each scene's finale.  By the end of the movie I was emotionally drained and cinematically satisfied.  The word \\"wow\\" was all I could utter.
0385344325|4.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I've read most, if not all of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books. It is interesting to get more detailed information about what led to Reacher's nomadic avenging angel existence--although much of it is alluded to in the other books. The formula is a familiar one. Reacher in a small town, where powerful forces are overwhelming people in need of a white night. One of the things that appeals to many of us in Reacher's character is his unambiguous dedication to setting things right---making sure evil-doers are punished and the exploited are avenged. There is never any grey areas in Child's stories. Right is right and wrong is wrong. With the possible exception of Reacher himself. In this book, much more than the others, Reacher acts as judge, jury and executioner. There is a very justifiable reason, based on the plot line Child lays out, but still it's somewhat disconcerting. Embarking on vigilante justice is a slippery slope and seeing it in action makes me squirm a little. So why don't I rate this book as highly as some of the other Reacher novels? I have some trouble pinning it down, but it just didn't feel like Child at the top of his game. The dialogue wasn't quite as memorable, the plot line a little too predictable, the ending a little too abrupt. But still, it's a good read, well worth the time of aficionados or soon to be aficionados.
140053271X|5.0|It's best to buy this device directly from Barnes & Noble, either the store or the website.  I know Amazon won't let me list prices, but at the time I'm writing this the current \\"list price\\" is 40% higher than the actual in-store price.  Even with Amazon's current discount, it's higher.  Buying at the store also gives you the opportunity to purchase the extended warranty, which protects your NOOK from drops and liquid spills, etc, for two years.  You can take it directly into a store to get it fixed, you don't have to mail it out to Amazon or anything.<br /><br />Otherwise this is a fantastic little e-reader.  The interface is incredibly Simple(ha) and the e-ink is easy to read.  You can change text size to make any book a large-print book, and buying books through Wi-Fi is a snap.  Barnes & Noble also frequently runs NOOK promotions in the store - just recently there was a coupon for a free box of Godiva Chocolates for NOOK owners.<br /><br />Just sayin'.  :)

B005IGDW24|1.0|1st, this is a PRODUCT review, ONLY.  Why is there not a 3D edition, which includes the \\"Christmas Carol\\" mini-movie!?? (or the other special features included in the non-3D Blu-Ray edition??)  Why are there TWO blu-ray discs (the movie & more special features) on the STANDARD Blu-Ray release... but NOT for the 3D release???  More importantly, WHY, are these Dummies making us pay for STANDARD DVDS!?  HELLO, WE UPGRADED TO BLU-RAY FOR A REASON!  Why, habitually, stick the Consumer, with something they DO NOT WANT... give us NO  NON-DVD-included & therefore slightly Cheaper alternative; and then slap us in the face a second time by forcing us to choose either the 2D Blu-Ray w/ more features & \\"mini-movie\\", or the superior-watching-experience of the 3D Version with LESS features & NO \\"Christmas Carol movie\\", which HELLO, is why people are upgrading to 3D-TVs!  I'm so sick of this entire Industry. I've refused to buy past releases which had Theatrical 3D screenings; but which were not given 3D Blu-Ray releases... because I knew (and have been proven right, again & again), that if I just waited 2-6 Months, they'd FINALLY release the movie in Blu-Ray 3D... thus showing, with my purchase (and initial, failure to purchase) what these idiots should be doing, and that I, and many others, were tired of this \\"Edition\\" game.  Now, these LOSERS, have formulated yet another way, to SCREW THE CONSUMER. Fantastic, way to go, ladies & gentlemen.. you must be exceptionally proud of yourselves. Would you like me to just mail you my wallet & let you decide what I should purchase?... because clearly you've ignored the masses who wait to buy the 3D releases when they're initially withheld... and you've clearly ignored the Millions (if not Billions) of ticked-off customer-reviews, critic-blogs, and so forth, over the last 2 or 3 years (longer, if you take out the 3D element).... clearly, you know better than we do, what we want and when we want it.  So, I guess I'll do the only thing I'm left with doing at this point... buy the superior movie-watching-experience edition (ie, 3D)... and hope I can borrow, rent, or download it.  Congratulations... instead of making a satisfied customer, you've made a ticked-off customer, who has to download your content (from one of the countless 'share' sites)... when I'd GLADLY, GLADLY mind you, have had THAT 2nd Blu-Ray disc w/ the mini-movie & extra features, in my 3D Edition, instead of an unwanted, lesser-quality, DVD disc, which always either gets tossed, or given away... and PERHAPS, would've even Gladly paid $1 extra, to have that substitution available as an option!  And you Industry-Dopes wonder why so many people PIRATE YOUR MOVIES / CONTENT / ETC!... Hello!... they're tired of NOT getting their money's worth... they're TIRED of the \\"ultimate\\"/\\"deluxe\\"/\\"collector\\"/etc. Edition-Game.... and they're TIRED of YOU, telling them what they want, instead of EARNING our business, like any GOOD / NORMAL, business would do.    (PS: every time someone gives away, or sells, those Unwanted DVDs in your IDIOTIC \\"combo-packs\\", that's 1 Regular-DVD-Release SALE which you LOSE... Duh!... and again, I ask, how is it, you still wonder, and ponder over the dilemma, of how to increase sales & decrease piracy!? How many times, exactly, must we, the Consumer, tell you what we want, before we finally give up, and stop buying all-together?  I'm not even a \\"Smurf\\" fan. I thought the movie was decent... could've done without the blatant & irritating product-placement & glamorization of certain things, behaviors, etc... could've been a lot better... and yes, I'm still just as ticked-off, despite the fact that I would give this movie only 3.5 stars (at best)... it's the PRINCIPLE, not the movie, so don't waste your breath saying \\"oh, that person's just a smurf-fanatic\\" or something just as ridiculous -- that would be your Denial & Self-Deception speaking; and it won't give you an \\"out\\" this time, sorry.)   Common sense... not really socommon anymore, is it?
B005OOL1IC|3.0|Hangover 2 is Hangover 1 except set in Bangkok and a resort in Thailand. Other than the locations the setup is pretty much exactly the same. It however amused me and the Mrs. so thats why the heck I ordered it.  I will be curious what the third disc will contain since this being a WB BD/DVD set with UV B.S. copy does not require a separate disc just a code.<br /><br />The reason I ordered this and other WB bluray combo packs is mainly for the DVD.  You can download a physical copy of movies on to your iOS device and it will playback without an Internet connection, but my beef with WB, the owners of Flixster BTW (surprise surprise) is that the copy has such a low bit rate that it makes it pretty much unwatchable except on an iPhone.  Now I am not saying that the usual digital copies were spectacular, but at least they were DVD quality.  The iTunes copies usually supplied are on average 1.5 to 2gb files. But the UV copies they give to playback on an iOS device clock in at a pathetic sub 500mb in size.  Some people rip thier own copy (nothing I would do) wink wink.  If the other studios start to release UV copies, I predict most will make thier own.  The only glimer of hope is that Disney is listening and refuses to put thier movies \\"in the cloud\\" fart cloud IMHO.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Terrible. Oh, looks fun enough, except I purchased this game and, ''ERROR!'' Seems I'm not the only one this has happened to... my advice, don't waste your money or time.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|The watch is sturdy, compact, and appears to be very accurate.  Positives:  1) Readability is excellent and enhanced by the stark contrast between the black dial and the white numbering.  2) Illumination is strong after moderate exposure to sunlight.  3) Easy to set and adjust.  4) Day and date window is a strong positive factor.  5) Interesting aesthetic value in being able to see the mechanism in action from the exposed back.  Negatives:  1) The band isn't high quality and is quite uncomfortable. Since the band is easily replaced (with a nice military strap)this factor presents a negligible weight against the value of the watch. More of a stylistic deficiency than anything else.  Neutral:  1) The watch is smaller than what is commonly sold in the United States, a bit bigger than a quarter. For some, this may be a problem. I find the size to be a positive factor since it means the watch is light, compact, and will not get in the way.  Accuracy:  After three days of persistent wear (recent purchase), it has been within +/- 1 second of the U.S. atomic clock. The watch is simple and, to date, appears to be reliable.  NOTE: I will be updating this review in a month. For the moment, 5 stars.  [UPDATE: 2/22/2012]  As stated previously, the accuracy of this watch is impressive. Having worn it consistently for the past two weeks, it has kept within +3/-3 seconds of the U.S. Atomic clock.  As for the size of the watch, I mentioned that it was a bit larger than a quarter. This is technically inaccurate as the watch measures at around 36mm from one end of the  bezel to the other. However, the dial itself is roughly 29mm which is only slightly larger than the 25mm diameter of a quarter.  This is not a hulking watch. It is very compact and unobtrusive, and relatively small compared to what one might be used to. I have since replaced the band with a leather Swiss tech strap as suggested by one of the other reviewers, just to give the watch a bit more of that \\"pilot\\" look.

All the while that missing admission, like Earth II in the sky, looms ever larger.<br /><br />Their burgeoning relationship, we know, is as flawed by human weakness as was the accident, and yet here are two people, with no alternative means of recovery and who offer each other great redemption, but only so long as there is this awful lie between them.\\"<br /><br />First, a personal observation to Olly.  Olly, you can wait a lifetime for people who have wronged you (even when you have proof) to apologize \\"the admission looms,\\" at least if you are only accepting words as The Apology. Sometimes actions speak many more worlds than do words.<br /><br />We have an echo of ourselves from the following scenes:<br /><br />1. man with tinfoil hat and sandwich sign warns that earth 1 is a holograph of earth 2<br />2. main character i believe tells us that earth 2 probably does not see us as earth 1<br />3. CETI official finds she has another self born the same date in the same place<br />4. We are told just before the end that \\"synchronicity\\" is broken the moment earth 1 saw earth 2 (which i missed the first time because this film is not yet captioned).<br />5. Rhonda meets herself in the last scene, presumably to ask herself what happened with John and any other astrophysics questions she has. Her other self does not appear to be focused on self-flagellation, so perhaps in earth 2, Rhonda graduated from MIT and became a real astrophysicist, instead of a cleaner.<br />6. Rhonda signs something to the wise, prophet like janitor while he lay in his hospital bed, I have to watch it a third time to try to transcribe it. I think it is something along the lines of \\"I get it.\\" This makes the viewer further wonder, who is this guy on earth 2?<br /><br />this begs the main question of the film the age-old question, WHO AM I? To which there is no answer, or no collective answer, each of us must find our own individual answer to this ongoing query.<br /><br />i see it now upon second viewing as a parallel reality (see for instance The Elegant Universe series on string theory). In this other earth, we have selves which have lives. these other selves trade information with us here on this earth all the time, every time we reflect on anything we see, hear, etc. all sensory impressions are traded back and forth all day long with this other \\"self.\\"  and i believe all night long in dreams. for some those dreams are lucid, for others they are not.<br /><br />So i am not sure about the ending.  I, like Olly, like a good story, and this one is well-written, well-acted and proves that if a job is well done, it does not need expensive special effects to dress it up, nor will those special effects improve a not so good story not so well told as this one.<br /><br />I don't see the relationship between Rhoda and John as Olly does.  I don't see her as \\"lying\\" as much as I did the first time around, even though she herself exhibits shame, remorse, and calls herself a liar.  I think a true liar would have not even ever approached John \\"to make amends,\\" even though she never really tells us either as Rhonda or as the narrator (since she is both)why she went to John, if only to apologize, after two close viewings, I still did not hear or read any apology.  She does not actually say she is sorry in words, she does it in actions.<br /><br />Jane Roberts, writing as Seth once said that most human tragedies, most of the pain we cause to one another, what we generally label as \\"crime,\\" \\"evil,\\" etc. is unintentional misdirected efforts to \\"help,\\" that backfire. I have seen quite a few examples of this in my own personal life.  What message I get on the second viewing is that of great empathy for the perp. She was reckless, yes. She shoulda woulda taken a cab.  She paid a price for the lives she took. Some would say not a big enough price. She did, however, in the end, the impossible. She restored, or tried to restore John to the place he would have been had she not been driving drunk that night. By playing around with synchronicity--by altering time as we know it. Did John find his wife and son in earth 2? We'll have to wait for the sequel for that, and the concept is ripe for a TV series, IMHO, similar to the Stargate seri.<br /><br />we all wonder what if? this movie is a study in many what ifs, makes good viewing for philosophy class, and i hope the high school and college teachers who also share my appreciation for good science fiction give it a watch. it is worth watching at least twice. To end, I'd like to quote Olly B. again, to say we all offer one another \\"great redemption\\" just by being aware of the echoes we create.  Every action, has an equal and opposite reaction. Every \\"shoulda woulda\\" may exist physically in a parallel reality. One gets what one focuses most on.why she went to John, if only to apologize, after two close viewings, I still did not hear or read any apology.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Whenever someone asks me what this book is about, I have a hard time describing it.  However, I shall try my best.  This book is about a long-standing challenge between two magicians.  The magicians pit their proteges against one another, using a circus as the battlefield to create fantastic illusions.  The best part is that the illusions are real.  This is a story of love, hate and something in between.  It is absolutely worth the read.  The author uses such imagery, that you frequently feel you are a part of the circus and the challenge.  You feel for each character as if you know them personally.

It has everything you need to make the perfect character and obtaining all the rare items you desire; not to mention detailed guides to all of the quests in the game and maps of every territory and dungeon. One if the most helpful additions is the access code to an interactive map online, giving you the locations of anything you need to find. I use mine every time I get one to see which step I want to take next in the development of my character.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|I bought this pack on Black Friday when it was half off and do not regret it for a second. I've been waiting for the whole set to come out for years. Sure it doesn't have all of the special features the edition coming out next year will have, but it is great if you just want all of the movies in one high quality package this is perfect for you.

B000G6R7B8|5.0|After searching for a quality watch with an acceptable case diameter, I am glad to have found this watch.  I have a small wrist.  Unfortunately, as the years go by, case diameters seem to get larger and larger, leaving customers such as myself with few options.  This Seiko 5 is an excellent choice.  I have owned it for about a year, and it has been accurate (within fifteen second per day) and comfortable.  It also does not seem to scratch very easily (though I certainly do not abuse my watches).  Overall, this is an outstanding value and a true five-star watch.  I wish other makers would provide more selection in the sub-40mm case diameter size (especially 36mm-38mm).
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As a consant Stephen King reader I have to say...This by far is one of the best ever. Very different from his horror and alien books..this one leaves you wondering...what if?  What if you could do it?  Would you go back in time and save JFK?  In the past with some of Stephens books, I have struggled to get into them, meaning the beginning I found a little slow....not the case here.  From chapter one, I couldnt put it down.  I would start reading at 9pm thinking I would fall alseep, next thing I knew its 2am and Im trying to stay awake to see what happens next.  Stephen King is a great story teller and this one is no exception.  Although this book is about time travel and the choice to change history, he couldnt seem to resit sticking the Child Killing Clown from Derry Maine in there.  I had to smile.  Wasnt crazy about the end of the book...but I wont give it away for you.  Read it, you wont be dissapointed!! You dont have to be a Stephen King fan to enjoy it.
0440241901|4.0|I thought this book was a delightful, light, funny, quick read. I enjoyed the concept - it was different and unique. The book also had several laugh-out-loud moments. I liked the character of Emma - an ordinary girl with relatable problems with her boyfriend, family and friends - and I enjoyed watching her grow more confident in herself as the book went on. The book wasn't perfect... it does stick to the formula of chick lit books which makes the plot predictable (but enjoyable in a no-thinking-required way). I felt that the ending wasn't as strong as the rest of the book - there is a secondary plot twist at the end that is unnecessary and just makes the book last longer without adding much to it.

B002KSPKRS|1.0|Let me start off by saying, this headset sounds incredible. I absolutely love the deep sound it provides and it really immerses you into the game with surround sound that works. That is not the reason that I don't like this headset.<br /><br />The problem with this headset is that every few minutes, it will make a popping noise, or sometimes many pops all in a row. At first I didn't really think much of it, but as it continued it began to actually hurt my ears from all the popping.<br /><br />I had such high hopes for this headset but I'm going to switch to the X12's in the hopes that a wired headset won't have that problem.

0345529057|5.0|This has become my single favorite series of books. The story is epic and compelling, with a entire slew of interesting and unique characters.

B003Y5H5AG|3.0|Here's the deal: I'm giving this movie 5 stars because my son *LOVES* it; I'm giving it 1 star because of this new \\"digital copy\\" format called Ultraviolet.  So, the average is 3 stars.  Ultraviolet is fitting name for this new format, because just like how you can't see UV ray, the way this is structured my kid will never be able to see this movie on an iPad.  I put the movie in for him and thought I would get the digital copy downloaded while he was watching it.  Smurfs is almost over, and I'm just now figuring this stupid system out.  I had to create *2* accounts (though I actually created 3: Sony, UV, and Flixter which I apparently didn't need?  Or maybe I will, who knows, their site isn't working properly right now anyway).  I should not have to create so many accounts just to watch a movie I paid for.....    Streaming quality is horrible: Netflix is far superior (and I'm less than 10 feet from my router).  The interface is not user friendly -- on the iPad I click \\"Videos\\" then the movie I want to watch and its there.  It's so simple a toddler can do it.  Here, I have to log in to my Sony Pictures account (something my son won't be able to figure out for many more years) just to watch a pixelated version that looks like it was shot with an old camera phone.    If he wants to watch Smurfs on the iPad while on the go -- forget it. There is a digital copy downloading to my computer, but as best as I can determine its not syncable to my iDevice -- *SO WHATS THE POINT?!?!*  I'm not talking about streaming here -- I'm talking about long car rides where I put 3-4 movies on the device, hand it to him in the back seat and let him watch until we get to our destination.  If I can't add this file format to iTunes, its pointless to own.  I don't care about streaming content from the cloud -- not everyone has an unlimited data plan and not everyone has a 3G enable tablet.  I'm very irritated right now.  I'll end up paying double for this movie because I'll download the iTunes version for him at some point.  And if this was an easy, universal system as its painted to be I'd be okay with it -- not everything I use has the Apple logo on it.  The way this is set up makes me want to pirate the movie to a digital format that I can use.  Which is exactly what the studios are claiming to prevent -- so if thats the case, stop making it so hard for honest people to use the media we pay for in a fair way!  Stick with iTunes downloads and you won't go wrong.

The book gives an incredible detailed account of a man that before I knew and other knew very little about and you see how he was more than just the founder of Apple but so much more. There were bits where I wish it would go a little further but if you own any Apple product or just love reading about fascinating people you have to get this book! I couldn't put this book down.

B005KN5AES|5.0|As a fan of all rock music, I especially loved the 80's and early 90's. My favorite Riot albums were \\"Thundersteel\\" and \\"The Priviledge Of Power\\", and this release feels like it could have come out between those two.  I had almost given up on Riot in the last 20 years, as they had been reduced to just another generic power-metal lineup, but when I saw their latest reunited them with 80's vocalist Tony Moore, I was very excited.  By the way, the version I found in the local record store had bonus tracks \\"Johnny's Back\\", and \\"Metal Soldiers\\" (both live).  I feel Tony's voice has actually improved over the last 2 decades, as he is given even more vocal gymnastics to perform, and nails it every time. His voice has become so refined, that the band almost sounds like a Queensryche/Fifth Angel hybrid at times.  The first track \\"Riot\\", is the most out-of-place, as it is the fastest, most modern sounding track on the album, and they seem to have thrown everything including the kitchen sink into it, but it does give you a glimpse into the great vocals that will follow.  The rest of the album has more memorable melodies, with streamlined writing, but nostalgic 80's sound.  Bottom line, however......it's all good!

B0041QSZJM|1.0|I bought this eagerly in the 2010 Christmas season. I am an enthusiast for Christmas albums and own many. I play Christmas CDs daily in the season. I have loved the 3 Pink Martini CDs I own and I do play them a lot. Sadly this one was a miss. It seemed that they maybe rushed to produce it and I found it lacking in their usual quality, zest, and luster. If they had only put the artistry and care that went into the great CD cover into this music! I played it once, and then tried again a second time seeking maybe that one great cut I could love, with no success. It was put away. I will try again this season one more time and if that fails it gets tossed.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Midnight in Paris is beautifully filmed with a good heart and dose of Woody Allen whimsy (my favorite of his various aspects), so I really enjoyed it. However, I wasn't as over the moon for it as many apparently were, so it was a 4-star, rather than 5-star, film to me. The story centers on Gil (Owen Wilson) a successful screenwriter who dreams of writing novels instead. He and his fiance (Rachel McAdams) - who seem mismatched from the start - visit Paris, and on one of his night wanderings (to escape the many social engagements she wants to attend) he finds himself transported to 1920's Paris, the 'Golden Age' to him. He interacts with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Salvatore Dali, and Picasso.<br /><br />On the plus side, Paris has never been more beautiful as in this film, even on the 'small screen' (I can only imagine how gorgeous this was in the theaters.) The characters all are well-cast, and as an Owen Wilson fan, I was happy to see him do so well in this role. All of the 20's characters are also deftly played, although my favorite scenes - the funniest - were actually the contemporary ones, with his fiance's stuffy in-laws and friends. Wilson's character got to show a bit of acerbic wit in those scenes, and hence they were more fun. The 20's scenes were all very earnest and a bit self-important, so I just didn't enjoy them as much.<br /><br />So overall, fun, unique, beautiful, and with many funny moments. If you love Paris, and especially if you love the bohemian Paris of the 1920s (and all the artists that thrived then), you will LOVE this film. If you are a fan of Allen's whimsy, you probably will too. Otherwise, it may just be good or OK for you, but certainly still worth seeing.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|The dvd arrived as scheduled. It was sealed and in perfect condition just as it was described. Very happy with our purchase :)
B003Y5H5AG|3.0|&lt;Sigh> Being an animation nut and a fan of The Smurfs since the cartoon aired back in the 80s, I was really wanting to like the Smurfs film. It tells the story of a young couple expecting their first child and getting all the anxiety associated with that kind of change in life. That's when The Smurfs enter the picture. We meet Gargamel in his castle lair with his cat, Azrael, making plans to lure and capture them. He ends up following The Smurfs through a portal to New York City. The Smurfs, as I mentioned earlier, end up taking up with Grace and Patrick Winslow in their high-rise apartment. During the course of the movie, they help Patrick work through his issues about becoming a father, and reassure Grace that he's up to it. Long story short, Gargamel comes up with a master plan to get his Smurfs and that's when things get interesting.<br /><br />The Smurfs isn't a bad movie, by any means. It's a decent movie with alot of good humor in it, mostly provided by Hank Azaria(Gargamel). I guess I was expecting it to be a little more along the lines of movies like Casper or Scooby Doo(since the latter was made by this movie's director). Yet, the movie was a little thin as far as the screenplay was concerned. At any rate, the cast did a tremendous job with their roles. It must've did well enough at the box-office as there is a second movie planned for theaters in 2013.<br /><br />Although, I do recommend it to everyone. It is a good family film. I just can't bring myself to give it more than three stars. For some reason, I feel the movie doesn't live up to the spirit and overall quality of the cartoon series. I hate to be that way but I like to be honest.<br /><br />All I can say is rent this one first and then decide if it is worth a purchase.

B004I2K4E8|3.0|Many of the reviews have already gone over the casting and performances in this concert, so my review will concentrate SOLELY on the motion artifacts inherent in this BluRay.  Though I haven't read all the reviews on Amazon for Les Miserables: The 25th Anniversary Concert Blu Ray, I haven't seen anyone mentioning the odd (and to me, very distracting) video motion artifacts in this BluRay presentation.  There is a motion artifact that severely blurs the image (most obvious with movement) at regular intervals throughout this BluRay. It occurs at regular periodic intervals of approximately 1/3 - 1/2 of a second. Most of the time, the video quality is quite pristine with good clarity and sharpness, especially in close-ups and when the performers are relatively still/stationary. Unfortunately, there are lots of panning shots in this production, and of course, the performers aren't completely stationary. When there is movement, the motion artifacts are noticeable and it blurs the image so much as to present a doubled image.  After reviewing it again and again, I've determined that the artifact is not caused by the display chain but is inherent in the BluRay. To dispel any doubts, my display chain accepts and displays 1080/24p, and has no problems with any of the other 100+ 24p BluRays in my collection. The motion artifact is not caused by the display chain. A simple test to determine that it is not an artifact of telecine 3:2 pulldown judder in the display chain (as from a display chain incapable of reproducing 1080/24p)is to pause the movie and advance it frame-by-frame.   I can see the image go from clear and sharp frames as I advance frame-by-frame, to blurry and doubled at the exact same specific frames in paused images, and it's possible to see the transition in panning shots, going from clear (with only the normal very slight inherent blurring due to the exposure times) to the double imaged, blurry mess at regular intervals as I advance frame-by-frame. Obviously, the sharper and larger the display, the more obvious these artifacts are.  One of the scenes in which this can be seen quite obviously is at 45:00 during 'Master Of The House'. Beginning exactly at that time, there is a panning shot centered on Thenardier. Because he is centered in the shot, the motion artifacts are not as immediately obvious on him, however I can see them quite obviously on the performers sitting on the benches in the background to the left of him on the screen. Watch them as the camera pans past him and you can see the people on the bench blur into doubled images at regular intervals of about 1/2 a second.  Unfortunately, the motion artifacts are not restricted solely to the background. Another example is in the scene where the bishop has just given Jean Valjean the candlesticks, as the camera pans up Valjean, he blurs visibly three times in the short time it takes to pan up from his waist to his face.  It appears to be some sort of conversion artifact. It would appear that Soho Transfer (the company that converted the footage from the HD master to 24p) is responsible for this screw up.  I just thought it might help some folks considering this purchase to avoid disappointment by being aware of this ahead of time. The music of Les Miserables is of course, one of the main draws and reasons for purchasing this, but if it were the sole reason, I could have just stuck with the soundtrack on CD (not considering the differences in audio quality between CD and BluRay formats).
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love this game ..bought it when it was first launched and it sucked then ..but new upgraded for kindle fire is so much better and it has local and online multiplayer too!!!
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|I bought this disk as an after thought; I new little about it.  I know of Slash and G'n'R but I was never a big fan.  Good, new rock music is rare these days so I decided to try it.  I played it and was very pleased with its contents.  It is really versatile.  It probably has the best Ozzy on it in decades and a bunch of other voices on it that give it the feel of a collection of truly different bands.  It is a must for old rockers like me.
B005VJ8ATS|5.0|This is a beautiful movie.  I simply cannot get inside the heads of those who give this movie negative reviews.  It is a beautiful concept, executed with sere, tender restraint.  The primary character, Rhoda, is drawn and acted with authenticity.  Brit Marling is phenomenal.  If you like good movies, you will like this film.
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|I loved this movie, its what good old movies are about, for kids and adults both. It has heart, and love, and the cute smurfs. If you have a heart, and love in your soul, then you will love the magic of this dvd....for all you who have let your childhood dreams and wishes behind, then there is nothing left for you. Smurfs is for those who still dream , and have the child deep in there heart, for all the haters, your one step closer to the grave....never let the love and the child within you DIE.

B005NPLXJ4|4.0|All you Metallica fans should be thanking Lou Reed for bringing Metallica up from the ashes of the past.  How do you save a band from utter irrelevance?  Get the Godfather of punk rock to sing for you.  I know all you Metallica fans wanted yet another re-hash of \\"Enter Sandman\\" and believe me, there is plenty of that sound on this album, but this is different, fresh, and a surprise.  It has to be at least 15 years since Metallica did anything \\"fresh\\", so.  I find this a welcome addition to my library.  I might even put this album on my ipod.<br /><br />I'd give it five stars, but i still hear to much \\"Enter Sandman\\", the same song metallica has been re-doing since their beginning.  No talent hacks.  And you kids out there who think Lou is an old fart, remember that metallica are mostly in their 40s.  Lou?  70.  and without lou reed, there would have never been a metallica.
B0036TGSR6|3.0|The movie is really not that bad, but this holistic pinkier-than-thou attitude to everything spoils all the possible pleasures. Otherwise, it is a pretty decent movie that keeps you guessing until the very end.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I chose this case because it was amazon's highlighted case for the Fire. While it is a little expensive (sidetrack to 4 stars, not 5), the case does what it is suppose to do. It is VERY light, as it is advertised. The kindle fire seems a bit heavy on its own, and with this case, there seems to be no weight gain/difference which is very appreciated.  The cover part that covers the screen does seem a bit flimsy, but it covers the screen quite nicely and again does not add on any extra weight, and with the elastic string, the cover protects the screen.  Regarding the stand part, the part that covers the screen folds over to become the stand. On a flat surface, the stand works fine, but don't expect it to work as well on an unstable surface (i.e. bed). I also really appreciate that not only the cover part becomes the stand but fully folds back (like a magazine cover) so I can work on my kindle fire without the cover flapping around.  The case has a nice rubberized feel to it, so it doesn't feel as if it will slide out of your hands. I ordered the pink color which is a nice hot pink. In conclusion, the case is a good one, does not add on extra weight and is very slim so it doesn't take up any extra room in your bag. The price may be a bit much, but the case gets the job done.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I borrowed this book for free with Amazon Prime and read it on my new Kindle Fire. I loved the books premise of the totalitarian government's The Hunger Games as a repressive tactic against the twelve districts that seem to be on the verge of rebellion. The government is a mix between the central power of the Soviet Union and the brutality of the Nazi party. Not only does the government force the twelve districts to select 12 \\"tributes\\" but also uses extreme violence to quell any rebellion. As the main character points out, crimes as small as petty theft are punishable by death. To exacerbate the districts situation, the government also keeps most of the districts in poverty as another tool to prevent rebellion.   Against this dystopic background, is the main character Katniss Everdeen who volunteers for the certain death that being a tribute entails after her little sister is selected. The book follows her journey to the Hunger games and her performance in the competition. The author depicts Katniss and all the other characters brilliantly while even providing sympathy for her opponents. The author focuses the blame for the violence in Katniss's life on the government and tries to depict her opponents as victims of this abuse. The end contains a brilliantly rebellious gesture by Katniss and provides hope for the next two sequels. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an entertaining experience with some food for thought. This book should not be simply classified as Young Adult as i believe this book can be enjoyed by anybody.

0446547654|3.0|I thought this was a nice story, but it was really predictable and seemed formulated. I am looking forward to seeing the movie, because I think it will actually make a better movie than a book. Not a bad read if you have the time, but not a book/story that will be life-changing, make you think, or provide a lot of entertainment. I just thought it was pretty good. I would actually give it 3.5 stars, but there are no halves.
B0000E1WKE|2.0|Whitney is very talented, but this is a very annoying holiday album.  There is too much back-beat on nearly every song making it sound more like a Muzaked soul album than a Christmas offering.  The music kept making me feel like I was \\"on hold\\" waiting for technical support for something.  I have over 2000 Christmas songs on my iPod.....many are truly great.  Not a single song on this CD will be added to that list, which really bums me out because she has an amazing voice. I was so rooting for this to be good.
B00642ZOIG|1.0|Thumbs down to the publisher for KINDLE pricing at $17.82! This book in page form can be purchased for $17.88 at Big W. I don't understand why it costs as much or more for the KINDLE version. Aren't there savings from actually printing, paper, etc.? Shame on the publishers.

B005PR2FD8|5.0|If you're one of those guys that's really into graphics/quality when it comes to moving pictures or polygons, then this is one of those must-watch types of media. The animation is just outstanding... some of the most beautiful eye-candy you are ever going to see. It really gives Advent Children a run for their money. Animation might lack a few frames and look robotic at times, but overall it still looks sweet. It starts out with plenty of action, courtesy of the Williams sisters, then it moves onto drama... and then more EPIC Action! I am talking Matrix Revolutions-like... including the score. The movie might be quite silly and girly at times, but I think the action scenes do more than enough to deliver a solid feature.  The climax at the end... [SPOILERS!!!] is an EPIC battle between the Mishima clan. Three generations of the Mishima clan have one of the most epic CG battles that you're ever going to see, the only thing I did not like was the fact that Marshall Law... the best character in Tekken imo, was not included in the film.. shame. Still a good buy though, just make sure you see the 720p or 1080p versions.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Henry Fonda is so believable in his starring role in The Grapes of Wrath.  Though slow-paced, the movie gets you very emotionally involved in his family's journey from Dust Bowl-destroyed Oklahoma to California, because you sympathize with Fonda and the rest of his family immediately.  From the beginning, he seems like he's a bit scared and kind of helpless, and all of them feel that way about leaving their land.  Once in California, the family is no better off.  As I found out on the audiocommentary, the Farmers' Association in California terrorized migrant farmers about as badly as the KKK terrorized black people.  They exploited migrant farmers and looked down on them for being hickish, and smeared anyone who wanted better pay as a \\"Communist\\".  They had thugs trying to create conflict so they could intimidate organized labor.  It was interesting to learn that John Steinbeck, the author, was not himself a communist, but felt people ought not to be quick to stereotype anyone with communist views as \\"un-American\\".  The movie is said to be a lot more hopeful and less politically radical than the book.  Steinbeck said he wanted the book to be revealing, not satisfying, and provoke people to enact social reform.  It really opened my eyes to the day-to-day difficulties of surviving in poverty.  Director John Ford is very visually expressive, and on this, he has Citizen Kane cinematographer Gregg Toland working with him, creating a starkness with shadows, a closeness to the land through the composition of the shots, and a documentary feeling.  On the back of the disc are a documentary about the Fox studio head, Darryl F. Zanuck, and several other smaller features.  This is not a \\"fun\\" movie, but it is worthwhile and should make you forever more sympathetic to the plight of the poor.<br /><br />About the Darryl Zanuck documentary on the back of the disc:<br />For a general story of 20th Century Fox and its contributions to entertainment, look no further than this biography of Darryl F. Zanuck. A & E Biography always does well at combining personal and private, film footage and interviews, and narration in a fast-paced, meaningful way. This documentary is on the DVD of The Grapes of Wrath. You learn about the person of Darryl Zanuck and some of the risks and contributions he made to cinema. One thing I found particularly interesting is that The Longest Day and The Sound of Music were both made under intense financial pressure to recover from the extremely wasteful spending of Cleopatra (which starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton). Some of Zanuck's unique contributions were his willingness, like Harry Warner of Warner Brothers, to shine light on disturbing social problems, and that he used CinemaScope to get people going back to theaters after television threatened the movie industry.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I've watched every episode of The Walking Dead so far. I think this is a great show filled with surprising twists. I'm an avid zombie fan and usually like all things zombie-related, but this is definitely one of my favorite zombie works. I definitely wouldn't recommend letting children watch the show even though it does come on basic cable, but that's just me :)
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Great case.  It fits like a glove. The stand works great even in bed. Makes reading easier because I don't have to hold the kindles weight. Makes for a great enhancement to the tablet. I love it.  Very well designed. Looks like Amazon designed it specifically for the fire. For a clean, sleek, quality cover, this is a must buy. Ignore the bad reviews, they're bogus!
076790592X|5.0|Both a great book and very well done movie.I have read the book twice and am sure that I will read it again.It is rare for a movie to capture a book as well as this one did.An outstanding performance detailing how Morrie endured with strength and understanding a kind of death that we would all dread.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love this CD because it is very instrumental. It gets me thinking about life. They are great singers, and I like the fact that you can understand what they are saying. If you can't, then you can look in the lyrics that come with this wonderful product.
0439023491|5.0|This follow-up to [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] finds Katniss back in District 12, residing in a nice house in Victory Park with her mother and sister. Peeta and Haymitch live nearby although Katniss rarely sees them. She occasionally goes on hunting sprees with her best friend Gale but they never speak of their feelings for one another. Just before Katniss is scheduled to leave with Peeta for the mandatory Victory Tour though the 12 districts, President Snow pays her a visit, letting her know he believes she does not truly love Peeta and used this to manipulate the prior games. Snow tells her that her small act of rebellion has incited unrest in the districts and threatens her if she does not thwart this. Although Katniss tries to downplay her victory and let Peeta do most of the talking during the tour, a speech she makes in one of the districts does the very thing Snow warned her against. Snow's punishment is to make the upcoming 75th Hunger Games a special one, throwing prior victors into the arena to fight to the death. Katniss and Peeta are chosen from their district and once again Peeta tries to protect Katniss by proclaiming she is carrying his baby. Katniss makes the decision that Peeta will be the one to survive these games and she will do everything possible to ensure he is victor. But Haymitch has been working behind the scenes and Katniss soon finds she has no control over anything, including ending her own life.<br /><br />Book 2 of [[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]] skips over scenarios readers may be curious about such as Katniss's reunion with Gale after her return from the Hunger Games, how she and Peeta dealt with the aftereffects of the games, etc. However, this does not take away from a powerful tale of love and danger, the confusion of a young woman over her feelings for two men, and the political insights into a corrupt government sliding into rebellion. Collins gives her readers characters to love and hate; an intensely graphic, bloody battle; and three people caught up in an at times agonizing triangular relationship. Undoubtedly, fans will be anxious for the next and final book in this galvanizing series.sely graphic, bloody battle; and three people caught up in an at times agonizing triangular relationship.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I started reading King as a kid in the early 1970's - often bleary-eyed the morning after because I had stayed up half the night - often reading under the covers with a flashlight so my parents didn't catch me.  When King is great there is a kind of \\"horror immersion\\" that takes place, and I particularly loved his long epic pieces like The Stand. I would be at the bookstore the day any new King novel was released.  Sometimes his work could seem a little \\"Stephen King Formulaic\\" - but just when you thought maybe he had lost it - he reinvents himself either in the horror and suspense realm - or sometimes simply through great writing and storytelling, ala' The Green Mile.<br /><br />In 11/22/63 King once again shows the reader he is the master, transporting us to a new time and place. Combine time travel with the Kennedy assasination, throw in a love story, and you have pretty much covered all the bases for a compelling novel. Like most King books we begin in Maine, but end up in Texas tracking Lee Harvey Oswald.  A big book - it is lighter on King's trademark horror and more about compelling storytelling.  It flattens a bit in the middle as our hero spends what seems like too much time just tracking Oswald, but overall a great read and one of the best King books in years!
B000V5SIFS|5.0|When at their best Star Trek and science fiction examine questions of humanity. The pilot episode \\"The Emissary\\", and this one \\"Duet\\" are two such gems! Each season of Deep Space 9 has episodes with great storytelling.<br /><br />There are many episodes with great storytelling through the seven years of this series! But you have to be willing to wade through as the story lines get better more often. Each character has transformative journeys through the seven years of the series! Good finds.

B000NVT0RU|5.0|This film tells a story that the french would like to forget. In both World Wars the French, as well as the British, extensively used the manpower provided by their colonies to restore (or not loose) their dominions. Fake promises of future independence or equal treatment were made to convince volunteers...Promises never fulfilled before other bloodbaths... If you like war history, you must see this film ! Afterwards you might watch the \\"[[ASIN:B0002JP2OI The Battle of Algiers (The Criterion Collection)]]\\" to better understand what happened next. Also, do not forget to watch the excellent BBC's documentary \\"The Forgotten Volunteer\\" offered as a bonus in the BBC's \\"[[ASIN:B00097DY5M Horror in the East]]\\" DVD.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|Decent gameplay, but the ads are completely inappropriate, especially for children or teens. In the two minutes I used the app, every ad was for dating services or porn. Uninstalling.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Pure delight!  Some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen, makes me want to go there.  Pierce Brosnan's singing is a little flat at times, but he's always lovely to look at.  Christine Baranski has always been a favorite of mine, a great Broadway pro.  What an angelic voice and beautiful face Amanda Seyfried has. Everyone else is perfect and fun especially the dash of Julie Walters.  The whole movie is joyous.  I also own the CD and again love the words to a lot of the songs, I can remember the visuals of the movie as I'm hearing them while I'm sewing, especially \\"Does Your Mother Know.\\"  Good family fun.
1402210795|4.0|When  I was about eleven, my mother bought me this book. I loved it! I laughed out loud quite often. Being a naive young girl, I didn't for a minute think past the fun of the story and I think that is the fun of a novel like this. If you can truly escape and not \\"think\\" while reading the book, it is quite enjoyable. For a young girl who rarely laughed, it was a wonderful, rare escape!
B0000032LS|5.0|I was lucky enough to see the original with Tim and Meatloaf at the Roxy on Sunset in 1974 and it was incredible.  Even though there's nothing like live, the swimming pool scene helped surpass the theatre performance.  I also have the CD and REALLY LISTEN to the words of the songs, especially \\"Don't Dream It, Be It\\" and \\"I'm Going Home.\\" Curry's voice is unsurpassed and Richard O'Brien is a freakin genius to have written it all.  Classic is classic no matter what the genre!
B001NESPHC|5.0|This is one of the few albums I have played that sounds great anywhere -- mini hifi, car, lo-fi, hi-fi, ipods.  Listen to the audio preview and you will know what I mean.  Jazz vocal lovers must not let this pass.
0060873027|2.0|I'm a long time fan of Michael Crighton.  I started with Andromeda Strain, and almost never looked back.  The best thing about Crighton was his ability to illustrate the \\"unintended consequences\\" of technology, and in later works, the consequences of the \\"politicization\\" of science and technology.  He was skilled in applying cold analytic logic to help readers understand technology.  Even better, his books were so well researched and laid out that even fantastical themes (cloning of dinosaurs and timetravel) seemed believable and logical.  Unfortuantely, this ability to make \\"unbelievable\\" technology into a believable premise was completely lost in this book.  It starts interestingly enough with a break in at a high tech facility---but quickly becomes a ridiculous paradoy of Crighton's earlier books.  I really almost had to stop reading once the protagonists were shrunk to insect size.  The characters encounters with microscopic flora and fauna is structired similarly to the human encounters with dinosaurs in Jurassic park---but completely unbelievable and cheesy. The ensuring race for survival is akin to a 1950's B movie made on low budget.  In addition, the writing is simply poor----and plot and character developemnt is labored.  Alas, this only proves that \\"you really can't go home again\\".  We have lost a great talent when we lost Crighton---and ghost written travesties like this only serve to remind us how much we've lost.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|For the CD and musical content, I give this product full stars.  For collectors, you may appreciate knowing that the CD holder is hard cardboard with a tight envelope sleeve.  CD gets scratched easily from repeating storing.  You might want to consider putting your disc in a separate jewel case.  Other than that, enjoy the typically great music from Sigur Ros.
B005GK6QSO|3.0|Great musicianship? Check. Fabulous vocals? Check. Top notch production values? Check. So what's wrong here? These are some of the schlockiest songs I've heard in a long time. No edge and no drive at all. Power ballads? C'mon... Its like Journey meets Firehouse in 1986. Of course its not all bad but just not what I was expecting. I'm a huge Circus Maximus and prog rock fan (Darkwater, 7th Wonder, Nightwish, Myrath, DT, Thought Chamber, Symphony X and more),  and this seems like this album was \\"something to do\\" in between new offerings from Circus Maximus and Leverage.. Kinda like floor wax, all shine, no depth...

B005LRWRZ8|3.0|I was really looking forward to this CD coming out, but not expecting much judging by the last few releases.  The vocals and lyrics were worse than I thought they'd be, but the guitar work was some of the best I've ever heard anywhere.  I'll be a Megadeth fan for life.

0316017930|1.0|I saw this book on one of the popular news show (FOX or CNN). I was expecting more from this book. The book is not holding my interest. I haven't read through the entire book. When I have the time I'll reread the book and hopefully I can give it a better review but as it stands I have to give it one star.
1439130833|4.0|I believed in inner power and the substance of the Universe, however my life was still extremely frustrating at times and i didn't know why. Several years ago somebody recommended the DVD of The Secret to me so i went with it and, after watching it, felt totally inspired, so much so I handed my notice in at work to develop myself.<br /><br />A couple of years later and the biggest change was in my mind and mental outlook on life. The Secret set me on a journey of discovering the original new thought authors from late 1800's and slowly, but surely, I have seen changes. Last year I discovered two authors and everything clicked into place, namely Neville Goddard and Joanne St.Clair. These authors really heightened the journey of discovery which The Secret set me on, resulting in a six figure lottery win earlier this year.<br /><br />I would definately recommend this book and the DVD, but just sticking to this and nothing else is not enough. If you really want change you must keep discovering your inner Spirit and its relationships to life. Neville taught me more about the imagination and its use, and Joanne St.Clair put it all into perspective in a very modern and down to earth way.<br /><br />Enjoy.
1451648537|4.0|Traveling recently from New York to London and a few days later on to Vienna and back, I had quite a bit of time on my hands. I bought the hardback copy of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson at Newark airport leaving and I had only just received on my Apple MacBook by email SOME NEW KIND OF TRAILER TRASH Volume I, an autobiography by Dr. Brad Blanton. I found these parallel lives in review to go together quite nicely. Jobs and Blanton (like myself) were/are products of the tailwinds of the 60s, and were both unconventional enough to think outside the box. Jobs placed himself at the intersection of art (aesthetics) and technology, Blanton is at the intersection of love and politics. Steve Jobs saw the potential of the digital computer and was driven to bring it to the individual in creative new forms. Brad Blanton saw the potential of deep honesty for the development of true intimacy and was driven to create a practice out of that insight and bring that to everyone in the world. Jobs was a demanding (even cruel) taskmaster in his devotion to perfection; Blanton was tireless in his willingness to explore the boundaries of love and sexuality. Both, in their different ways, wanted \\"power to the people\\" and were willing to upset conventional morality to fight for it.   Now Jobs is gone and we have to see where his legacy will lead and to what extent his influence will continue at the leading edge of technology for the people. Brad Blanton is still with us, still applying Radical Honesty in new spaces and places, and about to lead a 20 city tour to bring it directly in the service of the new grassroots \\"occupy\\" movement for social equality and a sustainable future for the human race. Blanton's process is as much a mutation in human thought as are Jobs' innovative and beautifully crafted machines, and it offers far deeper implications for changing the way we live and relate to one another.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I'll admit, I didn't catch this series the first time around. In fact, I saw a preview of it that FOX managed (rarely) to air, and was completely turned off. And then sometime about a year or so after it went off air, I heard about how GOOD Firefly was and a friend told me that if I liked Farscape (I LOVED Farscape!) that I would love Firefly. And he was right.   It has everything I love: scifi action, world-building, unique and interesting characters (especially River and Mal), relationships that intrique (Mal and Inara! and Kaylee and Simon), and adventure, enough to keep me reeling for weeks.   I fell for the series just about from Serenity. I knew not to watch from the order of the way FOX aired the episodes, and in my estimation, that asinine decision is a major contribution to the reason the series failed. It's not that it sucked. In fact, it's the exact opposite.   FOX has rarely been able to properly market a scifi show. X-Files is the only exception and even then, it was more a fluke than anything else. FOX didn't market that show very well at first. Like Firefly, it caught on by word of mouth.   Firefly is an amazing cult hit and spawned a fan-successful movie, Serenity. I already own the DVDs for Firefly, but I'll be purchasing the blu-ray edition, not only for the better video and audio, but also for those extras that weren't on the DVD set.

Since Steve J. knew he was dying, he opened up in a way that would not have been otherwise possible.  Excellent read/listen.  Author did an outstanding job on Jobs!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|This is a good value.  My son and I are sharing this five disc combo set.  He has a 3D device and I enjoy having the digital on my iPod touch and soon to have iPad.  We also both have Blu-ray players so this was a no brainer in a way.  Cars 2 is a wonderful followup to Cars.  Enjoyed the humor and amazing animation.
B005TPCQ5I|4.0|Worth watching. Well acted. There were funny moments. Quite sad at the end. It was very touching. I really enjoyed it.
1423119509|5.0|This bookset is a great steal. Anyone who enjoys Harry Potter will also love Percy Jackson! I personally have read the series 3 times. The books came quick & they looked like New. I was very pleased with my order the only down I have is that the chest they come in is not as sturdy as it looks and mine was damaged. I did end up taking the books out & just displaying them without the chest.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|This is the worst film ever made.  The movie with carrot top is better then this film.  It's terrible.  People who like this film have no taste.  Go and buy Inception and Shutter Island instead of this stinker.  They are about the same price combined as this film and you will thank me later.  This film is garbage.

0743454537|3.0|As always, Picoult provides a thoughtful look at a challenging topic that is far too close to reality for many families - kudos for her choices in subject matter!<br /><br />I've rated the book three-stars because I was frustrated with the number of flashbacks Picoult used to tell the story, and found it difficult to connect with the characters. For example, the misunderstandings and tortured relationship between the lawyer and guardian ad litem added nothing to the story. (The dog, Judge, was a star, by the way!) Picoult is a master of the written word and the writing was poetic, but a bit over the top at times.<br /><br />Bottom line: I really wanted to like this book more than I did. A friend and I are a book club of two, and I'll be curious to hear her thoughts on My Sister's Keeper.
0312330537|4.0|There is a little bit of truth in this novel.  The author Gregory David Roberts, took elements from his own life and placed them into his main character Lin.  So one has to wonder, how much is true and how much is fiction.<br /><br />Shantaram features Lin, an escaped convict from Australia who goes to Bombay to gain his freedom.  Once there, he starts out just exploring the area and meeting new friends and gradually moves to the slums where he becomes a doctor of sorts and cares for the poor people there.  But being an escaped convict the draw of crime is strong to him and he starts working in other pursuits that get him into more trouble than he could ever imagine.  Combine that with his love for Karla, a myserious woman living in Bombay as well and he isn't quite sure what he wants with his life.  Deep down he wants to do something good, but he finds it hard to set himself on the right path.<br /><br />Lin is Roberts.  Both escaped convicts who have traveled far they have an altruistic streak that sometimes makes them do bad things for good reasons.  As a recovered junkie, Lin to is susceptible to weakness.  And he faces many struggles within the novel.  I do have to say that I couldn't see what he saw in Karla.  I didn't find her particularly fascinating as a character.  And the group of friends he hung out with, they were awfully philosphical for criminals.  I'm not saying that all criminals aren't intelligent, but it seemed odd to me the particular dynamics of this group.  I also should say that I didn't really feel a particular connection to any character in this novel, but it was still interesting to read about them.<br /><br />Its a long meandering plot.  Honestly, the book can get too long in some ways but it was still pretty good.  It felt like it could all happen in real life, which given the author's past, could be very true.  It does make me wonder about Bombay though, from this book you would assume that the whole place is just crime ridden and black market and somehow I doubt that its all that way.  The story was heartfelt for sure and the realism made it a good read.  I felt like I was there and that's a testament to Robert's writing.<br /><br />An interesting book that reads real.  I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in different cultures or the struggle of everyday life.<br /><br />Shantaram<br />Copyright 2003<br />933 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B001HN6922|5.0|Cars 2 was a very touching, sweet, action-packed story. It was much better than Cars 1. (It would have to be, quite honestly.) It was quite funny at times (wasabi, anyone?) and had several good punch lines!!

B002ZCY7SW|1.0|I was ready to give this season 4 stars up through the 16th episode.  The end of the 16th episode would have been a good place to end this thing, because after that. . .whoever wrote the 17th episode (and beyond) obviously has never seen any of the earlier seasons, ESPECIALLY not Season 6.  How the producers and directors and actors could have gone along with the asinine plot(s) beginning in the 17th hour is beyond me.  I'm not even going to waste my time watching the 18th through 24th episodes, it's too ridiculous and ludicrous.  Let me just point out the glaring goofs in the 17th episode and then I'll shut up:  Don't get me wrong, I love Chloe, she's good at what she does as far as it goes, but to make her head of CTU? That's a real stretch.  Secondly, a woman being accepted as head of a Muslim country? What planet is this writer living on?  Don't they know ANYTHING about Muslim beliefs and customs? Come on, gimme a break!  But the real kicker for me was when they brought Charles Logan back from the dead and into the thick of things.  Excuse me, but President Logan was murdered by his wife during Season 6, or doesn't anyone remember?  And now he 'miraculously' rises from the dead to save the day?  With absolutely no ATTEMPT at explaining how he's supposed to be walking around alive?  Or maybe he's supposed to be a Zombie, maybe that's it.  At any rate, I'm going to call this season of 24, 16, and not waste my time on the final 7 episodes (I wish I hadn't seen #17).  If I could, I'd give this thing a NEGATIVE 5 stars.  It stinks to high heaven.  Don't waste your time on the thing.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|Well, I really wish that the song selection was a little bit better... I mean, Mind Riot or When I'm Down (I saw these songs played live and he owned the crap out of them), Like Suicide, Sweet Euphoria... I really feel like Chris Cornell should release a SongBook Volume 2 to get more of these songs out there, because he is that fabulous and this tour was excellent.  The album itself... captures his voice in its most simple and authentic form. He does not need a band, editors, anything other than his own talent. The songs on here are wonderful to listen to. I am the type of person who needs to sing along to everything, but right now, this album has me quiet because I just don't want to ruin how good it sounds (lol).  Do yourself a favour and pick up this album. Everything on here sounds great, warm, and in-tune. I have felt and after listening to this (and seeing him live on this tour), strongly feel that he is one of the most undercredited artists out there. Please don't steal or illegally download copies of this album; buy it, and give him the credit and attention that he deserves. It is worth the investment.
B005O30Y5Y|3.0|I purchased this item under the impression from the description that it included a dvd and blu ray copy. The image was the same as it currently is that says blu ray, but I double checked the description 3, yes 3 times, to make sure that it included a dvd copy. I knew it said movie only, so therefore would not include special features, or voice commentary, but I specifically bought this item because of the description that it included a dvd copy as well as the blu ray. So I was extremely disappointed when it arrived and in was the blu ray only version. I considered sending it back, but decided it's really not worth the trouble. I will likely take it to one of the local brick and mortar stores and see if I can exchange it. They have since changed the description of this item since I ordered, likely due to complaints and it now states that it is exclusively a blu ray copy. Wish I knew that then, I would NOT have bought it.
B001993Y3G|1.0|I saw this movie when it came out in theaters and have enjoyed watching it since.  I have been looking forward to owning the Blu-ray version of it.  One word describes the quality of this \\"High Definition\\" release, terrible.  It feels like I'm watching a DVD.  That's how bad it is.  Warner owes it to its customer to re-release a real High Definition version and allow owners to exchange them for free.  This is a travesty.

0316044938|4.0|What happens when a young person dies before they ever really lived? How does a family cope with unspeakable horror? The raw emotion is beautifully written about in [[ASIN:0316044938 The Lovely Bones]]. The most interesting part of the novel is not the motif of a ghost staying too close to her living relations, but that a death affects each person in unique ways. In this case, an overwhelmed mother abandons her husband and two children after a daughter is murdered. A sister grows up too soon after failing to help catch a murderer.<br /><br />The back cover promises an end that redeems, but those who have been through it know that nothing takes away the sting of a murdered loved one. In Alice Sebold's depiction of heaven, all possibilities are there and there are multiple heavens for each person. One can be alone or with other loved ones. It may look like a favored place on earth or not. There was a comfort to the idea even if the narrator never seemed rested in her afterlife.<br /><br />Give Ms. Sebold credit for authentic dialogue and a compelling narrative from the very first page. The Lovely Bones is well worth reading for any occasion.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|I have both of Adele's albums so had to buy this, especially as I just recently purchased a new Blue-ray Player. Watching this was just such a wonderful experience, not only is the picture quality fantastic but the sound quality is awesome too.  Adele is an amazing artist, so talented and gifted. If you are hesitating to get this, don't, you will not be disappointed.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My kids love this movie!  When I finally sat down to watch it I was quite amused.  Steve Carrell is so funny!!  Great movie!!!
B005LJITS0|3.0|I've never read Green Lantern in comic form, but I couldn't pass up 99 cents for the instant video rental on my Kindle Fire. I watched the movie over two mornings while on the treadmill at the gym. I wasn't expecting it to be on a Batman level - it's not - but the story line and characters were enough to keep me engaged. It's not a movie I would buy to watch over and over again but is definitely worth a viewing.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|If you are remotely familiar with Paleolithic art and find the spiritual aspects of it fascinating, this film will completely blow your mind! Werner Herzog has an uncanny ability to delve into the soul of humanity and somehow bring it to the surface of consciousness. He did it exquisitely with \\"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\\" and \\"Fitzcarraldo\\". He pulls it off again with this documentary masterpiece. Like most Herzog films, the ethereal soundtrack by Ernst Reijseger adds a beautiful element as well. I read a few other reviews on here about the poor 3D quality of this film. All I can say is that on my LG TV it was INCREDIBLE! The paintings presented in this format are so beautiful and far more complex than I ever imagined they could be. Get this film, absorb it and revel in the magic of life on earth.

1451648537|1.0|I enjoyed reading this book during our family vacation in Cancun, Mexico over the Thanksgiving holiday.  I could not put it down  Steve Jobs' passion for work and his private life were described in detail.  There were just enough technical aspects for a layman (non-scientific people) and his diet and Zen Buddhism were gone into.  I admired his eagerness to search for his biological mother and sister, but felt very sorry that he did not even once meet his biological father.  He respected his adopted father and exercised his work by following lessons from him from his young age with his adopted father.  His associations during his life span with the business world were very informative.  It was a very well written book.  Congratulations to Mr. Walter Isaacson.

0440236304|5.0|One of the best first hand accounts of the war that I have read. You can tell that the author isn't a polished writer but that makes this book so special. In his own words and down to earth style he conveys what he saw in a style that everyone can appreciate. I love it and plan to buy the other books by this author.

0385534639|2.0|The chapters were not tied together at all-at least the early ones weren't. They seemed to be little short stories, that, while beautiful, did not make any sense and didn't evoke an emotional response. Celia and Marco's love story did not seem believable, because their stories were so spread out, first they kiss in 1896, then 1898, and then 1901, it didn't seem really plausible, because there were so many time gaps. The only characters I liked were Poppet and Widget, although they weren't completely fleshed out, and maybe Tsukiko. That was it. Nobody else seemed to be completely real, and because the author was more focused on the circus (although she didn't really focus on anything, reading the book was like wearing someone else's glasses- you can see things, but don't see the fine detail) she didn't have great characters. Some things weren't very clear either, like why two characters died, and other things. Also, the author had sentences that didn't make sense, even when you read them aloud. Maybe an editor with more scrutiny would have cleaned things up? And the most disappointing thing was that the book had a great premise, and then it failed miserably. I gave the book 2 stars only because I loved the idea and cover art. The book was great, and terrible at the same time.

His deep belief in good design is also well covered, and at six hundred and odd pages - this book is worth every cent.  A stunning read.

MJK sings his butt off and the up and coming Miss Carina Round does a marvelous job on backup (and at times, lead) vocals.  Also, quite possibly my favorite album cover ever!  (Don't be mislead by it though.  The music, apart from a couple of songs, is nowhere near as silly as it makes you think).  Highly recommend this album.

CalenGoo retains the different colors that each separate calendar has so I can tell whether the event is mine, my husbands, or one of the other calendars.

1844137864|5.0|Banksy's book, Wall and Piece, is truly something that could be appreciated on many different levels. Captured in vibrant color in the pages of this hard cover book, Banksy's art evokes many feelings. Whether it be a chuckle at the Mona Lisa holding an RPG, awe at the modified oil paintings placed in various museums, or appreciation of the clever detail of his urban rats, this book has images that will make you laugh, think, and wonder \\"Is Banksy 'just' a graffiti artist or, more likely, a super-talented commentariat that uses spray paint as his primary medium?\\" I think anybody who appreciates art in general could appreciate this book and it's contents.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I liked this film, though it took me a while to get into, I love the fact that they are all leading toward an ultimate Avengers movie.  The film got all funky at the beginning of the movie and said I had a bad connection for some reason but reset or dinked with it and it went back to normal.  Kind of pricy to get  a rental for three ninety nine though to have it instantly made it worth while for this evening.  Thought the way they portrayed Asgard was really good as well.
1423136802|5.0|An amazing read and well worth it.  It is a must have to any collection. This boxed set will not only make a great gift for the young teens, but it also makes for an amazing gift for those young at heart or those who love to escape into another reality while reading.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|I really, really liked the first Hangover. I have watched it several times and still enjoy it. This second movie was a huge dissappointment. The jokes and plot were like leftovers that have gone bad. The characters were just annoying this second time around. I don't know why they made such a fuss of Mel Gibson, he might have actually added something to the move. If you don't have Hangover 1, get that movie instead.

1451627289|5.0|Imagine yourself as a child in elementary school.  The day is winding down and you are antsy to get out.  The principal suddenly walks into the classroom and has a quiet word with your teacher.  And suddenly she breaks down crying in front of her students.  This is how JFK's death has been remembered by me.  Stephen King was older than I when this tragedy occurred and I think that he was profoundly affected by it.  The question often comes up, if we could prevent a tragedy in the future that we knew of ahead of time, should we try to stop it?  Stephen King has an answer to this question and a very somber one it is.<br />Early in his career, Stephen King was one of my favorite authors.  But as time went on, his novels seemed weaker and weaker.  The worst I think was 'The Cell' which had me laughing until I just couldn't take anymore and gave up 2/3 through the novel.  What happened to the author of 'The Shining', 'The Stand', 'The Bachmann Books'?  Well I guess he just came back.  I think that this book will be considered Stephen King's masterpiece.  I am not sure if those who do not remember the assasination of Kennedy will ever realize how truly traumatic this was.  Even the protaganist of the novel is born too late to realize it.  But he learns.  The hard way.  I read this entire novel in two days and loved every minute of it.<br />The nation was terribly scarred by the assisnation of JFK much as it was when the Twin Towers came down in September of 2001.  But can we really play god and try to fix the future?  And what of the unintended cnsequences?<br />Welcome back Mr. King.  I have truly missed your wonderful writing.  This novel is truly a wonder
B004W4N55C|2.0|This review would be 5 stars if the developer had made it available for Kindle Fire users.  It seems peculiar that an app that would prove even more useful on tablets seems to be unavailable or incredibly glitchy on many tablets. Why would this item be available to download on the Motorola Xoom but not the Fire?  There is an app available on the Fire through this publisher. But why should I have to pay for an app that is a downgrade from the app on my phone? Seems like a hustle to me...

I am a die hard Megadeth fan, I started hearing them after their So Far, So Good, So What album but instead of buying it I picked up Peace Sells first and I was floored. The next day I picked up So Far...and I have bought every one of their albums on their date of release ever since. Including the autobiography which i read in 24 hours. I must say that this is one that hooked me from seconds into Track 1, Rust in Peace being another I remember doing this to me too. LOVE IT! and if you love Megadeth and Mr. Mustaine's emotional metal....so will YOU!!

B0050SYS5A|1.0|While the quality of the product is top notch, the inherent design is completely flawed. This will only work for people under or around 5 feet tall.<br /><br />The flaw of the product lies in the lenses themselves. Because they are slightly smaller than the original kinect lens, it creates a black barrier around the play area and distorts/shrinks the view instead of expanding it like it should. When I did get the product to work the recognition was jittery and non-responsive. It would keep telling me to return to the play area and my on-screen avatar would flail about wildly.<br /><br />When you install the product onto the kinect, it does a good job of lining up with the kinect itself. I tried re-attaching it several times to make sure there wasn't something I was doing wrong, and I also tried to recalibrate several times. In the kinect settings it shows what the kinect sees, and instead of having a crystal clear picture like before, it was distorted and there was a black ring around the edge which is how I came to this conclusion.<br /><br />Do not buy this product. It does not work.
0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire is a 2009 young-adult science fiction novel by Suzanne Collins, and the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy. Here, the events of the first novel have stirred up unrest in the Districts, and the totalitarian Capitol threatens nearly everyone Katniss knows with death.<br /><br />The Hunger Games was a page-turning affair; Catching Fire is too, mostly. Collins has a lot of creative ideas here, many of which work well, especially in the middle third of the book. It's notably impressive that she can keep a second Hunger Games event reasonably fresh, although its abbreviated length certainly helps.<br /><br />And yet here also Katniss spends page after page mentally whining, absorbed in her own problems, feeling sorry about her situation (that she's moping about her loved ones' fates rather than her own doesn't make it less tiresome). Katniss is also painfully slow on the uptake throughout the book, and is often a hindrance to other people who are trying to get things accomplished. For numerous reasons, she just isn't as sympathetic here as she was in the first book.<br /><br />The real star of Catching Fire is the supporting cast. Whereas Katniss is usually content to take a blunt-instrument approach to her plight, many of the other characters are crafty, creative, and noble, and the reader roots for them. It's too bad the first-person narrative restricts the book to Katniss's perspective, because a great deal of what they're up to is quite a bit more interesting than much of what Katniss has going on.<br /><br />Collins' writing feels somewhat less solid here than in the first book. The story itself is fine, but Collins at times seems more interested in setting up the third book than telling this book's story. Much of the key action in the book is given in summary. The ending is a particularly glaring example, where the reader is given a glossed-over page of twists and revelations without even a proper scene. Additionally, the love triangle featuring two upstanding, devoted young men who don't care how annoying the girl can be is boilerplate for female-fronted young-adult fiction.<br /><br />For all the setup of the first book, Collins still doesn't have anything interesting to say on any of her issues. She still hammers the totalitarian-government-is-bad point, but that government and its leader are never more than one-dimensional villains. Collins again ignores the moral issues of the Hunger Games; indeed, Katniss, who hopes that somebody else kills the people she likes so she won't have to, is nearly all hardened killer here. (The seeds are here to make a point about fighting evil with evil, but Collins doesn't seem the slightest bit inclined in that direction.)<br /><br />Catching Fire is a page-turner. But because of its flaws, it feels shallow, and a page-turner is about all it is. Ultimately, that's just enough to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />3.5 stars rounded up to 4.wo upstanding, devoted young men who don't care how annoying the girl can be is boilerplate for female-fronted young-adult fiction.<br /><br />For all the setup of the first book, Collins still doesn't have anything interesting to say on any of her issues.

It is highly detailed and even has cliff notes from the artists and author the,Robert Kirkman, of the making of each cover which is awesome! But sad to say that amazon book shipping fails again! The cover has what looks like pencil marks all over it, but what I can only guess to be dents from S&H! So collectors beware!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it but would prefer the &quot;ads&quot; would stop after I have downloaded the aps. Otherwise it's a great game.
B005POK858|3.0|First, a word of warning. If you have a Droid X (like me) don't get this game. Ever since downloading it my phone has taken to freezing, crashing, and rebooting itself. If you check the 1-star reviews on Amazon, you'll see that I'm not alone in this issue. I was sad to have to uninstall it; it's actually a fun little game.  Eve of the Genesis (or \\"beginning of the beginning\\" if you want to chuckle when you read the title) is a fun little sprite based RPG that offers quite a bit of welcome diversion as long as you don't expect to much from it. The story is pure JRPG pabulum, complete with imperiled world, slacker-youth-turned-hero, and even a nice dash of random amnesia. The dialogue is atrocious, and the character development is non-existent. So why do I give it 3 stars? Because despite all that, it's an entertaining game, with engaging enough combat to keep you occupied for a few minutes at a time. The game offers a decent array of enemy types, character skills, and pieces of equipment to hold your interest. Combat is pretty quick, and the fact that you're probably only going to be playing for small burst of time (you're not planning to play an RPG on your phone for hours on end, are you?) helps prevent the game from succumbing to the random encounter fatigue that often plagues JRPGs. If you're an RPG fan just looking for an amusing way to spend a few minutes while you wait in line or during commercials, this app gets the job done. If you want an engrossing story, interesting characters, or sharp dialogue that will keep you glued to the screen, look elsewhere.
B00394A4UK|4.0|This book should come with several health warnings.  Firstly, it is a gripping, scary tale and consumes the reader entirely.  You simply can't put it down and once you have started you aren't going to want to do anything else until you are done reading.  Secondly, Dennis Lehane plays with his characters, but he plays with his reader even more.  Halfway through the book, you just don't know who or what to believe anymore, least of all yourself.  Then there is the violence, it is unrelenting and batters you from all sides - bloody murder, psychotic behaviour, manipulative medics and a ferocious storm.  This is one massive roller coaster of a book and for those brave enough, it is an unforgettable ride.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|My 2 year old loves this toy, it is a great buy! But i really wanted to write this review to let you all know that this is WAY overpriced. I got it on amazon about a month ago for 10 dollars!! this is such a rip off! I saw it at walmart 2 days ago for 10 dollars as well. Great toy but dont buy here....it seems like amazon overall is overpriced on legos.
B004H83IG4|2.0|Here's a perfect unbalanced film. Kirsten Dunst's character and, above all, performance totally eclipses what's left of All Good Things. As soon as she disappeared from the story, I wanted to go outside for a walk (and, believe me, that was a courageous thought considering the pouring rain we have here but I wander from the point). Already forgotten. Unfortunately.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I've been using this watch for 1 week. Everything works well, and according to the manual. GPS fix is quick (I think below 1 minute) and accurate. Connection to heart rate monitor works well. No problem with sending data to Internet account. Battery holds well.   Two problems I found so far:  1. There is no date, day of week, and battery level info on the main watch screen in the power saving mode. You have to press a button to get the date. I think it is totally feasible to fit date and other data on the screen, even on 1/2 of the screen for battery saving.  2. There is no backlight in the power saving mode with locked bezel.   This is an expensive watch. Even a $5 watch has date and backlight. I would use this watch as my everyday watch, but not with the above flaws.

I realize the previous reviewers love this movie based upon prior knowledge of the book etc. The movie matches their description. All that I am saying is that it is not a romantic comedy, so if that is what you are looking for, then don't bother with this movie.

Roberta Peters is the best Queen of the Night I've ever heard!!!!
030746363X|5.0|I am a 25 year old male. When I read this book I weighed 206 lbs. I read the book in January 2011. After two months I was down to 190 and in the best shape of my life. My goal was 185 and I have remained to this day in between 184 and 190. The diet is incredible, the techniques to increase your testosterone are amazing as well. Its not a super easy diet, you definitely have to be disciplined, but you see results so fast that it is very unlikely that you will even want to cheat, and there is one cheat day per week, so that usually covers you. As I said, I am 25 years old and very social, so it was hard to limit myself to one cheat day per week, because i would go out with friends drinking and eating all weekend. So I feel I would have seen results even faster had I followed the diet perfectly. I have recommended this book to multiple friends and they have all seen great results as well. I have been off and on with the diet now, I sometimes take weeks off of the diet, I may gain a few pounds here or there, but it is incredible how fast my body will burn that increase as soon as get back on the diet.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|All of the elements that the one and two star reviews hate, I loved. I loved that the movie felt like a mashup of the goonies/sandlot vs. whatever monster movie. Yes, there was profanity, no it's not for children. It's like how Toy Story 3 was not a movie for kids, it was for the generation that grew up with Toy Story. I think this movie was charming and adorable despite the violence that ensued. How did he do that? I don't know, but it was cool!<br /><br /> What I loved about it was it had the charm of the Goonies/the Sandlot, but it was more grown up than that. Movies about friends getting through and somewhat a coming of age film. So what, a monster was thrown in? So what, the monster doesn't even make sense? I don't think the monster was even the point of the movie, but that's my personal opinion. I think people who get hung up on the monster have trouble with letting the movie take them out of reality. Yes, it felt like Cloverfield. But again, I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE POINT. I was personally charmed by the child actors of this movie, I was charmed by the idea of the movie. Others have their opinions.

B004ZNARH4|5.0|I bought this set as a gift for my son, who is a big Pink Floyd fan. When he received it, he opened it and immediately called me to thank me and tell me about all of the things that came with the package. I went by his house a couple of days later, and he opened it to show me and went on and on about it. Overall, we were both pleased with this item. I was pleased with the price and the promptness of delivery.
1451627289|5.0|You know those books that start out with great promise but never live up to it? This is not one of those books.<br /><br />You know those stories that get lost and muddled and sputter to a finish? This is not one of those stories.<br /><br />You know those novels where the author has SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY and they're more than willing to sacrifice both plot and character to say it? Thank God,  this is not one of those either.<br /><br />'11/22/63' wastes no time (ha-ha, I know) dropping you right into the story. The main premise is introduced in the first  25 pages and then we're off and running, following Jake Epping on his first trip to 1958, reliving those years through his eyes, the eyes of a modern man given an experience more than 50 years in the past, and given the chance to correct some grevious wrongs. Given the chance, even, to change history as we know it, to save John F. Kennedy from an assassin's bullet.<br /><br />'11/22/63' is told in a no-nonsense style that reads like a breath of fresh air. King captures both the sweet and the sour of that bygone age, giving Jake the nostalgia of an unforgettable mug of ten-cent root beer and the up-close look at the hatred that boiled under the surface...and that's just the beginning. In his journey, Jake will learn much. He'll fall in love and his heart will break and he'll face the resistance of an obdurate past. History, you see, does not want to be changed...and the bigger the change, the more it will resist.<br /><br />With '11/22/63' King tackles a big subject and sets himself up for a big fall should he stumble. But page after page his step remains sure and confident, first striding forward, then jogging, then in the last 100 pages or so running hard and breathlessly to an ending that is both fitting and satisfying.<br /><br />The result is a novel that delivers on every inch of promise it makes and then some, a story that never feels bogged down or too heavy to support itself. The result its not only King's best book in a long time, its one of the best time-travel stories I've read, and a fitting, honourable perspective on one of America's most painful moments.<br /><br />I wasn't there when JFK was shot. I wasn't even alive yet. The real magic of '11/22/63,' the real time-travel paradox it created, is that it made me feel like I was right there, living every moment in the Land of Ago.vel stories I've read, and a fitting, honourable perspective on one of America's most painful moments.

B005IZLPKQ|2.0|I wanted to love this movie because well....it's Cpt. America! But I was disappointed rather quickly...I'm not sure if this is just me but I felt like the movie was rushed after the first 30 minutes of the movie, that the plot moved faster and did less to captivate the audience. The biggest disappointment has to be the end fight that the movie builds up immensely only to have it be very brief. What a terrible ending! I honestly could not understand people's obsession with this movie. I realize it is Cpt. America and it is somewhat patriotic but if you make that argument then our country deserves better. Do yourself a favor and rent this or wait till it is dirt cheap to see it.

B004A8ZWVK|1.0|It's a feel good movie for people who are the kind of racists that that say they can't be racist because they have a black friend. If you want a pat on the head for not being part of slavery or someone to compliment you on how much progress we've made because you weren't part of a horrendous time in history.   I know this sounds harsh, but considering Stocktett stole this story from her own hired help, that's disgusting. Don't believe me? Enter \\"the help author sued\\" into a search engine and check out Abelene Cooper's story. Stocktett couldn't even bother to radically change the character's name.   But that's the real racist gist of it. The maids have no power. Getting fired is supposed to be the climatic ending when in reality it's a terrible punishment. It's an exercise of dominance and the maids have no autonomy. Would you cheer if someone who was white was fired for no real reason? The movie however, wants you to cheer on this \\"happy\\" ending. Stockton wants you to be happy that because you acknowledged something happened, not because it changed things or that her own personal behavior represents progress.  More importantly, she wants your money for telling someone else's story without their permission. Abelene Cooper along with Stockett's relatives, Carol and Robert Stockett III, who remain her employers agree.   It's disgusting how many people will unquestioningly buy into this as an example of progress when it exemplifies the cultural differences in our country begat by racism.   Most of you will still love the book and movie, claiming this shouldn't affect the creative merit. \\"What about biographies,\\" some of you may cry. Biographies don't cast themselves as pieces of fiction with moral impetus. Stockett is trying to impress upon you that this her sole work of creative merit as well as move you emotionally by the moral characters, but if they're actually really characters who are playing victim to Stockett in the exact fashion she's criticizing (that they have no place, their opinion is of no value, you can't do as you want with them), then you're celebrating hypocrisy.  There are so many books and movies that tackle this exact topic, that celebrating one that depends on the exploitation it tries to criticize is not only in poor taste, but your cheating yourselves. Why not buy gold-painted tin and call it gold? Why not get surgery in a back alley somewhere in the third-world instead of a reputable hospital? Why bother getting a book or movie by someone who actually created it rather than someone who just copies other people?  -----  Edit 12/7/2011: It's really amazing how many people are offended by my review.   Are you offended because you think creative fiction should be based on factual lives fact-by-fact instead of just inspired? Are you offended because I pointed out that I dislike the movie based on some substantial reasons that you personally don't value? Are you offended because for some reason you think this is a personal attack on you?   It's interesting that many of the reviews for the movie include confusion over why people of color don't like the movie, \\"How could they not?!\\" Then you read a negative review, and you can't stop fuming. If you truly believe that everyone's entitled to their own opinion, you might as well leave this review alone.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|This has everything I expect from a Clint Eastwood action movie.  I've sat and watched it with friends and family, something for everyone.  The plot about the ageing special agent fighting back to regain position as a presidental body guard against an inspired amost cartoon villian is very entertaining, worth repeated viewing for all fans of Mr. Eastwoods work

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games was a fascinating read. Through the perspective of a teenager (Katniss) set in the future where the government (the Capitol) controls 13 (well 12) districts surrounding it. The Capitol is all high and mighty and no one shall defy it...or else. In order to keep things running smoothly and to ensure their power over the districts, they require each district to send a boy and girl to an arena where they fight to the death.(Yes, it sounds morbid and horrifying for a young adult series, but it's good I promise.) It's more than surviving, it's staying true to yourself as a human being in the arena, no matter what the government throws at you.  This series has three books, all amazing, all worth the read. And like I said in my title, they're addictive.   Now read this book...\\"and may the odds be ever in your favor!\\"

0451163516|4.0|First of all I love Ken Follett. However, I have just recently just discovered him with his most recent books like Pillars of the Earth and Fall of Giants (which are also amazing). I was told by a patient that I must read this book, he was right. Although it took me a while to get into it (felt like the first 2 chapters went on forever), it was really worth it in the end. This dude likes making his stories back in the day of World Wars. With his combination of factual events and fictional main characters, it makes for a good read while learning at the same time!  All in all...plow through the first chapter or so and you'll enjoy it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had never played the game before I bought the Fire.  I am now addicted.  The ease of play and simple touch controls allows me to quickly replay a level.

B004UXUUDA|5.0|I've never written a review before but Sara's Key truly should not be missed, and there are many films that should. Seeing as I have wasted more of my life than I like to admit with those, I would feel ungrateful and stupid to not take 2 seconds to let you know that IMHO Sara's Key is the exact opposite end of the spectrum, life enriching art that makes you think.  I can't remember seeing better acting, and I've been trying to since the first time I saw it.  The score is moving.  Direction is masterful, and the story is compelling.  My sister (who doesn't speak french) recommended it strongly and obviously I'm glad that I listened to her.  The story(ies) is(are) well covered in other reviews, so I'll just agree with the other reviewers, don't miss it.

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I have to say this movie is very inspiring to many women. I think it makes women (black women) especially to confront there feelings on the subject of racism. I know hurt and discomfort filled the theater when we were introduced to the character of the racist Hilly. It made me understand more on why SOME black people struggle with loving who they are. It was hard to love yourself and tell yourself you are worth it when your employer/owner tells you that you are not worth it in so many words. Black women have carried that pain with them for generations and generations. It depicted white women in a whole different level as overly confident, obnoxious and completely self absorbed. Of course all white people are not like that, I felt it took black and white people back to a place where they both felt a little uncomfortable. It confronted racism and the literal hurt of how the words and degrading atmosperes could bring one race to its knees. It was not the characters that needed changing, because they did a wonderful job, I truly would have loved to have slugged Hilly. It was the story line I think there could have been a little more of a special something to the ending to make it just right.
B00008V5VN|5.0|An uncompromising masterpiece. This is the best way to describe Sleep's final record, Dopesmoker. Apart from the legends and myts surrounding this controversial record, this 63 minutes long song, would appel only for true rockers and many would not get it. But those who do and understand it, will surely regard it as an experience, rather than just a 'normal' record that you will listen to kill time.   Through out their short time as a band, the trio from San Jose California, had released some of the most uncompromising records ever. However, though Volume One is a great doom metal record, it's the second album Holy Mountain which define's them best. Tracks like Dragonout, the title track, From Beyond and Evil Gypsy/Solomon's Theme, established Sleep as one of the best, if not the best, stoner metal band of all time. But, there was still much more to come.  After the release of there second album, Sleep decided to release the third album. But instead of a normal record with several songs, Sleep's new album was just a one song, 63 minutes long! Unfortunately, the refusal of the record company to relase this album, eventually led to the break up of the band.  After the disappointing Jerusalem, justice was done with this release, Dopesmoker. After almost a decade, the fans had the opportunity to listen to this stoner metal classic, which tells the  story of a procession of weed to a mystical land.  Needless to say this song, features the great musical qualities of the band members. Matt Pike is at his best here. A great guitar player, no one plays that slow heavy sound, better then him. This apart the three exceptional solos. On the other hand, you can't under estimate the great qualities of Chris Hakius and Al Cisneros. A good heavy metal band always needs a good rhythm section. Here no exception. With regards to vocals, Al Cisneros gave a great performance here.  A true masterpiece. 5 stars out of 5.
030788743X|4.0|Cline's Ready Player One (RPO) is an interesting read.  It picks up on the economic crisis, projecting a long downward slide from it, while maintaining the same level of technological development as a premise.  Cline's prose is clever and not overly flowery, although at times the plot line treads the realm of cliche (in a sense, the book mirrors the plot line of Goonies, although both works basically take up the Campbellian \\"hero's journey\\").  The love of and references to eighties pop culture was a pleasant nod to a lot of readers that seem to have grown up with a sense of wonder brought about by eighties technological optimism (WarGames and Robocop aside).  I think it's a heck of a debut novel.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|I have been a Megadeth fan for a long time. First, I got into the classic's, Peace Sells, So Far so Good so What, Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction. With these albums, Megadeth along with Slayer and Metallica had created the blue print of a new genere of metal which later became known as Thrash Metal. But, in the mid-90's Megadeth experienced a creative decline with albums like Cryptic Writings and Risk.  Despite this, after a short break up, Megadeth were back in form again with their fantastic release, The System has Failed. Scince then, Megadeth had never disappointed again. Th1re3en, is no exception.   The same as The System has Failed, United Abominations and Endgame,once again, the new album features great playing from Dave Mustaine and co, and great lyrics. With regards to the latter, the lyrics of We the People and New World Order in particular stand out.  The album, features a mixture of the old classic Megadeth sound, and the more recent sound that the band has developed through out the years. For example, Public Enemy No 1 is a typical melodic Megadeth song from the Countdown of Extinction era. On the other hand, Fast Lane features the modern Megadeth sound, very similar to the previous record. Other great tracks are the opener, Sudden Death, Guns, Drugs & Money and Millennium of the Blind.  However, the last track 13, is the one which stands out. A great song, very emotional, good lyrics and great playing. This is one of the best Megadeth song's ever.   An awesome album. 4 stars out of 5. Highly recommendable.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I'm VERY pleased with this cover for my Kindle Fire.  It is very handsome and fits very well!  The material it is made of seems to be of nice quality.
B006GLQIVC|3.0|I love this show. I watch it every week and always long for more. This week wasn't different. I cannot wait for the next episode.<br /><br />However, rather than giving this the usual 5-stars, I am only giving it 3 this week. The episode was very grim. We saw two murders and subsequent dismemberment. Also, the annoying ghost/mistress occupied way too much time. Her character is very bothersome, and the actress simply lacks the power of the others.<br /><br />There was a powerful moment in the show when the home security guard confronted hubby over certain suspicions. It was powerful. Best of all, hubby no longer sees the maid as a young seductress. That was almost getting old, and it unnecessarily suggested that men only want sex.<br /><br />But you can tell the writers sort of lost direction in this episode when they turned to the tired and cliched \\"girl on girl\\" action for a thrill. Come on - you guys can do much better than that.<br /><br />Also, the conclusion of the episode suggests the development of some bizarre (and also well traveled) religious plot involving the Anti-Christ. That would be unfortunate.<br /><br />So for these shortcoming, I gave this episode a 3 instead of a 5. I still love the show, however.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|5 stars for content, but I ordered this thinking I would be getting the DVDs with 4 different sleeves, like a version I already own. I bought this one as a Christmas gift and when I received it WEEKS later... It was one small case with 4 disks, rather than being in the more box-set style. The pictures on this item is completely different than what I got.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|Just finished reading this book. I really enjoyed it. The writing style is very easy to get into, and the banter is witty. I know most people will probably disagree with me, but I just don't like Travis. That's my main problem with the book. I know the author meant to make him a little crazy, but I see him as more psychotic than sexy. If he were my boyfriend, I'd honestly be scared. I also felt quite sorry for Parker, who I thought was a very redeemable character throughout and didn't deserve the treatment and lack of character development he got.
0670022950|5.0|Steven Pinker has always been a brilliant and insightful author, ably bridging the gap between behavioral science research and the audience of intelligent laypersons. The Better Angels of Our Nature, however, is by far his most ambitious and successful book---a book destined for greatness. Like most great books, the message is simple and clear, and the author spends most of his time and energy defending and elaborating on a few key points. Immensely knowledgeable in all the behavioral sciences, and possessing considerable statistical skills, Pinker ranges over a huge swath of modern research, virtually every page overflowing with factual information.<br /><br />The last book that I read that I admired almost as much as this was Jared Diamond's Germs, Guns and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (1997). I loved Diamond's book even though I had some reservations concerning the validity of his explanation of the distribution of poverty and wealth in the modern world. I have even more reservations concerning Pinker's explanation of the dramatic decline of violence in modern society, but this does not diminish the value of his contributions in my eyes (and it certainly should not in yours, dear potential reader).<br /><br />Pinker begins by tracing six major turning points in human history (he calls them, rather inaccurately, \\"trends\\"). First was the transition from hunter-gather to sedentary and agricultural living some 10,000 years ago (yes, it was that recently!). The second was the transition from feudalism to modern society in the Middle Ages, which initiated a five hundred year \\"Civilizing Process\\" (to use the words of the great sociologist Norbert Elias) leading to a ten to fifty-fold reduction in the amount of violence in society. The third was the European Enlightenment and the Age of Reason that this unleashed, leading to the virtual elimination of socially sanction forms of violence (e.g., torture, public hangings, dueling, witch burnings, cruelty to animals). The fourth transition was the end of international war among the great powers after World War II, and the fifth was the decline in civil wars, genocides, and repression by autocrats since the end of the Cold War. Pinker's final transition is the widespread expression of faith in human rights embodied in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br /><br />Pinker ascribes the decline of violence to \\"four better angels,\\" that form part of the psychological repertoire of Homo sapiens. These are empathy, self-control, a moral sense, and the faculty of reason. A fair fraction of the book is devoted to showing that we in fact have these \\"better angels,\\" using modern behavioral game theory and experimental psychology and economics. The rather quaint notion, fashionable until just a couple of decades ago, that humans are basically selfish and uncaring except for close kin, and that humans have a natural and irrepressible instinct for aggression and mayhem, is eloquently and effectively contradicted by contemporary social science research.<br /><br />The better angels of our human nature do not operate, however, in a social vacuum. Rather, Pinker asserts, there are five historical forces that have led to the triumph of empathy, self-control, a moral sense, and the faculty of reason over the equally powerful human thirst to exploit and dominate other groups, and to take revenge against those who have offended us with no sense of self-control, temperance, or forgiveness. The first of these historical forces he calls \\"Leviathan\\" (following Hobbes)---the rise of the state and judiciary that enforces a monopoly of coercion, and funnels disputes between individuals and groups through the judicial apparatus. The second is commerce, the globalization of which starting in the sixteen century, which changes international relations into a positive sum game that is crippled by war. The third historical force is feminization, through which the interests and values of women are increasing respected and generalized to both sexes. The fourth is cosmopolitanism, including literacy, mobility, and mass media, which lead people increasingly to understand the mind-sets and desires of others unlike themselves, and to expand their circle of sympathy to larger and larger groupings of individuals. The fifth, says Pinker, is the \\"escalator of reason,\\" through which people can learn from the past the futility of acting out their primitive urges, and rather turn to peaceful solutions to their problems.<br /><br />Perhaps the most surprising, and welcome, aspect of Pinker's new work is that it is implicitly a devastating nail-in-the-coffin critique of the brand of evolutionary psychology with which Pinker has identified for many years. The brand of evolutionary psychology initiated by Lida Cosmides and John Tooby began with with a high-precision and effective attack on mainstream psychology and sociology, which they called the Standard Social Sciences Model (SSSM). According to the SSSM, the human mind is a blank slate at birth (nota bene: the title of one of Pinker's books was The Blank Slate), and individual psychological characteristics are determined purely by the dominant culture in which the individual is raised. \\"Human nature,\\" as Karl Marx proclaimed in the Theses on Feuerbach, \\"is the sum of social relations\\" (Marxism and mainstream social theory agreed on this central tenet). Thus, in a culture that approves of violence there will be lots of violence, which in a culture that approves of pacific relations, there will be peace. In a society that recognizes differences between the sexes, there will be exhibited exactly those differences so recognized. And so on.<br /><br />The SSSM would be a mixed blessing if it were true. On the one hand, we could engineer culture to produces people who are kind, considerate, and helpful to one another. On the other hand, a totalitarian state could produce people who willingly follow the dictates of Big Brother, inevitably rat on the deviations of their friends and family members from the Socially Desirable Behavior, and live on hay and cider while their masters dined on caviar and Champagne (Yves Montand one sang \\"Il faut une chasuble d'or pour chanter Beni Createur. Nous en tissons, grands de l'Eglise, et nous, pauvres canuts, n'ont pas de chemises.\\")<br /><br />However, the SSSM is surely not true, as we have learned from the work of Cosmides and Tooby, followed by a few decades of behavioral economic and psychology. Just a Marx's materialism is Hegel's idealism \\"stood on its head,\\" so Cosmides and Tooby's evolutionary psychology is the SSSM stood on its head: genes are everything and culture is a palsied epiphenomenon, the instantaneous representation of the human gene pool.<br /><br />However, Pinker's explanation of the remarkable decline in violence that hallmarks human prehistory and history has an explanation in which genes and culture interact in a rather balanced manner (this is called \\"gene-culture coevolution\\"). Humans have empathy and a moral sense not because these virtues are impressed upon us as blank slates, but because we evolved in such a manner that those with empathy and a moral sense had more offspring that the sociopaths, and they passed the genes that precondition empathy and morality on to their offspring. Culture is thus not an epiphenomenon that is completely subservient so social structure, but a driving force in the transformation of social structure.<br /><br />The problem with Pinker's argument is that it leaves us with a sense of post hoc propter hoc. Humans became nicer in many different ways at once over the years (the Civilizing Process) and we really cannot say why it came out the way it did. I think Pinker's stress on the role of the state in reducing violence is undoubtedly correct, but why did the growth of state power not lead to the sort of totalitarian despotism that was so feared in the early twentieth century, and so hoped for by the Communists, Nazi, and Fascist states of the world? Why has cosmopolitanism led to the spread of liberating information technologies, rather than highly efficient despotic control of information by an authoritarian state?<br /><br />One could answer that the human drive for freedom and dignity, a legacy from our hunter-gatherer past, accounts for the control of the means of coercion by the mass of citizens (note that in a fully efficient coercive state, there is no violence at all--although there might be some ineluctable \\"reeducation\\")? I think the answer probably lies in the nature technology.<br /><br />The egalitarian nature of simple hunter-gatherer societies was predicated on the existence of lethal weapons, making it impossible, in an age before property, for an individual to control the group through force, because anyone can kill anyone else, catching him by surprise, at low persona cost. With the advent of sedentary and agricultural communities, private property permitted a ruling class to control the masses by force, and primitive egalitarianism was completely eclipsed in the human world. Only with the development of the handgun and bored rifle in the eighteenth and later centuries prevented the hegemony of a ruling class of mounted warriors. The age of democracy was at the same time the age of foot soldiers and the infantry-based army.<br /><br />In thinking about Pinker's argument, I am led to think that he understates the role of information technology in the decline of violence. When my Jewish ancestors were murdered in Polish pogroms, their tormenters were told that Jews sacrificed Christians on their Holy Days, and their unleavened bread was an admixture of wheat and Christian blood. My mother-in-law recounted to me the following story. As a young bride, she took the bus every Saturday to visit her husband where he was stationed. After a couple of weeks, she became friendly with another young bride in the same situation, and thereafter they sat together passing the time talking during the trip. One day my mother-in-law mention that she was Jewish. Her friend, completely horrified, pushed her away in disgust, and asked her where her horns were, which her priest had assured her all Jewish women had under the kerchiefs. My point is that now you just can't get away with manipulating people into believing such falsehoods because there is no power so despotic as to be able to shields its people from the truth.embers from the Socially Desirable Behavior, and live on hay and cider while their masters dined on caviar and Champagne (Yves Montand one sang \\"Il faut une chasuble d'or pour chanter Beni Createur.

My point is that now you just can't get away with manipulating people into believing such falsehoods because there is no power so despotic as to be able to shields its people from the truth.
B005J7K950|5.0|I've been waiting for this DVD for decades.It's my absolute favorite version of Metropolis.Moroder did a fantastic job with the color tinting and music.I think even Fritz Lang would approve.If someone who was not aware of this great film saw only the Moroder version,they would think it is the coolest,hippest film ever!<br />  Now if they would come out with Cobra Woman and other Maria Montez movies.....
6305428042|5.0|The dvd arrived in a very timely manner, the dvd was perfect and I would buy again.  Its great to be able to find movies that you cant find to buy in stores.
B0052GACNM|5.0|A great follow-up to the first Duets CD.  Tony is great as always, and the music selections and duet artists are very nice.  If you liked the first CD, you'll enjoy this one, too.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|This is a fun app for free and has about 12 puzzles. I downloaded it for free on my kindle fire and it keeps freezing up and force exiting. Ended up uninstalling and will try another app.
B006BQI1V2|5.0|My husband and I watched this last week. I had heard such great things about the book, so I was a little worried that the movie would fall short. It didn't!!! We were moved by this movie! So powerful and touching.
B003E6K1VK|4.0|I bought this specifically for use with my AKG Q701s. I've only had it for about a couple of days, but i've gotta say it's pretty nice. It's easy to use, has a nice minimalistic design going for it, and supposedly a ridiculously long battery life on a full charge (80 hours). I still have yet to see if that's forreal or not, but it's good to know that it's possible. I've read a couple reviews saying that the menu was complicated to use, but after going through the menus myself, i personally don't see what's so complicated about it. I almost kinda wish there were more menu options... kinda. The only menu option i really played around with was the EQ (bass boost). Not anywhere near as intricate as some other EQs that i've used, but i liked that FiiO kept it simple. The only thing i really have to complain about is that the max volume level isn't as loud as i was hoping for it to be. I don't know if it's because of the headphones i'm using or what, but i just wish it would go a little bit louder. I'm not saying that this thing doesn't get loud, because there were some songs that i was listening to where i definitely had to turn the volume down to be able to enjoy what i was listening to, so i guess it depends on what kind of a setup you've got going. Anyways, I like this thing a lot so far. Only four stars thO because of the whole volume thing.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I have been using this case for about two weeks now, and continue to be happy with my purchase. I am more than satisfied with the look and feel of this product; I am not sure what folks were expecting in a tablet case, but I have tried out my fair share of smartphones cases and felt like this case compared positively to those. The case adds little heft or weight to my Fire, and feels very comfortable in my hand -- including when standing during packed NYC subway rush hour commutes. I enjoy the feel of the interior felt as I hold the case open, and I am pleased with the grip that the outer case provides as I walk with it closed. I have also had no problems utilizing the \\"stand\\" feature of the case; simply bend the cover into a triangle and match it with the notch on the back of the case.  The only reason why I am giving 4 stars to this case is because I have yet to (and hope not to) drop my Fire, and thus cannot speak to its protection against falls. However, I do frequently throw my Fire into my backpack along with a hodgepodge of other potentially damaging items, and the case has stood up well to this abuse while leaving the Fire untouched.  If you are seriously considering this case, I absolutely suggest that you at least give this case a whirl. If you aren't pleased, then by all means take advantage of Amazon's generous return policy.  It should also be noted that while I initially pre-ordered this case for $39.99, Amazon did provide me with a $10 voucher when the product's price dropped to $29.99 after release. A price, I might add, that is significantly less than the case I just purchased to protect my iPhone 4S.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|I like reviews that get straight to the point, so here it is:  Quick about me:  physician, 26 weeks pregnant with baby #2  Pros:    The host is motivating without being overly peppy and annoying  The host is actually pregnant herself  You get a good workout, but it's broken up so you don't feel overworked  She actually programs time to drink water as a part of the workout (only about 10 sec segments)  Cons:  It is only the host by herself in a room, therefore only 1 difficulty level (unlike other DVD's I've tried)  If you're used to watching HD TV, you will notice a detriment in video and sound quality  I was a Master's level swimmer through my first trimester...this was a good workout for me (not easy)  Other Thoughts:  Don't get this if you haven't been working out already  exercises: aerobics, squats, kicks, modified push ups, tricep dips, Pilates, about 5% yoga
6300215954|5.0|...it is very difficult to find Region 1 DVD version. This VHS will copy over to DVD and then plays beautifully. Or just watch the VHS if you still have a player. This is a longer movie so there are two cassettes.

B005ORVMT2|1.0|Rush, Fly by Night and the Farewell to kings DVD have glitches or wrong mixing problems, some fans have reported some other problems in these 3 boxes. I'm truly dissapointed. Besides, the dynamic range on every disc is reduced in order to make the albums louder... what a shame! Everybody has a stereo with a volume control so I don't see the point of messing up this so important characteristic of a recording. These remasters are not better than the 90's ones.  I read an statement of the band at RUSH.COM about these issues, talking about replacing wrong discs, good! But I fear they won't consider us internet buyers, or international buyers (Mexico Here!). Fingers crossed :'( (For the firts time since I follow this band, I feel robbed... it's not a 9.99 dollars buying, I spent much much more on this)

B004JMSIRC|4.0|4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />Slam bang, rip roaring, old school comic book hero movie, that's \\"Iron Man! The purest of comic book movies, who has a message, but does not overburden the audience with to much emotional baggage.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is \\"Iron Man,\\" he may be the brightest acting star of his generation, as he can play almost any part, & he plays the wealthy industrialist, swashbuckling, chick magnet, Tony Stark to perfection, with a wink of his eye! Jeff Bridges, who is also one of the greatest actors of his generation, plays the double dealing, money hungry, evil surrogate father figure, Obadiah Stane, of Tony Stark, with malicious glee, as he plans to take Tony's inventions & sell them to both sides of the fence. Tony's personal aid/secretary, Pepper Potts ( Gwyneth Paltrow) is perfect in her role as the faithful secretary, that is thinly disguises that she is in love with her boss. She is vulnerable, yet ready to take control of any situation that is bestowed on her with total competence. These three actors make \\"Iron Man,\\" sturdily solid, great popcorn entertainment for those who want to escape for a couple of hours in their lives!<br /><br />Recommended to everyone who loves a thrill ride of a film, with a great confrontational finale!

B001FB55H6|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />Dark, twisted, deeply complex, undeniably the baser side of the human condition, or should I say the comic book hero condition, is Zack Snyder's, \\"Watchmen.\\" Though the new Batman films have approached the subject matter in the duality of comic book heroes as imperfect people, living a lie as the perfect hero, no film touches this subject matter as the bottomless black vortex that is, \\"Watchmen.\\" It's characters so disillusioned with their selves & the world, that it's hard to tell many of them apart from the bad guys their supposed to be protecting the world from. It is also a commentary of the Vietnam era, & contemplates President Nixon role as a leader if he was still in office in 1985. It does not look at individual criminals, but the human race as a whole, that is so corrupt, it is destined to implode on it's self from the weight of it's own decadence. There is violent murder, rape, lies, greed, vigilantism, hate, sex, loneliness, mass destruction, & worse of all, hypocrisy, in spades in this film. There are moments of pure transcendence, as \\"Watchmen\\" becomes more than just a comic book hero film, but a film that speaks of absolutes, if man kind is to survive as a species.<br /><br />This film is a joy to look at, some of the most potently spectacular scenes I've ever seen in a film of this type, mostly with \\"Dr. Manhattan. The scene where he is killing the Vietcong by the dozens, as a glowing, giant, god of destruction is just jaw dropping, both in the beauty & imagination of the scene, & the terror it brings with it. A true metaphor of what the Vietcong most of thought about America, charging into their country with weapons of destruction. The scenes on Mars, are truly awe inspiring, as Dr. Manhattan prefers the lifeless planet to a planet filled with humans bent on their own genocide, & the destruction of earth it's self. Other scenes too, of a smaller, but just as tragic scope. Rorschach being told by his mother she wishes he would not of been born after having sex with a john. Rorschach biting the ear off a bully, was pure unadulterated viciousness. The scene where he finds the little girl in the wood burner, & the dogs chewing, fighting, over her leg, & his vengeance not only on the dogs, but her killer is absolutely brutal. The Comedian, killing the pregnant Vietnamese woman, who was carrying his baby. He then looked at Dr. Manhattan who was shocked, & told him, he could've of stopped him anytime, but didn't. Dr. Manhattan's self startling realization that this was true. The Comedian hired by his own country to kill it's President. Yes, this is a film with a message, a deeply dark message, a true message, that super heroes mean nothing in a world that is ran by greed & corruption, by man. That only man can save mankind, & no other force, earthly or not, can change that. This is \\"Watchmen.\\"born after having sex with a john.

B005K2XRYE|4.0|This sleeve is a nice fit for the Kindle Fire. It is a snug, secure fit so I think anyone with arthritis or something similar may find something looser would be easier for them to use as a case. But for others this sleeve works beautifully. I do wish the Velcro flap closure laid a bit more flat against the sleeve. I find it sticks out a bit and when I place my Kindle in a handbag or tote, sometimes the flap catches on the side and opens up. I am hoping with more use it will get a little bit more \\"worn in\\" and lay flatter with time. However these are very small issues. As a whole, it's a quality made case with nice coloring and quality made. The stitching is well done and the soft red lining keeps the screen from being scratched.<br /><br />I purchased the Gunmetal/White/Robin colored sleeve and it is exactly as pictured online. It actually looks much nicer in person than in the pictures. A very nice sleeve if you're looking for something to protect your Kindle Fire.
B004LROUNG|2.0|This book is not John Grisham at his best.  I found it a dry read.  It took me forever to get through.  It had none of the excitement that I have been used to in his books.  Usually I can have a good book read in 2-3 days.  This book took me over a week to read.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|I love this movie. Every Sci-Fi movie doesn't have to be serious. This one is fun, sometimes gory, sometimes silly, but always amusing. The characters may not be deep but I enjoy watching them.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|Excellent, brand new Blue Ray disc for a steal of a price. I would gladly buy this product at this price any time again.
0786915749|4.0|This is your typical fantasy adventure story and that is precisely why many kids and young adults will love it; they can relate to the characters and story. The writing style is easy and the pace \\"fun\\" and keeps you involved every step of the way. There might be loose holes here and there but it'll serve the purpose unless the reader has to have every single detail written.  The characters are very likable and each has their own characteristics just as most RPGs would. My favorite is Tas and Flint as I find myself relating to them a lot more. And don't be surprise if you find yourself shedding a few tears because that's how the story is set up to be :)  I won't go into too much detail as there are plenty already. Give this simple, light but very enjoyable and memorable series a shot. You will most likely not regret it. For the kids, they'll find similarities in RPG games no doubt :) Enjoy!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Of all the weather apps I tried this one was the easiest to set up.  It gives  the current conditions and accurately forecast the weather for my zip code.  I am very pleased with this app and it was free for my kindle fire.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight is so well directed and acted that it easily grabs attentions and maintains it throughout the entire film. Ledger does an amazing job and really embodies the psychotic nature of the Joker. Plus being in blu-ray, the visual effects are outstanding! Highly worth adding to the collection and easily rewatched!
B005V20JKI|5.0|Great fun and graphics but it cradles often on the htc glacier.  Also looks great on my color nook.  The game is fun.  The music is good too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is not fancy but works well. My husband and I both use it pretty much every day to keep track of weather here and where our family live.
B005Z271Y6|3.0|Amazing and Disappointing!  Never thought the two would go together in a single sentence let slone describe a single entity, but this is exactly what this BluRay disc is.  I was terribly disappointed when I popped in the disc and played it only to feel cheated by this horrible horrible video transfer that can only be described as VHS quality. The better 'hi-def' YouTube videos at 720p has better details, and the pixelations were unforgivable. I am left standing pondering of the chances that the DVD would have had a better video-quality since, unfortunately, the BluRay players activate their 'upscaling' feature only for DVDs but not for BlyRays which, in this case, sorely needed it.   The audio quality too, though the lable claims to be DTS-HD, was found wanting. Her vocals were not as rich as you hear from her CD but the sheer power and melody of her voice more than makes up for it.  To summarise, you don't need me #or anyone else for that matter# to tell you that the concert was simply amazing! Her \\"someone like you\\" alone was worth the price of admission. I was, however, left yearning for the audio-visual immersiveness of the 'An evening with the Dixie-Chicks' DVD --- a disc that the producers should have taken a leaf off of instead of dumping this shoddy product on the people who make their paycheque. Rest assured you will not be disappointed as Adele takes you away into her musical reverie and almost makes you forget the shoddy audio-visual production.  #5 stars for the concert, 1 star for the shoddy production#
B004UXUUDA|5.0|I read this book when it first came out, giving it 5* in my own personal reading journal. However, when the movie came out, I didn't want to see it on the big screen. When reading the book, I felt the pain, sorrow, and sadness of the whole wartime period, as well as the impact on future generations. No action is ever lost in time. After watching the DVD, I felt the same emotions as those felt when I read the book. The acting was excellent. However, the subtitles for the extensive French scenes took some getting used to. I understand such native dialogue added to the reality of the story, and the English subtitles certainly moved the plot along. In conclusion, if you liked the book, you will like this movie.
B005V20JKI|2.0|fun game but the game freezes a lot. sometimes after getting a muffin or killing a monster. other times the controls do not respond, few times after getting a muffin your are still walking even if you fingers are not on the button
0060899220|5.0|My significant other loaned this book to me.  He manages a restaurant, and I found it to be an interesting way to get to know what he does at work.  Stories that seem hilarious to me are real life for him, such as the grillman getting high during a break or having an employee go AWOL on a bender.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone dating someone in the industry.  Anthony Bourdain is an entertaining story teller.  This book is accessible for the general public, appreciated by lovers of food, and dear to the hearts of the ones in the hot kitchen.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|He's what current music artists should be! He has the charm, the swagger, and his voice is out of this world. His vocals are brilliant and each song could stand as its own single. He sings, he writes, he produces his own music, he plays a ton of instruments, there's nothing he can't do. My personal favorites are Grenade and Talking to the Moon because it's very emotional, and you can feel the desperation in his voice. It's very believable. His music is amazing, but it's even better live. He doesn't shortcut any of his songs; he sings every single (high) note on his CD, and not an octave lower. HE has the best voice in the industry, and deserves world wide success! He's already won 1 grammy and is nominated for another 6 for this album!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have never had so much fun playing solitaire. Nor have I ever played it so much. Plus you can't beat free. There are ads in between games though.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|As I was anticipating the delivery of this cover and my Kindle Fire, I read the early reviews for this and I was afraid I was going to return it due to the bad reviews.  I am not sure what some people were expecting from this but it is exactly what it says it is.  I own a Droid Incredible and the hard case I have for my phone reminds me of this cover.  The back of this is a hard plastic that is shaped exactly like the Fire.  The front of this cover is also hard but it folds and has a felt lining on the inside.  I think I will still get a stand for it because it doesn't feel very stable when I use the folded portion as a stand.  I paid 40$ for this in October but Amazon credited my account 10$ in November.  For 30$ I feel I got a good deal.
B005B0QYMM|4.0|I love horrors, but there are so many bad ones out there, even many of the much hyped 'better' releases can be a massive disappointment, so I wasn't over hopeful that Grave Encounters would be anything more special than a good B Grade horror, and maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much, I wasn't expecting anything, and found myself totally enjoying it. Ok the beginnings a little B Grade & an obvious take off of Ghost Adventures & I'm sure Zac & the boys just loved it, & I think they would also like the darker route the film started to go down once the lights went out, I know I did. There's plenty of scares, creepy moments & the actings not bad either. If you want to see an original horror then look no further as this ticks all the right boxes !
B0067Q42BY|4.0|a really good twist on a fun game. the story element brings a different dimension encouraging conversation with other players in the house
B005I6EU48|5.0|This is the perfect cover for my new Fire.  I didn't want anything trendy-looking, too quick to go out of fashion.  I opted for this beautiful cover and it's even more beautiful in person.  It does look exactly like a fine, leather book.  :)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Just like the weather app I have on my iphone. It's quick, has nice graphics, and lots of weather info and extras. Only thing different is no map but not a big deal to me.<br /><br />Update: Map feature has been added.

0740785508|5.0|Dear Amazonians, thank you for a rapid delivery of  a beautifully produced book with a well defined structure and sequence.

B005N95JO0|1.0|Boy, I do not like what I am reading in these reviews of these new re-masters. In his book, Life, Keith said he often wiped the original mix tape so no one could mess with them later.

The history of the Stones need some real help....Keith, Keith what you doin' (whistle whistle)......by the way, this review got roped in with all the other issues of this BUT to top it all off: you mean to tell me they put this terrible sounding, distorted issue in a deluxe box? Tell me this cannot be true?
0307474275|4.0|This book is entertaining and keeps going from beginning to end. Its amazing though that some people think the story is true. Its the same people who think the United States is covering up UFO landings. They don't realize that most myths are based on a little bit of fact. Of course some people would prefer to read a fictional story and think they've uncovered truth than to study real history. Lazy minds. But all in all the book is fun.
B005N95JA4|1.0|(REVISED 11/12) Boy, I do not like what I am reading in these reviews of these new re-masters.

The history of the Stones need some real help....Keith, Keith what you doin' (whistle whistle)...LATER ADDITION: ...well, I have now heard samples of this thru ear-buds. If it sounds bad thru ear-buds, you can bet it sounds horrendous on a real stereo system. The sound is not only gunned-up into the red, it not only takes the mid and low-mid with it, but it actually takes the high-mid frequencies even higher into the stratosphere. It's totally distorted. Only someone who cannot use an equalizer could do such a lousy job...and the rumors I keep hearing (I have yet to see much of this myself) that Bill and Mick Ts picture have been removed...can you imagine if Brain Jones' pictures were taken off the early Stones LPs?  I think it is time to DEMAND that Mick and Keith put their photos back on the jackets. The fans sued Ozzy over the new bass and drum parts, and he has now restored them...
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I put myself through school working in a Mac Lab slightly after Steve Jobs was ousted from Apple.  I'm not a fanboy; in fact I haven't used a Mac every day for over 10 years.  But this book was truly inspirational, and an education for any entrepreneur that's at the intersection of, as Steve said, technology and humanity.    This book contains plenty of events and stories that will be familiar to anyone who's been in tech for the last 20 years;  surprisingly, the book contained plenty of things that I'd certainly never heard about ever before.  More interestingly, there were many new (to me) details about those events, quotes, stories, etc. that put those things in a totally different perspective, and re-shaped my ideas and opinions accordingly.    A must read, plain and simple.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This would get 5 stars, but it loads pretty slow, otherwise it is great app. i like how it links to google docs and dropbox.
0307593312|4.0|Let me start by saying that this was a positively addicting book. I definitely had trouble putting it down and I found it not only thrilling, but beautifully written. A little dark and dreary at times, but beautifully written nonetheless.   Complaints-wise: I have few, but they're still there. I'm not a conservative person by any means, but I did find some of the sexual motifs to be a bit overused at times. Of course, it does add to the gripping shock value of certain parts, but then there are just the place weird/pointless uses of it. The ending was also unsatisfactory for me, but I'd hate to spoil an ending, so I'll leave it there.  Overall, an extremely entertaining book despite its length, and a great choice for anyone interested in Japanese postmodernism, dystopian lore, and/or (moderately) mindbending psychological thrillers.
B005HETBSG|4.0|Despite his stuffy aloofness, Picard shows he can hang with Kirk any day in resolving tense political crisis by laying a charm smackdown on an unsuspecting cave girl.  Awesome throwback to the original series fun though perfectly mixed with high minded TNG themes of Prime Directive and yada yada.  Not in *my* top 10 but definitely a fun and solid TNG episode.
B004J09ONG|5.0|My 7 year old daughter and I absolutely loved the movie. Never mind the 1960's stiff acting and fairly poor picture quality by todays standards. This movie will steal your heart! The loving relationship between husband and wife, the wonderful shots of nature and the tight bond between a wild animal and his human mother...it's simply a heartwarming movie! Note: There are a few \\"intense moments\\". The movie starts with a lion eating a human (we only see bloody river and floating clothing, but still, it might scare little ones who actually \\"get it\\". There are scenes of lions fighting, and Elsa does get hurt by other lions a few times. But if you can narrate it as you watch it, the kids should be fine. I wouldn't let anyone under 5 watch it however.   *** spoiler alert****  I was afraid that Elsa would become wild and forget her human parents (which would have broken my daughter's heart), but that doesn't happen. Although Elsa learned to live free in the wild, and had her own lion family, she remained loving towards her human parents and they made it clear that they saw her many more times. We were thrilled with this ending. My daughter said she'd give it hundred stars if she could.

B006GKHE6G|5.0|15 years ago, you could have paid $70 for a game like this on the Nintendo 64. They made a sequel 10 years ago on the Gamecube for $50. Last year, Vector Unit (this developer) did a neat sequel to Hydro Thunder for the xbox 360, which cost $15. So it's fitting that we have a $3 homage that downloaded to Android in about 30 seconds. The game is flashy and fun on the Kindle Fire, running at full speed with impressive water physics and controls. Did anyone expect the Kindle Fire to have smoother graphical performance when running 3d games than displaying and scrolling text and websites? Another pleasant surprise!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This may not be the most boring gaming application I have ever used...but it is certainly in the top 5.
1250004217|1.0|I was very surprised at how many people liked this book. The historical aspect was interesting as a backdrop, but the storyline was so contrived, it stretched credulity. I also found the flow of the story to be compromised by the poor writing. I got almost to the very end, realized I couldn't care less about the outcome, and deleted it from my library.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this for my main residence and a vacation home in the mountains, it's so easy to switch the program between different locations. What a great planning tool, Definitely a go-to app for the Kindle.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I don't mind ads when it's free that's understandable, but when it's a paid app the pop up ads should be gone...app is great except for ads
B004T32SOK|4.0|This is a reasonably simply way to share files between your Windows Computers, your HP Touchpad, your Android Phone, your Android Tablet, your friend's...<br /><br />Just do not expect much in the way of quick access to your files.
B004VMVTNU|2.0|Well at first i loved all the different function from this app. But once i installed it the setting on my ring tones and volumes would change.... so i deleted and the problem went away. So hopefully this is not a problem for you. Maybe it is a Droid 1 thing. The app was great but the side effect was my main concern and problem that really made me drop my rating!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I like this a lot more than Angry Birds for the simple reason that my kids are trying to free the birds rather than kill the pig.  Plus the graphics are so much better.  My kids are oddly addicted to it however, so we limit it to key situations (like, please do not goto sleep, we are almost home).
B004G6009K|5.0|Recently got a new vizio 65 inch tv(XVT3D650SV). And first 2 things i tried is Tangled and the ultimate wave tahiti. I think 3d content is amazing in both. Me and my 9 yr old daughter enjoyed 3d to our hearts content.  Must have 3d blu ray for all 3d fans.

B004YXE438|4.0|My wife isn't much of a \\"gamer\\", but she loves puzzles. She loves this app, and so do I. Very challenging images, and varying difficulties make this playable on almost any screen size.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Best Klondike game available. Easy to use ( just tap the card you want yo move) . Card face graphics could be improved.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I have played this game on multiple platforms. I am a little disappointed at the lack of additional features (like those present on the Nintendo DS cartridge version), but solid game play is still there. Two minor annoyances though. First, the first name, by alphabet, is the default that comes up... not the last user who played. Second, on my EeePad Transformer the level ending graphics where you collect your new seed packets is very sluggish. All-in-all though, a great game that I highly recommend.
B004EPZ0BQ|4.0|digital copy from UV is crap.  I'd pay extra just to have a digital copy where UV is not involved.  But, the movie is great.  Mila is fantastic and Justin is...who cares, Mila is great!  Great couples movie!
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|This app works ok on my phone, but was incredibly fun on my EeePad Transformer. Multi-touch displays allow for two player games. My wife really liked this too, possibly because she beat me 2 games out of 3.
0374532990|5.0|Since the High Line opened I've wanted to know more about its history, design and how it came to be.  This answers all my questions and a lot more. Great photos and pull out map of the area.  This will be my go to xmas gift this year.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|This is one of Clint's best movies by far. He brings back the \\"walk softly and carry a big stick\\" mentality that our country once had. His character reminds me of my dad who happens to be a vietnam veteran, still smoking and cussing lol.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|So I've used this app on my Epic and it works fine... but if you're looking for a Calendar App for your Kindle Fire I recommend Calengoo as it's the only one that supports direct sync with Google Calendar. Wondering why Amazon approved this for the Kindle Fire when it can't sync unless you have rooted and installed the Google apps and database.
0439023491|5.0|This book does not disappoint. It was just as good as the first one and maybe even a little better. I love this series. I couldn't put it down. Read it in two days.

0307477479|5.0|It's so rare that I read a book and upon finishing it, immediately want to flip back and start it all over. I devoured this book over the course of two regional flights and I can't recommend it enough. It feels much bigger than it actually is (~250 pages) and she manages to crack you up and take your breath away, sometimes in the same sentence. A smart, original, well-researched and affecting book. If you liked The Keep, as I did, this is actually several steps above. Well-deserving of the Pulitzer and everyone I've lent it to loves it as much as I did (which is rare). I wish I had written it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using this app for several months and think it's the best one out there.<br /><br />I find texting and emailing to be so much faster and easier.... And recommend this app to my friends all the time.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|I don't know why I listened to the critics and did not see this in the theater. The movie was not as deep as Iron Man 1 but still quite good. Ryan played a very young Hal and he did it well. My only complaint id that I just couldn't believe he had been in the air force. Blake played an okay Carol. She wasn't given much to work with though. And that is my primary complaint with the movie. The support characters, including the other lanterns were completely forgettable. I never even remember hearing the name of Gal's best friend. At least in Thor/Iron Man the support characters were brought to life and made interesting. If there is a sequel they need to make us care about Sinestro's fall. Maybe draw that out and focus on how Carol becoming a Star Sapphire affects the relationship with Hal. Anyway better than what I heard via word of mouth. 3.5/5 stars.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This game got be back into gaming after a long hiatus. Good for a wide variety of ages. My favorite thing about it is (a) the board changes every game and (b) there are multiple strategies which could win the game. So, 5 stars for game play.  But the materials are a bit on the flimsy side. Thicker cardboard for the pieces or wood would have been preferable. Hence, my overall 5 star rating.  Also, if you're going to get Settlers get Seafarers, too. It actually makes things even more interesting as even more strategies can contribute to winning and there are a wide variety of interesting scenarios to play.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|The writing on this album is fantastic. Very well done. Each song tells a heartfelt story of loss, hope, retreat, or hurt. Tough to listen to at times, but well worth it.
0446582778|5.0|I'm slowly reading the Bosch books in order, and Angels Flight (#6) was the best yet. After the disappointment of Trunk Music, this was a joyous read for all its noir-ishness. Another reviewer called Bosch robotic, and so he might seem to readers who don't know his back story from previous books. But if you already knew Bosch, this book adds more layers as it strips others off this complex, brilliant, flawed man.  Pros: exhilarating twists and turns, Connelly's remarkable ability to create a chaos of complexity then tie off all loose ends, a satisfying non-just kind of justice by the end, Rider's evolution as a character (she was cardboard in Trunk Music), Harry's dark world and the ugly machinations of his city, and as always, Connolly's tight prose and eye for telling details of place and character (which sets him off from tale tellers like Lee Child and James Patterson, whose compelling reads can't rise above their cringe-inducing sentences).  Cons: Irving changes from book to book. Here he's back to who he was in the first books, a hard ass determined to protect the department no matter what; I prefer him like this over the warmer character he became in The Last Coyote. And some events or conversations don't ring true, seemingly presented only to advance the story - the truth about Sheehan is too obvious for Harry not to get it, it is too convenient that Garwood knows about evidence log out, etc.  But on balance, a terrific book. I came to this fresh from reading Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, many critics' choice for greatest novel ever, and honestly didn't feel like I had stepped down the literary ladder. I would not be able to say that if I had picked up any other mystery writer I know of.
1451627289|4.0|This is great audio read but King is no Texan and no football fan.   1. I was born in Dallas in the 40s. I lived there until the 70s. I was in Dallas on 11/22/63. I have never seen anyone in Dallas actually wear a side arm except police..Ever..Visitors look for this. I never saw it.   2. George makes the comment that he knows the Dallas  Texans (soon to be called the Cowboys ) will beat  Houston in a football game. No! The Cowboys were never the Texans. The Texans were only the Texans. They were in competition with the Cowboys. The Cowboys won. The Texans left Dallas and became the Kansas City Chiefs. King definitely does not follow NFL history. Major error.   3. George refers to the NFC in football. There was no NFC in 1963. The leagues did not merge until 1967. King does not follow football. His editor should have caught this one but probably does not follow football either.  4. The town of Terrell, Texas is not pronounced corectly in the audio. Native Texans pick up on this, especially those from Dallas. Audio editor missed the wrong sound.   Native Texans will have difficulty with how a liberal from Maine describes their state, but this is still a great read. Well done.  I drove to Dealey Plaza as a 16 year old kid to see the sight three days after the event. I still remember the amazing amount of flowers. You will enjoy this audio.....Except for that Cowboy error.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just what I wanted. A clean (not crowded with different versions of solitaire), neat and visually pleasing solitaire app. Plus, you can change the background and customize the photo on the cards.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|This is a great conclusion to the series.  It's far darker and action oriented than the show, and there's less hokey/charming character development and interaction, but it does an amazing job wrapping up the loose ends of the series.

0446571415|2.0|The well executed surprise plot twist delights reader and film goer alike.  So if one plot twist delights, then ten plot twists must delight tenfold, and a hundred a hundredfold.  That seems to be the thinking behind \\"Hell's Corner,\\" the latest chapter in David Baldacci's otherwise engaging \\"Camel Club\\" series featuring former government secret agent-assassin John Carr, a.k.a. Oliver Stone.  The flimsiest of plots involving a Mexican drug cartel, Russian organized crime, bombs, and guns cobbles together a series of increasingly unlikely 180-degree turns.  Even Stone begins to suspect that when \\"they\\" want you to go left, you go right.  Except when he realizes it it usually turns out to be wrong.  Doh!  Another 180!  That's a 360!<br /><br />Okay, since I've already kicked the poor writer let me pile on.  The utterly cynical characterization of the U.S. government in which the lack of information sharing between agencies is its least malodorous quality is improbable to all but the most conspiracy minded among us.  What's more is that the revealed antagonist appears to have no real motive, not the even one billion dollars earned for treachery.  Maybe Baldacci should have offered the antagonist Dr. Evil's 100 billion dollars.  Now there's a motive.  In the end, the antagonist claims a Robert Hanssen-style motive: I did it for the challenge.  Except, when one stops to think of it, only Oliver Stone presented much of a challenge, and his involvement postdates the inception of the plot.  So, what was that motive again?<br /><br />It's too bad.  The \\"Camel Club\\" series is welcomed by many suspense novel readers for Baldacci's artfully crafted stories, entertaining surprises, and, most of all, the well drawn quirky relationships between Camel Club members.  \\"Hell's Corner\\" really has little to do with the Camel Club; the principal relationship here is between Stone and a new partner from MI-6, Mary Chapman.  (Or, as I like to call her, Mary Chapman, Mary Chapman.)  She touts herself as Watson to his Holmes.  It's a relationship that seems promising at first, but is ultimately suffocated by the many plot twists.<br /><br />\\"Hell's Corner\\" has an extraordinary number of minor characters.  Even the talented Ron McLarty falters under the strain.  To assist with women's parts (one of McLarty's few weaknesses as a reader), Hachette Audio brought in the actor Orlagh Cassidy, who does a remarkable job handling British and American accents.  I haven't listened to many books with multiple readers--albeit an apparently growing trend in audio books--and it took me a while to get used to it.  As in previous recordings of Camel Club books, the producers incorporate some sound effects (principally sounds of bombs and gunfire); these are sparingly used.  Dramatic music is, happily, also kept to a minimum.  At the end of the reading of the book, in the version I have access to, there are interviews with McLarty, and between McLarty and Baldacci.  These aren't very illuminating and add little value to the recordings.<br /><br />All in all, I wish I could report that \\"Hell's Corner\\" is another fun, rollicking ride.  I would recommend waiting for the next appearance of the Camel Club, which cannot but be a more enjoyable read.on to his Holmes.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|The Verso artist series \\"Cities\\" cover is an excellent product.  It is exactly as described, fits the Kindle Fire very well, and seems sturdy enough to protect the Kindle in daily use.  If you're using your Kindle in extreme situations, you will need something sturdier, but for my level of use, carried in a briefcase or purse, this is perfect.  The complaints about it not closing completely will be addressed by a few days' breaking-in period.  The elastic straps, with a silicone lining, grip the Kindle, holding it firmly in place, and don't interfere with the use of the features that are accessed by touching the edge of the screen.  Some cases which frame the device, while very secure, make it more difficult to wake up the virtual features such as turning wi-fi on and off.  The case extends beyond the dimensions of the device, and this provides extra protection, as well as reducing  accidental presses of the on-off button at the bottom of the Kindle.  Overall, a really nice case for everyday use.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|This concert DVD is one of the best.  Stevie Wonder rarely tours and to see the footage of him live in concert is a must-see.  My favorite tracks are Superstition, Isn't she lovely and As.  The whole band rocks out in this concert and you will too!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nothing like a classic game of Solitaire to make a lonely time come alive: Please Kindle, get ALL the Apple Apps! Otherwise I'm definitely going to trade this fire for an &quot;App&quot;delicious I-Pad! Sorry, but nothing beats the Apple Apps, and until you get this, you will never hope to ever keep up with I-Pad/Pod Sales. Being cheap in the end will only lower your stocks, and quarterly earnings! Don't you see? We love GREAT Apps!!! Really! Really.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Chapter by chapter, I was fascinated by the observations and patterns in this book.  I couldn't get through it fast enough.  If you want to challenge the way you think, this is more than a worthy read.  It takes our notions of success and turns them upside down on its' head.  I won't say more...it will ruin your read.  As for this edition in Kindle form, it is well done if you know how to navigate your Kindle.  At times you lose the charts and family trees but I didn't find it a problem because he explains it all so well.

B0068TJLSY|5.0|Super 8 is about kids.  Their problems, their ingenuity, bravery, friendships, and foibles.  Spielberg didn't invent this genre, Robert Louis Stevenson did.  Such stories give kids their due for their smarts and integrity.  Abrams is growing as a director.  This and Start Trek are two of the best science fiction films made this century.  In a film world where *men* dressed like ten year-olds are passed off as good science fiction, I'll take a movie where the kids have heart and make the tough decisions.  There's no comparison really.  Super 8 is solid story telling, the real deal.
886293713X|5.0|I've carried a red hardcover 12 month moleskine diary for at least 10 years and it's the only object in my life that hasn't been lost, stolen, broken, or defective at some point. Although I need to buy one each year simply for the calendar, the cover, pocket, ribbon and elastic band are always still in great shape. I've never even had a page come loose. One feature that I adore about the moleskine is the removeable calendar that slips into the pocket. It saves me so much time and I hate rewriting all those names and addresses over each year. I have a smartphone and I use it regularly. I love the voice functionality, the apps, the convenience, etc., but still, the moleskine holds not only my diary, but my lists, my thoughts, those quirky ideas I get, cool email addresses I want to checkout. I look back at the past year's moleskine and it's not just a calendar -[[ASIN:886293713X Moleskine 2012 12 Month Weekly Notebook Red Hard Cover Pocket (Moleskine Legendary Notebooks (Calendars))]] I can see a journal, as well. So, I'm buying another red moleskine this year and I'll carry it everywhere with my smartphone at my hip. But if I really have to choose, I guess the moleskine will always have my heart. By the way, all of my past copies stand on my shelf in lieu of actual journals as they serve the purpose so well.

See [...] That said, it worked exactly as advertised when I opened the network, so I'm not knocking it more than one star.    I realize the limitation is almost definitely in the receiver, and it's entirely possible a future firmware update will change things.  I'm using a TX-NR609 receiver with current firmware as of 12/2/2011.

Punctuation without having to switch keyboard panels, a real 10 key panel when needed, adjustable longpress delay, adjustable height so no more weird stretched portrait kb, light, dark, and neon themes to name a few awesome features. Word prediction is also incredible. Almost like it can read my mind. Make sure you get this X version and not the standard or you will miss out on so many great features.  Worth every penny.

I would srongly recommend finding an alternative.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|LOVE the series! Believe it or not, I hadn't even heard of it until recently, but was able to correct this glaring omission in my personal library thanks to Amazon's Streaming Video Section!<br /><br />I guess not having heard of it is a doubly bad admission considering I own several large Preparedness Websites... go figure. But since I'm up-to-date now, and Rick's group is obviously struggling through aCOMS (\\"a Collapse Of Modern Society\\"), where every noise draws unwanted attention, might I recommend that SOMEONE in their group think about maybe hanging a SILENCER off the end of their weapons? Maybe even spending some time with a Kinetic Bullet-Puller and some Powder Scales to work up some Sub-Sonic rounds for the pistols? They'd only have to dial back the velocity of the 9mm Rounds (or even the 357 in Rick's Colt Python) just a touch to be rid of that loud Super-Sonic, Zombie-Attention-Getting, 'CRAAACK'.<br /><br />Heck, for that matter, if Daryl can punch a crossbow bolt through a Zombie Skull by hand, maybe all *we* need is a few 22's with \\"CBee's\\"... then we could even carry PLENTY of Zombie-Slaying Ammo without sacrificing the amount of WATER and FOOD that we'll need to get ourselves up to our Pre-Prepared Retreats! OF COURSE *WE* have a small Vacation-Home/Retreat already stocked and waiting up in the Mountains of Georgia/SC/NC/TENN, Right? Because we see how well the people with the \\"Bug-Out-Bag-and-Live-in-a-Tent\\" plan have been faring so far (IE: Not very well), especially compared to \\"life on the farm\\"... Seriously, leaving home with all of your worldly goods on your back is called \\"being a refugee\\", which has a LONG and consistent history World-Wide of 'not working very well'... So that Bug-Out-Bag just needs to hold enough stuff to get you up to your Pre-Stocked Zombie-Proof Mountain Retreat... say, \\"3 days worth of supplies\\" ;)<br /><br />OK, ok... maybe I'm just getting all technical and Engineery (Occupational Hazard), but if Rick's group will just make a few silencers, at least then they won't be ringing the dinner bell every time they have to tap the trigger on a Walker...  I'm just sayin...east then they won't be ringing the dinner bell every time they have to tap the trigger on a Walker...  I'm just sayin...
0786838655|5.0|The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan is the first volume in the five-part Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. I read these books after all of them were out,so I didn't have any irregular anticipation between picking up each book (and neither will you). When you start this book, be warned: you are starting a long adventure, one that won't let you go and you won't let it go for a long time.<br /><br />This novel begins with the character of Percy Jackson, a modern day Perseus. He discovers he is a demi-god (son of Poseidon) and after a lot of mysterious events ensue, he is sent on a quest. (duh-duh-duh!!!!)<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but let's say there are many twists and turns that will keep you guessing and reading.<br /><br />If you do some research on this book series, you will find out that Rick Riordan began this tale as a bedtime story for his children, and it definately possesses that story-time quality. Riordan's simple prose has a way of sucking in the oldest reader, while still enrapturing the hearts and minds of younger children. This is a great series to read at any age, sort of like Harry Potter.<br /><br />Speaking of Harry Potter, there are bound to be comparisons. Both are coming of age stories about a Boy, his smart female friend, their quirky mutual doofus friend (a love-able doofus). There is Camp Half-Blood (PRINCE) and a few Dumbledore-ish characters. But don't fret! You will only think of it like this for the first 200 or so paces. Very rapidly, Riordan descends the reader into his own world, where characters aren't initially what they seem and there's always something in plain sight that the reader cannot see.<br /><br />The use of mythology throughout this series is great. I actually read this book on the reccomendation from my little brother (He was 13 at the time, I was 16, am now 17). He is a HUGE mythology fan and this doesn't step on any toes by trying to re-write history or anything. The stuff you find out is mostly factual of what the ancient Greeks believed. And Riordan does an excellent job blending the antiquities of old with modern problems of divorce, dyslexia, and kidnapping.<br /><br />As a whole, this novel isn't just a great first entry in a series, it is an awesome stand-alone novel, too. Pick it up. Immediately You will not regret it.<br /><br />READ THIS IF YOU LIKE:<br />-Greek Mythology<br />-Harry Potter<br />-His Dark Materials<br />- Inheritance ( I guess...

B000WQWPJQ|5.0|I am not a big Tom Hanks fan nor one of outdoor type adventure movies but have to say that cast away is quite a great film.  When I first saw it I could not remember the last time a movie had me glued to the tv so strong that I could not wait to see what was going to happen next.  It does remind me a little of \\"The Edge\\", with anthony hopkins but more interesting.  A film that should keep your attention well from the start to end and then some.  It's not a sci-fiction, war or animated type picture but a tense drama that keeps you in suspense.  For sure a Tom Hanks classic.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app, its highly accurate and has a great easy to use interface! definitely. recommend! great for everyone!
B004A8ZX2I|4.0|I really liked this movie and although others have spoiled the plot, I wont.  It kept us guessing all the way through until the key moment that is revealed.  Good action, mild language and hardly any sexual content once again proves Hollywood doesn't have to inundate your brain with sex and profanity to put out a decent movie in this genre.
B005G6QF8Y|3.0|No, Perfectionist isn't Perfect. But it's a very well thought-out, balanced first album with a few excellent hits. There are a few tracks that, the first time around, I had to think, \\"This song could be improved...\\" but I still somehow loved the songs. All of them. From the edgy dance hits to the more emotional tracks like, 'If I were God\\" this album kicks some butt.
B002LHZV5E|4.0|Click is a fun movie to watch. I love the message it is sending to all husband and wife's out there. Even just single hard working people. There will never be enough money in the world that can replace your family and loved ones.

B000MV8AE0|2.0|Ok, so why fictionalize an account of Beethoven's last days when the facts are well known? In a word: pandering. From Hollywood's standpoint, the audience for a period drama is mostly female, so in order for the film to have a chance at success, it needs a strong female character at the center. Thus, the two male copyists whom worked with Beethoven on the Ninth Symphony are replaced with the fictional, headstrong proto-feminist Anna, who of course faces sexist opposition from the mostly cardboard male characters around her. It's a tired old motif that has been employed many times before, but what's particularly egregious in this case is that it's essentially made-up 'history'. There's no statement anywhere on the film that I could see which indicated that certain facts or characters had been deliberately fabricated, and since few people will take the time to verify the accuracy of the story, what we end up with is a piece of revisionist history, eagerly swallowed by hopeful females who would like to think that Beethoven had a secret 'ghostwriter' of sorts in Anna.  Think I'm paranoid? Well I was coerced into watching this film just last night by my wife and mother-in-law - I agreed, even though I already knew it was fake. The two immediately were drawn into the story (one saving grace is that the acting is good) and soon were remaking on the proceedings as if they were being presented with a factual account. I gently reminded them to or three times that the Beethoven/Anna relationship was a complete fabrication, but it did not matter, they were becoming believers! My wife shot back, \\"It *could* have happened!\\" Yeah, and Hitler could have secretly been Jewish!  There's been several of these revisionist-history type films lately, and not all with a feminist agenda either. \\"The Inglorious Bastards\\" and \\"Anonymous\\" are two recent ones. I'm really sorry that the facts of history don't align with people's particular political agendas, but this crap has got to stop - the facts are the facts, people. Get over it!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Very addictive and creative game. Keeps me laughing at every level. Great Music and graphics. Wish there was a way to backup game.
B000MV8XPG|4.0|I like the product . It appears to be well-made .The directions were just ok ! It didn't take long to assemble . The \\"smoke Stack\\" muffler on seat is easily knocked off .
B00466HN86|5.0|I hadn't been to a theater in years, and the local theater wasn't showing this movie, but friends in other parts of the country were recommending it, and I liked Fireproof, and I liked the trailer - so I drove about an hour away to see Courageous on the big screen. It was worth the drive. It's a nice mix of humor and suspense, seriousness and inspiration. Since it had such a long run, I went back to see it a second time, this time picking up little touches, and appreciating some nuances, that I'd missed the first round. I'm looking forward to buying it for gifts, and also getting a DVD for myself, so I can watch it again.  I'm not sure it's fair to compare it to Fireproof, since they're quite different movies, but for what it's worth I think this one is better. Fireproof I might hesitate to give as a gift to some people, for fear they might think I was trying to send them a message in a roundabout way, or because I don't think they'd like it. This one, I can think of all sorts of people I think will like it: young, old, men, and women.
B005XOPEOU|3.0|It goes to reason that when a band has immeasurable success resting on their laurels it will take something insipid or retrod to make the average music aficionados ear's curl a little bit, in Coldplay's case, for the better.  Fortunately enough for them and their creative process, they have proven time and time again that a few tweaks, like the next years flu shot, will be good enough to keep people coming in rampant droves.  This was absolutely set in stone for me when I lazily downloaded Mylo Xyloto for two bucks on Amazon, started the album up, and was welcomed with a sound that was distinctively Coldplay, a definite difference from Viva La Vida, and lyrically handicapped.  Keep in mind, that was just the second track, Hurts Like Heaven, where the chorus blabbers \\"you use your heart like a weapon, and it hurts like heaven\\", followed by some guitar schmaltz that Coldplay has coined over the years.  The next tracks were significantly less insipid and more redeeming, Paradise has a distinctly different sound, I don't know how much I care for that upper octave synth layer, but the songs affable pulse and those chamber choir background vocals are awesome (I love chamber choir background vocals, queue M83) Paradise alone helped make the rest of the album much more enjoyable.  Other highlights included Every Teardrop is a Waterfall, there are some fun ideas of life and music thrown in there, and a good electro pulse intro is nothing but pure joy for me.  Princess of China is whatever, its one of those meetings of the minds that turns out decently, but is nothing that keeps me terribly interested, other artists do what is attempted in that track much better.  In the end, I struggle to not draw comparisons with the other greatest albums of the year, the little fillers, the chamber choir vocals, the features, guitar, all of it, it is done well, and it is done very Coldplay, but it still bores me for the most part, Brian Eno continues to get up into those high registers, Coldplay still settles into a steady rhythm, sometimes its catchy and hot in Paradise and Every Teardrop is a Waterfall, and most of the time its a yawner.  But hey, you can be darn sure people will call it an awesome album, I won't argue with them because that is their opinion and it is backed with some solid music and production values.  But, for me, I will continue to pick out those few tracks that are something worth listening to, and the rest probably won't be visited terribly often.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I am a huge fan of Les Miserables. I have seen at least 3 productions and own the Original Broadway Cast Recording CDs. It is my all time favorite musical. That said I feel that this DVD is a great way to experience the music of Les Mis at home. You get to see the faces and emotion of the singers in a way that you cannot in a theater. The singing is augmented by a fantastic full orchestra and a huge choir. This you definitely will not get in the theater. Also, at the end there is an encore of sorts with performers from the original casts, and a troupe of young people who put on a production of Les Mis in London (as the future of Les Mis). I highly recommend it!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I watched this one cold winter afternoon with the fire crackling in the fireplace and was transported back to Victorian England.  My 26-year-old son walked through the room and stayed to watch the entire film.  When it was over, I wanted to watch it again just to soak up the architecture, furnishings and costumes.  Emily Blunt was divine as young Victoria and Rupert Friend seemed like a real Prince.  The movie left you wanting to know more about these remarkable people and their time period.  That's a good thing.  As a history major, love it when a film makes a period come alive.  Highly recommend this sumptuous film.
B000FC1AGG|1.0|I felt absolutely horrible after purchasing this book. Normally, I'd try the free sample offered for a book, but this time I just purchased the book before really trying it out and o'boy did I pay for it (literally). The first chapter was so annoying. I tried and tried to focus, but found my mind wondering off to la la land. I couldn't concentrate on the book at all. I tried to read the 2nd chapter and just gave up. I couldn't even finish the book. The protagonist just rambled on and on about nothing. I didn't see where the story was going. Geez!!! If you have money and time to waste, buy this book.
031603441X|5.0|Keith Richards is one incredible musician.  Not only did he end up playing  music with his childhood idols, he invented new ways of playing the guitar.  The book really gives you a glimpse into the most successful rock band ever.  I have a whole new respect for Keith.  The book is really well written and fascinating.  He even includes recipe for bangers and mash.  Oh, so terribly British.  Hats off to you, Keith!
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|there is something heavy dark mysterious about this release and strange match-up.  I did not like the intro song at first...it sounded like a really bad Lou Reed artsy crap from the 70's and it overall the album still does...for those Metallica fans out there.  However, I do agree with other reviewers that liked it..that it is actually could be viewed as a masterpiece.  Something gripping about it-and maybe that is Lou Reed-because I was a Metallica fan before I was ever into Lou Reed.  In many ways it is a weird mixture of 70's and 90's metal and maybe that is the era-genre confusing thing about it.  It is (no matter how you put it) a very weird, interesting mixture of artsy metal?  However, that is exactly what makes if brilliant or incredibly bad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This trilogy was amazing! i couldn't put it down. for two weeks, i was addicted to it. I strongly recommend reading it. buy it and enjoy it. I wish they would make it as a movie,i think it would be a hit.
B005HSG3U6|1.0|I ordered this cover because it was lightweight, it came in pink, and it had what looked like a perfect stand function.  I should have checked the reviews a little more closely!  Loved the color, loved the softness of the inside, it seemed to hold the Fire securely, but as soon as I tried to use the stand (with the Fire inserted), it simply plopped down.  Not a good thing for the Fire on a regular basis I am sure.  I tried to get the edge to stay in the groove for the stand, but it simply would not.  Mine is packaged for return - I am willing to give up some lightness to get a good stand.
0525457585|4.0|I don't think I will ever get tired of this book.  I had forgotten that it had the two different colors of text.  Way better than the movies...  The cover is not my favorite, I wish they had one with an Auron on the front.
030746363X|5.0|I bought this book for weight loss. It is quite complicated in parts, but as it says you can just pick and choose relevant chapters according to your interest. For me, the chapters on weight loss, especially the kettle bell chapter was the best and I love my kettle bell now.   I even recommended it to my personal trainer and he likes the book too. Some other personal trainers in the gym knew about it and said they really like it too. With a lot of determination, and organisation I think anyone could achieve the amazing things in this book. It is kind of like a recipe/ how to book, eg. if u do this x times a week, for y weeks you will be this.   Some critics of the book say the author is very good at self promoting but as the author explains at the beginning, he could have published his findings through the academic route but it probably would not have been made public so quickly. So I am happy that the author has decided to share his research in this way, even though it has not gone through the strict testing required in laboratories or peer review, because all the people who bought the book create that kind of testing mechanism anyways. He is honest in saying that approaches he has come across in his life have worked for him and thinks it will work on anyone else, and he gives some anecdotal stories on how he came about them to provide a background for the science and training technique.  So, although some people are skeptical about the author's seemingly endless and unique knowledge about such various areas of health, if you are skeptical, you should read the book and borrow what works for you because there is a lot of very useful, really cool stuff.   Good Xmas present book, especially for boys (of all ages) who are impossible to shop for.   xx
B0058ZZDVS|5.0|Shockingly good with great characters you actually care about, watch this show from start to finish. It's got class, spunk and style. It's my favorite new show of the year.
B0002DKCMG|4.0|It is a funny movie and a classic at the height of American Pie, Road Trip and Old School.   Just to give you an idea if I had to compare all the previously mentioned movies and Euro Trip i would put them like this:  1) American Pie  2) Old School   [Not really sure if I like old school or american pie better thou :/]  3) Road Trip  4) Euro Trip  [I'm again at a pickle between Road and Euro Trip :/]  Some female nudity (topless only) and some male nudity (front and back), so homophobics, be warned :)
B002SAUCBC|5.0|This is my favorite Stephen King book, but I think it's because I imagined contests like this one when I was a kid. I've read it several times.
B000HOMU98|5.0|I agree with all former Marines who state this is the ultimate movie.  No one achieves realism on screen better than Kubrick, I've come to admire his work more as I get older.  I served in the Corps between 1981 to 1985 just after Reagan swept out the Carter blazay post NAM drug mentality and rejuvinated our Armed Forces.  The intensity of Marine Basic cannot be understood unless you've been there.  I used to doubt the tales of former Vietnam vets having flashbacks watching 'Platoon' until I saw FMJ.  Kubrick and R Lee Ermey made me a believer.  25 years after, I literally felt the sensations and awe I had as an 18 year fresh off the farm, hitting the yellow footprints, getting a new one ripped, torn down and built up.  I think a testament to this film can be made in that, as a father of 2 sons who became combat Marines, that I let them watch this with me at a younger and impressionable age; without sugar coating or lying about the challenge; without glorifying war and teaching love and respect for their fellow man; yet they still chose this path.  God Bless America, and the Corps.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This novel is less about school shootings than it is a psychological prodding of a person that, for whatever reason, DNA got wrong.  It is relentless, tragic, and tiring -- and, importantly, it is also beautifully written.<br /><br />Shriver is a very talented writer.  Her pacing, although not *always* perfect, is still outstanding; watching the gradual aging of Kevin coincide with the evolution of his hideousness is remarkable and foreboding.  The ending of the novel is amazing: to say anything more would be a disservice.<br /><br />A few minor quibbles: First, it is a bit off-putting (especially at the beginning) to realize that the narrative is told through letters, yet the writer has the wit and word-choice of an advanced novelist.  Additionally, Kevin's characterization occasionally comes across as one-dimensional and unrealistically evil.  These are, however, occasional qualms that do not in any way minimize the overall impact that this story has.<br /><br />A note as to the Kindle formatting of this novel: I was very impressed.  The chapters are well-marked, there is a convenient page-tracker that tells you how far along in the book you would be if you were reading a hard copy, and there were few, if any, technical problems with the formatting.
0307593312|5.0|I spent a considerable amount of time reading reviews and debating whether or not I should purchase it. Finally, I came across a reviewer who basically said, stop analyzing it, buy it, and just read it. which I did. and I'm very glad that I did. Unlike anything I had ever read before. I was memerized by the writing and the story. So for those of you still debating, stop it, buy it and read it. You'll be glad you did.
1451627289|5.0|This is one of the best Stephen King books I've ever read. It's 849 pages and doesn't drag at all; it was fascinating and vivid with a nice little twist at the end. I stayed up until 2:30 this morning to finish it because I couldn't put it down!
B005V20JKI|5.0|love this game! very addicting game, play it all the time. I have no force close issues, but it does freeze sometimes
B0052ZQMLO|5.0|I have just downloaded this German-English dictionary as I do a fair bit of reading in German and it is working perfectly on my Kindle 4. I have been able to set it as the default dictionary for German and I have just tried it out on a Kindle German book and it is working with no problems. I am therefore glad that I purchased it as it will certainly be of great value as I continue with my reading in German.
1451627289|4.0|So, first, let me say that if you're looking for a novel that details life in a world where Kennedy was not assassinated, THIS ISN'T IT.  I suppose that, if I hadn't ready any of the reviews of the book and had gone into it wanting it to be something that it's not, I would be as disappointed as some others seem to be.  I read a hand full of reviews, though, and knew what I was getting.  This is more of an exploration of possible effects of time travel, a romp through the 1960s and a man finding love.  I think that we all read novels to escape from reality or to suspend our disbelief and this certainly allowed me to accomplish both.    Having not read anything King has written since around the mid- to late-80's, I had forgotten what a captivating writer he is and just how brilliant of a mind he has.  It is well written and interesting.
0440244870|5.0|This was actually my first chic lit. Before reading this, i was into paranormal romance, which i still am, but now i've expanded my book genre horizon. I totally loved reading Shopaholic and found myself relating... Loved it so much that i ordered the rest in the series! I love how Becky always finds herself in outrageous situations!! I am officially a Sophie Kinsella fan!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I had purchased a leather cover locally and it made the Kindle Fire look like a thick planner. This cover is light, thin, but protects my Kindle Fire and is very slip resistant when in hand. One slight drawback is that the tilt feature doesn't 'lock\\" in place but it still works ok. My wife has an iPad and this cover makes the Kindle Fire look exactly like a mini version of her iPad.
1594744769|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised with this read.  The author did a great job in creating an exciting and fun to read story.  Everyone in the book club enjoyed this book.

0312323867|4.0|I read Something Borrowed and I really liked it, but Something Blue is a lot better! It was a page turner for me, and unputdownable..I liked the story line and the ending better. Since I like two of Emily Giffin's novels so far, I'm hoping i'll like the others as well...if not more..
B005GP7F8Y|1.0|The qualility of this \\"Blu-ray\\" is not acceptable. It is awful. This isn't a review about the movie which is what Amazon wants. Amazon doesn't want a review that says the qualility is unacceptable. Don't buy. \\"Remastered\\" is a misrepresentation and Amazon should return all buyers funds.
B000002KXO|5.0|I must admit I hadn't listened to this album in many, many years. But for whatever reason I put this in my CD player the other day, and I was floored by what I heard. To put this into context, this album was released in 1982, the first new studio release after Fleetwood Mac's somewhat controversial 1979 \\"Tusk\\" album.<br /><br />\\"Mirage\\" (12 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with Christine McVie's excellent \\"Love In Store\\", and we are off. Memorable after memorable track follows: Lindsey Buckingham's urgent \\"Can't Go Back\\", Stevie Nicks' gentle \\"That's Alright\\", Lindsey's irresitable \\"Book of Love\\" (one of my favorite tracks on here--with great drums from Mick Fleetwood), Nicks' \\"Gypsy\\" (a major hit) and the flawless first half of the album ends with McVie's pensive \\"Only Over You\\". But wait! there is more! The second half kicks off with Lindsey's excellent \\"Empire State\\", and great tracks follow one after another (including Lindsey's delicious 50s homage \\"Oh Diane\\") until tracks 11 and 12 (\\"Eyes of the World\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\") which are not as memorable as the first 10 tracks.<br /><br />What an album! It is a clear retreat from the more experimental \\"Tusk\\", focusing on more pop-friendly tunes. If you're a Stevie Nicks fan, you'll note that she only contributed 3 songs on here, but of course she was hugely popular at the time as a solo artist. That saud, now almost 30 years old, this album really sounds like a little \\"best of\\" in its own right, and for me the last essential album in the Fleetwood Mac catalog. As other reviewers have noted, this CD could benefit from a proper \\"remastered\\" edition, and for that matter (but that's just me) an expanded \\"deluxe\\" reissue with B-sides and other assorted rarities and live tracks from that era. But in the end, \\"Mirage\\" has aged quite nicely, so enjoy for what it is.

0439023521|5.0|I never heard of this book, until I saw a trailer for the upcoming movie and was intrigued. WOW! I couldn't put it down. The characters are well thought out, the story is dark yet sweet. A must read if you love a good story.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Does anybody really need another review that says how much fun this app is?  Angry Birds starts easy and builds and becomes addictive.  It's one of the best games ever created for handheld devices.  Easy to learn, fun to play, worth the price.
B002ZG981E|3.0|I bought this on Black Friday 2011. I thought I was getting a bluray disc, DVD, and a digital copy. The digital copy expired on May of 2011. I seriously don't understand how they can get away with this? Why is this OK? Checking the milk in my fridge.<br /><br />12/27/2011 update - It's working now!
B005N1E8A4|5.0|Finally, a Kylie disc with picture and sound to match the caliber of her shows!  This bluray is superb!  As stated in another review, much better than \\"X\\".  The picture is pristine and crystal clear.  The colors are rich and vibrant.  They really shows off the fantastic costumes.  The blacks are deep and inky.  The sound is big, dynamic with good bass kick and the rear channels get good use.  Everything you want from a concert on bluray. Make sure you select the option for the DTS-Master audio as it defaults to PCM Stereo.  They included a Dolby Digital track as well.  Why anyone would want to listen to a compressed version on bluray is curios.  I highly recommend this concert to everyone.  She does not dance as much as she did in her \\"X\\" tour but the production is top notch and the screen shots are excellent.  BUY THIS ON BLURAY!  You won't regret it.  LOVE IT!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|This tunein radio app is great!  It has all my local radio stations and many others nonlocal (a few are blocked by their stations, but most are available), local police and fire radio, and a ton of podcasts (again just a few are unavailable), including Bill Maher, Imus, Mancow, Harry Shearer, and many more.  This is by far the best free app I've found for my kindle fire!
B00631VJIC|5.0|I've been watching this show since season 1, episode 1.  Since that first show, I've been waiting for the soundtrack.  I might've changed up a few of the songs, but overall, I can't wait to get this cd.  Didn't realize that Katy Sagal was such a talented singer and this is a great way to showcase talent that isn't mainstream.

0143038583|5.0|Dr. Pollan, thanks for writing such a great, eye-opening book!  I now go to the grocery store with a different perspective as I traverse the aisles of industrially produced food and HFCS.  I am not sure what my next steps will be, and unlike other readers, I'm not *yet* making any drastic changes to my lifestyle or eating habits.  However, just half-way through the book, I have vowed never to feed myself (or my family) McDonalds again.  McDonalds is evil and one of the things wrong with America and industrially-produced foods.    Bottom line:  the solution appears to be rejuvenating local food production which relies on natural agricultural processes.  There seems to be a resurgence in this movement, and this appears to be the only \\"true\\" organic, healthy foods solution.  (also read Bill McKibben's \\"Deep Economy\\" - there is a whole chapter on the benefits of eating locally).  Another conclusion that I can draw is that America is the founding country of Industrial food production, and \\"our\\" eating habits and food production methods are gaining widespread popularity (and implementation)  in other countries who are *trying* to industrialize - of course, China comes to mind where farms are disappearing left and right.  What's funny is in third world countries like the Philippines, local and \\"organic\\" foods are a necessity for a majority of the population where lots of people grow their own food just to survive.  There ARE no feeds with chemicals and anti-biotics and ALL the chickens and pigs there are \\"free range\\".  What's called \\"organic\\" in America is commonplace in the Philippines.  The meats in the Philippines definitely have a different taste to them too - chicken is more \\"chikeny\\" and pigs are more..well...\\"porky\\"...the meats taste fresh and natural ala \\"Polyface (true organic) Farm\\" that is referenced in this book.  Anyway, great book - it's one of my all-time favorites.  For those of you who haven't read it yet, put down \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Hunger Games\\" and READ and LEARN about what's wrong with the world and possible solutions to fix them.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is a feel good movie with a great message!  The beginning of the movie (the shark attack) may not be appropriate for VERY young audiences, but there is nothing too graphic shown.  (It is simply disturbing)  The rest of the movie tells a beautiful story of family love and perserverance.

Put it in the blu ray player just to check in out abit and guess what?  I didn't get the lights up.  Start listening to this disk and couldn't leave it.  Called a buddy over to listen with me and he was in awe.  Great Sound very good Video and the energy the concert put out was overwhelming. Told my buddy this is going to be my New Years Eve Concert this year.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|These hallows are not only \\"deathly,\\" they're \\"darker than dark.\\"<br /><br />Your enjoyment of this fascinating installment in the Potter series will depend largely on how much you don't mind that the screen becomes darker than dark for many of the night scenes. It's the only flaw in the transfer of the film to DVD. Whether this is the fault of the original theatrical film, I don't know but the lighting technicians didn't account for correct light exposure, that's for sure.<br /><br />Other than that, the performances are all first-rate, especially those of DANIEL RADCLIFFE, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT, this time getting their main share of the spotlight in a story where the supporting players are strictly \\"in support.\\" All three of them prove themselves capable of carrying the film on the strength of their own talent.<br /><br />Even names like MICHAEL GAMBON, BRENDAN GLEESON, ALAN RICKMAN, HELENA BONHAM CARTER and IMELDA STAUNTON have little to do as far as actual screen time is concerned. Carter's most impressive moments are obscured by the dark lighting employed in most of her scenes so that she is scarcely even recognizable.<br /><br />The story involves the quest of the three young Wizards to track down and destroy Voldemort's secret of immortality and destruction by finding the Horcruxes that threaten their survival. On the way, they leave the confines of Hogwarts and have to fend for themselves among all the forces Voldemort has sent to destroy them. We only get a few glimpses of RALPH FIENNES as the terrifying Voldemort, but it's enough to make you want to see the grand finale in Part 2 of this series.<br /><br />Summing up: Many of the \\"dark\\" scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt. Hopefully, the final installment will provide a satisfying conclusion to Harry's odyssey. The special effects are as clever as ever, particularly for the segment involving the seven Harry Potters.

B004LAIU4I|5.0|I picked up this Paul Simon album in advance of going to see him in concert recently.  I really didn't have expectations about the disc either way.  For me personally, his post \\"Saints\\" albums have been okay, but nothing really grabbed me about them or demanded my attention, other than - yeah, sounds like a nice, aging Paul Simon, not bad.  Since my somewhat random purchase, I can't stop listening to So Beautiful or So What.  The music - understated guitars and percussion - is excellent and suits the melodies well.  But most importantly, he brought the songs.  And you can tell he actually is proud of these - his singing and committment to them is refreshing.  There are a few lesser tracks, but generally this is a great album all the way through.  It is a grower -- except for the first track, there really aren't any immediate pop songs as he's written in the past.  So give it some time and you will be rewarded.  My favorites are Dazzling Blue, The Afterlife, Rewrite and So Beautiful or So What.  The concert, by the way, was fantastic.  Paul Simon has still got it.

La descripción de Barcelona, el ambiente, los personajes y la misma historia, te hacen transportarte hasta aquellso años en cuanto abres el libro. La historia de Julian Carax y sus libros te mantiene intrigada todo el tiempo hasta llegar a un desenlace trepidante e inesperado.  Espero que la continuación sea igual de buena.
B0041TM3LA|3.0|[Note: 8 negatives already? I'm not downrating the album based on the quality of the music or the value of this package.  A listener is going to find sheer pleasure in these 8 albums at a price that's practically a \\"steal.\\"  But it's the way the albums are advertised--\\"Classic\\"--that's highly misleading.  Especially with an artist as prolific as Oscar, it can be extremely challenging to pick out the very best albums (when I want to impress friends, I usually start with the duo album, \\"Oscar Peterson and Joe Pass at A Salle la Pleyel\\"--which I wouldn't even regard as a \\"classic\\").  I can easily envision a new Oscar Peterson listener picking up this set and thinking, \\"Eight albums.  That's got to be all I need by him.\\"  Sorry, but such a limited representation of a major artist would be highly unfortunate, especially to younger listeners who don't even rank Oscar among the greats (Brad Mehdau is winning polls in part by employing an accessible, familiar repertory, eg. the Beatles and Radiohead). Selecting Oscar's truly classic sessions remains a task for experienced collectors and trained ears.  See the suggestions in the commentary following the review. Otherwise, imagine someone releasing the \\"8 Classic Jazz Recordings of All time\\" and omitting Miles' \\"Kind of Blue,\\" or Coltrane's \\"Giant Steps,\\" or Bill Evans' \\"Vanguard Sessions,\\" or \\"Getz/Gilberto,\\" or \\"Time Out,\\" or Louis' \\"West End Blues.\\"  Hardly representative of the legacy, the beauty and luminous moments in the history of this indigenous African-American art form ininseparably linked to the \\"Great American Songbook\\" and its composers.  The same criteria apply ti any individual artist.]<br /><br />Any recording by Oscar, especially before the stroke he suffered in the mid-nineties, is five stars.  Apart from his prodigious technique, rivaled only by Art Tatum, is the visceral power of his music, its ability to lift the listener right out of his chair.  He took traditional \\"swing\\" to a new level, one that has not been equaled much less surpassed by any musician since his passing. Louis had it practically all to himself in the '20s and early '30s, then it spread to other musicians from the Count Basie rhythm section of the mid-30s, and finally Oscar represented yet another level--a groove that a few select trios have located, viz. Gene Harris (The Three Sounds) or Monty Alexander or Red Garland amd Wyn Kelly.  Of course, there are many different \\"time feels\\" and ways of swinging (Tatum's and Monk's time was as impeccable as it was different from one another as well as from Oscar.  And Max Roach would take the music out of the traditional groove into more adventurous, open territory, though no less visceral in its impact on the listener.)  So the preceding is a descriptive characterization rather than a value judgment (Bill Evans is as far from an O.P. \\"groove\\" as you can get, but he is, at least to my ears, the most profound and deeply moving pianist, so much so that the traditional groove is no longer an important feature of the music.)  Oscar's time feel was the fullest realization of the 4/4 swing that characterized the so-called Swing Era.  As for these eight albums, they all represent comparatively commercial and formulaic, studio recordings by Oscar--\\"tribute\\" or thematic albums that would frequently limit him to 3-5 minutes per song in an effort to appeal to the widest possible audience.  All of which is laudatory, but not necessarily \\"classic.\\"<br /><br />Any representative collection of classic Oscar Peterson must include some examples from both of his drummer-less trios, first with Barney Kessel and second with Herb Ellis as the 3rd member complementing Oscar and Ray Brown.  The best example of the first trio can be found on a box set at Mosaic Records.  The second trio is best represented on several Verve albums--including \\"At the Stratford Shakespearean Festival,\\" \\"At the Concertgebouw,\\" and \\"On the Town.\\"<br /><br />Next is the trio, with drummer Ed Thigpen replacing the guitarist as third member.  \\"Live at the London House\\" is a fine example of this trio's work.  From here Oscar made a series of impressive recordings, \\"Exclusively for My Friends,\\" in the Black Forest chateau of a German jazz producer who supplied Oscar with a Bosendorfer and small audience, all recorded in lustrous sound.  Comprising a sizable set of albums, the first half of them were made with Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen (try \\"The Lost Tapes\\"), but not much is lost in the second half of the series when the places of the Brown and Thigpen are taken by bassist Sam Jones and drummer Bobby Durham (\\"Mellow Mood\\" is a fine example of this lesser-known trio).<br /><br />Next are the recordings made with the great European bassist, Nils Orsted Pederson (\\"Nigerian Marketplace\\" is a good example; \\"The Trio\\" is another).  Following that are killer concerts and records by the trio, sometimes in the company of a jazz all-star like Milt Jackson, Clark Terry, Dizzy Gillespie, Jon Faddis, Prez, Ben, Sonny Stitt.  And coming full circle, Oscar would reunite with Ray Brown, Herb Ellis and Bobby Durham for some sparkling performances in the early to mid-90s (especially \\"Live at the Blue Note\\" and \\"The Very Tall Band\\").<br /><br />There's no way to experience the greatness of Oscar Peterson if you limit your recordings to his studio offerings.  The man's outsized talents were way too large for the confines of Verve or any other recording studio.<br /><br />Here's one that will put you in the middle of one of Oscar's \\"live\\" overwhelming, physical, work-outs, demonstrating the challenge for a drummer to keep the hi-hat consistently closing on 2 and 4 (Martin Drew, who once disclosed his special exercise for conditioning the left ankle to be in step with Oscar) and for a bassist (Nils Pederson, who somehow could play these thousands of beats and miraculously emerge, not necessarily alive, but with all 5 fingers still attached to his hand):<br /><br />[...]as third member.  \\"Live at the London House\\" is a fine example of this trio's work.

B0036T31YY|4.0|It reminds me of an Alfred Hitchcock/Twilight Zone/ Outer Limits fim. It really causes you to think and you find yourself rewinding the tape to see what clues you could have seen to alert you to the twist in the film.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|I have the new Samsung GS2 for AT&T. Sadly this cheaply made tripod doesn't fit my phone and broke within about 10 minutes or less of me owning it. It's really too bad because the idea is great. This is being sent back and I may have to break down and spend $20 rather than $7 if I want something worth keeping.  You could likely get by with a phone that is 2.25 inches wide, but it still hits all the buttons. It really needs a design change.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|I see a lot of reviews saying that they are disappointed in the character selection. Bear in mind this is Nintendo Monopoly and not Mario Monopoly. Nintendo has a huge variety of characters and I can understand why most of the adults will not know the characters in this game however I can assure you a wii/ds playing child or older gamers will know most if not all the characters. Also whats to stop you from using your own figurines? You must have your favorite character laying around somewhere.   I myself am not interested in the traditional Monopoly, this monopoly on the other hand has peaked my interest.
1608191664|1.0|I am an undergraduate psychology student. I have no training in economics and I come from a liberal anti-capitalist family. I read this because I was interested, not because I was looking for something to back up my preconceived bias. The author seems to have absolutely no ability of scientific reasoning. He did not make a single argument that didn't have large awkward logical holes. I read the other reviews and they tend to be people who were already looking for ammo against republicans and love the fact that this guy throws in anecdotes and statistics all over the place. But essentially, that's all he does. He just throws statistics and facts around but never actually uses anything to conclusively prove anything. If I took a single chapter in this book to my research methods professor he would fail it before I got done reading it. He seems to have specifically gone out and hunted for anomalies in the capitalist system and used those outliers to prove that the entire system is a disaster. This is pseudo-logic. The only place arguments like this are valid are in books like these because no one can stop the author and say like \\"But that is an exception. One story doesn't prove anything\\". I do not recommend this book.   To add to his inadequate arguments he often argues things that do not do anything to reveal how awful capitalism is. He just makes up stuff. He claims that washing machines are more important than the internet and explains it, but does absolutely nothing to prove it. This section has no data or even an attempt to compare the two innovations in any real comparable aspect.   Or he makes up rules about capitalism that I have never heard before in my life and I do not agree with. He argues like there is some shadowy cabal of free market capitalists with a list of free market rules and its his job to disprove them. For example, he argues that free market capitalist claim that buisness should go transnational or something, and then he gives some examples ofbuisnesses that stay in their own country even though he says they would make more money if they went transnational. He offers no relevant statistics (He never does anywhere in the book) but just makes a claim and throws out some nice-sounding chains of logic that often have nothing to do with what he is talking about.   I think the author is a confused old man and is probably an liberal english professor. Hes made up facts for this book, hes probably made up stuff for his wikipedia page too
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|Michael Douglas(Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps)is at his best in Black Rain, a 1989 action-thriller directed by Ridley Scott(Robin Hood). Co-starring Andy Garcia(The Untouchables), this film tells the story of a hard-as-nails NYPD detective(Douglas) and his partner(Garcia)as they track down a ruthless Japanese crime lord that will take them all the way from New York City to Tokyo. There, they are embroiled in the deadly world of the Yakuza and must work with the Tokyo Police to bring justice in both Japan and The U.S. The special features on this special collector's edition includes a behind the scenes look of the movie, interviews with Douglas, Scott and Garcia and a theatrical trailer of the film. Black Rain has always hold a certain standard in action films in the tradition of Serpico, The French Connection and Ronin, and once you see this, you will concur. :)

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This cover is very light weight as advertised. And it is slim. I hate to have a leather cover that add hella thickness to the tablet. This one is just right. It's easy to hold with nice texture to it. I was so close to return the Kindle Fire in favor of Nook Tablet. But once I receive this cover and have this in my hand, I knew the Nook doesn't have something as slim and tight fitting(due to it's round edge). Using it as a stand isn't as bad as some reviewers said. It hold up pretty well. The only thing I don't like is the back part isn't black. Wouldn't it make more sense to match the front cover color? Well, just me preference.
1589946901|5.0|Blood Bowl: Team Manager is a very entertaining game.  Once one person gets the rules down, it's easy to teach other players.  It takes maybe 15 minutes to explain and you can do it while setting up and running through a first game.  The \\"flavor of the game is excellent.  Almost everybody I've taught the game has the reaction of \\"Wow, this looks cool!\\"  Who doesn't like the idea of dwarves, elves, rat men, and ogres playing an ultraviolent version of football?  The only issues that some gamers might run into is the game's dependence on luck.  There is skill and decision making involved in selecting star players, selecting upgrades, choosing what players to play, and choosing what matchups to play on.  However, some people won't like that die rolls and the luck of the draw can have a large effect on the game.  Ultimately, those who don't take the game too seriously will enjoy it.  There's enough strategy that it stimulates the brain and doesn't seem paint-by-numbers but there's enough luck to provide for swings in momentum and entertaining, unpredictable gameplay, which is ultimately for the best.  Note, that this is a game with a slight deckbuilding aspect as opposed to a straight-up deckbuilding game like Ascension or Dominion.  It does, however, share some basic game concepts with games such as those and trading card games like Magic: The Gathering.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|There's not much more I can say that hasn't already been said.  A beautifully written memoir.  I actually decided to read this book prior to watching the movie, and this has now been added to my \\"the book was better\\" list.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|A totally disturbing film. What starts out very promising as great Sci-Fi rapidly devolves into a inter-species rape fest (whether statutory or actual). Too bad because the film had possibilities. We never learn the reasons why the creations do the things they do or for that matter the humans. It would have been nice to learn more about these characters and it would have helped to have a better writer as well. Clearly, Writer/Director Natali has issues, possibly Oedipal.
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|Imagine 'The Road', but in addition to thieves, killers, and cannibals there are vicious zombie-like vampires and fanatical religious cults who feed people to them. That more or less sums up this film by Jim Mickle, writer/director who also made the impressive 'Mulberry St.'. I think 'Stake Land' is kind of a weak title and does not do justice to this terrific film, so I urge you not to pass it up because it sounds like a cheesy B movie. It is beautifully photographed and atmospheric. The script is sparse, with just enough dialog to keep the story moving forward, no more and no less. The performances are realistic and subtle. The fx are well-done and bloody as hell without being over the top. It looks like they only used makeup and latex, old-school FX, which earns extra points in my book. One thing I hate is the over use of CGI now. They even use it for bullet hits and blood splatter, and it looks terrible. This is artful and engaging storytelling that I don't see very often in horror films. I watch a lot of horror, most are mediocre to terrible, but it's the gems like 'Stake Land' or 'Trick 'r Treat' that come along once in a while and give me hope for the future of the genre. I give this a very high recommendation and don't know why on earth it didn't get picked up for theatrical distribution. The best horror movie of the year.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I got the Angery Birds: Knock on wood toy for my cousin. he loves it. with this toy instead of having to get on your mobile device you can just set up different levels and play angery birds right at home at your table. the games comes with the pieces of wood (which are plastic with is great as they wont break as easy), 4 little pig heads, an angrry bird, sling shot, cards, and extra point stars. while adults might not find this version of the game as fun as little kids. It is great for little kids as they can actually see how the game works and see how to move the wood pices and pig heads around to make it work for them.<br /><br />Bottem line: I would recommend this item
B0059XTUB8|4.0|I went to this movie not expecting Michelle Williams to convince me she was the iconic Marilyn Monroe, but she surprised me. Bearing a striking resemblance to the famous actress, Ms. Williams is able to project the vulnerability, the sensivity and the fragility that we expect from Monroe. She is to be commended for such a really fine performance. Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier takes a lot more getting used to. Even though he gives an okay performance as a sometimes stuffy, always impatient British actor, I did not see Laurence Olivier. Emma Watson as Paula Stasberg, Ms. Monroe's acting coach, is quite good. And Eddie Redmayne, the young man who plays Colin Clark portrays all the wonderment and awe that an unknown twenty-three-year old would exhibit should he be selected by the likes of Ms. Monroe to be her friend and confidante. Judy Dench as always is a terrific actress, whether she has 5 lines or five thousand.<br /><br />The movie is based on the brief friendship that Clark and Monroe had when she was in England to made the film \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" with Olivier. Although the plot is rather thin, the movie is certainly worth seeing, if for nothing else, for the fine acting of Ms. Williams even though her body does not quite measure up to Ms. Monroe's.<br /><br />Finally Lang Lang on piano is certainly a classy touch.

B005HWUBZ0|3.0|I bought a copy of this, Mayer Hawthorne's latest after hearing the single \\"The Walk\\" which I loved upon hearing it on 88.5 WXPN, The University Of Pennsylvania's radio station in Philadelphia. I still love the version WXPN continues to play. The version on the cd is trashed up with unnecessary profanity which ruins the cd for me personally. The description here called this an album about \\"love\\". A better description would have been an album about cheap sex without commitment or love involved, not to mention responsibility. The last song on the cd typifies this problem perfectly. Being a married romantic I would never feel comfortable playing this cd around my wife like I would the classic soul music of the '50s, '60s, & early '70s. Musically this album is excellent. The backing band is loaded with great musicians. Lyrically it is not much removed from the typical trash put out by today's rappers & metal bands. If this was an instrumental album it would never leave my cd player. Unfortunately the garbage lyrics will keep it out of my cd player. Call me a prude or old fashioned if you like. There is NOTHING romantic or love inspired to be found here. I'll stick to old fashioned classic soul music. It never ceases to amaze me that a lot of today's movie & music artists believe everyone wants to hear gutter language & talk that treats the opposite sex as disposable as yesterday's trash. This listener doesn't. If you don't want to as well stay away from this cd. This album could have been & should have been great. Unfortunately profanity & sexism rules the day on \\"How Do You Do\\". If you want to hear a very good, clean romantic cd buy Diego Garcia's \\"Laura\\". You won't be disappointed.

B00486070K|4.0|Wifi in my rural town is only available at a max of 7mbps - slow in general but excruciatingly bad for watching streaming video content. Researched some work arounds and it seemed a direct connection to the router might be a solution. I wanted an adapter that my nearly three year old Macbook Air and OS would instantly recognize since I am *still* working with leopard. Plugged it into my Mac, network preferences pops up and asks to assist me in configuring; the ethernet connection was up and running one minute later. I'm not a technically savvy person so this setup was almost too easy.<br /><br />Result: the picture is still not perfect but at least now videos don't have a zoetrope effect anymore. IMO: expensive compared to other adapters and not sure about long term performance since this is barely out of the box but I expect good things of Apple products and hopefully this continues to do the job.

B002VH7P4O|1.0|I wanted to get your attention and now that I have there is no doubt that these are the best sounding stereo versions of these songs. However, the mono is where its at. Mix wise, the mono just obliterates most of the early stereo recordings. I find it hard to listen to Day Tripper, Paperback Writer, and We can work it out in stereo with the left drums and right vocals. It's so annoying and if you actually listen to the mono you won't have these problems. On top of that the actual mix is better. So, in closing this can sound superior, but the mix and left right vocals drums won't go away. A new stereo mix is due and one day we will get it. After all, the Beatles recorded for mono with the exception of Abbey Road, Let It Be, Yellow Submarine, and some singles.

B005CW5E3E|5.0|It is great to hear Johnny come back with such a strong CD. He has been around for a long time. I was fortunate to have seen Muddy Waters in San Francisco in 1968 with Johnny playing in the band. I have been a fan for a long time and over the years I have had some great albums/CD's and also some that were forgetable. This latest CD has Johnny playing some of his hottest work in many years. And his partnering with Sonny Landreth is superb. And Vince Gill pops up and swaps some tasty stuff on a tight version of Maybellene. I would say that it is the best Johnny Winter music that I have purchased in 10yrs. Long Live JW.

Stereo mix is 96khz/24bit.

B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|\\"My name is Rachel Singer. In nineteen sixty five, I was part of a mission to kidnap Dieter Vogel, the Surgeon of Birkenau, and bring him to Israel to stand trial. We have always claimed that Vogel was killed trying to escape, but this was lie. A lie I have lived with for thirty years. And now I understand that I must tell the truth.\\" Rachel's (Mirran) daughter has written a book about her mother's triumph thirty years ago.  Rachel and her team were assigned to find and kidnap a Nazi war criminal and deliver him to stand trial.  When things go wrong the team is forced to come up with a lie, and to keep the truth from coming out.  This is a very hard movie to review.  While I did enjoy it quite a bit this is not a movie for everyone.  The pacing is very deliberate and does tend to drag a little.  The mystery and cover-up does keep you watching and interested in how it will turn out.  I do recommend this, but it is a movie you have to be in the mood for.  Overall, a very good movie that you must be in the mood to watch. Deliberate pacing and intricate details make it a movie that isn't for everyone.  I give it a B+.

0385534639|5.0|First I listened to Jim Dale read this book aloud on CD, then I read it in printed form.  I came over to Amazon to review it, but instead of writing I started reading all the reviews that have already been published.  You can see in the stars that I love this book.  But rather than echo other positive reviews, I am offering a review of the reviews in support of my opinion:  1.  Almost all the reviewers who gave this book one star complained about the lack of \\"competition between magicians\\", because Celia and Marco never considered their magic to be competitive.  This just proves that these people read someone else's description of the book (someone who quite possibly didn't even read it) and then compared the book to that paltry description.  The real competing magicians were Prospero and Alexander, people!  They forced Celia and Marco against their wills to be pawns in their own egotistical game... Celia and Marco never signed up for it.  Just because the book was wrongly described as a competition between Celia and Marco instead of their teachers should not count against the author.  Erin Morgenstern knew what she was doing when she crafted the competition between the teachers, and then designated the love between Celia and Marco as the only force strong enough to break that magical locking of horns.  2.  Most of the readers who gave this book five stars clearly have free imaginations and the ability to let themselves sink into a story, to find out where it goes on its own recognizance, rather than demanding that everything be laid out in a straight line.  More clearly put, the folks who give this book one star have no imagination.  They criticize the book when it is actually their own inability to relax and enjoy the ride that prevents them from seeing the plot and enjoying the characters.  These poor folks will trot happily back to their Danielle Steele and their James Patterson, and that is as it should be.  3.  I was moved to tears by several scenes in this book, specifically scenes of love between characters, not always Celia and Marco.  Perhaps it is the exquisite lack of garish sexual encounters in this book that so confuses some of the reviewers.  Without descriptions of body parts and their functions, some readers apparently cannot detect deep feeling between characters.  Back to your X-box and your Transformers, folks.   4.  Erin Morgenstern has repeatedly said that the circus itself is really the main character of the book.  The human characters are just there to help it stay alive.  So why are so many people surprised, upon reading the book, that this is actually true?  Why are they surprised that so much energy was poured into describing the circus?  Why are they surprised that the human characters are, in fact, only there to keep the circus running?  Erin told us that from the get-go.  Weren't you listening?  5.  Mundane people who read this novel will be completely unaware of the actual (non circus-type) magical references that run like a connective ribbon through the story, and so can be forgiven for completely missing that important aspect of the plot.  It is glaringly obvious that the one-star reviewers are muggles of the highest order, to use a Potter-ism.  They are staring into a portal to another world and seeing a brick wall.  Which is just the way we like it.
B00136RXGY|5.0|This smashing pipe screaming Angelic Demon from and unknown universe reaches up and brings the stars down to you with Annies voice. From the song \\"Why\\"and everything in between, even the strongest end up singing Little Bird from their throat. Her luring passion drives you down deep into the cavern of the soul and leaves you trapped there. The echoes from the music reverbrates from wall to endless meaning making everthing real.     I've listened to Female singers for a long time. Tina Turner was my favorite before she left the scene but Martina Mcbride and Pat Benetar fulfil it nicely. The fact of the matter is Annie Lenoxs voice does not have the respect that those 2 have. This is just wrong. Amy Winehouse had a good voice but if anything ever happened to Annie everyone would jump on a band wagon. Joey Ramone dying hurt me personally. Fred Mercury Dying devestated me because I never had the chance to see him with Queen(saw Queen With Paul Rogers..TOP NOTCH!!). Annie Lenox make no doubt,is one of the best songwriters and top tier of all female singers ever. Don't jump on a band wagon when they are gone, Ride with them in the hay while they are still here. Have fun. Great album! ONE OF A KIND!
0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus deserves to be a new classic alongside The Last Unicorn and The Princess Bride. Marco and Celia's romance isn't the primary focus of the novel; however, it is the catalyst. (I must let you read the book to see how.) Still, their love has a consuming passion like Romeo & Juliet. If properly adapted to stage or screen, theirs could become a new classic love story for the ages.<br /><br />I must note that the book is very much about an ensemble of unique male and female characters. This is delightfully refreshing to find in a young adult novel. In fact, there are two main story-lines to follow, as well as vignettes with secondary characters. I often had to double check the year and location at the start of each chapter to keep it all straight.<br /><br />The prose in this novel is captivating and full of imagination. My only note is that the author seems to not know when to use a semicolon and instead opts for comma splices. (But, only an English grammar nerd would notice.)<br /><br />NOTE FOR CHRISTIANS: This novels does involve Tarot card readings, poppet magick, rune magic, and other techniques that are practiced by pagan people today. These types of magic do work in the novel and may spur questions in readers. Even though I don't have interest in practicing these arts, I did look up the meaning of some of the Tarot cards mentioned in the book to understand their meaning in regards to the plot.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|seasons updates haven't posed a problem for me before. but with this one, I opened the update and told it to start downloading. for 24 hours or so, I've had the app downloading at 0% on my notifications screen and can't make it either stop our actually do the download. it's just a frozen notification, with out without wireless. rebooting the phone doesn't do anything. I still have the frozen notification, and no actual update.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|This app can easily take up lots of your time. Very fun creating different elements. If you like using the creative thinking part of your brain, get this app.
B001I9YOHW|4.0|This movie is a typical 80s teenger movie. Kids having sex. Bad things go wrong. Mom and dad are either clueless or out of sight. Anyway, it shows some 80s design if you want to talk that walk back. But the plot is pretty solid. And the one little guy who turns into a vampire . . . is the best!!
1451627289|5.0|This was an amazing book, filled with every emotion. I'm not going to go into details about what its about there are plenty reviews on that I'll just say that pick up this book and read it you will NOT be disappointed. I read this 900 page book in about 16 hours, i just could not put it down.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|You know the story, you know what it's all about, you've read the book at least three times. You went to see the movie as soon as it opened and then saw it a few times more. Don't worry, that's normal. Now you want the DVD -- well you have to complete your collection, everybody knows that.  At the very least, put it on your wish list. Somebody looking at it will know what you appreciate and you won't get another necktie.
B005NQ94KS|3.0|I would have given this movie 2 stars if not for the wonderful images and costumes. Following two people's lives over 23 years it's an ambitious project ... it takes an exceptional plot line, screenplay, director, and cast to keep the viewers interested in the subject (i.e., 84 Charing Cross Road). Although there are some very good moments, overall the movie is boring and superficial in presenting the main characters' lives, feelings, and reactions to events. Patricia Clarkson was my favorite, albeit in a very small role.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Hate it. I'm about to buy the game through marketplace so I can get the toolbox update. Amazon app fail.
B00650SSWG|3.0|A funny, modern romantic comedy. The plot is pretty predictable but Kunis and Timberlake have enough chemistry together to make the movie enjoyable.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire and had no problems installing or using it. I really love the options to see a week or more forecasts, and connect to videos, or see hour by hour for up to 24 hours. For fun I have loaded cities where family members live, or just places I want to travel to. All in all a great application.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I loved this movie. Timberlake and Kunis have great chemistry. The movie has a good story line and is witty and fresh. A must see in my opinion a total chick flick!!!
B005PTQPU0|5.0|The first time I played this disk I thought, okay, but then I played it again and I went hmmmm.  I played it again and I found myself thinking about Misty (makes me cry for some reason) and Snowflake. I just had to put the disk on again. For me, this disk is addictive, but that's the effect Kate's had on me from the very beginning.   My suggestion is to really open your ears and sit back listen. I think you'll enjoy the ride.
0786955716|3.0|I really like the design, artistry, and variety of the tiles in this set. Unfortunately, there are never quite enough of just that one tile that I need a lot of, such as a room with 10 treasure chests (like a massive version of the money-making-game from Zelda). Understandably, one set can't possibly have all the tiles you need for every encounter, but this set does a decent job. DMs using this set should keep their encounters on the simple side if they don't want to spend half an hour hunting for tiles. I love the fact that you can use wet-erase markers on them!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i love this game, I have mastered all 3 games - it is so addictive.  now if only i could get it to download to my tablet

B005IZLPMY|5.0|i gotta say i'm not a comic book fan of Captain America growing up. he was my least favorite superhero so when i went to see this movie my expectations were really low. about as low as the Daredevil movie. im a huge fan of Marvel comics so naturally i had to watch this movie. i was blown away by the film! they did a great job and Chris Evans of all actors did a superb job of owning up the role of Cap America. i instantly became a fan. special effects were great. the make up, the sets, the action sequences were incredible. looks and sounds like the beginning of a new successful franchise such as Iron Man. if you haven't done so, pick this up even if you didnt like this superhero.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the title says it  all have fun playing. i spend  a lot of time playing this game. so have fun.
