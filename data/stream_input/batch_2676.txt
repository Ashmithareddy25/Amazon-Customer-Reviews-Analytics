B007BVOEPI|5.0|Wow! So many people talking about it, I decided to watch it and now  Im hook , the  characters well played and the sets and the ambient really awesome.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This was a great story, unfortunately, what we have seen to many times recently.  Love the way she describes each  of her characters and then blends them together at the end.  I was keep in total suspense throughout the book. Great writer!
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|i feel that this should be Bruce Willis's last Die Hard. he's getting too old for that s@#t.<br />if he does another one i'll still watch it.
B00633W614|4.0|An excellent composition of feasible happenings in the life the characters in this book. Entertaining and informative situations which evidently spring from the Author's research and knowledge.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this more than cats hey if you think its dumb than your the fat lady singing and the ice in the water
B005JE7WKI|5.0|It seems like all you need to have to write a horror movie is a car load of college kids getting lost and killed one by one. It's way over done in American film. This movie takes that tired plot and flips it on its ear. I loved this movie! Thank you for making it. Far superior to films that attempt to do the same, this film is genuinely funny with a great story.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I saw this a few months ago. I can't remember any details about this movie, which tells me it was not that great.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Thoroughly, enjoyed this game and am looking forward to the sequel.  It is exactly the type of hidden object  &amp; suspense  thriller that I love to play.  It worked great on my Kindle Fire,  no problems.  I play and own lots of Big Fish games on my laptop and desk top and now I'm excited  that I can be more mobile with the type of games I love.
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|doesn't function at all. I can't figure out how to get this thing to work at all. it is useless.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was so touching and it is so well written I am so happy I read It and it was great that the book was told from several different point of views. Everyone should read this book 👏
B0085YOD1A|1.0|It doesn't function at all so far as I can see. I have downloaded several apps lately that are completely useless to me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books I have read so far. If you looking for a great mystery book you should read this
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It may be good, BuT it did not solve the problem. we had to buy a new Kindle Fire. good try
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I use it to hold up my Kindle to read while I eat lunch at work.  Plus it secures it and all I have to do is close it rather than turning it off each time.
B0045IPOPE|5.0|Shows the nature of all types of soldiers and their reactions to various situations that arise when it comes to a choice of life or death, yours or theirs
B003L77FYS|5.0|This is one of the best shows. It gives you both comedy and the who-dun-it parts of a good show!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|If you ever have had a dream within a dream which I have, it helps relate to this movie, the cast here all done an exceptional making it seem so real
B00362DRPY|5.0|I know &#34;Rio&#34; is arguably their best...however, there are still some brilliant songs on &#34;Seven & the Ragged Tiger&#34;.<br />My favourites on this album are &#34;New Moon on Monday&#34;, &#34;Of Crime & Passion&#34;, &#34;Union of the Snake&#34;, & the moody &#34;The Seventh Stranger&#34;. Still sounds great on vinyl!<br />Of course being from Sydney, I particularly love the album cover photo which was taken on the steps of the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney...lovely!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This is one of the best comics I ever read!! a must have for all comic lovers no matter what you may like
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The book was good, bit confusing. Definitely preferred American Gods. I will try one of Neil's older books next. Anansi Boys.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|It's funny cool and fun to play with I love  this app so much it's slightly Bette  then talking Tom cat
B00BIR381W|5.0|Was a gift for my daughter, she loves this program and I have been buying each of the series as they arrive on Amazon.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I love this album and listen to it all the time. The music is very cool. You will love it!
B001N3EZW2|5.0|This is perhaps the best SF movie made in the 1950s. With a thoughtful plot (inspired by Shakespeare's &#34;The Tempest&#34;), believable characters, and special effects that still impress, this movie is a must-see for any SF fan. It's interesting to see the many ways in which it clearly influenced most later SF films.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like the game for the most part! I had trouble on one level but eventually figured it out after 20 minutes.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book....very helpful for newlyweds and those married awhile. I highly recommend this for couples wanting to love each other better. Much cheaper than counseling.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app. I have it on my phone and it is very handy to jot down a grocery list or any other note that I need.
0062280228|4.0|Book #59 Read in 2013<br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman<br /><br />A middle aged man returns to his childhood home for a funeral.  He begins a journey down memory lane, where he remembers a scary monster who tried to possess him, a family of witch-like woman who helped save him and the tribulations of a growing boy.  This book was in turn creepy and a coming of age story.  It had horror, a paranormal aspect, mystery and great writing.  The main character was interesting.  The Hempstock women were an interesting crew of powerful females.  This was a decent read.<br /><br />[...]
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I always use this search engine.  I like this search engine. It gives me a lot of different items to click on when I am searching.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This mini-series has a compelling story line (many story lines in fact), excellent ensemble acting, and  magnificent settings and costumes.  Something for all.  Great show!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I always love watching clips and videos on this app. I am still trying to get all my apps on my kindle fire as it is still new to me.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Does exactly what I need it to do!  Let's me know exactly what amount of time I have left for all applications. what else can you ask for and it's free!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is fun but hard to keep the car from flipping<br />I recommend this game if you like driving and challenge
0061122416|5.0|Intriguing and inspiring journey!  The Alchemist was a great read from start to finish; I'm passing it around to all of my loved ones!
B0002HYFEI|3.0|I was SO excited for this. I thought my 4 year old would love building it and running the marbles down.  She likes it, but it's really hard to get everything lined up to get a successful run down the track.  I love the idea of the wooden blocks, but I think maybe something plastic would have worked better for us.  I wanted to avoid the plastic because they seem like they would be really loud.  Maybe it will be good when she is older, but even her dad and I can't get it working very well.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game requires a little more thought the farther you get along in it which makes the game more fun and harder
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I am really into past lives, future lives, present lives and so loved this movie.  I have watched it about 4 times now.  I also loved the make-up used so that sometimes you had to really study the person's face to know for sure who you were looking at.  The whole idea of karma was really at play for me.  Bottom line -- I truly loved this movie.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is the best game/app I have ever played it has amazing graphics and I amazing story pilot too I am looking forward to playing the next part
B000002KHF|5.0|I really enjoyed this album. It is very much older. But the music is timeless. The man has a very good voice.
B002MCYWHG|5.0|My kids love it.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|My husband loves James Patterson.  He has been talking about the actor who played Jack Reacher in the movie, so for Father's day I got him the DVD Jack Reacher.
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|Whenever I try to play it, it flips upside down. So I turn my Kindle and the game flips again. I guess I have to play it upside down?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Cant wait for the next book. I hope Sylvia keeps going with Gideon and Eva's story. As well as their family. I want true happiness for these people without torment.
0439023491|5.0|Love it item came on time and was in perfect condition. I have read all three books in the past but I just had to buy them for my collection.
B004QSQML8|3.0|The story is set in a make believe land with rather beautiful natural settings.  You can see Tom without his perfect smile, but the beginnings of his screen presence.  The  ogre that he must battle is really interesting in costume and makeup, but an evil force non-the-less, and Tom rescues the fair maiden in true \\"Legend\\" fashion.  This was before his<br />\\"Risky Business\\" fame.
B00A2YBDTQ|4.0|When I first watched part of the beginning, I thought Mel Brooks had lost it.  About two days later, it dawned on me that he was spoofing &#34;Star Wars&#34;.  Then, it became extremely funny (although a lot of slapstick).  Not his best, but pretty darned good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is so fun i love the app. great for everyone. I play it so much it is awesome for kids
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I was truly enjoying the game. Made it to level 21 in 3 days. Of course I'd spent over $50 on in app purchases but my character was awesome. Then the game froze while loading. I've only had this Kindle for a week and this game and one book are all that's on it. The help I found said I could delete it off my devise and it soils be saved in Cloud. WRONG! Everything is gone? I've emailed support but I have a very bad feeling about this.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Hahaha hahaha ha...... ha..........HAAAAAAAA ah yes the famous BTD 5. I've played all of them. BTD 1, 2, 3, 4, and now 5. I have to tell you, I LOVE this game. I mean I LOVE it. One of my friends played it and said it was fun. Other of my friends even watched me play it. Hahaha I've gotta tell ya, I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!! THE GRAPHICS, THE EXPLOSIONS, THE TRACKS, THE TOWERS, THE EXPLOSIONS,(underline EXPLOSIONS) EVERYTHING!!!!!! :_) I just LOVE it! 1,000,000 star rating!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging puzzles, lots of fun and keeps me thinking. Wish there were more games like this one. I can't wait for new rooms.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Not really much that you can say about this collection that hasn't been already said about these games. These games earned their praise as one of the greatest games for their respective consoles, all in one neat package for a low price. There is not really much to say about the games, as each game has been well known and there are more detailed reviews out there for each game. But there are some details that some out there would find useful.<br /><br />First off, we will go over the artbook. It's going to be a 100 page artbook with an embossed cover. The artbook is not hardcover, if that matters to you. For those who own the MGS HD Collection artbook or the 25th anniversary artbook from KonamiStyle, you will be slightly pleased to know that the contents are completely different. The artbook is filled with promotional images for every game. There are postcard images, poster images, and magazine ads from all over the world.<br /><br />Disc one of the collection contains Metal Gear Solid 4. Nothing else. I am unsure if it is the MGS4 Vanilla or the MGS4 Trophy edition, because I already updated my MGS4, but saves from the old game are compatible with this disc because they are exactly the same. That also means you won't get a new trophy set if you already own MGS4..<br /><br />Disc two contains the rest of the games. What is interesting to note about this disc is it is a hybrid disc, meaning it is a PS3 game and a Blu-Ray Movie Disc. Meaning those who don't have a PS3 but still want to enjoy the Digital Graphic Novel can watch these with a regular Blu-Ray player! The game side of the disc is an exact copy of the MGS HD Collection. Metal Gear 1 and 2 are still included within MGS3, for those who didn't know. Because the disc is the same, you can still share files you used to have as well as the cloud saves from your Vita. Like MGS4, you won't get any new trophy set if you already own the HD collection.<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 1 and VR Missions are downloadable PSoneClassics. And while they do not state they are Vita compatible, they actually are.<br />EDIT: MGS1 can not be downloaded directly to a Vita. You must transfer it onto a Vita using content manager.<br /><br />For the price, this collection is a great start for those who always wanted to get into the Metal Gear series. They contain all the games that contain important events to the series (Portable Ops is missing from the collection), so it's perfect for new players to the series. There are still some things in here that can lure in people that already have the game, such as digital copies of VR Missions and MGS1, as well as the Digital Graphic Novels, especially since the second one was never released outside of Japan.<br /><br />Despite already owning these games in various versions, this collection gets my 5 star rating.
030758836X|3.0|I loved this book until the end. Another reader said they went back and reread once they knew the outcome. I won't.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|All I can say is Wow! This is a shocker of a book. I thought what kind of psycho would kill people because they wasted his time. Well, we find out in this book which features one of the most horrific villains I have ever read. And I liked the cops who were on the case. They seem more human than cops usually do. I look forward to more stories of Max and Jesse, and I'm looking forward to seeing how Mr Thiede can top himself next time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played and I probably ever will play .So far I think ever one should try it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|continued excellence in plot, script, acting, directing, set design, one of the best series we've seen over the many years
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|you have got to get this app - type it out - what ever you want- then press the speaker symbol -and listen to what you just typed in-GET IT!!! GOT IT!!! you'll love it
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is one unique book. I don't know if it is a drama, action adventure, fantasy, or thriller. I guess it's all of the above. If you like blended genres, '80s references, and computer games, you'll love this book.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Just love it. I can't golf anymore because of disability. Now my games are better now. LOL  HAVE FUN AND RELAX
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Jack Reacher is the kind of guy that doesn't look for trouble but yet trouble always seems to find him. However, he has a way of dealing with it in a way that makes you wish you had his skills and abilities. The story was interesting and held my attention throughout the entire book. It also seems like the author did extensive research because the story was very believable. I would recommend this book for anyone that likes action thrillers.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Didn't know what to expect when I rented this but heard it was good.  Started out with the main character emerging from a dark place in his life with both legal problems and mental health issues that was brought to the forefront by a messy breakup. Very interesting characters in the movie that have some real quirks and some downsides but overall likeable characters. At the climax of the movie I laughed out loud even though their reaction was close to what you'd expect. It was the interaction with background characters that didn't know the backstory that made it so delightful. The movie was smart, funny, and sexy.
B000ID37RM|5.0|The best selling and most admired book of the 20th Century is brought to the sreeen by Alun Pakula and Robert Mulligan .  It was perfect for the times (1960's Civil Rights Movement) and its carefull faithfulness to Harper Lee's masterpiece !!!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Works great on my Nexus 10,  I love the breakaway magnetic connector.  I hope that they will use this connector on the next Nexus 7 as well.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season was just as pleasing as the other two, with many heartfelt twists and turns. I never want this series to end.
B00BSZZA3I|1.0|I was really surprised at the low quality of this case. I returned it because I didn't think the qualii matched the price that was being charged. I felt that it would probably break afte a few weeks of use.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|At first, you just run through a misty, black and white landscape avoiding zombies the way you avoid obstacles in dead runner.<br />As you progress, you can afford upgrades, like a guard dog and of course weapons.<br />If you are very patient, you don't need to use real money.<br />I like the many control options.<br />It's almost a five star but I would have wished for a bit less hazy graphics. I know it's for atmosphere, but if the dog is detailed and in color, the zombies could also be.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Follet's characters are as believable and engaging as always, the pace snappy, and all the plot lines well-juggled. He almost had me thinking at times that history might turn out differently. I can't wait to see who his strong female character will be in vol 3 and what she'll be responsible for.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|To much gimmickry and not much suspense or plot development. Becomes a vehicle for Tom Cruise and not a very good movie
B006CUDDUG|5.0|I avoided le Carre because I am so used to poorly written crime or mystery novels.  However, on reading the le Carre is a good writer, I selected this novel to start reading him.  And I was not disappointed.  I stayed fascinated with the story and the turns that it took.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I'll give this my long haul airline trip recommendation, it will burn and hour and half painlessly.  For sure not worth spending full price at the theater, but entertaining.<br /><br />What was lacking was a compelling plot, conflict, the story just chugged along.  A short visit from Boyd Crowder, (Justified), I begin to wonder if he really is this character.<br /><br />Bottom line, step up your game movie guys, with HBO, Showtime, and other fine network shows with good writing and character development, movies today seem like just a single episode.  TV used to unilaterally suck and movies were special, not so today.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like this app because when you scroll do to get your notifications right above it says what percent of battery is left and how much time you have left on it until it dies. I like it so why don't you get it.
B005N09L5C|4.0|Kinda creepy ....with all that is going on right now its kinda poignant if something like this isn't paid attention to and people let government keep getting bigger..... big brother might become a reality.......
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!!!!!!!I highly rate it! It takes you into another world!!! Just get it and find out how awesome it is
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Great movie - intrigue, suspense and wonderful actors. Play it Sam, play &#34;As time goes by&#34;<br />Here's looking at you kid!
B007KOYEOC|4.0|just the best book I have read in a long time..  Finish it in two days. Great story line just great
B008C40218|5.0|Great CD by a great band.  I've seen them live and they are very good musicians and an extremely tight band.  I also have and love &#34;The Black Light&#34; & &#34;Hot Rail. &#34;  Get to know them if you don't already.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|My husband and I loved the movie and so did my young teens.  Don't know why the bad reviews.  I would love to read the book now.  See the movie.  It is good
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|not funny. not fun. not very engaging. It could have been a lot better. She just didn't say anything in depth at all. It was just a bunch of anecdotes that were not very interesting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice to have a calculator handy on my Kindle when I need it.  It does all the things I need.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Of all the books in the &#34;Mitch Rapp&#34; series--the best. I'm going to miss my annual book purchase. Thanks Vince
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A must read book and I really enjoyed it. Very touchy and precise. You wouldn't want to put it down. Highly recommended
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|promotes theme that it is never to late to enjoy life and friendship. This comment section requires to many words
B006MW3V6U|4.0|We enjoyed the first season of Downton Abbey and the 2nd season seems to getting off to a good start as well.
B009JZPH32|4.0|Very Entertaining - Sex, Drugs, and Revenge is the new Seinfeld. Over 2 hours of viewing pleasure. A must see in these times of Marijuana legalization.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|There are too many &#34;buys&#34; in this game. You can's get through the levels without &#34;buying&#34; more tools. That's ridiculous.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|enjoy the game. wish there was a cheat for when you get stuck or a place to get at least one clue per floor
B00CWY76CC|1.0|This game, like the other &#34;escape&#34; game, is nearly impossible to get through. Not worth the time or the effort.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book! I'm glad that it didn't end with book one. I am currently reading book five and also have the infernal devices books to read next. I didn't realize that the infernal devices was a prequel, but that's ok, I will read them anyways! These books are so good that it is hard to put down at times!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I downloaded this app, but have had absolutely NO LUCK finding anything with it. A total waste of time and money.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|The program was easy to load.  Loaded on 3 portable devices & 2 computers.  Primary works very well.  Laptop and portable only test use.
B005SS2QXS|5.0|I bought the Griffin Protector case because I needed something that would protect my phone (prone to droppage), but I hated the bulky cases some friends had from other manufacturers. When I read the description, I thought \\"This is it!\\"<br /><br />This case fits perfectly, with a high quality feel and precise cuts around the buttons and ports on my phone, but still looks sleek and \\"designer\\". The slightly grippy feel of the silicon cover keeps it from sliding off hard surfaces like chair arms and the car dashboard, and makes it easier to hold onto in general. Needless to say, in just a few weeks I have already \\"tested\\" the cases ability to keep the phone safe several times; the phone remains in pristine condition, with no visible damage to the case.<br /><br />My partner also has a Griffin Reveal for his phone. Both products arrived quicker than predicted, and we like the one year guarantee. I would highly recommend this or any other Griffin case for your phone.<br /><br />Try it, you'll love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm so in love with this game. It's highly addicting! I love that you can purchase costumes so you're not stuck with the same looking minion. The only issue I have is sometimes when I play there's a lag, but other than that it an overall great game.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I like that you can rotate the pieces. my issue is you can't save your progress. frustrating having to start over
B00AVFO41K|5.0|Yesterday I wrote a bad review for this game because they didn't show how to play the game. Now I'll change my review because they put an instruction already but the instruction is not on the game but it's in the description. I think this game is pretty awesome except for the instruction but it's all solve now also this game is pretty addictive. I recommend this to everyone.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|It was good the first time I saw it, even better this time.  And now I can see it any time I want.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I read this recently for a book club.  I wasn't sure I was even going to like it given the description.  Once I got started though, I couldn't put it down.  Really great easy read!
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Underrated because of Iron Man and the Avengers but this was a great action movie. I can't wait for the next movie.
B001NAT05W|1.0|It's horrible.  A hoop shooting contest that would be right at home on Hey Jesse, she squirts some punks with a kitchen sink hose!  She makes herself look like Prince in the 90s and steals a motorcycle.  Honestly, that's where I got off the train.  Hallie Berry is beautiful, but even I have limits.  One of the stupidest movies I've ever seen and I just can't do it.  Someone said 10-12 year old girls might like it.  Maybe.... it's formatted like those disney shows for that age group so that's probably true.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|Grim humor with screamingly funny performances by George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, Sterling Hyden and Peter Sellars, Peter Sellars and Peter Sellars.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This season was not as good as season 1 or 2 but it was still good.<br />The ending will limit the future seasons.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Every character, every actor down to the smallest supporting actor and every line is absolutely perfect.  There's a reason no one's done a remake.
B008476HBM|3.0|Can't say I fell for Mr Darcy - or Lizzy or any of the Bennet's.  Probably good socio-historical novel, but I could have lived without it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great graphics and puzzles. Love  it. Needs more floors to keep me going<br />  Can't wait for the next update so I can keep playing
B002ROKQJM|5.0|I loved this naive/profound book.  Captivating.  Squirmed at life in the Darkness of India.  The Tiger is a good man living in a hell.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|The game is fun but freezes often. I have also encountered numerous problems when purchasing credits.  When. The credits do not appear there is absolutely no customer service.  My four emails requesting help for my missing credits went unanswered.
B00846REIS|5.0|Once I started reading this book I could not put it down. I really liked how there was more to the story than just sex. Don't get me wrong, the sex was very HOT, but Sandra Day did a good job of building the characters and making them come to life. Gideon's insecurities made him that much more real (well, as real as a 28yr old, handsome, rocking a hot body, multi-millionaire can be :) )Also, the fact that Eva spoke her mind and admitted to being jealous and flawed was a nice relief from most females in stories that are &#34;perfect, sweet & innocent&#34; and trying to save their man. The supporting characters also helped make the story that much richer. I can't wait to read the next book!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|We just bought this for my dad for fathers day and he has already finished season one along with season 2.<br /><br />Quick shipping. Perfect condition. Exactly what we ordered. No surprises.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I like it as it makes it easier to read my kindle in bed. So now I can read more often.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Love the dialogues and the way actors/esses enunciate them. I've never seen Psycho before but after viewing this movie, I wish I have seen it.
B00012QM86|1.0|The CD is defective and seller wouldn't replace it.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This book, was just convoluted and drawn out. It leaves readers with more questions than answers. Not horrible, but also not her best.
147674355X|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but this book knocked me off my feet!!! This is possibly one of the best books I have ever read! This book would make a great movie!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, I am not usually a fan of Pixar type animation but I am now!
B007R0WHMK|5.0|it was so sad what he did to these women and the madness of his mind and the end was great i will recommend to all
B0091REZMW|5.0|love playing this got it because its free doesn't bother me to wait on energy that's why I got it cause its free....
B001K3EXTA|5.0|i loved the period of the movie. all the wealthy people and how they manipulated each other that is the power of the rich
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|This movie was based partly on a book about Lincoln's politics. It's not a well-rounded representation of who he was as our President and great leader and a man of faith. Misleading and the movie wasn't all that captivating either. Two thumbs down.
B008D36INE|5.0|i enjoyed the passion of their love for each other and then it was destroyed leaving me sad it really told a story about a marriage

B008CLI4N4|5.0|You have to give a hand to HBO for having the guts to take on such a lofty and risky project. Even for a company as successful and well thought of as them, Game of Thrones was no sure thing. Though based on a much loved series, A Song of Ice and Fire by Gorge RR Martin, adapting it to the small screen was an enormous risk. Since Lord of the Rings there hasn't been a live action adaption of a fantasy series as large, as deep, and as populated as this. The world of Westeros is huge, with many incredible locations, a plethora of rich three dimensional characters, large battles, and a unique culture.<br /><br />So how did Game of Thrones match up to the books? Quite well, as a matter of fact. Unlike other TV adaptions of beloved books (looking at you Walking Dead) the writers of Game of Thrones didn't have the hubris or arrogance to think they could out write Gorge Martin and kept the story pretty damned faithful to the original source material. It's astonishing, really, how close the first season follows the first book. Oh, there are differences, slight as they may be, but it always seemed to me that most of these differences were made either because of budget restraints (there are a few battles that are glossed over) or simply in order to better render Martins story on the small screen. All the characters, the major events, the plot twists, the unexpected deaths, are maintained as faithfully as any purest could ask for. Its abundantly clear to me that the writers of this show knew and respected their source material very much. Such loving care is put into bringing the world of Westeros and Essos to life that I could swear Martin was involved in the screen play... oh wait, yes he was.<br /><br />That's probably the biggest strength of Game of Thrones. The integrity of the writing is unmatched in modern television. They don't make the silly mistakes the writers of Walking Dead make, they don't change the characters and their motivations for the sake of one episodes drama, they don't gloss over the more uncomfortable aspects of this world. Westeros is a harsh and unforgiving world, and the show captures that perfectly. Rape, murder, betrayal and murder, none of the horrors of Martins story are pussyfooted in order to appeal to as mass an audience as possible, something that is greatly appreciated not only because it is necessary to tell this story right, but because it must have been a major risk for the studio to produce. When we see Walking Dead stray from its source material to avoid showing rape or torture, I watch Game of Thrones and see those exact elements brought to life as real and uncomfortable for the viewers as they can be. It makes no apologies for these elements, but nor does it flaunt them. Nudity isn't used in this show for shock and awe or titillation as it is in Spartacus, it is merely part of the world and so is shown with such casualness it fades into the background. The same could be said for the violence. For the most part there aren't any long drawn out highly choreographed sword fights that go on forever. They are often very short, to the point, and very bloody. The fight between Ned Stark and Jamie Lannister takes less than thirty seconds, and that's  one of the signature fight scenes of the entire season. Because of this much more time and energy is spent on developing the characters and setting up the conflict between them instead of devoting all their time and money on big action scenes.<br /><br />I guess this is the time where I should talk about what Game of Thrones is about, though every time I try to explain to someone who's never seen it, or read the books, I never quite know how to explain it. Do I say it's a fantasy story like The Lord of the Rings? But that's not quite right, as this is a much more character driven story. To I say it's a character drama? Because that's not quite right either. Westeros is a fictional world where eight families rule over their countries and serve as wardens to King Robert Berathion, who sits on the Iron Throne in Kings Landing. When the Hand of the King, John Aryan dies of under suspicious circumstances, King Robert marches north to Winterfell, the seat of Eddard Stark, the Warden of the North, and Robert's longtime friend, in order to offer the position of Hand to him. Eddard agrees, and returns with the King to Kings Landing. Simultaneously an exiled King Arey's Targaryian has given up his younger sister, Deanary's, to Khal Drogo, the ruler of a vast Mongolian like hoard of Dorthraki in the hopes he can then lead his 30,000 man strong army back to Westeros to reclaim his father's throne.<br /><br />The story moves rather slowly at first, setting up the story and the conflict within it. Not to say any of this is boring, or unnecessary. It isn't until halfway through the season when the conflict between the two competing families, the Starks and the Lannisters, when things start to pick up and the political positioning is replaces by violence. Needless to say, there is a lot going on in this show. Without fantastic writers, and directors who know what they're doing, this could easily have become a wild mess. With so many POV characters playing a vital role in the story as a whole it's hard to given them all the screen time they need to become fleshed out characters while still moving forward at a pace fast enough to keep the audience's attention. Season one is the easiest season to adapt as there are far fewer locations then there will be in following season, and less characters, but even so it must have been very difficult to do. There is no filler, few scenes are wasted, and each character is given room to grow as befitting their status in the books.<br /><br />I haven't even touched on the acting, the effects, the overall look of the show, or the strength of the characters. Needless to say these are all top notch. Every character is portrayed perfectly, from Tyrion Lannister, to Jon Snow, to Eddard Stark and Deanary's Targaryian. If there is one complaint I can give this show, however, it's how rarely they actually show  some of the locations in this show. Granted, with budget restraints they couldn't Lord of the Rings everything, but it would have been nice to get some sweeping shots of Kings Landing, The Erye, Riverrun (which wasn't really shown at all) or Vas Dorthrak. The only location to really got a lot of detail was Winterfell, and it looked amazing. Even for being so briefly show, the locations look fantastic. I just would have liked to see of them.<br /><br />So who would enjoy this show, you ask? Well, if you're not squeamish and the two B's (blood and boobs) don't bother you, I'd recommend this show to, well, anyone. If you're a fan of fantasy, it goes without question you should see it. If you like character drama's, see it. If you like action and battles, you'll get that in season 2, so watch this first. If you like scheming, mystery, and politics, see it. I could not recommend this show enough.<br /><br />Replay value; extremely high.g Robert Berathion, who sits on the Iron Throne in Kings Landing.

B009NQZVKG|4.0|James Rollins' Sigma Force novels are great reads. His characters both believable and super hero's at the same time. Always looking forward to his next release!
0375701427|5.0|This is going to be the first of several Philip Roth novels for which I will post a review. To be upfront about it they are most likely to all receive five stars. Philip Roth is one of America's great living writers there is nothing in American Pastorale that is going to reflect less than a five-star opinion.<br /><br />I came late to appreciate Philip Roth. When it was new I scan read Portnoy's Complaint and was not happy with it. It's only been in recent years that I have picked up on his other books and had my nose rubbed in just how much I had let the reputation of that one book keep me from the rest.<br /><br />American Pastoral is the first of Philip Roth's America Trilogy. Each book in the trilogy will approach different themes and experiences based on major events and issues that would have been common to many East Coast American immigrants coming-of-age around World War II and living through the end of the 20th century.<br /><br />In earlier works Philip Roth introduces us to Nathan Zuckerman. Nathan Zuckerman is a narrator to a number of books and can be regarded as something of an alter ego to Philip Roth. In American Pastoral, Zuckerman will narrate for us the biography of his lifelong idol Swede Levov. From the very beginning we are told that Swede was a giant in their common Jewish new work neighborhood. Swede who was slightly older than Zuckerman is described as \\"one of the few fair complexioned Jewish students {possessing} the steep John Viking mask of the blue-eyed blonde\\" and furthermore he was \\"a star end in football, center in basketball and first baseman in baseball.\\" Swede will not only succeed in every detail of what was then the American dream but would live the kind of life Americans worked extra hard in the hopes of achieving.<br /><br />The 60s would be a catastrophe for the heroic Swede Levov. His daughter would engage in a useless act of political terrorism and revert to a lifestyle less desirable than the life in an old European shtetl.<br /><br />I suppose one could be glib and call this a riches to rags story and call it a day. Philip Roth knows how to use the English language. As narrator Zuckerman gives life to a complex interior monologue even as the author carefully leads you through the details and confusion attendant to Swede's life.<br /><br />It is possible to argue that American Pastoral is like most of the body of Philip Roth's work too limited in time and space. It is a very easy argument to make that the author is not interested in describing a universal experience but rather is deeply committed to a parochial detailing of life in one place and time. His people are too real too well realized and the emotions are too richly human to shrug this off as parochial. Other people in other places may not have had these precise experiences but this is the great drama of a great man brought down. Swede cannot simply rail against fate he must come to terms with the fact that his world came apart because of decisions made by his own daughter.<br /><br />Philip Roth is a great American writer and American Pastoral is a Great American tragedy made great by the fact that it is not bound in place or time.<br /><br />I suppose one could be glib and call this a riches to rags story and call it a day.

B0026IUXO2|5.0|This is truly a fantastic movie, as is The Golden Age.  Cate Blanchett inhabits the character of Elizabeth very convincingly, and it's simply a beautiful film.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|I liked It, but it kept going on and on. It gave the original story, but gave like 3 more after it.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|I enjoy this movie from time to time, every time it has something &#34;new&#34; and different to show to me. The performance and the characters make a perfect match.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is wired... but good... shocking... thrilling... scary...omg!!!! I would never do anything that in this book!!! She has lost her mind!!!
B0018M6J90|5.0|I have yet to meet anyone who did not initially resist the idea of this movie, and then become utterly charmed by it. It is wonderful.
B00ALM822K|4.0|A great follow up to looking for Alaska, a bit trickier but good reading, the emotions are more refined in this book, and I think more slowly delivered, with patience, John. Green is still a fabulous writer with style.
B00BYOEZTI|3.0|after watching a movie that was a million hours long...ending was horrible, good graphics though. kinda worth watching even wit such a disappointing ending.
0062255657|5.0|How to start?? This book was so wonderful, so different, so poetic, so hard to put down & I was so sad to see it end, I started reading it again. It took me to another world. Of course, it is a fantasy, but it is also a coming of age book. Oh so clever, oh so engaging. Loved it!!<br /><br />One of my favorite passages is: \\"Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they are doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. The truth is, there aren't any grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world.\\" I believe that!!
1454901276|5.0|This is the first book in a trilogy and I can hardly wait to read the next two. It is not the usual mystery, it is on a high level. I loved reading the story and suddenly come upon a profound observation by the author which strikes a cord  which we can all relate to in our own lives.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It wouldn't let me update it for some reason so I had to delete it then download it again. It said &quot;Open&quot; instead of &quot;Update&quot;. It's a really cool game otherwise.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|A great movie with such wonderful character actors.  Of course, you have got to enjoy the beautiful English countryside scenes.  It starts slow but draws you in to the final scenes of the movie.
B00CN8U60Q|5.0|You know how to attach to a band because you like the mood, or the sound? I felt that way right away with Blackmore's Night. Since hearing the first song on Pandora, I've collected pretty much everything they've put out. In listening to Dancer and the Moon, most who appreciate BN for their signature sound might be put off because of the diversion from that. Much of what you hear is more the style of Candice Night...but hey, that's ok. I listened to it twice with tongue in cheek attitude as my first thought was &#34;is this what it's going to be like?&#34;.<br /><br />In retrospect, they have done this in the past and it's perhaps a way for them to express other avenues of their many talents. After all, Candice's voice is just as haunting and beautiful as it always was. The lyrics, albeit different, were still just as moving. And the rhythm is unmistakable.<br /><br />So if you're a die-hard BN fan like I am, you will find something in this release that you like. If you're just a passer-by, perhaps not so much. But in any case, I gave this a five star rating because it is still good music, every song is different and doesn't sound like every other track and because it's well thought out and moving.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Very nicely done.  The locations and costumes seem very authentic and the plot lines are very entertaining.  Would watch again and again.
B00821OX98|4.0|This is a good scifi series. It starts off a little slow, but begins to get interesting through the first season.
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|Wilhelm Kempff is a master Beethoven interpreter, the best in the 20th century,  unmatched by anyone recording since this historic display of brilliance...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the puzzles.  Just difficult enough to keep it challenging and lots of fun.  Would recommend to anyone who loves to play puzzle games.
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|This app has taken on my email work on the Kindle Fire because the Amazon email app has developed problems.  This gmail app does it all.  The only improvement I would like to see is somewhat larger fonts or the ability to select font size.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Gave one star because zero stars is not available. This new app is hard to read and use.  Can anyone recommend a better weather app?  I have had this one for three months.  So sad because I loved this one.  Used it several times per day.  No more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game despicable me its really fun and a great game for anyone :) I think the game is really really fun and when more and more people discover the game minion rush I think they will find it cute and exciting.!!!!
B00AQSN7HE|4.0|I like all the James Bond movies and this one has plenty of action. That said I still prefer the older movies staring Sean Connery.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It has been to long since I read a book that really captivated me.  I loved how each chapter was a mystery - a piece of a puzzle that I had to place in context.  Beautiful and moving.  Highly recommend.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Thanks to Amazon Prime for giving me access to one of the best series on TV. Excellent storylines. Authentic costumes. Perfect ensemble of great actors. Looking forward to series 4.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Loved this game! Please come out with more like it.  Even my 7 year old granddaughter loves it.  She can't master the harder ones by herself but she loves the easy ones.  Please add more for this game that we can download or make a Patchwork 2.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very intriguing. A lot of fun. Very challenging a few times, but not impossible. As long as you don't use the hints it will take a fair amount of time. I love games like this and this is very original.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I enjoy playing this game but wish you could have more lives ( bubbles) than about 15 minutes worth still fun
0802473156|5.0|Enjoyed the book and learned a lot about how people feel and express love. My husband and I have the DVD series and use it in our Marriage Preparation conferences. In their evaluations of the day, the engaged couples  always mentioned Five Love Languages as being one of the best parts of the day.
0061743526|5.0|I am  happy To kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is being offered by Amazon,it has always been my number 1 book I have ever read. Without giving too much away, this story settles around a family of three, father,son and daughter in the south in the 1930's. The book clearly shows how life must have been during the depression where deep prejudice existed. Atticus Finch is a widowed lawyer raising his children the best he can,but children being children whatever the era, makes life both very happy and at times very sad.  The children play with wonderfully full imaginations, because of so few material extras, go to school,are mischievous and curious and are thoroughly lovable characters in the book. The days during the summer are lazy hot and seem long.The main story line occurs one particular hot summer when a young black man Tom Robinson is charged with raping a white woman.Atticus Finch is asked to defend him,which with the conditions the way they were and the times and the prejudices, is an almost impossible task. Mr. Finch agrees to defend Tom with an all white male jury. While Atticus brilliantly defends him, and with his curious children sneaking into court to watch, Tom is found guilty,even though Atticus showed beyond a doubt his innocence. To go beyond this point would be to tell too much, and I am not going to say any more. Harper Lee wrote a book that is without  equal,she bases the little girl Scout on herself. This is a book  so well written and so well received Miss Lee became, like Margaret Mitchel,who wrote 'Gone With the Wind\\", to  write only one book, because they were so well done that the two women  believed they could never write another book as powerful and moving as these. For me to tell any more of the story would be almost criminal. this book has to be read,you will be hooked on page one until the way too early ending,because as a reader, you just want it to go on and on.
B004IALZUW|3.0|The movie looks like a cartoon with newspaper-thin characters.<br /><br />Tracy is a sexually conflicted detective torn between virginal love and Madonna.<br /><br />A highlight of the movie is that Madonna makes an appearance in a see-though gown as well as a variety of wonderfully sexy gowns.<br /><br />Madonna created a music album &#34;inspired by the movie.&#34;  That album is brilliant.  The movie would have been much better if all her songs were included.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|as the end of the book drew closer I wasnt sure how you were going to end it.  Now I'm so excited to find out that there are going to be two more books in the Crossfire series.. Can't wait for Captivated by You!!!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I loved the game, but couldn't travel to other settlers... why play if you can't play with others.. so, I uninstalled it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My 8 year old son loves this game. It can be slightly addictive.  It is not gross and bloody.  I also enjoyed the silly little game.  :)
1781162646|5.0|I just finished \\"Joyland\\", and sat here crying. I've been reading Stephen King for more than 30 years, and this book has made it into my top 5. Along with \\"Full Dark, No Stars\\"...but that's for another review.<br /><br />As we know, books don't always translate well into movies, but I think \\"Joyland\\" definitely would. It was short enough to not be too complicated, but long enough to fill up 2 hours of big screen time. And if they start filming NOW, it would be ready for summer 2014 release...just in time for amusement park season!! Just a thought.<br /><br />Also, if you're expecting classic Stephen King and waiting for the really creepy, scary stuff, this is a different style altogether. But brilliant!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It's a basic calculator no better or worse than the one that came with the phone.  I doubt if I will ever use it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It's soap opera in a British setting with characters loveable and despicable.<br /><br />Of course, the setting is to die for.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Really appreciate having a game of magic always at my fingertips.  Triggered effects and activited abilities take some getting used to, but in general a fantastic game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the entire book in only a couple of days.  It grabbed me from the first chapter and I had trouble putting it down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I only wish there were more levels! Addicting game that really makes you think. Way better than other games similiar to this. Just try it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun for all ages. kids pres teens teens adults all very fun I like the baby minion. cute funny also the dad loo I love em
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Indeed season 2 is just as good if not better than season 1. In this season we see WW1 going on and just how this affects the lords and ladies lives as well as the servants lives. It is very involved as it reveals personalities of characters and how they relate to one another. Absolutely love love Maggie Smith. Her one liners are worth catching even if the rest was bad which of course it is not. Again this is Brittish tv at it's best!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Such an awesome story. The author didn't maximize the elements that she brought in the first two books. I was bored.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I always look for the classics.  This book is one that I have skipped for ever.  Don't know why?  Possibly the title?  It is a very good book and well worth the read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's rad it's cool it's awesome.BEST GAME EVER!!!!! It's totally worth buying. Minecraft is awesome and cool!!!!!! Minecraft<br />Cool cool
B003G4W49C|4.0|Despite unfortunate political and social views, Orson Scott Card has written a timeless sci-fi thriller. Although I could see the ending a mile away, I couldn't put this book down.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is a great story of a guy who truly walks to the sound of his own drummer.  I found this story to be very inspiring.  if we could bottle and share the essence of his rather selfless character, our society would be a better place indeed.  ps.  the music he writes and places is really good too.  some of the songs, you just can't get out of your head.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Sad to know this is a true story.  As an American I only ask you to read this book and why are we not doing something to free these people?  Is it because there is no oil there???
B00CW665VI|5.0|It's refreshing!. I want to read more bools like this. I'm super tired of reading what girls think of love.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching the movie with my family; it is an enjoyable viewing - with some interesting undertones.  The voice actors seemed to do a good job picking accents that matched the areas their characters were supposed to come from, and it became an immersive experience.<br /><br />Simple story.  Father is overprotective of his daughter, so much that he creates a little haven where only his chosen \\"friends\\" can visit.  Daughter wants her freedom, and to learn more about the world, so the father creates a situation where he thinks he can control who she is exposed to.  Unfortunately, this creates an opportunity for the daughter to meet a boy who is exactly like the people her father feared.  High jinx ensue as father tries to keep boy away, boy tries to learn about girl, and girl falls for guy.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|If you are a political junkie like I am or just a lover of history and well written prose not scared off by length, this is for you!
B001HPP2XW|5.0|Ordered for a gift.  Recipient says disc plays perfectly, received in good shape, timely, and movie just what he wanted.  Says all is just fine and he recommends to anyone this marvelous movie.<br />Cecy Ivie
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is very challenging.  it keeps your mind working. very good game. my 7 year old son was very interested.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|There's nothing to say about this show, the show was stupid, the 3-D was stupid, it's a giant waste of time and money.  My kids didn't like it, my grandkids didn't like it and even my husband was totally disappointed, and he likes everything.  Boring, slow, stupid, that about sums it up.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|It was interesting to see how the unorthodox lawyer dealt with a tricky ethical conundrum.  What initially seemed to be a one dimensional main character turned out to have some depth.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|I don't know how you can beat a free trial of a game.  This gives you a chance to test the game out, and see if your child likes it.  The game is around \\"planting\\" vegetables, and then doing the things needed to make them grow (water, sun, and fertilizer).  After things are grown, then you collect them to give to your customer.  Overall, a fun little game.<br /><br />Since it is free, you can really only grow a few of the veggies that are available in the full version.  This is not a major detriment (since it was free), but does encourage you to buy the full version to experience all that the game can do.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I have been waiting to see this movie on Amazon and it is the best movie I have seen all year.  Great acting, great cast; an incredibly moving story. The title and the trailer tell what this movie is about so no need for me to write on that but, take the invitation to watch, you will be will be glad you did.  Have tissues :)
0307742539|5.0|I just feel sorry the author is no longer with us to give us more.  I enjoyed all three of his books
B007VXT9HE|5.0|The more I listen to this album the more I like it. The records themself (there are two) are very high quality, much thicker than LPs of old.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|It's a good game not spectacular. It has very challenging levels. I just wish it was easier to unlock the chains by including the locked gem in the matched group.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|never read Stephen king before this book and I loved it.  Would highly recommend it, especially if you like the idea for rewriting history
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|The first Sanderson book I ever read was Elantris, and ever since then I have wanted to read more about this world.  As I understand it, this is a similar land - but in this land you don't have to be gifted with the shoad to work magic.  Instead you spend hours apprenticing to someone to transform an object into something new.<br /><br />Shai is one of the rare soul forgers, who can change the very virtues of an object.  Band by the empire, she works as a type of thief - replacing a true item with a forgery she has created.  This forgery is the same as the original in all aspects but one, a symbol somewhere on it that changes the history of the item.  This \\"convinces\\" the item that it is something else, changing the appearance.<br /><br />At the start of the novel, Shai has been caught trying to substitute a forgery for the Mood Scepter (a sacred item for the Empire).  However, just as she expects to die instead she finds herself in the unique position of being able to forge the Emperor's new soul.  However, she only has 100 days to make the forgery before the control of the Empire falls to someone else and she is killed.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story, it seems to be set in a similar world to Elantris, full of all kinds of interesting lore.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Does NotWork On Kindle Fire.  Nothing moves.  It simply sits there and I can not do anything.  I hope this  gets fixed soon.  Does it work on other tablets?
0385347774|4.0|Very Interesting.  I read it for a book club selection. Lots to talk about. Many twists and turns. Not as expected
0553582038|3.0|I do like the style of writing a chapter per character, though I feel the pace has slowed a bit from the first three books.  The additional characters takes a while to get used to.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|With the advent of 802.11ac, concerns over reducing network load over wireless is decreasing a lot.<br /><br />But if you have b/g, then you really want to minimize the number of devices on wireless.<br />And even if you have the substantially faster n-150 or n-300, WLAN loads can quickly become annoying if you have everything on wireless.<br /><br />You might think you don't have a lot, but if you're a 4 person family, you might have 2-3 mobile devices per person on wifi (smart phone, tablet, laptop), which is 12 devices.  If you have a PS3 or similar game machine, that adds one and if you have an HTPC then that adds another.  Have a friend or two over and that may add between 2-4 more devices.<br /><br />The number of devices on wifi can quickly become too much even for 802.11n - 300Mbps wireless routers.<br /><br />For this reason, taking as many devices off wireless as possible, knowing that there are so many wireless devices in the home, is often a good idea.  ethernet is also more consistent and reliable as a general rule, with fewer dropped packets.  Given that, and especially given that Apple laptops no longer come with ethernet, this is a pretty worthy investment.<br /><br />And if you're a traveler, then it's possible that the office you go visit, or the hotel you're in, doesn't have wifi.  ethernet only places are getting fewer, so the concern may last only for a few more years, but just in the last year, 2 of my 11 trips have been in locations that had ethernet but wifi was inaccessible to guests/visitors.  Which meant that a captive portal'd ethernet connection was my only option.<br /><br />Given that, you have two adaptor choices:  usb to ethernet or thunderbolt to ethernet.  When you're traveling, the chances of you needing that thunderbolt port are few, but the chances you have USB devices you need to plug in are high, so get this thunderbolt to ethernet adaptor instead and keep those USB ports free.<br /><br />there are, of course, other options.like Buffalo mini router or similar, which is a tiny device that pulls an ethernet connection and acts as a simple wireless ap.  But that just adds one more device to travel with, and the associated cables of that device.  This method is understandably easier.
B00CATSONE|5.0|What a shame, that even today, this man, continues to be unrecognized by scientists, and scholars.<br />Everything we now call hi tech, this man put to test in the late 1800's.<br />Just imagine the audacity of J.P.Morgan asking Mr.Tesla, how they were going to charge the world for wireless power. And to finally being a major contributor to Tesla`s financial ruins.<br />Tesla is the genius who while walking with a friend, stopped, picked up a stick, and on the dirt, designed the very first electric motor. By the way, that same design is still in use today, and it can not be improved...<br />Now, for the sad part, as if it could get any worse. If I hadn't talk to my daughter about Tesla, she as her High School friends, would have no idea who Nikola Tesla was...<br />Shame on our school system, and its agents of ignorance.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|I love this movie, but this Bluray is ridiculous.  There's a million previews before the menu and skipping them is overly complicated, on top of which, there are ads not so cleverly disguised as 'interactive content' on the main menu.  The extras are more ads and marketing for the most part.  I don't want ads on a Bluray I paid for.<br /><br />Three stars because the movie is good, and the picture quality is as good as expected.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|The kind of writing you expect from Michael Connelly.  Harry Bosch is a well defined character, but the plot twists always keep me in suspense.  Very enjoyable read.
B001NYCU5U|5.0|This album has excellent musicians on it, and has become one of my favorite 60's artifacts.  I enjoy it more now than ever.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|This is a horribly frustrating game. Even on the easy level u just can't bet ahead.  Don't use this game as a way to relax. This game is just too hard.
B006QF61VA|5.0|Robin Williams at his finest, I watched it again for the first time in years and still enjoyed the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this game is cute and cool. It's funny how their trying to win minion of the year. Can't wait to see Despicable Me 2
B005LAIH2M|4.0|The Unrated cut just seems to have some extra scenes of exploding bodies and blood fountains in it.  Otherwise, it's the same fun movie.  I don't know which version I like better.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great acting, strong character development, intriguing and suspenseful.  The events that occur are not unrealistic and you never know what's going to happen next.  There's a lot of crossover in relationships and ingeniously created factors that affect them. It's one of the best series to come along in quite awhile. It's my favorite TV series!!
B00AVFO41K|4.0|UPDATED, 8/13/2013<br /><br />I'm a bit slow in updating my review ^^;<br />However, I see that the devs were pretty good in listening to review responses! There are some great instructions now within the game (even stating that the point isn't to beat the cpu, but rather, to get as many points as possible before the board fills up--if you dislike this game style, please pass on this game). The instructions in game are much better than what's on the product page as well.<br /><br />I love that they added a mute button during gameplay. The game difficulties are the same (easy, normal, hard), though they made the game a bit easier to play (not as many orbs pop up after each turn (with the exception of making a 5+ combo, which no orbs pop up). They also added a \\"world rank\\" button in the home menu (also pops up after each round), which is a nice addition to see how well you do (and to give you more incentive to play, if you love ranking high).<br /><br />However, I want to give this game a five star rating (bumped it up from three to four, though), but I still don't see myself playing this game much, if at all (like I said in my original review, it's just not for me). Like I'm sure others have noticed, there's still some English errors in the game rules (making it a bit awkward to read), so if the dev could get someone fluent in the English language to just go over the wording, that would be great for the game as well (though it in no way influenced my rating).<br /><br />A great thanks to the dev for the consideration to us for actually taking reviews seriously and updating the game and letting me (and other reviewers) for the game update!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br />I just don't like or dislike this game, so I'm just giving this a three star.<br /><br />This game is like a match 5 game (I don't know almost all of the games the description described itself as similar to). Your goal being to match at least five same colored orbs. Yes, there are NO instructions and, after looking at the screen for a moment, I quickly found out how to play.<br />Basic instructions:<br />Touch the orb you want to move (as, again, your goal is to be making at least five matches in a line either vertical, diagonal, or horizontal), then you press the square you want to move it to.<br />The computer will add in more orbs after every turn, so it's key to try to make the best matches as soon as you can or the grid/board will fill up and then it's game over.<br />--so, if you enjoy playing this game, you'll be challenged trying to stay in the game as long as possible! (Before I posted this, there were no instructions. Now, there are basic instructions on the app info page! Thanks, dev!)<br /><br />There are some special orbs, like a rainbow orb (which you can use for any color). You can change the difficulty settings if normal (default) is too hard/easy. As a side note, there is no option to turn off the sound and the sounds the game makes can be a tad loud if you have the volume turned all the way up.<br /><br />Also, there is a button ad for another (free) app by this dev on the main screen. This doesn't bother me much, because at least it's out of the way and isn't in the gameplay! The graphics are OK--nothing to gush about, really. The gameplay is basic as there's not much else to this game. For me, it's not fun after a few rounds; however, if you enjoy games like this one, you'll definitely enjoy yourself! Though, I think an addition of multiplayer (even if it's just passing the device to the person next to you) would make the game more fun/enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, would I pay $1? Probably not, but not because of the game itself--it's just not my cup of tea.

B00DHQHAH0|5.0|This is an amazing season cannot wait for the third one to come out. Should be a very exciting one this year!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Lots of fun just pulls you into the game. Wish I had time to play all more. Good graphics and story line. More hidden objects would be nice.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|The quality of the DVD picture was not as clear as I was expecting. Am enjoying seeing the &#34;old&#34; crew again. Wish it had never been taken off TV.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple calculator, free, good display. Like the fact that it retains your calculation for you &amp; displays it. That's helpful if you're entering a series of numbers and get interrupted.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I have only watched one of the movies so far, but  I am completely happy with the one I watched.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|Great dance movie by Channing Tatum and his wife. High energy and the fact that he does all his own dancing is amazing.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Excellent movie!  My 3 1/2 yr old just loves it and the best part is Mommy and Daddy do too!  A must see!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I really wanted to love it and it was a good read I just thought that the book was ending with this one and was disappointed to see that the author is just dragging the series on! I love the characters and want to continue to love them but I just felt a disconnect with this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game. It challenges you to use your mind. ( Hint )<br />Most of the time when something is placed, it is placed there for a reason.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|it's just the best book. 10000000/10. It's just something to treasure and John Green is funny and sad in amazing ways.
0345472322|4.0|I could discover myself in the stuff Carol writes about, and I am now learning how to flex more to the growth-mindset.
1451695195|2.0|Although I cannot state that Eben's experience wasn't real, I just wasn't convinced that what he had was an NDE. The story did not focus on anything specific about his travels. The beginning when he encountered negative forces sounded more like a REM affair. For those who are interested in NDE's and read about them, then this would be another book read. However, if one is looking for any type of reality that Eben encountered, not sure this is the book that will help.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once I started watching I couldn't stop, brilliant show!! It will have you guessing what is going to happen throughout the whole season.
B008I34ZQG|4.0|I can't claim to be a big Frank Zappa fan, but I HAVE enjoyed plenty of his albums over the years/decades. Going to parties in the 1970s in suburban America, you almost couldn't avoid hearing Zappa ... all the time. And so, I've always appreciated his musical talents, and even his warped sense of humor, but I never became a huge Zappaphile. One of my favorite albums by him, however, was always this one. I had the double vinyl version of \\"Sheikyerbouti\\" when it first came out, but never bought it on CD until this year. So I can't tell you how good a job the new remastering is, or what the problem with the previous CD version was, but I do know that this 2012 edition sounds very, very good. Powerful and precise, guitars buzzing and sputtering and wailing. Really, some outstanding instrumental passages on these songs, highlighted of course by Zappa's guitar work, but also a very strong supporting cast. I'm not going to go back and list all the musicians; you can read that elsewhere on this page.<br /><br />Not having heard this album for the better part of three decades I was surprised at how excellent most of it still sounds. But some of the songs are just too silly, with lyrics bordering on juvenile toilet humor. I'm not gonna claim I've grown up --- I'm in my mid-50s and I've lost hope that's ever gonna happen ---but let's just say my tolerance for offensive song lyrics has worn thin over the years. And I don't think that the songs are \\"dated\\" in that respect, I think it was just a case of Zappa being Zappa, and I doubt he'd apologize for any of the offensive or silly lyrical content. Nevertheless, songs like \\"Broken Hearts are for ...holes,\\" \\"Bobby Brown Goes Down,\\" and \\"Jewish Princess\\" are ones that I usually skip when playing the CD. But the rest of the material ... wow ... this music still impresses me. Not many bands could produce a sound like this.<br /><br />One minor complaint about the packaging; it would have been nice to have the list of songs on the back cover of the CD, along with track times. Otherwise, you get a nice little booklet with song lyrics (ouch!) and musician credits with the CD.k cover of the CD, along with track times. Otherwise, you get a nice little booklet with song lyrics (ouch!) and musician credits with the CD.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Great story and the characters are loads of fun!!  I highly recommend it for someone looking for a fun movie.  Not necessarily for young kids.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|out of all the series I watch i am probably most stuck on this one...I love that the show offers more than 20 episodes in this run. The characters are all brilliant. Im a sucker for fairytales so if you are like me you will love it too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great reading, fantastic trilogy. I cannot wait for the other two movies to come out. I highly recommend reading these books.
B009MO5ES8|4.0|Though the plot is formulaic and pretty ridiculous, Premium Rush has a lot of high-octaine action sequences, impressive bike stunts, and enjoyable performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt in particular is a lot of fun to watch as Wilee, an old-school bike messenger who gets caught up in a series of events that finds him on the run from a crooked cop, hell-bent on getting his hands on a particular parcel in Wilee’s possession. Another fun performance is that of the cop in question, played by the terrific Michael Shannon, who plays his part with humor, intensity, and brutality. As I said, the plot is pretty by-the-numbers, but contains some fun action and humor. If you’re a fan of JGL or the action and thriller genres, check this one out.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|All the lights and stuff are just dressing, but the feel and function is great. Smooth movement and seems to work on almost any surface without a need for a mouse pad.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Warning - this movie will tear at your heart...you will cry, you will choke back tears.  I have never watched Noami Watts - only heard about her.  I will tell you, she can act.  You will completely forget that you are watching a movie - yes, she is that good.  I wouldn't watch with young children - it's a little much.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|This is about the best remake of a movie that I have seen.  I was worried because I am a huge fan of the original.  They pulled this off very well.
B003B02OOG|4.0|These short stories were very good and held my interest as much as the full novels.  They made me want a full size novel of each story.  Definitely worth reading.
B002PLALCO|5.0|My daughter had this and I had been wanting one.  I kept putting it off until now.  I'm happy I have it.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|This one flowed very well and was very entertaining. Some minor plot holes but not a distraction. As usual I enjoyed it very much.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|What a record! Vampire Weekend now has three great albums. I thought Contra was the best, but this is far superior. Best songs are Unbelievers and Step. Smart lyrics and original music makes this a must-get CD.<br /><br />You didn't download this yet? What are you waiting for?
B0044DEAUA|5.0|It was so easy to set up and install and it looks very nice. It was larger than I expected, about 5 inches long.
B00C1S945G|4.0|After watching some of the episodes in original format, I did not see much difference in the HD version from the original. Image was about the same.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this app. There is finally a facebook app for kindle fire. Awesome! You should totally get it! I really recommend this app to you Facebook people! :)
B0087X728K|4.0|Wow, just wow! This is a fantastic product, with very fast delivery. No apparent problems. I had to buy this because I was a noob while building my computer and used up all of the stock thermal grease.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|The snappy and funny one-liners in season 1 were not as sharp in season 2, but still really good.  You have to wonder, though about the whole story line.  I mean, why would a brilliant lawyer, and a hugely successful law firm continue with the fraud, leaving themselves open to disbarment and possible criminal penalty, for the sake of a young, albeit adoring, gifted guy.  It doesn't make sense, but I guess I have to realize that does tv ever make sense?  I can't imagine that Harvey and Mike are on the outs because it is their combined chemistry that I fell in love with.  In any case, I hope season 3 comes back with more snappy and funny lines and great chemistry.  It was the light-heartedness that I love, so I hope it doesn't get all dark and serious.  And for goodness sakes, send Mike to law school so he can be legit!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Loads of fun for all ages with lots of lightness to it. You can't go wrong with this game filled with action, playfulness, and mini games definitely get it!
071815780X|5.0|Fantastic recipes. Some of the best food I haveve ever cooked<br />Might not translate too well for US buyers, however.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|excellent performances with perhaps one or two too many &#34;carries.&#34; in the film &#34;carrie&#34; there is an unnecessary shock ending and then another. but &#34;the departed&#34; is so good, i just didn't care about the complicated wrap-up. the tension created by the double (or multiple) undercover agents on both sides is nearly unbearable.
B001A5HBAG|4.0|I only just started watching this series and wanted to do so given all of its hype.  It exposes fascinating themes about work and life in the 60's -- all of the drinking, smoking, newer modes of commercialism in advertising & tv, sexism, married life, double standards (at work & at home), etc.  It also has a darker feel than I expected and moves at a relatively slow pace.<br /><br />However, it's an excellent series overall, is quite thought-provoking, and provides a fascinating look into the work, lives and social/political mores of the time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great free game, loaded fast, kids love playing it. It is a fun game that is easy to learn, even my 2 year old can play
B004DHAC04|5.0|I know, there is a remake that is pretty good.  But it does not get better than this.  No CGI, great acting, a cast of thousands, a story line of love, loyalty, and the tenacity to show it and do it.  Four exceptional men, and an exceptional woman caught up in a time where atonement for the loss of General Gordon (also a great historian and contributor for Christendom in Jerusalem) is called for in the national psyche of the day.  The adventure is great to view, but the quiet moments afterwards where recognition and personal atonement between friends and loved ones, truly captures the morals anyone would want today.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|I Love thrillers so digital fortress was a good nail biter.  Although I am not computer savvy I think there was just the right amount of detail regarding the technology.
B004SDEP38|2.0|I wanted an app that I could just type notes, and organize them. This wasn't it. In fact, I'm not sure what I would ever use this app for.
B005QUQP76|5.0|Pro's:<br />Sturdy well built<br />On the fly DPI changes<br />Options for differing profile settings for button layouts<br />Scroll wheel is responsive<br />Buttons have a great feel & click to them<br /><br />Con's:<br />Could be lighter<br />Lacking color options<br /><br />Over All:<br />I can not state it enough that this mouse is a work horse. Great layout of all the buttons and is well built. I really couldn't think of any cons worth noting. Could weigh less with other materials but honestly this is not an issue. The lighting options would be nice to see if you have a color scheme with your computer build. Despite these minor cons, at its core this mouse performs. It is responsive and simple to use. Some have an issue with the (sniper) button on the side of the mouse, stating it is to far away to be of use in gaming. If the button was placed any closer you'd have issues accidentally pressing it. Where its placed now you have to make a conscious effort to use it. The software that comes with this mouse is simple and easy to make pro-files for many different games/applications. Over all worth buying, even if your not into gaming.
B00C5GZKVQ|1.0|This game will bore you after 5 minutes because it's absolutely terrible. I wouldn't pay a dime for it; it's a tiny little toy helicopter that you fly around shooting things. Sounds like it could be interesting, but it's horribly designed and difficult to navigate. Not even kids want to play it.
1936608898|5.0|When you really stop and think about it this is the way we all used to eat. Now we are spoon fed junk that comes in cardboard boxes and plastic bags, mother nature is far smarter than the greedy corporations that try (and fail) to mimic her.<br /><br />I have learned so much from this book without too much effort. Love it!
B00CH87HF4|3.0|A very fun game with great graphics, I just wish you didn't have to be connected to the internet in order to use half of the game functions
0142403873|5.0|This is our second Julia Donaldson book, we also have Room on the Broom, and the rhymes are great, illustrations are beautiful and the story has a good message.  My 3 year old loves it and I don't mind reading it over and over.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|it is a very fun trading card game and very easy to learn. you have to buy cards usually and you only start out with 30 cards Max
0425264386|5.0|My husband and I have read all of his books and can't wait for the new release on Sept. 3rd!  Too bad Mr. Childs only puts out one new book a year most years but I guess that's why his are quality work!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Dare I say it, but I'm really starting to feel like Daniel Craig my be my absolute favorite Bond. Each of his films have been better than the last and not since Sean Connery has a previous Bond been so outstanding in each of his films. Also Daniel Craig has managed to put his &#34;brand&#34; on Bond without losing the essence of Bond. Plus he and Dame Judith Dench have had the best interplay between their characters. More Daniel Craig, please!
B00821OX98|3.0|I like the storyline and that kept me interested.  Some of the characters are over the top and don't behave realistically.  Still enjoyable in general.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I have read the entire series and look forward to the ending.  I am very glad the series has been continued in the Jordan spirit after his passing
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I really like Miss Day`s books ( Crossfire Novels) and expected a conclusion in this book because it was supposed to be a trilogy, unfortunately is was not so. I was very disappointed to learn there are going to be more book added. I WILL NOT be purchasing anymore of these book. There was absolutely not need stretch theses books and add another plot twist as to who helped Gedion or what`s going on with Megumi and the nonsensical direction she went with the book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. One of the best bingo games out there. I play it everyday. Would diffently recommend it.
B0095P31L6|4.0|I love a great story but the animation or whatever technology is used to make these characters come alive, was exceeded in this movie.  I truly enjoyed it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a fun game with just the right amount of challenge...not too hard so that it is infuriating, but also not so easy that it is boring. And you don't have to spend money to get somewhere in this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game was fun liked the fact that it was not too hard even for people like me with lower IQ ratings .Game was just too short.Waiting for new levels.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I'm old enough to remember the real life events this movie was based on. But, seeing it laid out chronologically and being able to put personalities to the people involved, made the event that much more powerful. The cast was terrific and Ben Affleck did a wonderful job directing. I knew they made it out and my heart was still racing at the end of the escape! Well worth your time!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Mumford & Sons....need I say more?  This CD is an absolutely awesome introduction into a group that rocks the world with their folk music.  Buy this AND Babel.  You won't be disappointed.

B00007FOMP|5.0|I grew up in the Detroit area in the 50s, 60s, and 70s....Marvin was always on the radio singing his heart out.  Highly recommend this CD.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is good. The only thing that there isbto complain about is that it sometimes closes unexpectedly. Other than that this is a pretty awesome game.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|I for one am a HUGE Pink Floyd Fan. Always was and always will be. This is a great CD and DVD Concert. If your a fan you have it and will have it. The trailer is great also. About an hour of touring and personalized stuff while the band toured the world. It's always near my DVD player in my garage. Always chillin to these tunes. I wish Dave would cut a new album, it's time. Now that Rich Wright died, maybe a true Pink Floyd Album & Tour are in order. We can only hope. Until then this album and DVD does fine with me... Buy it.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|I think the acting is superb, the plot is magnificent, the director is one of the best of all time; overall a classic cinematographic production
B005H0IW6W|5.0|If you like Michael Buble, and you like Christmas music, you will LOVE this CD.  It has the melodic voice of Buble which rolls through your soul, and the fun of Christmas....all rolled into one.
B00D8RYV52|5.0|What can go wrong with Dr panda I mean of course it needs WI-FI and for that company I have plenty of names for a new dr panda apps so I like the apps they make but I wish they would create a new app called Dr panda's zoo like the Detroit zoo
B00992CF6W|5.0|She keeps asking me for my Kindle to play Minecraft, it must be addictive!  My only consolation would be that this game is good for strategic thinking development lol
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Excellent foreign film with an interesting plot. Also very well shot and great acting.<br /><br />It is rumored that an Americanized version has been planned.
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Curtis (Michael Shannon) has apocalyptic nightmares of being harmed by his close friends and family, and of a storm with motor oil-like rain. He builds a storm shelter as a precautionary measure while trying to hide his visions. But, is it all in his head or is the apocalypse coming? Take Shelter is an immersive and entertaining psychological drama.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story in Take Shelter. The story plays like a psychological drama where Curtis continues to question his sanity, and so does the rest of the town. His visions, both conscious and unconscious, are vivid and realistic adding a pinch of mystery and suspense; it may not end the way you expect it. On that note, the end is magnificent (whether you look at it literally or metaphorically), especially the accompanying music. It's heavily supported by Michael Shannon's superb performance, as well as the all-around magnificent supporting cast. It's tightly directed and written by Jeff Nichols. The cinematography is exceptional at times. The music blends seamlessly with the film and adds to the immersion.<br /><br />The blu-ray of the film is of truly superb quality. The picture and audio quality are exceptional, and the special features are worth your time. Definitely a great blu-ray to add to your collection, and clearly the definitive version of the film.<br /><br />Overall, Take Shelter is an amazing drama blending psychological, suspense, and mystery elements to create an immersive film; an addicting film you'll want to watch again. I highly recommend a purchase.<br /><br />Take Shelter has some violence.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love everything about this show. Great characters, writing and it is cast very well. I also love watching it with Prime with no commercials!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I'm a lover of the Rat Pack, and discovering Michael Buble when he first came out was delightful for me, and my daughters!  This CD is always in my car on the rotation.  It's so great to hear his smooth voice and the old time air he brings to verses....
B00CC9P99E|5.0|Standards is another stunning masterpiece from Lloyd Cole. He continues to impress as one of today's most gifted lyricists. The music from the unexpected rocker \\"California Earthquake\\" to the timeless beauty of \\"Myrtle and the Rose\\" leaves this listener captivated. Lloyd has always been able to craft beautifully written, soulfully tender, heartbreaking songs. \\"The longer you've been gone, the less the longing\\" is another shining example of how well he can capture images with words. Having been a dedicated fan for well over 30 years, I can honestly say that this is one of his most compelling albums in quite some time. I have yet to find a Lloyd Cole album not worth listening to, but Standards seems to exceed even past gems like Love Story and Rattlesnakes. Do yourself a favor and purchase Standards. You will be glad you did.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best written, and acted, shows on television.  I've watched each season several times because you never know what you may have missed.
B009ZM74F8|3.0|The synopsis claims this movie is something akin to The Matrix meets Minority Report...I do not see the correlation.<br />I believe it would be more accurate to call this an updated version of Orwells 1984 with matrix-like action sequences.<br />While I enjoy good pulp fiction and gratuitous violence...I would have enjoyed this particular movie more if it had less action and more emphasis on the theme of totalitarianism and it's devastating effects on the human soul and spirit.
0307352153|5.0|This book is a God-send! Susan Cain shows a true understanding of introvert characteristics. Her understanding and eloquence has given us a voice. I feel utterly validated. Anyone who lives with an introvert, or works with or loves one, would gain a great deal from this book; relationships can be saved. I highly recommend it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly never disappoints. I'm growing old with Harry Bosch and love it. Anyone over 50 can relate. The writing is always excellent.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this works extremely well and is very easy to use.  i found it to be versatile and use it all the time.  recommend it to all.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like it a lot the game is very good to play. It's very fun and people should download it.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|Oh hell yes, cannot get enough of this album.  Seattle Grunge Gods!!!!!!  Alice In Chains have definitely hit their stride with this amazing album.
B0056BMK6K|3.0|This guy must have more than 24 hours in his day to do all that he recommends in the book. If you have the time, I say go for it, but unfortunately, I don't.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|The chemistry between RDJ and Jude Law is still there and unlike the first movie, this one doesn't feel like a drag at times. Quite enjoyable.
159463176X|3.0|And The Mountains Echoed is for me the weakest offering Khaled Hosseini has given us to date. Compared to his previous works, this book lacks focus and direction, starting out strongly before sputtering out towards the end. It reads more like a collection of disparate short-stories, with only the slightest occurrences giving them any sort of link. Certain characters are thrown in haphazardly, seemingly with no rhyme or reason. The chapter dedicated to Adel, the son of ex-Warlod turned nouvelle Bourgeoisie, gives us a glimpse of life for the newly-minted elite in Afghanistan, but it seems out of place being presented in this book, the only connection to the main plot being a quarrel with a minor character. But then again the same complaint can be made for most of the characters presented in the middle of the book, with none of them making any sort of impression. In fact, if you were to limit the book to the first two chapters, the fourth, and finally the ninth and final chapter, you would essentially have read the entire book without missing any major plot details, the rest of the chapters leading to somewhat interesting asides that end up as filler material.<br /><br />Hosseini's previous two works, A Thousand Splendid Suns and The Kite Runner, were books with more robust storytelling that stuck to a central plot without having to lead us astray too far from the trail. This book is a mess, with many tributaries leading you astray before you finally find your way back and are able to finish the course. If these tributaries packed more significance, for example the many side-plots in A Count of Monte Cristo working themselves seamlessly into the conclusion of the story, then this book could have been much better. Alas is fizzles out, and you are left unsatisfied in the end.<br /><br />All that being said, Hosseini is an excellent writer and keeps your attention with his writing style, and that in the end is the book's saving grace.
B000XGDO04|5.0|Adele is wonderful!  Her music, her style, her demeanor, her enthusiasm for life, her ability to connect with her public!  Gotta love it! Can't get enough of her music!
B0002EXH40|5.0|What a great album! Definitely worth the price
0307352153|2.0|I wanted to like this book, and I tried to like it along the way, but ultimately, I was turned off by the author's tone. She seemed to have a chip on her shoulder that permeated her voice, and though the premise of the book is to open our eyes-and ears-to the power and promise of quiet people, I kept feeling like Cain was scolding me. Disclosure: I am an extrovert.  So is my daughter.  But my husband and son are introverts--quiet thinkers who often see far more than my daughter and I do.  I love how we complement one another and how we learn and grow from and with one another.  That's the warm fuzzy feeling I thought she might convey in the book: hey world, let me invite you inside the mind of an introvert and show you that we need both types of people.  When we work together, we can be amazing.  Instead, Cain conveyed a feeling of desperation and constant criticism: hey world, too many extroverts are shallow loud mouths who have money and power and don't listen to smart, quiet folks the way they should!  Surely, that's often true.  I know plenty of extroverted \\"successful\\" people who are disingenuous schmoozers and not very smart, but I'm not willing to stuff everyone into a category with a label and make one out to be better than the other.  In her defense, Cain does often clarify that people don't always \\"fit\\" the introvert or extrovert personality exclusively and that they don't all have the same traits.  But even though she continually reminds us of this, I feel like she really does feel like making it an `us vs. them' fight. My other problem with this book is that though it's full of research studies (and almost 50 pages of end notes), I feel like so many of her conclusions are painfully obvious.  Examples: solitude is an important part of creativity, so employers and teachers should allow for this as well as group projects; the most successful musicians spend more time practicing their instrument alone than playing with other people; we should seek out symbiotic introvert/extrovert relationships when collaborating.  These things seem pretty much like common sense to me.  Do we really need hundreds of research studies and a 300 page book about it?<br /><br />Yes, we live in a world where all too often loud mouth schmoozers come out on top because the general public is easily impressed (fooled?) and doesn't much like to think about or  challenge their ideas.  And it's probably getting more and more that way.  But smart folks-both introverts and extroverts-can see through this. I'm not sure we need a book about the power of introverts as much as we need a book (and a public service campaign) about the power of independent thinking.  We need more people to recognize high quality: high quality products, people, companies, and ideas. When everyone can recognize that, whether someone is an introvert or an extrovert is a moot point.  (nonfiction)
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This &#34;new classic&#34; ties in many lesser known Oz characters into an entertaining, and somewhat darker sequel to &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;.  We enjoyed playing detective linking Oz personas to the &#34;real world Kansas&#34; folk.  Some parts will be scary to kids under 8, but overall entertaining!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. seems to have a knack for playing arrogant geniuses and Sherlock Holmes was no different. I love the character but most of the time i was to punch him lol.  The bromance between Holmes and Waston is genuine and hysterical.  The movie itself is a bit slow at times, but it is a good watch.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|The $500M spent on production quality shines through. K. Spacey and cast are superb. We highly recommend this to everyone..
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is wonderful!  Her music, her style, her demeanor, her enthusiasm for life, her ability to connect with her public!  Gotta love it! Can't get enough of her music!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Was difficult to understand how it played and worked.  deleted it.  Unusual for the on line games for the Kindle
B004D2A04M|5.0|This holster is small but it's great and gives you a nice tight fit for your flashlight plus the 360º function metal belt clip of this holster, makes it hands-free flashlight operation. However, it's not for the long term everyday use and abuse because it won't last long, the elastic holding power will fade fairly quickly due to removing the flashlight to many times a day or using the swivle mount continuously because it will get loose and will start rotating very easy but if you were to use it occasionally on a camping trip or for hiking or just to carry around a flashlight on your belt while at work, this is the perfect choice and will definitely last a long time while holding your light securely in place, the snug fit will ensure your flashlight won't slip out.<br />Not sure why people gives bad reviews saying it's a cheaply made holster, this is a great quality holster and very reliable with a strong metal belt clip. I use this holster with my Fenix E35, exact fit since both are about the same lenght (see customer images) - Happy with the flashlight! Happy with the holster!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Always exciting and unpredictable.  I like being able to go back to the programs beginning and watch episodes straight through without waiting a week for the next episode.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Warning, there are lots of really attractive men in this series!  The acting was wonderfully done.  I did take umbrage that King Henry's hair was not historically correct, but I'll get over it.  There was plenty of gore in the torture scenes that kept the men-folk interested.  This is not a series for children!!!  I highly recommend this series, but for adults only...
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Book was alright. Expected more based on all the hype the book received. Beginning was very slow and hard to get into, but excitement built after ship sailed. All in all, it was decent, but nothing spectacular.
0857860801|5.0|Simon's Cat just makes me giggle with joy each time I watch a video. I didn't even know there were books until I came across them on Amazon. I had to have one! Love all the characters.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I think this is a personal opinion but my ADD kicked in and I lost interest in some parts. The colors were awesome but just okay of a movie to me or maybe i love original too much
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|I dint know much about this singer to be honest, but somehow I liked her story. I liked it because its an eye opener to all those kids out there thinking about being famous as something easy. It requires a lot of sacrifice, specially in your personal life.
B004IYWN7C|5.0|My wife and I just watched it.  It was still funny after fifteen years.  If your kids haven't seen it, they need to!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Better than the series but not by much.  These books are awesome and quick and easy to read while keeping you intriqued w/ more than blood and guts.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I feel like I work for NCIS, I love it! Great to remember amazon when I missed an episode and couldn't find it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I can see why this book has been on the best seller list. It is full of surprises with some well rounded characters.
B004LROUW2|3.0|1Q84 is a russian doll of worlds within worlds within worlds, that drowns you in rich yet overwhelming detail, like a dessert with too much sugar. In many ways it reads like adult manga, with strange spirits and bursts of sexual tension, and the abundance and repetition of detail substitutes for the lack of jaw-dropping drawings. Although there are whimsical moments of the supernatural and suspenseful, underworld veins of violence, the novel takes forever to unravel an experience only slightly askew, like a pretty painting hanging crooked on the wall. Though I found myself skipping over much of the repetition, I admire and respect the craftsmanship of the writing, and the depths of the characters' construction.
B00797MB0O|2.0|I was hoping to see a good movie despite of the reviews, but people know. Follow the advise and don't waste your time watching this.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This third book in the series was a real disappointment. I cannot believe how long it took to get it and I prepaid long ago. Not worth the wait. When months go by in a series, the reader loses the enthusiasm and doesn't remember much of the previous book(s). I no longer will order books by authors who have a history of making readers wait for long periods of time in between books in a series, and then don't deliver when promised.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Great game with different options and plenty of monsters to drive you crazy.  I just like building up the castles and getting new heros myself.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|anyone who loves despicable me will love minion rush a lot like subway surfers we could play it all day!!!!!!!!! worth no $ either!!!!:)
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This was not as good as Gone Girl. The protagonist was extremely flawed. The book did not have a happy ending.
B005OK725M|5.0|This was a good movie. Well written and acted with plenty<br />of action. It held my interest and it was quite enjoyable.<br />I recommend this movie.
B00271SFB6|5.0|Really, could anyone but Sean Connery be James Bond?  By the end of this movie Daniel Craig will have won you over.  This movie explains so much, it is the prequal...now you will see how James Bond became Bond, James Bond.  His car, his signature drink, his relationships with women.  Excellent!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game and its fun to play I play it all the time and we need more of this game fast
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|This is a great movie.  It's in German, but the action in the movie is amazing and well worth reading subtitles.
B003U6HQGW|5.0|Totally engrossing, amazing feat of endurance and a satisfying and triumphant ending.  Sadness along the reading journey but amazing to think all of it is true.  Depicts the cruelty of human nature and the stupidity of people against people due to their political opinions.
B009R659L8|4.0|Daddy's Gone A Hunting is a great summer read. I enjoyed the surprise at the end of the novel. This was one of the best Mary Higgins Clark novels.
B00821OX98|3.0|Sorry, this one did'nt hold my attention for more than ten minutes.<br />Seemed predictable and nothing new. Of course I can't give a<br />really reliable review because I did'nt watch the whole program.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|More revelations...this movie explains James Bond's childhood.  And the villian is deliciously evil.  Great match of wits.  The best part is we see who the real Bondgirl is.  Can not wait to see the next one!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|What an amazing product. This is high quality all around. Like many things, I thought I would have to sacrifice quality somewhere for the 8000dpi sensor, but no it is high build quality, for less than HALF the price of competing products! This is the first mouse I bought that made me feel like I was cheating while playing games.<br /><br />I dont think there is a company like Anker out there that provides such high quality products and such reasonable prices! Keep it up guys!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series. Very enjoyable and I don't want to put ye book down. I am attached to the characters and will be sad when the series ends.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|THIS BOOK HAS A LOT CHARACTER DEPTH AND ACTION. IT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT EVENTS THAT COULD LEAD TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Try the app,  My 7 year old son and I completely enjoyed figuring out the ten rooms, can't wait for more!
B007WOFXB8|5.0|I love all the older ZZ Top recordings it is nice to have them all in one place. I carry them on my bike.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for the next season lots of ups and downs very sad ending, the actress Maggi Smith is great
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging levels. Things are not too straightforward but you won't feel the need to bang you had against the wall. A good free app.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Reality more amazing and fascinating than any made up fiction. If you didn't know it was real you'd swear it was a made up movie script. Production wonderfully done. Happy ending, albeit long-delayed!
B00498YZH8|5.0|I did not receive this, I had it sent to my son, Scott Fitzgerald.  You should have him rate the product.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book was thoroughly enjoyable and I can recommend without reservation.  This should be well received by anyone who is a fan of similar fantasy series such as The Song of Ice and Fire and The Kingkiller Chronicle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and very addicting. they need to add more levels soon. I love it
B000002AS1|4.0|Acomplished my expectations. Great songs from a great movie. Everything i great great great. If you like the movie (I bet you do) do not hesitate and get this album.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I really liked the app before the most recent update. The new update has less information and is not as straight forward. I am now switching to a different weather app for my kindle. I am really disappointed and want the old versions back.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|Great series!! Ridiculously farfetched but thoroughly enjoyable (especially considering the brothers are not bad to look at). Am definitely going to by the next season.
B001TH16DI|5.0|How could this product ever be anything other than 5 stars?  I mean, it's Star Trek - so it's automatically awesome.  The Blue-Rays came in a cool package and they are the movies they said they be.  I mean...the first one isn't all that good...but you can hardly blame that on this product.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The author weaves together such an interesting collection of lives! I couldn't wait to find time each day to read this book.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very addicting. Even my kids like it. Recommend this game for all ages. Updates work. Fun to play anywhere. I do.
B005544TRQ|2.0|After watching the first episode, the pilot, I decided to go ahead and watch the second to see if maybe they got some better advice and writing.  Nope, it was apparent within the first couple of minutes that I wasn't going to like this series because of the writing.<br />*SPOILERS*<br />Just a couple to make my point.  In the first episode, a huge give-away to any lawyer, or those working in a legal environment, is there is absolutely no way a law graduate of any law school is totally ignorant of legal research.  And before that, during the internship interviews, the wiz kid supposedly knows case law on topic because he likes to read... yeah right, that's all you have to do to become knowlegeable in law, just read casebooks and of course they're organized by topic or whatever they assume.  Just ridiculous.  I can have suspended disbelief, sure, but the show is somewhat insulting.  When I watched the beginning of the second episode, I don't even remember what it was, but it was along the same lines as what I mentioned above and that did it for me so I immediately stopped watching.  In my opinion, it's just a cheap, gimicky, wanna-be legal show due to terrible writing.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Recording quality is excellent sound and video ! No regrets at all,  plus it looks like a book with pics and CD's all well designed !
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I'm a very hard sleeper and its difficult for me to wake up in the morning, this wakes me up no problem.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is told through the perspective of the 5-year-old and was absolutely mesmerizing.  You don't get tired of it the whole time.  And I felt like the author did a great job telling the whole story without going overboard.  Definitely worth the read, especially if you are interested in what goes through the minds of those in captivity or what people may be going through once they are released.  Especially with current events like Amanda Berry and her child.  Very very provacative and worth the read.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|love the game and played it for many many many years back when it first started would have given it 5 stars if it was multiplayer
B00D8RYV52|5.0|I have two boys, 3 and 2 they both love this app. There is plenty for them to do and they think its very cool to make the cars go really fast after they designed them!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|boring old stuff even boring for kids good graphics though. glad it was free, I would really hate it if I paid for it.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|This film didn't try too hard. There was enough in each character to find some of my own mates here. And the acting was believable and not over the top for the subject matter. I had a good friend die of cancer and this brought back painful and wonderful memories...
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|VERY ADDICTIVE AND VERY ENJOYABLE, EASY TO USE BUT IT JUST TAKES TIME TO EARN YOUR REWARDS. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ANY AGE GROUP.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love this game! It works well. It is so addicting I can't put it down.  A few suggestions I would have to make it even better, but it is great.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked all three of the books - I can't wait to see the movie and how it keeps to the books or not.
B00COO2D6O|4.0|i am glad I bought the game. .  interesting tactics.  decent graphics. fun.  looking forward to trying more levels and upgrades.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Pam's writing style ... she had me laughing. Her ideas and the experiments she proposed were right on. This book is certainly well worth reading and working with.  I did find myself skipping through the parts where she goes into the &#34;limitations&#34; of religious indoctrination from bible belt areas of the U.S. Other readers might have gained from it. You will notice that I still gave it 5 stars.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Minecraft is cool and it is one of the coolest games I ever played and I play on it a lot with all my friends minecraft:-)
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I'm so bummed that I have to wait for the series to come out on DVD.  Every one is amazing.

0425252868|5.0|Excellent book about 2 separate lives from 2 different countries at war that encounter each other one day over Germany-with an unexpected outcome, well written and easy to understand
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|It's fun a lot but when it said that I needed friends so I put facebook but then there authorize to go on it but it says that I can't so it knows all most every thing about me and its no fair<br />&quot;<br />-

B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Jeffrey Archer is a great story teller and all his books have that cant put it down in common.  Harry Clifton is a very likeable and enjoyable character.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|All I can say is its freaking amazing!! Definitely not a piece of klunk! I DON'T WANT THIS STORY TO END! WICKED is good
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|I have seen ET many times and I never get bored with it. It's cute, funny, serious, and most of all it has a lesson to be learned.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Never a dull moment, adventure, romance, love and faith. It is all here. The importance of truth the need of family and the understanding of heritage. I love this story, so far one of the best series I have read. You get lost in the saga so easy you find yourself hours later not realizing the time passage. Oh and I love the way they say arse...
0345536886|5.0|The classic Grisham novel that I enjoy so much.<br />Nice characters, great story development and as always a few unexpected twists in the plot.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig is by far the best James Bond ever! This movie was great, I recommend to all 007 fans.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Almost everybody by now has heard &#34;Radioactive,&#34; but listen to the other tracks. &#34;Demons&#34; is excellent song, and the rest of the album brings forth the best from this band.
B004G6009U|5.0|This is my second DVD for Tangled, my 3 year old granddaughter watched it so much she wore out the first one, and is now in the process of wearing this one out.  Thanks for the quick delivery and great DVD.  L. Dinges
B0046B3QTG|4.0|I liked it and my only complaint is that I wanted more Minion scenes in it. They stole the show IMP. They are the only reason I want to see DP-2
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Accidently found this program.  My wife and I fell in love with the show.  The characters and the period are very interesting and there are always plot twists in every episode.  One of the best shows on TV
0618918248|5.0|A rousing discussion of arguments for and against the existence of a &#34; supreme being&#34;...and a diatribe against religion! Very thought provoking but I found the  last half of the book to be arcane and not really necessary.
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|This movie was a total waste of time!! My wife and I maybe cracked a smile at a few parts of the movie and we couldn't even stay interested enough to make it to the ending.
B008G12ERC|4.0|I had my itroduction to Muse vie Resistence which I love and listen to all the time. I was happy to hear thewy has a new album coming out. 2nd Law is a solid  record with only one stand out for me which is, &#34;Madness.&#34; I love this record as well, but....it doesn't havew the same soic push as Resistence does, and vibe is a little more subdue . I am in the process of buying their other records so I am big fan. If you like, &#34;Madness&#34; than the rest of the album, if you are a new fan to Muse, then this album will blow your sock off. For me, I cannot seem to not compare it to Resistence.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book was amazing! It was well thought out and it was beautifully written. The author gave an interesting thing to think about. He made the reader think and wonder.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I think the cast did a WONDERFUL job.  I've already watched it three times!  LOVE IT!!  If you've seen, Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, this ties in quite nicely!  Also, I like this Hulk better than the original one.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|The storyline for Spartacus is great. I watched Gods of the Arena and Blood and Sands...I was glad to find out that there were two more seasons...I like how the series tells about all of the characters and how they got to the arena...can't wait to see the next season.
B00697RJDE|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the letters that went with each of the blocks.  The things that were important at the time are still important today.  I'm looking forward to startig the quilt,  I wish I could find pre cut temolates, though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It was challenging without being impossible and it's a lot of fun. My only complaint is it needs more levels.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Sophie is so witty & entertaining with her stories, it was a super fun/fast read! Highly recommend for some good laughter!
B004SBULWE|5.0|Its very helpful to see if you left apps open running down your battery.  I like that it not only shuts them down but I can see what is running om my device.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I went to check my local weather only to discover the app had been destroyed. Not user friendly at all. Childish icons, in your face graphics. Will be deleting.
B00933JL0A|5.0|Pros- different map sizes, different terrain, seasons, scenarios which you have to complete an objective if you fail it doesn't lose the game, free, very realistic concepts<br />Cons- not many except for ads but there is a premium version that costs 1.25
B000H0MKOM|4.0|This movie is fun to watch just for entertainment,  makes you feel good for the average guy.  We really enjiyed it.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I love Dexter and will be ready to sit down and watch each season of Dexter, I have them all.  I am hand quilting as I watch this.
B002P79KAC|5.0|the character development, writing and general wit of the series consistently make you laugh and draw you into the lives of the players
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife is just as advertised. Extremely tough and well made blade. Came razor sharp out of the box and has held its' edge extremely well. Very good all around camp/survival knife. Its' bulk and blade thickness make it surprisingly good for processing wood with a smaller blade than a typical big chopper.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />GREAT all purpose knife.<br />Edge was razor sharp out of the box however it was not symmetrical but this is to be expected at this price point. After reworking and sharpening it is perfect and does not need to be sharpened often. I did abuse this knife early on, carelessly batoning through wood straight into the ground and/or into rocks but it has more than held up. On my last trip it proved to be a better chopper on hard wood (3-6\\" diameter) than my estwing E14A. I took a gamble on a less expensive knife and got Lucky. Great steel and design.
B00BHBBSZ2|2.0|I bought this because I thought I could take notes faster by writing instead of typing. I bought a stylus,but couldn't see what I was writing. It skipped and was very small. It may be my error,but I couldn't use it.
159463176X|5.0|I was so anxious to read it.  I have completed about 75%, and it has met my expectations so far. Don't want it to end.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|THe slow pace of the movie and the beautiful scenery of India make this a great movie to watch.  THe plot was believable and watching was a fun, relaxing way to spend an afternoon.  Some of the great British actors and actresses only enhanced an already enjoyable experience.  It was good to see them again.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I cannot get HBO so I order the sets as they come out.  I will be hand quilting and watching Game of Thrones
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|It kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through, very thrilling, & easy to read, very enjoyable
B004H4XI5O|4.0|This is well written but a little dragged out.  The author becomes curious about people with amazing memories and follows them to competitions and then learns how to do it.  The techniques are interesting and they work if you are willing to put in the massive amount of work required to really excel.  But even if you don't want to work that hard, you will pick up some useful tricks.<br /><br />The author makes the point at the end, that as good as these techniques are, they don't improve your everyday memory - like where you put your keys, etc., but they do give you ways to memorize long lists of things from numbers to poetry, etc., if you want to do that.  It is well worth the read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game. It is fun and challenges. Of course, it is enjoyable. I cannot stop playing the game.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Very nice I really like this game with the cool zombies, i really want to play more n more. I think this game is for everyone to play because it's so interesting. I really wanna play more. I luv to say more but I'm going back to play Samaria vs zombie Tata everyone!
0547884591|1.0|Inauthentic is the word that keeps popping into my mind - a dash of faux Fäviken, a pinch of imitation David Chang/ Lucky Peach, Trimalchio and Argosy, I do not believe for a minute this book could really help anyone learn to cook. I could go on and on, but many other reviewers have covered the negatives quite well. If the book wasn't so silly, it would be downright frightening. If I were Tim Ferriss I would take some time off and reflect on where my career is going.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Easy way to waste more time than you intended.  Very addictive and a fast paced game too<br />Sorry for the short review
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait to see where Eva and Gideon go from here as always once I started it I couldn't put it down!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|While not the first vehicle to address dreams within dreams, Inception can't be accused of being derivative.  With a cohesive plot, engaging characters, and excellent acting, this movie is one of my all time favorites.  The story's structure, while incredible, is plausible within the context of the premise.  The synchronization in the different layers to achieve the simultaneous exits was a bit of a stretch but still enjoyable as they contributed to the suspense of whether they would succeed.<br /><br />I grew up reading science fiction, so had no difficulty following the story or understanding the complex concepts of the layers, the time shifts, and the connections between and dependencies on the layer chain.  Ultimately, this movie delivers superior entertainment.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|easy at first but it gets harder. it keeps you thinking about puzzle options.  I like it and will keep playing. curious as to how many levels.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my 12 year old son.  My son loves it, and plays with it quite often.  It is great on trips for amusing kids in the car, and our niece, who is 11 months old was also quite taken with it!  Instead of buying just another baby toy, I would suggest buying the Perplexus for a small child as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|We all need a Christian Grey in our lives. What a beautiful love story. I have read this book twice already. It like my favorite movie.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I have enjoyed this puzzle app so far.  Sometimes it's hard to retrieve the puzzle pieces from the side bar but over all I like the puzzles and that I can choose the level of difficulty.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Because of the good reviews, I wanted to like this game. It never did quite download on my Kindle Fire. Tablet froze.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|I was surprised by how large this pool was.  Love the water sprinkler effects.  However, the slide sticks and kids cannot easily slide down unless you run water on it as they play.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The large cast of characters and all their stories add so much intrigue to the overall story I can't wait to watch the next epsode.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|My son just started into astronomy and loves this app. Best feature is the &#34;red&#34; light so you don't lose your night vision while using this app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I feel empty without my Greys. I need at least 2 more books maybe from Christians perspective. Awesome. In awe of James' imangination
B00006IU73|5.0|First heard some of this music through one of my Pandora channels.  It intrigued.  A friend had this very album and played it.  Hearing more than one song was the clincher and I purchased this soon after.  Love it!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I have seen The Help several times before, but my Mom and Dad hadn't seen it. So it was interesting watching their reactions to the movie. It takes you through a whole range of emotions as you follow the story of these courageous women who risked everything to expose the truth. Love it and highly recommend it!
B00AVFO41K|2.0|There are no instructions for this game. However it's a pretty simple concept. You move pieces around on the board to line them up in 5's in any direction. Some of the colored dots have special powers which are pretty easy to figure out what they do. Keep moving pieces and removing them until the boards fills up and you can't move any more then the game is over. It's a really basic game with decent graphics. Nothing special I will be keeping.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I remember watching these with my parents when I was younger. I loved it. At that time it was the bomb.

B00005JKJA|5.0|To me, this film is all the proof you'll ever need to understand that Naomi is the best actress of her generation! And such a natural beauty, too.<br /><br />A stunning cast, a highly complex and enjoyable script, a most intriguing soundtrack, i.e. all the art of David Lynch wrapped up in one film (well, actually, this is  a number of films all wrapped up in one, to be honest). I am not generally a fan of David Lynch's, but &#34;Mulholland Drive&#34; is definitely on of my all-time favourites.<br /><br />Watch it with some time and a glass of good wine at hand. This is a film that will only work if you allow it to draw you in.<br /><br />Enjoy :-)
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My neighbors 4 year old daughter and I both love this app. It entertains us for hours! I recommend it
B00CATSONE|1.0|This is merely a self-serving ad for the author's &#34;other&#34; book that he wants to sell to you.  A waste of time.  Interesting story, but nothing that you couldn't dig out from other sources.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|As a youth back in the 70s and 80s I loved Abba. Since then, I have always dreamed that they would rise again to produce more of the wondrous music that so enchanted me when I was young.  In this album Agnetha Faltskog, the crown jewel of this amazing group, has emerged years later to produce an album that is charming, enchanting, sweet and melodic. Years have done nothing to diminish her pop creativity. Agnetha's singing is energetic and impassioned and her songs carry all the same charm as the tunes back in the original Abba. All of the tunes on this album are great but my favorite is the piece she did with Gary Barlow. If you are a fan of Abba, you will adore this album.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was a great experience for this first time user...... I will be doing this again.  Can't wait to watch another show, I seem to have missed a few.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|No info on game objection or how to play the game, what the different pieces represented, scoring. I did like the graphics. I deleted it, sorry it wasn't for me. Thanks anyway.  Good luck to everybody that plays.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|tom cruise showing he still has gusto in this action movie. good premise and supporting roles. new comer jai courtney is badass. warner herzog makes rare onscreen appearance.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I had cases of slides my fater had taken and no way to really enjoy them.  Using this scanner I was able to turn the slides into digital and can view them all and print whenever I want.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|This game is just okay because they don't talk.  My daughter wants them to tip her and tell her they love their hair.  It is an ok game for kids 4-8.
B00DM0UTPQ|4.0|This movie was surprisingly good.  Ed Harris, as usual, is excellent and David Duchovny plays a convincing 'bad guy'.  The plot is plausible (minus the secret technology element) and it explores a moment in history that has not previously been covered.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Be prepared to learn the new ABC and to pitch, improvise and serve.<br />The world will be a better place after you read this book.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|Only downloads certain videos and certain videos you have to have wifi to look at! All in all great product!
B0058VW36U|1.0|With all their content they charge now, whenever the \\"Go Shopping\\" button appears it always cuts the game off and loads the browser to their shopping menu even when I ignore the button and hit continue--it always loads their shopping nonsense regardless and then I can't play the game again until I restart the device. For someone who's paid for the game already, they're clearly after more money. Not worth it.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|This show is engrossing, but sort of depressing. The production values and acting are great. An excellent escape into another world is offered by this series of videos... but the net result is my soul is bruised by such an upfront look at the sinfulness and brutality of people.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is awesome.  Full of excitement and always wondering which way you gonna have to turn next so you don't get out.  Very addictive and a fun clean game for family time.  I suggest you get this without a doubt.  I have a 4 year old and he can play better than the rest of us.
0425263991|3.0|I love the series and the vivid, unique world they describe. Unlike most other series which are written as standalones in a certain universe, this one grows stronger and more complex with each book. I admire Ms. Singh for her forward planning as many seeds were planted already in book 2 or 3 and then slowly developed. Kaleb is one of the strongest and yet most enigmatic, so I was looking forward to \\"his\\" book.<br />But it left me with impression that either Ms. Singh changed the editor or she was hard pressed for time and therefore ended the book in a hurry.<br />It starts great with his quarry finally in his hands and realization why he - with all his power - couldn't find her. Her path to herself and her memories is fascinating. Unfortunately the more herself she is, the more boring she becomes. She is just too perfect.<br />Kaleb too is watered down. He is almost changeling in his reaction - with one exception - most of his life his pack consisted of only one another member and even that one was brutally taken away from him. That he remained his humanity at all is almost miraculous. And yet stories from his growing years were one of the best parts of the book.<br />Half way through the book their relationship lost my interest as all that was left was superficial tensions with known resolve. It is also a part where she leaves the house and enters the world, but nevertheless all other characters are hardly mentioned. She meets her father - he hardly speaks a word and is conveniently removed from picture soon afterwords. She meets Sasha, but we find it out just as a footnote, etc.<br />The result is a poorer and less convincing story.<br />From politics point of view, change is momentous, but in fact very little happens.<br />Pure Psy actions only serve to underline how great Kaleb is. Ex-councelors are there in the beginning, but are only footnotes at the end. All other threads are left untouched.<br />Interaction with Aden, Vasic and Valques were well done though.<br /><br />I believe I might enjoy the book more as standalone romantic novel.<br />From series point of view all that is needed are first few chapters and the last two.<br />And eagerly awaiting the next book with wrapping up the story arc.
159463176X|4.0|Interesting character interactions. Very proud to be an American enjoying all its rights and privileges.  Never take freedom for granted.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is beast mode and AWSOME get it and I no you'll love this bananas game and plus you can turn in to a giant minion
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I am a patient man, and I love this game, but without support on a paid game like this, I feel that it is unworthy of a good rating.  This is unacceptable, and needs to be remedied right away.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The book was really captivating. I couldn't put it down. I could see how it would happen in real life. I read the whole book in one day.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|What the title says. If you love speculation, crazy science, good military drama and characters you care about read this series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game I the puzzles were very challenging great for keeping your memory going try to remember each clue
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Loved the first season cant wait for the second. I read the books and wanted to see video. Great series
B0019IB26I|5.0|This album is fun from start to finish. You can feel JMs passion for blues throughout. This is my favorite live album. The versions of the songs played throughout have replaced the album versions that play in my head.
0802473156|5.0|Not much to say about this book that hasn't already been said. great information, even if you have to sort of work around the religious bits (I'm not religious at all) it's still priceless advice. I bought it to read through before considering marriage with the man I am with, along with \\"thing I wish I'd known before we got married\\", also by Gary chapman. Both were very good reads and essential no matter what your relationship situation. I lent both to my father (who already had the strongest marriage of anyone I know with my stepmother) and they even managed to add something extra to their relationship :)
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Great book of wisdom for those who know life is a journey of self discovery<br />I see why it's so famous!
B00DIFARQ6|1.0|u only get two missions. I would give it ZERO stars if I could.<br />I wait for an hour for this to download and all I get is two missions. OUTRAGE. :(
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|A true piece of art.  Beautifully done.  I have become attached to each character.  I could not bear to say good bye to Arthur anymore than Merlin could in letting him go.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is  super fun. If you like subway shufers.  Then you will love this. If I were you get this b it's free.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I couldn't stop reading. Twists and turns up until the end. A father's love and how he copes and defends his own life and that of his family
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We laughed at all our friends that were hooked on Downton Abbey until one rainy day a week ago we decided to check it out. Hooked by episode 2! Writing and filming are great! The characters are engaging, and the scenery and costumes...well, they don't call it Masterpiece Theater for nothing! We blazed through season 2 in about 3 days, and hope to have season 3 finished shortly. And watching via Amazon? LOVE the fast loading speed and the NO Commercials aspect!
B00CH26TL8|2.0|It would be nice if the candy crush saga from King.com is available on KINDLE FIRE HD wishing this game.
0375507256|4.0|This book really tests your vocabulary and French, but it's awesome!  David Mitchell is such a visionary.  Sometimes the tough words were distracting from the story because I would stop to look them up, but I feel smarter now
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Wonderful book! Kept me interested the entire time. It raises many good questions about the law, ethics, and family. Highly recommend it!
B003VANOFY|5.0|No more tripping over cords.  Logitceh has, as always, seemingly thought of everything.  Easy to charge, ear pieces pivot, programmable buttons, auto mute when the mic is put in the &#34;up&#34; position, installation is just plug in, and there are extra features that gamers will appreciate
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was a great series and I can't wait for the 4th installment.  This author does a fantastic job of mixing a little suspense with the romance!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game and play it every opportunity I get. Day and night I'm playing bingo blitz. I've been telling everyone I know to play this game.
006114665X|1.0|Christopher Clark writes what is an unduly long book on the origins of the first World War and yet misses the mark. He writes what is essentially two books.  The first, culminates in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.  This goes into a deep and often meandering summary of events in Serbia and eventually Bosnia which sent the events in motion. The Balkan Wars are given short thrift and the increasing arms race between the major powers is virtually ignored.  So much ink is wasted on minor occurrences which played extremely minor roles<br /><br />All-in-all this is a weak book and really sheds no new light on the era.  I would suggest you not waste your money.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|it sucks Because it is just colorful Balls so it really really really really really sucks sorry But I really Dislike it a lot
1401922732|5.0|I have a very close relationship with this particular Angel Thank you for the prompt and efficient service so that I may enlist the cards to tell me what I need to hear.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is the best. I love it. Trying to get the bananas is fun. The only thing I don't like about it is its rare to get a coin, but everything cost coins.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is shy far one of the best apps ever. So awesome for craft/fitness/cooking/style/beauty inspiration!  Be careful, its highly addicting!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This otherwise fine series which peaked in the 2nd season has beat a strategic retreat back to its comic book origins, building drama on a comic book nemesis, the Governor, rather than on character development and shifting group dynamics. Season two's focus on group loyalties and dangerous illusions is replaced in season 2 by one grim situation after another in which individual differences are reduced to gestures and each character is reduced to a handful of special powers/flaws. It is testimony to the quality of the actors that they are able to keep the characters compelling. The one character that stands-out in this new season is the one who did not appear in the original comic, Darryl. In Season three, the cross-bow shooting loner becomes a worthy alternative to the flawed and increasingly psychopathic leader, Rick Grimes. Unfortunately, the character Herschel, now separated from his ancestral lands, has become just another mere survivor. Anyone who is invested in Season One is already addicted so nothing in a review will have any impact on the likelihood of viewing season two. But in a fictional world so grim, real humanity is essential to keep the series from dissolving into generic media pulp and I fear that it is headed in the wrong direction.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The conclusion to this series was uneven and the ending chapters were disjointed and left more questions than answers.  It was still an interesting read, but not as good as the first two books in my opinion.
1401907725|5.0|I adore reading daily these cards that both enlighten and guide me. Thank you for the prompt and efficient service.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|The information in this book is absolutely spot on. I am a soldier in the U.S. Army and physical fitness is important. For years I've done 2-a-days, cardio with my unit in the morning and the gym in the afternoon. I've tried the tricks and workouts in the magazines with no real results. I can't wait to see the full results of what I've learned from Mr. Matthews.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Not only is the story line interesting, but I love looking at the fashion of the times.  It is very interesting to see how events in history affected people.
0375869026|5.0|Loved this book. I will get my 11 year old to read. Every kid should read it! Cant wait to see what else this author has in store.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|absolutely no point to this game! I guess if you need a game to waste your time then this is for you
1451673442|5.0|I gave this as a gift to a friend who has been sharing quotes on Face Book and really enjoys the book. Thank you for quick and efficient service!
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I really loved it but I do wish it went even deeper into the mechanics of the memory techniques.  The way to memorize poetry and foreign languages wasn't very clear.
B004K00NMG|5.0|Has always been a favorite.  Enjoy watching over and over.  Great family entertainment and fun to watch at sleepovers with friends.
0812992784|3.0|I'm a big fan of Rushdie's books so was looking forward to this one.<br /><br />Overall it was worthwhile but the third person perspective was a bit irritating as were the many details of his dinner parties and life that seemed like he was simply transcribing events from his journal. The editor in me would have loved to strike half of that and be left with the many gems of his experience, relationships and observations.<br /><br />I was impressed with his extreme honesty (and happy I'm not one of his ex-wives who all get a raking - the morale of his story is don't choose life partners at times of extreme stress).<br /><br />I also appreciated that he exposed himself as very human, looking for approval from women, critics, politicians and a British society who never really accept him as one of their own (I have a whole new disdain for the British press after reading this). This vulnerability is something we all experience but rarely admit to.<br /><br />As someone raised in a Fundamentalist faith coming to similar conclusions (that Fundamentalists of all stripes often do more harm than good), this book may well serve as an historical time capsule. Later, when (hopefully) we have evolved into a more secular society, we'll look back at how nonsensical those views were and find it unthinkable that a few ignorant terrorists held artists and the world hostage.

B009NY43NY|3.0|thankfully Ms. Harris decided to write the final Sookie book. she wrapped everything up neatly, a little too neatly in my opinion.<br />overall i loved the entire Sookie series. it was very entertaining, sexy, and imaginative.<br />i look forward to reading the next series by the great Ms. Harris!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I play the computer version all the time, but when I saw this for kindle fire, I wanted it so bad and its awesome!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I enjoyed the DVD, as I like movies depicted in the era. My next purchase will no doubt be<br />Sense and Sensibility, which I liked very much. It was an older VHS so I will want to update<br />my favorites.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really liked this book.  It was very interesting and the way he wrote was very touching.  I'm so glad that he knows that there is a wonderful God.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|The story line is the same, but the action is totality new, this is one that should be shown after the first one ( the black and white one) my wife and grands love this movie, and so do I, I don't understand the reviews that came out stated this was a poor movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is woo addicting. it is fun for all ages and is a great way to pass by time. I totally recommend this game.
B004S3MB2U|1.0|Ah, the new amazon. (Well, they've been changing for the last year or so; no longer the trusting or trustworthy service they used to be). I used to use this app regularly during grocery shopping. Now, all of a sudden, it says I have to be signed in to amazon to use it. Why, thank you, Big Brother Amazon. I know you must have my best interests in mind. It's important that you track my use of the calculator app you so generously offered for free a while back. I guess there are, indeed, strings attached; no free lunch from amazon.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Definitely not as good as the previous Crossfire books.  Nothing really exciting happens...anti-climatic.  Hoping next book in the series will be better.
B008JFUPLC|5.0|After the mediocre Cars 2 and good but underwhelming Brave, I was really worried when I heard that Pixar was going to make yet another sequel/prequel. And a prequel to Monsters Inc of all things. And then the trailers started coming out and they looked awful. But then I started hearing good things about it, so I went in very cautiously optimistic.<br />And I loved it!!  It's the story of how Mike and Sully became friends and how they became a scare team at Monsters Inc.  And it does so in a way that that is very funny and heartfelt. It's one of Pixars funniest movies yet. And it's message is very refreshing in a time where we're told just believe in yourself and you can do anything.<br />I don't think it's as good as films like Up, Ratatouille or Monsters Inc. But It's also better than Cars, Cars 2, Brave and A Bugs Life.<br /><br />Pixar's done it again!
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|No one can have just one you need them all, and if their is another you'll need that to, take a nice day with nothing going on, maybe with someone who thinks like you, set back and enjoy.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Well developed characters and plots. The firm portrayed handles exciting cases and the level of personal drama is perfect. Just enough to keep you interested but not so much the show takes on soap qualities. Doesn't hurt that actors and actresses are also easy to look at!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging and lots of fun.  Requires both logical and creative thinking skills. I think my grandson will love it.  More levels please!
B0016BPWNM|4.0|Cool Movie, video remastered is very good , but the original effects of this movie are not remastered,,,,<br />However, the general result is more 9 points !!!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|This is the best apps for kids. Can't wait to play more and more of this games. I recommend it for young adult and senior people and
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I like Tom Cruise and with action I'am in their, but you know the movie is good when your wife tells you to keep quit, while she looking at your blu-ray, love all the action
147674355X|5.0|i couldnt put the book down, read it in 2 days its adictive, the best book ive ever had. totally recomended
B005JWU5JK|5.0|good read in the tradition of Agatha Christie. I enjoy all of her books.<br />This short story was a very nice afternoon read.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|Elizabeth Banks is hilarious and does the best she can with the material, but \\"watchable\\" is the best this film can aspire to. Lopez is lovely and charming, but still comes off as wooden at times. Not surprising considering the one-dimensional characters she and the rest of the cast were asked to play. For a film that purports to bring comedic honesty to a familiar subject, there was a disappointing lack of anything honest, real or original.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I like the spells on this it really helps me on the game sometimes it freezes on laptop but I still like it.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|I didn't here a lot about this movie, but a movie with Tom Hanks and Holly Berry, it got to be good, I had my grandson over and I was the baby sitter, every time I got into the movie I got called, if you are going to watch the movie, don't let anyone be with you.
0525478817|5.0|great book, i had read it before and i decide it was worth having it to read it over and over again
B00001W9G0|5.0|I have this movie as a VHS, and it is old, but I ordered the dvd and I don't regret it at all, excellent fast shipping, and very good condition. Excellent
B0067R0APK|2.0|Seamless is not a word I would use to describe this app's continuity. It is extremely slow starting even if you have remained in same location, or programmed your zip...every time, and from an HTC<br />&amp; Motorla. Not a problem with settings, either. Maps do not work, and when you do see radar activity and you tap screen, you go to the blank page where you can press enter to replay the last couple hours of blank screen, and you can also zoom in and out in case you have never seen a blank screen before. This looks like a cobbled together app that has potential but first needs to be rewritten by someone who can actually write apps. A waste of time and money. If you include features, they should actually work.
B0031RSBS2|5.0|Escapism at its best. Wealth, power and influence are not enough to protect the perpetrators from Reacher's code of justice
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This Game Is So Awesome And Cute For The Kids , My Kids Love This Game Its Really Fun For Everyone
1451696191|5.0|i loved the movie so i had to read the book and as i expected i loved it. totally recomended
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is the first book I've read about Lincoln.  I have to admire Doris Kearns Goodwin's ability to tell this story so that you feel like you're there in the thick of things as Lincoln tries to sort out the Civil War and keep diverse factions all pulling together in what amounts to an ungodly period in American history.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and if I never read another thing about Lincoln, I feel I came to understand why he is considered by many to be one of the greatest men in US history.  He was charismatic, empathetic and a deep thinker who surrounded himself with former rivals so that he could hear a variety of opinions.  In the end he always followed his gut and did it in a way revered by those who came to work for him and know him.  This is a terrific piece of work by Goodwin.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|How can anyone not love this game? Where else can you play as your own minion? The game has IAP but are not necessary to advance or to have fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I recently saw the latest movie and loved it, and I was super excited when I found it. I love this game!!!
B00DU74U74|5.0|This book was great!  I love that there's a happy ending, some sci-fi books are hopeless.  This is full of life and love
B0000029DD|5.0|Truly one of the best albums of the '90's, it contained some of the loveliest songs that came out in a decade overshadowed by grunge. This album was a breath of fresh air for me. I melted every time I heard Jeff sing, especially when I heard \\"So Real\\" and \\"The Last Goodbye\\". He had such an angelic sound best captured on songs like \\"Lilac Wine\\" and \\"Grace\\". And talk about \\"Halleluiah\\". Sometimes remakes are so well done that they seem to surpass the original. They end up becoming the definitive version. Jeff had one of the most breathtaking voices in recent pop/rock music history. His voice was on par with his late father.(And he wasn't too bad looking either. Remember \\"People\\" Magazine?) It is a shame that Jeff is no longer with us. What a tragic loss. But what an unforgettable debut.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have had the pleasure of reading many wonderful books in my lifetime, but it is rare for a book to haunt me as this one does. Only two books have haunted me prior - Night by Eli Wiesel and A Separate Peace by John Steinbeck.<br />The book follows the story of a young German orphan during the throws of the holocaust, but it has a very unique perspective from the narrator. Zusak succeeds in painting with his words in a way I've never experienced. I literally cried at the beauty of his words! EVERYONE should read this book
0307454568|4.0|Let me start by saying that I did not read the other books in this trilogy, so that may be the cause for some of my confusion.<br /><br />The first hundred pages or so left my head reeling.  There were so many characters that I had no idea who was who.  There were way to many players, many of who were tangential to the final story.  This caused me to almost put the book down.  I'm glad I continued, because the story that emerged was ripping and suspenseful.  The final outcome was expected, but the many twists and turns that it took to get there kept me reading.  However, even after getting well into the book, some of the characters were still fuzzy.  This was unfortunate, because it marred an otherwise really good book.
1400069289|5.0|The book got her on time, was the right book that I ordered, learned a great deal about habits. Didn't take long to start reading. I will order from this supplier in the future. The book was in great condition.
1878424319|1.0|Filled with all kinds of authority claims that don't actually make sense when you think about them (The Toltec were \\"scientists\\", in other words they were knowledge producers in the European Enlightenment tradition? Can't we learn to appreciate cultures without turning them into mirror images of ourselves?)<br /><br />Often sounds like its trying to flatter humanity, but in the awkward way a teenage boy flatters his first love. \\"Oh, you're the stars! No, you're pure light! No you're something even more ethereal than that!\\" But much like lover past their pre-teen days, we should expect more from a philosophy book than to be compared to poetic stock imagery. We should expect a book that says something unique about the human condition, something that challenges us to reconsider our perceived strengths, something that challenges us to be btter than we are.<br /><br />Reject the four platitudes: go read Hume and learn why Assumptions are important, go read Sartre and learn to take the world personally, read Heidegger and learn the importance of stammering in order to create, read Proust and learn the joy of failure. But don't read this, this turns people into Ikea furniture.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Scribblenauts Remix is a cool game cause I could type in whatever I want and whatever I typed in it pops out
B006LSZECO|4.0|The plot had me engaged. Strangely, I was reading for resolve. It never happened. Glad I completed the story but I'm left feeling....baffled.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really like this game. Creative and better than competitors games. Cute storyline and it is really a nice way to waste time when bored.

B00BAYLQI0|5.0|The family love was very endearing and touching. In spite of the tragedy, you can see a lot of people out there helping to find others and caring. This is one love story for the whole family!!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 3-year old loves this and it keeps her occupied for at least half an hour or more.  Highly recommend.
1401324649|3.0|Book started off in a very engaging manner, but somehow lost it's way.  A bit too cloying with all the famous figures he &#34;knew&#34;.  It just got too exaggerated by the end.  Some of it I actually skimmed through because of the tedium.  Ho hum.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I always wanted to watch this show but couldn't. Now having watched up to the 3rd season, I'm Di ally caught up and have enjoyed it immensely.

B008602KQI|4.0|The movie followed the book fairly well.  It dragged in some places, but was enjoyable.  I liked the way the characters seemed to grow and mature.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie.  Lots of action and doesn't insult your intelligence.  Good for both kids and adults alike to enjoy together.  rare these days.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love to hate this game! such fun and a challenge. I have wasted countless hours over the rainy July 4th weekend playing this fun and challenging game! Highly recommend this great time waster!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO FUN! I LOVE IT! THE MINIONS ARE SO CUTE! GREAT! WORTH EVERYTHING! GET IT! IT IS THE BEST!
B0038NN3B4|3.0|Should have had more receipts and charts. That's all folks  too many words required to get the required number of words.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I never read anything by Vince Flynn but after watching coverage of a show discussing his untimely passing and his books, The Last Man was a fast pace story.  The characters were believable and the story relevant to the present time.  I definitely will read more, starting from the beginning. I would highly recommend this book, a good, exciting read.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|great action movie with just enough mystery to keep youy interested, can recommend highly for people that enjoy this type of movie.
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|This film was very entertaining and it was great to learn about one of the best chefs in the world.
B005DJREJS|5.0|As a mom of a teen son who won't watch a 'girly' show, I decided to download myself and I am so glad I did! I haven't laughed so much at a show in a long time. The writers and actors are talented and fresh. The story lines appear to deal with teen issues in today's time., with the understanding the guidance counselor is way out there but so funny! She has a future in comedy! The only disconcerting thing as a mom is the primary character Jenna, lost her virginity at age 15 to a guy she was crushing on before ever dating or knowing him and I think is far too young; however, I am a realist and know unfortunately this happens far too often in today's time. With this moral exception, I love it, and am now on season 2!
B001NFNFIK|5.0|I loved this movie from start to finish. Good story, good acting. I don't write long reviews, just watch it. For the price, you can't go wrong!
0770437400|5.0|I finished reading World War Z last week and i have to say it is a very good book. As with any book or movie there were a few things that i didn't like but overall it is an impressive piece of fiction writing.<br /><br />A basic summary of this book is: The Great Zombie War has officially been over for roughly 10 years and the narrator (whom is never named)is writing this oral account of the war consisting of these interviews he conducted with many other survivors ranging from military to civilians from all across the globe. This piece of writing was written by the narrator to preserve these stories so future generations can know more about the people and not just the cold hard statistics of the war.<br /><br />Max does a great job writing this book, he clearly did extensive research while writing this book. His writing itself is very good and he clearly thought through each and every interview and does a good job at it giving a complex interview that makes it seem more realistic and more like what you would expect in life. Because in real life when things go wrong its rarely a simple A to B situation. Max did a great job at really portraying the characters personalities and really making you understand exactly what type of person the narrator is speaking to. One of the most impressive things is his slow build up to the Zombie War. His way of writing builds the anticipation and does so amazingly.<br /><br />Overall this is a great book, its very interesting and was written in a very different and interesting way. There are really no serious downsides to this book. My only complaint is some of the interviews are a little boring, but most are very interesting and contain a little piece of the overall story and then the rest of it is just stuff that the person experienced.<br /><br />All said and done this book is great. It is a well written horror thrill ride that takes you into the deepest of mankind's fears....ZOMBIES!!! I give this book 5 out of 5 stars it is wellworth reading and adding to your book collection.
0786868724|5.0|His stories of real people and their influence in his life have also influenced the lives of others - especially mine.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I could not get enough of this show.  The 1st season is absolutely great.  The story is interesting (no high school drama), the music is amazing, fast paced.  Watched every episode 3 or 4 times.<br /><br />The second season was not the same, at least for me.
B003ZZAXNG|1.0|I honestly believe if you remove \\"former Pink Floyd member\\" that this album would get no better than an average rating.  I had heard so many positive comments about this \\"cult\\" album, but I went into this hoping for something a bit more diagonal/hallucinatory.  The problem is the lyrics and Syd's vocal style are idiosyncratic, but the most important ingredient, the music, is not.  The album is overwhelmingly acoustic and disappointingly linear; the chord playing has a sameness throughout.  As a whole the album feels like it is trying way to hard to be quirky for the sake of being quirky, and it comes across as even tuneless dare I say.  Whatever comparisons to Roger Waters I just am not seeing here.  I have already purchased \\"Opel\\", but this time I am going in with no expectations.  Very disappointing.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I love to use this app when I'm having a difficult time falling asleep.  There are many different sound options and one is sure to suit your needs!
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|Khaled Hosseini followed up his previous great novels with this beauty. It's a great read, excellent character development and the intertwining of the lives of the characters was well thought out. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love these books  Crossfire is an amazing book and Sylvia Day is an amazing author I can't wait for the other book to come out I will differently be buying that book also.. this series is a must read.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I bout this app an my kindle and I could not stop playing it it was so fun I told all my friends and they loved it to if you like dragons this is the game for you
B00AVFO41K|5.0|I had this game on a computer several years ago, so, in spite of all the negative reviews I got the free app. I've glad I did. Just start at the easy level and keep playing till you figure it out.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The ultimate release for this blockbuster - all the extras we didn't get in the UK plus it has the proper title AND is uncut.  Highly recommended!
1781162646|5.0|Among the best of Stephen Kings later novels. As always the characters are more than just 2 dimentional. The prompt keeps saying 2 more words when I've said all I've got to say.  Happy now?
B000MDDSB8|5.0|Thought the movie was good, actually watched the movie more for the actors than the actual movie. Fine young men DAMN!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|very good and very quick reading. Holds your interest till the very end. I recommend this book to all Sylvia Day readers
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Bought this as its only one of very few musicals I like.  Picture and sound are a vast improvement compared to the old DVDs (retains the original look of the film e.g. diffused light, light grain). Has a good range of extras, nice digibook and plays on Region B players.
1451627297|5.0|Almost, but not quite, as good as the expanded edition of The Stand.  That makes it one of my top 5 favorite Stephen King books.<br />I just wish he had been kinder to Texas.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Why won't it update on kindle fire? I updated it just fine on my iPad but not on kindle. My son really loves to play this game and I have spent way too much money to have to start over!!! FIX IT NOW!!!

B007I1TFK0|4.0|Great picture and sound - can't fault the blu ray's reproduction of the film's look, soundtrack but could do better with the extras.  Could have had a commentary by Alan Parker, more music videos, publicity material, galleries, detailed featurettes.  Don't get me wrong - the behind the scenes doc, teaser trailer and music video are good....just remember there being a lot more publicity about the making of the film which could have made this a better release.
0345803485|4.0|I LIKE THIS BOOK!  I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. I ORDERED PART 2 BUT GOT PART 3 INSTEAD, BY ACCIDENT, AND NOW I AM ABOUT TO ORDER PART 2. GREAT READ.
0062059963|5.0|I got this book after reading The Selection for a book club I am leading at the school I teach at.  The first book made me want to know what happened so I got The Elite.  The book is an easy, very interesting read.  Great for high school aged girls!
030746363X|4.0|I've just borrowed this book from a friend to read the chapters applicable to me and give it a shot, but I also thought I'd check out reviews here to see what others thought. My friend (also a woman) was a big fan and, although petite and athletic already, lost 7 lbs. over the course of about 30 days. That sounded great, but I wanted more reviews. I should also point out that I have read the 98 pages Ferriss recommends to me in the intro based on my goals (Slow Carb Diet I & II, Basics, etc.) and am in my first week of following the principles he outlines.<br /><br />Having said that, I am rather taken aback by the amount of people (particularly women) who have given outright negative reviews and denounced the book on behalf of everybody.  Just because it didn't work for you (or you don't think it will work for you) doesn't mean that it should be tossed aside as utterly useless for all people. I don't know yet if it will work for me and I certainly recognize the similarity of his principles to those in the Paleo diet and South Beach Diet.  However, he makes it simple, entertaining, and most of all gives you a virtually fail-proof way of motivation (an element missing from most other methods which rely solely on your ability to motivate yourself through simply wanting to see change...great! but that doesn't work for the majority of us, obviously!!).<br /><br />One thing that I wish he did include, and I think it would help reduce the naysayers, is a way to see whether these levels of protein will work for you.  There are definitely different ways that people metabolize food and, lucky for me when implementing the 4HB methods, I happen to be a protein type. I crave salt, not sugar, have no problem giving up fruit and sugar, and my body responds extremely poorly when I don't get high levels of protein in my meals (for example, I experience more crashes in energy, have significantly higher cravings, am constantly hungry, and just generally feel kind of crappy with low energy for the majority of my day). On the other hand, I have friends who are the opposite and actually have better body response to higher levels of healthy carbs like steel cut oatmeal, quinoa, barley, etc. and less protein. I highly doubt that this book would work as well for them.<br /><br />Bottom line, this book is entertaining, interesting, provides key ways to motivate yourself if you are like the majority of Americans (and let's not get into a discussion judging our American society...sure, change needs to happen, but that's not what this book is about.  This book was obviously and smartly written to address the reality of our current society vs. trying in vain to address a culture that simply doesn't exist for the majority of us and therefore won't produce success for the majority of us), and perhaps most importantly, gives you simple, fast ways to implement change without the opportunity to make excuses.  Take it or leave it.

B00AVFO41K|4.0|no in app directions not a problem. game is intuitive, requires thought. hard to plan moves because there's no warning where the next ball will be placed. but special balls make game play possible longer.  will keep on my kindle fire for a while.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|A truly original story told in such a compelling and beautiful way that it stays with you long after you put it down.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|The movie is amazing, watch it.<br /><br />I'm here to review Amazon's Instant Streaming. I 1 click purchased the rental, and was watching the movie the next moment. When they say instant they aren't kidding.<br /><br />During the movie my internet was interrupted, which I believe was my modem and service providers fault. Reloaded the screen, and everything was fine.<br /><br />The next day I saw an e-mail from Amazon saying that they noticed the stream was interrupted, they refunded the rental (without me asking), and apologized. These kind of business practices are rare these days, and I cannot explain how amazed I was. I didn't write them or contact them in any way, but they refunded the rental for a minor inconvenience, which I don't even think was their fault. I'd give 6 stars if I could.
B0038TWHP6|5.0|The sadness of the Irish oppression and the illconcieved need of the British empire to control it's assets. Yet another must see!

B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I love Bruce. Willis. He puts the. A in action just the right length and keeps your attention until the end. He is a classic and should be an action figure.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The only reason I did not give five stars is because it ended quicker than I expected. It was refreshing to play something that wasn't mindless on my kindle.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much its a blast to play. I love how you can do stuff to earn achievements overall wonderful app
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|The cast was great especially Tom Hanks. It was way too long however. It was difficult to follow much of the time. It has a message which causes you to think about it long after the movie is over. A good film to watch alone with no interuprions on a rainy day with your phone turned off.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|It was a good suspenseful read, but not quite as good a story as Atonement.  &#34;Gone Girl&#34; in the other direction.

B00AVFO41K|3.0|The free app of the day for July 10, 2013 is CSG Crazy Ball Power Lines Match5 from CodingCake.<br /><br />I know most are going to be wondering why I am giving this 3 stars rather than the one star it probably deserves.  But I will get to that later in the review.<br /><br />There are a lot of negatives about this one:<br /><br />1.  A terrible and somewhat confusing name for this game.  Keep it short and memorable.  Something like Marble Chains would have been a much better title than the one the app maker used.<br /><br />2.  A lack of a training tutorial mode.  You can't expect us to understand the game without any instructions.  I will give the instructions below to those who are completely confused by this game.<br /><br />3.  A lack of features for a paying game.  You got to add features to an app you are going to charge for or people will feel ripped off when they realize that the quality of this app feels like a free app.<br /><br />4.  Like I mentioned above, the overall quality of this app feels like one you would expect to get for free.  There are no hint features, list of accomplishments, high score tables, etc.  This is a bare bones release.<br /><br />5.  Requires too many permissions for a simple game that doesn't require online access to play at all.  Ordinarily I don't mention permissions in my reviews but by now publishers who participate in the Free App of The Day program by Amazon should KNOW and EXPECT to get bad reviews for permissions that some are going to find totally unnecessary.<br /><br />6.  Putting a \\"Rate Me\\" option on the main menu.  That is asking for bad reviews on Amazon every time.<br /><br />Now here is why I am giving this game 3 stars out of 5:  The game is actually playable.  Here is how you play it.  The object of the game is to get 5 marbles of the same color in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  Each turn you can move a marble anywhere on the board as long as there are no marbles in the path (horizontally, vertically, or a combo of the both of them but not diagonally) of the spot you want to move the marble in. Then more marbles will appear.  You keep moving marbles around until the game ends when there are no more free open spaces.<br /><br />The marbles with different color wedges are wild marbles meaning they can be any color you want.  The marbles with arrows will remove all of the marbles in that row or column directly to the side of the arrowhead.<br /><br />It is actually an OK game once you know the rules.<br /><br />Because the app maker seems to be rather naive and apparently hasn't done their homework on what makes an app worthy of being a paid app and worthy of getting good reviews, I am going to give them a little slack this time and give them 3 stars out of the 5 stars possible since they do have a game concept that if greatly improved would be actually worth paying for.
B0089LOG02|5.0|THIS WAS TERRIBLY SAD,BUT IT WAS EDUCATIONAL.THIS COULD BE USED IN A HIGH SCHOOL OR JUNIOR COLLEGE LITERATURE OR HISTORY CLASS.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun to play<br />some levels are challenging. makes you use your creative thinking skills. some solutions are tricky. more levels will be fun.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the story line and the characters.  Filled with adventure.  Always leaves you hanging on for the next episode.  Highly recommend.
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|The Amazon App Store free paid app of the day for July 9, 2013 is Kings Can Fly from Firedroid.<br /><br />This is a game where you have to maneuver a group of hot air type blimps between two places in a 3D environment by stragetically placing fans to change the direction in order to get the blimps to the destination point without crashing into something.<br /><br />This was a hard one for me to decide whether to give it 3 stars or 4 stars out of the 5 stars since I wanted to give it 3.5 stars but that isn't an option.<br /><br />I decided to go with the lower 3 star rating for the following reasons:<br /><br />The story movie at the beginning was rather short and didn't make much sense and felt completely uninspired.<br /><br />While the 3D environment looks OK, I didn't like the interface used to place the fans.  It seemed somewhat more time consuming to place the fans in the spots I wanted to place them than what it should have been.<br /><br />And when you finally set the blimp things in motion to test the flight path you made, it seems rather boring watching them go from point A to point B.<br /><br />So while the game is somewhat challenging, the reward at the end just doesn't seem worth it.<br /><br />So I am giving this game 3 stars out of 5 stars mainly for a lack of inspiration by the game developer to keep it interesting.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|the opening scene kinda just drops you into the movie, Was okay nothing too rememberable.  I wouldn't recommend to buy it.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I read when ever I could, breaks at work, any where. This book keeps you on your toes, trying to unwrap the mystery yourself and the ending has you anxiously waiting for the next book. just loved it!!
B005V20JKI|1.0|I have never had trouble getting apps to run on my phone but this one would never work.  It would just load and load and load......
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really love this app, you can choose one, or a few different sounds to listen to together, so anyone that does not like and/or are not able to fall asleep with silence, there are plenty of options that you would undoubtedly find something that is most soothing for specifically you.
6304493681|5.0|quite the journey, an imaginative frolic in a future world<br /><br />a great addition to your collection<br /><br />soundtrack is good too
B000FA675C|5.0|This was a 're read for me and I enjoyed it so much more this time.  WAS IT, I have aged, mellowed, or what?  I do not have a clue but I do know that this time around was so much more interesting, exciting and satisfying!  Dan Brown has the knack to bring more than just words to a novel, he has heart.  It's that heart that brings a book alive for us too enjoy.  I hope you will take the time that God gave us, to re read the ones you really enjoyed, I'll bet you will find as I have they are even better than they were the first time....ENJOY!
B003XYERRM|5.0|I had a hard time believing Penman's depiction of Richard III since I was so well acquainted with Shakespeare's play about the same Medieval king,So I welcomed the last chapter and her explanation at the end reporting on how the next king, Henry Tudor, and his balladeers and chroniclers, in order to justify the Tudor monarchy, rewrote history by painting Richard so black and twisted, literally. I guess the truth is somewhere between Penman and Shakespeare and his sources. When one reads historical fiction, there is always a question as to what in the story is history and what is fiction. Not knowing for sure the true history, I can vouch for the good fiction. Richard is presented as a complex and dynamic character - Complex in that he has depth with very good principles and yet let's himself, due to the exigencies of his kingship, corrupt those principles somewhat. Dynamic in that Richard grows, changes and morphs into someone at the end that is totally different than when he was young. I find it admirable that Penman chose to make him moral in his relations with women, ie. one wife, and totally true to her. Fiction? I hope not! What was way, way confusing were the many Edwards, Richards (Dickons), Henrys, Annes, etc. I frankly just gave up trying to figure out who we were talking about sometimes. Now that is true to family history where older generations name their children and grandchildren after themselves. I hated the way women were treated as royal pawns for political purposes. And this book is just one more testament to the fact that Kings and Queens are a very bad idea for the common people. &#34;Absolute power corrupts absolutely&#34; applies here, not only the country, government and laws, the elite and commoners, but also the very individuals who wield absolute power. The theme of loyalty versus treason were repeated so often it became predictable. No foreshadowing needed. This is a very long book, but very good. I recommend it to anyone interested in thistime (1400s) and the end of the War of the Roses with York winning, the end of the Plantagenents, and start of the Tudors
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I have been using the Full Facebook app for about a month and mostly it is ok, but it is difficult to navigate at times, gets stuck on a page and sometimes has to be closed out and reopened.  Also, it tries to let you tag people (highlight their name) when you are posting about a friend but it will not work correctly, it freezes up and sometimes will delete what you wrote and you have to start over. Lastly, if you stop to read someone's newsfeed comments it starts you back all the way at the beginning of the newsfeed so a not of scrolling to get back to where you were.  It does allow you to do more than the regular facebook login method but still needs some work.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable works great, and is 5 feet long, which is much longer than the typical cellphone cable, or other device that comes with a micro-USB connector. I will be buying more for my other devices. These people are great too, my first shipment got lost, and they helped out in the best way. Thanks!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Interesting game. I have not gotten very far yet. I don't like having to pay money to get all the extras the game has to offer though.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Amazing game. Recommend for mmorg fans. Closest game to LoL (League of Legends). Must play. Easily on  o  th  Best free to play game for kindlefire.
B007Y36K46|5.0|Such an amazing journey JC makes.  Lots of double meaning lines of dialogue.  Hints at nature of reality, human evolution, with reference to Christian and Egyptian cultural in script. This one is a must see, everyone will enjoy it, from the kiddos, to the older guys and gals.
B004G0SJU8|4.0|This is a great love story, but it takes a little time for the movie to get going. Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan are both really good in this movie.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|I tried and to watch it 2 times and well all the screaming and yelling and the only funny parts were the ones they showed for the preview, I should have listened to my brother he said it stunk!  And winning award is a clear thing that it is BAD~!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|found this to be ok  not as good as the first 2 in the series would not recommend it  sorry
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I bought this to add to my kindle fire for my wife to be able to set up graphs and charts for her to take to the DR. Office with her.  She has diabetes and has to monitor her blood sugar. The only problem with the program is that it does not give clear enough instuction on how to set up files on the Kindle or download files from a computer onto the kindle.  I know it can be done I just Haven't figured out how just yet.  Is there some instructions that would help to set files on the Excell side of the Office Program.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|tons of bugs, and you can't play between devices that sucks. but the app is amazing anyway.<br />I will love to play in my kindle fire and iphone the characters please
B009FZHYKU|5.0|nothing to say But Great TV!  Can't wait till next year and see who survey's!  Love all the people in show!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When I got this game I thought that it was going to be boring , but,it turned out to be fun and not even boring
B00881VLCE|3.0|Love the puzzles but every time I buy a set of puzzles  and then I shut off my kindle  when I turn it on again all the puzzles I bought are gone they may not be expensive but still I can't afford to buy them  every day  for my grandson
034580404X|5.0|nice product, fast shipment exactly what I was looking as this was a gift for a very special person that love those books
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game look forward to more food being added. Posted on the airplane with my daughter and kept her mind off her fear of flying
B00C32REYI|5.0|I love this entire album and was a introduced to this guy by my daughter. This is my mood relaxing day music!!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game is my favorite thing on the hole entire world:)  : ) : )<br />I love the gracias and the tasks that you have to complete to get more points or gems is so cool and fun

B004M3H17Q|5.0|I love this entire album and was a introduced to this guy by my daughter. This is my mood relaxing day music!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|I missed this series until Season 3 came out in June. All I can say is so glad Amazon has on prime instant video! I watched Seasons 1&2 over the course of a single weekend. Great story, characters, plot and effects.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|This game has terrible graphics, the controller works really bad, the game glitches all the time, and finally the playing field is way too small you can see all the notes from spawn,  bad game!!!!!
B00003CXA2|5.0|Can't go wrong with Forest and Bubba. Easy way to spend a lazy afternoon or evening at home with a good movie
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I love this movie, and it doesn't ruin the first! AWESOME :) Have watched it over and over. I do have to say it is much better in 3D.
1416594795|4.0|Recently I became interested in the topic of evolution due to all of the news about intelligent design versus evolution in public education. This book obviously takes a strong position and will convince most logical thinkers which is the clear winner. I found some parts of the book hard to follow (proteins) but for the most part everything was easily explained and very logically thought out. In particular I enjoyed the first chapter, and the chapter on embryology.<br /><br />Great book I would recommend it.
B000286RKW|5.0|I love this movie, there is no scratches that I see on the discs. Only thing that bothers me is the case falls apart. lol
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Love this movie. It seems a little more realistic now after being to Rome twice and seeing where such events took place.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Love it wanted more got hooked after the first episode. Saw only 5 episodes first and wanted more soo I bought the rest.  Kevin Bacon is awesome as not soo perfect hero but definitely his heart in the right place. One likes him due to his genuine human nature.  Joe is very believable as the bad guy in a Manson kind of way, he make us hate him and the blinding influence over the others. This show kept me entertained at the edge if my seat as I kept watching I wanted more.
B007TXS56W|4.0|This was purchased as a gift for my son so the following are his comments: &#34;Obviously not Holy Mountain but solid; recommended.&#34;
B00BAHKQW4|3.0|Its not great either... it seemed addicting at first but quickly became sorta repetitive. Moving around became a chore and made me dizzy... had to open the map up way to often.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|Another great movie for the movie collection. Cant go wrong with the movies you grew up watching as a kid.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I like the subscription option and how it picks up key words in search. My little girl say it is easy to understand and to navigate.
1938469003|5.0|I bought this book for our son so the following is his opinion: &#34;Excellent! Serves as both a history book and a brewing guide.&#34;
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have played these games only on Xbox and Playstation 3 until now. Making choices and gameplay in general is just easier and more fluid with a touch screen. I will always buy for the tablet from now on.
B000065V42|5.0|Another great movie for the movie collection. Cant go wrong with the movies you grew up watching as a kid.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I highly recommend it. It is a good family movie that I think all would enjoy watching, so be sure and see it!
B005TBN3EU|1.0|I could not even finish this movie.  I thought it would be funny but turned out to be a big disappointment.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story is an animated but sophisticated app for Kindle Fire. I enjoy playing this game because the game is free but entertaining.  I truly think the creators understood what they were doing.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The complete saga on Blu-Ray doesn't disappoint.  First off, you get the movies on Blu-ray.  So much better than the dvd versions, which is tough to say normally, but it is.  Secondly, the box contains some pretty sweet art which was an unexpected surprise.  Last, even the bonus disc's are Blu-ray, while not important, is a nice little bonus.  All-in-all a great product.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The tensions between the two main characters carries the story.  Castle's wit and talent are pleasing to watch unfold.  In many day-to-day situations, he is self-centered and immature.  But when the situation is dangerous and lives are on the line, his responses are fascinating--brain power over violence and evil.  Castle's mother, herself a drama queen, comes through with sage advice and counsel at the right moment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app lots of fun, graphics are great. Recommend this to everyone. Good job everyone. Will continue to play. Can't wait to get further
B00275EHJG|2.0|Half way through the movie it started skipping and wouldn't play. Froze and couldn't get it to work again... Disappointing.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This CD is wonderful!  I thought the Lopez duet was just a little<br />lacking (on her part) but I don't mind it.  Bocelli's  is a tough voice<br />to have a musical conversation with for anyone.  Great listening!
B0037EAJAC|5.0|This masterpiece by Kurosawa tells a story we all are familiar with, but in such a way as to make you love that story as if you were watching it for the very first time. The cinematography, the vibrant colors all contribute to one of cinema's finest achievements.
B00B9366VO|5.0|The rich history of one small ramshackle business making a big gamble on a new technology and it paying off with the best sounding records in the business. This was informative and entertaining. As a Dave Grohl fan, I couldn't wait to see it. I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon Instant. If you collect records, you definitely must see this.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I find this app every bit as good for catching up on BBC news as the full website with an even cleaner interface.  For news junkies I'd say this is a must have app.  Very responsive and quick on WiFi.
1483934772|5.0|This is an ethereal read. It is a fantastical story that focuses on an 18 year old girl/woman who is on a magical quest to discover the gifts that she inherited from her Indian ancestors.<br /><br />The story reminded me of when I was young and the possibilities were endless. Characters shape shift into wolves and other godly animals.<br /><br />What will draw readers into this novel, is the love story. We all in search of love and the main character is no different. She is young, curious and moved by her heart which is pure.<br /><br />This was a refreshing read. It brought me back to my childhood when I was open to all possibilities.<br /><br />Sherly is a gifted writer who captures the wonder of life through tales of trials, magic, and love.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book should be mandatory in high school.  Makes your mind work on many ethical medical issues. This is a must read.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, fantastic puzzles, great graphics! Finished in about 90 mins, though. Can't wait for another from this company. Thanks!
B00AVFO41K|2.0|1. When I pressed rate, it brought me to the wrong app.<br /><br />2. I don't get how it works.<br /><br />3. It makes crazy noises.<br /><br />If you are absolutely crazy, and has nothing to do in your life, go ahead.
B007SGM084|5.0|such a great book so in love with it story!!! Ana and Christians love is amazing!! It makes you want a man like Christian Grey!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat most of the way through.  Again, barely able to put it down once I got started on it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We recurred this quickly and the movies are in great condition.<br />It's fun to watch this as a family :)
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|no problem installing works great yes you're using the desktop<br />also comes in handy when downloading documents from your email
B0066W1AZK|5.0|My kids and I love to play Chess together but when we can't we practice our skills with this app.  Computer skill is adjustable and the undo button helps my kids learn in the moment.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books!  Not at all what I expected but once I got started, I had to finish all of them.  So happy there was a happy ending.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|And kept it for me. Fun, it's just very easy to break your neck. I think I just being too timid with the accelerator.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Great little app for every day calculations.  The interface is easy to get used to, and at times you almost try to find a chance to use it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|When you have all of the marvel super heroes in one movie, what's not to love? I give it a GFM rating, good-Freaken-movie!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best books I've read in quite some time.  Definately a notch above what I usually read.  However, not what I expected at all.  Very uncomfortable at times, but riveting.
1592400876|5.0|This book is a joy! With today's use of technology, the internet, social networks and email have allowed many non-writers to write. Hence, writer, Lynn Truss does not give the everyday checklist or workbook to punctuation, she offers poignant literary and historical references of punctuation gone wrong! This book is an easy read with the voice of a story that can capture anyone that does not pay much attention to the detail of punctuation.
B00338QELU|4.0|Henning did very well with this novel to span across US, Sweden, Africa and China and across 100+ years and STILL keep it a riveting read which could be followed without my brain hurting.  Impressive story-telling.<br />I am a fan of the Wallander series and am now enjoying his other books.<br />I visited China whilst reading this and it did give me a &#34;you are being watched&#34; feeling!!
B0052UYJDC|5.0|One woman's take on dealing with clutter and getting rid of it in order to<br />adapt a minimalist lifestyle.  She gives you excellent reasons to free<br />yourself from stuff and live a more easier life.  She talks about purging<br />items and rooms in each chapter.  Why worry about stuff you don't need or<br />use?  Must read!  Contains helpful tips.  This is the first book on dealing<br />with clutter that I read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was entertaining.  It had a lot of twists and turns that were unexpected.  Definately a good, easy read.
B000NQRE0K|4.0|It was interesting to see this for the first time now, rather than when it came out and was all the rage. Early European Tribalism, Hollywood style. Also interesting to see Mel Gibson when he was young, and then see him play similar warrior characters in Patriot and We Were Young. He is convincing as a soldier on the edge of going berserk. As an actor, he knows how to tap the madness that might be a part of his actual personality.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Too long for such a stupid ending. You spend all that time reading to be totally disappointed at the end. I don't usually share my feelings about books....but I spent a lot of time on this book.....to be disappointed in the end.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I didn't have very high hopes when I started this. I was expecting a twilight knockoff or something, but was pleasantly surprised. Couldn't put it down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|one of the best shows out there. drama to the max. cannot wait until the next season and to see the progression of the characters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game, alot of fun. Only problem is I finished it in one day. Need more than 10 levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its really good but it kinda lags at some times. on the other hand it is really like subway suffers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katness is quickly becoming one of my all time favorite characters. I could read this over and over again. It's great.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY ITS JUST EASIER THAN FINDING EBAY ON THE WEB. WITH THE APP YOU CAN GO STRAIGHT TO IT.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Great series. HD is like a movie theater in your living room.  Wish bonus material had been longer instead of the average 3m per category as there is a lot of repetition this way.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|They've out done themselves!!! This may be their best album yet! It's great on all levels and I'm really enjoying it!
B008P3SPVU|5.0|we reallyt enjoyed this movie.....nice and not vulgar...thanks we all need to watch more of these kinds of movies etc
B009UX2YAC|5.0|MY CHILDERN GOT THIS GAME AND THEY ARE REALLY GOOD AT IT. HAS ALOT OF HAND EYE COORDINATION. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME.
B00C0W08XK|3.0|It's Sudoku, so it's fun.  However, the display is somewhat busy.  Having the 3 x 3 blocks outlined in bold lines would make it easier to break up the 9 x 9 grid.  Also, particularly towards the end of the game, it would be nice to be able to pick a number and enter it into multiple blocks without having to select the number every time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging, but not too hard to progress. I like that the whole room can be searched and that some rooms have multiple sides.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Fun old school hack and slash. Very easy to under stand and play. Graphics are some of the best I've seen. Great time killer.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I love this book series so much. But there were just so many shocking moments with in the book that sometimes I would stay up till two in the morning just to finish a chapter. I love this book and I am hooked.
1439156816|5.0|This is a fantastic book, that's part lesson , part memoir, and part road to recovery.<br /><br />The memoir is filled with great stories of how he faced challenges when first starting out, to how he met his wife, anecdotes about how he wrote some his novels. It reads very fast jumping through time, I could read a hundred more of these little chapters.<br /><br />The lesson is a good one and not scolding session.  I can see myself pulling this out when I get stuck or seek advise. I loved the way he approached the lesson saying this is what works for me it might work for you it might not, and he occasionally talks dirty to keep you interest, that's what I needed in high school.<br /><br />Even the road to recovery is interesting, I liked how he talked to the guy who hit him and possibly killed him.  it is  a priceless conversation.<br /><br />I think every writer should read this to see if it applies to them maybe it doesn't maybe it does it's pretty short for a King novel. You should check it out.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Can't get the app to work at all anymore! Tried everything! Oh well, guess I will just read books! :-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is a must have=D when I got it I was thinking it was not going to be as good as subway surfers but it is better so u should get this
B009HNDCC4|5.0|So much fun for the whole family!  Funnier than Archie and Edith,  Solid acting.  Great writing.  We always love it!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It is very helpful having to be able to see the state your battery is in. I guess it comes in part from being able to see the amount of charge left in your cell phone. It helps you visualize better.
B003XUKVXK|5.0|this gig, recorded live, brings in a lot of Blues hands that know their way around the place.  KWS was sicker than a dog, but the show has to go on, and in spite of his ill, PUT OUT perhaps one of the best, if not the best renditions of his sort of blues and style, among fellow world-renowned top musicians!!!  This is a CD that every blues afficionado should get!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because it has missions and the little people are so cute there funny little people I also love this game because it is a challenge the challenges are kind if hard but not really
B00B5AIB50|5.0|I have probably watched every Karajan documentary that's been released on VHS and DVD over the last 25 years (\\"Karajan in Salzburg\\", \\"Karajan, or Beauty as I see it\\", \\"Karajan: Maestro for the Screen\\", etc.)  This is one of the best, due almost entirely to the loads of rare footage I'd never seen before.  The focus is on Karajan as a recording artist in the last 20 years of his career.  So there are the requisite interviews with Anne-Sophie Mutter, Brigitte Fassbaender, and others.  No terribly fresh or arresting points are made, but the rehearsal sequences and snippets from live performances and the footage of Karajan in the recording control room are truly invaluable.  You get to see a side of him that is all too rarely displayed in the more glamorized and carefully staged stock footage.  The snippets of him coaching Thomas Stewart as the Wanderer in Siegfried, or yukking it up in the control room with Michael Glotz and the sound engineers, or those from the live performance of Mahler's 5th (complete with his post-performance exit to the wings were he signs autographs for fans in between bows), for example, are fascinating to watch.  Much attention is given to Karajan's relationships with his producers and sound engineers and his attempts to make his recordings reflect the orchestral sound he heard at the podium, rather than as one might hear it as an audience member sitting in the concert hall.  Again, for admirers of Karajan and his recorded legacy (even if you have mixed feelings about them, as I often do) this is incredibly engrossing documentary.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|Liked the romance  mixed with the action in a seamless mix of page turning good reading.  What's not to like about Teacher and his sense of fairness in the muddled world of fighting political wars driven by profits and the state contracts politicians can justify in their morally bankrupt rationalizations!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Buy this game it an Awsome game. Where you build you own city!!!! I play the game everyday in the car, house, outside, Anywhere so anyways Buy this game!! I ENJOY THIS GAME SO MUCH
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|a cool fun game that beats temple run to the punch. temple run 3 the bar has been raised!! with so many different aspects to the game you are bound to make a mistake!!
1451695195|2.0|As a scientist, I actually have an open mind regarding the two oldest standing questions that have been asked since the dawn of humanity: is there a God and is there an afterlife?<br /><br />I am a physicist, and the one lesson that Relativity and Quantum Mechanics show is that the universe has a much richer structure than was assumed based on Newtonian physics.  I applaud Alexander for mentioning such in his book.  For example, in his description of heaven, he notes how time is different... in essence he was \\"everywhen\\".  This is consistent with the view of time as the 4th dimension and a being unconstrained by the 2nd Law of thermodynamics (entropy) which imposes a linearity of \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" in our experience of time.  Freed from this, one could experience time like space:  the \\"present\\" would be your location in time, but you could experience also all around you the past and future.<br /><br />Similarly, the possible role that consciousness plays in the physical world as indicated by quantum mechanics has been recognized for over 70 years now; and without a definite resolution.  See for example Schroedinger's book, \\"Mind and Matter\\", or the late John Wheeler's pronouncement that the is \\"is a participatory universe\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, Alexander falls short in terms of how the book is presented as a \\"proof\\";  it does not add to the above literature on the deeper structure of reality.  Here are some my objections to his case:<br /><br />1) His heaven is remarkably anthropomorphic. Trees, waterfalls, butterflies, and puffy clouds??  Really? A bit cliched wouldn't you say. He mentions the vastness of the universe and other beings.  So my question is, to use a science fiction example, if you were from Vulcan or Klingon, would this be your idea of heaven?<br /><br />2) Who gets to experience this heaven?  The apes differ from us by only a few percent and certainly process information through their neocortex and are conscious beings.  Do they get to heaven?  Anyone who lives with a dog knows they are conscious and love; the coin of the realm in Alexander's heaven.  Do they get in?  Obviously trees get into heaven, but do mosquitoes?<br /><br />3) I read with great interest his Appendix B.  I understand when writing for a general audience the need to limit technical details, so I expected in the appendix to find the real meat of his argument of proof.  Sadly, there is none there.  He sets up a series of straw men and then knocks them down by only two arguments: \\"My experience was so rich that the physical trigger could not have worked.\\" and if the trigger could have a possibility of working, then he resorts to \\"My neocortex was shut down\\".  He presents no hard medical evidence of his neocortex being totally non-functional.  He cites none of his actual medical tests in these arguments.  Also, the neocortex consists of billions of neurons.  None of these tests insure that every single one of these neurons were no longer firing.  I find it difficult to believe that there was absolutely zero activity yet somehow he makes a full recovery.<br /><br />4) There is one sentence where he mentions his past use of LSD.  LSD use results in flashbacks even years later.  Could the infections have simply caused such a flashback?  Of course, he would respond that his neocortex was shutdown, but as I mentioned before, he gives no hard evidence that this was measured in any definitive way.<br /><br />I was hoping for a much more technical, discussion of the NDE along with much more rigorous data.... after all that is how he is marketing the book.<br /><br />Finally, I would like nothing more than to believe his story.  NDE's could be another piece of data that contribute to our knowledge of the structure of reality.  This book does not do the case justice.Anyone who lives with a dog knows they are conscious and love; the coin of the realm in Alexander's heaven.  Do they get in?

B007VYAJAE|5.0|Loved the film from beginning to end. First of, I adore EVERYTHING about the late great Bob Marley, so I truly enjoyed the docu/film. I learnt so many new stuff I didn't even know about him and also loved the interviews from different people who had the opportunity of knowing him through out is life. The film was picture perfect, real, and just the right length of time. Not one doll moment!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|i bought this movie as a gift for my husband who is a sherlock holmes fan.  we think robert downey jr. is a great sherlock holmes.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I love this music. It is great to clean the house and run with. Very relaxing yet motivating. I am a total fan
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Really good book to make you aware of the limitations you impose on yourself. The chapter, What would you do if you weren't afraid, was particularly insightful. Not all women suffer from these kinds of self-limiting behaviors, but all of us impose some of them on ourselves.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Amazing,couldn't put the book down,I am going to continue with this series.hopefully this series will continue with its interesting theme
B003FSTN52|5.0|my daughter in law has really enjoyed this birthday gift.  i think she will want to get more seasons of this show.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Usually by the third season most shows seem to lose their motion causing disinterest. I found the third season of Walking Dead just as exciting and fresh as the first season. Cannot wait to see what they have in store for us in the fourth season. Big high five!
193700788X|3.0|I had a suspicion this was how the book/series would end; I'm fine with it, although I've personally never felt a spark when reading about that particular character.  I totally support Ms. Harris's right and decision to go where she wanted to go with this book and end it like she wanted to.  I am very sorry there are readers who feel a need to attack and pitch a fit because creative control went to the writer and not the reader.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading it; I'm glad Sookie's going to have some peace in her life.  There would have been little long term happiness for Sookie had Ms. Harris ended it the way many readers would have liked.<br /><br />I look forward to future books from Charlaine Harris.
0399226907|5.0|I brought this book for my daughter as it was one of my favourite and she loves it. Good quality.
B002JI94J4|5.0|What more does one need to say? This is practically a &#34;day in the life&#34; of the world's greatest rock band and their antics in this movie are reminiscence of the old Marx Bros movies. It's a lot of fun with great music.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|It keeps me entertain and you can't beat the price.  You only get a set number of lives and gain more lives every 10 mins which can be annoying.  I just switch to another game for a bit.  Other than that, I have fun playing it.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Lots of action.  Easy to follow (and jump ahead)  story line.  If you have a couple of free hours and want to see a somewhat extreme plot about survival and  government involvement in an individual's life...you might enjoy the movie.<br /><br />John R
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This feels just like the most popular story about the little minions who worked with Gru this is amazing. NICE
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like Entwined. But, I hate Sylvia Day left me hanging.  It was a good read, just needed more grit.  I like how Sylva answer most of the unanswered question and continue with other unanswered questions like who actually killed Nathan... Who placed the bracelet on his wrist? What's up with Gideon's mother? What roll did she play in his illness?  Well, I hope the next book gives us True GRIT!  Thrills, Chills, Suspense and streamy romance.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Very sweet movie about life and the choices we make and how these shape our lives.  Maggie Smith was wonderful and I found some other old friends from the British comedies and other older films. Very enjoyable - left you with a good feeling about how life can turn out!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great app not too hard but still not easy. just waiting for more levels to come out! I love it and would recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like games with a challenge and this kept my interest. I had to force myself to quit playing so I could get my work done.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|prompt service, instant download, easy to read on kindle book, would buy again via kindle store.  save space without carrying around a book
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game. The ads are annoying. The \\"print\\" ads you can dismiss with one click are not so bad but the videos are a real pain.
B000065V3H|4.0|Great movie, brings a lot of memories, reminds me of the 1980's when I was a young boy attending high school.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is adorable and good for all ages! I love it and would give it the 5 stars hands down.
B00421IR5I|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults alike.  Daughter rated it the funniest movie she's ever seen!  Highly recommend for everyone looking for a good clean laugh.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This movie is a message to the 1960's...<br />We could have won Viet Nam just by giving in<br />and allowing the Viet Cong to unite Viet Nam?<br />These are 11 major lesions that should be taught<br />to all who want to rule justly in time of war.<br />Those in power today should watch this movie<br />and pay attention, as here is the best of us<br />laying it on the line.
0307744434|1.0|The author was able to capture the magical mysterious essence of a circus but fell way short otherwise. The story goes on and on w/o really going anywhere and the characters were flimsily constructed. Very disappointing.
B008XKT9FG|3.0|The acting was just OK, the story line is interesting but slow.  I know it's just me but I don't like Helen Hunts voice.  The sets are beautiful and the setting is beautiful.  Hang in their and watch to the end so finish the plot.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I had my doubts when I ordered this because of the discounted price.  I figured there was a 75% chance it would be a used piece of junk but I took the gamble and am glad I did.  It works perfectly and has been very helpful on unfamiliar golf courses.  I have owned sky caddies in the past but to be honest I like the range finder better.  Very helpful on the driving range getting the truth about my distances.  I have found I like to use the scan mode more that the pin seeker mode.  I want to thank Amazon for the 30 day return policy.  This takes the stress out of being stuck with a lemon product.  Just return it if not happy.  Love it!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I am not a Star Trek fan. I don't know much about Star Trek. However, I knew just enough to realize who the characters were and I actually, truly enjoyed it! AND we're going to watch the new Star Trek movie in theaters...because I want to!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Watching the walking dead series is awesome for zombie fans.  They leave out nothing;  blood, gore, scarey scenes.  They show the zombies eating people.  Should be rated R though.  I'm hopelesly hooked.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Very easy to navigate, great puzzles, and good graphics. However it took forever to download. Once it was up and running, I was hooked.
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|This is a great read. Mustaine tells it like it is. A humble human being. Inspirational. The guys from Metallica should read this one...
1575666286|5.0|This book was the stepping stone for us to better health and well being. We were created to be strong health people. We have been searching for a better way to eat and through this research we know that we can live long and healthy lives. I am a 23 year cancer survivor, through the power of GOD and eating the way we are suppose to.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|Most gripping tv series I've ever seen.  I'm hooked.  The quality of the video was excellent.  No commercials interupting the episodes is an advantage.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really fun<br />you should install this I promise. you. will be playing it all day more than wacthing tv
0810979772|5.0|Love this book as it keeps the kids entertained and helps build imagination.  It is a good do-it-yourself book for an elementary age to create a story.  Great addition for those who have read the wimpy kid books.
B00006NSGX|5.0|This is one of the best live Clapton CD's I have heard. It's got blues, jazz and the great Cream songs. I listen to this alot. Helps me get through the day.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|I dunno. I first saw this at the cinema in IMAX 3D and was blown away. The film indeed has incredible visuals, but I felt, as a story, it was pretty generic and flat. I likened it to one of those simulator rides at a fairground where the experience is more important than the story. So when I watched this again on Blu-ray in the comfort of my own home, I was again impressed by the effects, but frankly got a bit bored by the story. For me, it's a 'watch once and enjoy' film, but not something I want to own. I sold the Blu-ray and I don't miss it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is awesome for all ages it makes you have a lot have fun with this amazing app ever
B00BC24NT4|4.0|The ending is unsatisfactory.  Otherwise a good read.  Typical Le Carre.  I would recommend it to readers who liked his other books.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|The first of the trilogy was fantastic.  The second one was just so so.  The third one was okay but did not like the end because u left us hanging which is probably what u wanted to do.  I loved all your previous books.
B001RTP48Q|5.0|I've been a huge PSB fan since 1985, when I bought West End Girls. It's funny that whenever they bring out a new album, people call it a return to form. For all of their 12 studio (including Electric which I can't wait for!) albums, they've maintained the most amazing level of quality.<br /><br />Anyway, on this album, the masterstroke is partnering with Xenomania, who have an amazing knack of pumping out slightly off-kilter hits such as Girl's Aloud's 'Biology', possibly the most weirdly structured song ever (who needs a chorus anyway?). This can make it sound in parts like it's not a PSB album (witness Love Etc.). However, the Boys do shine through and while I find some of the songs a bit off (I just can't like Legacy), there are some classic PSB songs here, especially 'Did You See Me Coming?', an exuberantly happy song which immediately earned a place in my top 5 PSB songs (look for the 'Possibly More' remix of this track, completely restructured and completely amazing). The rest of the songs are all consistently good and in among the higher tempo stuff, you'll find the beautiful 'King of Rome' and even a bit of 60's influence in 'Beautiful People'<br /><br />Finally, if you can find it, look out for the special edition version. While it contains some so-so 'dub' versions of the songs, it also contains the fantastic 'This Used to be the Future', featuring Neil, Phil Oakey (from the Human League) and Chris actually singing!! A brilliant duet. No, hang on, there's 3 of them. What do you call that? A truet? Well who cares, this is a great PSB album and a great purchase.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest for so many reasons! You should see my 50+ boards full of helpful information!<br /><br />I've been using Pinterest for about a year and the only thing that I don't like is finding a pin that has no link to it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Loved the earlier version. Please give the option of reverting to the previous version. I am deleting this app immediately.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|um,  my title explains it!<br />I love the movies and now I love the game!<br />download it (you wont be disappointed)
B005LAII1C|5.0|Like Family Guy? You'll love this. It's like a live-action version of the program with a talking teddy bear that spouts obscenities and gets stoned.<br />It's puerile, childish, ridiculous, rude, politically incorrect and obnoxious. I loved it!<br />Really, if that's not your cup of tea, you're not going to like this. Me? I laughed all the way through it.<br />Surprisingly, it also has some pretty sweet parts too.<br />Highly recommended with the reservations above :-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Five times better than subway surfers and temple run combined i love this game it is awesome and u should try ive been waiting forever to be in the amazon market its finally here u wont regret download today!!
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|This is still as absorbing as when I first saw it years ago. Story line, acting, are as brilliant as the re-mastered picture and sound. It is a must see.
B0001I55SS|3.0|I wanted to see this movie so bad when I was a kid. I was 6 years old when this movie came out. For me It did not disappoint. I got what I wanted. My dad hated this movie. He thought it was a mess.<br /><br />In retrospect...I loved the soundtrack. I loved Vincent. I loved old bob. I was really interested in the storyline. For the time the movie is dated. But I think that the film has potential.<br /><br />If Disney wants to do something productive...they should remake this film.<br /><br />Overall I recommend for a kid to see at least once. :)
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Bought all 3 CD's. Love them all; he sounds a lot like Bob Dylan in his younger days when his voice wasn't as gravelly as it is now.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Koi No Yokan proves the Deftones continue to be successful at creating great music. For anyone who has been a long time fan of the Deftones previous work, this album falls right in line with their previous releases.  This album stands out as not only a great Deftones album, but one of the best hard rock releases of 2012.  The albums catches you right from the very opening chords of Swerve City and doesn't let you down until the album is over.  While there really isn't a track worth not listening to on the album, I would strongly recommend \\"Leathers\\", \\"Poltergeist\\", \\"Gauze\\" and \\"Rosemary\\" as the best of the best.  Certainly for anyone who is a fan of hard rock music, this should be an essential addition to your collection.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the characters and the surprises in the series.<br /><br />Downton Abbey, with captions, was huge incentive to join Amazon Prime.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use, multiple translations and a great search utility.  Thanks to the ones who made this app available free of charge.  God Bless
B001BKVWYG|5.0|We watched a special about him on TV, really liked his music, and got all three CD's. Wonderful music, a little Bob Dylanish in style.
0425263924|5.0|Not a lot of info in it. Hope fourth book comes soon to answer all my questions? Keeps you questing.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|loved it cant wait till the next one!!!!! best series I have read in a long time!! would recommend this to anyone!!
B00DU74U74|4.0|I had tried to read the book a few times, and just couldn't get through it. So, I wasn't expecting much when I decided to watch it. Well, it held my attention from start to finish. Some parts we a little off for me, but I did like the cast. I thought it was pretty well executed for not having a good basis to begin with in the book. I would recommend this if you like unusual romance type of movies.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Grandson and I both love this app.We compare our parks everytime he visits. He loves the dinosaurs and the underwater creatures too.HAVING Issues with update.HELP!!! SO I CAN KEEP PLAYING:')
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|absolutely love it I love the movie and the game. they have a very great job with game. like what other people said it is like a mixture of temple run2 and subway suffers COMBINED! it is also available for all ages I think any age would also love the game I would highly recommend it to everyone. especially for people who love despicable me like I do:) it is also great because it is FREE it could probably .99 so also u should be grateful toward that!!! I hope anyone else who buys this game will have just as much fun with it as I did!!! ALSO VERY ADDICTING! im playing rite now but I cant sop lol;)
B009HUB40Y|4.0|its a fun game but the only drawbk is as most games there are too many ads. I would rate it with 5 stars if not for that.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This is not a great movie, but it is a great deal of fun to watch.  Actors are all likeable and the story moves along.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|doesn't wanna load on my kindle fire takes a cert long time to get this game took me almost 2 days to fully download I really think its a waste of time.
B000002UWF|5.0|LOUIS PRIMA-COLLECTOR SERIES: Those too young to remember New Orleans native LOUIS PRIMA's boisterous brand of big band boogie woogie firsthand have nonetheless been exposed to his tireless talent...ex-VAN HALEN wailer DAVID LEE ROTH hit with a note for note copy of JUST A GIGELO/I AIN'T GOT NOBODY and THE BRIAN SETZER ORCHESTRA started a swing revival covering JUMP, JIVE & WAIL. The Vegas lounge legend's swaggering, irrepressible style, enforced by his main foil SAM BUTERA's squonking tenor sax peals, propelled gonzo originals like BANANA SPLIT FOR MY BABY, OH MARIE and the sci-fi goof BEEP-BEEP. He was also the king of cocky cover duets like I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN and THAT OLD BLACK MAGIC with his coolly detached spouse SMITH, who warbled everything perfectly straight in direct contrast to PRIMA's hammy, over the top delivery. CAPITOL RECORDS' excellent COLLECTORS SERIES provides exquisite liner notes, photos and song selection, a must own collection for fans of LOUIS PRIMA...whose music, like the man himself, was never any less than indescribably wild, swingin' and energetic.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE BIG GRINS
B000TTRGUE|5.0|It does suck there is no switch on this and it does not come with a cable. However the microphone itself is very high quality. A solid and quite heavy piece of work.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Loved it in the theatre, now I enjoy it whenever I want!  Also nice to have multiple copies in case you want to travel.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Many twists, Characters. Some you will love and other you would want to smack. But the humor and story lines are fantastic.
B006ORLAPC|1.0|VERY unhappy :(<br />It said it would play on my DVD player & it didn't. I bought this as a gift for my husband. We went to watch it and it won't play! It says it SHOULD play, but it didn't. VERY UNHAPPY :(<br />Give it one star because I couldn't give it 0 stars!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really liked it because it was very challenging for me like I always wanted to complete a mission so I gave it a five star
0007450664|5.0|I recommend reading the series even if you've been watching the show. The books are a great read and include a lot of nice details that enhance the television series.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|For those who are looking for a totally accurate rendering of the life of Vikings you should look elsewhere.  However, if you are looking for entertaining television set in a relatively accurate historical setting this is your show.  Ragnar Loethbrok wants riches and knowledge.  Taking a huge risk in defying his chieftain he finances his own raiding trip across little known waters to explore and plunder the British Isles.  \\"Vikings\\" follow the adventures of Ragnars band as they ply the seas as well as explores the relationships and politics that underly life in whatever time period.<br /><br />\\"Vikings\\" is not for the squeemish.  Bloody battle scenes and realistic depictions of the violent life and culture of the Norsemen are in most episodes as well as a little sexuality that goes beyond PG-13, but not quite to rated R.<br /><br />Overall, though it is well worth your time to watch.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book captured what it was like for immigrants struggling to make a living & ultimately making a better life for their children..All told through the eyes of a young precocious child.<br />A loving, but alcoholic dad, a mother, strong as nails & a delightful extended family, surrounded this young girl.  A depressing story?? No..just a story of a young girl growing up...wonderfully written.<br />.
B0047WJ12K|3.0|I thought this movie was just OK (bought it as a gift for someone who asked for it specifically).  I found the plot to be hard to follow<br />at times.  Not my favorite.  :-/
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I like this game but, there are major flaws.<br /><br />They fixed the arctic update, install (forced update might lose whole game,update says already have it).<br /><br />I found that the timer inaccurately counts. E.g. on an 11 hour wait, it took 2 hours longer.<br /> ·Percentile is wrong. Dino makes 10299, added parasaurus rock fossil (10%)(700,000 coins), now it makes 10743 coins. 10% of 10,000 is 1,000. Should be 11,330.<br /> ·The game glitches, and three times it took 2 dollars each time, that's 6 dollars lost.<br />·
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|I love how this band is maturing. With this album the songs are more distinguishable than any of their previous.
1781162646|5.0|As usual Mr King delivers, not his usual work but as good as usual.  A definited old styled detective read.
B007SWZVBQ|4.0|I actually got this CD thinking it had the songs from Glee Volume 4.  So I ordered this by mistake, but it is a nice CD with some good songs.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I love how Diana wynne Jones wrote about howl and Sophie. I have the anime movie of howls moving castle and I love both views of each person. They are both romantic and adventurous wich I like very much. I hope she will write more stories about Howl, Sophie, Calcifer, and Michael. I am very glad to have both the book and the movie to watch and read over and over again. And I do hope she writes more stories about them! It's great for teens and adults who look for adventure and a happy ending.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Although, lengthy, it was worth every page. Social suffrage, history, and romance mixed in one. Now time for the movie!!
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Years after watching all the episodes ,and giving away my dvds it is great that I can stream lost in hd whenever I want . thanks amazon.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this a lot. Cause I love jurassice park and I love the game jurassic park operation genesis. so I watched lots of jurassic park movies. And its a great game for androids.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|It's all so real. The feelings,good and bad, always true. Ms Rowell has created a perfect storm of damage and triumph. And it hurts so good.
0374525153|3.0|I bought this little book because I saw the movie starring Jason Robards. The movie was much more dramatic and carried a<br />bigger wallop. The book can be read in one setting and is well worth reading. Likely if a hadn't seen the movie I would have<br />been more moved by the book.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Big bang is great Jim Parsons was born for the roll of Sheldon . He makes the show ,but Penny just keeps getting better.
0553108034|5.0|The best epic phantasy series, the original book is far better than the tv series on HBO.<br />I recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />The 2nd book is just as good as the 1st book.
B001KRVLCI|3.0|got this for my girlfriend too, i dont like john travolta movie, but other than that its not a bad movie.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|Strike one, no instructions.<br />Strike two, no way to win.<br />Strike three, NO INSTRUCTIONS!!!!<br /><br />No pride was taken here making this game. Why would you put out a product like this? Do you take this seriously at all? Who makes a game without instructions? I un installed this less than an hour after installing. Add some instructions and make less balls pop up at random, causing a never winning game, and it would be fun.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Never played a game like this before. Was fun though frustrating at times. Liked the challenge.  Send more floors, please!
0553106635|5.0|The best epic phantasy series, the original book is far better than the tv series on HBO.<br />I recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />The 3rd books is the best of a Song of Ice and Fire, I would rate it 6 stars if I could.<br />A must read.
B001UGIIMA|4.0|I really enjoy this movie.  I like the stuff with Redford at the CIA/NSA, and I love Brad Pitt in almost anything.  The movie drags a bit past the middle, but it has a good ending.  I bought this for 2 or 3 dollars, why not add it to your collection, cheaper than a rental!<br /><br />There is cursing, violence (murder), sex, but no nudity.  So it should be fine for your mature teenager, this is mild compared to a lot of PG-13 stuff today.
193700788X|5.0|I hope that Charlaine Harris will not stick to her guns on this one and some day will bring Sookie and all the rest back for some more adventures. This is the last book of the Sookie Stackhouse series. A great bunch of quick reads with lots of action, surprises, comic relief and so much more. I will miss having these books to look forward to.  But it was a great way to finish it up!
B003UBTX72|2.0|There is a road-kill like appeal to any well known person who puts themselves on display.  But thoughtfulness and structure beyond chronology is expected when someone commits to writing a book. This is unfortunately little more than an egotistical meander through a life of experiences.  It is intriguing to get some small insights into the various other characters that Keith Richards has interacted with.  But little effort went into the writing and little will remain with me.  Bill Wyman's account seems more promising.
0553801473|5.0|The best epic phantasy series, the original book is far better than the tv series on HBO.<br />I recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />Twin to the 4th book, this is the better half.<br />If you read up to the 5th book you will be certainly couting the minutes for the 6th book release.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|My son was glued to the TV - it was exciting, yet still very kid friendly.  He watched 3 times over the 24hr rental time period.
1416955070|5.0|This is the second time I am purchasing this book. That's because I lend it out so often I had to get another copy. It has a great flow to it and I have found that adults as well as teens love it. It's the first book in an awesome series!  And the movie comes out soon!!  Can't wait to see all of the great characters on the big screen!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I really did not want this movie to be terrible. But, turns out that this is a really cute romance. Who would have thought they could pull that off with zombies?<br />My husband and I debated over something we consider to be a plot hole, but the discussion was fun and made the experience all the more enjoyable.
0553801503|5.0|The best epic phantasy series, the original book is far better than the tv series on HBO.<br />I recommend it to everyone.<br />The 4th book is twin to the 5th book. Although I find it the less exciting of the serie, it's still a great book.
0743525043|3.0|it's O.K Not as ground revealing as I had hoped for. Just okay.<br />Would I recommend it.Well depending really on your sports and college experience.
0062020897|4.0|I gave it a four star because I thought it was slow starting but it soon had me hooked and even though Follett is one of the best, they can't all be 5 star, just almost. I've read most of his books and I can never wait to get the next one. Anyone who loves history and thrillers would love this book!
B00C1DR9FS|5.0|If you like One Republic you will like this cd.  I don't have it on me to tell you which songs I like best, but it is a good cd.

B009GI8J1O|1.0|Authors writing style was awful, didnt seem to flow at all i was very disappointed, the summary made the book out to be very cool, but it was very lame. Waste of 12.99 coulda got two or three other books, this books all hype from the movie
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like this app. I especially like the fact that it works even when the device is turned off.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This is everything they said it was and is a wonderful case for your kindle. I love the different position you have to choose from too.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Really fun!  I thought I was doing something wrong when I couldn't bear it on the first go but then realized you had to gain skills and figure out which ones were more important and then it became a challenge too.  Still working on beating it but enjoying it all the while!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game. Wish there were more levels and &quot;hints&quot;.  Overall fun game but with only 10 levels got through it quickly.
1475143389|5.0|5 Stars for sure.  What a wonderfully written outline of how to gain lean mass and lose fat.  I have just completed my first 8 weeks, and I chose to Bulk instead of cut even though I am pretty overweight at 6.1&#34; 230lbs.  I put on 2 pounds total but I have been tracking my body fat using Calipers and my overall strength by testing my bench, military and squat max every 2 weeks.  I have added 6 pounds of lean mass to my body and only gained 2 pounds so the fat is leaving for sure.  I have been adding the 3 lifts together and getting one number I am calling my strength.  My strength number has gone up by 130 pounds in 8 weeks.  I love seeing these types of improvements happening to my 37 year old body.
B005K17RU0|3.0|the upgrade took a simple, yet elegant app &amp; complicated it by jamming in just about every piece of weather info one could think of.  why?  the beauty of the original was that what I most wanted to see most often popped up immediately in full screen.
B003G4W49C|1.0|Like many others I picked this book based on the many positive reviews, awards, and such;, but to say I didn't like this book would be putting it mildly. I wouldn't even know whom to recommend this book to. There's so many repetitive game strategy descriptions it's not even funny. The characters are for the most part flat and unsympathetic. The dialogue is simple, something out of a cartoon show. The plot may have been something novel at the time it was written, which I guess was at some point during the cold war, but now it's just all around silly and for the most part predictable, only towards the end there was a little tidbit that caught my interest but all in all I don't think it was worth my time, don't waste yours.
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|Awesome tracks to bring you back to the days when Sabbath first brought out their metal onslaught! Can't wait for the concert!
0385349947|5.0|great read.  can't do enough to empower my daughter to believe in herself and to believe that Anything is within reach with the right strategy, attitude, work ethic and the insatiable desire to achieve her goals without compromising her ethics or her soul.
1781162646|5.0|Good story reminiscent of old serial tales. I really enjoyed it. I am a horror fan but I'll read anything King writes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and would recommend it to anyone! There is plenty of drama and love stories and constant entertainment!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Anyone who's already looking at this knows it's an amazing series that ended too quickly. There's nothing more I can say than that it's a great series and they did a great job packaging a shipping it.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|great tale over the years.  Very gripping as the younger generation causes problems. Looking foreward to the next installment.  Loves it.
B0026P40NU|5.0|this is a tumultuous and absolutely wonder filled depiction of four of the Pre-Raphaelite  painters.  I will watch again and again.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Do Hallmark Card commercials bring tears to your eyes?<br /><br />Do Thomas Kinkade paintings take your breath away?<br /><br />Does Kenny G \\"music\\" put you in the mood?<br /><br />If you said, \\"Yes!\\" to all of the above, then this movie is definitely for YOU!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Easy enjoyable quick read. I'm looking forward to reading more of the Richard Castle books in this series.  Truly enjoyable
B00DHNAQ2Y|1.0|If you're into gore, this is the movie for you!  I thought it'd be like the original movie but it was VERY different! Be ready!
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|IThis was a great movie, loved the special effects and action. Would recommend this to anyone who loves movies and sci-fi buffs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addictive fun game put together nicely. Something new at every level. Some are easier than others.<br />Fun game<br />How many levels are there
0307887448|5.0|As someone who doesn't read many books I couldn't put Ready Player One down. It finds a way to weave several of my favorite topics into a single story and introduce me to several more! I look forward to anything new by Ernest Cline! Keep up the good work!
B004IPPINW|4.0|Hamid builds his story, and the suspense, brilliantly in this short, fast-paced tale.  The narrator is a high-achieving Pakistani who went to Princeton on a scholarship and joined a McKinsey-type consulting firm.  He both admires and resents America.  Resentment gets the upper hand following a failed love affair and 9/11.  The novel is set after his return to Lahore, where he has grown a beard and become a college professor who mentors fundamentalist students.  The narrator tells his story to a suspicious American in a Lahore market cafe, and the reader must try to figure out who the narrator really is and what his and his listener's intentions are towards each other.  How one reads the situation as it unfolds probably says as much or more about the reader as about the characters.  I was thoroughly engaged and went on to read Hamid's next book -- How to get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia -- which I would give five stars.  The Reluctant Fundamentalist is clever, witty and engaging, but not as touching as Filthy Rich.  I would recommend reading both: and I am going to read Moth Smoke.
B005TBWN0K|3.0|Just installed on a new kindle fire HD 8.9 and it goes back to the main menu unexpectedly without saving.  I love the functionality otherwise, particularly the map markup.  Fix the bug, and this is 5 stars easy.
B005544V6A|5.0|Highly intelligent, incredibly witty, and strikingly dramatic. All of that combined with love triangles and deception, I couldn't ask for more. Great show!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have had no issues with this on my kindle fire. its actually better than I thought it would be. I recommend it.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|using this app is just like using face book on a laptop or desk computer - if you are a face booker than you need this app.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Can't wait for the new season to start, and I hope it continues on for many more seasons.  The last episode was a tragic shocker.  I predict Edith will rule Downton when Patrick reappears in the future and they marry.  Poor Lady Mary.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Seemed like the book was hurried. Could have been better! Left hanging a bit. Alright for what it was! Maybe there will be another one!
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Must see 80's movie.  If you're into that genre, and haven't seen this movie, what are you waiting for?  Classic...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written and easy to follow even for those who have not served. A real page turner that is strongly recommended
1615230823|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. This book cover all forms of success in which life creates them. The most powerful rule that success can originate from is the 10,000 hour rule. Everybody can use this in their life no matter what your career field is!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed the story.  I can't wait for the next one.  She moves from one adventure to another.  Awesome!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very good puzzle game.  Will keep you going for hours. Keeps challenging your puzzle solving ability. Good graphics too. Excellent choice.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|doesn't take up much room, but does the job.  just a few draws and you are in business.<br />keeps things in shape
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|at the top of the carts noting well bet it the best game in the world!!!#1 brelent wonderful awsome and amazing game in the world
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I rented it to watch with the children.  For such a nice and funny movie I was mildly surprised it was not a Disney flick.  But it is also relieving to know that Disney is not the only source of good children's movies these days.  I highly recommend it and the children anxiously await being able to see the sequel.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing, great writers.your season finale was very suspenseful.characters and its numerous plot line makes it very interesting. all three seasons have been wonderful so far.
B00CKWQN9S|5.0|didn&#34;t expect to like this. very good artists. go see the movie. fun to play. good for parties. enjoy this.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Put this app on the Kindle Fire to let the kids have a turn at playing a 'video game'. They seem to enjoy it, they are only 3, 5, and 6, and the touch screen is easy for them to learn.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have always loved that era, and this sheds a new light on the political and social dynamics of these people...
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Dyfed due hehe disused dishes she's doing so sorry status of the day left for you to get the best way<br />To get the best way to get the best way to get the best
B00CLD65X0|5.0|All my wife's fault. My wife got me hooked into this. Every season gets better. Can't wait for Season 4.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|When I first bought the charger it worked fine.. then, just 4 days after the return deadline it DIED!! Figures..
B00AVFO41K|4.0|I enjoyed this game.  The negative reviews are correct about one thing: this game is hard.  I've played it a few times and I have not cleared the board. However, the special marbles are a neat addition to the game play.  I would recommend this to advanced gamers or people who enjoy challenging games.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The Enders Game as third always seemed to mock the games that we were never meant to be played.It shows us the existence of human nature to survive. At what cost though. I was always intrigued by how he could over come obsticals. I used to try to do it by myself  but the the fact that stayed was you always needed someone to be there. The characters grip you into an intense battle that comes through with bitter grief for ender. That soon became to define a more refined ender. It is a great book, I still remembered most of it.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Nice story line with cute characters. Great for families, especially dads with daughters. Can 't wait to see the sequel which just came out.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Dustin Hoffman gives a performance that simply astounds us. Tom Cruise shows all about how a brother should feel about his sibling with a disability.  Both of these actors deserve awards for such a touching film about how to treat our family even if we dont understand.
B000AQJPQE|4.0|My son was so happy when I swow to him the gift for his bedroom.<br /><br />It was great to see his happiness.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Love these books .very big file hard to find your place sometimes .great read.<br />Moves well but long . A little different from tee HBO show .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great book, great story.  Keeps you coming back makes you feel sad and happy all at the same time.  At first I thought it was going to be an ordinary novel.  I was so wrong.  Very good read
0425263924|5.0|Would definitely recommend to anyone who loved the 50 shades books or the Stark Series...great read, fast delivery, will go thru again to order!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a decent game. The only level I had troubles on was 10. The rest of the game was almost too easy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and hard to stop playing. You keep thinking just one more level and next thing you know it's after midnight and you're still playing.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Absolutely loved this one.  You just keep trying to figure it out and nothing works.  You are dying to get through the book just because you have so much doubt you are right and you are wrong.  Everything I thought might be the plot was not the plot, wow.  It kept me coming back.  Loved it.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|I tried to forget his stature becausee I like him in Mission Impossible but the fight scenes just dont make sense for this little guy. Cruise should stick to the trick stuff and stay away from the fights. Im sure of all the actors someone mire like Reacher could have been found. Let \\"the girl\\"be the big name. I love the Reacher books and expected a lot to be twisted as usual with movies but wasnt too disappointed with plot. Some a bit over the top torture and villian one dimensional. Never explains why. I will have to review the book but I dont think Jack would have killed him without giving him a chance to fight back ashw did the sniper.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is an amazing, fun, and cool game to play. I heard everyone talking about it and playing it, and I wanted to see what I was missing out on. I started playing and now, I love playing it and I might be getting addicted to it Lol.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Unbelivable album. Definitely exceeded my expectations! The bonus disc is awesome as well.<br />Sabbath stiil rules! Hopefully there will be more in the future.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|read this book when I was 30 years old.  I am 63 now.  Will never loan it out will never not have it on my shelf, will always make my grandchildren read it.  It should be a must read for all high schools.  You should not be able to graduate without this one.  It never stops showing you the way.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|This Film helps define the difference between what is a movie and what is a film. An amazing story, epic characters and beautiful sweeping landscapes. There are no special effects here, no explosions, no CGI, just epic storytelling. The pacing is slow no doubt about it but that does not make the movie slow. You're given chances to appreciate the characters and their motivations. Each conversation is meaningful. Each character is relevant. Truly an amazing film. Watch it, and love it.
0316247545|5.0|The thing with this book is that, while it does have information on characters, locations, and even some words by the writers, at least two thirds of the book is nothing more than episode summaries that people who've watched every episode multiple times would only read if they were bored and had nothing better to do. Consider that when buying it you're really just paying for that one third of interesting information.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|its really fun but I have some things that I would rather do. it addictive.but is also fun.I recommend getting this app but don't spend too much time on this one app.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|educational.colorful.etc... at the moment I have filled the entire space on the floor of the ocean / sea. I need more space, please. I'm in my fifty 's and I enjoy it.
B00459EZLW|5.0|This is by far the best of the Star Gate shows. Some one needs to bring the writing team back together and give it a proper finish.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|love this item got it for my wife for her birthday and she was very pleased with it nuff said
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|I do not like the fact that every time I fail to complete a level, it takes me back to the first level.  It would be less frustrating to take me back to the last level completed instead of the first level.  I can only play this game for a little while before I get frustrated when I keep getting sent back to the first level again.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it. Glad I can finally link it from my kindle to FB. Favorite bingo game. Wish all games I play on FB would work on the kindle
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Very challenging, kept my mind going! When I got stuck on something it drove me crazy until I figured it out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this game Is fun and very entertaining. I suggest you get this game!  I always enjoy solving the puzzles and figuring out what comes next. The clues within the game are very clever and well thought out. Sometimes I would get stuck and retrace my steps, but over all the game isn't to difficult. I like to play every other day to get my daily dose of thinking. Especially in the summer when there's no school. To wrap things up, I think this game is enjoyable and you should try it.
B00DQ4MGB8|5.0|Drama, mystery, comedy, action thriller, and romance plus great entertainment.  McQueen bests P. Brosnan role he performed in the remake, but I think R. Russo outdid F. Dunnaway by a mile.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Fast paced and well written. Interesting take on the genre. Cohesive narrative at times difficult to sort out (consequence of the broken interview style). All in all enjoyable for anyone who is a fan of zombie literature, and a good entry point for those who are not yet.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best book I've read in a while.<br />Romance with a twist, once you start the book it is hard to put it down. Ending I did not expect, but I loved it, and I'm eager to read the next book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is NOT just another YA/supernatural/creature/love story.  I watched the series on Netflix first and then read the book.  Having seen the show did not diminish the storyline impact and did, as all good books do, provide more nuanced perspective for each of the characters who are engaging, complex, and yet very human.  Great read - for any season.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|it is a must that you read his best work. The Alchemist is almost like The Bible with all the wisdom compacted in a book.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Amazon, I truly do not know what I'd do wout you. I had to replace a few Dvds n Blue ray discs and yall saved the day. Thank you PRB
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I absolutely loved the first book Bared To You and went straight on to reading Reflected In You. The second book didn't impress me as much as the first but I was still eagerly waiting for Entwined In You to come out. After the book being delayed several times, it was hard to jump back into the story so I had to re-read the second book to recap.<br /><br />I did enjoy Entwined In You - until the sudden, unexpected ending that informed us that their was going to be another book. After waiting nearly a year for this one I don't think I have the patience to keep waiting for a 4th one when the story could have been wrapped up in the trilogy it was originally meant to be.
B000W1SSV0|5.0|Stan Getz is Stan Getz. This is where he truly blossoms with something that he did better than anyone. It's Charlie Byrd that pushes this over the top for me. Add in two stone classic Brazilian tunes, Desafinado an One Note Samba and you have one of the all time greats.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved the book and could not set it down.  This book and it's charaters compelled me to read further about a sad part of our history.
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|I watched Hesher for the first time yesterday on TV.  It's a good thing it was on a movie channel!  It would be very hard to watch with all the language bleeped out and all the commercials.  I just bought the movie because It's one I would like to watch occasionally and show to friends.  I almost feel like I discovered it. All the characters were very believable and in perfect form for their roles.  Piper Laurie was a nice surprise in the role as the grandmother.  I believe she played the mother of the original Carrie in the Steven King film.  If you appreciate a very different, black, funny, rather shocking movie, than by all means check out Hesher.  I loved the ending.  I would call it a very happy ending.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Was a little concerned when I ordered this case that the rotating feature might fail. Was very happy to learn that this feature was constructed so well. The case is not as light as some of the others I looked at. Think it is because of the third section and the fact that it is padded so well. Would recommend this case especially to someone who travels a lot.
B005FITIF0|1.0|I have read about and even supported the real preacher.  However, if this movie is realistic to what really happened, for a Christian family THIS IS NOT A FAMILY MOVIE!  It was so graphic, with violence, sex, drugs and heavily foul language at the beginning, my family and I could not bare to watch past the first 10 minutes.  Give me a break - this guy says the F-word like in every sentence.  \\"Fudge\\" or something cleaner would have done the trick.<br /><br />I am so disappointed, I may throw the box out so that no one else has to be subjected to this way too realistic movie.  Can't they make a movie with a cleaner, PG-rated script?  We can get the point without the realistic language and action.<br /><br />Sorry to say, I cannot recommend this movie, even if the end of the movie is good.  It's too much for this born-again Christian and family.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|\\"Babel\\" is a really good album, the lyrics are amazing (as usual). The only thing I don't like is that the album doesn't say anything about being explicit, even though some of the songs do have cursing in them.
B0036UMM84|5.0|This is my favorite version of the movie...and such great music to! Barbara Streisand is just awesome! Haven't seen it in years, and now I'm glad to add it to my library. Also, really quick delivery! Had it in just a couple days! Thank you Amazon!
B00BW0QC8G|5.0|I have a huge collection of luggage of all sorts--camera cases, suitcases, carry-ons, and backpacks.  This Case Logic backpack is a nice addition to my collection.<br /><br />The backpack is heavier than a regular backpack due to the padding for the electronics. It will fit a laptop, netbook, iPad or other tablet as well as room for a change of clothes, books or other items.<br /><br />There are three large compartments. The back compartment that will hold the laptop or netbook is nicely padded. The padding is thick enough that if you bring the pack hiking that sweat won't leak through the material to the computer. It contains a pocket that you can put cords and other accessories in.  The second compartment could hold a change of clothes or books or travel stuff. There is a large pocket as well as a mesh pocket. The third compartment has pockets for small items as well as a mesh pocket.<br /><br />On the outside there is a sturdy handle  to carry the pack with and then a smaller handle to hang it on a hook.  There is a small pocket for your phone or earbuds, a pocket on the very front of the pack that will fit a decent amount of stuff. There are two side pockets, one has a latch for a keyring. The other pocket has a 'doo-hickey' to shove your earbud cords through it so that you can house your iPod safely.  There is a pocket in the back that can hold the backpack straps and once they are out and in use it becomes a secure, hidden compartment for money or passport type papers.<br /><br />The exterior dimensions are: 13.4&#34; x 12.2&#34; x 19.3&#34;  -- plenty of room inside for hiking or a carry on.<br /><br />The backpack has nicely padded straps and an adjustable sternum strap for comfort.  I'm planning to take this on a trip to Italy so I will be able to give it a thorough workout!

B002WIDRM6|1.0|What is it with country music? It is SO predictable, all sounds the same, and the voices do too. I thought I would give this album a chance since the title track was covered by Shakira and Keith Urban on American Idol in recent times. I have listened to the album 5 times and it is so boring. Not one track stands out as an amazing composition. In fact it sounds like Taylor Swift at times. It sounds like other country singers too. Why do people like this sort of music? Country music is almost as bad as listening to rap.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|these stories are exciting and some times hard to read but I love a good myistery murder and they sure write good ones.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this puzzle/problem solving mystery game. I would get stuck and get a bit frustrated but I always got it in the end. I look forward to more rooms being added soon!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging, my daughter and I loved playing it together. Can't wait for more floors to keep the game going.
B0040I09RM|4.0|A bit too violent, and some of the actors don't seem to be doing their best work, but the concept is good, and we watch the show off and on.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the game. Some things are a little  hard to figure out but once you get into it it comes easier. Just tap everything lol
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|What can go wrong with so many Metal Gear Solid games in one box?<br /><br />This is an awesome collection with the best games of all time!<br /><br />Everything works for me, discs and codes, I don't understand why so many people are complaining.<br />I could play all games stated in this collection without any problems.<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid 1 has to be downloaded and it takes around 700 mbs.<br />The VR Missions also has to be downloaded and it takes around 300 mbs.<br />Metal Gear 1 and 2 can be found inside Metal Gear Solid 3.<br /><br />I would recommend this for all of you who didn't buy the previous HD collection or if you are new into this set of games..<br />If you did buy the HD collection, this would be good if you are a Metal Gear Solid collector.<br /><br />I'm happy with it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series with great characters. You even get a little history lesson from watching!  I can not wait for season four.

B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Well what can I say???  I have been enjoying The Beach Boys for so...so...so many years.  Thank you again for all the great music!!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I judge my movies on one criteria: &#34;Did this movie keep me entertained the entire time I watched it - or did I find myself wondering when it would be over or looking at my watch?&#34;<br /><br />This movie absolutely delivered and kept me entertained the entire time. It felt like a fast moving graphic novel that you just keep turning the pages of.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome free and fun and u should get it plus there is a new theme every month get it
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Sir George Martin is a genius in the studio and this proves it.  A most enjoyable addition to any collection.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Pretty predictable towards the end and a slow start for me. Good book in all. Looking forward to the second
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I found this by mistake and J honestly having a great time with it. I will definitely share with friends and family. My wife will love it. Okay now I am not sure about how many words this review has to be but I am stuck writing until I reach a certain point. I really to get back to work before I get fired. Oh no, this boss just walked in on me typing...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great series. Sylvia Day is an excellent story teller and allows the reader to experience all the &#34;action&#34; as if you are there.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Move over subway surfers you have been beat by this fun game the only problem is sometimes avoiding bombs is the problem because it glitches sometimes and runs directly into the bombs and gets really annoying but that only happened a few times but one of the greatest games I played in my life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I play it every day. I just can not get effect of the game. olive it
B005544TRQ|5.0|Premise makes for constant threat of exposure for the young &#34;lawyer&#34; while acting by all is superb. Hard to stop watching at the end of any episode without calling up the next.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Despicable me is my grandchildren's favorite movie. I have to confess I love it too. So funny. We all watch it together.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|It was  good but it doesn't have good hd or chat and it loads as well as cutting out. Overall it still works
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Very funny movie and a great group of actors.  i Cant wait to see RED 2.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|But one thing bugs the heck out of me. Author keeps bringing up the term democracy. We (usa)do not live in a democracy. The founders of our country feared a true democracy. Example often given: a lynch  mob is a true democracy. You don't want to be in the minority of that group. We live in a representative republic. By definition protects the minority. This is why Egypt failed. For some reason everyone thinks that democracy is the ideal. We push this ideal on these new countries and cause them to do elections before they are ready. and often the bad guys are the most prepared to run for office. But just like communism, no where does democracy work as an effective government. There must be checks and balances. Which don't exist in a true democracy.<br /><br />I wish so bad someone would explain this to our politicians. This author should know this.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I had read the Edgar Rice Burroughs book(s) (along with the Pellucidar series) and I didn't think a movie could capture the mind imagery and the feeling of the series. Boy was I surprised and proved wrong!<br /><br />I actually did get to see this in the theater when it came through. Many didn't.<br /><br />This is really good 'ol fashioned story telling with everything. Action, Adventure, Romance, Humor, amazing effects and characters you care about and can relate to.<br /><br />I absolutely believe that if you watch this movie you will thoroughly enjoy it from start to finish and you will want more. Guaranteed.<br /><br />On top of that it's PG-13 and something the entire family can enjoy!<br /><br />I only wish they'd produce another.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|Its an excellent game for people of all ages and especially good if you want to keep the kids occupied. I also love the color pallet they give you. Its will always hev you wanting to play it over and over again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My mom told me 30 years ago, way before i started reading for enjoyment, that the movie is never as good as the book. So true. I am now trying to convince my son of that fact, but I don't have much faith that he will believe me-- at least not for another 20 years.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The previous version was very concise and easy. This newer version is pathetic. I'll go to another weather app til this is fixed. Shameful to ruin a good app that way!
0812550706|1.0|Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, is a young adult science fiction novel set in a dystopian future about genius children bred to be soldiers. The title character, Ender, goes to Battle School and over time becomes leader of an army waging war against an alien race known as the \\"Buggers\\".  There are numerous reasons why I did not like this novel, these include the main character, Ender; the underlying themes presented by the author, and the story itself.<br />  First of all, Ender appeals mainly to boys who are 10 to 14 years old, specifically, the loner and nerdy type.  Ender is unbelievable and too perfect.  He seems to be inhuman as if he has no faults, in essence boring.  I could not connect with Ender as a person.Ender is also presented as the savior of humanity, which seemed implausible.  Ender does not change or learn anything throughout the story.<br />  Some of the underlying themes that the author presents I felt were disturbing and do not fit in with today's society.  I thought that some of the ideas that he presented were too juvenile.  Also, there was a lot of violence and graphic imagery involving children that I thought was inappropriate and had little to do with the plot.(pubic hair references and naked soapy shower death fight)  The Church of Latter Day Saints heavily influenced the author and he ends the novel with a pro Mormon message.<br /> I feel like there are other works of fiction that tell a similar story, only better, such as 1984 or The Hunger Games.  The story was predictable, boring, and repetitive from the very beginning.  I thought his style, particularly his descriptions of the battle scenes was vague and confusing.  The majority of the other characters were cookie cutter or flat I thought, and they showed little development.  This may be due, in part, to the author's writing style.<br />  There are many reasons that I do not recommend this book.  The protagonist, Ender, I thought was an underwhelming character given the fact he was the \\"savior\\" of the story.  Some of the scenes in the book were completely unnecessary and over the top.  For those who like science fiction, I think there are better options available.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I hope the movie does the book justice, but i don't have high expectations. Directors tend to use focus groups more than considering the authors true intent.
B005721W9O|5.0|I was about five or six when the original \\"Star Trek\\" series was first on television.  I believe that it aired on Sunday nights -- it was so long ago and I was so young that I'm guessing a bit -- and I used to literally race home to watch it.  I was mesmerized.  Naturally, I was too young to get some of the jokes, but no matter.  At that time it was probably the best SciFi show on television.  Ever.<br /><br />And then along came \\"Star Trek:  The Next Generation,\\" or perhaps one of the many other follow-up series to the beloved original.  And I pretty much hated the new series and all others that followed.  The characters were just too mechanical, and the acting was just too lame.  And they were all overly melodramatic junk.  I think that the only good Star Trek was the original, and a movie or two might have been good with the original cast.  But probably the best of them all so far:  \\"Star Trek\\" from 2009 with Chris Pine playing the lead.  He and Zachary Quinto absolutely nailed it, and the rest of the cast wasn't far behind.  I'm looking forward to \\"Star Trek into Darkness\\" when available on streaming in HD.<br /><br />But in reality, this film might be better than all of these shows combined.  As a matter of fact, I think that it is the best SciFi film ever; yeah better than that one or that one.  \\"Star Wars,\\" while being groundbreaking, is a snooze fest compared to this stuff.  (Woody Allen had at least one science fiction parody that was hilarious as well, from what I remember.)  \\"Galaxy Quest\\" makes fun of the original \\"Star Trek\\" but does it nicely.  Tim Allen plays the Captain Kirk character better than William Shatner ever dreamed possible, while Enrico Colantoni is probably the real star.  Mr. Colantoni gives a sublime performance as an overly kind and naïve alien, and he just kills here.<br /><br />What's the theme of the film?  Well, it could be all kinds of things, but how about:  \\"Necessity is the Mother of Invention\\"?  That one will do.  And surprisingly, this film might be the Mother of all SciFi films as well.  Take that, George Lucas!
B001ER4CNY|5.0|Not only do I absolutely LOVE this series, it represents a time when everyone in America could watch decent programming on television. I call it “the golden age of television”, when someone could sit down and enjoy good, wholesome TV programs like I Dream Of Jeannie, and didn’t have to worry about hearing or seeing anything immoral and indecent. I Dream Of Jeannie is truly the kind of series that simply don’t exist anymore.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It;s ok.  I don't get on very often as its hard to get around.  No one to teach me.how to use it
B003UESJF6|1.0|I order megamind and received the megamind button of doom. I want the full move and I got a 15min movie.
B008Y78M60|4.0|Great movie highlighting events following the death and assassination of President Lincoln.  Many of these events are often overlooked and are less well known historical stories and instances.  Great movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is really awesome and creative and great for all ages! i recommend this game to everyone. it is worth the money
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Great book. Full of suspense.I recommended that this book is awesome. Every one should read this book please read it
B00BF11STU|5.0|Great movie- even though the outcome is already known, the build up and lengthy process leading to the conclusion is very intense and interesting.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|The scans are good and easily acquired, but I found no way to specifically save the files under a name of your choice. Unless I simply did not take the time to explore the app thoroughly (which is possible), the only way I found to do so was to email the scan to your device, and then rename the file with a File Manager App. Regardless, it does do good scans.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|This could easily be a 5-star app with a couple of small fixes and tweaks.  A redo button would be nice along with the undo.  Also some stability as far as what information is saved if you accidentally exit the app...Hate losing my newly created art by pressing back or home.  Aside from those few minor gripes, this is a solid, fun app.  Amazing how much time you can spend just doodling with your fingers and then after a few minutes realize you have something pretty impressive with little effort!  Grabbed it as a free app of the day and very glad I did! This app is only limited by your creativity!
B000F7CMQ8|4.0|I saw the original movie on TV. I enjoyed watching it on DVD also. Glad to have it for my collection
0762188618|5.0|i had read this book years ago but it was as good as I remembered.  ken Follet is a master story teller.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Glad I rented versus paying movie cinema prices. It was an interesting to see what happened once hansel and gretel grew up.
B003BVFZ4Q|4.0|How can a writer as prolific and successful as SK not have some darn good advice?  Only one thing I didn't agree with - that good writers can't learn to be great writers - other then this, On Writing is a terrific book and a must for anyone who is serious about the craft.
B005U9QJY2|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid, and I love it as an adult.  My kids also seemed to enjoy it.
006178480X|2.0|2 stars instead of one because the author had the good sense to make the villain a North Korean instead of a deranged Muslum screaming Ali Akbar. Aside from that this is a one star skimmer you can read in 1 hour on the beach if you don't fall asleep. Unfortunately, there are no zombies or vampires and not much sex. Just a lot of cut-out cartoon characters and boring cereal box science. I think this was written by a 14 year old kid. You won't care how the book ends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|At first I thought that the game was going to be boring but then I started playing it and I'm like wow this is the best game I've ever played
B00COMLLX2|4.0|This was fun to play but it could have a little less of the same Colorado. It was hard to follow the ball at times. I enjoy pinball in real life and this is somewhat close to the real thing.
B0080GUX2Q|4.0|It's always great to read a book that confirms your ideas - and when it's written, so that you most of the time just sit there laughing out loud - what's not to like?<br />Oliver Burkeman is a great writer and this book is more like a real book than his first that suffered from the confusion that most collections of blogposts do. The Antidote is a more coherent book - but this also has its problems.<br />Over time it looses some of its momentum and its ironic humor. This is of course necessary to a certain extent, as he wishes not only to critizise Positive Thinking and self help litterature, but to present a solution for the rest of us.<br />This doesn't mean that you shouldn't read it - please do! Everybody should (especially my boss!!)- I just can't give it five stars.<br />So read the book and memento mori!
B0002HN14I|5.0|I suppose full disclosure requires that I confess to being a fan of Hilary Hahn. Not only is she a technical virtuoso, but she has a feeling for music than many musicians lack. When she takes on a piece of music, it flows out of her instrument. She make is sound so effortless that I almost forget that the reason I gave up violin was that it was so #$%$### difficult! (For me, anyway.)<br /><br />If there is anything to complain about regarding this recording, it is that the engineers got a little happy with the microphones. It almost sounds as if every instrument in the orchestra was close-miked. I know that isn't likely, but the orchestra lacked the warmth and smoothness that the solo violin had. However, that was a subtle thing and perhaps due as much to my sound system as the recording engineers. The performance of the orchestra was outstanding.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun!!! if you like despicable me and temple run you will love this game! there are fun power ups and even things from the movie. I have a kindle and it hasn't been in the app store when o checked again it was there!!!! yipee!!!:)
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A story that tugs at your emotions and keeps you turning the pages. The enjoyment will be compounded for anyone who is also British or who has lived in Britain and knows the highways and byways that Harold plods on as he weaves his way North.
0547564651|4.0|Definitely recommend this book. Seriously, should be a reading requirement for all teachers, parents, and anyone working with kids. Pretty fast read not too complex writing style. A lot of examples.<br /><br />Was delivered on time and in perfect condition.
B00BQOC4X0|5.0|In these times of consumption of goods and the degrading of our environment I would suggest that this is a must read.
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|We ordered this movie for our kids to watch on a rainy day.  It's a little preachy and predictable, but will span the time on a rainy day.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is pretty fun.  You can spend money on it, but I just wait for more coins to add up and go back to it later.  You win a lot more on this app than you would at a real coin dozer!!!!!  (I should go and try a real one again now that I've had time to practice on my Kindle Fire!!!)
B00CKOQC9C|1.0|Worst book ever... don't read this u will want to burn the book. U will hate this book don't read it
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This new version of temple run was way better than the original. But it crashed on my kindle making it so that I couldn't play. I reluctantly deleted the app and redownloaded it. However after a few weeks it happened again. This happened to a few of my friends too. All of this not have happened to you but it might so I'm warning you.
B00AVIQPJQ|5.0|This one very good movie with a bizzare twist and a very bright starlet in Natalie Portman at the time, and she just stole this movie.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|The movie is cute plus it includes several fun bonus features that are totally worth while and the user-submitted stop-action videos are all top notch.
B0024CEY36|5.0|As always, a real page turner.  Love it.  He's the only author I read over and over again.  Recommend for anyone who loves historical novels.
B004HY9NKI|5.0|Best cutt'em up movie of all time, with one hell of a cast and Lindsey Lohan is actually a very healthy girl.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|I love The Big Bang Theory and enjoyed the third season. I like that it ends with a story line that picks up at the start of season 4.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|Despite what the so called experts say.... THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME... just sayin...everything you could ever ask for in a sci/war/action move is here!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I think the character of Gideon Cross is the perfect<br />blend of strong and loving.  This series of books keeps<br />my attention and leaves me wanting more...which the<br />author clearly intended by leaving us hanging in this one.
1781162646|5.0|Awesome book, but wouldn't expect anything different from one of the best!!!  If you're a Stephen King fan like me you will enjoy this book!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the Crossfire novels! Way better than 50! These two's story keeps getting better and better. I have to agree with some other reviewers though, I though this was the last book. I am happy to hear there will be another one. Yet I have heard that their could be a total of five. Ms. Day I hope it's not true! I can't wait that long to see how Gideon and Eva's story ends!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It was fantastic ! I love Gideon ! Can't wait for the next one ! Gideon says he's not romantic .. I beg to differ ! If romance and strong men are what your looking for this book has it ! Did I mention HOT ! Wow ! Sexy and dangerous ...
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was gripping for the 2/3 rds in the end the story lost its tempo and sense of direction. There are too many characters in the end to dilute the powerful message.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book! It was a romance but from a man's point of view. It was funny, sweet and sexy as hell! I literally could not stop reading it!
052118939X|5.0|I love it, it's really necessary! If you are looking for a student book, this is the one! If you are a teacher, that's the way to improve your English!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game really makes you think. Love the challenging levels! It's very addicting but so much fun! I would recommend it
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Once I got it installed again I is better than before. It is easier to choose cities to add, and check weather anywhere.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Very informative and educational- an entirely new perspective for me at least, on why and how people are the size and weight they are; knowing the reason is very helpful in knowing how to rectify ones problems with overweight.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My aspie kid who normally doesn't like any sort of animated movie normally loved this one! He actually wants to see the sequel.
B005721W9O|5.0|This is an awesome movie for those who love speculative fiction and those who just like a good, funny movie. It's clever, with witty humor, action scenes, and, at the risk of being redundant, great puns! With a well developed plot and lovable characters, this is a must-see for all ages. Certainly a classic.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it is fun and challenging you its not your normal &quot; find it &quot; game its find it and use everything you find to finish the puzzle
B004UID2LC|1.0|Had this app for years, with each update it has gotten worse, now I can no longer download videos or mp3 format files...before the updates it was working fine..I don't know what went wrong can someone please fix it?
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed reading &#34;Defending Jacob&#34;, but throughout the book I kept thinking what if this was my child.  How would I handle this and how could I get through the ordeal if it was my own child?  It is a real thought provoking book to read.  The end of the book really provides a real twist to the story.
B00CATSONE|2.0|Tesla was an interesting man, and this short book summarises his life, but gives no analysis of the things that went wrong and the things that he got very wrong, the things that he got very right and the apparent commercial frauds perpetrated on him. Its a short book that might be useful for someone writing an essay under time pressure, but gives no insight to one of the great pioneers of electronics.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie is great on many levels. Ben Affleck is at his best. All the characters are so well acted and written. I loved the look and feel of the movie as well as the story itself. Lots of fun to watch, and you get a great perspective on history as well.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|For a novel, it seemed more like non-fiction. Page-turning, insightful, and unabashedly self-indulgent on the author's part. Clearly displays how race is the BURDEN  for all of us, with many of us resorting to, or suffering from dissociative coping to conquer it. A good read for all Americans, a must read for African-Americans, Americanahs, and the West African petite bourgeoisie.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show is like a modern day X-files. It keep you going and guessing what is going to happen next.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|nice app I like how it plays and the mechanics of it all. good graphics and it is quite enjoyable
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is awesome best game ever in the world if I had to recommend a game other would be hill climb racing
B00APACSJG|5.0|Kept me involved and intrigued at the same time. Good to see Miles has not lost his touch. Looking forward to more.
1400052181|5.0|Absolutely could not put this down.  Not only an interesting tale from a medical and ethical standpoint, but clearly the book that this author has been yearning to write for years.  Her passion and empathy for not only HeLa, but for the individuals she met and became friends with shine from every page.  Just amazing - thoughtful and compassionate.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|I am having a blast with this app. I love it. I made my first poster and posted it on Facebook with tags. I am defiantly keeping this app
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think its fun but the costumes are to expensive they should at least be thaw same price as the items such as the banana splitter.
B0091REZMW|5.0|like one review I have been playing this game for a while and spent no money cause I use patience. its a fun game.
1575666286|5.0|Almost everyone has some type of eating issue - whether it's too time consuming to cook or just easier to stop in at the local fast food joint.  Beware though, what was devised to make tobacco addictive is being collaborated now into our foods; therefore, more and more people are becoming not only obese, but ill within diabetes and cancer.  Back to nature is the driving force with the Gerson Therapy.  Using nature's gift of organic foods to eat, juices of same and taking the body back to it's normal state is the mission of the Gersin Therapy.  Thousands have benefitted from this,  being on death's door upon arrival at their clinic/s, to walk out after a relatively short time, in remission or cured.<br /><br />Five stars is a no option choice.  The entire population needs to know about this and even begin simple changes in the home.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though there is so much violence I enjoyed this book immensely. I read the entire thing non-stop.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it forces the reader to consider the fundamental parameters of human and societal development. The fundamental premise is that all people are created equal but the land where they live is not.  Very thought provoking.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game. Love the one touch option on the cards. Fun,easy and addictive. I play everynight to unwind before falling asleep.
B003U6BE8I|1.0|Books were good, movie was terrible.  The acting was awkward, it didn't even come close to the story line of the book, and the effects left little to be desired.  There, is that 20 words Amazon?
B004I744AS|5.0|Good range of definitions for many words. Variations in pronounciation is also nice to know. In some cases it borders on an encyclopedia in information.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game absolutely sucked. The pics and the logo pic makes you think it's really cool but it's hard to control, you have to pay to get anything, and the graphics are HORRIBLE. DONT GET IT. If you want a good salon game, get Toca Hair Salon. It doesn't cost very much and if you pay once you get everything. Plus, you can use Amazon Coins to buy it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Hard to get into then slowly got interested. The middle was better but I didn't like the ending. They were both dysfunctional people.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|nice movie was bought for a gift and my son is very happy with it he says it works well every time
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I loved this book.  It was extremely well-written.  The overall plot that connects all of the stories in this series is very well-organized and developed.  Nalini Singh's skill in developing her characters is to be admired.  Her writing style is perfect.  Her attention to detail is amazing.  This book was a work of art and a great pleasure to read.
B0018BB21G|5.0|Highly recommend this seller who has this product at a very good price. I am very happy with the whole sale, shipping and product.  It has all the great songs from the Moodys very first album. A+
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Finally after 4 years of using my old gigabyte mouse, I decided to upgrade. From the Description and price I thought I would try it out. Overall its a good mouse, my only problems with it are:<br />-The position of the scroll wheel, this is not a big issue but after a long time with another mouse its just taking a bit of adjusting to.<br />-I'm having issues when I open the software to program the mouse it resets my old settings automatically.<br />-Two minor issues, changing the color in the settings only affects the anker logo not the entire mouse and I wish I could add a little more weight to it.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this to someone that is on a budget because it is a great mouse for the price.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game, it is calming to see the fish swim.  I love getting the new fish and seeing what type of fish they are.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This was a five-star app for my Kindle Fire until the July 2013 automatic update, at which point it became a one-star (because there isn't a zero-star).  The previous version was beautiful.  When I opened it, I saw all the current information for my location and the additional information was simple to access. Now, I get whatever full-screen picture they want to show me (Bing anyone?), some advertisements, a \\"points\\" thing, and a temperature. There is some text that might be more weather information, but it is nearly impossible to read - obscured by the new photo.  To view more current data, you have to tap the temperature. (The extra tap is really unnecessary, a big step backwards!) Even then, some of the data is missing. The points thing is really unclear and they give you a big button to sign up for whatever it is, but backing out of the process is not as intuitive.  I'm very disappointed.  In fact, I've loaded WeatherBug and I'm also going to consider Accuweather.  They had a good thing but ruined it in the name of progress.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|This was a good book. We listened to this book while we drove<br /> to Texas which took 19 hours. This book kept me wondering what else can happen to a human being who is highly gifted and intelligent.<br />I learned so much about the possible ways the media, police and government could be cruel and work to get things working their way.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I seriously love this game! Everyone should get it :) it's no predictable which makes it so fun to play
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|There are a lot of similarities in the story line with this series and the 50 Shades series, but this one is much better in my opinion.  The characters are more believable, the plot makes more sense.  There is more to the story than just the 2 main characters.  Good read - can't wait for the next one!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|If you learn how. To work it its fine, I did expect more I use it but not that much
B00B7Y0206|1.0|WHY DO YOU HAVE TOO BY THE UPGRADE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY WATCH A VIDEO WITHOUT ADDS!! I WOULD REGIMEN THAT YOU GUYS EITHER MAKE A.BETTER APP OR JUST SHUT THE APP DOWN BECAUSE ITS WORTHLESS!!! I'M DELETING THIS APP FOR GOOD Y'ALL REALLY DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!
B0092S4WLY|2.0|Now What??? No instructions on how to play. Perhaps a hint or cheat sheet. I have'nt been able to get on the elevator.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the book and it was fairly good. My son however felt it was awesome<br />We compared and we both agree this book fit the young people.<br /> he felt the book would  motivate younger people to read and help visual
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Because this show is mainly on PBS it is so hard to find access to. I was so stoked when I saw it on Amazon Prime!
B00AYQNOFI|5.0|Technically is at the top. Beautiful and powerful photography. The script very powerful blend of contrasts without being graphically gory. Very clinical and truthful, without one single word. Bravo to the cast!!!!
0525952926|5.0|love this effing book. Everything I could possibly want Ina novel. well-balanced themes characters, vocabulary, and excitement. definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a good read after reading fall of giants
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I've been searching for quite a while for a mistery game and definetely hit the jackpot with this one. The plot keeps you on your nerves making it not want to leave the game until the mistery is solved. Definitely looking forward to the sequel.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is SO much funner than the 1st one.  The special effects are great making you feel like you are really in the game.  I love riding in the cart.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I can read with Kindle using my Galaxy S3. When you adjust the zoom, the number of pages is adjusted accordingly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game its very hard to describe it. It's so fun and sometimes funny subunits my favourite game to play
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD and just received the fastest version.  WATCH OUT  THEY ADDED ADS AND the forecast and day are on top of each other.  IT'S A MESS.  I'm going to use Accuweather.
0399160450|1.0|Let me put this into perspective right off the bat. In the climactic chapter, in the most important paragraph, in the final sentence (a whopping 812 pages into this quagmire), the word \\"desperate\\" is spelled \\"desparate.\\" Indeed, I'm seeing the squiggly red line under the word now. I thought maybe it was some kind of intelligence term, given all the abbreviations and fancy lingo that pepper this book. But when I went to webster-dictionary.org, I received the simple verbiage: \\"desparate not found in dictionary.\\" I know authors/editors miss words, but this is Tom Clancy's latest Jack Ryan for heaven's sake! And he can't even spell desperate! Then again, it is more than one syllable, so let's forgive them.<br /><br />I'm not an expert on the Jack Ryan universe at all, indeed, this is the first Clancy book I have completed, but I suspect fans of the Jack Ryan series would be flabbergasted by how poor this is. For one thing, it's clearly not Clancy in charge (was he ever?). Either this lower font name of Mark Greaney spent his time and energy hammering out this thing or another ghost from the Clancy syndicate. Another irritation that I couldn't ignore: if this \\"novel\\" takes place in present day, how is Jack Ryan, Sr (Threat Vector focuses on his son, Junior) still the president of the US? I thought he became president more than 15 years ago in Executive Orders? Was the 22nd Amendment overturned?<br /><br />At any rate, the cyberwarfare plot detailing China's attempt to take down the US with some Russian aid had its page turner moments, mostly because it was easy action and only about ten words a line. But I fear those who read this and its hulking 830 page nonsense consider this literature and read nothing else. I also fear Clancy/Greaney/ghost have read way too much latter day Bob Woodward, as the White House scenes feel way too much ripped off from Bush White House conversations. Maybe in the next one Ryan goes to work for the Washington Post and they remake All the President's Men.sident's Men.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This a bomb ass game yall be able to play with friends and s*** hell yea my miqqas them cards be bomb with they colors
0618871713|5.0|Haven't read the book yet, but it arrived promptly, in excellent condition, and best of all, its price was so low, it seemed like as though it were almost free!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This is one of those \\"kids movies\\" that is also enjoyable for parents. Very funny with good life lessons for the kids.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game is awesome! I like this game because I love horses. Thanks u!!!!! Love this game so much!!!!
B001B67VR2|5.0|I've been wanting this CD for years now, but I've been forced to put it aside and wait and wait and wait because other things (more important things) I had to put my money towards at the time. When I finally scooped up some extra cash I got the digital download of the album for my Kindle Fire HD and I love it. I've mixed it it with old playlists and I love rockin out and dancing to songs like Umbrella, Don't Stop The Music, Breakin' Dishes and Shut Up & Drive. It's great for anyone but I highly recommend it to anyone late teens and all of twenties as the theme of the CD screams rebellion. It's a lot of fun to listen to and jam to and if you are a good girl gone bad or a good girl lookin to go bad, this CD might just help. Just don't shoot anyone like one song's theme is, k?<br />Xo
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game. It makes you really think where things could be hide. It's fun to get friends and family involved.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks if you do not have buy it is not a waste of time God dang buy it
B00CH26TL8|3.0|It's a fun game, but you can't use the magic potions or even get any unless you pay. And once you get to about level 8/150 or so it starts getting hard to match up bubbles. Which is kinda a rip off. The first few levels are okay but I'm extremely glad this was free and wasn't worth anything. It's defiantly not a fave.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|I have a paid premium subscription to SKY.FM and DI.FM (who this is, same folks for both).<br /><br />I like supporting DI/SKY.FM and am hoping they continue to prosper. I know there are many music sources out there (many free) but I like being able to 'pick it' and forget it. IMO too much time is needed to 'fiddle' with Pandora (I tried them for a paid year, but came back and renewed my DI account the very next year).<br /><br />GRANTED you can get very fussy and choose an exact artist with many services, but I have found when I have it playing in the background the 'folks' who DJ/choose the music at DI/SKY.FM do a superb job and I am never disappointed. What used to drive me nuts was being up on a ladder/scaffolding and have Pandora play something I detested and had not 'Thumbed down\\" and unless I came down and changed it, it would be annoying.<br /><br />Another thing I totally missed. I paid for TWO DI accounts a few years back. I paid for one of my own, and I bought one for my Mom in Law in the UK. When I saw Pandora come in cheaper and seem 'so good' I tried it out. Guess what, NO Pandora in the UK. Apparently DI/SKY is everywhere or Europe based so I did not realize it was the perfect setup for my situation. Not a huge deal...<br /><br />So I forget when my DI/SKY.FM premium membership renews but I will continue to buy/support them as they do a GREAT job, and I enjoy the perks (NO ADS, priority to channels when it is busy, and higher fidelity/streaming).<br /><br />Read up on their site, they are not a huge venture capital company, they are quite the opposite and when I read up I knew that was what I wanted.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, hours of fun. I like that it's fast paced. The graphics are great and the characters are funny.
B005I0DLXK|3.0|Originally I only knew a couple songs on Loud i.e. Only Girl, S&M, California King Bed, etc, and I liked them so I thought, why not buy all of it and listen to all of it? It's good, it really is, it one of her better albums but it's still not my full cup of tea. However with that being said, anyone who likes Hip Hop, Reggae or Rock should give this a try, it has a little of all it in it. Xo
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read all of Colleen's books and she has never disappointed me.  I just re-read this to prepare for Losing Hope.  She is a wonderful author and I will buy any book she writes! :)
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Animated actions of the different types of animals are cute. Nice variety of available actions. A caution, though. It's easy to spend peanuts by accident, as there's no intermediate &quot;Are you sure?&quot;  step.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is one of the best shows on television, now that Damages is gone. And if you haven't seen it... what are you waiting for??
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|This is a pretty good game. It rocks that it is free! I highly recommend it. As you finish reading this review, you will fall into a deeeep sleep and your fingers will automatically get the game. No need to thank me, heeheeehee...
B000002W9Q|5.0|I am a huge fan of the movie and I am very happy with the song selection of the CD.
B00A0SICYI|5.0|Excellent quality in HD. This brought back some good ole days with the family. I would recommend this for any family night.
B00BMUVUZG|3.0|in fact I wonder if John Grisham has a ghost writer writing for him<br /><br />the quality of his books has gone done a lot in my estimation
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Truly an epic game play it all the time on my phone (android razor 1Gen) and on my kindle fire.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|yes I was quite disappointed with Clifton Chronicles 3<br /><br />I did not like the role of Giles Barrington - either his personality or his involvement in politics<br /><br />I was quite bored ready that part (which was a lot)<br /><br />However I loved his brother (I cannot remember his name just now) but I was quite horrified that he died in the end and I was even<br />more horrified to find out that Chronicles 4 + 5 have not been written as yet.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Trying to get caught up with this series before the next season begins.  It's so addicting, I'm having no problem watching this as fast as I can.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|I would write and rate the same for Clifton Chronicles 1<br /><br />I am running out of words to write for you
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Love this series.  I can't wait to watch the next episode.  Anxious to finish watching this before the next season begins.
B003FFEX8C|5.0|This movie was also very exciting.  My son loved looking at Halle Berry and felt she was very very sexy.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I searched for a video. When I clicked on it,the app stopped. Tried many times. Still stopped. These people are full of it when they say this app works. Bunch of bullcrap.
B00BURWSHA|5.0|This cd is great and one I recomend others buying if they like good hard rock music. Good cover of zeppelins kashmir
B000002LFZ|5.0|This  has most of the best Fleetwood Mac songs I remembered. The price compared to most other cd's is very low. The music is terrific . AND you get an auto rip copy sitting in the cloud you can tap into any time you want  !
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very responsive. I love not having to drag the cards . Especially like the  auto-complete feature. .  Especially like the auto-complete feature when you win.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this daily. I have received positive comments from everyone who has heard this. My 5 year old granddaughter wants it on her Mommy's Kindle, the furniture delivery man is going to get it for his 7 month old son. I use several sounds at the same time and the effect is awesome. Try Flute, Thunder, Ocean &amp; Wind. Sometimes I add wind chimes. I think you will like it too. There are so many sounds, you will never get tired of your options.
