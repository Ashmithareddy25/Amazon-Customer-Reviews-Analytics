B002Q7JYPC|5.0|I never tired of listening to this CD. From the vocals to the guitar work to the variation in styles and tunes, this one has it all. I've been an Eagles fan since the beginning and, for me, this one is right up there with the best of their work.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|Darren Aronofsky certainly knows how to make dark psychological dramas: \\"The Wrestler\\" and \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" were both gritty, disturbing films that seemed almost like documentaries. Aronofsky typically gets stellar performances from his Actors and \\"Black Swan\\" is no exception. Natalie Portman's performance as the fragile ballerina who descends into madness is wonderfully dark. Winona Ryder's brief role as an aging, broken ballerina is outstanding as well. But the film founders about half way through and suddenly becomes twisted, dizzying, and hard to follow. The backstories of a carping \\"Mommie Dearest\\" and an \\"All About Eve\\" understudy are cliched and add detract from the film's success. But stay with it if you can and the ending is spectacularly twisted.
B0031ESIZQ|4.0|my sons 8 & 9 enjoy this game. They especially enjoy downloading others rollercoasters & uploading and modifying them. I recommend it.
0375413405|5.0|My wife has been on the hunt for a hard-bound copy for quite awhile.  She is very pleased to get a copy in her possession.  It holds special meaning for her, for having had the opportunity to meet and speak with Julia Child, in person, as a student at Johnson and Wales University. The quality and condition were exactly as described.
1439102724|1.0|...because I'd want my money back.  I borrowed this from the library.  It was an easy/fast read but I found the way Christians are portrayed to be offensive.  I attend an Evangelical Christian church and I don't know ANYONE even remotely like the pastor, lawyer, and protesters (with the vulgar signs) from the story.   Just because someone goes to an Evangelical church doesn't make them a nut job. Of course, those are the type we HEAR about because they make the headlines and get people talking... but they're NOT the majority by any means.     I found this passage, written from Zoe's perspective... \\"but I couldn't see past a woman who, in this day and age, actually waited for her husband to come home from work so that she could ask him about his day and feed him a meal.  Max used to say we should go out shopping, or to lunch, get to know each other - but I figured we'd run out of things to talk about before we'd backed out of her driveway\\" (p 410).    I may be in the minority but I DO stay at home with my children, and yes I DO cook meals for my husband.  I DO ask him about his day when he comes home from work.  Zoe's comments, basically dismissing this lady (her ex-sister-in-law Liddie), as if Liddie would have absolutely nothing interesting to say, well it's pretty judgmental.  And insulting to those of us who care about being home and taking care of our families.  I found myself wondering why I was reading a book where the main character would so obviously think I'm an idiot not worth the time to talk to.    ***Spoilers***    I saw the ending a mile away; I knew Max would win the case but hand over the embryos, I knew Lucy would be the Pastor's daughter.  Very, very obvious.  I didn't find the love affair between Zoe and Vanessa to be believable or authentic.  It felt forced and Vanessa particularly was unlikeable and seemed always ready to attack anyone standing nearby.  She was very harsh with little softness.  I don't feel like Zoe's character was developed andit felt like we never really \\"knew\\" her.  The only character I was somewhat interested in was Liddie, who obviously harbored her own secrets.    ***End of Spoilers***    I really enjoyed many of the author's other books.. Plain Truth was fantastic.  This book is lame.  It would be far more compelling and interesting if it didn't alienate readers by catering to stereotypes.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|Paul Simon has always had an uncanny ability to bend a line ever so subtly and make it ache. Make you ache and yearn right along with it.  Not the strongest voice.  Not the most intricate of guitar players, yet always distinct in both ways.  His ability to wring so much meaning and so many levels out of those poetic phrases is unmatched, really.<br /><br />This album is no different.  As many have said already, it is definitely his best since Graceland, and in some ways better.  Simon, like Dylan, and Neil Young, has aged so well.  We live in a society that worships youth, yet the best musicians don't really hit their stride for years.  That's what I think about when I hear this album.  There is a new dimension of wisdom and beauty and sweet surrender wrapped around all of these tracks.  He still turns a phrase like it's important; like he really means it.  The fans will instantly get it.  For the newcomer to his music, this album is good enough to stand as an impressive gateway into all of his other iconic tunes.  If someone were to start here, they would come out a fan in the end.  Great, great stuff.<br /><br />Chris Bowen<br />[[ASIN:B004C43I22 Our Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom]]
B004UXXVQS|5.0|Awesome album.  I like it more and more as I listen to it.  Whenever songs sound better the 5th and 10th time then I know the album is real good and this is one does that for me.  Every song is great so buying the album is the way to go.  I am a big Foo fan and really like all of their albums....this may be their best yet...it is a tough call though.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I had the chance to watch it in 3D. Awesome effects, sound, flying doesn't look fake. I've watched a couple of movies in 3D, this is by far the best one. Good performance by the cast, mild humor and that was good. I didn't like the silly humor in Iron Man 2. Stan Lee is there, and there's a very cool unexpected cameo by a fellow avenger.    I'm not a Thor fan, but I do know something about the comic. This was a very well made adaptation. The movie made it here April 28th so I had to go see it. The battles are awesome, the relation between Odin and Thor was well depicted. I really think they really cared about this project.    If you have the chance watch it in 3D. Thor was awesome, let's see how Capatain America turns out. I couldn't see the scene after the credits, they stopped when the credits were rolling. There's a cool song during the credits. The scene is already in youtube...it's no big deal.      Go watch it and enjoy!
B003WKOU0G|3.0|It was my turn to choose a movie. I dont know anything about movies. I had to choose. I chose this Babies thing. In a nutshell its about babies. Not how they are made, how they are raised, what they are doing here. It just about them. They dont have speaking parts so its hard to understand them sometimes. If you love babies, you will like this movie. If you just like babies pretty good, you might make a choice different from me. I liked this movie, but I wouldnt watch it again, especially in mixed company, those who like babies mixed with those who dont so much. For the volume of babies this movie has in it, I give it high marks.
B003RCJTVY|2.0|Though ultimately there is a level of humor and cleverness, keep in mind this was written in an age when authors were paid by the word and used very, very many of them to say as little as possible.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Diana fights against her magical nature, not really understanding the reasons why. The tall, dark and handsome stranger she meets helps her unravel the secrets. It's a good love story, full of interesting characters and interesting historical and scientific references. However, it was hard to really like the main characters as much as you would want to, Diana is always collapsing from something or the other or declaring something or the other way too dramatically and it is difficult to figure out why anyone would like Matthew, much less follow him without reservation. he is a bit too taken with himself and humorless to really be my kind of hero.  With all that said, the story and supporting characters make up for it and make it very likely I will purchase the next book in this series when it comes out, which it will given the very nicely done cliffhanger at the end.
0375507256|4.0|This novel is composed of six self-contained but loosely related stories.The stories are linked in different ways such as where a character in one story is reading a book composed of the previous story. It is a literary device I haven't seen before and it works for the most part, though it feels a bit forced on a couple of occasions. They also share similar ideas, themes, and scenarios. For example, in several of the stories the main protagonist is imprisoned against his/her will. It is a common fear well represented in different ways here, from an older - but still working - man being forcibly kept in a retirement home to the genetically-engineered fast food server getting arrested for her revolutionary ideas. Each one is told from the point of view of a different character.    The stories progress over time, from the first story set in the 19th century to the last story set in some post-apocalyptic distant future. Along the way mankind makes advances but as is often the case these advances come at a cost. This is seen from the start where natives on faraway islands suffer at the hands of foreign conquerors, to a future where the government is run as a corporation and an entire race of beings are genetically created to serve. Ultimately, the cost is civilization itself, as in the final story introduced where mankind has reverted to living in tribes, largely with little or no technology. The progression is reminiscent of \\"The Time Machine\\" and many other stories.    What I found most interesting about the book was how each story reads almost like an entirely different novel with varying writing styles and genres. All but one leaves you with a cliffhanger that is eventually resolved when the story is picked up again later. My personal favorite was \\"An Orison of Sonmi~451\\", a futuristic tale in which society is ruled by a \\"corpocracy\\" and genetically engineered clones are used to serve humans. One could easily categorize it as science fiction. Other genres representedinclude mystery and adventure. While I enjoyed some stories more than others, I didn't find any of them boring at all.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|Brilliant CD with a potential hit for every song. I loved the vocals, the arrangements, the harmonies, and the instrumentation.  My favorite song has got to be Runaway. It has a verse, a chorus, and a bridge and Adam Levine sounds so flexible with his voice  I Can't Lie is an infectious song that I sometimes couldn't get out of my head. Again, great vocals.  Nice tune.  Out of Good-byes, basically a duet with the female of the group, Lady Antebellum (I don't know too much about that group), but great harmonies and melancholy feel to it make this a winner.  My least favorite song is the title song, Hands All Over. It's not a bad song but it just didn't grab me like the other songs.  Misery, one of the hits, from the CD has been covered by The Warblers on Glee. I like Glee's version, but the original is better.  You're just a fantasy girl in a fantasy world are the lyrics to Stutter  Get Back in My Life is a dance worthy song  Just a Feeling is about a relationship that's not working so tender.  I just couldn't help myself sing along with oooh what ya gonna do on Last Chance  Never Gonna Leave This Bed is another hit on their CD  There are some acoustic versions of a couple of the songs with a different kind of feel  I'm usually picky about my music but I bought this after only hearing Misery and from another of their CDs (Songs About Jane) This Love  Some of the songs I felt like I had heard before and maybe I did.  Mutt Lange, Shania Twain's former partner and husband, produced this CD and I can definitely see traces of his influence on this. I love Shania Twain's music so I also loved this.
B001QOGYBI|1.0|This movie was bad, boring and highly unentertaining. I bought two DVD's, one for myself and one for my grandson. I took the unopenned one back, wish I could have returned both.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|They don`t make movies like this anymore .If you watched or liked \\"Princess bride\\" you'll absolutely love this one coming from UK but with american accents.Full family entertainment including magic,pirate,witches. Great visuals,beautiful transfer for bluray that fill HD screen. Absolute gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer .Must watch.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Plex allows me to stream media to my EVO and looks great as well.  The developers are always working to improve the app.  It was well worth the purchase.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I never played resident evil game and not a fan of it by any means.Movie Resident evil is thriller not horror,not single scare was created by gore or amputations that was good for a mass appeal.So far its the best 3D movie i watched in theater and Home. it share same camera technology as used by James Cameron.Resident evil makes you realise that you are watching 3d version by intermittenly rotating caremas,gun shots or debris throwing towards you.Many people `ll hate it but they are mostly the ones who didn`t invest in 3D tech but those who did`ll mostly like it.There is more feel and involvement in movie even if it is at sake of wearing big glasses.This movie delivers it all and makes it best movie so far to show off your 3D home theater.Its not like Movie UP (Great movie for 2D viewing)and many others who are great for viewing in 2D but why 3D? You are carrying burden of glasses whole time for basically nothing.These cheap tactics to make quick bucks for studios in theater are not helpful for 3D adopters of present or future.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I found the middle of this book wholly unputdownable. Fast-paced, intriguing, violent. But wow, what an underwhelming ending. It seems as though the author gave up. After the conclusion, I'm concerned this trilogy is transitioning into a full blown Twilight-esque love story - not my genre of preference, to say the least. While I envisioned burning through the trilogy in record time, I now am unsure whether I will continue onto Catching Fire. That is all.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|So much has already been said about this classic, what's one more description of the plot, etc. going to do?  I just want to give my take on this classic...<br /><br />I'm a fan of classic movies.  I also like movies that are a little \\"offbeat\\".  Breakfast At Tiffany's (1961) is one of those movies and is one of the best romantic comedies ever made.  Audrey Hepburn's character Holly Golightly is one of the most memorable and recognizable characters in movie history.  When most people think of Audrey Hepburn, they think of the cheerful, stylish, and eccentric Holly Golightly.  This movie also stars George Peppard, Martin Balsam, Buddy Ebsen, Patricia Neal, and Mickey Rooney.  Hepburn's performance was outstanding.<br /><br />Much has been said over the years about Mickey Rooney's character, Mr. Yunioshi.  Is it offensive?  Sure, but the most important thing is to just realize that this movie came out only a decade and a half after World War II.  Society thought a certain way back then.<br /><br />Henry Mancini's score won him both an Academy Award and a Grammy, and the song \\"Moon River\\" won him and Johnny Mercer an Academy Award for Best Song.  The song was actually sung by Audrey Hepburn for the movie (dubbed in).  She actually played guitar, also.<br /><br />The picture clarity of this 2-DVD set is superb.  For a 50-year-old movie, it looks like it came out yesterday.  This DVD set is loaded with extras, including commentary, features on Henry Mancini, the character of Mr. Yunioshi, the making of the movie, the style of Audrey Hepburn, the original theatrical trailer, and more.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie if you're into classic movies.
1582701709|5.0|It all makes sense.  How to manifest it is now the challenge.  I have given several copies as gifts.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|This is am amazing album. Had to wait nearly a month after pre-ordering it but it was all worth it. The sound is a little different from their earlier stuff, but you won't be disappointed. Now all that's left is to wait for Within Temptation to come to CA. They were last here 4 years ago so I guess it might be a long wait.

160059672X|5.0|I have to admit that I bought this book simply because it's Sherri Serafini's. Sherri's beadwork can only be considered as works of art. They are truely inspiring, making me want to get out my beads and close out the world for a while. The patterns in this book are easy to understand and make up easily. I encourage you to purchase this book if you want to be inspired~
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I purchased this on Pre Order, thought it would have arrived sooner but I believe it was due to weather conditions so no big deal there, love getting blu ray, dvd, and digital copy for a great price!!!
B0035J6TAI|5.0|I've been a fan of Peter Gabriel for a long time and when I came across this CD I was thrilled. I usually do not like \\"covers\\" because I can always hear how the song is \\"supposed\\" to be in my head while the cover is playing and it's unnerving. Since I'm luckily unfamiliar with the tunes on this CD, I felt like I was experiencing new Gabriel music and not recreations of other's work. While I do understand someone else wrote these songs, I think Gabriel brings so much of his own style to these songs that they are an original experience when you hear them here.     I've read complaints that the CD sounds like a funeral dirge, but I disagree. I think a primary aspect of Gabriel's style is emotion, and with each of these songs he's perfected the art of feeling the intention of the song when hearing his renditions. If they don't move you, you might not be \\"getting it\\" so to speak.     I love the first track, a remake of 'Heroes' (originally by David Bowie)and 'My Body is a Cage' (originally by Arcade Fire); and even though I started out as not a fan of 'The Book of Love' (The Magnetic Fields) and 'The Power of the Heart' (Lou Reed) the more I listen to the tracks the more I enjoy them. I guess that's the true testament of Gabriel's musical ability, he grows on you ;)     Overall, I think that if you like Gabriel's songs like: 'Here Comes the Flood' and 'Mercy Street' (both of which I think are emotional songs) then you'll probably enjoy this CD.
0316098337|4.0|Emma Donoghue's \\"Room\\" is the story of five year old Jack and his mother, Ma.  Ma was kidnapped when she was 19 years old and held by a man in a shed behind his house.  The man raped Ma, impregnating her.  After her first baby dies, she becomes pregnant again, and gives birth, alone, to Jack.  To survive she teaches Jack that Room is the only world, and that the rest of the world, as they see it on TV, is fake.  When Jack and Ma escape, Jack has a difficult transition.  Will he make it on the outside, or will he be haunted by Room.<br /><br />This is a very powerful novel.  It not only discusses the horror that Ma underwent while she was captive in the Room, but also conveys some of the biases and misconceptions of the modern world.  These are mostly explored because the author uses Jack as a narrator, and his sheltered innocence brings these items to life.  The narration is a little hard to get used to, but once you adjust it tells a very strong and compelling story.  This is one of the strongest books of the year for me so far.

B0007OCG56|5.0|This a nice family movie: no foul language, no obligatory sex scenes.  The female lead is beautiful; the story is credible.  I wish I could find more movies like it.  A similar movie that I liked is \\"For Roseanna\\".
B0021L8V0W|3.0|It was a typical Angelina Jolee type role.  The story line had quite a few twists to help keep my attention, you really do not know who the good and bad guys truly are until the end, which I enjoy.  But over all the move was extremely bloody and violent.  Not really my type of movie, but I did want to see what all the rave's I had heard were about.  If I had known it was this violent, properly would not have ordered it.  But after seeing her in \\"The Tourist\\", I felt she is very talented, let's give this a try, her talent is obvious, but one would think by now she would choose more movies to show her talent instead of her athleticism.
B003EY7IUY|5.0|I have been reading the shopaholic series since the first book came out when i was in high school. I love sophie kinsella's wit and charming characters. My girlfriends and I always get excited when we see that a new shopaholic book hits the shelves. With Mini Shopaholic, I was not disapointed. I was so at home being back with becky bloomwood and luke brandon. Beckys antics remind me of old episodes of I Love Lucy. And her way of thinking is always hilarous! If you are looking for an easy read with lots of quick wit, and dramatic plot lines, pick up Confessions of a Shopaholic.. cause after the first book you fall i love with all the characters, and can understand the utter excitment of Mini Shopaholic which did not disappoint..
B004G600A4|5.0|Tangled, the movie, was purchased for our granddaughter's fifth birthday in early April.  After ordering, it came promptly and she was thrilled with the gift.  This movie has been played about 20 times since the birthday.
B004MKLRQA|5.0|A long way gone is a story that has changed my life.  After reading this stunning book I have began to view life a different way and be fortunate for my life and thankful I have not undergone the horrors some go through in their lives at such a young age.  This book leaves you thinking and it is almost impossible to put down! In the book you embark on an adventure with Ishmael, the main character, and go with him though one of the hardest parts of his life.  The detail in the book is done remarkably.  Every detail, from what he sees to the way people are killed or lying on the ground is deep.  I recommend this book to most people, although it can be a bit gruesome it is a book about life that makes you treasure yours and become aware of problems throughout the world.  After reading this book your life will not be the same.  Ishmael is an outstanding author whose work should be read and enjoyed by all, especially those in their teens to make them thankful for what they have.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|I bought the Turtle Beach PX21 Gaming Headset two months ago, and this was my first gaming headset. The nice things about this headset are the sound quality, dual volume control (one for game volume, one for chat), flexible boom mic, no need to charge, and you can use this headset for pc. The problem I had with them is that they are not made of high quality material. I took good care of this heaset but one day the small piece of plastic that allows the right ear piece to swivel broke detaching the right ear from the headset. I was able to rig it (tape the earpiece back on) in order for it to work, but I would think that for $80 they could afford to use some higher quailty material. Unless you put your headset in a trophy case after using it, I would recommend investing in a more durable headset.
B003A4IFDW|1.0|\\"All of My Love\\" is one of the worst covers I have ever heard. It is painful to hear.  She sounds like someone is torturing her. I have to turn off the radio every time I hear it come on.  Some people should learn to leave classic songs alone.
1400095204|4.0|An informative book about the war in Nigeria that led to the formation and eventual dissolution of Biafra.  The impact that this conflict had on the lives of the characters was engaging.  It is also a fascinating love story on several levels and will keep the reader absorbed until the last page.
B004I4H8PO|3.0|I received my package yesterday. Three of the cd's were not in the tray and one has a minor scratch. I'm not about to send it back for one that could be in worse condition. The dvd had a little glue on the edge. I was able to clean that off and it played just fine. Everything else was ok. It's a sad day when I spend my hard earned money for something that is packaged so poorly.
0756404738|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and how well it was written. This book does one thing that most other books don't do; I gives such a good description of the characters and setting that when you close your eyes you can imagine what you were just reading. I have only seen a few other books do that and all of them are favorites of mine. The book is like a portal in that when you begin to read it, your regular mind begins to fall asleep and your imagination wakes up.<br /><br />This book makes me wish that the sequel was out already so I could continue the story. One aspect that struck me was the wit and intelligence that most characters possessed. The wit really brought the main character to life and made me laugh at times. This book would be great for people that want to loose themselves in a different world and be a different person for the time that they read the book. Overall I really enjoyed this book and think that it deserves a five star.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B002ZG99QS|5.0|Awesome movie! Very exciting and great soundtrack. Plot is a little simple (as is expected of most Disney Movies), but awesome and entertaining none-the-less.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|This movie is hilarious and wicked fun! The songs and dances (especially) are amazing! You will be singing and dance to them long after the movie's over!
0316056863|5.0|I can only echo most of the positive reviews of this book, but do want to add that her take on women in comedy (and women in general in this era) is right on the money. \\"Do your own thing and don't care if they don't like it.\\" It's not mean, it just isn't an issue anymore.  I'm putting her up there with Richard Feynman for that one.     The book is also really funny.
1907563202|4.0|I bought this book for the cover!  You never know what you will get, but I was quite pleased with it's contents.  I have crocheted for many years, and have become quite picky about the pattern books I buy, because so many of them have only one or two good patterns in them.  That said, I would make almost everything in this book.  If you love to crochet, this book will not be a disappointment.

031261246X|5.0|The scariest part about this book is how absolutely possible this is. Very similar to Dr. Robin Cook type novels except instead of medical thriller - this is technical. Mark tells a tale that could all too easily happen in real life.  Very well written, it will keep you hooked. I hope he writes another because there is never a better book than one written by someone who KNOWS the industry. Too many authors have to go do a ton of research to be able to speak intelligently about a subject. Mark is a renowned expert - from being the inventor of the Sysinternals suite which everyone who works in IT uses... to becoming a Technical Fellow at Microsoft. So it just flows naturally for him.  I also work for Microsoft (though regrettably I don't know Mark personally... haven't ever even met him but he has been a hero of mine for many years). I work in one of the most highly technical departments at MS and I can tell you, the technical aspects of the book are spot on.  You'll enjoy it.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|It had potential but as I watched it more and more disenchantment set-in for the following reasons:<br />(1.) Jolie's acting consisted of showcasing her physical attractiveness and little else.<br />(2.) Depp's acting consisted of his always entertaining, but tiresome for this shallow story, quirky mannerisms.<br />(3.) Too heavy dependence on Venetian setting and extravagance, etc. to compensate for a disjointed storyline and minimalistic acting.<br />(4.) Storyline was a disjointed ripoff of segments of similar past movies e.g. accountant steals money from bad guy boss; Russian mafia; hot girlfriend implicitly involved; exotic locations including the usual gondolas; speeding boats and always just-missing gunshots; deceptive getaways that were not very believable; inept cops of various nationalities; extremely unlikely guessing games such as Depp's changed appearance from the original thief now turned into small town math teacher - really not even close to being a logically solvable solution to the story's guessing games.<br />(5.) Had potential but forgettable. They should have taken a year or two to write a more intelligent and creative story.<br /><br />P.S. Those associated with this movie might rescue their consciences by donating some of their ill-gotten profits to some worthwhile cause such as, just to pick one,  girl's education in Afghanistan.
B004G6009U|5.0|our first time pre-ordering. we live in a small town and usually things take longer to get here, and everything is expensive,but the Amazon price was great and the movie arrived the day after it was  released, with free shipping.  very happy with the purchase, the kids love this movie and had been waiting for it to come out on DVD for months. I will probably preorder with Amazon again.

0452289963|5.0|I really cant say enough about this book. It WILL change you. If you are ready to be transformed/enlightended/concious/present then this is certainly a good place to start. Take your time to read it. I'm generally a quick reader and I purposely took a month to read this book. A tough book to review in detail because you really have to read it to understand/appreciate. Best book I've ever read and has really given me an entirely new attitude in life. Enjoy.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele is one of those timeless artisists.She is a person that I see that will go a long way in the music biz<br />19,her first albumn isnt as deep as her newest albumn 21.But still,a soulful Adele makes you go into another world with a beautiful voice singing in your ear.<br />It has some neat upity songs,like,Right as Rain,but Chasing Pavements is THE song on the albumn.<br />I give it 5 stars on just her voice alone.<br />Lots of talent in this cd,and of course,her album 21,is also so fantastic!<br />Abby
0307477479|1.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did.  It had a great title, everyone raved about it.  But, the story fell flat.  The characters didn't really intrigue me, and it was like, it could have been good, but it just wasn't.  And what was up with that last chapter?  It came out of nowhere, meant nothing and didn't relate to anything else in the book.  Like so much of the current fiction, it seemed much more like a bunch of short stories, loosely strung together, and had no meaning or current to tie them together.  Where's my plot, where's my story arc?  I was not a fan, and doubt I will be reading anything else of hers anytime soon.
031261246X|4.0|Techno-thriller, painfully probable scenarios of \\"digital Pearl Harbor\\", finally a piece of fiction that a geek would find at least amusing. But \\"Zer0 Day\\" by Mark Russinovich is not only for the geeks. It is also simply a good, entertaining read. It is hard to put this book down. And that is, perhaps, the best compliment that a writer can get.     While the book has many literary attributes (fast action, compelling characters, intriguing conflict, etc.), it is also shocking with unfortunate realism of its \\"what if\\" scenario. Are we as defenseless, as we appear in Russinovich's \\"Zer0 Day\\"? Could four or so obsessed wanna-be terrorist with little cash (not much, tens of thousands of euros) pull it off and truly checkmate the digital world, as we know it?     The conclusion, while somewhat optimistic, is actually chilling. \\"All we can really do now is wait [...]. But know that if not this time, then next.\\"     Just like Tom Clancy's books were read by presidents (at least by Ronald Reagan), \\"Zer0 Day\\" by Mark Russinovich should find it's place on President Obama's reading list. The good thing is that at least we know for sure that his Cybersecurity Coordinator has read it. And endorsed it.
0761158820|5.0|I had no idea that a papertoy craze has been sweeping the nation. Now that I have been made aware of the existence of papertoys, I have to say that I'm ready to hop on the bandwagon. The monsters you can create are adorable and scary, cute and creepy.  I think the real appeal of Papertoy Monsters is that you don't need much to make really cool monsters. You must have opposable thumbs, glue, and a little bit of patience. That's it! Other people who are skilled at art and math have done the actual work and handily bound it up and made it available to the masses. Fifty weird and quirky little monsters are ready to be sprung forth from the pages with the twist of a paper and stroke of a glue stick.     Each project spreads across three pages. The first page provides a full color illustration of how your creature will look fully assembled, with a little tag giving type, variant names, origin, description and abilities. The opposite side of this page provides assembly instructions and a fun little descriptive paragraph on your monster.  We had a great time flipping around and reading all the imaginative backgrounds on these guys. Then, of course, the final page, made from slightly heavier paper is the hands-on part. Each piece is scored and perforated, so removing them is frustration free.        There are fifty projects available, split among three difficulty levels, easy, intermediate and advanced.  Each design is marked with a yellow tab in the upper left corner identifying the level, so you can choose your projects accordingly. To test the waters, we started with Heidi, an oversized bug monster who lives inside closets. I specifically chose this one because it seemed the easiest of the easy, containing two pieces and two directives. We punched out both pieces, body and door, then used a glue stick to attach the tabs in numerical order. In no time at all (thanks to the quick drying abilities of a glue stick), we were holding a cute/ugly three dimensional orange spottedmonster. Fun!  We felt confident about moving on to Zeke, an under bed dwelling monster, who literally has a bed balanced on his head. And we're eying Zwart, a shadow type monster who lurks behind a kid greedily clutching a lollipop.     Overall, this turned out to be full of super cool projects that we are still enjoying.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This identification of an excellent DVD is misleading.  To say \\"by Roger Allam\\" does not identify the author, director, composer, producer or inspiration of the production.  Nor does it inform the purchaser about the cast, except about one minor character who happens to be the first alphabetically.
076115728X|5.0|have read a lot of positive press on this book and was so excited to be able to check it out first hand.  How pleased I was to discover that everyone else before me was right on - what a brilliant children's book!  We all have our fair share of mistakes - an oops here and a whoopsie there. Barney Salzberg  shows us how to turn those little errors into something beautiful every time. A torn piece of paper becomes the jagged smile of a sweet crocodile. He turns drips of paint into driving pigs, a bent paper into a penguin's beak, and spilled coffee into a work of art.    Just so you know what you are getting, A Beautiful Oops! is not a large picture book. It is about the size of a board book, but more puffed up to accommodate all the fun extras inside, like a board book on steroids. Some pages have pop-ups, liftable flaps, or pages that open out. There are holes to peer through, bent edges and oddly shaped pages. I love that each page is different from the last, so you never know what's around the corner (literally). The illustrations are every bit as varied and surprising. Would you have guessed that spilled purple paint could turn into a pile of dogs or a nest of baby birds? Not only does clever Salzberg demonstrate his ability to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary, but encourages us to do the same!     Although the book is small in size, it definitely should not be limited to young children. In addition to being fun, A Beautiful Oops! contains a very valuable message for people of all ages. Just because you made a mistake, doesn't mean you should give up. Rather, treat your errors as an opportunity to make something even more creative. Although this is a lesson best learned while young, to save a lot of stress and heartache, it's never too late to learn that rolling with the punches is a heck of a lot more fun that striving for perfection.
0156027321|4.0|I started to read this book because it was picked for a book club a friend of mine had just started up.  To be honest I only kept reading the book because I wanted to be able to contribute to the book club discussion.<br /><br />Typically when I read I become the main character or a close friend of the character. The story comes to life in my head and I feel a deep connection with the main character.  This has lead to many, many interesting dreams following an evening of reading.  This is also why I cannot watch any movie when I have already read the book, I get upset when the characters to not match what I have created in my head.<br /><br />This book was different.  While I did become attached to Pi through the first part of the book, as soon as he was in the lifeboat I had to walk away.  I kept reading but I made it a point not to be connected.  I did not want to feel his suffering.  I did not want to be the one who had to kill a turtle or a fish or clean up after a Tiger.<br /><br />Since I no longer had that connection the author's great detail sometimes annoyed me.  When I was connected to Pi, all the detail was tolerable and I often assumed it would be useful information later in the book.  When I disconnected, it was annoying and trite.<br /><br />As soon as Pi was off the boat I reconnected.  I read the last section intently and I felt like my friend was back. And the ending was very thought provoking.<br /><br />I feel the book was well written but was not a book for me, someone with a great love for animals and a weak heart when it comes to their suffering.  If you can handle that, then I think you will really enjoy this epic tale of triumph over tragedy and the will to survive in even the direst of circumstances.
B001FJ9HHW|5.0|Just got this today and the sound is incredible. Seems like all Porcupine Tree releases are in DVD-A are $100+ dollars. I splurged and bought his double disc and it's solid as it gets.     It's a nice mix between Radiohead and Yes.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|If everyone became aware of this video the top people at GS would go to jail for the worst crime ever committed.
B002NYB712|3.0|I know I will get a lot of not helpful votes from longtime Tree fans (I am one, too), but The Incident is a disappointment. Porcupine Tree must be commended for their ambition, but this is a failed experiment. There are enough good tracks here to satisfy a long-time Porcupine Tree fan (Time Flies, Black Dahlia) and the newer fans (Bonnie the Cat, Octane Twisted) but most of the tracks are filler or just aren't very good. The title track, however, is a wonderful industrial-inspired delight that is definitely the highlight of the album along with Time Flies. Those two tracks alone make this worth three stars. I eagerly await Steven Wilson's new solo album, since Insurgentes is one of his greatest works.
0307454541|5.0|Given the heaps of reviews here I'll keep it simple.<br /><br />In short, I loved the book.  Good story. Good characters.  Good pace (most of the time.)<br /><br />As most people have said, there are a lot of details and some misspellings, but if you can hang in there for a minute, things start to get interesting - I promise!
1594484805|4.0|Obviously this book has made an impact on the business community with all of these great book reviews. As a sales manager, I found many pearls of wisdom in this relatively short book. More than a few ideas can be implemented immediately which I always appreciate. The one main idea I got from this book that I will use is giving our employees the space and latitude to be more creative about their jobs. Pink used some great examples of how to incorporate this into the workplace. In summary, a very good book that all managers and leaders should read.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|While this is the only book so far that should not be read before out of order, it is just as spellbinding as the others. Many authors can call their characters \\"witty\\" and/or \\"charming\\" but few can really pull off making you FEEL it. Julia Quinn I feel, has a special talent for this. Every book in this series has had me laughing out loud, and Colin truly is the most charming character I have ever read about (and as a self-proclaimed book worm I've read ALOT of romance novels.) And even given this fact, it was still nice to be able to go beyond his charming exterior in this novel. I would HIGHLY recommend this series, but I would also recommend starting with the first book in the series [[ASIN:B000FC1PMU The Duke And I]].
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game seems more &quot;proof of concept&quot; than a real attempt at a complex title. Nonetheless, the puzzles largely made sense - but I do wish there was more of an indicator of what could be clicked/touched than having me tap blindly until something reacted.<br /><br />The ending is abrupt, but seems to set up the possibility for more titles. Developers, I say go for it! The engine you've built is worthy. Now show us what you can really do!
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Works quite well on droid x. Also install on desktop to sync bookmarks if desired, them delete of you want. Search for &quot;Opera mobile user agent&quot; on google to have a desltop like version 100% of the time. Nice layout also.

B004L49K2A|4.0|After being unimpressed with Duran Duran's previous album (no thanks to Timbaland), I wasn't sure if I wanted to hear the new Duran Duran album All You Need is Now but then I heard the title track on youtube and decided to give it a shot. I am glad I got All You Need is Now. The album is a joyous explosion of pop songs that is a lot of fun to listen to. Yes, the material isn't classic like the band's music from the '80s but I do think it is pretty darn good. Mark Ronson does a much better job as producer than Timbaland IMO. my only quibbles with the album is the often corny lyrics (i.e The Man Who Stole a Leopard) and repetition (i.e Mediterranean). Didn't care for some of the melodies on the aforementioned songs too. All You Need is Now is a fun album, a classic it is not but fun nonetheless.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|A Storm of Swords quickly became my favorite in the Song of Ice and Fire series to date, leaving me breathless and with teeth often clenched tighter than King Stannis. There were so many shock and awe moments throughout this book it kept me up well past 2:30 in the morning most nights because I couldn't put it down for fear of leaving someone in a lurch.    \\"If I go to bed, Tyrion might not be alive when I wake up in the morning,\\" I squeaked. \\"If I turn off the light, Jon Snow might have his head lobbed off by Mance Rayder while I'm sleeping.\\"    While I won't give anything away for those who've yet to read this far into the series, I will say this: Martin is definitely not afraid to kill his characters, so brace yourself. Other reviews I've read claimed Martin's willingness to make his creations suffer is a bad thing, and some have even said they stopped reading when the blood started to wash the walls of every castle in Westeros, but in a game as deadly as this, how can we expect everyone to survive?    Since book one Tyrion Lannister intrigued me, and my love for him as a character has only continued to grow. One of the most delightful surprises in A Storm of Swords, however, was how quickly Martin warmed me to characters I'd previously loathed with a passion. I found myself actually feeling a hint of fondness for both Jaime and The Hound, and even a little sympathetic toward Stannis Baratheon.    I only have a few minor complaints about A Storm of Swords. For one, I would have liked to follow Bran's path a little more closely toward the end, and the lack of attention paid to his journey made him feel as if he disappeared entirely. Perhaps, considering Bran's actual situation, that was Martin's intention. I'm not sure.     I was also thrown off by the number of typos I came across in the Kindle version. I'm not sure if these were Kindle exclusive typos, but one example that really stands out around 41%: \\"Yet Ser Axell proposes we swoop down on the homes they leftbehind, to rape their windows and put their children to the sword.\\" Oops! Watch out, windows of the fallen men. Stannis' men are coming for you.\\"    Despite the number of typos, and occasionally feeling like Bran was all but invisible, I still give the book five out of five stars.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|The film editor should have done a better job of editing. I came away from watching this film with a sense of \\"disjointedness\\". The performances of the actors was good, but the film did not deliver in its presentation of the \\"HEREAFTER\\" topic. Too many deadends killed this film.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Fun game wish it was longer!! Fantastic job!!! I love the puzzles and graphics were excellent!! Hope to see more future products!!
0440241901|4.0|its a bit cliche' but Emma really pulled it off..she's really funny very easy read..i read 7 chapters of this book at Barnes & Noble.    Sophie Kinsella really is a genius she's very elaborate you can really see her stories through the book
B000QCS8TW|4.0|To be honest I was actually forced to read this book... My son, back from Iraq, was going crazy over these books saying that he loved this entire series and it kept him busy with something to read and kept his sanity as well... I was recommending a few books for him to read, not that he will, but stated that i would read his book, if he reads one of mine, fair is fair I thought... Because this is NOT the type of book I would read. It's total fantasy, which I've never read that genre.<br /><br />Really, the a total fantasy world made up in someone's mind... I mean I do enjoy a fantasy book, but this was REALLY fantasy... in my opinion WAY OUT THERE... but I finally got through the book, and midway, I found that it wasn't such a chore to read, after being very reluctant to read it... but I made a deal with my son.<br /><br />As I was saying, half way through the book I finally gave in and actually started enjoying the book and when the book ended it left me very curious... so curious in fact, that i went ahead and orderd the next 3 books, and knowing that #5 will be out at some point.<br /><br />Now, if I could only get him to read the book(s) I wanted him to read... lol... that's next :)
B004I4H8PO|4.0|I will not review the music but will focus on the packaging.  Mine came today as I took the risk even after reading the reviews.  I only had one disc (5.1 sound) that was out of its place.  The first disc did have a spot of glue on the bottom but I got most of it off and seems to be playing fine.  One of the tickets had a small bend in the corner, no big deal.  I think it was mostly due to the fact that it's loose in the package, a dumb idea by who put this together.  Mine also had a sticker on the plastic wrap that said Made in Germany. So, overall my box was ok compared to a lot of other reviews I've read.  I think this box could have been much better though, especially for the price.  Some of things like the tickets feel thin and cheap, the sticker for the pick guard is kind of dumb, they should have put in a real pick guard.  The Derek is Eric button was fine.  The cd's definitely should have been packaged separately in the box.  The vinyl to me doesn't matter and probably wasn't necessary, could have been released separately, which would have made the box a lot more compact as opposed to everything being loose.  In the end I agree with the others, caveat emptor.
0545123275|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I started reading it last night and stayed up until 3am, not wanting to put it down, not sleepy because I was so intrigued, wanting to know what was going to happen next... I ultimately MADE myself go to bed. Today, I was zipping around, doing chores so I could get back to the book and be able to finish reading it without having to stop for another chore, I wanted my mind fully emersed in the story again.<br /><br />I didn't want it to end !!! The ending nearly made me cry with shock and joy and the urgent feeling of \\"what happened? what happens next? it can't be over!\\" All these feelings, with the abrupt ending, made me love the book even more, and finding out that the next book following is due out this Summer... wonderful... just wonderful !
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Love the game!  very well done.  But, it is unplayable on my Nexus One.  The touch screen is a piece of junk. Not the app's fault.  The game plays really well on my Xoom.
0316067938|5.0|This is the first vampire series I've ever read! Seriously! I loved it. I loved the romance and all of it.<br />It's a great series and I couldn't put them down.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|First off, this is a very good MiniSeries, and if you can get a decent deal, it is worth owning.  Unfortunately, it cannot hold its own in comparison to its precursor, \\"Band Of Brothers.\\"  It does excel in one category - the combat action scenes.  They are as good as, and in many cases better than, the best from \\"BOB\\" or \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"  They are worth it on their own. Those get 5 stars.  It also drives home just how miserable, in contrast to the ETO, the conditions were for the grunts in the PTO.  But the rest of the series gets 3 stars, if that.  First - the casting is average in the best of cases, and poor in many cases.  The most glaring example is the actor they chose to play one of the 3 main male leads - Joseph Mazzello, the kid from \\"Jurassic Park\\".  He still looks exactly the same, and he just can't carry this series.  Fortunately, he doesn't have much of a role for the first half of the series, but after that, he's the star.  Second - the script (the spoken dialogue) is weak.  Perhaps part of the reason is that \\"BOB\\" only needed to fill in dialogue details to put the late Stephen Ambrose's excellent \\"Band Of Brothers\\" book on film.  \\"The Pacific\\" was based on 3 books, written by 2 of the characters in the series.  So the writers had to put an entire story together.  But that's no excuse for the dialogue.  There are no strong camaraderies that you can really believe in, in this series.  And after you've watched the whole thing, I'll bet you can only recall the names of 4 main characters.  I had very high expectations.  It did not meet them all, but it is still a very good series.
0385335997|5.0|I absolutely loved this book !!! I love the fantasy, romance, sex, excitement, fighting, old ways, history, humor, etc... I love learning new things, all of the healing herbs were quite interesting as well.<br /><br />I found myself reading wide eyed, with my mouth open, and at times, I was grasping the book with both hands so ingulfed and then I would start laughing and just had to re-read the funny part that made me laugh, or the OMG what just happened? and had to re-read that as well... It drew me in from the beginning and I went to bed dreaming of this book, and what had occured and what could possibly happen next, and found myself wanting to read it, when I was working and didn't have the time to pick the book up, so needless to say I couldn't wait to get back to reading it.<br /><br />It was just plain wonderful and now I am a BIG fan of these books and the entire series
B004XWLN20|5.0|Given that HD versions of Seasons 1-4 episodes already exist for purchase or rental on Amazon Video on Demand (as well as Netflix, etc.), Warner's claim that the special effects during these seasons were produced in standard definition only and not up to Blu-ray full capabilities, doesn't really hold water.  The HD versions have already been produced and exist to master the Blu-rays from limiting Warner's additional production costs.  My system includes the latest Panasonic 65\\" 3D plasma display (Pioneer SC-37 7.1 AV Receiver; JBL L-880's) and video collection features Blu-ray & HD-DVD copies of seasons 5-9 (10's on order).  I have also viewed seasons 1 through 4 on DVD (along with several HD episodes using VOD) and once beyond about the start of season two, the video reproduction is actually quite good.  Not Blu-ray resolution and color depth, but better than I have seen in many other DVD's of TV programs I own.  In regards to the visual special effects, even on the latest season Blu-rays, Smallville's TV sized production budget shows in most shots.  In fact, some of the effects shots being used in the later seasons date back to the very earliest episodes (i.e. night shot of the Daily Planet building with the helicopter flying down and then existing screen left) so I am not sure why Warner is concerned we would be disappointed in the Blu-ray results now.  The Blu-rays would also offer the benefits of lossless audio which with some of the very impressive sound tracks this series has produced would really be missed on the DVD's.  If Warner were to invest the extra money now to make this package available in Blu-ray in today's dollars, I suspect the potential exists for this series to be a very long term profit center with little future costs.  I understand that there will be a difference in the quality as the seasons progress if they were to produce seasons 1-4 in HD to go along with their existing HD masters available for seasons 5-10 but considering how poor otherseries (i.e. Six Million Dollar Man) vary in quality not only from season to season on DVD, but from episode to episode as well in the same year, I'm not sure Warner can use the excuse of low resolution visual effects as an excuse in this case.  Please include on the packaging (external & internal) noting the fact as many prior disc issues have already done and I suspect the vast majority of the buyers will understand the limitation you had to work from.  The reduced number of Blu-ray discs and their smaller number of masters needed (instead of 62 DVD's) for a complete collection should also help to offset the higher Blu-ray production costs.  Warner, there's still time and from the studio that has produced some really memorial Blu-rays (i.e. Blade Runner) for my collection, I hope that you will produce what your customers are wanting to buy.  The price is certainly high enough to justify the effort and in the end, isn't that how a business model succeeds.  QUICK FIRST VIEWING IMPRESSION UPDATE:  November 29, 2011  Perhaps this might help should you be considering acquiring the Blu-ray release of [[ASIN:B003L77GGA Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray]]] in addition to or in lieu of purchasing [[ASIN:B004XWLN20 Smallville: The Complete Series]].  Both of my orders arrived in the same box from Amazon an hour ago and I performed a quick A-B comparison of the opening scene from the last episode \\"Finale\\" in addition to the 3 special features included as part of the Season 10 release to determine the amount of difference both visually and sonically.  Having watched the original CW broadcasts in HD, the Blu-ray version is far superior viewing experience.  This is particularly evident in the medium and wider master shots, black level detail (crushes more on the DVD's) with a much more expansive sound stage (5.1 DTS HD Master Audio on the Blu-rays verses 5.1 Dobly Digital on the DVD's) offering much more enveloping atmospherics with cleaner, more distinct vocals.By comparison, in addition to the expected lower picture resolution, the sound field is much more biased to the front sound stage with voices recorded at a lower comparable volume level sounding slightly compressed on the DVD's verses the Blu-ray's.  [[ASIN:B004XWLN20 Smallville: The Complete Series]] ultimately is a very impressive series package featuring exceptionally well done content (will take some time to read all 16 pages of the Daily Planet) that I already feel was well worth the money even if I haven't yet had the time to view any of it yet.  I understand Warner's decision concerning the reasons why this was not released on Blu-ray.  As you view the special features (especially the one on the 200th episode \\"Homecoming\\"), the difference between the clips from most recent shows along with the interviews shot for the Season 10 Special Features (10801/24p except the music video & deleted scenes which are 480i/60) when it jumps to scenes from the earlier years is quiet distinct visually.  The latter lacks sharpest, color clarity/depth even on Blu-ray.    If one were to use Star Trek-The Next Generation as a gauge for a studio going back (18 years in 2012 since it ended in 1994!) and investing the money to re-comp all of the special effects to bring it up to the level of Blu-ray, will I still be around or care in 2029.  If you've been a dedicated fan of Smallville whether recently such as myself or from the very beginning in 2001, either the [[ASIN:B003L77GGA Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray]]] or the complete series should satisfy.  While the ultimate value choice is for each to make, I have no regrets completing my collection even if 5 of the SD seasons included in the complete series were double dipped as the extras on the [[ASIN:B004XWLN20 Smallville: The Complete Series]] appear to be exceptionally well worth the money spent.

B0032Y8XH8|4.0|It's not very often that we find a CD that my whole family LOVES(from my dad to my five year old daughter, and the teens in between).  There is not a single track we skip because we don't like it and listen to the CD constantly.  However, I agree with the earlier review, why the language (with no warning label)?  We have to skip Little Lion Man when the kids are listening; I know I'm showing my age, but I do wish there was an edited CD available - would have given 5+ stars.

The ability to copy tracking numbers in-app. This would make it, of course, be used to get this information into a package tracking app. (By the way, if you're looking for a fairly easy way to do this, just open the order confirmation email Amazon sends you in a recent version of the Gmail app. The email will contain the tracking number, and you can grab it using Gmail's &quot;Select Text&quot; menu option.)  2. More generally, it would be nice to be able to select text in product pages, reviews, etc. This could be used for many reasons, not the least of which would be researching a product before purchase and backing up claims reviewers make (praise/complaints) about a product through other sites.  3. A view in which full reviews could be browsed all on one page. The current swipe-to-the-side-after-each-review setup is a bit of a hassle.  4. The ability to say whether or not a review was helpful or not. This is one of the few things shy of launching into a tirade that reasonable users can do after reading the occasional review clearly written from a mental hospital (or, on the other side of the review spectrum, the individual whose reviews are Feynman-thorough).  These are all minor complaints/suggestions for an otherwise great product. Keep it up, Amazon!
B001UV4XHY|3.0|Great road trip movie.  A bit slow at times, but excellent character building, and even some decent acting by the main three.  They really have come a long ways.  Especially Harry / Daniel who over the past few films has grown immensely as an actor.    However, I am SO, SO sick of the studios PURPOSEFULLY doing a bad job on their DVD transfers only to promote Blu-Rays.  The explosion of combo packs has driven this further, because many folks with a 32\\" or smaller 720p set can't see the difference between a Blu-Ray and upcoverted DVD...UNLESS the DVD is a *terrible* quality source.  The studios are now MALICIOUSLY doing horrible transfer jobs in order to make the Blu-Ray look better.  This is not conspiracy theory.  Watch for yourself by comparing HP7 with HP4 or 5 on DVD!    There is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON that the HP7 DVD should look this bad.  First off, it is only using a fraction of the available DVD dual-layer space available, and as such is *riddled* with compression artifacts.  You need no more proof than that, but the real proof is in the pudding!  Compare the HP4 and HP5 dark scenes with those in HP7 pt 1 and you will see NIGHT AND DAY difference in quality.  Things should be better today, not worse.  You can't tell me it was on accident.  This was almost certainly found and raised during quality control, and quietly snuffed by the marketing folks.  It was engineered this way on purpose.    While we are a Blu-Ray household with 4 total BD players (living room, MBR, newest desktop, newest laptop), we have nearly a dozen DVD Players counting older laptops, desktops, portable DVD players, and cars.  Overall, this movie undoubtedly will be watched more on DVD than on BD.  We shouldn't be subjecdted to inferior quality just because some bozo in Marketing things it will impact BD sales 1% to 2%.  I don't care if he's right.  It's not fair.  We pay a good price for the DVD, and we should get a product that is the best possible for the money.  Not one that is artifcially neutered for marketing reasons!!!    I blame Warner Brothers.  There is no excuse for this.  I do not feel this was an accident, and this needs to stop!    Rhino
1439148953|4.0|I loved the way this book was written. I felt like I was actually there in some parts of the story, especially the swimsuit part! It was funny and it was moving and very rich in many ways. The dialogue was superb! But when I had finished the story I felt like the author had been in a terrible hurry and it ended way too abruptly, I was left with an empty feeling after I had finished and I do not like that! Maybe that is what he had wanted to achieve? I would highly recommend this book. It was entertaining and well written but the plot was weak and the ending not what I had expected.
0439023513|2.0|I liked the first two books.    I hesitate to post my reasons for being massively frustrated with book three, primarily because I don't want to create spoilers and I respect others' right to form their own opinions.    ** SPOILERS ** Please don't read further if you don't want them    The character development doesn't progress further than earlier installments.  Katniss remains a somewhat passive pawn of forces beyond her control who are doing the real world-changing; her primary feature is poor impulse control and she keeps defying orders: it is mostly through luck that she is even involved in any significant scenes.  The real action is always accomplished by off-page forces.    However, my real disappointment in both the author and the protagonist lies both in the fact that Katniss becomes a rather casual murderer (both of an important leader and of an enemy civilian who was about to call out a warning) - attributable in part, no doubt, to the circumstances she was subjected to in earlier books.  However, I found it absolutely stunning that at the end, she votes yes to approving a new Hunger Games (to the death) imposed upon the children of the overthrown, formerly dominant regime as part of \\"justice.\\"  It's a stunning moral lapse and it retroactively taints the whole trilogy for me, wasting an opportunity for Katniss to recognize how evil is located in systems and in apathy, not in the \\"Other\\" (other people groups, nationalistic enemies, etc.)  It severed my ability to relate to her in any way as a likable humane character.  What a jaw-dropping record-scratch moment.    The third book is also darker than the first two and is filled with very bloody and dark scenes as disturbing as anything in, say, Apocalypse Now.  I'm not thrilled that the books are marketed toward young adults: to the extent that they can provoke speculation about the dangers and ugliness of fascism and unchecked power, through a fictional and sadly not-that-exaggerated portrayal, perhaps theyserve a benefit.  But they also expose the reader to a great deal of unchecked darkness: accounts of kids (teenage) being maimed or tortured to death, hopelessness, sadism, suicidal thoughts,  a large group of little kids being bombed to bits as a psychological battle tactic, etc.  Being \\"dark\\" is certainly not an inherent fault, but I'm discouraged to think that this is what will be inherited by the Harry Potter- and Twilight-reading crowd.    To her credit, the author avoids a complete black and white \\"good guys\\" vs. \\"bad guys\\" dichotomy.  But rather than portraying a \\"we all have the potential for great good and great evil,\\" the final impression I was left with was a cynical \\"there are no good guys\\" vibe.  I'm not criticizing the whole trilogy wholesale, and I think that the first two books were an intriguing accomplishment.  I'm left feeling ambiguous about the way it wrapped up.  An ending doesn't have to be happy to be satisfying, but I felt that this was neither.  D+
B004K4IZ54|4.0|This movie is a graphic intensive movie but looking at the story line and actors and feeling-good-after-watching, it was not so satisfying. I mean no offense, nerds, who loved computers and last Tron so much, directed this movie. It was a good movie but it was not the best from Disney. Disney usually makes better movies, more frufilling movies than this.    But 3D was good. Quality was great. Movie rewards are sweet. You need to have 3D monitors, player, and glasses to watch this. When you don't have any of this items, the computer does not play it. I know it because I only dont have 3D monitor and 3D bluray does not get played.    This is a one-time- thrilling movie. but nothing more than that. It is boring to think about it or to watch it again.
1601251505|5.0|I don't have time for a long review, but I highly enjoy the Pathfinder system. The first Adventure our group played, I borrowed a book from a friend. It's high time I bought my own copy! We had a lot of fun and I created a character that, while probably not completely original, had enough flexibility that he felt like my own unique creation.<br /><br />If you've never tried Roleplaying Games in general but have some friends who know roleplaying games and can walk you through things, you'll love this product. Otherwise I would consider holding off until Paizo (the Pathfinder publishers) release their \\"Basic Game\\" box set in August 2011, which looks amazing. It is geared toward teaching new players and will include a rulebook, some maps, and pre-set adventures.
0439023513|5.0|This book has been written to perfection. There is no doubt in my mind this is the best book of the Hunger Games trilogy. Every scene is detailed to make you believe you are with Katnis Everdeen fighting peacekeepers from the capitol in District 2 or shooting down aircraft with an explosive bow and arrow in District 8. The book was only disapointing in one aspect,which was Peeta and Katniss's relationship. I feel like they could have made them closer instead of being so far almost to the point of no return. The relationship between Gale and Katniss becomes shaky at times and unbreakable at others. If you are a person who likes books to escape to another world then this is the book for you. It also has a magnificent reflection of reality aspect to it. You can tell from this and all of her other books that she believes that war and socialism will eventually lead to the extinction of the human race. Mockingjay speaks volumes about what is happening in communist countries all over the world. All in all i would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone it was a great and enjoyable read.   - VJP
1905113153|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase this book because, well let's face it, it is not cheap. Most of the cake books I have purchased I have borrowed from the library first or from other cake people, but this one is difficult to find to purchase, let alone borrow. I had been disappointed by books before. However, have no fear! This book is well worth the money. I love all the ideas I have found in this book. This book is not for beginners, but it does go over a lot of the basics of royal icing, which is a big plus. If you have not spent a lot of time working with royal icing, even the basics in this book will provide you with excellent information.     The tutorials are excellent and the accompanying photos provide an excellent reference to the step-by-step instructions.     This book is a must have for any serious cake artist.
B000HF6XKO|4.0|Overall the movie took time to understand, in trying to figure out how each sub storyline came together you'll discover how things we don't think about much affect others in a much greater sense. but if you pay attention closely this movie makes a strong point in our political system and our need for foreign resources.
B004NSULHM|1.0|I used to really love Radiohead.  After \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" everything changed.  I almost wish they had all died in a car crash--is that too unkind?    I listened to the entire album three times.  In the middle of \\"Goodbye Mr. Magpie,\\" I almost threw my iPod against the wall.    Please go the way of the White Stripes and quit.    I miss the days when people used to play these things called \\"instruments.\\"  Now we get people mumbling inside of an echo chamber in an attempt to put you to sleep.    I want to like it.  Really, I do.  But it sucks.
B004J713JW|1.0|if you have a high end home theater you will be frustrated by this disc.the audio is a mess.i tried many adjustments before i gave up.on top of the bad audio billy joel just can't perform live.for the amount of money he's making he should get his act together.he is amazing on piano but his singing is a disgrace.if i had paid for an overpriced ticket to this disaster i would have been furious.
0061733199|5.0|Pretty damn awesome. The cover really means what it says, if you want to learn more about outdoors then this is a definate book to read.
142311339X|5.0|this book is better than the entire percy jackson series. It is totally epic and amazing. Whether or not you read the percy jackson series, you should read this because it is one of the best books ever.  Not stop action and hints of mystery. Read it now!
0307279189|5.0|Bought this book for my wife, with no expectations, and she loves it. I constantly ask her how dry the material is since '...by it's cover' it's just a running book, but she comes back with tons of side stories and anecdotes from the book which seem really entertaining and interesting. She's not big into pompous literature or 'sea stories', but she does seem to take this book to more than a few places and to me, that speaks volumes. If nothing else, consider the price, great deal.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|I am living this nightmare today.....ironically in the birthplace of the oil industry. Titusvillians unite! Fight against water and air contamination!
B004PGO25O|3.0|The kind of work that Steven Pressfield urges you to do is only one out of several different kinds that most creative pursuits and projects usually require. Within the domain of that particular kind of work, his advice is sound.    Rational thinking, the so-called \\"Resistance\\" and other alleged enemies of the creative worker -- all these sneaky meanies also have useful functions to perform (such as, for example, preventing you from making costly mistakes).    That said, though, -- if you're the kind of person who is prone to writer's block and paralysis caused by over-thinking, then this book will probably deliver the friendly kick in the butt that you might need in order to get unstuck.
0915811774|5.0|I bought a copy of this book many years ago with the expectation of it being \\"something other\\" than what it was. I was disappointed and put it down. Many years later I came back to it - I was ready for it now. I'd gotten \\"beat down enough\\" in the romance dept and am now ready to experience what love truly is. This book is essentially beautiful, and has opened my heart in a way I wouldn't have known possible. I highly recommend it for you if you are interested in real love, not just shallow romantic notions. (no Cosmopolitan-like advise here!!)
B004LSJCJM|4.0|Joe B. is a rising star for sure. His artistry is masterful, voice and guitar riffs dynamic. However the last two studio cd's (the other being Black Rock)lack specific tonal quality that cheat the music from being top quality. I'm not sure why he hasn't noticed the same and demanded better sound engineering.....He's on a roll, but he should get this issue (IMO) taken care of.  It's really a shame because he's got everything else going for him. I guess the age of digital mp3 doesn't demand much in the way of tonal quality???But my ears tell me something when I play cds through my PA mixer. I expect each note to be crystal and uncluttered, so when I play JB's older cds and notice a big difference in sound quality, it makes me wonder where the industry is heading. Also Joe plays a mean acoustic by evidence of the #2cd on his Live From Nowhere in Particular album. Exceptional tonal quality on this 2 cd set and his best live cd. (IMO) Another favorite is the ballad Of John Henry...Dust Bowl is # 3 only because it's lacking the deep clear tonal perfections that would put JB on my buy now, hear later list. Note; I did not purchase Black Rock because of the sound quality, but purchased Dust Bowl because of the content of the material itself. Some decent sound engineering and this could be platinum plus in my book.
0439023513|3.0|This book is good, but it is easily the worst in the series. Most of the story is boring, and even the climax lacks. But if you've read the first two books, it is necessary for you to watch this.
B001D2AYCI|3.0|This is a nice release however the audio is flipping lousy at best you can hear the crackle of the vinyl and the 5.1 audio is so compressed it is atrocious. I ended up playing it back in 2ch stereo it was tat bad!! Is this even remastered? No more DVD releases for me I was expecting better tan this crap! From here out if it isn't on blu ray or sacd i will simply forget the band ever existed! Unbelievable that I can actualy hear the static of what sounds like an old record just unaceptable! And a joke at 30 clams worth 7.50 at best!
159420229X|4.0|This is a well written book with just the right mix of science and personal narrative to keep you interested. There are a lot of good tips for memorization and you find Josh to be an unlikely hero. I loved the part where he is really questioning his training and tries to see his behavior from the point of view of others - it was both poignant and humorous. I was especially interested in his take on the value of memorization from an educational standpoint and its role in developing not just intelligence (or at least the perception of intelligence), but its role in creativity. As a believer in the art in the memorization, I enjoyed the argument of this book.     Regardless of whether you believe in the need to teach memorization, if you are interested in the science of memory and like books that have a happy ending and showcase the rewards of working hard and giving something your all, you will find this book a good read.
B004G6009U|5.0|My 3-year-old daughter loves this movie.  She had to watch this everyday for 2 weeks after we got it.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Joe has returned to the blues that he seemed to lose while in Europe. The blues is what started my listening and is what I want, so glad this hits the spot.
B004MKLRQA|5.0|I'm a big fan of memoirs, but I find that many \\"new\\" memoirs are an expanded diary of someone's life, which may or may not be interesting to the reader. I believe the best memoirs are those that teach a life-lesson. This is EXACTLY what Beah accomplished through his memoir. He has given a gripping account of \\"reality\\" - making one think of the true impact of civil conflict and war. A Long Way Gone is an excellent example of \\"courage to survive\\" and \\"perseverance\\".
B004CJB0CM|5.0|This is one of my staples in my workout dvd's. I always use this video and mix it up or do 2 of the levels back to back. Its great for anyone looking for some motivation getting back into the gym or someone who is tired of the same old same old and wants some variety. I use Jillians workouts and I love the variety and ability to increase the complexity of the workout that is available in all of her dvds. But if you are only able to get one, this is where you should start. Challenge yourself and when you are ready, add on.
B000J103PC|4.0|Great movie! Love Meryl Streep in her role! She does a perfect job playing a villain with such poise and sophistication! Anne Hathaway is also great!
B000WMFZMY|5.0|It's been years since I had seen this and I enjoyed it.  Heston and Loren mix well together. Good mix of hollywood  and history.  No psychological twist here just good epic story with a big screen feeling and great location photography.  Enjoyable.  Video and audio quality were good in my opinon.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|This is a nice DVD version of Tora Tora Tora with interesting extras on the second disc.  I've had good luck buying these used DVDs from GoHastings.  I know you can sort out various problems with Amazon but I prefer that the item show up quickly and be what I was expecting.  Item itself is 5-star because I like the movie and this is a good transfer.  I also rate the vender highly.
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|This movie was good with the exception that majority of the movie, Princess Tiana spent it as a frog. She never got her chance to shine as a true princess. Disney dropped the ball in that aspect. It is so sad that their one and only African American princess did not span across the movie platform as a human princess in all of her beautiful dark skinned glory.
B000TNF7OC|4.0|The first years of UFO saw the band finding its way musically and while Mick Bolton's 3 albums with them are somewhat notable, it was obvious that the band were still trying to find their feet and voice in the rock world. By the time Michael Schenker enterned the frame on this release, their fourth, they'd finally arrived. The expanded, remastered edition of this album is very insightful and I highly recommend picking these remasters up for the faithful and for the newly initiated. The nuggets that can be found here are indsiputably, Rock Bottom and Doctor, Doctor. These tracks would give a great deal of testimony why Schenker brought so much to UFO's brand of rock music and provided it with a style from which the band could build upon. Other lesser known tracks like Crystal Light and Space Child seem to retain a bit of the former UFO qualities of the past, but with Schenker's distinctive playing, help to propel these numbers into an otherworldly style of sound. Oh My and Too Young To Know are below the gut rockers, while Time on My Hands is a swift, acoustic driven ballad-type of number that the band would continue to revisit on each successive album release. Built for Comfort kinda recalls a bit of Free in its interpretation, but never quite executes as successfully as they would have. The closing numbers, Lipstick Traces(a Schenker instrumental) and Queen of the Deep round out the record on a soild note and for an overall statement, Phenomenon certainly is a new and fresh start for the band that would continue to build from strength to strength over the next 3-4 years. There are some great bonus cuts for the die-hard fan here on the remastered release and also include, for a brief period, Bernie Marsden whom was the \\"inbetween\\" replacement and transition from Bolton to Schenker. I highly recommend this album to any fan of early 70's Hard Rock and for newbie's to UFO a GREAT, GREAT start!!!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Not bad but not great either. If you're in a pinch it will get the job done, but I recommend a 3-sided Arkansas stone such as this one: [[ASIN:B00062BIT4 Smith's TRI-6 Arkansas TRI-HONE Sharpening Stones System.]]
B001E3AXGS|5.0|For anyone who really wants to know all about Abraham Lincoln this is an invaluable book. It starts by exploring the early life of Abraham Lincoln and his rivals for the presidential nomination, showing how each of them matured and responded to their early lifes.<br /><br />Again and again it's clear that we have all been blessed by this man who was driven by his desire to leave an impression on the word. This book shows both the trials and the triumphs that Lincoln passed through on his way to the presidency. His greatness was partly because he could explain complex concepts in language that was accessible to his entire audience, at that stage mostly rural Americans.<br /><br />At the same time, the anecdotes of Lincoln receiving news in his night gown, or being woken to hear both good and bad news really show us the human side of Lincoln.<br /><br />It's a substantial book (700+) pages, but it ended far too quickly for me.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This app is as good as it can be. Of course it does not have Clear Channels stations due to their iheart radio app. I would easily rate this app as 5 stars if they would allow it to be installed on the SD card.
B003O5MO2A|4.0|I'd like to say that I'm a huge Cult fan because of the first four albums that set the stage and foundation for everything after, and although the band wasn't quite like this afterwards, it is nonetheless, my reasoning for being a faithful fan over the years. For its day, On Your Feet is a quality live record that remains a milestone of sorts for the early phase in the band's career. There are 3 cuts each from the albums with a pair of covers and the cool instrumental Buck's Boogie(which dates either between the first and/or second album sessions). BOC proves that they were just as viable of a live entity as they were in the studio, and nothing illustrates this more than the live renditions of Cult Classics like Hot Rails to Hell, Last Days of May and 7 Screaming DizBusters. Just listening to the guitars and rhythm section fitting in the pocket with these numbers and the tightness of how well they were growing as an ensemble is such a testament to the power of this group. There are moments when I feel that the performances could have been captured a bit better, but like I said earlier, for its time, its a pretty good live collection. The later live releases would be decent and sonically better mixed(The expanded edition of Some Enchanted Evening is well worth having, if not for the DVD that's included) and do capture different phases of the band, but personally don't match this first live effort and era of the band. It cannot be stressed enough how important the first four years of the group are the foundation from which everything else would either flourish or fragment for the band. Its all here within the 12 cuts as the proof. Indulge yourself!!!

B004SS0884|4.0|This is Britney's best cd in a long time, after Blackout and Circus, it was hard to tell what would happen. This isn't a personal album, it simply techno-pop brilliance, other then the one dud (track 8), this is just about pop perfections. Defnitely buy this cd, it's Brit's best work in ages!      Till the world ends, is like Brit meets the matrix, major cool. hold it agaisnt me is good too, but i love inside out, awesome track. Criminal, Gasoline, Trip to your heart are superb, And i lvoe Seal it with a kiss and how i roll, awesome!!!
B0036S4C6G|5.0|I was a little hesitant reading this because I wasn't crazy about \\"Invisible Circus\\" but since it won the Pulitzer, I thought I would give it a shot- it is amazing! And highly addictive. The innovative way that Egan helps you experience a story is trully brilliant and I am telling everyone I know to read this book.
B00005G41E|5.0|Very good Japanese edition of the album \\"Pies Descalzos\\": 10 tracks beyond the standard edition comes with exclusive bonus tracks for Japan Only: Estoy Aqui (The Love & House Mix) and Estoy Aqui (The Remix). Item very scarce and highly recommended.
B004OEMRGI|2.0|While his guitar playing is wonderful, his singing is less so to an ear used to European languages. The piece I heard on the radio did not mention the singing. Listen carefully to the music before you buy.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Based on a true story(Michael Oher still plays for the Ravens)this movie works on a lot of levels, sports, drama, etc, plus Sandra Bullock as a blonde is worth it she looks absolutely fabulous as a blonde! The whole family can enjoy this movie and the little fella who plays the youngest son is just great.
0307388921|5.0|This book is pure fun to read, it's so hard to pick a favorite chuck book. Choke is hilarious and even touching at times, Chuck Palahniuk is a genius and better be around for a long long time because I can read his books over and over again they're always great.
B000065VLN|4.0|Very good Japanese edition of the album \\"Laundry Service\\" in addition to 13 tracks of the standard edition comes with exclusive bonus track for Japan Only: Ojos As&iacute;. Recommended to all who appreciate the work of Shakira.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|At 45 years of age, Nightwish's Once has awakened an interest in music again that I haven't enjoyed since my teen  years and early 20's.  They have introduced me to great music like Epica, After Forever, Moonspell, Sirenia, Within Temptation, Delain, Tristania and others to numerous to mention.  I listened to Once consistently for two years and still put it on regularly.  The Ultimate album of the new millenium.
B003C1AL8K|5.0|This is a review for the 2010 reissue of Dangerous on vinyl record by label MusicOnVinyl. I have had Dangerous special edition CD for a few years now and it is my favorite Michael Jackson album, the infectious electronic beats with strange sounds that only Michael could create paired with the best voice and lyrics creates one of the most unique records ever. There are even some slow songs in here that somehow work great since they are a good order away from the fastest tracks. I had listened to Dangerous Special Edition CD at least 30 times and thought I knew every beat of every song. This record version of dangerous sounds so amazing that the whole time Michaels voice sounded way better and you could clearly hear the hundreds of sounds layering over eachother (like michael rapping in the background while he is singing, beatboxing, and humming the beat). It seems that song openings and closing are at least 10 seconds longer than the CD version, most likely they had to cut it when it went to CD to make sure it fit. The whole album sounded like a brand new thing to me and it was like I had never heard it the way it was meant to be heard. The difference between this record and the CD are astounding. If I could compare I would say a CD is VHS and Records are BluRay. This is a most own and definitely worth he 30$. It convinced me to checkout Invincible reissue, especially since the CD of Invincible always sounded loud and distorted to me. What a great reissue!
B004G6009K|5.0|BEST Disney Princess movie EVER!!!! Loved it!  I am 33 and have a little girl who has always been scared of the Disney princess movies because of their very evil villans.  But this was the best because even though Mother Gothel is indeed evil - she is not terrifying to look at.. she is just more sneaky than outwardy wicked.  The HORSE steals the show and I love what an important role the main guy plays in this movie!!
B004EPZ070|1.0|Caught a sneak peak, I should have snuck out.  Oh, how awful.  Kate Hudson is worse than awful.  Why does this woman keep getting hired.  I mean, if she volunteered to star in movies they should turn her down.  Poor thing has convinced herself that she's something special yet her wretched personality comes shining through in her acting and ultimately sinks the flick.  If she were a middle class broad, she'd be deemed a needy horrific mess of a person that most people would politely try to avoid. Hollywood, however, keeps feeding the machine and she feels like she has something to offer the world.  NOT NOT NOT.  Please retire and make room for better actors.  Go schlep the make up you make mega a bucks to support that doesn't even make you look all that.  Awful flick.
B003UESJ9M|3.0|There is a sticker on the Country Strong dvd package that says alternate ending and on the dvd itself in special features it says orginal ending...I don't know what is up with that.     also in the beginning the movie there is a big paragraph about views, opinions and commentary..but..when you go into special features there is no option for commentary...      the deleted scenes answer the questions that the traier left out..The Trailer for the movie shows people who are not even in it and scenes that never hit the screen..the deleted scenes show it...but...there is one still that didn't make it to the deleted scene section.    if anyone bought this movie and or went to see it on the big screen...write back to me...we can discuss it..
B004SKHJF2|3.0|This app works pretty well, it was great I got it for free. However I'm uninstalling and and rating it three stars because I can't install ANY widgets on my phone because of this app. I never would have figured it out if I hadn't googled it and this app was the reason why. Once that glitch is fixed I'd get it again.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|While this disc has some pretty cool and/or interesting songs, there's also several that I could certainly do without. Ofcourse, this is her first disc and most artist's debut albums are either great/legendary or bad/a bust. This one is somewhere in the middle, yet I'll still give it/her credit, labeling \\"19\\" somewhat better than worse (than average). It's worth a listen and can be judged differently from one person to another. Some might love it while others can't stand it. Personally, I like (not love!) it and am glad to have purchased it, but I probably won't be recommending \\"19\\" off the top of my head because I know of (and own) several hundred albums I'd put ahead of it.
1594202842|4.0|This book is a fascinating read.  I read it in two days and I have gone back and forth between finding it utterly fascinating and absolutely cringing at the way she raised her daughters.  I think she does a great job of portraying and explaining her parenting techniques and I admire her daughters for their accomplishments.  I would love one of them to write a follow up in 20 years about how they raised their children and how their relationship is with the Mother.  The one thing I wish she would have written a bit more of is her relationship with her husband.  How in the world he could have sat back and let her raise the girls as she did is a big mystery.  For example-her family goes to Budhapest, gets in early in the morning and rather than going straight to the hotel to get some sleep she makes her daughters take music lessons from a complete stranger.  Why did her husband never stand up for his girls?  He comes across as a bit of a wimp and it is just sad.  In fact-it is one of the things that unsettled me the most.  Was she as demanding on her husband as she was on her daughters?  Why do we never see him advocating for his children?  His wife and daughter get into screaming matches and we never hear about him trying to intervene or sooth his daughters when they get upset. What was he saying to his daughters when his wife was yelling at them for not getting the top grades or not practicing hard enough.  This is a good read and I hope she writes a sequel.
B004EI2NM2|5.0|Best way I can think to describe this film is that it is an American version of a foriegn film. Most of it is in English, though there are plenty of instances of subtitled moments.<br /><br />MOST IMPORTANTLY: this has the plot line of an archetypical foriegn-styled film. If you're just a guy looking for good soft porn, you'll be bored for the majority of the film (though about 90% of the film features the two female leads naked). If you enjoy deep romantic plots where emphasis is placed on the relationship of the characters--and yes a fair amount of erotica--then this may be an excelent choice for you.<br /><br />Two strangers, one hotel room, and a night together in Rome.

B004EBT5CU|3.0|This album has better, more clear production when compared to her debut album and is pretty interesting too. I believe \\"21\\" is/was a pretty good step in her career, yet I'm not absolutely amazed by either of her discs yet. Ofcourse, I look forward to more, yet I'm not really sure how much more change we'll be hearing from her next album/s, ya know? \\"21\\" is a good album, but not consistently good (as in, from one song to the next) overall, so I can only hope for an even better album coming from her soon. Let's have \\"23\\" or \\"24\\" (or whatever Adele's next album might be called) explode into this world as a \\"classic\\" that'll shock and impress even her biggest fans AND critics! Yeah, that could be too much to ask, but if Adele really is a great artist, it should be expected and/or demanded! Period!

B004A8ZWT2|4.0|This film isn't going to be for everybody. I can see how someone who was not interested in the extreme eye candy here (in my case that would be Venice... and Depp...) could say it was a little bit slow. It takes time to \\"smell the roses\\" not only of Venice but the glamorous and elegant, which I have to say even though I don't like Jolie she pulls off extremely well in this film. There is incredible cinemetography here, an interesting plot that will leave you guessing, and some good action sequences. I rented the movie for the first viewing and after seeing it plan to buy it for repeated viewings. I can't give it five stars though because there are some questions left in my mind in the plot, loose ends that never get tied up, like how Alexander knows Elise will go so far down the train and choose to sit with him instead of any of the guys ahead of him. But all in all, things like that are minor and forgettable compared to the unforgettable scenery, outstanding costume design, charm of Depp, and the fact that this film is dripping with elegance. I felt opulent joining them on this journey.

B0018QOIXU|4.0|I heard Adele on CD \\"21\\". I did like it. I bought this one. CD \\"19\\" presents itself MUCH more melodic, jammy and natural. I do hear some distortion in some highs even on my hi-end system. I don't know if this is on purpose but it sounds annoying. Otherwise 5 stars.

B003E6K1VK|3.0|This is not your ordinary Audiophile point of view. This is not a review about Fiio exactly and its not a comparison to other amplifiers. And maybe it should be, but I figured I would describe my setup given the popularity of my situation.    For the love of the music I find myself here at this point in time. An ipod, apple earphones, a Senheisser HD 555, a Senheisser HD 598 and this Fiio 7 amplifier.     The evolution that has got me here is not because im an audiophile per se, but I somehow got here because im partly a gadget kind of guy and partly because I wanted a better sound.     The spark in this fire came about when I originally upgraded my Apple earphones for the Sennheiser HD 555. An entry point into quality headphones. The difference was both remarkable and measurable to the untrained ear. Sounds I'd never heard, reverb in chords that were strum, backing vocals I'd never discerned, voices from outside the 'boxing ring' that I never even noticed. Beats with diamters Id call it. A more vibrant and clearer sound. Made music so much better. There was no doubt. At home, I used them everyday.      Then I bought myself the Senheiser 598 + fiio 7 combo.     1. The Senheiser 598 vs 555 (no amplification using ipod)    Simply put, the sound is different. Better.. hmm? Its hard to even say that. The 555 is pushing itself no doubt, but that gives it character. There is rawness to the acoustics on the 555. The 598 is in cruise control. The 598 is reproducing the sound better, at certain moments yes, but does that make it more fun better. Its completely subjective. I cant tell you that green is a better colour than blue. I can only tell you that 598 is probably more accurate to its source.     So how is the Fiio 7 with the Senheiser 598 (ipod)    The Fiio 7 gives the sound more dimension. There are sounds you will notice that you never noticed before. That isnt to say you cant hear them if you disconnect the fiio 7, but the Fiio feels like it separates the layers of sound. Almost a more 3D fuller sound. There are channels! Without it, the sound is more tinnier. With it, its cruising even more. What I can say is that the Fiio makes the sound better, in a way I cant say when I compare the 598 with the inferior 555. I know that doesnt make sense. But thats just how I hear it.     But then to the practicality. The difference here with the Fiio is small. If you are running around, being portable I cant see how you will honestly notice this. I notice this sitting in a dark room switching jacks over and over again to the Flaming Lips - Fight test (a band known for their production quality, heck they even released that infamous album with 4 CD's which they asked their listeners to play simultaneously on 4 different stereos!). But honestly, within a few minutes your brain cant remember the 'other sound', and you really have to concentrate on the sound to notice the difference. As it stands, an iphone jacked up to the fiio 7 is impracticle, clumsy, and not worth it. Walking around with another 'iphone' sized gadget is annoying.     And there you go. I know Im going to be spanked by all the audiophiles telling me about the ipod not being a good source (to use a line out jack) etc but this review is specifically for all those people who are thinking about this sort of setup. For the love of the music.    Would I buy the fiio 7. I dont know. Is the Hd 598 better than the HD 555. I dont know. Its not a wow upgrade thats for sure. And maybe thats what I'll conclude this with. Its not a wow upgrade from Hd 555 to HD 598 and Fiio 7.        apple earphones to senheiser --> wow!

0062502182|4.0|The fable, the tale, the alchemist  \\"The Alchemist,\\" is the kind of novel that tells you that everything is possible as long as you want it to happen. When young Santiago decides to leave his family is, his father's only advice is, \\"travel to the world until you see our castle is the greatest, and our women the most beautiful.\\"   During Santiago's journey he meets many exciting people like a gypsy, a man who calls himself a king and \\"The Alchemist,\\" all help him on his way.  During all this, Santiago leaves his homeland Andalusia, Spain for the Egyptian desert. In search of his \\"personal legend\\" and of course hid treasure buried near the pyramids.   Thru Santiago's journey more towards the end of the book, he realizes that the journey itself was itself the treasure. The knowledge, wisdom and understanding that came with it were the biggest gift. This also meaning \\"treasure lies where your heart belongs.\\" Which is a message that everyone wants to believe?  This book expresses that through many things, in meeting many people and traveling many miles that a higher understanding may be gained, of all things. This book thus being recommended to those in search of wisdom and understanding and deeper understanding. Also those who want to understand why some beliefs are the way they are and what kind of relationship people have with their beliefs. Although not highly recommended to those who are not interested in that sense of understanding. That's why many favorites and not so favorite things are found in \\"The Alchemist.\\"  \\"The Alchemist,\\" reaches into all aspects of life which is why it's a national best seller.  Over 65 million copies sold; to over 150 country's making \\"The Alchemist,\\" one of the bestselling books in history. Originally sold in Portugal, written In Portuguese, this book was then translated into 67 different language's giving it the world record for most translated book by a living author, so with all that considered this book would be and is of course considered to be a great read.  Making this a 5 star book in many eyes, \\"The Alchemist,\\" the story of a young Shepard pursuing his dream, an overall fantastic read.

0307270807|5.0|This seminal account of the Vietnam War is a classic in the field and a 'must read' for anyone looking to understand that conflict.<br /><br />Michael Bear<br />Author 'Forest of Assassins'<br />[[ASIN:1460962745 Forest of Assassins]]
B0045ODPKY|2.0|This is a typical Hollywood commercial \\"product\\" (as opposed to a work of art) which is cynically designed for one purpose, to get people to buy movie tickets by offering what the audience is thought to want; violence-porn. So a lot of bloody beatings and shootings, car chases and special effects, a hot babe who can beat up guys, and a lot of fake techno talk. The 'plot' is so absurd and implausible as to be funny in parts; something about Russian sleeper agents in the US, and absolutely everyone working for the US government eventually turns out to be one of them. Or something - they lost me on the details. Hasn't anyone told these people that the Cold War was over, er, some time ago?<br /><br />But viewers don't seem to care. From a business angle, this piece of dreck brought $300M in revenues against a budget of $100M for production. I find this offensive. In no other industry (ie, honest hardworking industry) could such an indifferently conceived product earn two hundred million in a year. Hey, following the porn model, why not just give up any pretense of a story and film pure violence for two hours? Sad commentary on the Hollywood business model.<br /><br />Now that I got that off my chest, Angelina is kind of fun in this movie, playing the James Bond instead of the James Bond chick. Pretty good for a scrawny 36 year old mother of six, although to keep her lips puffed up like that they must have brought in a 55 gallon drum of bee venom. Liev Schreiber is an excellent actor. And it was clever of her to steer the runaway police car by systematically tasering the driver; taser left to turn right, taser right to turn left, taser front to stop, taser back to accelerate. Creative, although the poor cop is definitely going to need some extended disability leave. So turn off your brain and watch for escape value.

B003Y74KAW|4.0|A relative of mine in Massachusetts bought an iPhone 4 last year and got a rather generic gel-style cover for it. (Like many people, she was terrified of dropping it, because it was so thin and shiny.) It worked well for the first 6 months, but when I saw her I noticed that she wasn't using it. \\"Oh, it got all loose and didn't fit snugly any more. In fact it was more of a hazard than a comfort.\\" So when this AmazonBasics silicone case popped up on Vine, I ordered one and had it shipped to her. Her verdict so far: much better made, fits nicely, not too bulky, and no sign so far of stretching or slipping. And what more can you ask of a basic iPhone case? Recommended.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|Orphan is a thrilling ride that'll have you glued to the screen avoiding any interruption.  The actress playing the role of the Orphan is so convincing as the creepiness surrounding her builds to a wonderful climax.  She really deserves an award of some type.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the entertainment quality of Orphan. The movie gives enough backstory to the characters to make the story more convincing and fulfilling.  Its that disturbing type of horror movie that makes you wish for a freddy krueger or jason, because they couldn't possibly be real. Orphan seems all too horrifically real. A really bad seed that only a mother can love. Or can she? Excellent Movie!

0689865384|5.0|Take perfection, and the desire to be perfect too far, and you have The Uglies series. Uglies is the first book in this series, and it is amazing. Filled with action, romance, suspense, and an honest truth about where our society could be headed, this book will leave you craving more, while re-thinking your own self-image.<br /><br />This book follows Tally as she prepares for her 16th birthday, the operations that will make her \\"Pretty\\" and allow her to live with the rest of the pretties. She spends her time finding flaws in her face and body, hating her natural self, and dreaming about the cosmetic upgrades she'll get once her life \\"begins.\\" One night of adventure and fear change her life forever.<br /><br />She finds people on the outside- people who never become \\"pretty.\\" What's more, she finds herself, and starts seeing things for the way they're meant to be. Natural. Especially when she finds a young man who sees her as beautiful without the upgrades. Her whole world shifts, and life hands her a crossroads. Turn in her traitor friends (as criminals), or never turn pretty. Can she give up her life-long dreams to save her friends, or will she give in, and forget the natural beauty she started to find?<br /><br />This book takes you on a wild adventure of self-discovery, both for Tally, and yourself. Personally, I loved this book. The future world Mr. Westerfeld created is awesome, and I adore the hover-board scenes. I would love to live in this world, surviving on the outside, but with a hover-board to have fun with! I would certainly recommend this book, and series, to anyone who enjoys dystopian adventures.

B000M341QE|1.0|*** This was copied from a review by LamCui@hotmail.com, with which i agree 100%.    *** This review may contain spoilers ***    Ever since I have seen Infernal Affairs (IA), I said to myself that Hollywood would not pass up on a story like this. And true enough, I heard Brad Pitt bought the rights to the show and that he and Tom Cruise are slated to act in it. When I heard that the whole ensemble changed, I still was looking forward to the film. IA, with a much smaller budget, looks more expensive than The Departed (TD).    Character development -IA, is all about heart. It is about how the mole in the police, Ming, is torn between his identity as a mole, and his conscience, and the mole in the mafia/gangland, Yan, is torn between doing right for the police and his own dilemma about his identity. Ming is not bad, nor is Yan good. TD, like all other Hollywood cop movies, is about black and white. Costigan is wholesomely good, and Sullivan is utterly bad. Their characters are so one-dimensional, it's almost like the screenwriter doesn't trust his audience to be intelligent enough to know that good and evil are degrees of grey.    Timeframe - The time frame is just ridiculous in TD. Are we expected to believe that in the short span of 4 months, Costigan is able to infiltrate the mafia and become Costello's left hand man, given that everyone (so 'cleverly' explained by Queenan) knows that he was a cop and that Costello doesn't trust people easily? Are we also to believe that Sullivan can rise through the ranks of the police force so fast, considering that (also 'cleverly' explained by Ellerby) they don't trust people with perfect records? In IA, it is a convincing many years. Both characters are allowed to grow into their environment enough to be torn. TD just throws it in our face.    Acting - How can people say that the acting is superb? Matt Damon doesn't emote at all. Leo Dicarprio is so whiny, if he isn't whining to Queenan, he is whining to the shrink, or Costelloand Mr. French. Martin Sheen is like a vase, so weak and wimpy, he doesn't have the air befitting of a Captain. Mark Wahlberg's character, sarcastic as hell, for what? It's a wonder that he is even there, he has no role to play at all. An omission of his character wouldn't have made the movie any less. The shrink sleeps with both Costigan and Sullivan, and we are expected to feel sorry for her? And Jack Nicholson, so painful to watch. Even the extras are so miscast-ed. The Mainland Chinese characters are so obviously 3rd generation Cantonese speakers, with the American accents, I am not a native Cantonese speaker and even I know it's all wrong.    Screenplay - This has to be one of the worst screenplays ever.    a. Costello, if he is a big time gangland boss, and that he is dealing with international crime lords, why is he and his right hand man still going round the hood to collect protection money? The writers cannot decide if he is a big-time crime lord or a smalltime mafia boss.    b. the time-line.    c. Costigan sends the tape to Madolyn, gets Sullivan to meet him at the building Queenan died, and expects to do what? It is just a cheap shot at trying to mirror IA's intelligent rooftop scene.    d. The fact that the cast says F*** every other second makes the movie cheap and crude instead of realistic.    e. the subplots are so unnecessary and so poorly intertwined. The double crossing of the mainland Chinese, the FBI informer subplot, the letter that was never heard of again, the love triangle between moles & shrink, the time in cadet school. All these subplots should be omitted, then maybe the director can concentrate on the real story.    f. What's up with the ending? First Costigan is shot (Which is a ripped off from the original), and then everyone else gets shot in the head except Sullivan. Is there a need for all that gore? Or is it just cheap thrill? And then Dignam kills Sullivan. Does Dignam have a great enough agenda to do what he did?     g. Did Imention that a lot of scenes of the movie are ripped off from the original? Even the dialog of some of the scenes is directly translated from the original. I read that the writer claims that he didn't see the original. Is he trying to claim the great parts of the movies as his own? Isn't that plagiarism? Which brings me to     Production value - Scorsese bombed, big time. He has ran out of tricks, the movie started out good, but the ending seemed so rushed, like he has ran out of time, or interest. I love GoodFellas, and his style and techniques at that time seem fresh and ingenious. But the second time he used the pinhole effect in TD, I realize that Scorsese has ran out of ideas. There are even scenes that he took from the original shot by shot, making it seem like he cannot make his own out of the material.    Over all I am very MAD. MAD at the people who say this movie is brilliant. It is brilliant only because the original is brilliant and they had taken almost every element of it. I am MAD because of the disregard of respect on the part of Scorsese's team, not giving the credits when credits are due. Is he going to get an academy award for something that is not his? Something that he so blatantly took from someone else and did not even bother to credit? That would say a lot about Hollywood and their disregard for anyone else. I am MAD at the way the movie ended and I am just disappointed that the audiences are treated like idiots and they don't know it.

B0000025DR|5.0|They asked me for a review, so. I got this album when it first came out back in about 1974.  It is a good solid album from start to finish, If you Liked \\"Evil Woman\\" you'll like this album.  All the songs are of the same caliber as the hit song,     This album is much better than the Euro-Disco-Trash that ELO began farting out in the late 70's and early 80's    I mean, you listen to the radio and you hear garbage like, \\"Brrruce, Don't let me down, Brruddce\\" PURE TRIPE!! compared to the excellent music on \\"Face the Music\\" and a couple more albums that followed it which were also very good.      Fortunately, ELO died a well deserved death, which freed Jeff Lynne to go on to do some realy good work with the Traveling Wilbury's, and George Harrison.    But to me, this is their best album, back when they were a Unique Orchestral Rock and Roll Band.

B000002UA5|4.0|This is a strange album, to say the least. I am an avid Pink fan and I only gave it 4 stars because, even though I love this album, there is some stuff on here that I can't listen to anymore since I can no longer find access to LSD!<br /><br />Now, if you were tripping, the whole album was GREAT. But if you are now unfortunate enough to be residing in the &#34;Real World&#34; (as I am) It's just very good.<br /><br />The live section is a solid 40 minutes of Very Good Pink Rocking hard at that point in their development when David Gilmore was really starting to gel with the band after Syd Barret's exit.<br /><br />The Studio part of the CD has a couple of real Gems,Roger's &#34;Grandchester Meadow&#34; and what I think is the highlight of the album, David's &#34;The Narrow Way&#34; one of my all time favorite Pink songs.<br /><br />Once again, this album is for the dedicated Pink Floyd fans, who are brave enough to travel back into the Deep, Dark, Mysterious past, and face the mad Welshman Howling his disdain into the wind. (at least, I think it's Welsh)

The detail is amazing -- texture of skin, all the folds and wrinkles.

B0000035E7|3.0|This album certainly has highlights but prepare yourself for an unsteady, rocky run while playing the album as it is inconsistent at best.  Many of the songs are emulating The Melvins, the recording was brief and quick with very little polish that shows, and the songs aren't treated quite as seriously by Kurt. Chad doesn't hit the drums as hard as Dave Grohl but he fits the attitude of the album better than Grohl would have. The album has many songs that show glimpses of potential but are buried under uninspired lyrics (Kurt would later say he didn't understand the importance of lyrics when this was recorded) and Kurt's desire to emulate his bigger influences at the time.    01: Blew - One of the more memorable intros and Kurt shows his Beatles love here with the chorus. The kind of song that made the band stand out from their sludge/grunge metal contemporaries. Would be considered poppy if not for the tuned down instruments.    02: Floyd the Barber - A song that really isn't taken seriously lyrics wise and hurts the song overall. The riff eventually dissolves into a typical grungey metal riff that does not hold up on repeated listens.    03: About A Girl - Another standout track with Kurt mentioning he wrote it after listening to The Beatles and it absolutely shows. Much like Blew, if not for the tuned down instrumentation this could have been thought of as a Nevermind B-Side. This song would also start a formula for Kurt of mid-tempo rockers that suited his voice better.    04: School - A song with a pretty memorable guitar riff and intro but gets a bit bogged down by the lyrics. A song that could have been much better with focused lyrics but instead merely stands up as an average to solid song. The solo also reflects Kurt's metal influence more so than other songs.    05: Love Buzz - The song probably most reminiscent of the sound they would get on Nevermind. The guitars aren't nearly as heavy and the song is a solid cover. Like School, the song is merely solid and doesn't quite rise above that status.    06: Paper Cuts - A song heavily influenced by The Melvins and it shows. The topic matter is one that Kurt would also use on Polly (a story ripped from the headlines) but the song is dragged down by an unmemorable guitar riff and sludgy grind that just drags overall. Kurt's vocals are really the only thing holding the song together and it's tenuous at best.    07: Negative Creep - Very similar to School but the sludgy instrumentation and lyrics hurt the song. Kurt would go on to write better songs with similar punk style aspects (Breed) and on the same subject matter (Been A Son). Real shame because if the song had been fine tuned over a week or two, it could have rivaled Blew and About A Girl as a memorable track.    08: Scoff - An uptempo feel that is paired with a somewhat unmemorable guitar riff. Another song in which the lyrics and slowed down, sludge aspect hurt it more than help. Like School, it's a song that has potential in areas but just wasn't treated enough to show it.    09: Swap Meet - One of the better songs. The guitar riff is pretty memorable and Kurt's vocals shine out nicely here but yet again, the lyrics don't quite stand up to what the subject matter could have provided.    10: Mr. Moustache - Another song that had a decent enough guitar riff but is buried under uninspired lyrics and Kurt's vocals treat the song more as a punk song in the vein of Negative Creep and it overall leaves almost no impression after the fact.    11: Sifting - Very similar to Paper Cuts in that the heavy influence of The Melvins is apparent from the get go. The guitar riff is pretty unmemorable and the lyrics show potential to be interesting but don't really revolve around a consistent theme and meander along much like the song itself does.    12: Big Cheese - One of my favorite tracks because it stands out from the others. There's a strong start/stop dynamic, Kurt's vocals stand out well, and the riff gets more memorable as the song continues although again the lyrics don't quite stand up to the subject matter. You can see a bit of the influence in the instrumentation that would appear more strongly on In Utero as there's a bit of a chaotic sense to the song as a whole.    13: Downer - A memorable guitar riff and decent chorus buried in a straight ahead punk song with lyrics that don't quite stand out. Again, the song's tempo and punk aim doesn't match Kurt's vocal stylings very well and it's easy to see why this was initially unreleased and put on Incesticide instead.    As I said earlier, there are some tracks that stand out on the whole (Blew, About A Girl, Love Buzz, Big Cheese) but most of the songs only show glimpses of Kurt's evolution as a song writer in song arrangement or lyrics. Worth seeking out if you want to see the early era of Nirvana before Nevermind but Incesticide shows a similar and better glimpse of that with songs like Dive, Stain, Hairspray Queen, and Big Long Now.
B0029QRA1U|1.0|I ordered this turntable to replace an old one because the price was right and the software sounded user-friendly. True in both cases, and the audio quality is genuinely good. I was very pleased with the purchase, until, about two months after purchase, it started malfunctioning. I would go to play a record, and as I was moving the arm to the record (there is no \\"start\\" button, only a \\"stop\\" one-- a definite issue that I wish I'd been aware of), I would feel something catch and it would push the arm back to the cradle. Time after time, it would keep pushing the arm back to the cradle, over and over, no matter if I lifted it high or low. It got, needless to say, very irritating. When I contacted the manufacturer, I was told that it was a mechanical issue and that I would have to return it to them for repair--on my dime, and which would take two to four weeks. Instead, I contacted good ol' Amazon, who of course sent a free replacement right away.    That one worked for about two weeks, until I started noticing a decreasing quality in the sound of my records-- odd volume modulations, distortion, etc. At first I thought it was my speakers or receiver, but when I switched to radio or CD, they sounded great. Nope, it was my wonderful Ion turntable again.    I'm returning it for the second time, this time for just a refund, which I'm applying towards the purchase of a Sony. What a POS. You get what you pay for, guys.
B000FGGE7C|5.0|The picture is stunning in blu ray. And of course the movie is action packed. Bottom line one of my favorites.
0670022411|4.0|Surprisingly easy to read despite passages of explanation.  As I continued through the book, I realized that the book left open the door for more books to follow.  That is good and bad.  Good in the way we can continue to enjoy the story and the characters, but bad in the fact that we will have to wait for another book! Well worth the time and money.
B004LWZVZM|5.0|In the days following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the administration saw to it that the people involved were hunted down like dogs. But in their thirst for \\"justice,\\" some that were possibly innocent also became victims of the war. One of those was Mary Surratt, mother of John Surratt, one of the conspirators. The trial of Mary Surratt and five other conspirators is the subject of the courtroom drama \\"The Conspirator,\\" the first film from The American Film Company. Directed by Oscar winner Robert Redford, the film features an all-star cast including Robin Wright (\\"The Princess Bride\\") as Surratt; James McAvoy (\\"The Chronicles of Narnia,\\" \\"Wanted\\") as Civil War veteran and Surratt attorney Frederick Aiken; Danny Huston (\\"John Adams,\\" \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\") as prosecutor Joseph Holt; Tom Wilkinson (\\"John Adams,\\" \\"The Patriot\\") as Reverdy Johnson; and Kevin Kline (\\"Silverado,\\" \\"Dave\\") as Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.<br />The film begins with a well-staged recreation of the assassination of Lincoln, as well as the attempted assassinations of Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward. The film then quickly goes through the chase and death of Booth, and the arrests of the other conspirators involved. But the bulk of the film is taken up by the trial of the conspirators, and it is here where the film really shines. The acting, cinematography and directing all come together perfectly in these scenes, creating a vivid portrayal of the trial, and showing how this was not really a case of finding the truth, but of finding all those on trial, including Surratt, guilty and sentenced to death.<br />While all the performances in the film are terrific, the best comes from Kevin Kline's portrayal of Stanton. Here, we see a man out for blood, and who doesn't care if a person is possibly innocent or not. Although those on the war tribunal wanted to be lenient on Surratt on grounds of her age and gender, Stanton \\"convinced\\" them to pronounce the death sentence on her. And when Aiken was successful in having a Writ of Habeas Corpus signed by a judge to give Surratt another trial in a civilian court, you can tell that Stanton was the one who convinced President Johnson to have it more or less vetoed. Even if you don't outright hate Stanton, you strongly despise the man, which is a great testament to the acting by Kline.<br />The attention to historical detail is very telling in this movie. From costume design to set decoration to military drill and uniforms, you really get a sense that the production team did their research, creating a 19th Century world vividly. While the film does have one or two inaccuracies (The Writ was given to General Winfield Scott Hancock, not to Stanton), and the film does have its slower moments, \\"The Conspirator\\" is an outstanding film that presents this little-known story from our history with terrific performances, fine storytelling, a strong sense of attention to historical accuracy, and excellent direction from Redford. If you enjoy historical films, then \\"The Conspirator\\" is one you cannot afford to miss!<br />Movie Grade: A-her.

0743289692|5.0|\\"Infidel\\" is the memoir of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a woman born in Somalia and raised in Kenya, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia before migrating -- escaping really -- to Holland.  Her from-the-ground-up experiences in the Muslim world are traumatic and eye-opening and give the reader a sense of the world view of the ordinary people in that tradition. Ali underwent genital mutilation, severe and repeated beatings from her harried mother, abandonment by a beloved father and an arranged \\"ideal\\" marriage to a man she loathed. She was a Muslim woman at a time when the region was becoming radicalized by the Muslim Brotherhood and women increasingly took to wearing concealing clothing. Her experience with the day-to-day bigotry of light-skinned Arab Muslims against their dark-skinned African brothers and sisters was shocking, but perhaps not surprising.<br /><br />Ali's experiences caused her to doubt the truth of her Islamic tradition, the teachings of the Koran and the existence of Allah himself. She asks herself questions that many religious people ask about the purpose of suffering and he point of obedience. She struggles to find a voice in a world dominated by men and maintained by violence. As more and more Muslim refugees pour into Europe, she eventually begins to challenge the hyper-tolerance of her countrymen.<br /><br />Ali asks very hard questions about the ability of fundamentalist Muslims to integrate with the West. How can a culture that allows the domestic abuse of women and reacts to freedom of speech with violence coexist in western societies that are open and promote women's rights? The answers will bring troubled thoughts, especially to those committed to maintaining free societies that are open to all.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I think Nikita may be the most underrated show on TV right now.  Back in September critics hailed it as one of the season's best new shows, and that is what caused me to give it a try.  Since episode one I have been totally hooked!  I can't believe that the CW has already renewed 90210 and the rapidly declining Gossip Girl, but not Nikita!  I watch all three of these shows, but Nikita is by far my favorite, and the only one I would be particularly sad to see cancelled.  It has everything you would want in a show - action, romance, mystery, a solid backstory, suspense, passion, and humor!  It really is unlike any other show on TV right now.  I hate to see it get lost in a sea of cop shows, forensics shows, reality shows, and primetime soap operas.  So many shows today are procedural, where you can skip episodes and still know exactly what's going on when you return.  Nikita is the first show in a while to keep me hanging on the edge of my seat week after week.  So much happens in every episode; you wouldn't want to miss one!  It kind of breaks my heart that the ratings are not where they need to be... And I worry that it will be hard for Nikita to pick up new viewers because it's the kind of show where you really want to start at the beginning of season one rather than tuning in late.  On the plus side, full episodes are available on Hulu.com, so new viewers can catch up there before season two (hopefully!!) premieres in the fall.  If you have never watched, I implore you to do so immediately!!    If you liked any of the following, definitely try Nikita:  Veronica Mars, Buffy, Vampire Diaries, Dollhouse, Angel.

B0036S4C6G|5.0|A Visit From The Goon Squad won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction the day I finished the first third of the book.  Naturally, I started paying more attention.  I realized that the chapters I'd already read, which had seemed like discrete short stories, were related in a more challenging way than my too casual reading would uncover.<br /><br />By the time I'd read eighty percent of the book, I knew I needed to go back and do some re-reading. The earlier chapters were often later in the story.  It was like the film, Memento, only the story didn't flow straight backwards in time-- it jumped around like the chapters were being pulled out of hiccupping randomizing machine.<br /><br />There was San Francisco seen through the lens of members of a high school punk band in the late 1970s, then other college students in New York City in the early 1990s, then a wandering young traveler in Naples in the late 1980s.  Finally a few of these characters are thrown together, this time in the New York City of the not-too-distant future.  A unifying subject is the popular music scene, but you have to put the story together for yourself.  The author brings all of the different times, places, characters, and milieus alive, so you feel like you've read a very thick book.<br /><br />I read the Kindle edition and it colored my experience more than usual.  One chapter, from the point of view of the twelve year old daughter of one of the important characters, consists of powerpoint slides.  Even with the Kindle's ability to enlarge font size and change page orientation, I still found some of the fonts too small and too pale to read.  I could read enough to gets the general sense, but some telling details may have been lost to me. On the other hand, using the search feature to find earlier references to `Alex' for example was really helpful.  More than once I used the dictionary lookup feature.<br /><br />In 1970 a boyfriend in Berkeley who was studying literature at the time, told me how Lawrence Durrell's The Alexandria Quartet pushed the boundaries of the novel by telling a story from four different view points.  Lately books I've read (The Imperfectionists, Lady Matador's Hotel) seem to be short story chapters linked together--with different characters point-of-view.  A Visit From The Goon Squad  takes this trend even further, telling a story about time and music with even more complexity.  There are plenty of disquieting points to think about as you piece together the plot.  Like seeing Memento a few times, I may have to reread this book, to make sure I've completely figured it out.  But, it'll be worth it!artet pushed the boundaries of the novel by telling a story from four different view points.

0345522478|3.0|Well, first the good:  it's an easy reading book, probably written on a junior high school level (no big words, syntax relatively simple).  There are some entertaining characters such as the Irish bloodhound (that communicates with the narrator).  A few of the fights are mildly entertaining, and the end battle I found more interesting.  On the other hand, much of the story is so weak as to be overly fantastic; the Druid is a couple thousand years old; many of the battles or fights are so incredulous as to be rather fake.  I didn't think much of the first 100 pages, but either I got used to it, or it got better.  The big battle with the witches and his main foe (who has been hunting him for several hundred years) was mildly entertaining.   Still, the various gods, deities, or semi-supernatural creatures that continually enter the story are a real stretch of the imagination.  If you want something for total fantasy with not much of a plot or character  development, this novel will do.  I will say this, occasionally the author makes some interesting observations about human nature in comments his main character makes.
0393075966|3.0|Much of this book is what one would expect.  It describes the conditions that caused the financial crisis of 2008, and then it analyzes the measures taken by the United States to address the crisis.  There is little debate among reasonable people about the cause of the crisis.  That the response was unfair, irresponsible and misguided is also not subject to much debate.  Stiglitz has a unique perspective, however, because as an economist at the World Bank and a student of world economics he has seen many crises in other countries over the years as well as responses to said crises.  Despite coming from one of the top economic geniuses of our time, the book is an easy read.<br /><br />In addition to the same-old same-old, the author delves into other issues that warrant discussions after the crisis.  One area of discussion is the author's challenge of basic economic principles and assumptions commonly held by conservatives.  Stiglitz challenges the assumption of an efficient market, citing externalities, imperfect information and the fact that market participants are not always rational (in some cases extremely irrational).  He does not throw out the idea of the market; instead he argues for government policies to correct market failures.  Let's face it; if requirements of higher down payments on homes and higher margins for stock trading had been in effect, there would have been no financial crisis at all.  His main concern is that other countries will, to their detriment, throw out the market concept because of its imperfections rather than seeking policy to overcome its limitations.<br /><br />Stiglitz offers a challenge to using GDP as the primary measure of the economy.  He describes the limitations of GDP and offers other measures.  This is where his unique experience is most evident.  During his time at the World Bank reducing world poverty was one of the top priorities.  While GDP is the be-all and end-all of many economists and politicians, things like life expectancy, health, infant mortality, income distribution and even leisure time were concepts that Stiglitz considered.<br /><br />In one area Stiglitz seems to be unreasonable.  One of his five reasons for poor performance of the nation's financial system is that \\"bankers forgot that they should be responsible citizens.\\"  I think it's unreasonable of Stiglitz to expect a banker or anyone to be a responsible citizen.  It's like saying that terrorists should stop terrorizing and then declaring that you've found a way to stop terrorism.  It's not going to happen.  If there is a way to legally gain wealth, then someone is going to take it.  To assume otherwise is just plain unreasonable.<br /><br />But Stiglitz is ahead of the curve with respect to the future: what is to become of the world economy after the crisis.  Listening to the political discussions some people seem to think that little more than a tax cut is all that is needed for the economy to get back on the track it was before.  Stiglitz argues that we can't go back to the way it was before and that trying to will only delay and worsen the inevitable.  When the nation should have been saving for the baby boomers' retirement, we went on a spending spree consuming beyond our means for decades.  Given that for decades the U.S. economy has been consuming more than it produces and much of the world has been producing in excess of its consumption, Stiglitz argues that this can't continue indefinitely.<br /><br />The economy has changed.  As we move forward we must realize that we can't continue to borrow to fund the appearance of prosperity as we have the past few decades.  Trying to continue that will only make the situation worse.  A new dynamic is going to form, and our public and private institutions are going to be directing this.  The scary thing is that the same people who through their ignorance screwed things up so bad are still in control.xpectancy, health, infant mortality, income distribution and even leisure time were concepts that Stiglitz considered.<br /><br />In one area Stiglitz seems to be unreasonable.

0307341577|5.0|Gillian Flynn's Dark Places is indeed a very dark story.  Odd, antisocial Libby Day is the sole survivor of the massacre of her family 20+ years ago, for which her brother Ben is serving time in prison.  Switching from present day to flashbacks, Flynn paints a depressing portrait of a small midwestern town and its inhabitants, which includes Libby's family of mom Patty, brother Ben, and sisters Michelle and Debby.  Their father Runner, a complete loser and bum, is shown both in flashback and present day.      Libby is contacted by a group called a \\"Kill Club\\", composed of people fascinated by murderers and their crimes and is asked to speak to them.  She does so only for the money they promise, but is quickly drawn into their speculation that Ben may not have been the murderer.  The book chronicles Libby's quest to find the real killer, alternating with scenes from the past leading up to the killings. Libby hears many different versions of what happened or may have happened.  Even Ben keeps some information to himself although it might help him.  The final scenes are devastating, showing how one decision can go so terribly wrong.    Although the story, the town and the characters are all pretty sad, the book is a total page-turner.  I really couldn't put it down.  Flynn is a terrific writer.  I am always amazed by a writer who can take a story like this and make it so mesmerizing.  I would not want to spend a minute with any of her characters but she is able to make them sympathetic and human even when doing the most terrible things.  Her descriptions of places are vivid and memorable.      Highly recommended; don't be put off by the darkness of the story.  This is some very good writing and story-telling that you won't want to miss.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Well I just received my eagle eye converter today.  I was pretty anxious to try it out.  Set up and mapping the keys was very simple.  Just plug it into your pc, load the disc and map how you want you keys!  The set up is nice because it allows you to save 2 mapping schemes.  I would recommend having the game booklet in front of you to make sure you map you keys how you want them.  The mapping system displays a PS3 controller and from there you pick the box you want and select your key!  Very easy!  Even though PSN is down at the moment, I hooked it up using the Razer Deathadder mouse and Cyber Snipa keyboard and tested the set up on some bots.  The keyboard mapping was flawless and the mouse is very accurate, very comparable to playing on PC.  I played CoD4 on PC and tried my eagle eye converter on Black Ops for PS3.  So far, the only thing I noticed was that my mouse was a little jumpy, then I realized I was fidgeting and moving the table with my knees.  Once I figured that out, no more jumpy mouse.  So far so good!!  If you are/were a PC gamer that also plays console, this is a great addition to your fps arsenal!
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS!  A 2010 movie presents five people as candidates for cinematic Devil:  three young men and two women, one young, one middle-aged.  One man is black, which almost certainly exempts him for PC reasons.  Another man is a showy salesman, which would make for an ideal modern-day villain--which is also too obvious.  Another is a blue-collar type who creates bad vibes with the black guy, thus making him a perfect anti-hero for liberal Hollywood.  But wouldn't this be a dead giveaway?  Then there's the femme fatale who has a history of blackmailing rich men.  Oh, devilish indeed--and too easy.  So that leaves the senior female.  A security camera did catch her lifting a wallet, but maybe her Social Security doesn't suffice, poor old thing.  Traditionally, she would definitely be the least likely candidate.  But, in contemporary terms, isn't she an evil symbol of all that's holding back the cultural revolution and all that?    Modern movie themes are often hampered by the implications inherent in all these characters, and, in horror film, such strictures necessarily dampen the potential for suspense and surprise.  As it is, contemporary flicks about the paranormal struggle with the presentation of religion-based good and evil.  Christianity has for decades become more and more a taboo-fraught subject, so that any modern cinema that deals with the Devil seldom demonstrates even a moderate grasp of dogma and popular tenets concerning this being.  In this film, for example, beliefs about Satan are presented in a folk-religious context, as peasant mythology and primitive superstition.  The only prayer uttered is in Spanish--without subtitles.  The words of the entreaty apparently are of no import in this plot, in any language.  They are to be construed as mumbo-jumbo and nothing more.  The Devil--the ultimate and powerful enemy of all mankind--could just as well have been a malevolent goblin.  (The title even fails to credit the entity as THE Devil, leaving tointerpretation the possibility of a demon or even a bad person.)  Instead of enlisting the powers of the priesthood against the forces of hellfire, the cops call in the fire department.  Instead of getting the Devil out of the building, they strive only to get the surviving humans out of the elevator.      For a well-acted, decently-directed effort, this movie could have been so much better had its premise embraced the idea of an all-encompassing, supernatural evil.  In this flick, an apology to a man dispels the Devil.  In a genuine horror flim, it would take an apology to God.

Each track affected me such as such:  track 1, \\"Bookends,\\" melodic, brief, the theme, beautiful and :SHRANG!: into \\"Save the Life of my Child\\"...a hymn to the soul, electric teases lightly, aching for more. Track numero three, \\"America.\\" What can I say, it brings tears of joy. It's a part of the film score that is America. Nice, sweet, and relaxing is the transition \\"Overs.\\" In the musique-concrete (?), spoken-word recording of 2 to 3 elderly people we get a remembrance/reality of things past/present in the shape of \\"Voices of Old People.\\" \\"Old Friends\\" continues the theme of remembering one's actual old friends in both title and melody. And to it's titled function, \\"Bookends\\" returns again to finish the album's first movement. \\"Fakin It\\" opens the next movement with it's garagey folky-rock, like Neil Diamond jams and lets an African rhythm take it's place. \\"Punky's Dilemma\\" is our childhood's end, it's so beautiful. Let me just say, the radio may have ruined it, but really stop and listen to \\"Mrs. Robinson.\\" It is weaved into the American mind, a grand folk epic, born on American shores. Getting back to some fun, \\"A Hazy Shade of Winter\\" with it's electric psyche-folk, the British Invasion only wishes it could have written, reminds us to dance and dance with joy. A firework-strummed storytime, that is \\"At the Zoo.\\" Though hinting at New York, it reminds me of myself, growing up and going to the St. Louis Zoo as the song and the remembrance of things passed fades, fades away slowly. A tear sits alone in the corner of your eye as you crack a smile and walk back home renewed. The bonus track \\"You Don't Know Where Your Interests Lie\\" is haunting. A deep dark macabre torch song and back again. You don't where your interest in the movements of the song lies: the beginning, middle or end? That's what I took away from it. Listen to it. Give it a chance, you really might discover something.

B0043ISH6O|5.0|I have been a huge Nine Inch Nails fan pretty much all my life. And I have always loved anything that Trent has done. When I first heard he was doing the score for the Social Network I was pumped, I had no idea it would be as good as it ended up being. Each track fits so well with it's on screen use and I was so thrilled to see it win best original score at the Academy Awards this year. If you are a fan of Trent or Atticus check this out like the movie or not the soundtrack is so worth every penny.
B0015AARJI|2.0|The controller works just fine, with the exception of the durability of the R3 & L3 buttons.<br /><br />I bought an additional controller a year ago (I'm a moderate gamer), and R3 buttons have stopped working while everything else seems to be fine.<br /><br />I bought another additional controller, and the R3 button quit after just 2 days.<br /><br />Sony should really look into this and find a way to fix it. The other alternative is get \\"EA\\" (whose games tend to rely a lot on these buttons) to change their usual configuration. Fwd + X could easily replace the L3 function, and a simultaneous button press for the R3.<br /><br />This is a bad thing for an otherwise flawless product.

B002G1YPH0|4.0|As most everyone else noted, it's physically big. As long as it fits, it's worth the effort. If you're putting a system together and the motherboard has not been installed, it's no big deal, although the instructions are junk but if I figured it out, anyone can. The cooler works very well. No matter how much I've stressed the system, the cpu hums away nice and cool. Bang for the buck, you can't beat it. I'd build another system using this cooler, as long as it fit in the case.
1416583408|4.0|This book is very good if you want to know what's ticking inside your dog. It also breaks a few myths of them as well as some models of training a dog that are not quite up to date. I have a rescued German Shepherd, age guessed at 1, from an SPCA in Texas. He was terribly ill and it took months to get him well as well as aggresive. This book has shown some of the possible problems that would have been overcome. The only down side of the book is the use in many areas of words even I never heard of, and I have a masters degree, design and edit books and writings. I think a rewrite would be very helpful so folks don't put the otherwise excellent information down when only into the book a short way. I hated a few sentences near the end, and I mean her short descriptions of her own dog nearing death. Tough for anyone to read.

B001J64S8E|4.0|This was one of those dark, mysterious episodes which I tend to like. What I didn't like was Chloe's ability to trust strangers so quickly while discounting Clark's judgement.  After all the years of being together...she doesn't like Clark questioning things?  How many times did they break into offices in a questionable way just to \\"get\\" the story behind the mystery?  Many...so Clark following time honored tradition should have been supported by Chloe...even if it meant questioning meteor powered young people.  Yeah, I get she was trying to start a support group for these kids...but how many times did she say...meteor powered people always turned out bad.  And what irritated me most was her comment to Clark....\\"if you had the courage to step forward with your identity like these kids did\\"...(paraphrased)...etc.  I truly dislike it when people question Clark's courage because, in this world, he was raised to keep quiet about his secret.  This was ingrained in him...not only for his own safety, but as it turns out...for the safety of people close to him that could be kidnapped and used to control his powers.  Secrecy about his identity has to be a cornerstone of Clark Kent's life so to throw the courage line at him is unfair. So for me, the writer's direction for Chloe in this episode did not sit well with me cuz it seemed to contrast with her earlier behavior and POV from previous seasons. There wasn't consistency in her character here...and I just don't like her because of this.  This is the season where Chloe's \\"magic\\" starts to wear off on me.  I don't know what was behind Chloe not being in season 10 as a regular...but I can see that it was smart to move her away from Clark.
0061914177|5.0|Gary is very passionate and the book won't do his personality justice, I would highly recommend getting the audio book version of this book.  I never read the paper book and listened to the audiobook.  Great content, but Gary is just very inspiring to listen to.  I am a big fan of read by author audio books, but in this case it was better than most.
0385333846|4.0|I was assigned this book to read for my junior year high school American Literature class.  When first assigned we were told it was a book about the bombing at Dresden.  Our teacher told us that it would probably be one of the most controversial and weird books we will read.  When I delved into this book I was expecting another World War II book with many action and battle scenes with heroic feats, not understanding what my teacher had said about it being controversial and weird.  By the end of the third chapter I came to understand the weirdness and was surprised by the content put forward by Vonnegut.     It starts out slow, with mentions of the bombing and mostly talking about Billy Pilgrim and his life.  I was not expecting this at all.  It goes on and on about Billy and his life before the bombing... and so on.  The novel then brings into play the concept of becoming unstuck from time and the views of the Tralfamadorians.  Vonnegut continues to write about the life of Billy Pilgrim in the style of the Tralfamadorians and only gets to the bombing of Dresden in the last three chapters of the book.  Vonnegut also brings up Jesus Christ and somehow compares Billy to Jesus throughout the course of the book.    Overall this book was not what I expected it to be from the very beginning.  As I said before I was expecting a very action-packed war book with many battle scenes.  This book was nothing like that at all, and it ended up being a very pleasant surprise, with the story of the Tralfamadorians and how he changes his life after the encounter with them. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it very highly to anyone.
B0031N2NFS|5.0|Admittedly, when I first heard the clips from this album before its release, I thought \\"Wait, are these clips from different songs, or the same song again and again?\\"  Since then, I've completely reevaluated the situation.  Given:  The Trials of Van Occupanther is a brilliant album full of catchy songs and what-century-are-we-in? fascinating lyrics.  The Courage of Others is most definitely a step further into that realm, but rather than creating songs that will make for an upbeat and dancey live show, they've somehow managed to distill nearly all of the sadness of humanity's existence into one collection of nearly unbearably down-trodden songs.    That being said, these are beautiful tunes, but if you tried to listen to this album every day, you'd most likely be calling the suicide hot-line every 42 minutes.  The only song approaching a happy vibe is also the shortest and features the lyric \\"On with the laughter when the work is done; It is what it is; A passing work of human hands where faults abound\\".  That's the up-swing here, folks.  But in creating this masterpiece of melancholy, they've put to song something that, I feel, resonates with the great sprawl of human history in a way that's incredible and beyond reproach.  Many people will argue that this album is not their bitter cup of tea, but it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do and should be appreciated in accordance with that.  I look forward to Midlake's future directions!

0061547840|5.0|This book is a real eye-opener. Most business books are sugar coated and gently nudge you to step it up. This one is different and gives it to you straight. One particular theme that is present throughout the book is to not get screwed over, and then when someone does try to, get revenge and hit them back 15 times harder. Wow!, right? There are even some warnings in the front of the book that the book is a little gritty. Anyhow, after reading some examples and Donald's explanations, you really realize that many people's lives are ruined because they don't seek revenge when they get screwed. They get a reputation as a pantywaist, which leaves a mark on their back. Now, who can disagree with that? After I read the main chapter about revenge, I reflected on my own experience and could think of at least a few people who lost a fortune because they didn't get revenge. BTW, Trump's not saying to get revenge outside any legal methods.     Besides that, Donald has lot's of other advice that is well worth applying to business and even just life in general. The book is a fun read, and Bill Zanker's input offers some solid advice from a slightly different perspective.     Good read!

1594202842|4.0|By the time I began reading this book, I had seen Amy Chua on plenty of talk shows and heard her vilified in many different media, so I was a little biased and expected to be horrified. But I was pleasantly surprised by Chua's self-deprecating wit and willingness to show a side of herself that is not always flattering. And although I hold to a much more laissez-faire philosophy of parenting, I was able to see the world from her perspective and learn from it.    I was even a bit inspired by her view that by expecting excellence from her children she is showing faith in their abilities. She demands perfection because she believes that they are capable of it. I particularly liked a discussion of one of Lulu's piano practice sessions: a long, painful affair for both mother and daughter that began to seem futile, but ended with Lulu's mastery of a particularly difficult section. It reminded me that it even when a task seems extremely difficult, it is often fruitful to push through and keep working. I was reminded a little of Malcom Gladwell's Outliers, and the fact that sometimes the difference between \\"good\\" and \\"great\\" is not just talent, but also hours of hard work.    I admire Chua's willingness re-evaluate her strategies when they seem to backfire. She ends the book but makes clear that the story will continue, and the suitability of her parenting decisions will be seen as her daughters mature.    The book is enjoyable, short, and provocative, and I recommend it to any parent.

B004J4WQ46|4.0|I loved the Strokes debut, thought the second was good, never could get into the third (other than the first two or three tracks).  For me, this one is a very solid CD, one that I can listen to without skipping any songs (OK, well maybe one or two, depending on my mood).  It is great to hear how they have returned to form without copying the style of their debut CD.  There are actually flashes of all their prior work in this new effort.  And while it doesn't quite reach the glorious heights of Is This It, it is a consistently solid recording, and probably their second best overall.  Machu Piccu, in particular, is amazing.  Angles gives me faith that the Strokes are back on the road to awesomeness!
B002ZG99G8|2.0|You remember the A-Team, right? They were ex-United States Army Special Forces personnel branded as war criminals for \\"crimes they didn't commit.\\" The Losers is a lot like that.<br /><br />Oh, there's different actors of course: the guy who looks like George Clooney (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the guy who looks like Ryan Reynolds (Chris Evans as Jensen), the angry African-American (Idris Elba), and a motley hodgepodge of other stereotypes (the Silent Sniper, the Guy With a Family, the Tough Hot Chick). They are all good soldiers who are also good at what they do, but when a smarmy rich villain (Jason Patrick as Max) tries to eliminate them by blowing up a  helicopter full of children, the team decides to disappear until the Tough Hot Chick (Zoe Saldana as Aisha) gets the old team back together again.<br /><br />There are two good things about this movie.  One is Saldana, who steals every scene she's in.  Tough, emotionally wounded, and with a feline menace that she amply displayed in Avatar, Saldana makes everyone else look like a mumbling gorilla.  The other is Evans, who's miscast as geeky awkward type - he's too good-looking to be convincingly geeky and too quick-witted to be believably awkward, but he nails every scene. If the movie was just about these two The Losers would be winners.<br /><br />But it's not.  Instead, we get a curiously overinvolved villain who shoots his minions when they make a mistake (yawn), a chief henchman who has little to do, a tone that veers from awful (kids blown to bits by a missile) to cheeky (Jensen hilariously fails to infiltrate the villain's corporate office) to unbelievable (THE SPOILERS: who knew sniping a motorcycle could cause it to fly over the head of the hero and smash into an oncoming airplane?). The Losers wants comic-book violence and sensibilities but frequently veers into R-rated territory.<br /><br />The Losers also has grand ambitions of being the beginning of a franchise, so it wraps up exactly nothing: not the villain, not our heroes' plight, and certainly not anything we care about.  Dead children are unavenged, improbable weapons of mass destruction don't go off, and our compensation is seeing Max robbed on a bus.  It's a sad state of the action movie industry when the best we can hope for is that the rich villain takes public transportation.d certainly not anything we care about.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|The movie adaptation was good, don't get me wrong, and most of the things from the book were included, but what covered chapters in the book only covered seconds in the movie. Like the Dursley's leaving for example. They all weren't as cold as that. Harry and Dudley ended up shaking hands. The movie didn't quite live up to the book, but they never do. If you didn't read the book, you wouldn't understand. It's still a good movie though, if a little disappointing.
B001KP2Y3K|5.0|My first impression of Madeleine was that she belonged to the \\"chanteuse\\" school of jazz vocalists, without the \\"beatnik beret\\" of someone like Rickie Lee Jones or the China doll diva affectations of Diana Krall.    After listening to the entire CD, I draw the conclusion that when it comes to the mainstream, Ms. Peyroux might be too smart for her own good.    But that's a plus in my book...there is an intersection between \\"art\\" and \\"commerce,\\" and Madeleine has found her own \\"sweet spot.\\"    The title of this CD is as close to truth in advertising as you're ever going to get...it's bare bones, stark instrumentation that highlights the vocals, and that works just fine.    Madeleine's vocal range isn't \\"wide,\\" but it's not monotone, either. It's right for Madeleine, and it's right for the songs.    It may take one or more listens to understand the lyrics, and you may never understand them.    But like Lou Reed and a preciously small handful of other artists, she doesn't seem to be in the game to deliver a mindless stream of pop \\"hits.\\"    Enjoying this one might take some effort on your part. Rest assured, it will be worth it.

It gives us a glimpse into the early relationships of our favorite characters but the storyline is so creative that all Star Trek enthusiasts can jump on board without hesitation.

B004AQR29C|4.0|I expected this movie to be horrible.  It far outweighed my expectations.  Still not the best action movie I have ever seen, but it was pretty awesome.  Wonderfully done.  Wonderfully acted.  It goes to show you don't have to be 20 or 30-something to be an action star.  Though, I thing the cameo by Arnold made him look horrible.  But, as for the rest of the movie, definately well worth seeing.  Sly Stone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Steve Austin, Eric Roberts, and more.  Very impressed with their perfomances.  Cameos by Mickie Rourke, Arnold Schwarzenager, and Bruce Willis.  I would recommend this movie if you like the action flicks like Die Hard or The Last Boyscout, or Red.  Worth watching at least once.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|I never cared much for modern music, but after discovering these ladies on YouTube while looking for someone else, I LOVE IT!!!  They are an absolutley perfect blend of classical music with a totally modern bend, and they are GREAT!

B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie turned out SO much better then I expected.  It's a typical action flick, with old actors.  Some WAY past their prime.  But, well done, and well played.  A few corny scenes, and a few over the top scenes, but well done by the director.  And whoever thought of over-the-hill action stars against youngsters, was brilliant.  I enjoyed this movie very much, as did my fiance.  He didn't hold his breath that it would be any good, and he was very surprised also.  I usually don't like John Malkavich, but would watch this movie with him in it again.  He plays a paranoid crazy guy VERY well, which he has prooved over and over.  And, I would have never pegged Helen Mirrin as a mean Momma!  She kicks butt with her scoped rifle and everything.  And both Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis have prooved that age doesnt necessarily mean only father, grandfather, and president roles.  It was wonderful throwing in Mary-Louis Parker as a love interest that gets pulled into a strange life.      I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action flicks with a bit of comedy.  If you liked the Die Hards and The Last Boyscout type movies, you will like this one.

I received this book on time and perfect condition, I recommend it to anyone who are amused by unusual and bizarre humor.
0061726826|4.0|In her novel \\"Delirium\\", Lauren Oliver has crafted a dystopian world where love is considered a disease. Romeo & Juliet is no longer taught as classic literature or a tale of love, instead, it's a cautionary tale used to warn school children of the dangers of love. In this world, love makes you crazy and love can kill you. At least that is what the government is telling everyone. That's why, at the age of eighteen, everyone has a procedure which removes the portion of the brain that allows a person to love.<br />Before the procedure, the teens are interviewed, and it is decided where they will attend college and what they will study. They are also \\"matched\\" to their future spouse. Their lives are planned out for them, and they should never, ever resist this.<br />Lena is just finishing up her senior year of high school and will have her procedure in the fall. She is looking forward to it. She has bought in to everything she has been told, and is eager to be \\"cured\\". All that changes once Lena meets Alex. At first she is afraid to be alone with him. Afraid she may become \\"infected\\", but soon she begins to realize that maybe love isn't a bad thing. Problem is, her procedure date is growing ever closer, and once it's done, she'll become an unfeeling shell of her former self, and Alex will be gone.<br />This book was very well written, and the characters strongly developed. The world that Oliver has created, though fiction, seems so real. I found myself thinking about the situation these people have been put in. I can't help but think it could possibly happen. The book is both thrilling and heartbreaking and I am eagerly awaiting the next in the series.
0345347951|1.0|As always, Clarke has a few interesting ideas, but his prose is deadly dull. Tone of the book was depressing. The story was bereft of anything valuable. Maybe the story would have been more interesting if humans would have at least attempted a war with the aliens. I gave my copy to the public library after I bought it. Yawn.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|The Mist<br />Directed by Frank Darabont<br />Starring Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Andre Braugher, Laurie Holden, Toby Jones<br /><br />Weinstein Company   2007   126 min   Rated R   Sep 16, 2008<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Two-disc set (2 BDs)<br />Region free<br /><br />Frank Darabont hasn't directed many movies, but three of them are in my collection. The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are both adapted from Stephen King stories and so is The Mist. Despite its lower budget, The Mist is another strong entry from Darabont.<br /><br />The thing I like about Stephen King is that most story elements are based in the real world. We can identify with the type of town and the characters who inhabit it. He usually changes one or two things to transport us into another world. In this instance, the other element is the mist. We learn that it has leaked through from an entrance to another dimension, along with some of the creatures from that reality.<br /><br />The exposition is handled well and draws the viewer into the situation. After a brief description of David Drayton's (Jane) home life, he travels into town with his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) and neighbor Brent Norton (Braugher). While the three are shopping in the local supermarket, a man runs in with blood on his face warning that there's something in the mist.<br /><br />Some of my favorite stories examine what happens when society breaks down. Stephen King seems to enjoy writing about it too. The Stand is one of the best novels dealing with the psychological effects of a catastrophe and The Mist delves into the same territory. Imagine the situation. You're in a store and a mist descends outside. A man runs in injured and shouts a warning. Do you listen, or do you ignore the warning and assume it's a natural phenomenon?<br /><br />Some people are deeply rooted in routines. They know how much they earn and live one or two paychecks away from disaster. Their routine means that they rarely have to think about anything out of the ordinary. They may excel in one or two known situations, but be completely out of their depth when facing the unknown. That's when we see who the real leaders are. Who will crumble and who will adapt and remain calm under pressure? Will anyone lose touch with reality completely and start behaving in unpredictable ways? Would you steal to feed your family or kill to protect someone? The Mist shows what happens in just such a situation. The results are interesting to say the least.<br /><br />My favorite character is Ollie (Jones), the assistant manager of the store. He's a great reminder of how people are not always what they seem. Looking like an older version of Radar O'Reilly, he's able to step up and make a difference in a crisis.<br /><br />Darabont doesn't spend a fortune on special effects, but the result is convincing to me. As the story unfolds, we see a variety of creatures. Some of them are close to creatures we know while others are like nothing we have ever seen.<br /><br />Another interesting choice from Darabont is the use of sound in the movie. Most entries in this genre would feature music heavily during every action scene. Darabont chooses to just show the events as they happen without trying to influence our mood with music. There are a few muted sound effects for most of the movie, but nothing more. The result is that we are drawn into the situation even more as if we are left alone to think about how we would handle the situation. The one exception is in the last few minutes of the story when The Host of Seraphim (Dead Can Dance) is played during a pivotal scene. Its impact is greatly enhanced due to the absence of music in the remainder of the movie.<br /><br />Darabont changes King's original ending. It's a brave choice and will annoy a lot of people. King remarked that he wishes he had thought of it. It's a resolution of sorts and it's certainly not typical Hollywood fare.<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br />The Mist Blu-ray package consists of two discs; one showing the movie in color and the other in black and white.

B0013AEDWM|4.0|Not only is Seger a great writer but his music has a feel to it that few can touch. On this album he strikes a  great balance between ballads and rockers. Again for my money only Bruce Springsteen can sing about American dreams lost and found like Seger can
1593272839|5.0|Haskell is a wonderful language - it's functional, strongly typed, elegant, and lovely to code in.  However, to many programmers (even seasoned ones), it's daunting to learn.  As a Haskell programmer trying to spread the joy of Haskell to friends and coworkers, this is a real pain.  However, I have used Learn You a Haskell For Great Good!, by Miran Lipovaca, for some time now to help get others into Haskell, and I'm thrilled that it's finally been published as a physical book by No Starch Press.    First a caution: Learn You a Haskell is not designed for non-programmers - it is not a guide to learn how to program.  Rather, it's a guide for programmers who are used to imperative languages (like C, Java, or even Fortran) to learn about functional languages (and, obviously, Haskell in particular).  What's nice about this book compared to other typical programming guides is that it's engaging to read; it's funny and cute, and the content is consistently clear.  Also, the order in which the material is presented makes sense.    The book starts out with a few chapters on the basics.  Lipovaca shows how to call functions, use lists and tuples, and understand the basic type system.  He goes on to explain pattern matching, recursion, and higher order functions - the bread and butter of functional programming.  The descriptions and examples (and even the doodles) are great.  He goes through the toolkit of many commonly used functions (reverse, zip, map, fold, ...) and shows how to implement them from scratch.    Chapters 6 though 10 focus on actually using Haskell to write real programs.  Modules are covered briefly before a great section on type classes.  These can often be confusing to new Haskell programmers as they are very different from classes in a language like Java, but Lipovaca provides plenty of examples and clear explanations to make the learning process smooth.  Next, input and output is introduced.  Nothing very complicated is addressed - it's limited to basic console and file I/O - but it's more than sufficient to give a pre-monad overview of I/O.  Chapter 10 is almost like a halfway point in the book.  We use what we've learned so far to make a nice, useful, functional program before delving into the deeper type classes that are so critical to advanced Haskell programming.    The next few sections are where LYAH really shines.  Where many Haskell resources introduce monads all at once with little reason for why they exist or how they were designed, Lipovaca builds into them beautifully.  We start with a clear explanation of functors, then applicative functors, then monoids, and finally monads.  It makes the following chapter on some common monads (Reader, Writer, and State) seem downright easy. (I'll admit: I had trouble with the State monad for a while when I was first learning Haskell - I wish I'd read this earlier!)    The book ends with a chapter on zippers that seems oddly out of place.  Where most of the other chapters build from their predecessors, this one had nothing to do with anything from the previous few chapters.  I think it would have been much better suited just before or after chapter 10 than as the climax of the book.    Overall, LYAH is a solid beginner's guide to Haskell.  It covers most of the basics, does a great job with the beginning advanced material, and is fun to read to boot.  I would have liked to see a section on Arrows, as I find myself using them more and more, but I recognize they're still pretty fringe right now, so I see this as only a minor fault.  If you already feel comfortable with applicative functors and monads, this book won't provide much new material for you, but if you're anywhere from having no idea about Haskell to still afraid of the state monad, I highly recommend Learn You a Haskell For Great Good!.

B004P96WJ0|5.0|This review is for everyone wondering about the audio and video quality of this release in comparison to the original blu-ray releases.    NOTE: no comparison is made for Sym #7 as I only own the DVD of that symphony.    1)  Video quality on all discs is identical to this release.  Even though discs 1-3 now have double the content, they are on BD 50s and have the exact same bit rate  and have the same strengths and weaknesses.  Symphony #3 looks the best with Sym #6 a close 2nd, again just like the original releases.       2) Audio quality:  The Big Issue!   First off, the back of the box makes it sound like there is no DTS-Master Audio track for disc 3.  This is NOT the case.  I don't know what that's all about, but I can confirm that the audio on Disc 3 (Symphonies 5 & 6) is identical to their respective original releases.  There are two audio options for each disc LPCM 2.0 and DTS HD Master Audio 5.1.       Next, the controversial Symphony #2 (on Disc #1) IS THE NEW RE-RELEASE AUDIO VERSION!  If you own the original release, go straight to the 5th movement and play the explosive opening.  You will die when you hear the difference (and you will not be disappointed)!      Finally, Symphony #4.  I had never played my original blu-ray copy of this symphony until making this comparison.  I have read quite a few reviews of this release and most give this disc very high marks for audio.  That being said, some who have purchased the original disc have said that (like Sym. #2) the audio is not a true discrete 5.1 DTS Master-Audio mix but a repurposed stereo mix.  I hear no difference between the audio on the original release and the audio on disc 2 (Symphonies 3 & 4) in this box set.  That being said, the audio on this disc is nowhere near as bad as the original Sym. #2 blu-ray.   It is not in the same league as Symphonies 3 & 6, but not bad at all.  Very natural sounding.  I must admit that I do hear what sounds like some instrument specific panning in things like the sleigh bells and other instruments.  The soprano solo in the forth movement is where I checked the most to listen for any difference in the two releases and I hear none.  What I can't confirm is whether or not this is in fact a discrete 5.1 mix or a stereo mix from which a fake 5.1 remix was created.      The corrected Symphony #2 is known to exist.  I have not heard the same about Sym. #4.  I can find no press release or official info of any kind saying that EuroArts is creating a re-issue of that blu-ray.  Some on this site and blu-ray.com seem to indicate that this very well may be the case.  If anyone else has any official info on the matter, please post.  In any case, the audio on Symphony #4 is not disappointing and I seriously doubt I would have detected any issues, except in comparison to the likes of Symphony #3 which is outstanding!    I would give this new box set a grade of 4.5 stars and gave it the benefit of the doubt with a 5 to balance out the two 3 star reviews.  The performances are uniformly excellent.  The value of getting 7 symphonies on 4 discs amazing (as is the slimmer packaging and single (less flimsy) booklet.  The picture quality varies from very good (Syms. 1, 2 & 4) to excellent (Syms 3, 6 & 7).  Audio quality is demo quality for Symphonies 3 & 6 and very strong on the other releases.  I think people who buy this box will be thrilled with the audio quality on Sym #2, which is no longer the black sheep of the bunch.      Also of note:  some, myself included, had an issue in the 4th movement of Sym #2 with the disc freezing or even locking up their machines.  That issue has been corrected as well.    For those of you who hated the audio mix on Sym #4, you might want to wait for official word from EuroArts on what the real deal is.  I would like to know too.    Hope this helps anyone on the fence on whether or not to purchase (or like me, double-dip) on this purchase.      They had me at Mahler on Blu-Ray!!!  jd

1450400957|5.0|I considered myself extremely lucky when I found out that I was going to have a chance to review \\"The Strength Training Anatomy Workout\\" by Frederic Delavier. Yes, maybe I approached it from a biased point of view, but at the same time, that same bias and high expectation could have left me disappointed if this book had done nothing short of astounding me.    I am not disappointed.    Just the opposite.    I love this book as much, if maybe not more, than the previous companion \\"Strength Training Anatomy.\\" I proudly use and display both books in my health library.    The diagrams are clear and detailed, educational and enlightening. The text is straight-forward and easy to understand. Most of all, the entire package is professional and full of practical and user-friendly knowledge. Each exercise has detailed explanations and diagrams showing exactly which muscles are worked, with examples that take into account real-world limitations and situations. This book also includes workout routines that can be followed precisely, or modified to fit your personal goals and lifestyles.    This book (along with its companion) speaks for itself. You will not regret owning it.
B004QYZATW|2.0|Average at best. Nice cinematography alone does not do the trick. The few action scenes felt like slow motion. If you like to watch Jolie or Depp, this may be something for you. Otherwise, do not waste your time.
B000VDDDY6|2.0|I cannot even tell you how excited I was to finally have bought the remaster edition.  Look at the Amazon listing....it says \\"English Subtitles\\".  Well guess what.....there are none.  It has FRENCH and SPANISH...but NOT ENGLISH.  Someone at CBS or Paramount or whomever actually made this for the ENGLISH speaking AMERICAN market needs to be shot.  And Amazon too, since they incorrectly list this.    I am hearing impaired an need subtitles.  The non- remastered edition has English subtitles-- which I already own. The clarity looks so good on the remaster, but sadly I cannot hear much of the dialogue or read the actor's lips when they are off cam and speaking.  A huge blunder and disservice to hearing impaired / English speaking fans.  This error far exceeds the stupid dual sided disk, where you cannot tell what episode is on each one.    I am sure people without hearing problems will love the remasters......
B004H8GM3K|5.0|After growing up and watching Black Hawk Down multiple times throughout the years, I finally was given a chance into learning more about it. For an English report, I found out I was able to read Black Hawk Down. Before that I never realized it was even a book! From seeing the movie many times, I was expecting the book to be just as good. Fortunately, it was at least ten times better. The book goes into great depth describing all of the soldiers experiences in the bloody battle of Mogadishu. It shows the heroism they had, and even the doubt they had about themselves sometimes, making it more realistic, when a few of the soldiers admit to trying to not go back into the city. From the movie you never realize what many of these soldiers had sacrificed and had lost in becoming elite U.S soldiers. The book almost seems unreal and its just startling to know that these events actually happened. Black Hawk Down gives an amazing insight into how military life actually functions andand military experiences and the ups and downs of it.

1591843790|5.0|Simply put, Enchantment is the modern day equivalent of Dale Carnegie's classic, How To Win Friends and Influence People.  I believe this is a very good thing because we could all use lessons on how to turn on the charm every once in a while.  Carnegie was the forefather of teaching people skills and Kawasaki has picked up the reins.
B0046W1692|1.0|If you are a hardcore Mana fan, like many that have reviewed on this site, you are going to like anything this band puts out.     Hey, why not? It's a reason for a concert tour right? But even if these fans deny it, they will buy those tickets NOT to hear the new stuff, but for the nostalgia of the old stuff, which is worth the price of admission in my opinion, especially since they tour so infrequently.     The fact is, however, that the last good album this band had was Revolucion de Amor, and only because it had 3 or 4 songs that really saved it.     Beyond that, their follow-up, Amar es Combatir, was the beginning of the end, and their decision to put out a cover of a popular Marco Antonio Solis song made many wonder if the creativity spigot was shut off. These efforts offered fans nothing decent and unfortunately, Drama Y Luz has done the same; unless there's a follow-up album in less than a half-decade from now, but given the glacial pace at which this band puts out albums, that is doubtful.     There are no redeeming tracks on this album. Lluvia al Corazon is the only one with any stay power. The rest is pretty bad.     There are bands and artists that venture outside their creative comfort zone and strike gold... Mana is not one of them.     Example?     The track \\"El Dragon,\\" which might possible have been pulled off by another band. But not this one. This track especially was a reach too far beyond their comfort zone, and it missed.     If you're a hardcore fan, you'll buy it because you own all of their stuff. If you are a more passive fan, don't bother. I LOVE this band, I'm at every concert, which is all the more reason I hope more people are honest about their critique of their stuff, see if maybe they put a little more effort into it.     But then again, all greatness comes to an end. It's widely known most of the band members have other ventures. It's clear from this album that most of their time is going to those venture rather than to wow'ing theirfans. But I guess if people would show up to my concerts for the stuff I did before, no matter how bad the stuff I do now is, I wouldn't feel much pressure to be great all over again. Mana is in the shady territory of taking its fans for granted.

0312370849|4.0|I love stories that are set in the WW2 era, and was really excited to read this.  The story is told by 2 people (Sarah and the modern day Julia).  I absolutely loved Sarah's story and I wanted to skip through the Julia sections (I didn't), I found them really tedious and just an obstacle to hear the rest of Sarah's traumatic story!  Sarah's experience during the war was heartbreaking.    I'd recommend this novel just based on Sarah's story but thought Julia's part let the book down.
B00475BUVM|5.0|I bought this movie when we bought our 3D tv last year.  Honestly, it wouldn't have been my first choice of 3D movies, but when we bought it, there were only a handful of movies available in 3D, which were mostly documentaries, and of course we had to buy a few movies to properly try out our new toy. So mostly due to lack of other options, we purchased this one.    I am very pleased to say that what I expected to be a movie filled with too much action (I expected mostly fighting and effects with no real plot) was actually fantastic! It's now one of my favorites, especially as I now have it synced onto my iPod and iPad (thank you digital copy!), so I can watch it any time or place I'd like.    The 3D is incredible! The picture and sound are very realistic (on every version of the movie, even DVD).  I was very impressed.    However, if you are expecting an \\"old time\\" movie theatre 3D, you will not find that here.  The 3D in this movie is not where the images jump off the screen and into your face to scare you (which is probably good, because it would definitely distract from the rest of the movie).  You will not be waiting for something to reach out and grab you, so if that's what you're looking for, you'd be better finding a movie like Despicable Me.  Instead, the 3D is used to improve the quality of the visuals, making you feel as though you are in the room with the characters.  It is very realistic. That way, you become even more engaged with the plot.     Definitely NOT a disappointment
1439102724|3.0|I would like to preface my review by pointing out that I am a huge fan of Jodi Picoult.  I have read all of her novels, and every March make sure I pick up a copy of her latest book.  I love Jodi's style of writing and her ability to create dimensional characters and a story that delves into controversial topics.    It is hard to pinpoint the exact reason, however \\"Sing you Home\\" did not leave me with the same feeling after I closed that final page as the majority of Jodi's other books.  I didn't find myself warming to the characters as I have in her previous books.  I thought the idea and premise behind the book was great, I just was left wanting more and waiting for something exciting to happen.  For me, Jodi's books usually build up to a pivotal point in the novel that introduces a sudden twist at the end.  I guessed the ending to this one about a quarter of the way in and I just felt the book never picked up pace or seemed to gain momentum.    As a stand alone book not comparing to any of Jodi's previous work, it was a good novel, however not one that I would rush to read again.  If you are a fan of Jodi's and love her previous work, then you may be left feeling a little flat and disappointed after reading this novel.  If you're new to Jodi's work, I'd recommend you start with one of her other novels first.
B004NSULHM|1.0|What a load of uninspired noise pollution.These guys really should have given up even before their first album was ever recorded.Take a page from the PORCUPINE TREE art of music making and learn.I can't believe that PT have given these guys the thumbs up.Each cut leads to an even duller listening experience:I suspect they're laughing all the way to the bank while all the chumps line up to buy their crap.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I don't really care how much the Kindle edition, or any other edition for that matter, costs.  I have read all of Connelly's novels and this is one of the absolute finest.  As a lawyer I have to suspend belief during some of the courtroom scenes but the payoff is well worth it.  Connelly knows how to tell a story and he is at the top of his craft in this effort.  Now I can look forward to the next Harry Bosch tale.
0345529057|1.0|I came to buy this book to read on my Kindle. I did not buy due to the Kindle price being double and not discounted at all for the bundle. Double for the Kindle is bad business and I am displeased with this publisher. Hopefully someday I will try again and be able to rate the book content and not the product value.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|Much has been written about this award winning series. I started watching it by accident and was immediately hooked, told my parents about it, and now they are huge fans as well. Bryan Cranston has won two Emmys for his acting in the show and it is totally deserved. Watching Cranston take the character of Walter White and slowly, convincingly transform him from a mild mannered high school teacher to a drug dealer and outlaw is to be in awe of Cranston's remarkable talent.  Aaron Paul, as  Walter's \\"assistant\\" Jesse, is just as good, just as nuanced and complicated,and far more sympathetic.<br /><br />Every character in the series is well crafted and believable and the writing is excellent. Because the story line evolves around illegal drug manufacturing and dealing, there is a fair amount of screen time given to outlaw behavior, including violence. This series is not for the faint of heart or the squeamish-some of the violence is horrific and a startling reminder of just how vicious the underworld of drug trafficing can be. The plots are ingenious, however, and  viewers are constantly asking themselves \\"How are they going to get out of this one??!\\" This is top-notch, edge-of-your-seat TV programming. Watch it if you dare.
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|I'm gonna be short because I'm still reading, but so far, I've gotten a ton of incredibly practical and straightforward mixing tips from this book.      I highly recommend it!!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I just viewed this movie AGAIN, but this time at a local theatre on the big screen, and I was SO impressed with the sheer energy and brilliance of this movie. The dance numbers are amazing and my favorite just has to be the JETS dancing in the parking garage after they find out Biff has been killed. Try not moving your body to that pulsing music!<br /><br />My mother loves to watch this movie at home with us whenever we're home, and she ALWAYS cries at the end. She tells us every time that this was the first movie she ever cried at. It is an astonishingly moving, entertaining, and engaging film, and will NEVER be topped. I know of no other musical with this sort of power. Rent it and watch it with someone who has never seen it, and watch what happens!

B000I3UMLQ|1.0|So there's a lot of very thorough negative reviews of this film so I won't go into detail here.  Bottom line for me is that this is not only THE worst Star Trek movie ever, but it also happens to be one of the worst movies I've seen.  I'd put it up there with Battlefield Earth.  Awful plot.  Horrible direction.  Pathetic special effects.  Characters are completely out of character. Just an abysmal movie no matter how you look at it.  I purchased the entire movie collection on Blu-ray and decided to watch The Final Frontier again (I've only seen it once when it was originally released, and that was enough)just to give it a second chance and to try and remain open minded.  But it really is an awful movie.  What bothers me most is that on the special features Harve Bennett gives a promo speech for the movie sporting a Vulcan hand-sign for \\"I cannot tell a lie\\" and proceeds to tell us that The Final Frontier is \\"Just as good if not better than The Voyage Home\\".  Please.  You're going to Vulcan purgatory for that one, Mr. Bennett.  My least favorite part of the movie is when Kirk is climbing El Capitan and Spock shows up in jet boots.  Wow.  You've got to be kidding.  Then Kirk falls and Spock does a 180 degree spin (showing his boots where his head used to be as if he's Wyle E. Coyote chasing the Roadrunner or something)and zooms down to rescue him before splattering on the rocks below.  The whole scene is cartoon-ish and completely ruins what may have been an interesting subplot of the three of them camping in Yosemite.  Oh well.  On the bright side, I love it when Scotty hits his head on the bulkhead after saying \\"I know this ship like the back of my hand\\".  Or when Sulu attempts to manually land the shuttle on the Enterprise and after Sybok asks him how many times he's done this before he replies, \\"Actually, this is my first attempt\\".  Great acting, great line.  Loved it.  Anyway, I could go on but I won't.  I just wish this movie could be erased from the historicalrecord of Star Trek.  Yuck.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Absolutley fantastic! This is such a great TV Show. It adds something never before seen to the home screen. I've been waiting for a zombie TV show since I was born. This is great. Long live \\"The Walking Dead\\"!!!!!!!!!!!

0439023491|5.0|I am absolutely sure that this was one of the best book series that I have read. The plot line is amazing and Suzanne does an AMAZING job of depicting their lives, struggles, and the environment around them. I cannot speak the praises of this book anymore because it was that good. She wrote in a way that really made me feel close to the characters. I felt as if I was right there with them in the heated action of it all. I found myself becoming one with the book, and never wanting to put it down because it was just that good. The many plot twists kept the book up beat and very interesting. I found myself \\"oo-ing and aww-ing\\" over the events that took place. These books take you away from reality and make you fall into their world of chaos. I'm glad that I was able to travel with Katniss and Peeta through the Seam, fight along side in the Arena, and experience their hardships word for word. Overall, I think that everyone should pick up this series and become immersed in the world of PANEM. Suzanne, you did wonders and I hope another comes my way.
B004SIP7TE|2.0|The first 50 minutes of the movie were great.  The last 50 minutes were great.  The middle??  Absolutely horrific.  I was totally intrigued with the story for the first part, then the middle just went to hell with a focus on leonardo decaprio and cameron diaz.  The last hour was good, but I was still too bored and irritated from seeing the middle to enjoy it!!  Watch the first hour of the movie then skip to the last hour and you'll get the same story without the trash in the middle that gives absolutely nothing to enjoy.

1845761502|5.0|This is a beautifully published hardback book. The paperstock is gorgeous and meant to last a lifetime. Winston has had his hand in so many of the films that I love that this was a no-brainer purchase, and I'm glad Jody Duncan did a worthy tribute to this legend. Tons of high quality images make this a must have for enthusiasts and budding professionals.
B003O86MY8|4.0|David fuses notable, classic rock anthems with classical to create a unique sound in Rock Symphonies.  My only criticism of this offering is that on some songs it seems David's Violin is overshadowed by the other instruments.  But all in all, it is a solid offering from him.  But if you want to experience, the pure mastery and beauty of David's playing, I'd recommend his previous offering, self-titled \\"David Garret.\\"  Rock Symphonies, however, provides an interesting fusion between rock and classical that will allow for a new appreciation for both genres.
0740785508|5.0|I love Gurney's Dinotopia, so I am already pre-disposed to liking this book. Nonetheless, the information, insights, tips, tricks and experience contained in this book is worth the price. I loved looking at the artwork also. Highly recommended for artists and those who've enjoyed Dinotopia.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|I would rate this item a 0 if I could.  Not only did it not sharpen my knife at all, a spyderco endura, it made it duller.  I have no idea if the steel in this blade is too strong for the sharpener, but I had to go back to my kitchen knife sharpener to even put any type of blade back on the knife.  I guess I got what I paid for.
0553386794|5.0|Westeros is a wonderfully crafted realm within A Game Thrones by George R.R. Martin. A Game of Throne takes place around House Stark; a very traditional family who believe that every man should work for the benefit of one's household and kingdom, and the Stark words are Winter is Coming. House Stark is located in the north of Westeros, with Lord Eddard being the head of House Stark, and Lord of their castle, Winterfell. Due to House Stark's position and principles, they were able to elude most of the death and corruption of the realm. Lord Eddard is thoroughly happy with his quaint life but when his close friend and king of Westeros, Robert, asks him to replace his recently assassinated Hand to the King, is when Eddard questions whether his life as Hand will be successful.<br /> The world of Westeros is not full of your standard fantasy affair, such as elves, orcs, and magical staves, but full of villains who succeed heroes that die, and prophecies that don't come true. This book is a different take on fantasy, and provides a biased view of both sides of the conflict. This is accomplished by each chapter being from a view of different central characters; each having their own biased view, and letting the reader decided which side should be worth fighting for. With this type of storytelling, it gives the reader more power in which to decide who is evil or good, or leaning toward one or the other. This also avoids sticking with one character for a long period of time, which could become uninteresting, and allowing for even more suspension at the end of every chapter.<br /> Back to the life of Lord Eddard, Ned has five children, and one bastard. Ned's first son, Robb, is next in line for commanding Winterfell and looks to have the makeup of a strong leader. Sansa is next in line, being the oldest girl, she is very interested in the so called \\"finer\\" things in life and loves to perform needlework, gossip, and drink tea. After Sansa, is Arya, the polar opposite of Sansa and would much rather talk to swordsman and townsfolk than royal ladies. The climber of the family is Bran who is much more at home on the rooftops of Winterfell than actually inside of the castle. The youngest of the family is Rikkon, who is no more than a toddler. The Last member of Ned's \\"family\\" would be his bastard son, Jon Snow, who is almost an outcast, but appears to have a much bigger future elsewhere.<br /> The characters within A Game of Thrones are extremely interesting; with even the lowliest of characters having very human traits. Also the protagonists aren't superhuman and can't figure out every puzzle they're faced with in life, like a protagonists in a Dan Brown book. Even the greatest can fall in this novel whether it's to their death or to a lower state in society.  The characters also seem so humanlike that you could just start a conversation with them and know how they would react to you or your actions.<br /> Due to Ned becoming the new Hand of the King, he has travel far south to the capital of Westeros, Kings Landing. He also brings his two daughters, Sansa and Arya, to try and help them become true ladies, especially Arya. Arya finds a different way to please herself, with sword lessons from a seasoned sword master, and Sansa finds pleasure in gossiping with other highborn ladies. Even with his children happy, things go horribly wrong for Ned and his family, from a family he never thought possible.<br /> This novel is truly an epic, with a branching storyline, centuries of history, and a huge array of diverse and likable characters. It is a truly rewarding read with an ending that begs to be continued. I would highly recommend A Game of Thrones to any fantasy buff or avid reader, for its addicting and thought-provoking story.and would much rather talk to swordsman and townsfolk than royal ladies.

B002PEP4SC|1.0|What a terribly awful book. I really am cofused by all the 5 star ratings. I'm a huge fan of the show, but this book is an embarrassment to the show. The show is well-written with snappy dialogue, well-developed characters, and generally decent plots. This book is a disaster. A decent editor could have probably helped to clean it up a bit, but only a total rewrite by a different (better) author could have fixed it. The characters have absolutely no dimension at all. They are indistinguishable, with the exception of Jameson Rook, who comes off as an arrogant celebrity name-dropping jerk. The \\"romance\\" between Nikki Heat and Rook is barely perceptible (why the author had Nikki Heat compare the tiny flicks of interest between them to a \\"perfume ad\\" is beyond me. Made no sense at all), but then all of a sudden they are rolling around in bed. Huh? One of the reasons I watch the show is because of the slowly developing relationship between Castle and Beckett. It's subtle and wonderful. But I don't think Nikki and Jameson (who are clearly imitating Beckett and Castle) care for anyone but themselves. I also don't appreciate the dialogue from Castle being used in this book. C'mon. I know the book is a marketing ploy, but could we at least be original? Same thing goes for the character of Nikki Heat (her mother was murdered, Kate Beckett's mother was murdered)...I would hope that Richard Castle, were he a real person, would be a better writer than this. I would also hope that he would be more sensitive than to exploit Beckett's trauma for his own gain. There's no reason to read this book. Nothing is good about it. NOTHING. The plot was ridiculous and even though I skimmed it, I knew who the mastermind killer was within the first 20 pages. The paperback itself is of poor quality with tiny tiny print...get out your magnifying glass. Glad I didn't buy it, won't read another, and will pretend the books don't exist. I can enjoy the show just fine without reading them.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|i love the vampire diaries when i first heard they where doing a vampire show based on a book series i went out and bought the books so i would know what to expect before the show aired. as it turns out i didn't need to because the books and the TV show are way different but for the better, i loved the books but the  show surpassed it by a long shot i cant stop watching its addicting. the first couple of episodes were not as good but they improve as the series goes along. the twilight series books were better than the vampire diaries books but the TV show out does the twilight movies to the point i cant watch the twilight movies with the same enjoyment.
B004WKI204|5.0|This book was one of the more enjoyable autobiographies that I have read lately. Tina is self-depreciating, and very humble. I had several laugh-out-loud moments whilst reading this book, particularly with her 'letter responses to fans' and her 'beauty routine'.  Whilst Tina has achieved a lot of success, she makes light of this in her book, and often dwells on the sacrifices and 'trade offs' she has made to get where she is- in other words, she admits that she is not perfect, but is happy with the path she has chosen. I highly recommend this book to any Tina Fey fans. It also completely dispels the myth that female comedians are not funny!!

But that is Disney for you, let's screw everything over for a profit.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I came across this movie a while back, while browsing films. I put it in my Wish List because it sounded interesting, and I usually reference my list when wanting to watch movies online. Anyway, it was on TV and I recorded it. Bored, I figured I'd turn it on. SO happy I did!! The cinematography in and of itself is unbelievable. Everything is so visually delicious! And it's so easy to get swept away in the 'epic tale' as well as the underlying plot of the movie. I highly recommend it... but if you're looking to throw something on in the background, this is not the movie for you. If you aren't sucked in after the first 20 minutes, maybe try another, more mindless film.

1594202842|4.0|Let me make it clear that I am giving this book four stars not because I necessarily agree with Ms. Chua's ideas and parenting style, but because I found this book highly engaging, funny, and moving. I respect Ms. Chua's honesty in portraying herself as a fanatic mom who wants what's best for her girls even to the point of making them unhappy.<br /><br />Amy Chua is a Chinese mother and in Chinese tradition, the children are expected to study hard and be the best at everything---academically and musically. This means lots and lots of practice which leaves little time for the things kids like to do, like sleepovers, playdates, free time,and fun with friends. Anything less than an A is unheard of and music lessons involve several hours of practice per day. Ms. Chua describes an afternoon of piano and violin practices as daily screaming matches and battles of will with her daughters. Usually the threat of losing a prized toy forever kept the girls at their instruments as children; but as they matured, Chua herself admits that her tactics came short of sheer torture. She describes herself as an overachiever who expects nothing less than 110 percent from her girls and does not hold back if something is not up to her standards, i.e. the dreaded birthday card story.<br /><br />Chua ties her daughters' successes with her parenting ability. If her girls got B's or didn't win some sort of competition, than she blamed her own parenting. Chinese belief is that children honor and respect their parents above all else and children must spend their lives making them proud and being grateful for their existence. It is with this mentality that Chua has raised her daughters and, though it worked wonderfully with her eldest, her youngest fought her every step of the way.<br /><br />Long story short, Chua's parenting came to a blow out once Lulu, her younger daughter, got older and downright refused to obey her mother. Lulu hit her rebellious teens and if Chua did not reexamine her relationship with her younger daughter, she would lose Lulu forever. Though much of the fights that Chua describes broke my heart, it is evident that everything this mother did for her daughters came from a loving heart and the desire to watch her daughters succeed. At times it did seem as though Amy was living vicariously through her daughters. She admits that she would have loved music lessons as a child if her parents could have afforded it, so in forcing lessons on her daughters, Chua was giving them the opportunity she never had.<br /><br />Chua justifies her actions as preparing her daughters for the future. She says it is a tough world out there and Western parents are too soft with their children, allowing them to waste precious hours in front of the TV, playing video games. She states that today's young people are not going to be able to compete in the working world because they just aren't bright enough. More importance is placed on athletic successes than academic ones. She sees today's youth as disrespectful and spoiled. For some this is arguable, but I can see where she is coming from. She doesn't want her children to turn out that way.<br /><br />Parenting is the hardest job on earth and children don't come with a \\"How To..\\" book. We each do the best we can and many of us learn our parenting skills from our own parents, the good and the bad. Chua admits that she raised her girls in a very strict way and wonders that some things she could have done differently. Deep down, though, she is proud of that.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Throughout its history, Walt Disney Studios had always been the leader in animated movies.  Beginning in the mid-1990s, however, its partnership with the digital film company Pixar resulted in a whole new world opening up for the studio--namely that of digital animation.  In the ensuing years, audiences both young and old flocked to see the wide variety of films coming from the Disney/Pixar world: TOY STORY; CARS; FINDING NEMO; and RATATOUILLE, just to name four.  Andrew Stanton, the director of FINDING NEMO, however, had a truly ambitious idea for a new animated film, one which would take Disney/Pixar way into a future in which the existence of Earth and humanity itself rest in the hands of an unlikely hero.  That unlikely hero was WALL-E; and his adventure, when it burst onto the screen in the summer of 2008, resulted in an enormous box office windfall for Disney/Pixar totaling close to $600 million.    The titular character of the piece is basically a squat trash compactor, whose name stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth Class.  His job, as has been the case for 700 years, is to clean up the mess that humanity left behind on Earth, compacting various bits of trash into cubes, and whiling away his spare time with a cockroach and a surviving VHS copy of the 1968 film musical HELLO DOLLY.  Wall-E, however, has also gained a sense of conscience and awareness of himself, as can be gauged by his consistently wan expression; and when he sees a small sprout of a plant poking up from underneath an otherwise toxically polluted ground, he senses a change.  He is then visited upon by a female robot called EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), who, upon learning of the existence of the plant in Wall-E's possession, takes both it and Wall-E up to the intergalactic cruise ship Axiom, now in its 700th year of existence, to prove that life on Earth is coming back.    Of course, this is all new to Wall-E, as are some fairly disturbing things, like the non-stop consumption of the passengers (fed to them by the same mega-conglomerate, Buy N Large [BNL] that fatally polluted Earth), and their morbid obesity; and the conflict between the ship's captain and the onboard computer named Auto, whose red eye is so much like HAL in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  With Eve's help, however, and after many wacky misadventures, Wall-E helps the captain retake control of the ship, and steer it back towards Earth once the existence of the little plant becomes fact.  In the meantime, Eve and Wall-E begin an electronic love affair that has been building from that first portentous meeting.    The swath of digital animation films to come from Disney/Pixar has been nothing short of amazing, but they definitely outdid themselves with WALL-E.  Apart from the genuine likeability of Wall-E himself (as engaging a non-human character as any since E.T.), there are numerous homages to films as varied as the 1972 ecological cult classic SILENT RUNNING, George Lucas' low budget 1971 feature debut THX 1138; the Oscar-winning 2006 documentary AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH; Spielberg's A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and MINORITY REPORT; and even Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi/film-noir opus BLADE RUNNER.  And one must also congratulate Stanton for slipping in the homages to \\"2001\\", with the AUTO/HAL connection and the uses of Richard Strauss' \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" and Johann Strauss' \\"The Blue Danube\\", even if most children viewing WALL-E likely haven't seen that 1968 Stanley Kubrick sci-fi masterpiece, at least not yet.    There are also several ironic comments about human consumption and greed, personified by BNL's CEO Shelby Forthright, amusingly played by Fred Willard, and whose rhetoric of \\"stay the course\\" is clearly meant as a broadside against George W. Bush.  The message, however, is never delivered in a heavy-handed fashion; and the focus remains on the relationships that Wall-E develops throughout the film, both with his fellow robots, especially Eve, and with the humans onboard the Axiom; and all of this is aided by Thomas Newman's fantastic and futuristic original score.  The end result in WALL-E is one of the most engaging films, animated or otherwise, in recent decades, and a three-pronged success: a typically successful animated comedy; a science fiction voyage; and a reminder of how we can change our planet for the better while there is still time left to do so.
B000002HPT|5.0|Falling Into Infinity is BY FAR Dream Theater's most underrated album, and certainly one of their best. The fact that it has less than 3.5 stars is absolutely criminal. The sheer amount of ingenuity and variety on this album is unmatched even among other DT albums, much less than that of other bands.<br /><br />Heavy hitters like \\"Lines in the Sand\\" and \\"Just Let Me Breathe\\" are some of their most rocking work to date. \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" and \\"Lines in the Sand\\" is the best one-two punch they've ever created in the studio, and more than enough to give this album a serious nod from any fan who doesn't fall into the pretentious hardcore crowd that says it's \\"too commercial\\" and doesn't judge the album on its many merits. \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" is also probably DT's best instrumental piece out of their entire 20+ year span. Every song, including the softer \\"Peruvian Skies,\\" \\"Take Away My Pain\\" and \\"Anna Lee,\\" have something interesting to offer.<br /><br />Falling Into Infinity is solid and memorable throughout, has some of the best WOW moments of DT's impressive career, and should sit comfortably on the top of the ratings list with Images And Words and Metropolis 2.
B002VPE1OS|5.0|As a relatively new owner, I have come to rely on my iPhone more and more.  I got this product primarily for its screen protection feature, as I clean the face of my phone often to remove fingerprints and smudges.  The anti-glare feature was a secondary bonus that I have come to appreciate only over time ... but as I add more applications on and rely on them in all sorts of light conditions, I need screen clarity.  This is certainly a plus in that regard, and something that I will continue using.
1589944607|5.0|I have been a fan of strategy board games for only a half dozen years now.  A few years ago, a friend turned me onto the idea of the cooperative board game Shadows Over Camelot, which intrigued me at the time.  How hard could it be to beat a board game, with the help of my friends?  Turns out, it can be pretty difficult.    One element of Shadows Over Camelot that I really loved, however, is the traitor mechanic.  While there are strictly cooperative board games, I really enjoy the idea of deceiving my \\"allies,\\" pretending to be helpful, while secretly subverting their efforts for victory.  Alas, over the course of perhaps ten or so games of Shadows Over Camelot, I have never gotten the opportunity to be the traitor.    Enter Battlestar Galactica.  I heard about this game only recently, while experiencing the series for the first time via Netflix.  The deception that can be found in Shadows Over Camelot is more prevalent in Battlestar Galactica.  Rather than there being a chance of a single traitor among up to seven players, Battlestar ensures at least one traitor (Cylons, in keeping with the theme of the show), and indeed can have up to three in a six player game.    Mechanically, there is a lot more opportunity for traitors to do treacherous things, as about one skill check is played per turn, which lets players secretly contribute to either passing or failing the check.    And really, that is what the game is about.  Yes, it is modeled after the recent reboot TV series, but you don't have to watch the show to enjoy the game.  It certainly augments enjoyment, but I have introduced the game to friends who have never watched the series, and it holds up well enough to keep them interested.    The only complaints I have are that the rule book isn't as well written as it needs to be, requiring several online FAQs and errata for clarification, and that the game is pretty long, especially on the first play.  The game is supposed to last between two and three hours (a pretty big time commitment to begin with), but my group's first session lasted more than five hours.  It was a fun five hours, but a lot of the time it's difficult to convince people to play a game knowing that it won't be done for quite a while.    Otherwise, I wholeheartedly recommend this to anybody looking for a game whose central theme is that of deception and treachery.  The rest of the game mechanics are fine, but nothing beats trying to read your friends, or lying to their faces and then laughing about it later.
B004INNRFK|5.0|Having loved his first Hit Man album, ordering this was a definite no-brainer!!   He continues to amaze with the great selection of known artists, including some relatively new on the scene (e.g. Jacki Evantco)!   This sequel is a beautiful addition to the Hit Man concept, and watching the concert completely draws one into the performances.   Any music lover of differing genres will truly enjoy this DVD/CD set!!!

Good journey to you.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This novel offers up a pearl or two, particularly as it begins. As it winds its way through the beats, however, it devolves into a whole lot of talk without much action.

Samantha Stevens meets a reformed LeStat.

How do we get control of the ship?  Why does it slow down when gates are in range?  How does it recharge it batteries?  How do we make things work?  Can we use the stones to communicate? Are you really having the commanders baby?  Mutiny?  Alien attack? Dead people rising?  Just so many threads and so many places to go with the story.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|How can a movie about the founding of Facebook be interesting? The answer is this movie is only secondarily about the founding of Facebook. It is primarily a riveting personal story about the founder of Facebook (Mark Zuckerburg) and his relationship with his only friend Eduardo Saverin, who helped him found the company, and who eventually sues Zuckerburg for pushing him out of the company (Zuckerberg is also sued by three other Harvard students who claim he stole the idea for Facebook from them). The movie focuses on a friendship that is quite tragically broken by ambition, the inexperience of youth, and dog-eat-dog nature of modern financial capitalism. Facebook was created by an antisocial guy who is smart as a whip, has no friends, and is desperate for recognition and acceptance.  The movie definitely portrays Zuckerburg as a selfish jerk, but allows both sides to present their views and lets the audience decide who is at fault. The movie has smart dialogue, brilliant acting (the portrayal of Zuckerburg as an asocial, self-absorbed jerk is brilliant) , and fantastic directing. The film was nominated for 8 Academy Awards including best picture, best directing, and best actor in a leading role. This film is definitely a must see.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|First off, many horror fans do not like this film. This film is atmospheric, artistic and understated even during its most horrific gory scenes. It is not for the viewer who believes \\"Saw\\" is the best thing since sliced bread or for those who don't like to think through their films.    I explain this to others as a film that asks something from you, its not just to entertain you. You have to be able to lose yourself in the plot and see the building suspense and horror through the eyes of a very innocent young woman. You really have to consider what she is seeing and how it appears to her.     The camera work and color are astounding and you really need to be able to take the time to look at the scenery and experience it as almost a character unto itself. The music adds to the suspense and as the tension builds, the music responds.    The film is artistic, moody, brutal, claustrophobic and an experience, not just a movie. Watch it as such. It harkens back to the golden era of film and not to today's movies.
B002G7PWQM|5.0|Thw TV series is fantastic!  Greatest entertainment available recently, along with \\"Camelot\\" and the \\"Borgias\\", but Game of Thrones is my favorite - so many colorful characters and all devising their own plans for success in life.<br /><br />Love the introduction of the direwolf - very beautiful!<br /><br />This is a man who knows how to entertain people through pleasing readers of his books and also by having Game of Thrones introduced to television viewers.  A new treat weekly.<br /><br />Thanks for great fun!<br /><br />  Marilyn in Florida<br /><br />Can't wait to read the paperback set of \\"Game of Thrones\\".  I read every series that comes along that is published; especially if it has to do with medieval times.
0316069353|1.0|it seems to happen to all best seller authors. they write some great books, get a book deal for ten more and then sink into mediocrity writing crap just to cover the contract.    the number of one star reviews tells the story. yes, many complain about the kindle price, a crime in which the author is complicit. but most also mention the paucity of literary talent embarrassingly evident in this latest throw-away title.    at our local library we have put a ban on any future purchases of jonathan kellerman, particia cornwell, james patterson ... and i regret to say now we will have to add connelly.    it is all too easy to continue out of loyalty to buy garbage from once inspiried writers. it is harder to search out upcoming talent, the new writers the publishing industry does not promote
B0002DKCMG|5.0|The movie starts off with Scotty (the protagonist) getting dumped by his girlfriend and humilated in front of his peers. But after that things get much better for him.<br /><br />Scotty goes to Europe to meet a German girl that he's been communicating with for months over the internet. He doesn't get to meet her until the end of the movie, but between here and there, there's tons of stuff that will have you laughing out loud. Some of my favorite parts of the movie:<br /><br />1. The song \\"Scotty doesn't know\\" going viral<br />2. The Pope being declared dead<br />3. News that a new pope has been chosen (just five minutes later)<br />4. The old Pope (still alive) watching live news coverage of the new pope<br />5. Michelle Trachtenberg attempting to hitchhike to Berlin<br />6. Joanna Lumley describing the accomodations at her youth hostel<br />7. Scotty's friend pretending to be a travel guide so that he and his friends can get into the Vatican<br /><br />WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! YOU'LL LAUGH SO HARD, YOU'LL RUPTURE A LUNG!!!

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|purchased this from a private seller on Amazon. It was much, much cheaper than \\"new\\"; however this product was brand new DVD's in original packaging and shrink wrap. Seller was right on top of the purchase, very efficient, and I got the package quickly.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|The Plex devs are an incredible team and continue to amaze me. I've been an avid Plex user for the last few years and in the past year they have come a long way. They seem to innovate day in and day out. I own the plex app for my iPod, iPad, and my HTC Evo. All work flawlessly!     The Android app works better than ever after the most recent update and has also been given a huge face lift. It's gorgeous to look at. Now I use my phone as a full time remote and media browser. It's awesome to be able to control the media center from my phone. A huge thank you to the devs!
B004132HZS|5.0|Saw this on Public Television and loved it; really enjoyed the modern twists, humor and setting and thought the craft and skill that went into this was stellar - great script, casting, acting, directing, music, lighting, camera work, locations - just outstanding all around. Kudos to everyone involved in this; you all did a truly wonderful job.  Best news of all - they've decided to film more of these and I can hardly wait!
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I so wish they made movies like this today, it's a fast paced and fun thriller from beginning to end! The storyline is improbable as all get out but who cares!  It stars one of Hollywood's greatest leading men, Cary Grant, along with James Mason, Eva Marie Saint, Martin Landau, and the delightful Jesse Royce Landis. This movie is so much fun to watch that you can view it over and over again and never tire of it. Each time you'll discover something new to appreciate, and WOW what a musical score by Bernard Herrmann!!! Hitchcock has done \\"The mistaken identity\\" theme many times before, but with this great cast, great writing, great photography and Hitchcock's superb direction (often imitated but never surpassed), it seems as fresh as ever. An essential to any serious film collection and a must for Hitchcock fans....it definitely stands the test of time!  P.S. The Blu-ray transfer is great, and there are documentaries on Grant, the making of the film, and more!
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I have always loved this movie ever since it first came out.  I bought this for my fiance, it is his favorite move, and one of my favorites too.  I recommend this movie to anyone that has always loved the comedy of Michael Keaton.  He is great as Beetlejuice.
B0035IIBNM|5.0|I found this book to be a very stimulating read. It closely examines how many of the things we do are different from the things that we say. It demonstrates how we are strongly ruled by our behaviours rather than our logic.<br /><br />Apart from the human interest aspects of this book I also found it very interesting in a business context. Many of the behaviours illustrates provide deep insight into the purchasing nature of people. It for instance demonstrates how powerful the concept of 'free' is to people's psyche.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and written in a very engaging style. It contains numerous examples and intriguing experiments conducted by the author. If you are interested in understand how the human mind works and how behaviour is dominate over logic in most human experiences then this book is certainly a great read and high recommended.

B004I4H8PO|4.0|Got mine yesterday, sweating out the packaging snafu's. but only 1 disc, the dvd was out & about. All else intact, enjoying the book, probably common knowledge to most but neat for me. I mean, Thorn in a Garden is about a lost dog? 40 years later, that is a cool story.     I agree it is poorly designed & executed. The discs will not be stored back in the tri-fold. Eventually I'll play the vinyl, still have a Jap pressing from 20 years ago so it's not too critical, it was just an added expense. It could have been sold seperately for the completests. The tickets are stupid, remind me of Monopoly money! The button is ok.    I'm more into Layla than Clapton, per se, so the documented reviews that little is new or rare doesn't bother me. This is a bunch of nice stuff in one place. It all sounds great, the 5.1 is fantastic, when the piano coda in Layla came, I was blown away. WOW!    A lot of negative buzz, which about the packaging I can understand. I came out pretty much unscathed.     40 plus years ago I walked into Painters Mill Music Fair, (the 2nd show), had no idea about what I was going to hear. Not a Cream fan at all, only went because of a girl. Iconic show in my life & this whole box brings back a feeling, like great music should.    So audio-wise, to paraphrase Sir Paul in the Anthology about if the White Album should've been 1 disc,    \\"It's Derek's Layla.....shuddup!\\"

0452289963|5.0|I`m going to reread this 'textbook' several times, no doubt about it. I put notes in the back pages to recall specific topics. Don`t we all have poor emotional diets of feeding on our collected negative archetypes?  .... Yes, this fellow knows which side of the bread the butter is on!
B004G600A4|5.0|this is a very cute movie for all. the kids love it and have watched it over and over again.  very good buy got it cheeper than if would have went to walmart.
B000SEI618|3.0|I picked this book because it was an award winner, and while the story was slightly more than fair, the writing was excellent. The descriptions of the sea and the characters drew me in as tho I was actually there. I'd recommend it, but I consider it a \\"lightweight.\\"
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|People who don't believe that this life exists in U.S. are living in ignorance.  Having lived in Oklahoma and Missouri most of my life, when not in the backwoods of Indiana I've known people who have walked this trail.  Hard times make people do hard things, and when people come knocking with the eviction notice the government, welfare, etc. don't help.   I haven't lived it, but I've observed it, some with people I grew up with.  I just don't know how to change it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|So far, of the books I`ve read by comedians this is the best. Silverman, Birbiglia, Oswalt, Cross, Cosby, Carlin,...they have all written some great funny stuff, but this is the kind of thing Tina Fey was born to do, namely comedy writing. This book is funny, touching, smart, sharp and so much more. If you are a fan of comedy you would be doing yourself a great disservice if you missed out on this masterpiece of comedic brilliance. So what are you waiting for? Read this book already!
067003830X|5.0|\\"The Brain That Changes Itself\\" is one of those books that are hard to put down. It's main thesis is that, rather than being \\"fixed\\" or \\"hard wired\\", as was believed by the mainstream medical profession for centuries),  the brain is actually capable of changing its own structure in order to accommodate any particular trauma that may come upon it (stroke, disease, injury etc). Not only does the author put up a good case for his aforementioned thesis, citing some intriguing case studies, but also along the way reveals the incredible attributes of the brain - leaving the reader in absolute awe of that very special apparatus resident within our cranium. A \\"must read\\" methinks.
1907590102|4.0|The Razor's Edge is an unusual Maugham novel. Having read quite of few of Maugham's better and less well-known pieces, I found that this one lacked the psychological urgency that makes them so compulsive. This is meant as a philosophical fable, a speculation on the earthly and the divine. What is a life morally lived? Does it reside in the search for God? Or is it best to cultivate one's garden, to raise children and follow everybody else's worldly pursuits? Should one aim to leave a trace among one's fellow human beings? Or is that mere vanity as well? Such are the questions that this multi-stranded novel explores, criss-crossed with the lives of four fundamentally different characters. Larry Darrell is the young man in search of transcendental truth, having come so close to death as a WWI pilot. His best friend Gray is the stockbroker whose material success is put to the test by the 1929 crash. And Isabel, Larry's fiancée, balances between the two. The fourth protagonist, meanwhile, Elliott, is an older social climber who has made it and whose only interest is in rubbing shoulders with nobility.    Maugham takes his reader through familiar territory, especially Paris and the French Riviera. Yet The Razor's Edge is slow-paced, dragged to contemplative speed by its long polemical dialogues and made more ponderous by its four-stranded plot. Also unusually, Maugham set himself as narrator, and he has a quite active protagonist's part. This gives a modern feel to the book, but it also reduces its immediacy, as if creating an extra, translucent layer by which everything is seen. The Razor's Edge is interesting - I have yet to be disappointed by Maugham - but it is not for novices, to whom I would rather recommend Of Human Bondage or The Moon and Sixpence.
B001P06GX4|5.0|So many games these days are made with no original concept. They piggy-back off the design of other games and call it brand new. Blokus finally gives us a new, fun game that makes you think but is easy enough to learn without getting lost in the rules.<br /><br />Addicting, fun, and easy enough for kids to learn but challenging enough for adults to want to play over and over again. It take about 5 minutes to get the idea of how it's played and your ready to go.<br /><br />Blokus truly is a game worthy of a 5 star rating!
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|Being an audiophile, and generally disliking over-production, echo, compression etc, I can say I LOVE the stripped version MUCH better than the original version.  I also prefer some of the stripped versions found on The Beatles \\"Anthology\\" series and the Lennon Anthology box set.  On Double Fantasy, the stripped versions are more dynamic, have more resolution, and are far more engaging. I am not a Yoko fan, but even her tracks are enjoyable, and the best ones actually pretty darn good.<br /><br />I would like to see the same treatment done to Milk and Honey,,,and well to Mind Games and Walls and Bridges too!<br /><br />So if you are a fan of the Double Fantasy album, get this version, it will open your ears.
B004G6009K|4.0|Daughter and son love this movie. The all in one packaging is great. Blue ray for the house, dvd for the car, digital download for the computer and 3D for the future.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|My daughter was in the high school version of this show and fell in love with the show.  We got this knowing that it was just the music, not the actual play itself and were blown away.  Such talent, very well done.  Nic Jonas was the weakest link but still did ok.  Would strongly recommend.  Again, I wasn't a Les Mis junkie beforehand and loved this video.
B004EI2NM2|1.0|So want my 2 hours back. Actors so skinny they looked like skinned rabbits. Dialogue that just drones on with no purpose but to fill the gaps between over top sex scenes designed for straight males. WTF is with the scene in the bath? Seriously, don't bother

B001FB55HQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I think it was the best one I saw that year.  The story was straight sci fi.  The new vision of the terminator movie has a awesome variety of terminators.  They are done from a motorcycle type to a human skeleton type to a huge space ship type.  The visuals are very dark sort of like the last 2 alien movies were done.  Also I saw the late Stan Winston worked on the movie.  I think he did a lot of special effects in the alien movies.  I think he did the alien queen in aliens.<br /><br />Anyway the special effect are really well done.  I could forget about reality and just watch the screen and go to another place.  That is when the special effects are done well.<br /><br />Also the world was well done and you could tell they spent the money to design many sets and have many location to keep the viewer interested.  I compare the visuals of the world to that of Alien 3 or Alien Resurection.<br /><br />The music is done well and is very emotional.  It was done by Danny Elfman.<br /><br />The acting and story was top notch.  It is a story of sacrifice and redemption.  The two leads Sam Worthington and Christian Bale were exceptional.  Christian Bale is always good at getting you to care for his character.  I think he is an actor that can bring out a lot of emotions for the viewer.  I thought Sam Worthington was very good at this also in this movie.  The woman Moon Bloodgood was good also and believable in her role.  Anton Yelchin was also very good in his role.<br /><br />Also this movie had very mild cussing and the violence and content was not trashy or overdone.  Which I think the last terminators went overboard on this.<br /><br />Recommended to families to watch with children over 13.  I think the parents won't find anything objectionable.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this due to hearing that it wasn't good.  Give it a chance.  I liked it, maybe you will too.<br /><br />Kevin
B00000AFDW|4.0|After one listen through I thought this album was a 3 star album with a few good songs, but after listening a bit more I realized that it is a great album.  Paul Stanley's vocals are amazing on \\"I pledge allegiance to the state of R&R\\" and \\"Dreamin'\\". Gene works his magic on \\"within\\"( In my opinion one of KISS'S best songs ever) and \\"Journey of 1,000 years\\". Space-Ace brings us \\"into the void\\" with a real 70's classic KISS feeling song, and Peter Criss...............well his song is why this album got 4 stars instead of 5(its just them trying to get the same success and magic they got from \\"BETH\\" but it was a failed attempt). Overall this is a great album to bring the original 4 members back together since Dynasty and throughout the album you got a mix of heavy dark songs like \\"within\\" or very catchy songs like \\"you wanted the best\\". I recommend this album for any KISS fan. This is truly one of KISS'S best albums.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|The film was spectacular. I was mesmerized by every scene. One should not be turned off by its subject matter. The film should have garnished academy award nominations for Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger and Linda Cardellini:  And definitely, the film should have won best picture. All I can say is; Watch and be entertained!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a well made bag and for the price I don't think you will find a better one. I really only have two complaints about this bag but they are not big deals. I have a Canon 60D with the grip which makes for a rather tall rig. I wish the bag was about two inches deeper so the zipper would be just above the camera when it is setting in it, if you do not have a grip then it will fit perfect. The other complaint is the way the straps ride my body, not sure why it doesn't feel right when I wear it but it doesn't. It's something with the way the shoulder straps are designed it. Other than those nit-pick'ins I love the bag....I have yet to see anything... especially for the price that can touch it!.. These are just my opinions... your mileage may vary :-)  Here is a list of the items in my bag now.  Canon 60D with the grip.  2 60D Battery chargers  2 Yongnuo Speedlite's YN468  Sekonic L358 Light Meter  Canon 50mm (in a lens bag)  Canon 18-135mm Mounted to the 60D  Tamron 70-300mm SP VC Di (in a lens bag)  3 filters in their original package.  12 NiMH batteries (in containers)  Lens brush  2 Extra lens covers (full set)

B004EPYZQC|5.0|Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster team up again for some more heart pounding adrenaline action. This movie takes place after Fast and Furious. The film brings the crew back together in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil for one last job to get their freedom before disappearing forever. Some of the previous stars through the past Fast and Furious films return, including Tyrese Gibson, (Roman Pearce - 2 Fast 2 Furious) Ludacris (Tej - 2 Fast 2 Furious), Gal Gadot, (Gisele - Fast and Furious) Matt Schulze (Vince -The Fast and Furious) and Sung Kang (Han - Tokyo Drift) all return for one of the most action packed Fast and Furious movies ever. They are faced with a tough federal agent Luke Hobbs (the Rock) who will stop at nothing to hunt them down. I will not give away any more but, I'm happy to say Fast Five does not disappoint. This Movie is action packed from start to finish, and even though it has many over the top moments it is still one heck of an enjoyable action ride. Just like the original film that started it all, this new and final installment will also have you on the edge of your seat. Don't listen to bitter critics, if you like a fun entertaining movie to take you away from your life for a few hours check this movie out!

0307593495|5.0|Mankell's purportedly final book on Wallander offers an excellent coda to the series on the morose but determined detective.  It's a page turner, even with a somewhat too informative plot about submarines off the Swedish coast.  Still, it's a fine portrait of Wallander at 60, facing the demons of aging both physically and emotionally. He' still dealing with his irascible daughter Linda (and where did those genes come from?) and his conflicted feelings about his ex Mona. Mankell remains a master at weaving the crime plot into Wallander's angst-ridden life--and even a little humor along the way.
1588167461|4.0|A \\"Man's Guide to Looking Good\\" is not the first book I have read on the subject but is one of the better ones. Most men could use a little help with dressing themselves and deciding what to wear and when. A lot of guys won't read this stuff as they depend on girlfriend, wife or even mom to tell them what to wear. I have a young friend who went to CA for a few months and worked in a men's shop. Now he thinks that CA has the answers. He wears his dress pants too short and pegs the legs. Looks silly but works well when it rains.  This is a good read. try it even if you've been to CA!
0553381695|5.0|I finished \\"A clash of kings\\" and I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. I heard some people to complain about how long and confusing those series are. I disagree- I am not native English speaker but I read first two books in English and I understood them pretty well. Those books are huge but actually the language is quite easy and this is definitely a fast to read book.   The main disadvantage of \\"Clash of Kings\\" is probably that it is a sequel. The GOT, the first one, was a great story- if you start you will never put this book down: lots of suspicion, great characters, interesting, smart, twisted plot. What else do you need for a great fantasy book? If \\"A clash of kings\\" was a totally new story with new characters, it would be probably easier to build something great again. But this book is a sequel. And Martin took a great challenge. That is to make this book at least not worse than the first one, which was, as I think, one of the best fantasies stories ever written. I have to say, he managed this task pretty well.      As any good sequel, you will meet some new characters. Old ones will be still the same. The style of the book pretty much follows the style of the first one which is both bad and good. Bad- because you probably expect something new and different from the sequel. Good- because Martin's writing skills are pretty darned good in this style. He still makes you get attached to those characters and make them feel sorry for them. He plays with you by putting those characters on the edge between life and death; and you just can't help yourself except for keeping reading to find out what will happen with them. While some characters will survive, others won't be so lucky.... Those series are that kind of books where people can and do die. That is probably the strongest part because in this case pretty much everything can happen.     In the sequel, there is also more magic. Not fancy, Harry Potter style but dark and dangerous one. I think that made the book even better and a bit creepier.   Despite the fact that the story grabs you and never let go, there are still some disadvantages. The main one is talking. Especially in the first half, the characters constantly talk, plan but never do too much stuffs. When I read first 250 pages I suddenly found out that, except for Arya, nothing too important happened yet and that made me sad. Talking, talking, not much action and that can make you bored. On the other hand, if there was no so much talking, Martin's books probably never would be so great and unique. You get attached with the characters, they do lots of stupid stuffs but you would never understand their motives without this long prologue (about the first half of the book) where everything is described without so much of action. Martin's style makes his books alive.   The closer it is to the end, the more stuffs happen. The last 200 pages, I would say, perfect. I couldn't go to sleep- just kept reading.     As I said, the biggest disadvantage is that it is a sequel. Look, for example, on Harry Potter books. All seven ones hold one storyline but each book is also a separate story with the beginning and the end. In \\"The song of Ice and Fire\\", it is one big plot divided in several books. That can be quite tricky sometimes. It is like reading half of the book, then quit and then continue reading it but only from the half of the book again. The book never seems complete. You want more but when you get it by starting reading the next one, you need some time to get used to the characters and the plot again. It is not like getting familiar with the new story like in Harry Potter- it is reading the same story from the last book. In other word, those books have neither beginning nor end and that can be quite annoying sometimes. It is the same way with Lord of the rings- one story and three books. However, nowadays you have all three books available in the store. You just read it as one story and you don't need to wait six years for a continue to come out. That is what makes the whole series a bit confusing- starting with a clash of kings and further, books never have beginning or the end.     Anyways, it is still a great story. I don't regret that I started it.  A Clash of Kings is a bit worse than The Game of thrones but it still holds you tight and everything you can do is to beg for more.
B004XWLN20|3.0|I've been converting my movie collection to blu-ray as much as possible, and one thing I would love to see is a complete box set of Smallville on blu-ray added to that collection. In this day and age, I have no idea why there is no blu-ray offering for a show of this magnitude and fanbase. This is the time for a definitive collection, and that requires the highest possible quality, which cannot be delivered with the DVD format. When a blu-ray is announced, I will be sold. Until then, I'll stick with the DVD seasons I have for now.

B0041KKYDI|3.0|This movie is just so-so. Franco's acting seems flat given what his character endures - I'm pretty sure I've expressed more pain and aggravation after stubbing my toe.  And Boyl's use of split screens, flashbacks, and a  jarring, self- conscious soundtrack never let me feel like I was really there.  In 130 minute film with little plot, really identifying with the character and losing yourself in his situation is what it's all about. Otherwise, a couple of hours is a long time to stare at some guy trapped by a boulder.      For real life, edge-of-your-seat thrills in the wilderness, I suggest \\"Touching the Void,\\" which is engrossing - and often exhilarating - from start to finish.
B004FOA84A|4.0|was a fun game but its short and begs more.   couldnt turn sound off or lower volume despite using control in options, but i trust the dev to fix this.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I have owned these headphones for a few months and they continue to work magnificently.  These are a great value for someone who wants great sounding speakers in a comfortable headset that does a good job of canceling out outside noise.  You really have to tap me on the shoulder when I have these on to get my attention. Also these are a great fit for those of you who may have a larger noggin.
B000ANVQ0K|3.0|I want to start off by saying how I was emotionally affected.  I have not seen Titanic in close to 15 years, when I saw it for the first time since I was maybe 13, an hour and a half into the movie I became overwhelmed with emotion.  One, I forgot how much I got attached to Jack & Rose and even Cal too.  The actors did such an amazing fantastic job, this movie is why I originally wanted to study film and theatre.  Not only do I get emotionally attached to the characters, but the fact that I did my research after this film came out, that ultimately, I was not able to finish watching the second dvd.  With that said, I have a review #2 and it goes like this:<br /><br />As much as I love love love this movie, I was a bit disappointed when I saw the \\"pods\\" on the Special Features parts- they all are only at least 30 seconds long each.  I know the movie made more money so that they can afford to have hours and hours, minutes and minutes left of behind the scenes, rehearsals, more extras, interviews with Leo, Kate and Billy.  There really could have been a lot more in this Collector's Edition and I'm hoping perhaps for a 20 year edition, there is more to it.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|It was beyond words, truly beyond words.  Musicians will tell you that on rare occasions during live performances, they no longer feel like they are playing the music - instead the music simply flows through them on its own power, effortlessly.  This entire concert was breathtaking, but at a certain point during McCartney's performance of All Things Must Pass, you can feel that something mystical, something transcendental, is happening. From that point through the end of the concert, the music just flows. You can hear the transcendence, see it in the musicians' faces, feel it - absolutely feel it.     I had to fight back tears throughout the concert, but when the transcendence occurred, I simply let my tears flow along with the music, effortlessly.  I never met them, yet I grew up with them.  More than the others, George was like a brother to me.  All our lives are richer for their being a part of it.
B004FOA84A|4.0|The game is quite fun, puzzles are good and atmosphere is nice, although the resolution isn't maybe as developed as one might like. Highly recommend, hope the developer releases more!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|First let me say I LOVE Jane Eyre!!! I have read the book and have seen every film version I've been able to lay my hands on. This is my absolute favorite version. I love that it is 4 hours long, so the viewer has a chance to understand who Jane is her angst, her grace and to see her relationship with Mr. Rochester develop. I think the pairing of the two actors who play the H/H is pure genius, my 14 year old daughter sat through the entire 4 hours glued to the screen!
B004E547D8|1.0|The film is a classic Brucie with lots of tongue in cheek jokes and basically a whole lot of blowing stuff up, however dont waste your money if you want the HD sound as this is only Dolby 5.1 -for me a big disappointment. The picture was pretty jerky also, great when it was steady but oh dear when it was not steady very distracting. Why sell a bluray without the better HD sound?  BUYER BEWARE of this version and just go straight for the special edition.
B004G600A4|4.0|For those of you who haven't seen Tangled yet, it Is a must-have Film, and destined to be a true Disney classic.  My only problem with the DVD is the lack of special features.  The only features on the disc other than the movie itself, is an alternate penciled intro.  All of the other bonus features such as the behind the scenes and such is on the Blu-ray.  So beware.
B000001DQI|5.0|This is classic Elton John with his mix of soft mellow tunes and fast peppy ones.  Most the songs on this CD are recognizable as hits so it is very easy to listen too.  I would recommend this CD to connoisseurs of both rock and easy listening leanings.
0300169787|5.0|This is an INCREDIBLE book.  I love the transforming cover!  Based on the upcoming exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the book includes statuesque models painted white like mannequins adorned in Mcqeen's designs.  Many of them are headless (obviously done in post production), some are faceless (also post production) - I think this anonymity adds to the power of his works.  I have to say, I was delighted I had ordered my copy in advance when I found out the newly wed Duchess Kate Middleton had decided to have her dress designed by Alexander McQueen's house!!!  Between the upcoming opening and how stunning Kate's dress was this book is sure to be a sell out!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am used to finding second books disappointing in Trilogies, however this one kept my interest, I read it in a day. I loved that it wasn't predictable. Good book!
B00081U7HC|1.0|Perhaps, it's not at all fair that I review this movie, so forgive me.  It's the only negative review I've posted, and it's not something in which I'd have the slightest interest, and I don't care for Julia Roberts.  I was 'roped' into watching this film on cable with a friend several years ago.  Within several minutes, I could accurately guess the shallow plot which could be summed up as: ignoramous/tramp with a phoney Jersey(?) accent moves to Hollywood and meets pimp (Richard Gere.)  Big surprise--they hit it off.  Big surprise--he has feelings for her but she doesn't.  Big surprise--she changes her mind and wants him.  Big surprise--she changes her mind again and doesn't want him.  Huge surprise--she changes her mind again and off they go into the proverbial sunset.  Hopefully, Gere sent her to school to learn to read and write, at least, though that's irrelevant in her \\"profession.\\"<br /><br />I had to get away from this thing more and more as it went on, by taking an unprecedented amount of smoke breaks outside (and just sitting outside for awhile, for that matter.)  By the time of one of the sex scenes--I think on top of a piano--he removes her little slip the size of a handkerchief.  That was it.  I stayed outside until it was over.<br /><br />But I did learn one thing.  The next time someone ropes me into something I dread, I'm gonna say \\"Gee whiz, guess what?  I just saw it on TV or VHS or DVD last week.\\"  That will get me off the hook and out of this kind of situation again.  I guess I could have been blunt and told my friend a minute into the film that I couldn't withstand it.<br /><br />I'm not trying to be mean, but this kind of junk just doesn't do a thing for me--give me some quality films from the 50s & 60s (see my relatively few reviews.)  Hope no one takes offense.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not my usual type of read, yet once I started this book, I got into it and became wrapped up in the storyline, loved the characters, and couldn't stop reading until I got through the book! I also appreciate the fact that such a popular book is fairly priced.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Having recently seen the first three movies in the series (which I will review here, albeit conjoined with the fourth one), I was pleasantly surprised by each film (as I'm not a fan of cars, and don't get an adrenaline rush from engines, etc) as each one boasts concrete storylines, terrific acting and smart & stylish script-writing, not to mention rock-solid directing. In each movie, there is a story that draws you in and makes you care about the characters. The first movie and the third connect very well with this one, as the characters are developed further and emotional impact is added. My least favourite in the series in \\"2Fast2Furious,\\" but I recommend all of them. The films are rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.
0061148512|3.0|The Bell Jar is a beautiful example of a classic, modern piece literature. The language is exquisite and the journey through the mind of Esther is completely engulfing. Sylvia Plath, in both her prose and poetry shows great insight into the human mind and demonstrates her true knowledge of the unstable person's mentality and recovery. The Bell Jar, like any great novel, questions and challenges the fabric of society and life itself.     However, The Bell Jar can make even the most mentally stable person feel depressed and slightly suicidal. The entire novel deals with suicide: the road to Esther's breakdown, her week of attempting suicide and her years of recovery. When reading any work by Sylvia Plath, such as The Bell Jar or the poem Lady Lazarus, one must remember that Plath herself did end her life in suicide. For those with unstable tendencies or pessimistic views on life, The Bell Jar will only hinder growth and happiness.    I will not be one to discourage people from reading the beautifully crafted novel that The Bell Jar is. My only recommendation is to choose a bright, happy day to undertake this novel as it will completely change your mentality, at least for the time in which you read it. Watch a happy movie, spend time with loved ones or read your favorite children's book (The Frog Princess) to restore your will to live after reading this novel. Until then, enjoy the disturbing masterpiece that Plath has created.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I'm zombie obsessed! Love the show cant wait till the next season! I keep wondering when its going to come back.
B0032W5H9C|4.0|I'm Carey Mulligan's newest fan.    Everybody said what needed to be said in the other reviews.  I just wanted to say that it's interesting that when David was dressed up, he was the picture of attractiveness.  He seemed so kind and smooth and charming.  Yet in the confines of the bedroom, in private, at the height of his creepiness, his kindness and charm gives way to this creepy, pedophiliac desperation.    I loved how the movie was able to show that.    I wish the movie was able to answer the question for why we need an education more clearly though....without Jenny having to literally spell it out for us in a few pat sentences.    Loved her and her father at the end, especially.      The movie is unapologetic but forgiving.
0061537969|5.0|We love our pets so much, and they are family.  So we need to be kinder to their feelings, than ours. They shouldn't suffer because of our inability to make good decisions for them.
0471267554|4.0|If you want results, then you have to be willing to scarifice. Grains are indeed bad for you. Sorry. Its the truth no matter how hard it is to hear. Try other lifestyles and see how far they get you. Then try the paleo lifestyle and compare the results. Make excuses if you will, but if you want to live longer and healthier lives, then stop complaining and making excuses. The book had a lot of heavy material to wade through. You can do it. And Rob says it best when he says that you dont have to understand why it works, just that it does work.
B000XVSU9O|5.0|I read this book in one day. It was an quick read and easy to follow. I found the author told the story as if you were her friend and this was her life story. It was very comforting. Her detailed  accounts of heaven to me were believeable. I've shared this book with a few of my friends and they in turn bought it for their friends. It made me think alot about the after life. I've reread it three or four times over the years.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|The Social Network, 2010 film<br /><br />A young man brags about a 1600 SAT score to a young woman. [Does this conversation seem funny?] What is the best club (or clique) to join? A lesson in behavior and manners? Is he a \\"nerd\\"? We see scenes at night (to avoid a crowd?). Harvard 2002. Mark posts messages to a Bulletin Board to vent his frustrations. He searches the databases that contain pictures of people to gather them into one location. A harmless pastime? [Appropriating other's work or an invasion of privacy?] The activity takes advantage of a human flaw: the need for attention. The high traffic causes a network crash (too many users for a limited space). Does Mark have a sense of humor? Two brothers, wealthy heirs who row crew, want to talk with him. They have an idea for a web site. [The film begins to switch scenes, disturbing the flow of the story.] The idea of a web site where people could advertise to access their friends seems appealing.<br /><br />Did Mark Zuckerberg do the work he agreed to do? Was he paid? A conversation leads Mark to a new feature about a person's interests. The \\"Facebook\\" site grabs a lot of attention. It makes Mark famous on campus. When can they monetize this site? Mark didn't use anyone's code. [But it's the idea that counts.] Mark seems arrogant and insulting to the opposing counsel. Erica tells him \\"good luck with your video game\\"! They will expand to cover other colleges. [No permission?] Does Mark violate Harvard's Law? Entrepreneur or unemployed? [Was President Lawrence Summers really like that? A stuffed shirt? Was he later forced to resign?] Mark and Eduardo went to New York to visits an investor, and Shaun Parker. Shaun warned them about what happened to him. [Would anyone hire a private investigator to learn about him?] Could someone plant an article to embarrass Eduardo for a commercial advantage? [Sure, watch the news.]<br /><br />There is a contest in hacking computer systems. The winners are hired for Facebook. We hear a story about the invention of \\"Victoria's Secret\\". A parable? The Winklevoss twins are in the Thames Regatta. \\"Do you have `Facebook' in America?\\" They will sue in Federal Court. Eduardo flies from New York to learn what's happening behind his back. As CFO he controls the money. Mark finds investors in San Francisco. Peter Thiel invested $500,000 in the company. \\"We did it!\\" Was Eduardo cheated in this deal? With the new investors the original owner's shares were \\"diluted\\". [Was this a swindle?] We see the characters of Shaun and Mark. They now have One Million members. But uninvited guests show up at the party. \\"What happened to Shaun?\\" Mark's lawyer advises him to settle, its like a speeding ticket. And just what is Erica doing? [A nice ironic ending.]<br /><br />The Winklevoss twins received $65 million in their settlement (for their idea). Eduardo Saverin received a settlement and his name was restored to the Facebook masthead. Facebook has 500 million members in 207 countries. The shares are currently valued at $25 billion. Is it recession and inflation proof? [It is now a prime source for private investigators.] Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in the world. [What percentage does he own?] Who could have imagined they could create a successful movie about an internet start-up company and its legal problems. This story has a lot of drama from its personal conflicts. Is it a warning about Wall Street and the venture capitalists who buy low and sell high? It is surprising that a young man could outsmart those who are older and more experienced. Not much was said about Mark's prior background. I wonder how much of this story is true? Were the twins played by one actor?<br /><br />Edmund Land dropped out of college to work on his instant camera. Bill Gates dropped out to work on minicomputers. What would have happened if they waited to graduate?
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This is an excellent movie, describes love beyond the walls of marriage, it's funny and full of surprises. [[ASIN:B0001CNRBG Same Time, Next Year]]
0756404738|1.0|Given the quality of the Name of the Wind, Wise Man's Fear is a pretty shocking disappointment.  It is closer to a random collection of short stories centered around one character than an actual novel.  I had trouble finishing the book and won't be waiting around for book 3.
B003DTLUFO|4.0|we love, love , love the toy.  it wasn't the one in the photo, but the seller explained that the photo was scanned wrong.  the seller made good to rectify the situation, and we WILL buy from them gain
B003ZTQN1I|1.0|i was so incredibly disappointed that other people sing these songs on the cd. the movie makes these songs great. i rushed to the store three minutes before they closed to get this cd after renting the movie. ripped it out of its plastic and eagerly scanned the disc to hear the stars sing the songs. and they weren't there. i dont want to hear faith hill sing the song (alone) that's in the movie as a duet. (heck i dont want to hear her sing at all. i had never purchased any of her music because it doesnt effect me.) i want to hear the guy sing the songs he sings. i want to hear summer girl on here. i got nothing i wanted, except gwyneth paltrow singing a couple tunes. if i could find a true soundtrack i would buy it! dont waste your money buying this if you want the songs to sound like they did in the movie.
B000002I53|5.0|The album is awesome!  It's another classic that shows Coltrane and his ensemble at their best.  I was pleasantly surprised with the 4-song album that is definitely a jazz classic!  If you love Coltrane, you should love one of his best works!
0375507256|3.0|read this book based on a mention in another book review in the New Yorker.   the reviewer mentioned mitchell's fabulous way with verbiage.  i didn't find that, much preferring t.c. boyle's fabulous word-spinning.  the novel's spanning of eras was interesting although i missed the links between them except for a clone-slave later (centuries later) turning up as a god to the unfortunate humanoids of the time.
B004SBX112|5.0|This game is awesome!  If you like Angry Birds you'll like Seasons too!  It's the same excellent game with fun themes (new levels) for a bunch of holidays and the keep adding more!  It runs perfectly on my Droid X with stock 2.2.1 non-rooted.  I highly recommend this game!
B004UID2LC|5.0|works well on HTC incredible with froyo on VZW .. try it .. jetvd stopped working for me so this was a nice find
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've tried a bunch of calendar apps because I can't stand the stock one on my Droid X and wow! Everything about it is intuitive and easy to learn even though there's a ton of features. Multiple sizes of widgets that are almost fully customizable with short cut keys, colors, etc. I got it as the free app of the day but its definitely worth paying for because nothing compares.
0061537969|5.0|I saw this book a few years ago and bought it because of the cover. I have rarely loved a book as much as this one. Its kind and gentle and loving and the story is told by a dog. Words fail me in describing this book, if you loved Marley and Me you will love this book too.
0439023521|5.0|I am a huge fan of dystopian literature and I was initially skeptical of a YA novel attempting this genre.  Will the author be willing to be honest and brutal?  With the main character be strong enough?  Will there be a believable love interest?  YES YES YES.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is the reason I am now reading YA literature.  I grew up on Suzanne Collin's work, I was an avid watcher of \\"Clarissa Explains it All,\\" so it is to no surprise that I am utterly obsessed with her series.  Katniss is strong wiilled, loyal and brave.  She is everything I want to be.  I am fascinated by this society, with its Survivor/Arena game and militant government.  I could not put this book down.<br /><br />If you haven't read this series yet, what are you waiting for?
B004TTMYQG|5.0|what a great calendar. can't believe I got it for free. was suffering with pocket informant for too long. now have switched to this. just wish u could set option to &quot;snap to grid&quot; when scrolling horizontally. hopefully some updates will resolve _he few quirks.
B004XWLN20|3.0|I already own the first 9 reasons on DVD, and will get the 10th.  Unless the full collection is released on Blu-Ray, there's no reason for me - and, I suspect, many other Smallville fans - to spend money for this.  Give me a full set of Blu-Ray, and I'll gladly spend the money.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Okay, after I purchased my first DVD of Avatar I got hooked.  When I bought it, I had no idea of what the movie/Cameron's film was really about.  So, when I read there were an additional 16 minutes (or so) of scenes not in the original, I had to have it.  Now, it is my number one favorite - of my personal collection of over 1,000 movies.  The extended cut version is the \\"whole\\" Avatar movie.  The extended cut scenes tie everything together!   Right from the start, Jake Sulley is shown rolling across a crowded intersection in an overpopulated, futuristic city where most everyone wears a mask over their face to keep out...something, bad-smell, bad-air, who knows.  Probably a combination of both.  It explains Jakes prayer to Eywa \\"there is no more green on earth.\\"  It then shows Jake in a cramp apartment, smaller than the standard apartment for a North Korean citizen.  And, on the tele, a commentator talks of a Chinese Zoo bringing long dead species of animals back to life like the Bengal Tiger.  On their first science sortie, Jake, Dr. Augustine, and Norm stop at Dr. Augustine's old-school to grab some supplies.  It is there that Jake asks Dr. Augustine, \\"what happened here\\" after seeing bullet holes in a wall.  Another comment made by Dr. Augustine is how the Navi learned English faster than she could teach it, and that the Navi learned \\"all they needed to know about humans\\" in a very short time.  Oh, and on the ride in to there first field assignment, they pass over a heard of Sturmbeasts, whose counterparts are the American Bison.  Later in the extended cut, a whole hunt-scene of the Sturmbeasts takes place where Jake and Tsuetsey (sic) both score kills on Sturmbeasts while flying Ikran!  The arrow shots must hit the beasts in there left air-intake ventricle to take them down as evidenced by horse-mounted Navi's spear throws merely glancing of the ultra thick hides of the Sturmbeasts.  The most important part however is the scene with Jake and Dr. Augustine where she tells him the story of Nateri's sister who is executed by RDA security forces at Dr. Augustine's school after setting a bulldozer alight.  This occurs right in front of Nateri.   There is a lot more in the extended cut than I have mentioned here, but like I said, it ties everything together, especially the ending, where Tsuetsey dies (more than just falling out of the back of the shuttle) and makes Jake... It's awesome!  There is also several hours of special features where you can watch scenes in various stages of production that never made it into the film. My favorite is the confrontation where Quatterich grabs administrator Selfridge by the neck, lifts him off the ground and says \\" you're a long way from home.\\"  The box (three leaf book type) is very nicely done in glossy pictures with comments.  Bottom line, if you are an Avatar fan, this is a must have DVD set.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|The movie is well made.  The movie is made on the slowest part of the books so it was hard to make fun to watch.  The special features are okay nothing that amazing though.  The sceen from the next movie is not that great and maybe 2 min if that.  Still love the show just not that great special features.
0312330537|4.0|Shantaram was suggested by a close friend of mine , having heard so much about the book and also  being from south Mumbai I couldn't resist picking up this big book.   but believe me  once u start reading the story it is so captivating ,U  don't feel like putting the book down. The story plot pretty much  revolves in  and around Mumbai with intricate descriptions of the characters so much so that u feel u r living the story. The best part was the author had  added some real life characters too, easy to pick out if u were well versed with Mumbai . Very beautifully done ! This is a keeper.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|This CD brings back great memories but it's sad at the same time.  This was recorded at the end of the Beatles' career and it's sad to know that John and George are gone but they live on in this excellent CD.  I appreciate their music more now than I did when I was younger.
159448385X|4.0|This is an excellent read .... goes beyond expectations.   Having already read The Kite Runner this second book by Khaled. H  just sealed the deal.  A beautiful love story in the backdrop of Afghanistan, also an eye opener for most people on so many levels.
B00000F6LQ|3.0|Please be very careful if you order this edition of the classic Monty Python comedy.  As I have just learned the hardest way possible, the center pegs in the case require a lot of care and patience when inserting or removing a disc.  Too much force will cause the disc to bend and break.<br /><br />The center pegs are made of a hard plastic that's all one piece, therefore making it almost impossible to remove the discs without risking breaking it.  As much as I love this movie, I have to give this set 3 stars just because the way the case was made caused me to accidentally ruin the bonus disc, which I was very excited to watch.<br /><br />Oh well.  At least I got the screenplay out of it.  Once again, this review has nothing to do with the movie.  I LOVE the movie.  I just hate the way they made this case.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|Ok, I've bought all the reissues and the records so I know a little of the history of the SOUND of Robert J.   This reissue got all the hooks right. The remastering, compared even to the 90 re-re cd issue literally BLOWS  it away for listenability. This, finally is the holy grail of RJ. It is finally, a collection you can listen to without being  totally stoned and enjoy!! Kudo's to the Columbia label for FINALLY gettin it right!!  Gerard Masters
0425220931|5.0|This was probably the best book I've ever read. Victor Wooten has a singular way of describing the lesser noticed aspects of music. His use of a pseudo-fictional story to illustrate the important lessons that you yourself can use somehow drives home these concepts further and makes them more personal. I recommend this book to every single person I know who plays or is even just interested in music. Get it, you won't regret it.
B004OKFISQ|3.0|The Pressing though, bites! Lotsa pops and clicks and it's NOT an Audiophile 180g Pressing. But this Steve Hoffman remaster is very Clear and a good listen. If you like your sound a bit 'Forward' then this should fit the bill very nicely!   On the other hand the EU 45RPM 'Non SH' mastered pressing has been clubbed to death as a bad sounding effort. I have Both, and I will say that   the EU pressing is just Amazing with it's fluidity....  The sheer sonic beauty and quietness of the pressing is exemplary! We Still don't know who the Remastering Engineer on this particular edition is, but it Sucks you IN! Those who have blindly sent back their EU copies without EVEN LISTENING TO IT should be ashamed of their closed mindedness!  Do you like Red Wine or White??? That's about what it comes down to, but both the US SH mastered AND the EU mastered editions are BOTH great listening. But that's just my opinion, and like a**holes, everyones got one!  Gerard Masters    Oh, one other thing, I just go two EU Backup copies today.....That should speak for itself.  Cheers.  Gerard Masters
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I was using a Zalman before this, I tried the Corsair H70 but it wasn't cooling as well as the $30 Zalman. I decided to buy this because of all the great reviews. This thing is awesome, especially for the price. I am overclocking my i5-2500k for 4.5ghz at 1.295v and while running prime this thing is keeping my temps below 60 degrees Celsius, about 10 degrees cooler than my last air cooler. I just wish the provided the specs on the included fan so that I could get a matching fan for the other side.  The one I ended up getting doesn't push as much air.
B004GHNHVW|3.0|Here's the scoop.  Technically, this album sounds as good as anything Paul Simon has done.  His lyrics, as always, are some of the best American poetry you'll find set to music.  But if you're looking for the kind of melodies he did back in the sixties, seventies, or even as late as \\"Rhythm of the Saints,\\" you're going to be sadly disappointed.  The songs are without strong melody, hooks, or basic chord structure they'd teach at Berklee or other places where they teach how to create modern music.  And if he'd been anyone other than who he is, this album would have been tossed in the reject bin by any major record label out there.  But you cannot say this is just the same old stuff rehashed over again.  All I can say is I cannot wait to see where he goes with all of this.  Worth at least a listen, and again, if you can adjust to lack of melody...this is a gem.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great mystery puzzle game in the style of Myst. Not as difficult though. My only complaint is that it was to short. But it was fun.

0848833031|5.0|Wish to Hek Reviews: Darkly Dreaming Dexter       I know this review is coming out seven years late but I've been busy.       Jeff Lindsay has crafted such an amazing character in the first installment of this series as Dexter invites us into not only his story, but into his head as well.  Told in first person, Darkly Dreaming Dexter, tells the tale of a blood splatter analyzer who is thrust into a cat and mouse game involving a serial killer who has a fondness for cutting up hookers in Miami.       Whatever, right?       The difference here is that Dexter is a wannabe serial killer himself.  We really get to see his thought processes and the neurosis within him as he is torn between envying the work of this serial killer or actually, you know, trying to catch him.  Dexter is also worried that it is actually his Dark Passenger (his killer instincts) taking over Dexter's body and making him do the killings in his sleep.        Most of us, I hope, wouldn't have to worry about cutting up a bunch of hookers in our sleep but Dexter has to.  Without giving away too much about the story, Dexter is a killer but he tries to only kill the bad people, and I mean the really bad people.  Killing a bunch of hookers isn't what Dexter is about but after a trail of clues and visions of the killings leads the crazed blood splatter analyzer to believe that maybe he is the guilty party.       Who is the killer?  Is it Dexter's sister, Deborah or maybe the hot-for-Dexter detective LaGuerta?  Or maybe Dexter himself?  Those of you who have seen the show may already know the answer to this so don't give it away.  I've never seen the show but am intrigued by the character of Dexter so I will have to check it out after reading a couple more of the books.       At its core, Darkly Dreaming Dexter is a humorous and disturbing book with a lot going for it  Highly recommended.  My wish this time?  I wish that one day Hek gets a chance to grant one of Dexter's wishes.  That would be fun!!!Robert Ford knows a lot about wishes as he is the author of the wishes with an evil twist series, The World of Hek.

B000UR9QGW|4.0|What points this loses in coherence and structure it immediately makes right back with energy, ingenuity and downright entertainment value. Little more than a one man show, Evil Dead 2 is where Bruce Campbell really made his name, and deservedly so. Whether he's shrieking like a little girl at the sight of a poorly-animated headless marionette, cackling deviously as he nails down his own evil right hand or playing it cool as the gritty, badass soldier-man with a chainsaw appendage, Campbell boldly plants his flag right in the center of every scene. I can't begin to imagine the kind of fun he and director Sam Raimi must have had cooking up one outlandish, unbelievable situation after the other, then playing it up on-screen to this degree. It's a film you'll never quite nail down - is it meant to be serious or slapstick - and that's precisely why it works so well. A load of fun that escalates faster than you can blink.

193413712X|1.0|My sister loved this book. She found it \\"lyrical and tender,\\" a book that \\"resonated with [her] heart and soul.\\" I'm her younger brother, and I found it self-indulgent, pretentious, and worst of all, boring. No character development, no plot, no theme. Call me Old School, but these are the elements I expect in any self-respecting novel. My list of complaints could go on and on: passages of \\"precious\\" poetic prose which left me either laughing or shaking my head, unnecessary use of run-on sentences... right down to the lack of quotation marks. I can summarize my impression of Tinkers with this parody: \\"One hour before George died, a lightning bolt licked the darkened shore of the lake and Harold rose up from a caldron of frothy madness, skating a crimson tide, an old Belgian Cransondale clock main spring hanging stubbornly from his nostril, and he said, what's for dinner Katherine in a tone that meant the time is now when lightning burst from the top of his head.\\" Maybe my distain for this book is a guy-thing. Maybe it's a lack of a lyrical a tender heart and soul. All I know is my sister and I have never had such divergent views about the merits of a novel. She's ready to re-read Tinkers. I'm ready to re-read Anna Karenina.

B0036EH3X4|5.0|Lost is by far the best television show that has ever been on tv. This season didnt dissapoint i still felt the same spark that it had as the first season and when the final episode was over i was so sad i just sat on my couch and watched the credits shocked that it was finaly over. all i can say is that this show is the most emotional, suspensfull, and beutiful show i have seen or ever will see again.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|First of all Jane Eyre is maybe my favorite book of all time, it is one of my favorite books of the 1800s, I am a gothic lover. So I was pleased that it was being remade because I have been unsatisfied with the other versions. The best part of the movie is that it brings Jane and Rochester to life in the correct way, Jane is dowdy and plain and despite how superficial most movies and tv shows can be about looks, the costumes go out of their way to make the leads look as they should. My favorite performance was Tobby Stevens, Rochester can be tricky, he's a powerful controling man, who is also missing something that he desperatly wants and has given up on, I see the vulneblity in this portrayal, which is what makes the story. The actress who plays Jane is a close second, she is every bit Jane Eyre, and the only reason she is second to Stevens is that Jane is the easier character.<br /><br />The movie hits all the major scenes of the book, and does so with proper emotion and feeling. I believe the romance between Jane and Rochester and I feel the brokeness of each character and see the hope that they can be healed.  And yet, for some reason I was not totally blown away.  I think it is to do with the way the post wedding scenes were handled. In the book Jane's departure from Thornfield Hall was dramatic and heartwrenching, in the movie the wedding happens and suddenly she's on a rocky ledge. Those scenes eventually come, but by then she is out of danager and all emotional intensity is gone.
B004DK5CW4|2.0|Saw a youtube interview with Bill Nack, the author from whose book this supposedly \\"true story\\" movie was based.  In it he admits to greatly liking the movie and having fallen a bit in love with Diane Lane during his stint as film advisor.  I believe the falling in love part, but if he truly liked this movie he must not think much of his book, because it's everything this movie is not.  I guess it's hard to bite the hand that feeds him, no matter how much he'd like to.  If he could, I think we would have seen some unbelievable fangs.  When I watched this film, all I did was count the untruths and half-truths throughout, so I can just imagine what Mr. Nack went through.  That's no way to watch a movie, so my question is this:  Why change the truth when the true story is why you want to make the film in the first place?  My advice is to save your money and read Nack's book. The picture in your head will be ten times more enjoyable than anything you'll see on the screen.
0316098337|5.0|I loved this book! The plot was so intriguing and interesting I finished the book in 2 days. I would recomend this book to anyone who does not want a mundane everyday story line...
B000TEUSJK|1.0|A room mate in college who turned out to be a total reprobrate, cheat and liar dragged me to this movie when it was released in the 80s.  I wish I had left early, but only left nauseated.  Cant imagine why anyone would enjoy watching this then or now.
B004G6009U|5.0|I love to watch Disney movies with my little grandkids (age 5 and under), and they love watching them with me. Amazon has great deals on these movies. Tangled is one of the latest and I was able to get it through Amazon as soon as it became available.

B004I9TQLI|4.0|i've read some of these review where people seem to be confused by whether this is supposed to be aimed at kids, or aimed at adults and fails due to the reliance on Bruno's point of view. I think this film is actually an adult film and by having it seen through the eyes of an 8 year old boy helps to remind adults, and anyone over the age of 8, what such events might look like from his point of view. I was a little reluctant to see this, actually, and was a bit conflicted about the \\"idealization\\" aspect of it, but having watched the whole film now, it seems that that \\"lead-up\\" was necessary. Yes, Bruno was ignorant, but he was only 8! The ending shocked and horrified me, as it should. Of course I wanted his father to rush in and save everyone at the last minute. But for the film that this is, the ending was appropriate. This is not an adult, sweeping, complex, saga. But i do think it was an effective film -- not quite sure what the whole point of Rupert Friend's character was, except to very effectively be the very very \\"scary soldier\\" who is the closest in proximity to Bruno. Would recommend it, but not to anyone under 10 or 12.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've tried multiple different calendar and this one is definitely the best. Anyone looking for calendar substitute should buy this.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I've just finished watching the DVD version of this movie and have to agree with earlier commenters.    It is a TERRIBLE transfer -- the worst I've ever seen in a major release -- especially during the darker scenes, and scenes with static backgrounds.  The quality is so bad I was actually wondering if I might have somehow received a bootleg DVD -- until I remembered that I had ordered straight from Amazon.  Even the legalistic warnings at the beginning and end are fuzzy and grainy.    I too have to conclude this was intentional, and feel cheated and disrespected by the studio.  I suppose I am playing right into their hands in writing this, for my review will probably cause some people to now skip the DVD and buy the more expensive Blu-ray.    This release is really inexcusable.    This is a shame, as the movie itself is very, very good.
B004I4H8PO|2.0|Well you heard most of it before, two discs loose in box and one hidden. However I was lucky, no scratches and no glue. What nobody mentioned was the packaging of the vinyl in paper sleeves. High quality vinyl in a high priced set deserves rice sleeves. That's where mine went instantly. I would also like to take Amazon to task as I purchased from them. I know they always state that discs may come loose during shipment in multiple disc sets. Well the box set is plastic wrapped to a piece of cardboard. This in turn was placed in a box three times larger and shipped. No other packing material. I am not a shipper by trade but I think common sense would tell you that the box set would slide all around loosely in the larger box. Mine came with a nice big ding in the box set. Guess I will have to live with this for fear of getting scratched or glued discs upon an exchange.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Joe Satriani has the ability to bleed emotions through his guitar. At his best, he can hold me captive in the space between the notes and he does that here. This CD is a brilliant blend of jazz and blues, funky upbeats and bluesy torments. Each time I listen, I hear something new and feel something a little different.<br /><br />I saw Satriani perform this CD live when it was first released. His performance is truly magical. Black Swans & Wormhold Wizards captures the essence of that magic.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Sorry.  I used to consider myself a die-hard Star Wars fan over a decade ago. That was before the phantom poo poo...  The Special Editions were fun... but they were just that: Special Editions... NOT the originals. Sorry, George, you may have created the idea of Star Wars, but I'm of the mind that if it wasn't for the amazing creative crew behind you, the Star Wars films would never have flown. You owe it to them to show the world their hard work that helped make you famous. Those old effects were the gold standard at the time, before all the CGI. Let me write this again: those old effects are NOT obsolete, they are simply of another time. Another age of cinema that should not be forgotten.  There is NO reason to not include the originals. Even Ridley Scott and James Cameron and Peter Jackson release both versions of their films for THEIR fans.  You'll only get my money once you finally give in and give us the originals people grew up with.  ********************* 2015 UPDATE ***************************  What's the matter Disney ? You own this stuff now... Why not maximize sales by releasing something George Lucas HIMSELF never released before you purchased his franchise: The original unaltered trilogy on Blu-ray...
B004K4IZ54|5.0|This is a great Blu Ray. Picture and sound are both excellent. Also enjoyed the movie.  Pre-ordered this from Amazon and received it on the release date right on time. The price was reduced after I purchased and Amazon refunded me the difference.
B002ZG9800|5.0|Here's the thing, if you're even 1% homophobic, or even 1% of 1% homophobic, then don't bother with this movie. Seriously. And don't bother watching it with anyone who is even 1% of 1% homophobic either, because it'll really just ruin all the beauty of it. It's a shame, but it's true. I know my father and my best friend would love this movie, but I won't bother recommending it to them. They wouldn't be able to get past all the gay sex. And that's that.    Have you ever been in love? Steven Russell has. With inmate Phillip Morris. This movie was just beautiful all over, from the cinematography, to the acting, to the writing. It was just phenomenal. A true love story, but not corny in any way (which isn't easy). And to make a love story seem real and beautiful between two men without making either of them seem efeminate or emasculated is a true mark of a good storyteller. I just loved it. I loved their love. I felt their love and it was real. Google the real Steven Russell. Read his interviews in articles at NPR. The whole story is real, from start to finish. It all happened. It really did.
B003UESJFG|5.0|A very entertaining film for all ages.  It doesn't follow the \\"typical\\" good vs bad theme by adding its own twist to the story.  With the glut of computer animated films flooding the market, this one stands out.
B0042MDAL8|3.0|I bought the movie because I had the previous two in the series and I want to have the complete set. Not the best movie I've ever seen, but considering the books they are based on, they aren't too bad. :)

B003L5LEYW|5.0|Unlike most material currently on the radio, this album gives something to truly think about. Not specific to one group of peaple but to all people, no matter where u are or came from.

My 6 year old son was never into drawing and since buying Emberly's books my son is starting to take what he learned form the book and is now coming up with his own artwork. The books really simplify drawing different things though the use of shapes. We LOVE THEM so much we have bought 4 so far and my son is asking for more!

B001NEK2GE|4.0|The product is pretty straightforward to use, just plug it in and set the profile you want to use. However, the software can be buggy and slow sometimes (MacOSx). The product is pretty comfortable for about 5min laying flat, then my wrist starts to cramp.. So i have to but an object under the back of the device to lift so my hand doesn't hurt. All worth it tho, a lot better then a standard keyboard! (I play World of Warcraft with it) I use the keys for my attack moves, and the little joystick for movement (combined with the mouse)<br />I have my mount programed to both buttons near joystick, and my jump buttons are  G15 and G19. It seems to work Farly well. I don't really use the screen at all.. why should I look down? lol<br /><br />4/5
B0000CABBW|5.0|My friends in Australia encouraged me to watch this movie back in 2009 during my visit. I immediately fell in love with this movie. I had a very difficult time finding it in the United States where I live, but had no problems finding it online. I am so thrilled to now own this incredible movie. It is one of my all time favorites and I am sure it will be for years to come.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|A real eye opening portrait on the staggering degree of wanton but clever and integrated corruption in the US Financial system and Government. Astonishing (or maybe not) that still today little has changed in the form of oversight.
0767020308|5.0|I was going to avoid this film as I was I was under the impression that it would be contemporary with period dress. However, I decided to give it a go. Well I am pleasantly surprised to find that Jane Austin shows through on the film. Not maybe the heavy satirical Jane but the one I came to like in such films as \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" (1995).<br /><br />It is rural 1800s England. Young Emma Woodhouse (Gwyneth Paltrow) accidentally brings two people together to make a perfect match. Now she knows her avocation; it is a propensity to make other perfect matches. While rather poorly perusing her avocation she is unaware of her own feelings for her best friend and mentor, Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam).<br /><br />Of course we know what is going on from the get go. However it is fun anticipating Emma's mistakes and waiting for the lights to come on in this comedy of manners.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000E1ZKLE Sense and Sensibility [Blu-ray]]]
B002T9H2MO|5.0|In a time when most sci-fi flicks are littered with special effects to replace a good story, Moon is a great and surprising relief.  This movie has a solid storyline and top-notch acting by Sam Rockwell.  If you want a movie that captivates the mind, and also makes you feel a bit alone, this is your movie.
B004XCUEXY|5.0|They went through all that trouble to record a live performance in 3D and didn't make a Blu-Ray 3D version? I'm really disappointed! I've watched the documentary and it's great. Even if you're not a Foo Fighter follower, it's interesting to see the progression of the band. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Anyway.....PLEASE don't waste the 3D footage...make it available to us!
B003INBNXO|5.0|Superb story line.  Spectacular acting by Donnie Yen.  The historical basis was fascinating.  And the Wing Chun stayed true, authentic and well-choreographed and fast-paced!
B002UXRGLG|5.0|I was very happy to see that Life was narrated by David Attenborough. I had recently purchased the one narrated by Oprah.  It was very good, but David is the quintesential narrater.  His style is more educational, whereas Oprah's is more entertaining
B000RZIGVS|1.0|We were really bouyed with our last purchase of the Star Trek, TOS, but the Next generation packaging has totally let us down. Displeasure clearly emanates from following reasons  1) Disc seperators of very poor quality and starts breaking even if you try to open to retrieve the DVD, in fact some of them had gaping holes immediately after opening the package  2) Picture quality higly mediocre and hazy, gives impression of a shoddy job of DVD conversion  3) some discs have starting trouble and they stop at some places  4) Sound quality average    Overall package is dissappointing and clearly not worth the premium that is charged,
B004H4XJW6|5.0|I am proud to admit that this movie is one of my favorites even though I am 20 years old! The characters are easy to connect with and the story, while semi-predictable, is endearing. The humor is great and you may find yourself quoting some of the lines without even realizing (Ciao ciao, all!). Little kids will find this movie fun to watch and older viewers will most likely be just as entertained. I highly recommend this movie if you're interested in a movie that you will want to watch over and over and over again!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Great GPS sports watch with the following comments: GPS works AWESOME. Virtual Partner is FANTASTIC. The autopause and autoresume works GREAT, specially when I am on the bike and need to stop at red lights or so. The INTERNET upload and integration is VERY GOOD and Very useful, I hope Garmin continues to increase features here. GREAT PRODUCT TO HAVE AND TO KEEP TRACK OF YOUR WORKOUT RECORDS. Wish they would improve the following features: Wrist strap should be longer, specially if you have a large wrist. Battery should last longer. Sometimes it shows as 35% or more of battery left but just went down during the workout. The first setup with the computer was not that easy.
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|This is badly misrepresented. The light output appears to be closer to a 25W incandescent than to the claimed 50w. And the color temperature is much closer to a CFL than to a warm white incandescent.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is a warm fuzzy movie that can be watched and enjoyed over and over again. It's a beautifully done story that touches so many life experiences that we all have. This is a movie for ALL ages. Get it, watch it, enjoy it.
030726999X|1.0|I was so disappointed in the third and final book of this series!  I kept thinking \\"it will get better\\", but it never did.  The plot was mildly interesting, but the details drove me to distraction.  There were too many characters to keep up with and too much history of those characters to remember.  The book didn't flow smoothly, in my opinion.  Maybe my expectations are too high....I'd hoped the last book Larsson ever wrote would be more absorbing.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|the free version is awesome but the pro version is even better. being able to pause and rewind as well as record fm radio is a dream.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|The lines between good and evil are too clearly drawn in this film.  The American higher ups are Bush/Cheney era bad guys all the way.  George Clooney is the Middle East old hand who speaks Arabic so well that he receives complements from the locals.  At the same time Clooney's character is willing to knuckle under to his cynical higher ups for a while in hopes of getting the promotion that might allow him to send his DC area son to someplace more pricey than (heaven forbid!) University of Maryland.<br /><br />It is worth noting that the young men drawn into the terrorist mission in this film are not religious or political fanatics. They seem to sign up for this suicide operation in hopes of sending some much needed money to their families.<br /><br />My favorite line of the movie is spoken by Matt Damon as he comments on the traditional flowing robe attire of the Arab prince (Alexander Siddig--the physician in Deep Space 9) courted by the oil interests he represents : \\"Can you imagine playing baseball in that?\\"<br /><br />It is obvious that Arabic is not Siddig's native language.  His character speaks textbook Standard Arabic that is completely free from ties to any dialect.  This is not a bad thing though, as his Arabic dialogue is easy for a person such as myself to understand.<br /><br />Despite these various drawbacks, I found this movie fairly entertaining for a Hollywood star vehicle.

1599218011|5.0|I was suffering from horrible migraines when I turned to Kris Carr's \\"Crazy Sexy Diet\\" in hope of finding *something* that would help me out. I read the book in just a few days; Kris's writing style is engaging and fun. \\"Crazy Sexy Diet\\" totally exceeded my expectations in that it was funny, smart and informative. Some of what Kris suggested was a bit more than I was ready to commit to, but after reading about the effects of different foods and their preparation processes, I realized that my migraines were caused by dairy and now they're gone!
B0046HA25Q|4.0|Well Im new to running but these are a huuuge improvement on cheaper shoes ive owned ,really good fit and Im having quicker recovery times between runs ,pretty lightweight shoe but the downside to that is they dont have as much underfoot cushioning as some others ,want to upgrade the insoles to see if that improves things further ,did quite a bit of research into things before I bought them ,amazons delivery was prompt and would buy again from them anytime.    Im a pretty heavy foot planter so sometimes I wonder if these are right for me but they are for people with moderate pronating (rolling in) feet.  I will try some other top brands and see whats right for me but im pretty happy with these ,hard to tell unless you buy lots and use them for a few months ,trying on in a store only gives you an initial idea of fit ,when you buy high end shoes I think it takes more than just a fit in the store ,its trial and error really.
B004G600A4|5.0|Our family LOVES this movie!  We first saw it at the theatre and counted down the days until it was released on DVD.  Our new Disney favorite - and as a child who grew up on Disney classics, believe me when I say this is another classic!      And, the music is fantastic!  We find ourselves singing the songs all the time - LOL      Amazon ran the best price I was able to find on the DVD, and I had definitely been looking.  So, as usual, thanks Amazon!

B001LF3YQK|3.0|I like this case as you can hook it onto whatever you may need to, and it is easy open, but it doesn't keep your wipes moist.  I went to change my son while I was out and the wipes were dry.  Not a pretty picture.

B000O8OTNC|2.0|I don't know why other people rated this so highly.  I tried it on a pocket knife and I swear it got duller.  Then I resharpened it using the built-in knife sharpener that's at the back of my electric can opener--no problem--the knife is now sharp again.
B004XWLN20|5.0|It is with great sadness and fondness that I see the end of Smallville, the best show there has ever been. It has been an incredible journey spanning 10 wonderful years, and I am honored to have been a part of it all. I'm proud to have seen every single episode and to have shared in the iconic moments big and small. But, as they say, all good things must come to an end.    Sadly, those of you who are waiting and hoping for a Blu-ray release will more than likely be disappointed. It does not appear they have plans to release the series in that format. Some people (like myself) feel that the Blu-ray format will eventually go the way of HD DVD's. Some people feel Blu-ray technology is here to stay. Regardless of your opinion, I don't think DC will go through the trouble (or expense) to convert Seasons 1-4, which were only released in standard def, or Season 5, which was presented in HD-DVD format during it's short time on this earth.    I think this standard disc set will be fabulous no matter what. Aside from good transfer quality, I feel that features are what matter most, and this is filled with hours upon hours of exclusive features. And to those of you who have never watched the standard DVD's, let me tell you -they look amazing! I did have a PS3 at one time, so I've seen them in Blu-ray as well as standard, and with an upconverting standard DVD player, the quality isn't too terribly different.    All that being said, however, I do wish the box was a little more creative (in the shape of the Fortress of Solitude would have been nice, or maybe even Kal El's ship). I am willing to put that aside to enjoy all the great features that we are being given. This collection will live happily on my DVD shelf between Smallville, Season 10 and The Adventures of Superman - Season 1.    Any person who considers themselves a serious fan of Smallville should add this set to their collection, no matter what format it's in. I'm pre-ordering mine now, while the price is still so low(I imagine it will go up closer to release).
0316056863|2.0|I love Tina! I love comedy! I love reading! I love laughing while reading. For me, this book wasn't as funny as I had hoped.<br /><br />While I appreciated the memior I was surprised when I didn't feel it was candid enough. Maybe that was a conscious effort. There was a trauma as a child that she explains but doesn't elaborate one. Fine! I don't think she needs to give us the details, they are hers but I felt that she was approached to write a book and agreed but didn't really want to. There is humor, jokes, her interpretation on motherhood,womanhood, woman in the work place, and so on but I don't feel I learned anymore about her than what we already know.<br /><br />I did love her chapters on photoshots and photoshop. Hysterical!<br /><br />She is smart and funny, a good writer but as far as memiors go, this just didn't do it for me.  Still a Tina fan and have read way more good reviews for this book, people love it which is why I call myself the Amateur reviewer. What the heck do I know?
B000KJU1HI|5.0|The deluxe version of Don't Look Back includes an amazing outtakes DVD with footage of Dylan performing many of his best songs of this period in their entirety.  I think there must be 8 or 9 songs in the \\"1965 Revisited\\" DVD.  Definitely a must-see if you're a Dylan fan.  The descriptions of the deluxe DVD are not really clear about this--some make it sound as if it's only the audio portion of the song, but I was thrilled to discover that it is both video and audio of Dylan at his prime doing She Belongs to Me; It's All Over Now, Baby Blue; It Ain't Me Babe; and several others, all fully rendered.  This must be the best available collection of live Dylan in his prime.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This has promise to be a very addictive series. I hope there are more to come, because if that's where it ends I'm gonna be pissed.
B004XWLN20|3.0|Awesome series.  Got the first 9 seasons on dvd Black Fri. 2010 for 10 dollars each for a total of 90.  Would be worth 200 on blu-ray, but not dvd...
0060751967|2.0|I can't believe I bought this book. It's one of those books you read it till you get half way through, because you're expecting it to get better. It doesn't. The sense of humor in it is cheesy. You want a book thats hilarious with Vampires, demons, etc... Pick up a Kresley Cole book or a J.R. Ward.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you really should.  It was one of the funniest movies of the year and is perfect for both adults and children alike.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Fun while it lasted.   Not overly challenging.   Ending kind of dumb.  It looks like I have to write something else to get the minimum word number even though I was already done.
B004NOH9LW|1.0|What a bore fest. The movie starts out good and thats it. The rest is boring and unimportant. The scenes in the movie cut between one another and at one point i wondered why i was watching this. The ending was pretty Bad. Typical of romance movies.
B004XWLN20|3.0|I have 8 of these sets on and the last 3 on Blu-ray. I like many others would not buy this reguler DVD set since I already have it. What sence would that make? Just to have a beautiful box set! I don't think so. And I'm sure that Warner Bros. intends on releasing A Blu-ray set.  Bob \\"Ziggy\\" Anderson
030746363X|5.0|This is a huge book and full of lots of ideas. Most ideas are not new, but the author has combined ideas that have worked for him. I found it entertaining to read a great reference.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Having some personal family history with the thief that is Alzheimer's Disease, I could NOT put this book down.  It is such a powerful and compelling read.  This book will leave you better (more compassionate, more understanding, more insightful) than it found you.<br /><br />Thank you, Ms. Genova.
0316010669|5.0|A lot of social scientists really turn me off.  I'm curious about the topics, but what happens is it ends up being a liberal treatise of social crap not worthy of my time (note: the opposite is true- liberals don't want to read a conservative treatise also).  I find Gladwell's work entertaining and informative.  Worthy of the read and gives me something to think about.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|Ben Stiller wrote and starred in this boring, overly offensive vanity \\"comedy.\\"  It is a spoof of male models and fashion industry, which evolves into a sort-of political statement drama on child labor.  Every scene is stupid and many are offensive.  The stars that agreed to be in this should be embarrassed (Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson).  It is not  even worth one star, but it got as far as a DVD.  The sex and drugs in this grasping for laughs movie offends and becomes boring.  I thought there would be a few laughs, but was very wrong.<br /><br />No redeeming value
039472903X|5.0|What makes this book great?  Everything.  This book has it all because it lives up to what it's trying to convey and teach to the reader.  Most books need just words on a paper to convey thought & provide imagery etc.  When an author is discussing advertising, especially when illustrations are involved, you want to see the ad copy in the book also- the visual and verbal are equally important in this case.  That's where this book delivers.  The author presents the ad copy, then writes the play by play, or the backstory, of the ad- how it came to be, or why it is the way it is, or some type of research tidbit etc.    Who should read this?    - graphic artists  - those involved in any type of marketing.. doesn't matter what, will help your mental juices to flow  - entrepeneurs
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is a really good album from the Clash! It would be really hard to describe this but I will try, so it is kind of like a blend of rock, punk, and reggae. Buy this album you won't regret it!
072325804X|5.0|A little three-and-a-half year old girl had recently discovered Peter Rabbit, Mr. McGregor and other characters of Beatrix Potter's creation, and so it was that her grandparents got her, along with a delightful little Peter Rabbit figurine, \\"Beatrix Potter--The Complete Tales\\" for Easter.   She was instantly captivated, and has already delightedly made additional acquaintanceships with Hunka Munka, Jemima Puddle-Duck, and the rest. This is a book that will be on her shelf for years--read to her now by mom and dad; read by herself in a few years; and read to her own kids in years far into the future.     These tales are a century old and have remained in print over that span for a very good reason. They are wonderful fantasies that nonetheless reveal Potter's insight into animal--and human--behaviors, and the illustrations are exquisite evocations.  There is also a note at the beginning of each tale about its origins and a bit about Beatrix Potter's life at the time, which offers great perspective for adult readers of the tales.     If there were 6 stars available, that's what I would assign to this fine collection.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I don't know what I'd do without this little accessory for my iPad... I use it every few days to down load photos from my camera to my iPad.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This thing is worth every penny. It's the most bang you get get for your dollar. I've got this on an AMD Phenom II 1090T with IC Diamond 24 karat thermal compound and the temp never goes above 40C. It idles in windows 7 64bit at 27C with the fan at ~550RPM. It comes with brackets to mount a second 120mm case fan to run a push-pull set up if you really need to do that. Only problem with it is it's size. If you're running a smaller box, you shouldn't get this, it probably won't fit, and if you have a whole mess of ram with enormous heat spreaders, it may not fit. For a smaller box, look at the Zalman cpu coolers, they are more expensive, but they fit a little better in smaller profile cases.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very light weight,and easy to use. Applies a very keen edge. A few good strokes thru the ceramic side, and you have a very sharp and lasting edge. I do not own a knife that would need the carbide side, sorry. The diamond rod works well on serrated blades. Overall a very good product.
B004FOA84A|3.0|i was able to play right after i installed but now it keeps force closing. I would give five stars if it didn't force close
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Really WONDERFUL read. Everyone I've recommended this book to has loved it too!! If you liked the Twilight saga, you'll love this book. It's for an older audience than Twilight. I highly recommend!!!!
B004M66YSA|5.0|Best album since Cee Lo Greene's \\"Lady Killer\\" and Hurts' \\"Happiness\\"<br /><br />Reminescent of Smashing Pumpkins, Cure, New Order, but more low-key.<br /><br />Warm lucious androgynous vocals, catchy melodes, and shoegazer pop euphoria.<br /><br />My favorite album of 2011 as of April 29th 2011.<br /><br />Get it on vinyl!  Forget CDs and MP3s, can't get the true vibe.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|One of my favorite current movies.  Loved it !  As you get older you appreciate the idea of an after-life.
0670022411|5.0|This book met my criteria for a really good read - any time I had even 5 or 10 minutes to spare, I picked it up.  Wonderful combination of history and mystery and magic and love, I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for a follow-up.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|This is a great collection of the Eagles hits, performed very well in concert. I noticed a couple of things with the audio that I wasn't too crazy about, however. One, it doesn't sound like a concert but sounds more like a studio recording because the acoustics of the arena and the audience noise is minimal. So it sounds like they are in your living room rather than being viewed in a large hall concert venue. Some of you may prefer that, but the sound doesn't match the setting to me.  Secondly, the bass, especially the kick drum, is very prominent in the mix. I had to turn down the subwoofer a few notches to make it more balanced.     The concert itself is great - they play a wide selection of their hits and the musicianship is precise. Very well done, but with the caveats on the audio portion I mentioned above.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|The dvd is in perfect condition. Awesome dvd for a couple bucks. All I could find in the store was the dvd and blue ray set for $30.00. All I wanted was the dvd. Good ole amazon pulled through for me again!
B002C1BHIO|5.0|Perfect cable. There really is no need to spend an excessive amount on so called \\"Much better quality HDMI cables.\\"
0062060554|3.0|In this well-written \\"thriller\\", Christine wakes up every day unsure of who she is, unable to believe she is the middle-aged woman in the mirror.  She can't remember her husband or the life they led together.  She can't remember anything.  Eventually she finds a journal and learns she has been seeking answers and then the book builds to an interesting climax that I won't reveal here.<br /><br />This story is solid and engaging, but I just never got the spine-tingling thrill I had expected.  It was an interesting read, and I did enjoy it, but the lack of real tension as the book moved towarded the big denouement made it easy to put down when interrupted.  I was left feeling vaguely let down and dissatisfied which is why I'm only giving it 3.5 stars.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|I fell asleep after i lost interest.  I usually try to finish a  bad movie just to find out what happens but these two actors were bogus together.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I'll borrow the paper version from a friend that has an extra set that she loans out... I refuse to pay that much MORE for a digital copy! The pricing is crazy!
B0029LHWFO|5.0|After all the hype and nonsense surrounding a presidential candidate, it was wonderfully refreshing to read his own autobiography which helped me understand the man he became. He starts from his childhood, does a great job of describing the family members that loved and raised him; the differences between living in Indonesia, Hawaii and then Chicago.<br />He has a great writing style and his self critique and awareness made the book for me.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that his trip to Africa was a lot like my trips to Italy, meeting the myths, the cousins, their expectations, and the realities.<br />Good book. I recommend it.
B00004TXFX|2.0|I ordered two of the AIC Ungplugged DVD's. Neither will play in any of my new DVD or BlueRay players. I had to bust out an old modded XBOX that I had to watch them. One sounds great but the other had high music sound but low vocals, barely hear Layne or Jerry singing. Both will play on my laptop and computers. I read and asked the seller about the region 1 codec. They stated that they would play but in reality they only play on older DVD players and on PC's. I paid $10 a piece so I guess I'm not complaining too much but it is an inconvenience. It will cost me more than I paid to ship them back and get my money so I am going to keep them. One positive if the video quality is great. The packaging (case) leaves me to believe these were dubbed cuz they came from the UK. I could have done that on a torrent site but...well I didn't. It's a hit of miss with these so be careful. If you're expecting something from Best Buy don't count on it.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|great music and talent...lot's of fun!  They don't get any better than Jeff.  I just saw him live in concert.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Short answer - this is good.  I just bought my second one after having put the first through some tests and realizing I should havea  back-up.  I bought it mostly for the diamond point.  I can sharpen a straight blade in many ways, the serrated edges though are always a hard thing to get sharp.  As part of my testing I took this to work and used it to sharpen or touch up a variety of knives.  OK, it's geeky, but we were all impressed with the abilities of this simple to use and carry tool.  For most sharpening applications - good steel that just needs a hone - use the ceramic side. Most knives will be like-new sharp after this. The carbide groove is for serious re-eding and will take off a lot of steel so go easy.
0470876417|5.0|This is a remarkable resource for leaders attempting to rethink their business's approach to the market. A wonderful tool for aligning ones team against value creation and mapping a strategy for developing current and new strengths.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|If I could, I'd give this movie less than one star. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The combinaton of blatant sex and violence just put me off. Yes I'm an older female person. But my husband and my brother didn't even sit through till the end. I hadn't read any reviews before I purchased the movie which I wanted because the actress got the Academy Award for acting.  Next time I'll be more careful.
B000002B7O|5.0|I had to settle for a used copy of the out-of-print 1995 cd this review is for, but it was worth it.  The 2002 version with newly recorded bass and drums by different musicians...what an awful idea.  I read an interview recently on Blabbermouth.net where Ozzy basically blamed Sharon for that release, stating that he didn't even know it was being done and that he demanded that the original be restored after he found out.  Whatever the truth of it is, I would still go for this 90's copy before any newer version.  It sounds great and surely won't be improved upon by any new re-master.  I will still probably get the upcoming Legacy Edition for the bonus live disc, but being a longtime Ozzy fan, I'd still want the '95 version in my collection.<br /><br />What can you really say about the songs?  It has the rock radio staples Over the Mountain and Flying High Again; fan favorite heavy metal tracks like Believer and S.A.T.O.; epics like You Can't Kill Rock & Roll and the title track.  Ozzy's voice in '82 was captivating, and Randy Rhoads was the guitar god he's made out to be today.  I always go back and forth between this and Blizzard as my favorite solo Ozzy album.  Blizzard gets points for the strength of certain individual songs, but I think I like Madman more as an entire album.  Either way, remember to stay away from the 2002 travesty that even Ozzy says never should have happened.<br /><br />(FYI, the link to that Blabbermouth article is in the comment below the review.)
0307454541|5.0|That's the first thing that comes to my mind...WOW. This book really grabbed me by the jugular and didn't let go. I really like a good mystery and this book certainly was mysterious. Talk about a wild roller coaster ride! This had me up, down and twisted in all different directions. I was continuously kept on the edge of my seat and I picked the book up every time I had the chance. I hated to lay it down.<br /><br />When you meet Lisbeth, well, she's an experience that you won't ever forget. In fact, the whole book is an experience that you won't ever forget. Pick it up...read it!!!
B001K3JF7K|4.0|Lovely CD--I have become a real fan.  Friends on facebook posted some of her music and I really liked it.  Then a friend in CA had some for sale and I bought all six.  She is my waking up music--thru the day and then to go to sleep.  I look forward to her CD in Paris.  Highly recommended to all.
0525423273|5.0|After hearing so many rave reviews about Anna and the French Kiss, I knew I had to read it. Though, with all the hype about this book I thought it was too good to be true. I mean how good could it possibly be? You want to know how good? Absolutely beyond amazing. I was very happy to find out that every single one of those reviews were 100 percent true!<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss is a story about friendship, love, heartbreak and making mistakes that'll leave you wanting more. I found myself completely enthralled with every word. The humorous dialogue was something I just couldn't get enough of. It had me giggling and wanting to cry right along with its characters. Perkins authentic ability to tell the story from a teenager's perspective was phenomenal. I really felt that I connected with Anna. She's funny, witty, eccentric and has her own quirks and awkward moments, but honestly, who doesn't? I think that made her all the more believable than some façade of perfection. She's a great, strong character that anyone can easily relate to.<br /><br />Étienne St. Clair... *swooooooon* I need to point out the fact that he is American, British AND Parisian (Don't get it? Go read the book ASAP to find out! ;) ) and has beautiful hair. Who could resist that?! It's totally a swoon-worthy combination. He's endearing, sometimes vulnerable, sweet and compassionate and everything you could want in a cute boy. I loved all his Briticisms throughout the book!<br /><br />One of my most favorite things about this novel is how effortlessly Anna and him became best friends above everything else. They have such a solid relationship and great chemistry. The romance between the two was gradually built up instead of a kind of \\"love at first sight\\" thing, which gave it a sense of realism. They took the time to really know each other first. I could literally feel the tension every time they brushed legs whilst sitting next to each other or glanced at each other out of the corner of their eyes. You always know you've found an author with a true talent for writing when you get butterflies while reading as if all these interactions are happening to you.<br /><br />The setting is just to die for. I've never been to Paris or really had much of an interest in it - trust me, I do now - but Perkins is so stunningly detailed in her descriptions of the city that you feel like you are experiencing it right there alongside Anna. I truly enjoyed imagining the museums, theatres and restaurants - I think I need to go there just to taste the yummy sounding food! I most certainly wouldn't mind being shipped off to boarding school in Paris, especially if I met someone like Étienne!<br /><br />I'm glad Anna and the French Kiss lived up to my expectations and that it was so huge in the blog world or I probably would have gone forever without this fantastic book in my life. It's charming, romantic, funny and just left me with a good feeling after reading it. Ms. Perkins' writing style is unique and invigorating. I'm eager to see what epicness she has written about in the companion novel, Lola and the Boy Next Door, which comes out later this year.
B000085RPU|5.0|Not only was this a technological breakthrough combining live action with animation the story line is actually quite good. My children & I love to watch this one over and over again.
B000063DIR|1.0|If the other 80+ one-star reviews aren't enough to convince you that this 2002 version, with re-recorded bass and drums by different musicians, should be avoided at all costs, take Ozzy's word for it.  I read an interview recently on Blabbermouth.net where he basically blamed Sharon for that release, stating that he didn't even know it was being done.  He claims that after he found out about it, he told her that he wanted the original version restored and that he \\"wouldn't have done that.\\" (the link is in the comment below the review)<br /><br />Get the 1995 out-of-print cd or the upcoming Legacy Edition that will include a previously unreleased live disc of a concert with Randy Rhoads.  As for this mistake...even Ozzy says it shouldn't have happened.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|With this app, i can listen to talk radio broadcasts that arent available in my rural area and record them if i miss them as well. Some of the programs arent available on Satellite, nor does the host provide a way to download previous shows. This is fantastic and does everything well, no FC's, abnormal battery drain, it just works well!
0812973992|3.0|I've said for some time now, which is truly a reflection on my own aging process, that I find literary novels to be a waste of time.  They are not relevant to the world, there is nothing propelling the plot along, they are, simply, great character pieces with, if you're lucky, sometimes great writing.  Colum McCann can write and he does it well here.  But this book seems more like a writing class assignment than anything else.  I give him credit for taking ten or so different characters and giving them not only their own voice but their own distinctive writing style.  And like most literary novelists, he leaves no stone unturned, letting us the reader know everything about these individual characters.  Unfortunately, that does not make for a good read. So, not only is there nothing moving this book along, not only is there not a central beloved character in the absence of a central plot, but the book has both no relevance to the world today, because it's set in the '70's, nor to itself.  The characters have the thinnest of connections to each other and barely share the same overriding background: the highwire tightrope from one twin tower to the other by Philippe Petit.  Somebody just asked me if I recommended this book, and I had to tell them no.  McCann gets a 5 for writing, but a 1 for plot.
014305841X|3.0|The content of this book is interesting and informative, but I found it very difficult to listen to due to the sarcastic nature of the readers voice.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|First off unless you own or plan to purchase a dedicated headphone amp, keep looking.  Low output devices like the iPod or the headphone output port of your Mac/PC or receiver will not power these phones enough to get the performance these phones are capable of. So why buy a fairly expensive product if you're not going to achieve what they're capable of? As far as burn in time, it took me a good 500 hours before they really sounded good. In fact I kept noticing improvement up to 1000 hours. Get a good CD with tracks designed to maximize  the break-in process. Ayer Acoustics has a disc entitled \\"Irrational, But Efficacious System Enhancement Disc\\" for about $20. it's money well spent. Also the stock cable is just so-so, but they're are companies making superior after market cables which are a snap due to a detachable cord feature.   Out of the box they sounded crisp and edgy high end that I did not care for. As I kept breaking them in there really wasn't much of an improvement and I got completely discouraged. A guy online said \\"just keep at and they;ll come around\\" So I set up both pink noise, brown noise, and music play thought them 24/7 for a week. When I went to listen, my jaw hit the ground! They sounded completely transformed. Gone was the brittle high end and the edginess. The high end was crisp and accurate, the bass was punchy and well defined and the mids were nothing short of wonderful. One this being of an open backed design, quite a bit of sound leaks into the room and you hear sounds going on around you. Everyone will know what you're listening to. So if sound isolation is important, keep looking. They're very comfortable as the ear pads completely surround your ears and rest comfortably on your head. The only complaint I can come up is they're mostly made of plastic without any real dampening materials the Sennheisers are fashioned from. Still that's a minor complaint as as long they're treated the way any high-end component should be treated, they should last for years.
0316056863|5.0|Got through Fey's book in a few days and find myself wishing there was another 300 pages! I'm a fan of 30 Rock and SNL and there's plenty of \\"behind-the-scenes\\" stuff on those two shows. But like others, I came away seeing Fey as a \\"Real American!\\" who loves her family, still has her flaws yet seems to take the balancing act that is life all in stride. Hilarious read about a woman whose work I have admired for years.
1932100660|5.0|Beyond important information - this is essential information.      I believe this is the most important book about health  (and the destructive wheels behind the scenes) that has ever been written. The authors tone is calm, informative, nonjudgemental - despite the urgency of the info and deception that is trying to keep this information from the public, all in the name of greed.      I have read numerous books giving personal accounts of how changing ones diet has improved disease after disease, but this book is the proof.     I URGE YOU TO READ THIS BOOK.
B004PEJ1H0|5.0|Impressive single. Each listen it grows on me more. The perfect song for a comeback after what he's gone through. George looks like he's finally getting it together to continue doing what he does best, making music!
B000025XKM|5.0|Clocking in at under 29 minutes, and just the sound of Nick Drake's voice and guitar (with a touch of piano on the title track) Pink Moon is an undeniable masterwork by a pure, deeply troubled, genius. It would be the last record of Drake's short life. As the story goes Pink Moon was made with just recording engineer John Wood in the studio, and it was realized in only two late night sessions. Apparently when the session was finished he dropped the tapes off at the front desk of his record label without a word. From start to finish, Pink Moon is miraculous; raw, confessional and stark. The bleakness of the proceedings is leavened by Nick Drake's wonderful, intricate fingerstyle guitar work and his gorgeous, rich other-worldly voice. From the Morning ends the album on an optimistic note, but it belies all the songs that preceed it. Every track on Pink Moon is essential to the whole. What is most astounding about Pink Moon is that it is utterly timeless. Almost any other recording of the period, whether it was British or American, would be heard today as a product of the early 1970s. Not Nick Drake's work. And his guitar playing, with tricky open-tunings, was so technically outstanding. While Volkswagen has been alternately praised and lambasted for using the song Pink Moon to sell cars, the auto-maker did a great service by making this beautiful album known to a wider audience. No music collection is complete without Pink Moon, Bryter Layter and Five Leaves Left. Essential!!
B004NSULHM|1.0|This will be the last time I buy a Radiohead album without serious consideration.  They no longer deserve the benefit of the doubt.  King of Limbs comes across as a successor to The Eraser - dull, unfinished, and mostly devoid of melody ... and guitars!  I'm very disappointed with this purchase, but thankfully there's a lot of other good bands and music out there to fill the void left by one of the most talented rock groups ever.
0230749615|5.0|I have an in home daycare and my daycare children just love the Gruffalo books   write some more!!!
B004NSULHM|5.0|This is their masterpiece. It hits you softly, but yet boldly, on so many levels. It gets better after every listen. I thought they never could top Kid A, but they did with this one. A marvelous album for those who appreciate good music as good art.
1593979827|5.0|This exploration of metaphysical values is astute, pellucid and intriguingly interwoven with a semi-fictional construct that takes a catastrophic turn with the afterword information that the author's son / protagonist was murdered five years after the book appeared. Philosophically, the book is a calm, plain-spoken assault on Western concepts of rationality and subject-object dialectic. (Of course, to make the process complete, we should also have a non-rational but equally effective assault on non-Western synthesizing and holistic metaphysics.) I listened to this as an audiobook, which I think was an effective way to assimilate what otherwise might be tedious philosophic discourses.
B0037HOWKM|2.0|I've been building Legos for years. I was very excited when I heard about Nanoblocks because the idea of doing miniature block designs seemed awesome. Unfortunately, there are two BIG problems with Nanoblocks. First, the blocks do not fit snugly and therefore easily fall apart when putting the structures together. Nanoblocks are a little better than some other Lego imitations (e.g., MegaBlocks), but they are far inferior to Legos. Second, the instructions are very difficult to follow. The pictures are too small, and the way you're supposed to assemble the structures in not intuitive. Assembling this Castle was more difficult (and therefore less fun) than Lego sets, even the ones that are recommended for kids over age 16.
B00275EGWY|2.0|Received the DVD in more than average  mailing time. I received the DVD in just a plain wrapper taped to a piece of cardboard and NOT in the commercial DVD case with the full color promotional/descriptive liner. Had I known I was going to get just the DVD I would have shopped elsewhere. Nowhere was there a description that said DVD only!
B001BPQT8A|5.0|I'm watching the game on TV.  Suddenly the doorbell rings.  My wife and I both race to the door.  Unfortunately she is the faster and signs for the box from UPS.  We retreat back to the TV room.  I can hardly contain my eagerness to see what's in the box.  She opens it just far enough to see what's in the box and then she quickly shuts it, putting it out of my reach.  \\"What's in the box\\" I ask?  \\"Nothing!\\"  \\"Aw, what's in the box?\\"  I'm starting to get frantic now.  \\"Come on, what's in the box?\\"  \\"WATCH THE GAME!!!!\\"  \\"WHAT'S IN THE BOX!!!\\"  \\"PLEASE WHAT'S IN THE BOX?\\"  \\"COME ON, WHAT'S IN THE BOX?\\"  Finally she pulls a Blu-ray disc out of the box and says........We'll just have to watch it to find out!
B0026LYM5U|5.0|I never thought I would say this, but perhaps it was for the best that Anneke left The Gathering. \\"Home\\" is by far their worst record, and Anneke's subsequent output has ranged from disappointing (Air) to embarrassing (In Your Room). If this is the kind of music she wants to make now, she made the right choice in leaving.   Contrary to some other reviewers, I think \\"The West Pole\\" shows how little Anneke brought to the creative process in The Gathering. To be sure, her voice is spectacular and it is missed on this record, but Silje does a fine job, as do the other guest vocalists. The songwriting on this record is top notch and has some of the best material we've seen from the band in years. Can't wait for the next release.
0439023521|4.0|When I first picked it, I wasn't sure if i picked the right book to read, the description for this book is quite vague. Going into the read, I was unsure what to think. Luckily, it turns out that the book is a great read and really is hard to put down. I finished the whole thing in one weekend and only stopped when I absolutely had to. Anybody who enjoys suspenseful novels will enjoy this book. The book will be enjoyed by both kids and adults. I am rating this book at 4/5 because there are some minor parts in the book that aren't fully explained, or don't quite make sense..
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I've been using the free version of this app for the longest time now, and found the pro version here when Amazon had it as the daily featured app.  It's the best streaming radio app I have found so far, and the only one that has the one station I actually want to stream the most.<br /><br />The only problem I have is it skipping sometimes when running in the background, but I blame my lower-end phone (HTC Hero) not being able to handle it like that.
B003EY7IRC|2.0|I had this book at the top of my Amazon wish list last Christmas.  It was given to me as a gift and delivered the day it was released.  A pretty clear indication of how BORING it is would be the fact that I'm writing this review on the last day of April.  It took me forever to wade through it.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert--paragraph below tells one of the few things of interest that happens in the book.<br /><br />Once I figured out Barons wasn't dead, I lost interest.  I really didn't care about the rest of the motley cast of charaters and it took way, way to long to find out what their back stories might be.  The Scotsmen are interesting fellows in their own series but totally useless in this one.  I think the author had an intersting premise when she started the series but ran out of ideas on how to end it.  AND she leaves us still wondering what in the heck Barons is.  At this point I'm starting to not care and probably won't buy another in the series.<br /><br />That's really sad because I really liked Mac as a character, but even she's gotten boring.

0553386794|5.0|This book was indeed very well-written and worth reading. BUT... I was very disappointed with some of the things that were referenced and scenes that were very detailed having to do with sex. I thought that these were not needed. I personally do not think that these scenes needed to be in there, but for people it may be okay or even a plus. I would really like to give this book a 3.5 star counting. I wasn't overly impressed with the plot itself and for me it was really hard for me to stay focused. This took me a week and half to finish, but then you also have to understand I just read a 518 pg. book in a day and a half. If those scenes were not in there I'd give the book a 4.5 star rating. The book is very well- written just not a book I would not go out and buy.

B0000029AL|5.0|Great memories....This was the first album ever I bought in 1975 or so. I use to just let this album play the whole time I was in my room, I was like 14 years old but I knew good rock music. This album holds a special place for me and I want to experience that Aerosmith feeling again.<br /><br />Here it is some 37 years and I'm sitting here listening to Aerosmith's first album and enjoying every second, I remember playing this on a old record player with one speaker and loving it.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this album, and it's a good place to start if you're a real Aerosmith fan, and the next 4 albums after this are super as well. This album has it's own voice and should be played again again and you'll see what I mean :)

B003ASLJO0|5.0|GRAN TORINO was directed by Mr. Clint Eastwood and it stars Mr. Eastwood. The story was by Dave Johannson and Nick Schenk.  The movie lives and breathes humanity. The movie is almost like a melange of CRASH (2004) starring Matt Dillon, ALL IN THE FAMILY (1971-1979) starring Caroll O'Conner, and MEN OF HONOR (2000) starring Cuba Gooding. On one or two occasions, GRAN TORINO shows the grittiness of THE PAWNBROKER starring Rod Steiger.  Throughout the film, there are near-continual undercurrents of tension, where one might expect an outburst of some sort to occur.  There are no weak periods in this film.  There is no filler in this film.      Here are a few comments:    (A)  MEDIATING BETWEEN TWO CULTURES.  Ahney Her, who plays Mr.Eastwood's neighbor, will steal your heart.  She serves as a go-between, mediating communication between the traditional American culture and the traditional Hmong culture.  She is fluent in the Hmong language, and fluent in English, and she has no trace of accent when she speaks English.  The film becomes ever the more powerful, towards the end, when she become a tragic figure.  The Hmong language actually consists of a group of dialects, spoken by Hmong people of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, northern Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos.    (B)  WHAT MATTERS MOST IN LIFE.  The film identifies what is the meaning of life.  For some people, the essence of the meaning of life is to discover the cure for cancer.  This goal is reachable by only a select few, such as Prof.D.Slamon, the inventor of trastuzumab.  But for others, such as the character played by Mr.Eastwood, meaning of life comes from teaching somebody self-respect, and teaching somebody a new skill.  Perhaps, that is what GRAN TORINO is all about.    (C)  SELF-SACRIFICE.  Regarding the ending of the film, this film takes exactly the same approach as that taken in Mr.Eastwood's other movie, SPACE COWBOYS.  The approach is this.  A man who knows he is terminally ill sacrifices himself todo a good deed.  This approach is emphasized by a crack in the sidewalk, in a scene at the end of GRAN TORINO.  The use of this symbolic crack is a work of pure genius. (I'm not telling you what it is. There is no need for a \\"spoiler alert\\" at this point.)    (D) CIGARETTE LIGHTER.  This is about the cigarette lighter bearing an insignia.  GRAN TORINO has the recurring theme of a cigarette lighter bearing an insignia.  This exact theme occurs in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  In STRANGER ON A TRAIN, the lighter has a picture of golf clubs, a symbol dear to the heart of the protagonist.  In GRAN TORINO, the lighter had a symbol of a U.S. military group from the Korean war, a symbol dear to the heart of the protagonist. My understanding is that STRANGER ON A TRAIN is frequently used as a teaching device in film school.  Hence, the use of this particular theme in GRAN TORINO cannot be said to be a coincidence.  There is nothing wrong with recycling themes.  In fact, when themes are recycled, this enables contemporary cinematographers to stand on the shoulders of earlier cinematographic giants (to paraphrase Isaac Newton).    (E) CATHOLICISM.   GRAN TORINO is a fine educational device for those interested in knowing what is Catholicism.  For those totally naive in matters relating to Christianity, and to Catholicism in particular, this movie seems to provide a practical, fair-minded, and favorable accounting of this religion.  In contrast, it is the case that many other Hollywood productions characterize Catholicism as a cult that is obsessed with witch hunting and exorcism, or as a religion for simpletons (as in, AS GOOD AS IT GETS, starring Helen Hunt as the Catholic).    (F)  STAR WARS CANTINA SCENE.  GRAN TORINO never lets up with its continual entourage of clever scenes.  When Mr.Eastwood eventually goes to the clinic, he finds himself in a waiting room filled with foreigners.  There is an Indian woman.  There is an East Asian man.  The receptionist is Ethiopian Moslem woman.  When the receptionist calls out, \\"Mister Kowalski,\\" her accent is so strong, one can almost feel Mr.Eastwood cringing because of how poorly his name is being pronounced.  By the time this scene arrives, the viewer of GRAN TORINO is already aware that the qualities of Mr.Eastwood's neighborhood that were known to him, from the happy years 1950 to 1980, have simply disintegrated into nothingness.  To avoid dropping into the hole of existential nothingness, Mr.Eastwood clings to the few remaining things that he can, almost obsessively so.  These include Mr.Eastwood's unending parade of Pabst beer, his Italian barber friend, and the rituals of mowing his lawn and polishing his GRAN TORINO.  Anyway, the scene at the waiting room in the doctor's office, with its bizarre melange of different nationalities, reminded me of the STAR WARS cantina scene in located in the city of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine.    (G)  NAMES.  Naming is a concept normally studied by Ph.D. students in philosphy, psychology, and literature.  Thousands of college professors have carved out their career by studying the symbolism of names, that is, names of characters in books and plays.  This particular movie contains the interesting theme of names.  Towards the beginning of GRAN TORINO, Clint Eastwood complains when the priest calls him \\"Walt,\\" and demands that he be called, \\"Mr. Kowalski.\\"  Eventually, Mr.Eastwood softens, and reluctantly allows the priest to call him, \\"Walt.\\"  At about the same time, Ahney Her, the charming Hmong teenager, calls him, \\"Wally.\\"  Mr.Eastwood raises a protest, but it is modest, and he finds himself feeling comfortable when Ahney Her calls him, \\"Wally.\\"  An explanation is at hand.  What does the priest have to offer Mr.Eastwood?  Nothing.  And what does Ahney Her have to offer Mr.Eastwood?  Plenty -- her family provides him with tasks that provide meaning to his life, including, making humble household repairs, teaching Ahney's brother how to talk like a confident man, teaching Ahney's brother a trade (carpentry), and protecting Ahney from neighborhood gangs.  Then, towards the end of the movie, the issue of names comes up again in the clinic, where the Ethiopian reception mangles Mr.Eastwood's name to the point where it is almost unrecognizable.  She calls, \\"Mister Kwaaski?  Mister Kwaaski?\\"    (H)  AIRHEAD.  This is about actor Dreama Walker.  Ms. Dreama Walker is a professional actor who has been in dozens of films.  She plays the airhead.  Her character is simultaneously charming and nauseating.  Dreama Walker's character fits squarely in the tradition established by Alicia Silverstone in CLUELESS and by Moon Unit Zappa in her song, VALLEY GIRL.  The airhead seems to be a new literary invention, as I am not sure if any character of this type has ever appeared, for example, in the works of Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Moliere, or Shakespeare.     No review can do justice to the intelligence, insight, humor, and humanity, that is found in GRAN TORINO.  While this film certainly does not provide insight regarding EVERY aspect of the human condition, it does provide a compelling narrative regarding relations between young versus old, American versus foreign, naive versus savvy, and so on.  As a comment on the \\"human condition,\\" I find this film is as remarkable as any piece of literature coming from the pen of Shakespeare, Dostoyevski, or Melville.  But a difference between GRAN TORINO and the works of Shakespeare, Dostoyevski, and Melville, is that you do not need a Ph.D. in literature to understand GRAN TORINO.   Five trillion stars for this one.
B0006L16N8|5.0|There is no word which can conjugate teh perfeccion of this album. Every song is better than the last, there is a wide variety of instruments and arrangments. It is almost a crime to put this many good songs in one album.    there are the most famous songs that you'd have to be dead if you hadn't heard them at some point. But there are some nice little suprises at the end of the album: \\"Swallowed in the sea\\" and \\"Till kingdom Come\\". Theses have now become my favorite coldplay songs,     \\"Swallowed in the sea\\" has beautifully thought out lyrics, a true contribution to the album. It is almost poetry.  \\"till Kingdom come\\" even thouhg it has a very slow intro it slowly build up to the chorus.(hidden track)    This album is a vitality, if you enjoy any coldplay song.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem is my one of my favorite rappers and this is his best album to date. It includes some of the best rap songs ever recorded including The Way I Am and Bitch Please II. Nonetheless there is only one song on this album that is not that good (Drug Ballad) and every single other song is perfect. The album flows perfectly together and is lyrically incredible. Most people thought Eminem was going to hit a sophomore slump but this blows his first album away. Every beat is perfect... every rhyme is unique and every featured artist does an awesome job. I can't express enough my love for this album except to say that it can't be beat. All his albums are great but I just wish they were all THIS great.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio is a truly great follow-up to the original Angry Birds with enough differences to make it worthy of a release and emough similarities to keep it genuine. Just as addictive too.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I loved this cd so much brought many copies as gifts for my friends. This is loving dog shows reminds of being faithful and true, which we so often forget in our eveyday lives.  Highly recomend.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|I gotta say that I was definitely surprised when I saw this movie. I mean, I was expecting something like High School Musical so I didn't think I'd even bother seeing it, but I decided, \\"What the heck, I got some time to spare...\\" and I'm glad I did! This is a family, fun, feel-good movie that leaves you feeling empowered no matter your age and it encourages everyone especially kids and teens to be confident and not be afraid to chase that dream or take a chance. It really is just so entertaining and the songs are addictive! Can't wait to get my hands on this movie!
B000023VR6|4.0|The beats are magical, and the tones are smooth and easy to groove to. This is straight gangsta rap-put this on when you're going down the highway late at night and you just want to lay low. Snoop Dogg's contributions to the album are just right. You can't help but love his style of rap, the lazy, smooth drawl. And Dr. Dre is bigger and better than ever on this album. However, Dr. Dre scarcely performs by himself on this thing. I think we all miss that. Also, some songs can be boring in the lyrics. With this being gangsta rap, most of the songs are about vodka, scams, and cruisin' down the street in a 67' Buick smoking fat Cuban cigars. The style gets old.    Overall, this album is good, but not great. If you love rap, get it . Great songs are Still D.R.E., The Next Episode, and Forgot About Dre. On his next effort, let's pray that Dr. Dre can do a little better than on this one. If all of his songs are as good as the highlights on this one, that'll be no problem!
B003UESJH4|4.0|To start with, this wasn't a film I was drawn to really.  I rented it after it won best picture and found that it actually touched on many different issues that lots of people can relate to.  Speech impediments create insecurity which in turn can result in lost opportunities and a life lived with major fear and phobia.  The film has this great cast who bring you directly into the deep emotional pain that the future king, (Colin Firth) experiences due to a life long speech impediment he cannot conquer. As a trauma therapist who regularly deals with people's emotional pain due to various childhood traumas, it was so gratifying to see that the speech therapist in the film, (Geoffrey Rush) with few credentials,  had figured out how to make such successful breakthroughs with his clients using unconventional techniques.  I love the way the director placed the camera so close to the actors so that you could get a real sense of the struggling future king experiencing his sad childhood memories AND the caring, strong face of Geoffery Rush when he attempted to reach the future king & strengthen his resolve in times of great shame and agony. Really beautiful to see how the director portrayed a grown man experiencing such painful memories and yet pushing his way past them and finding his voice.  I highly recommend the film.  Throughout my career I have witnessed some similar breakthroughs with adults who never believed they could overcome some of their issues which originated long ago.  It is very possible to overcome trauma.  Somatic Experiencing is a successful method of healing trauma and some of the things I learned to do as a clinician, were actually shown in this film. I wish more was brought out in the media about this pervasive and important subject.
B000024V8E|5.0|I love all her music CD's you can't go wrong with any of them.  Very beautiful and rare music recommed.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Seems pretty useless. Wouldn't download anything on EVO. Just sat with a searching message or something like that. Tried numerous titles with no luck on any.
B004N66XYE|2.0|Although I really, REALLY wanted to like this, it was just too fast and exaggerated to find even remotely believable.    There are three episodes.  The first episode was quite nice.  I was very touched to once again have Jean Marsh (Rose) with me.  I replayed her return to 165 Eaton Place several times just to watch her smile.  But the reverence she engenders comes not from the current story but rather from my memory of her from decades ago.  I also found the butler very endearing - a worthy replacement to Mr. Hudson.  But most of the others were just cartoons unsuccessfully designed to elicit emotional responses from the viewers.  It doesn't work.  The mute child who kept rolling symbolic marbles was a cardboard contrivance.  Agnes's annoying younger sister was way over the top.  Agnes herself was too overbearing and her mother-in-law was way too quick-witted and clever to be believable.  The all-wise Indian man with his monkey was just another glittery ornament to hang on the tree.  Speaking of tree, in the last scene it suddenly becomes winter so everybody can inexplicably come together around the Christmas tree for a happy ending.  Bizarre.
B004OBQDH0|1.0|The silly Dobby \\"bookend\\" is in no way worth a basic no frills dvd, at a premium price.  The picture quality is poor!!  There is no DTS!!!  Oh but wait all of this should be compensated with a poor bookend at a premium price!!!  Do Not Buy This!!! You will be sorely disappointed.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I loved this movie..Temlpe Grandin has Atism and the movie shows how inspite of it got her Doctors degree. also her inventnions made huge changes in the cattle industry on the handing of cows in a humane way.

She has a web site you can to do also. Highly recommend.
0756405890|3.0|I just couldn't finish it. I read about 200 pages or so, about 1/3 of the way through, and had to put it down.     While the writing has an elegant simplicity to it that is actually quite charming, the story itself is very narrow in scope, and fails to build any excitement or tension. Since the book moves forward as primarily one massive flashback from the singular perspective of an innkeeper (that the reader has very little vested interest in from the get-go, by the way), you know that anything that might or might not happen to him has very little consequence in the future, as he obviously survived to tell the tale from semi-retirement. Thus, very little tension. And sadly, the events themselves were just not that engaging. Traveling musical caravan, twelve-year-old learns stuff from an old-uncle-type that notices just how unique and special the kid is, tell his family he should attend a \\"University,\\" yes, very-Harry Potter-ish, then family gets killed, kid escapes, learns to beg and live on the mean streets, as we are repeatedly pulled though several more flashbacks-inside-the-flashback regarding people and places that don't seem to relate to either the kid or the innkeeper in any significant fashion. Granted, I didn't finish the book, but 200 pages is more than enough of a leash, in my opinion.    Also, a pet peeve of mine is when any author neglects to stick with one characters' perspective, and instead jumps in and out of multiple characters' heads to relate everyone's point-of-view all at once, without starting a new chapter or section to separate the POV's. In this book, it happens often, and sometimes within the same paragraph. In real life, you can't hear everyone's thoughts, so it's somewhat awkward to see it done on the page.    You may think that I simply have no patience, and that might be somewhat true. However, I did make it through two-thousand-plus-pages of George R.R. Martin's Fire and Ice series and loved every minute of it. Also, I just startedTerry Goodkind's \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" and it grabbed hold of me after only 35 pages.    Of course, to each their own... but this book just wasn't for me. Good luck.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Have watched this DVD several times.  It takes several viewings to absorb everything.  I really love the actors, the stories, the subtle comedy, the costumes, the authenticity.  Maggie Smith alone makes the DVD worth buying.  She's delightful.  The bonus scenes & \\"making of\\" are outstanding also.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|No complaints with this Blu Ray.  I think the moral of the series is: Life is weird... and awesome.
0307887960|1.0|A few years ago I came across the Dukan diet while I was living in France. I had about 20 lbs to lose and decided to try it out.<br />I was very dedicated, and I lost weight fast: 10 lbs in the first 3 weeks combining the diet with 1 hour of cardio 3 times per week. I went on web forums daily for support from other women on the diet. It was a miracle! Too good to be true ? Sorry, but YES. It took about another month to lose 5 more pounds, and then I became ill. My blood pressure was really low, I had no energy at all and my doctor told me that this diet was very unhealthy and suggested I stop it immediately.  Because the diet does not allow any form of sugar in the first 2 phases (which you will follow until you lose the desired weight- so depending on how much you want to lose this could take months) my body was craving it. After seeing the doctor I had a very small bowl of plain pasta without sauce or cheese. I gained weight immediately. This diet is not forgiving, you cannot cheat, not even a little, or it will show up on the scale. After a few days I began binge eating uncontrollably, my body needed the sugar and carbs. I could not stop myself and really thought that I might have an eating disorder because this was completely out of character for me. I gained back the 15 lbs I had lost and then some. The hyperphagia ended as soon as the weight was back on.<br /><br />Here's some friendly advice: eat healthy foods, eat of everything, watch your portion control, and go to the gym. There is no magical solution; if you do these things, with a little patience, you will lose weight. I managed to lose the weight again naturally. A little exercise goes a long way.<br /><br />I am not at all surprised that people who are still in the early stages of the diet are giving it positive reviews. I thought it was working fantastically for me as well in the first few weeks because I was getting results. I would love for these people to update their reviews in a few months or a year and hear what they have to say.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's unhealthy, boring, and will not provide long term weight loss.hey have to say.     Bottom line: It's unhealthy, boring, and will not provide long term weight loss.

0439023521|5.0|Well when i started reading The Hunger Games I was kind of not looking forward to it but quite frankly I was forced to read it by my friend and she just love them.  The plot kind of didn't appeal to me I was kind of disturbed by it.  But little did i know I was addicted.  I just read and read and read I have never read a book that size in a day then. After it i pondered it for a while on whether to spend 19 dollars on the second one but there was no doubt I had to buy it.  Suzanne Collins is a brilliant and talented author I hop she comes out with a fourth.  I have not read the third yet but am waiting on its arrival.  But even with out a shadow of a doubt I would recommend this to every one  age appropriate because its not horrible but it is graphic.
030746363X|4.0|For the most part I bought this book for the reason I think most people do, to loose some weight. Although if I remain happy with it I intend to use some of the other parts. My biggest negative about the book would be Tim doesn't seem to be very into food, he doesn't really much cook for himself, and thus he doesn't give a big list of foods that are good for the diet. Also he is convinced that eating the same meals many times keeps you from breaking it. I disagree. However, wile I write this drinking my morning protein shake I have lost more than 10 lbs. in less than a month. I also spent the previous day eating a tray of baklava, meatloaf and mash potatoes, peking duck, and an assortment of Easter candy wile gaining back little over a 1 lb.
0553381695|2.0|I loved A Game of Thrones and thought it was a fairly non-stop, action packed book with brilliants twists and turns and plenty of action. Everything that A Game of Thrones is, A Clash of Kings is not.    The book is built upon the premise that the entire realm is falling apart. Lords are splintering away from the Kingdom in an attempt to claim the throne for themselves, and everyone is at odds against each other. Sounds like a great premise, right?    The problem is that, while we know Martin can craft well written action scenes as seen in the first book, he really refuses to do so in the second. What we're left with is characters talking about battles, discussing past battles, crafting future battle plans, but for some reason Martin never actually let's us see them. He has characters tells us about plots to free prisoners in the middle of the night that result in bloody scuffles, but we don't get to see them. He has other characters tell us about the sacking of cities, but again we won't see any of this until the very end.    I had to put the book down. I got so exhausted from having characters stand around and tell me what was happening in book rather than having Martin write it out that it just felt tedious and slow. If you enjoyed A Game of Thrones, prepare yourself for the second book in the series to be an unfortunately much slower, duller ride than the first.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|With the fifth pairing of actor Denzil Washington and director Tony Scott, this film is a blockbuster in terms of quality and action.  What's more the pairing of Washington and newcomer Chris Pine, fresh from his \\"Star Trek\\" stint as the young Captain Kirk, provides some sparks in this already suspense film inspired by a true incident.  The supporting cast is fine also with Rosario Dawson fine as the train company's superintendant, and Kevin Dunn as the CEO eager to save face at the expense of equipment and lives. I saw this film in a good theater with DTS sound and the same holds true for the Blu-ray edition of the best action film of 2010!  If you want a demo disc to show off your home theater system, you can't go wrong with this film or the latest \\"Star Trek\\" reboot by J.J. Abrams.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've been thoroughly impressed by this app, which improves on the stock calendar in several ways. Before getting this app, I tried searching for a set of related events (my son's baseball games) on the stock calendar. It failed to list them in chronological order, and it also missed one of the events. This calendar, on the other hand, found them all and listed them chronologically. I also love being able to click on a day when in month view to see a popup for that day. A very well constructed app.

B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|I'm a wedding photographer and i was looking for a solution to changing out my flash batteries so often. I found a great solution with this extended battery pack for the flash. First, this is a Canon product so you know it is built really well. I have no complaints on the build quality and being it is Canon anyway, no one should be worrying about the products quality. I have noticed that this battery pack has probably cut my battery swaps in half during weddings. It figures given that you put about 8 batteries in this unit and 4 in your flash. This will save you the frustration of having to swap out batteries or worrying if you will have to swap out batteries at an inopportune time. For reference, i am using this on a Canon 5D Mark II and a Canon 580EX II Speedlite.    Buy this and you will not regret it!
B000683VI4|4.0|I bought this for my wife for Valentine's Day, its exactly what you would expect, gay and sappy, but I guess it was a good movie.  Even if you're a dude expect to get a little choked up at the end
1400052181|5.0|Rebecc Sloot proved to be a highly dedicated writer-investigator while researching an interesting story about a young black ladt who succombed to cancer in 1951  The story did not stop with her death, but continued until the first decade of the 21st Centry, due to the fact that cells from her body were able to reproduce after removal and be used by medical researchers world wide - a rare and significant occurence of science.  Sloot's research required lengthy efforts to put together how the scientific community used these cells for important tests such as confirming polio immunization numerous other medical research for years. The story became interesting as Henrietta's family sought vainly to be compensated for the use of her cells, because they believed that the reporduced cells were actually her body, and thus the author titled her book about Immortal Henrietta.
0307477479|2.0|This is an OK book, maybe even 3-stars OK.    I go 2 and a half on it. I'm partially through and looking forward to 75 pages or so of powerpoints so I don't have to go through the multiple-personality disorder prose.    Entertaining-yes  Moments of humanity revealed-yes    Deserving to be in the same class with Toni Morrison, Junot Diaz, Edward P. Jones? Absolutely not.    C'mon Pulitzer committee----you can't really think this was the best work of fiction produced this year. I demand a recount, hanging chads and all.
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie was bought for a gift and request by my grandchildren for Easter.  It has a couple of spots which Disney could have left out but they loved  the movie. Thank you Amazon for offering it for a great price.
B004J713JW|5.0|This DVD has been put together very well. Billy Joel's Concert was worth the price. Great songs.  I have my system hooked up to my sterio system and 4 speakers stacked. Great visual concert for friends   over to enjoy.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Not even Portman can save this degenerated fiasco, all this movie revolves around is a young ballerina that has compulsive scratching and eating disorders with a touch of obssesive masturbation with hallucinations........yeah. If you're brainless enough to swallow this mess(I know the MAIN CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE WOULD! BAD JOKE)then you deserve to waste your money. I bought it for $10 and sold it for $15, so that's why I give 5 stars!
0385342055|2.0|I adored every single bit of Sophie Kinsella's work...until I read this book. Every time a Shopaholic book ends, I feel slightly disappointed that Becky hasn't changed but I'm charmed enough by her character to get past that. This time, I couldn't even get all the way through the book - and that has NEVER happened with a Sophie Kinsella read before.<br /><br />It was so disheartening to witness cute little infant Minnie transform into a complete nightmare between the 5th and 6th books. There was nothing even remotely redeeming or cute about the two-year-old because we only see her in her worst moments (or she only has worst moments!). I love babies. Couldn't she have made this one even slightly endearing?<br /><br />In fact, wouldn't it have been more interesting to see a child who was more sensible about shopping than her mother? She could have taken after Luke's side more. Maybe baby Minnie could have reigned her mother in and provided an extra balance to the family. Or at least give a hilarious contrast between a lunatic mom and a child who has more sense. I was especially disappointed to see that Luke was so swept up in his business that he allowed his daughter to become this nightmare of a toddler in the first place. I expected more of him as a parent.<br /><br />The last possible save would have been to have Elinor tame Minnie and be the change their daughter needs; Luke could have come around and reconciled with her. But no, instead of making it about the relationships and change of character, it became about throwing some stupid party in the middle of a freakin' recession! Minnie didn't change at all! And yes they got their party, but the \\"payoff\\" wasn't worth suffering through more than 300 pages of Becky's antics and Minnie's foul behavior.<br /><br />Becky has always been a bit of an airhead but she was always a lovable, fun one. Now, she's a selfish, vapid, conceited, completely shallow, horrible excuse of a mother, wife, daughter, and friend. She LIES to everyone and then has the nerve to snap at them throughout the book. At least in previous books, she would acknowledge her faults but now she places the blame on those around her and doesn't own up to anything - even the spoiling of her only child. What the hell is her problem? Even Luke got on my nerves. The only endearing part of the book was when he tells Becky she's perfect and would never need any surgery. We get a glimpse of the old Luke. But for the most part, he's a removed, irritable, sarcastic jerk for much of the book.<br /><br />I honestly wish Sophie Kinsella ended the series with Shopaholic and Baby because she has now tainted the entire series with this monstrosity of a read. No quite sure I'll be reading the next installment.rve to snap at them throughout the book.

B004KPLVV8|4.0|If you can try to believe it, there was a time when computers considered untouchable to the average person in this world. No one would have ever expected that these wondrous thinking machines would be a staple of the common house hold let alone be used for anything else than simple game programs. Suddenly in the early 1980s a film was announced and it was to be the first that ever delved into the concept that computers could be use to help make films through its own style of animation. That movie was Tron.<br />Tron is a simple story starring the great Jeff Bridges who hacks his way into his old company's computer data base to retrieve evidence that ideas for successful computer games belonged him and not the man who forced him to leave. Little did he know that a program known as Master Control had been growing and hacking its own way into other databases to become the greatest most powerful program ever. Machines thinking on their own?! ,Who would have thought?! So the computer universe is given a visit from \\"The Dude\\" and a cult hit is born.<br /><br />This film for what it was for its time in incredible. I am blown away by what creative minds felt would be the next generation of film making. Mind you if you were born after 1996 you probably will not understand this film nor will you even believe that there was a time when computers that you see in Tron were considered `Advanced.' This film is not only a great ride, but it is a historical trip in understanding the pioneering of computer technology and how we got to where we are today. The plot is a little hard to get at times and the movie does move a bit slow. Still, Tron is a classic and a true wonder to behold
1400052181|5.0|Hint: Don't pick up this book until you can devote eight to 12 hours to it.  It's one of those read-all-night, can't-put-it-down reading experiences. (I started it around midnight and just finished at 9 a.m.)<br /><br />I appreciate that this was a tale not just of Ms. Lacks, but of her family and the author as well, with fascinating excursions into the world of science and the often unfortunate sociology of the twentieth century. I found the family engrossingly human, presented with all their beauty and warts and in their own voices.  There are heroes and villains among the scientists, legal system, and unrequited gene and tissue donors, plus the suspense of a good mystery--how will this or that situation work out? What will happen to this or that character? Hence the all night reading. I love that in a book. Decades of events braided together like a good hair weave, too. Wow. Highly recommended!
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I was always hearing rumors that a Tron sequel was in the works and we finally got in Tron Legacy.<br /><br />After waiting nearly over 30 years Tron returns to the movie going public like never before. Revolving around Flynns son Sam this movie pays a true tribute to its 1982 predecessor, by bringing back the same actors that made it big in the first place. Also, by attempting to push the bar in computer technology. The most amazing thing I saw in this movie was the ability to stick Jeff Bridges' head on a younger body to re-create a younger version of himself. Also all of the action sequences are amazing and the whole movie itself shows you just how much more advance the world of computers has become since the first movie. Even by paying tribute to some of the games that were played in the first film. It showed us that even those simple games got even more complex how things weren't just cubes and strait lines anymore. The computer world has evolved so much and so fast it has practically caught up with the real world itself. That makes the stakes much higher for our heros. What I also took from Tron Legacy is that we will never be perfect, we are always going to be discovering new things at every turn and just because they may not always keep us in our comfort zone we need to try and move forward and see what the future will bring to us.<br /><br />Acting wise the movie isn't at its strongest and like the first one it does have a few dead spots. Still Jeff Bridges is awesome and I was blown away that they managed to bring Bruce Boxlightner back into the spotlight and it seems like he now has some new projects in the works for his career.<br /><br />Tron Legacy, while it is not perfect, I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who wants to see something new.(but you gotta see the first one first) The best part about this movie was the soundtrack, Daft Punk drives this movie from beginning to end and even if you end up hating this movie you will still love the soundtrack. Now, there is an animated series premering this fall and there are talks of a third installment I am very curious to see where we will go next in the world of Tron.s an animated series premering this fall and there are talks of a third installment I am very curious to see where we will go next in the world of Tron.
B000K7UG34|5.0|We Were Soldiers is one of those movies that tells a story.  A true story.  A touching and eye opening story.  A story of sacrifice, duty, honor, courage, and most importantly trust and companionship.  At times the ONLY thing these guys had was each other.  This movie does an excellent job at portraying that.    These men are part of the Air Cavalry.  A new division that traded in their horses for choppers.  You really see how hard their job was.  Just think about it.  You're put on a chopper and flown many miles behind enemy lines.  Then you're dropped in a field and told to hold it and wait for reinforcements, which will take about an hour.  You don't know if your position will be overrun and what's worse is you don't know how many enemies you're facing.  It could be 5 guys in a trench or 5,000 in underground tunnels.  And I'll go ahead and tell you, in this movie, it's the later.    Mel Gibson does an excellent job commanding his men.  He cares for them and this forms a bond that is unbreakable.  In fact many of the actors do great jobs.    The blu-ray version is great.  I really noticed the deep colors in the explosions.  The sound seems more clear and vibrant too.  It really brings the fight to life.  And for this price, it's well worth it.
B004V5QWU2|4.0|My 5 yr old and I enjoy this app. The option to combine up to 3 different sounds is very nice. I will give 5 stars if they add an option to adjust the individual volumes for each of the 3 choices.  The windchimes would sound better to me if they sounded softer, but lowering the volume also lowers the wind sound and makes that hard to hear.  If there was a SAVE option for a few favorite combinations that would be very helpful too. It is a nice and simple  app.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|\\"Wasting Light\\" is an interesting phenomenon. It is the band's first number one album. Butch Vig (Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Garbage) produces along with Alan Moulder (Nine Inch Nails) behind the controls. Pat Smear appears for the first time since 1997's \\"The Colour And The Shape\\". Sure fire success. Then there are the critical reviews about how the album was recorded in a garage, and how tight the band sounds. Then there's Grohl himself saying that \\"Wasting Light\\" is the heaviest album the band has made.<br /><br />I listened to all of the Foo Fighters albums in sequential order leading up to \\"Wasting Light\\" so that their previous work would be fresh in my mind as I listened to their new album. I liked \\"Wasting Light\\", just like I liked all of the band's albums. Some might say that \\"Wasting Light\\" is five stars, but I say it's four. Each Foo Fighters album has some filler, and wasting light is no different. If you are listening to the entire album in one shot like I did all week long, somewhere around \\"Back & Forth\\" the album falters and only really recovers on \\"Walk\\". \\"Back & Forth\\", \\"A Matter Of Time\\", \\"Miss The Misery\\" and \\"I Should Have Known\\" are fine, but they are not as good as the rest of the tracks.<br /><br />In fact, first single \\"Rope\\", \\"Dear Rosemary\\", \\"Arlandria\\", \\"These Days\\" and \\"Walk\\" could easily top the modern rock and top 40 charts. They have strong, melodic hard rock hooks and good lyrics. I also liked \\"Bridge Burning\\" and the screaming Motorhead-like \\"White Limo\\".<br /><br />So, you might be wondering at this point how \\"Wasting Light\\" compares to the Foo Fighters other work? In this case, I surprised myself in changing my mind about \\"The Colour And The Shape\\" which, for many years, I felt was the band's best work. But after listening to everything again I felt \\"One By One\\" to be their best work. It's their one album that, track by track, has very little filler.<br /><br />I am somewhat surprised how much praise has been given to \\"Wasting Light\\" and how popular the Foo Fighters have become. I mean, I remember in 1995 when I saw the cheap video for \\"This Is A Call\\" and thought what is Dave Grohl doing? I really thought at that time that Foo Fighters were going to be a passing phase. I certainly never thought they would become a mainstream popular rock band selling millions of copies and obtaining a number one album. What's more, is the band is more popular 16 years into their career than they were in 1995. That's no small feat, Dave Grohl has proven he and the band have staying power. They are one of the few hard rock bands that actually interest me. Too much of the genre has turned into whiny, moany bland guitar crunch a la Creed, or annoying pop rock like Fall Out Boy.<br /><br />Here is how \\"Wasting Light\\" compares to the Foo Fighters previous works:<br /><br />1995 Foo Fighters: Three and a Half Stars<br />1997 The Colour And The Shape: Four Stars<br />1999 There Is Nothing Left To Lose: Four and a Half Stars<br />2002 One By One: Five Stars<br />2005 In You Honor: Four Stars<br />2007 Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace: Three and a Half Stars<br />2011 Wasting Light: Four Starsters have become.

B004G600A4|5.0|My fiancee and I went to see this in theatres. We haven't laughed that hard in ages at a movie. This was so sweet, loving and totally original. We bought it the day it came out.
0307474275|5.0|Fun to read!  A work of fiction that created enough intrigue to make me look up some facts.  The writer was able to really paint a visual image.  Fast paced and full of conspiracy theories - very entertaining!
0545123275|1.0|I've had this book on my to-read list since it first came out with rave reviews.  I never really picked up on the fact that it was about (were)wolves.  That right there should have been my first hint of distaste.  Everything in the YA literary world now seems to be compared to Twilight, which did seem to relaunch the \\"paranormal romance\\" genre, and I hate to go back to that old trope, but let me just say that while the writing was arguably better than Stephenie Meyer's, Maggie Stiefvater's Grace and Sam made Bella and Edward's relationship seem safe.  Other reviewers have pointed out that the writing was overly descriptive, and I do agree with them on that point.  The story took a very long time to get to a point (this seems to be a Thing nowadays.  Why are so many authors gravitating towards writing trilogies and unnecessarily stretching stories thin?) and once it did, the explanations were lacking.  Like I'd mentioned, the romance was creepy.  We've gone from Edward Cullen watching a girl sleep, to Sam Roth watching a girl change, without her knowledge of his presence.  Classy.  Way to give the YA genre a bad name.  There is a line between a healthy relationship and obsession, and this line was crossed.  There's not an interesting cast of supporting characters to hold up the over-romanticized wolfboy adventures either, leaving the entire book rather flat.  I was not impressed and will be skipping the sequels.<br /><br />Rating: 1/5
B004EC5IV6|5.0|This is an anime revamp of the old evangellion series.  They have cut alot of the semi insane plot and improved the fight scenes with the eva battles.  They added a new character to provide a better balance in overall plot and character improvement to the story.  I have the old series and compared to these, they are headed in a better direction.  I am eager for the next episode to come out.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|When I first heard and read about 'The Clone Wars TV', I thought 'what's next?!  I mean is this really necessary?  Isn't Star Wars finished?  I thought the Clone Wars movie was OK, but not great and definately not needed.  But the TV show is much better than the movie, really great star wars in the style of the 3 originals: quick pace, lots of space battles, good stories, and excellent visuals.      I consider the clone wars movie to be a practice session for the TV series.  I'm happy this show is being made and I am enjoying Star Wars as much as ever.      I notice the reviews for the blu-ray and DVD are are mixed together.  I am watching the DVD on an upconverting DVD player on a 32 inch 720p screen and it looks fabulous!  A very clean and sharp image if you don't have blu-ray.  The animation is very smooth and fluid and the backgrounds are pure Star Wars.  I read complants about the character's appearence, but I think they look good.  I always focus on the eyes and these are well done with lots of subtle movement in the eyes and eye lids.  I like this effect more than movies like Final Fantasy that try to be photo-realistic but seem to have the fixed stare look much of the time.
B00000DOZH|5.0|This album is kick a$$ from beginning to end. It's my favorite AC/DC album because it rules. I don't know about you guys, but the Brian Johnson stuff just doesn't cut it. You can really feel the energy radiating from the band especially when you listen to it on a good system or a good pair of headphones. Whatever you do, DO NOT get the 2003 remaster. It is awful! The dynamic range is gone, and everything is at the same volume. Bah it sounds hideous. Get the 1990 CD pressing if you can or better yet, get it on vinyl. This album has far more going for it than the title track.
B001GQSY5K|3.0|I recently watched all 6 episodes of Star Wars back to back over a 3 day period and I enjoyed them all very much.  By watching them in sequence, it saves the best (the originals) for last.  So I decided to go ahead and buy the Clone Wars movie and season 1.  This CGI animated movie seems like a cross between the dry episodes 1 & 2 and the later more relaxed, and better, final episodes.  So I say its good, but not great.  The animation style takes a few minutes to get used to, but it well done with fluid movements and action.      This movie is best seen as an introduction to the TV series, as others have noted.  I started watching TV season 1 the same day as I watched the movie and, wow, now we're talking!  The TV season 1 is awesome!  Fast past, good stories, lots of action, good dialogue, and I think the animation has been tweeked a bit to give it a better overall look than the Clone Wars movie.  I think it may be the use of light and shawdow effects, something looks a better.  If your going to get the TV series, get this as a 'prequel' - 'nuf said.
B004G600A4|5.0|My 7 yr old and 3 1/2 yr old both love this movie!  IT is great for adults as well.

B001MWBK4U|5.0|Epic in proportions. Historically accurate and a masterpiece!!  One of the best movies of all time.  The Academy Award winning film editor, Walter Murch was the first to use digital editing for Cold Mountain.  It earned him another golden statue. Movies are made great by film editors and Murch is the master of it.  Sgt Bob says this movie is worthy for your video library.  Awesome performances by all actors.  Not for children!!
B000NU2CY4|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever produced.  Excellent Cinematography, Directing, Editing, and last but not least, acting!  A subpurb performance by Crowe.  Epic in every way.

0312600844|4.0|I decided to read Freedom after hearing some people praise Franzen as America's greatest living novelist or decry him for being overrated. After reading both Freedom and The Corrections, I ended up enjoying his writing. If you love books with likable main characters, you should probably stay away from Freedom. That being said, I found it amazing that Franzen led me to sympathize with some of the characters. My only complaint against the book is that the ending seemed a little tacked on, but the first few hundred pages were incredible and hooked me in. While I did not find the novel to be the defining work of our time, it was undoubtedly worth the time I put into it.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|This book started off okay, went on & on about the same types of things, got good about 2/3 in then fizzled out towards the end. The premise of the story is good, an unimaginable life, but this book was just okay for me.
B003UYUR10|5.0|Only a few movies are this entertaining.      It didn't take much acting to top Jakes previous movies.   AWESOME!    I bought the Blue ray/dvd/digital copy.  These deals work great when you have blue ray in the master sweet and dvd in the living room. Digital copy for kids? haha
B0041KKYD8|5.0|No wonder this wasnt shown on the theatres, it's just simply disturbing and gruesome, im sure this was banned in other countries, i have really enjoyed it 100 times better than the original, go buy it, it's all worth it, too brutal sometimes it's difficult to watch, if you are not a fan of this genre, better watch something else, i couldnt believe negative reviews made by others, trust me this is not a 'Toy Story' movie, i only make one or two reviews in a year, and this one really caught my attention... 10 stars!!!
B003L20IFQ|5.0|The Movie is just like a bad dream that you can't wake up from.. and the director really begins to escalate the crisis of being trapped in a box 6 feet under when the sand pours in. I'm still having brain damage from watching it. Do not watch this film if you a guy who might scream.    I thought the guy was lucky not to be buried in sand for the first hour. He went crazy kicking and screaming in the box and trying to push the lid off and I said ut oh, what if that....Shzzz.      He was a one man show. There was no need to see other actors. The whole story is putting yourself in his shoes.      If the movie more re watchable? No.
B004RUF9DC|5.0|This dvd is a great product. The bluray quality is good<br />While JEFFREY HUNTER in KING OF KINGS,plays a better christ.<br />This film starring the great swedish actor MAX VON SYDOW.<br />Has more detail celebrity cameos,and more story lines<br />[ such as christ bringing back LAZEROUS ,from the dead as an example.<br />MARTIN LANDAU plays a great chaiephus, the cheif pharise.[please<br />excuse my spelling].
0307269752|5.0|This review contains NO SPOILERS.  I can't wait to read the other two books in the series.  The book starts off a little slow but once it picks up, it's a non-stop thrill ride.  Crime, deceit, greed,lust and revenge are all thrown together to make a very intriguing story.  The main characters are easy to like and Larsson does an excellent job providing enough background information to help you identify with them.  This is the best book I've read in 2011.
B001FB563E|4.0|The Road is a hard movie to recommend to people. It's an end of the world drama, 95% of the movie focuses on two characters, and there's not much action. This was a movie that I was really looking forward to back when the release date was constantly being pushed back, and now that I've seen it, I still can't decide if it's just plain ok or if it's pretty good. Fans of post-apocalypse movies might want to go elsewhere if they want action or something unique (in those cases, I'd recommend The Book of Eli or A Boy and His Dog, both are great especially if you're a fan of Fallout 3).    The movie focuses on a father and son, who we never learn the names of, as they try to survive and travel south, per the mother's request before she abandoned them to die alone in the cold of night. Some kind of cataclysmic event took place, and we never find out what exactly happened, but it devastated the world, leaving everything in ruins, trees dead, killed all the animals, and caused a lot of fires. As a result, it's survival of the fittest. Gangs of cannibals, usually with guns, travel the roads looking for victims to rob and do horrible things to before killing and eating them. As you can tell, life basically sucks for everyone. The father loves his son with all his heart, and he's the one factor in life that keeps him going. The father has a single revolver with two bullets, one for him and one for his son. He even shows his son how to put the gun in his mouth and end it all if he's in a horrible situation or just plain wants to end it all. But after a close call with a cannibal, one of the bullets is used, and that leaves one left. No one can be trusted in this world, as even people who normally wouldn't be much hassle can be a big threat to a man who has nothing left to lose but his son.    What I loved most about The Road was how perfect they got the 'end of the world' look. Absolutely everything is in shambles, and at the same time, they don't beat you over the head with thefact that life is tough here. We see how hard it is to find food when the dad is collecting crumbs off deserted restaurant tables, or when he turns finding a can of Coca Cola into a special occasion for his son, who'd never seen one before. Just like in The Book of Eli, they did a good job of showing just how precious things we do or use on an everyday basis are in a situation like this. When the man and boy make it to a house that has a bath tub and scissors to cut their hair, you'd think that it was Christmas. Scenes like this are beautiful, and as a parent, I got more out of them than people without kids might, especially the scene where the dad is reading to his son and showing him pictures of animals that the boy would never see. Little scenes like the boy admiring a deer head mounted on a wall got to me, since it's so tough to imagine someone having never seen a common deer before, and how special that would be for them. The father also carries his son a lot of times, and while many people saw this as annoying, you have to understand just how protective he is of his son. The guy has ONE bullet in a little revolver, and many of the raiders/cannibals they see have high powered rifles or shotguns. Of course he's not going to let his son trail behind him unless it's -very- safe! I also have to hand it to Robert Duvall here for giving a touching performance, and for being so unrecognizable as a lone wanderer.    But my problems are with how the movie goes- not a whole lot happens. As touching as it was to see a father and son survive and get happiness out of things like finding good food or sleeping in a bed instead of on rocks, you could easily summarize what happens in this movie by talking about the world they're in, and then how it ends. The whole middle of the movie is them traveling, with some flashbacks of life before everything went down. There are just 2 or 3 truly big threats that come their way, with one of them being extremely intense, but I personallythink they could've been stretched out a little more. And the ending left a bit to be desired. While it doesn't quite lack a 'real ending', I wished that there would've been better closure, and I still felt unsure about the choice that was made by x character (I won't say who).    The blu-ray doesn't have much to offer over the dvd. Picture and audio quality are both above average, and the edge ringing artifacts were very noticeable. The film was shot with an intentional muted, grainy look to set the mood, so don't go expecting this to look crystal clear. There's a fairly good DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack, but there's not much point in having such strong audio for a movie where the audio is mostly dialogue. Special features were pretty skimpy too, with just a standard making-of featurette, commentary with the director (who even says himself that he's winging it), deleted/extended scenes and two trailers that show how poorly they handled marketing. Watch these after the movie and you'll have a laugh. Of all the info I got from the special features, my favorite was a story about how they had to keep shooting the Coke scene with different drinks in case Coca Cola didn't approve of them using their product in the movie. It got to the point where Viggo finally asked if Coca Cola said anything, and it turned out that no one actually called them, so he did it himself and got full approval.    If I could, I'd give the blu-ray a 3.5 rating, but I'll bump it up if only because I loved the visuals so much and the performances by Viggo and Kodi. The Road isn't a great film by any means, but it's definitely not bad. Maybe with a couple more viewings it'll grow on me, but we'll see. At the very least, give this one a rent.
0307476154|5.0|Way better then the first. It just keeps getting better and better. Stieg let us get to know Salander even more. This one was filled with ups and downs, and thrills and rides, all over again and again, and again.  They threw me for a loop with this story here. You will never ever ever guess what happened and why Salander ticks.<br /><br />Perfect for a whodunit story to. Follow the trails getting lost in the mists of something real, and suspenseful with small elements of GLBT. (Maybe a little more then expected).<br /><br />Action packed, and spine tingling, Whoa did that just happened kick ass moves... lol.
B00466HN6I|2.0|This movie is about a government agent who must race against the clock to prevent a terrorist attack in Chicago. The plot is tense and imaginative, the acting and casting are almost uniformly excellent, and the film looks gorgeous. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Monaghan is charming and the conclusion is very emotionally satisfying. Source Code could have been a fantastic movie except for one thing: the plot contains so many ridiculous logical absurdities that if you recognize them you might be too annoyed to enjoy the film. If you are curious about the logical incongruities and don't mind spoiling the plot, read on, but I must warn you that there is no turning back once you have taken the red pill. Your blissful ignorance will be lost and replaced with the recognition of how hilariously nonsensical this movie really is.    *** SPOILER ALERT ***    The premise, gradually revealed, is that a massive train bombing has taken place in Chicago and the terrorist has given advance notice that he will detonate a radioactive \\"dirty bomb\\" next. A secret government program is able to \\"read\\" the final memories of the train bombing victims from their deceased brains by scanning the residual electrical charges in their brains. Please ignore the fact that those brains would have been reduced to ash and scattered over the charred wreckage of the bombing.    Using the memories of the bombing victims, the government mad scientists are able to construct a virtual reality simulation of the eight minutes leading up to the bombing, under the name of project Source Code. The biggest absurdity is that not only are they able to reconstruct what happened, but they are able to simulate what would have happened under entirely different histories. Not only that, but they can simulate the world outside the train, to the point of simulating that the second bomb was hidden in a van parked at a specific location in Chicago. Unfortunately, although the designers of this magical computer simulator can simulate the exact location and design of the second bomb, they have no way of asking their simulator where that might be. In fact, the simulator cannot tell them anything at all. They must resort to sending comatose individuals inside the simulation by attaching their brains to the computer, as in \\"The Matrix.\\" They can then switch the brains over to a different simulation in which the comatose operatives can suddenly communicate with the real world by having their thoughts read, using a teleconferencing system inside the virtual reality. All of this is possible thanks to technological breakthroughs based on \\"quantum mechanics and parabolic calculus\\" (no joke). Perhaps a more plausible plot device would be that the main character is really a robot with psychic powers, who travels back through time to fight crime.    The crime-fighting operative in this case is a comatose military pilot named Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal). Stevens must identify the terrorist on the train so that his real-life counterpart can be stopped from detonating the second bomb, and every time the eight minutes runs out, he returns to the teleconferencing room to brief his real-world military handler, Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), before being sent back in to try again. A complicating factor is that the other passengers see him as a passenger whom he replaced, a teacher named Sean Fentress, including Fentress's love interest Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan).    As you would expect, Stevens locates the terrorist and stops both bombs after several attempts. This is possible due to a series of lucky coincidences and implausible mistakes by the terrorist. This allows project Source Code to locate and arrest the real-life terrorist as he is driving around in a van with the radioactive bomb. For some reason, the arrest is broadcast live on national television, just like other top-secret anti-terrorist operations. This would make for a bittersweet ending, since the victims of the first bombing are still dead, so the writer opts for an enormous deux ex machina instead. We see that the virtual simulation has turned into some kind of parallel universe where Stevens can go on living as Sean Fentress, whereas \\"reality\\" has turned into a different parallel universe where both bombings were prevented by other means. Maybe they were alternate universes all along? Goodwin even receives an inter-universal text message from Stevens about how their non-existent plan to stop the first bombing must have worked. The movie ends with Stevens impersonating Fentress to go on a date with Warren inside the computer-simulation-turned-parallel-universe. The End.  ---------------
B004G6009U|4.0|Tangled is GREAT!  It very well written and fun.  It's been a while since Disney has had a real winner and this will be enjoyed by children and adults alike.  The animation is more in line with recent animated features and less like a Disney movie.  This movie is definitely worth a look.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|I've had two other Zagg covers on cameras that held up well and protected my lcd screens but the iphone cover is not a very good. The front cover wouldn't even go on smoothly; I tried a couple times and could never get the bubbles/blemishes out. The back cover went on nicely and looked good for about a week before it started to peel away. I eventually just tore it off and tossed it. I may have to get one of the bulky phone covers or try a different brand.
1439107955|3.0|I will wait for the paperback.  The online excerpt showed your typical breezy autobiography with history thrown in for balance.  No traditional numbered footnotes.  The book has caught the public's imagination so it's overpriced.  But in a few years it should be selling for $1.99 plus shipping, and that's the time to read this eminently forgettable secondary and tertiary source book.
B004SKJIEC|4.0|i pledge i am not being compensated for this review.  On disc 1 i compared \\"Pastime Paradise\\" with the 2000 Motown remaster.  Unlike other reviewers, i appreciate some \\"air\\" in the Motown remasters for the sense of proximity it creates.  However, i like the way this gold disc clarifies the mid range, ungarbles the high end, and provides \\"bap\\" in the low end.  If you want a real treat, compare the versions of \\"I Wish\\".  It will make you wonder what is wrong with the tapes Motown used 11 years ago.  On disc 2 i compared \\"I Am Singing\\" and found similar results.  To me, the soundstage (if i'm using that term correctly) is too snug and tight on all the Audio Fidelity Wonder issues.  They could be spread out some more, but i don't know if that's possible without re-mixing, and that runs into money, as Chico Marx once said.

0143034901|2.0|Slow, pointless, unnecessarily complex vocabulary - seemed the author aimed to impress if not by story then by his amazing vocabulary and turn of phrase.  For those that like writing for writings sake, this book is great, sip your wine, and enjoy. For those that want a good yarn that grips, squeezes, and maybe leaves a little juice worth drinking in reflection when its all over, this isn't it. The only driving force in this story for me was will power to finish, and the hope that such great writing skill must come with a worthy point by the end of the novel.<br /><br />People that like writing for the sake of clever pros and witty dialog may love this book. In fact, it was emphatically recommended to me by just such a person.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|Pros: 1.I use this pedal for playing at church a few times a month and practicing.  It's more than adequate for that. 2. I don't notice any change in the sound from my guitar when i use this pedal, which is key for me. 3. It seems to be pretty precise.  4. You can buy 2 or 3 of these for less than cost of the high end tuners.     Cons : 1. it requires a pretty strong signal to pick up the low E string- if i turn my preamp down (from acoustic guitar) very much, it won't pick up the low E.  With a strong signal it has no problem.  2. The battery compartment is kind of weird, but not terrible, just read the instructions before tearing it up to try to put a battery in it.  3.  The case is plastic.     I would definitely recommend it for someone who is going to use it in a similar way to myself.  I don't know how it would hold up to a more grueling regimen.
0439023521|5.0|I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did.  I ended up reading all three books in a weeks time.  I just couldn't put it down.  I loved the reluctant heroine who is forced to step outside herself in order to defend those she loves most.  It was bloodier and considerably more violent than I am used to or perfer.  But the story was addictive and insiteful into our own societies flaws in our love for our own reality television.  Great read.
0345522478|4.0|Atticus O'Sullivan is a druid living in 21st Century America.  He's the last one, as far as he can tell, and given that he looks like a local college student, he doesn't look like a Druid to nearly everyone. You would think that the treeless desert of Tempe, Arizona, would be the perfect place for a Druid to keep far away from the Tuatha De Danaan  he has been long on the run from, but unfortunately for Atticus, trouble has rolled up to his doorstep. A Celtic god wants back the sword Atticus has had long held possession of, and is prepared to go great lengths to get it. Indeed, the angry god is prepared to go to greater lengths that Atticus at first suspects or even imagines.Other Celtic gods and goddesses have figured out where the long-hiding druid is, too, and they have their own mysterious agendas and plans for Atticus. Throw in a local witches' coven, a werewolf pack, a mysterious bartender at his favorite Fish and chips pub, his intelligent wolfhound, and a bloodsucking lawyer who is a vampire, and you quickly get the sense that Atticus' outwardly quiet life running a new age shop is far from quiet, or ordinary.<br /><br />Hounded is a debut novel from Kevin Hearne, telling the story of Atticus O'Sullivan in a wisecracking, hip first person narrative that crackles with energy, style and voice.  Despite being 21 centuries old, Atticus comes across as a modern American, with an endless stream of pop culture references in thought and speech.  He does show a variety of sides, giving an older, more nuanced mien to his supernatural friends, and a tuned into the modern world vibe to the wider world.  I think the modern world voice is somewhat stronger in the narrative than the ancient druid patterns of thought and speech. Atticus, unlike many quasi-immortals in fantasy fiction, has found the secret to not being stuck in old ways of thinking and doing things.  It is ironic, then, that his failure to understand an aspect of the modern world, the Internet, is the impetus for the plot.<br /><br />Hearne is mining classic Urban Fantasy tropes in Hounded, with a protagonist who pretends to be normal, with a mundane existence, while all the time living and interacting with a supernatural world that most mortals do not see or suspect exists. Given the mythological sheen to the supernatural elements in the book, I was strongly reminded of the Role playing game Scion, where the children of various mythological pantheons deal with hidden supernatural threats in the modern world.<br /><br />Another strong character besides Atticus himself is the milieu Hounded takes place in. The author lives in, and clearly loves Tempe, Arizona, and the book and Atticus himself reflect that loving detail. I was surprised at first, but bought into the idea that a green-loving druid could come to appreciate the stark desert of his adopted home. From the author's favorite pub, to the mountains and parks around Tempe, the Arizona city and the terrain around it made an impression on me, the reader. I appreciate when a novelist invokes a city effectively enough for me to want to visit it sometime just to see some of the places brought to life by his words.<br /><br />The action scenes in the novel work well, and the protagonist makes it clear that fighting to win, sometimes dirty, is the only rational approach to combat. I never felt that the often short and brutal fights had any \\"flynning\\" to pad the flow of the fights.  These combats also do show that tangling in such fighting have consequences.<br /><br />Given that there are a plethora of supernatural beings in the book, you will not be surprised to learn that there are a number of magic systems at work in the book, including the protagonist's novel and unusual ability to handle the otherwise magic-eating cold iron.  While the novel makes it clear that he has spent centuries learning and honing this difficult and unique magic, I didn't quite get the sense of what this knowledge cost him to perfect.  Given how powerful and important it is to his survival, and given that classic enmity between magic and cold iron, a little more explication of how he managed the feat of using in enchantment was something I would have liked to know more about.<br /><br />Overall, I think Hounded is an above average novel debut. Urban Fantasy is a crowded field these days, with a lot of interchangeable heroes and heroines in a sea of werewolves, vampires, witches and other things that go bump in the night. Although he does fall himself into the trap of using some of those familiar tropes, with its mythological roots Hearne has created an Urban Fantasy world that carves a niche of its own. He gets crucial points from me for trying some original things in the subgenre, and the strong clear voice and personality of Atticus clinches it for me.<br /><br />Although there are some weaknesses as I mentioned above, I am looking forward to picking up and reading the next two volumes in Kevin Hearne's Iron Druid trilogy.survival, and given that classic enmity between magic and cold iron, a little more explication of how he managed the feat of using in enchantment was something I would have liked to know more about.

0895260131|5.0|The highly dubious concept of Political Correctness (itself a system of social restraint that is eerily Orwellian both in its pervasiveness and in its seeming invisibility to the average individual)is flatly ignored in the writing of this book. Instead, ideas like 'speaking the truth', 'not deceiving the public to further various political agendas' and 'integrity on the part of the author' are embraced.  This will undoubtedly horrify many.  On the other hand, the clear headed among us-those who make judgments off of observations rather than 'is-ought fallacy' style thinking-will undoubtedly be horrified at the grotesque truth about Islam.  Mark Steyn put it best when he referenced the mandatory round of 'of courses', of course not every person who is a Muslim is a terrorist, of course you should not stoop to the level of fanatics and do harm to your fellow citizens, of course blah blah blah.  This is a book that doesn't flinch from the truth, and the truth about the history, philosophy, cruelty, repression, and aggression of the pseudo religious totalitarian system of government called Islam bears examination.
0307593495|5.0|John D. MacDonald promised that he had already picked the title and color for his final Travis McGee installment. A Black Border for McGee has never been published despite the series' incredible popularity, thus illustrating the problem of how to kill off both an aging series and an elderly protagonist. Henning Makell undertakes this task in The Troubled Man, the eleventh Kurt Wallander mystery,  and succeeds brilliantly.     Wallander is slipping. His memory has become unreliable. People he loves are dying-not from foul play necessarily but of the indignities of time. A Cold War crime grabs his attention when tHe father of his daughter's partner suddenly disappears. The subject is a retired senior naval officer, a submarine commander, and his disappearance takes place shortly afar Wallander and the officer briefly share a conversation at a party.  That they were both the grandfathers of the couples's young daughter gives the detective a personal stake in the investigation.     Slowly methodically Wallendar explores the disappearance. Then the officer's mystified wife disappears under similar circumstances. The deepening mystery consumes the detective even as his age takes its toll on him. Life as he has known it has changed, even if he continues to press forward with a personal investigation with geopolitical implications.    Old detectives, like old soldiers, fade away. This bittersweet conclusion to a great series will keep you engaged to the end.
B004EC5IV6|4.0|Film: ****  Bonuses: **    Amazing chapter in the evangelion rebuild, a must see and must own for any Eva fan.  Unfortunately like many anime companies they still don't know how to make a dvd with decent extras. All you get are some production screens, some production vids where they show you a scene's evolution from concept to final(sounds good on paper but was in dull in execution)  It would have been nice to have vignettes with the cast and crew about the behind the scenes making of the film... the commentary was mildly amusing at least.    This isn't bashing the film, it is top notch providing new experiences and intrigue for Eva fans for the first time in years I highly recommend, and I was very happy with my purchase, its just sad that the bonus features didn't match the quality of the film itself is all I only criticize in hopes that it helps anyone better understand this aspect of their purchase...

The Story still is the best, but I think that this part of the trilogy couldn't be more satisfying. There a lot of drama, action, and more of the story in this book than the first one. I still recommend this book to all teens who like drama, action, and well i guess SyFi too. Can't wait for the 3rd book to come out!!!!

You're talented and you have reassuring puppy dog eyes. I love you. Stop making s****y movies.\\"    Whiteout started out godawful and never got any better. After a while, it numbed me with a constant barrage of bad: bad acting, bad writing, bad direction. The word stultifying comes to mind. And, in a film of this \\"quality\\", making me wait 35 minutes for Gabriel Macht to appear is just unforgivable. I knew it would be awful, but the promise of Gabriel Macht gets me to watch some awful movies (I'm looking at you, The Spirit). Well, at least what I saw in the trailers and read in the reviews wasn't misleading. It was every bit as terrible as it looked. Bad movie lovers, rejoice; your search is over.
B004RLPWXS|5.0|I'm reviewing \\"All you Need In Now\\" here because I wanted to add that I love Duran Duran's new album.  I'm biased.  I am the type of Duran Duran fan that would love to see a concert where the group doesn't play one hit.  In other words, I love many of DD's side tracks.  I can't make any point that hasn't already been made, and thus the short review, just enjoy having the classic Duran Duran sound back.  It is a shame that despite the overwhelming favorable reviews at Amazon, their new songs have gotten zero radio play in my hometown.
0553582038|2.0|For now I have to say how much I concur with the other reviewers who found this book less than thrilling. The series has been in a nose dive since the second book. This fourth book feels like a death spiral. If the pilot doesn't do something fantastic in the next book to regain my interest and trust, I will bitterly call it quits and never look back.<br />Characters that I had committed myself to and fell in love with died in the last book and the characters who are left are barely mentioned!<br />Now the fourth book has me riding around with characters I could care less about.<br />I loathe the Iron men. I did not want to spend chapter after chapter reading about them. The only real significant development with the Ironborn could have been covered in one or two chapters! I care only a little more for Brienne because her fate is predictably entwined with the fates of Sansa and Arya. Thank god I don't have to read anymore from the POV of Davos, a character whose only purpose was to give you some insight into what Stannis was up to. The only Lannister I give a flying (fill in the blank) about is Tyrion and he disappears from the story early on. So what if Jaime is a changed man, I hated every second of being in the man's head (Ya that's right! I hold grudges!). There is some satisfaction in knowing Cersei is crazy and will eventually be strangled by Jaime. The Dornish, Samwell and all the other characters who didn't deserve their own chapters can tour the seven bloody hells riding the unicorns they showed up on.<br />Anyone else get really confused at first by whose POV you were reading in the chapter The Queenmaker and why should care about her? And Arya!?! WTF?? What kind of CRUEL cliff hanger was that? I ask you!!<br />If you were to reduce this book to only the important parts it might be less than half its length. All the rest of this book is filler and frustration.

If there's two barbershops side by side offering an identical haircut with an identical level of service, yet one charges $19 and the other charges $35... wouldn't the $35 one be worthy of a negative review based on price vs. the competition?    Now, these are great, 5-star books. I am a big fan of both the books and the new HBO series. But the Kindle price is nearly double the paperback version. Please don't use your hard-earned cash on this hogwash.     This is a one-star review because there is absolutely zero reason to buy this set.  Buy the paperback set, or buy the books individually on Kindle.

B000QUEHOO|2.0|[[ASIN:0143117009 Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed: Revised Edition]]    This is a fascinating book, but do not buy it on the Kindle.

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|This movie showcased Angelina's beauty and mysterious charm, that is by far, her greatest asset.  Johnny did well portraying a simple average Math teacher, who was taken away by Angelina from the very beginning.  This movie had a light, but elegant mix of suspense, star power, intrigue, adventure, comedy and a great ending.  I know it was not meant to blow us away, but that was not a bad thing.  I am a big fan of foreign films which are usually very similar to a film like this.  A good film is not always a measure of how MUCH is put into it, but sometimes about how LITTLE is put into it.  It kind of like a great meal consisting of small portions versus an average meal consisting of large portions.  Which would you prefer?  Americans tend to prefer the latter.  This film was not overdone, yet, is was very good in it's genre, which is not too common in American cinema. It was sad to read the bad reviews because I enjoyed the shoot locations and all of the actors; this movie really was well casted.
B003L20IFQ|3.0|I'm the [[ASIN:B00136NVXI Man in the Box]]. Buried. Won't you come and save me? Save me.<br /><br />Yup. That's Ryan Reynolds in this movie alright. He is buried in Iraq in a wooden box about the size of a coffin. And Reynolds along with little known Director Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s make you feel like you're buried right in there with him. No wait. They make you feel like YOU are the one buried in there alone. It's one of the creepiest feelings that a movie has ever given me. There were literally times where I found myself gasping for breath like I was having a claustrophobia attack or something. It was intense. Reynolds does an absolutely superb acting job in this one-man show and Director Cort&eacute;s keeps what you might preconceive as a boring movie an anxiety filled roller coaster ride.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars, you ask? Well, as effective as the movie was, let's just say I couldn't wait to get out of the box. With a running time of just over 90 minutes, I'd normally say that's a pretty good amount of time to spend with a movie...not too long and not too short. But in this instance it was too much of the same thing for too long. Man in the box. Cell phone. Lighter. Glowstick. And of course extreme desperation as the walls start closing in literally and figuratively.<br /><br />I find myself saying this about a lot of movies lately, but Buried would have been an ideal episode of HBO's now defunct [[ASIN:B0030E5PYO Tales from the Crypt]]. The episodes in Tales were 30 minutes apiece and at that length Buried might have been one of the most memorable episodes in Tales history. But alas, Tales has been off the air for years now so there really is no short form format for directors to present their stories (not that Cort&eacute;s would have chosen a short form format even if it was available). So after 45 minute of Buried, I started watching the Blu Ray disk at 1.5x speed...a pretty cool function of my Blu Ray player that keeps everything pretty normal except it's like everyone just talks really really fast. And there were even a few parts where I sped up the fast forward to 30x because it just got to the point of, \\"alright; I get it; man in the box; let's go; does he get out or not?\\"<br /><br />So would I recommend Buried? Yes, but it was one of the toughest movies to rate in a while. It was too long (2 stars). The acting/directing were excellent (4 stars). The story concept? Pretty dog-gone creepy, current and realistic (3 and a half stars).y fast.

B001UV4XI8|2.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan and pre-ordered the single DVD version of the movie. When I realized that there were no extras on it I actually considered buying the 3-disc blu-ray DVD combo pack, but apparently you can't watch the extras on DVD. What's up Warner Bros? Are you not making enough money on the franchise? You need to fix this.

1416589473|3.0|Ghosts of Ascalon is a pretty solid book for being based of a video game. I am a huge fan of Guild Wars, and cannot wait for Guild Wars 2, so I when I was about to read Ghosts of Ascalon I was excited to see what the authors had in store.    I am not going to go on some long winded review, just point out some likes and dislikes I had about the book. To begin with, the characters were not that well developed and through the story there is very little development or evolution among them to grow as something more then they are. I had the feeling through the entire story that the characters were disposable, as if they were just created to move the main plot and little else.    Main character Dougal is not that badly written, and he seems to be the most fleshed out character from the group, as the others seem rather flat. Dougal at least has some inner conflicts he is haunted with, while the other characters just seem to be along for the ride.    The female charr character, for example, just seemed to act and speak like a human and she wasn't that distinct. My favorite character, the male norn warrior, was a boisterous and loud clout like a norn should be and he was perhaps, best written because I truly believed and felt he was a norn.    The relationships between the characters also seemed to be contrive and there was little to no development between them besides stereotypical racism, dislike, and mistrust between them. Without giving a way too many spoliers, in one portion of the story one of characters gets killed and it just seemed to me like the other characters were like \\"Oh well, they are dead...time to move on.\\" There was not that much emotion between them, and reading this felt like drinking luke warm soda.    The writing style is simple and not that complicated, making this book easy and quick to read. I am rather surprised this was nominated for a Scribe Award, for I didn't think the writing was all that advanced or gripping.    On a plus side, the back storyand history that is told about the world of Guild Wars is well done, and for people who may not have played the game will be able to get caught up as to what is going on in some cases of the plot with Guild Wars and where Guild Wars 2 is heading.    The ending was the best part of the book, and when they finally made it into Ascalon City is where the story really picked up with some surprises at the end.    Overall, Ghosts of Ascalon is an easy and some what enjoyable read if you can look past its shortcomings. Good book for any Guild Wars fan, though only an average book for fantasy fans.

0307887960|1.0|I bought the Dukan diet after hearing about it from a colleague at work. I did not realize that it is another very low-carb/high-protein diet. I have been on the Perfect 10 Diet for the last year, and it worked great for me. I lost a total of 45 pounds, but I still have 10-12 more pounds to go.       On the Dukan Diet, you eliminate vegetables, fruits, and grains on the attack phase! Sounds like an easy plan to follow, right? But you'll find yourself with nothing to eat but protein!! Even Atkins didn't go that to that extreme. I have 3 young children, and a husband. They love their brown rice, and the healthy vegetable dishes I cook for them.     I learnt on The Perfect 10 Diet that processed meats (allowed on Dukan) are linked to cancer, and that diet soda (also allowed on Dukan) is linked to diabetes! I don't eat fake food anymore. I have no doubts that many people can lose tons of weight on Dukan, but for me, messing my health is not an option. Weight loss is not my only goal. I want to healthy, and be able to raise my children.
B004A8ZWTW|5.0|Wow.  This movie was mind blowing.  Being a big fan of Jane Eyre, I was somewhat skeptical of there being a movie that could possibly live up to such a great book.  This movie did.  It was filled with passion, excitement, danger, and secrets.  Mia Wasikowska did an amazing job of being Jane, and put into her everything that I had imagined her to be while reading the book.  The script was great, and the way Jane's story was told through flashbacks was extremely clever.  I loved this movie, and I really hope that more great movies are made for other classics like this, for all of those British literature readers out there.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|I only went to see this in theatres because friends where going, and I had nothing better to do. I expected this to be just another installment of the Fast & Furious franchise of movies, with a few drag races for pink slips, a brush with the law, and a few action scenes... and yes, that all was in this one, too... but there was so much more that I was not expecting to happen, and by end of this film I was glad I had gone to see it.    The movie kicks off right where the last left off. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is broken free from his jail sentence with the help from Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who has now instantly gone from a cop to a wanted criminal. They head down to South America and cook up a scheme to make a few bucks to start a new life. So the plot doesn't sound like much, they never really did before, did they? But I can assure you that the movie has some great action scenes, and not just involving the cars this time. Now that Brian is a wanted man, Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson is added to the franchise as a special forces (CIA?) cop named Hobbs. The Rock seemed too buff for the role, and seemed to be overacting the stereo typical role of the muscle buffed military style leader who will not take no for an answer, but he didn't take away from the acting anymore then Vin Diesel does... ok, enough bagging the acting, because it's been no better in any other one of these movies... so why am I saying this movie is rated 3 and a half to 4 stars? The ACTION! Some of the chase scenes in this movie are the best I have seen in years, even fans of car chases in James Bond and Death Race should enjoy the ones occurring in this movie, or in particular, the closing few minutes of the movie. It really came as a surprise to me, as the movie kind of started off with action, then had some more action, then got a little boring with all the sentimental characters manly love for each other, then in the end all of a sudden ....BOOM!!!!... and I wondered to myself \\"Where did that come from?\\". It seemed like something fans of Oceans 11 (the remake) would love. A cleverly put together little plot that is full of twists, turns, explosions, crashes and a whole vault of excitement.    I don't know if everyone will agree with me, but this Fast & Furious, for me, is the best of the whole series. I definitely recommend you see this, if you enjoy the types of movies I mentioned, and this will sure be a DVD/BlueRay disc or two worth purchasing in a few months time.    The reason I can't give it 5, isn't because of The Rock or Vin Diesel trying to out-do each other for an Academy Award, but because a few scenes in the middle needed to be trimmed down, and the final scenes after the awesome car chase needed to be shortened way down... the whole \\"where are they now\\"/ \\"And they lived happily ever after\\" things shouldn't go on for as long as they do in this. But apart from that, if you do see this, expect to see one of the best car chase scenes in a movie... EVER!    Update: DVD REVIEW. The DVD contains the theatrical and directors cut of the movie. The extended version has a deleted scene put back in about the lead up the end scheme, and a bit more blood during a gun battle towards the end of the film. Other then that, it's not very noticeable. There is a small featurette like extra where the cast and directors talk about the cars of the film, as well as two extra deleted scenes. The DVD transfer has been great, as expected, and watching it again I was able to get more into the film and understand the development scenes, so I take back what I said and I think the film has a much better flow the second viewing. Still a great get away scene at the end of the film, and I still say it's one of the best, and again, the best F&F movie so far.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  Definitely one of the best in the entire Harry Potter movie series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One was suspenseful, dramatic, romantic, and always, always exciting.  It did a great job of fitting so much plot into a really great piece of film, and I was never bored.  Although the movie was a little dark (and I don't just mean the plot--it was a little hard to see what the characters were doing onscreen at times) I thought that they did a great job of staying true to the film and the feel of Harry Potter.  Not everyone in my group loved the movie, so I wouldn't recommend it to younger people under age eleven (unless they are Harry Potter fanatics), but overall I thought it was great.  Can't wait to see part two!
0061914177|5.0|I love this book!  I first bought it in the audio format, and I've listened to it more than twenty times.  I wanted the 'manual' so I could continue to review other parts here and there, so I bought the book.  Definitely well worth the money.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie is one of the sweetest animated movies I've seen in a long time.  I'm not a fan of animation, but I've seen Despicable Me at least three times and I'm not tired of it yet.  The plot is refreshingly new; your same basic storyline (sort of) with extra details that give the movie a new and unique feel to it.  It is funny and sweet, great for any kind of age.  This movie was a real pleasure to watch.
B000000H42|5.0|now that just about all the record, cd stores are gone. Amazon provides me with the ultimate cd library to choose from. Havent had one thing to complain about. Great choices, Great service !
B003UESJFG|3.0|Seeing this movie reminded me of how I feel about animated movies.  They're okay, and now and again they're really great.  But most of the time, they're just average.  I think that was the same with this movie.  For an animated movie, the plot was very clever and had a good twist to it.  But it also had the same events that other animated movies have: the hero (or in this case, the villain) goes wrong, realizes that this isn't what he wants to do (usually because of loneliness or a romantic interest) and changes himself.  I didn't mind this movie, but I don't think it was a must-see.  I recommend it for younger kids who are tired of seeing your everyday animated movie with a regular hero in it.  They'll love this one because of its new twist on good and evil.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Just thought I'd throw in a little information for those looking to buy the Anthology from one of the \\"other\\" sellers below Amazon's. The Anthology that's being sold for 50 bucks below is in less exciting packaging than what the pictures illustrate. You get the nice silky black slip cover, but instead of the cool little book that holds the discs, it's just a typical blue Blu-Ray case with the six discs inside. Still an incredible collection, and the films look outstanding!! Alien looks like it could have been filmed in 2008. Just know that the other sellers are selling cheaper for a reason, which I suppose in hindsight I should have known. A fantastic purchase regardless.

B003MWHVLY|5.0|This young singer is a real talent in my mind. I love this CD and play it frequently. She has her own special way with music and most of my friends enjoy her music once I introduce them to her.  I keep my CD player loaded with 5 CD's and hers is one of them. She is a good companion for Keely Smith, June Christy and my other favorites. I love her style.
B000002J27|5.0|It took me a very long time to buy this. With close to no exception, I don't like Phil Collins. I am not going to say that I'm a die hard Peter Gabriel era Genesis person either, cause I think there is plenty of that stuff that is incredibly overrated. The only one that actually gets it's due praise is probably Lamb. Both Foxtrot and Selling England have plenty of garbage tracks on them. Anyway...I'm getting a little off topic already. I bought this based on reviews that said it's actually still very complex, rich, and still full on prog. Which is completely true. The song writing here is splendid. Phil's voice is stellar, and his drumming ain't no joke either! If you like prog, give this a chance, you will like it. Guaranteed. Just don't go into it thinking \\"Genesis.\\"

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|If a book doesn't grab me by page 100 then I usually just set it aside.  This book was recommended by a friend and I thought in defference to her I would continue on.  I should have just trusted my first gut instinct.  Although the premise is an interesting one, the book never got off the ground and toward the end it kind of stagnated even more.  The author threw in more characters at the end and they really added nothing to the plot, I kept waiting for an explanation.  The romance was not hot, it barely simmered.  At least a hot make out session was in order.  I have so many questions about the ending that I'm sure will be alluded to, even if not answered, in the next book.<br /><br />On the plus side; the author obviously researched places such as Oxford University and the hierarchy of that institution, the living areas and the library.  All of which I found interesting. I also enjoyed the fantasy of the witches' house.  It was another character in the story.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|This calendar is ok.  The user interface is pretty good but not great.  The widget is slightly better than the HTC Sense widget because it tells you the events for today and not just future events.  The dev needs to do a lot more polishing of this app to make it worth anywhere near $5 though.  For instance the calendar icon has a square of a darker color than the background around it.  That's just sloppy.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|The original cast is back (sans one) and they are aiming to pull off a heist after putting together a team. The Rock is a welcome addition to the franchise as a federal agent who specializes in tracking down fugitives. There is a lot of excitement in this one, with the distinctive storyline of the bad guys being the good guys because they are stealing from worse guys. It makes sense when you see it. Are there some improbabilities that occur during the course of the action? Certainly, but if not taken too seriously, this is a good old-fashioned action film.  Car chases, gun fights and explosions are ubiquitous in Fast Five, and if that is your idea of a good time, sit back and enjoy the ride.
B00466HN68|5.0|Duncan Jones' \\"Source Code\\" is a taut, intricately plotted thriller with richer-than-usual characters, unusual depth of feeling, and interesting metaphysical overtones. Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), a former helicopter pilot in Afghanistan, finds himself caught in an endless time loop controlled by a sinister scientist (Jeffrey Wright). Stevens is transported again and again to the last eight minutes before a terrorist explosion on a Chicago commuter train, charged with finding the bomber and preventing further carnage. Stevens is forced to scrutinize every passenger on the crowded train, and instructed to use whatever violence he must (all the passengers are dead anyway). However, complications accrue with each successive eight-minute drama, especially Stevens' growing love for fellow passenger Christina (Michelle Monaghan).<br /><br />Jones and screenwriter Ben Ripley have all sorts of throat-catching surprises for us, including one major plot revelation they spring on us about halfway through (I guessed it about three minutes before the big reveal). With all the nonstop thrills, however, the biggest point about \\"Source Code\\" is the feelings you develop toward the characters, especially Stevens. Jake Gyllenhaal is extremely appealing as Stevens, combining George Clooney-style heroics with golden-retriever lovability. Michelle Monaghan, with her delicate, heart-shaped face, is no slouch in the lovability department, and Vera Farmiga--as Capt. Goodwin, Stevens' military \\"handler\\"--develops enormous sympathy for her character. Combining thrills and emotion to a remarkable degree, \\"Source Code\\" is a masterful film of its type.
B000SX9NAC|5.0|I get lucky sometimes.     Lucinda Williams showed up in New Yorker magazine. I bought the album based on the review in which she quoted Dylan. It turned out to be one of my favorite albums for the next decade.    The Joshua Tree was another: U2 was in the soundtrack for Blown Away, and I kept that cd in my player for the next four years. Only rarely did it leave.    My point, of course, is that I found all of these albums by chance that I'd like to think wasn't really a 'chance' occurance--it was as though I was meant to discover this music...    LCD Soundsystem was another such case. I found them through a CD club that I failed to participate in properly and as such, only received one CD. (I was supposed to send all the members a disc and just never got around to it.)  Why I like it: this is one of those albums that doesn't really grab you on the first listen. Instead, it sneaks up on you and works best after about the tenth listen. Other albums upon which this occurred (for me) include Radiohead's OK Computer, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, and Beck's Odelay. These, of course, are some of my favorites: they give the listener something to chew on, something to think about, something to reflect upon, and ultimately, something to enjoy on a level much greater than that of, say, Justin Beiber.   There is a time and a place for Justin Beiber. But, ultimately, some of us want to listen to adult music...  There is a real pathos in the lyrics. Granted, there is a thick layer of irony surrounding everything about this album, and I suspect that we don't get to take anything too seriously, but at the same time, the irony is not defensive, self-defensive, or otherwise.  In other words, I'm not sure where to engage this album, and that ambiguity makes things interesting and fun.  In the end, this is a great album, and I recommend it for all.
B004I4H8PO|4.0|Maybe my math ain't too good, but wouldn't 2011 be the 41st anniversary ? I dunno - like a lot of people, I used to think that 2000 was the start of the \\"new millenium,\\"  but in fact, if you think about it, 2001 was the first year of the \\"new millenium,\\"  because a millenium is a thousand years, not 999....Well, enough with the nit-picking; I'm probably wrong again.    I went right to the store on 4/26, and then another, and then another - no one had it - until finally Rodney at Barnes & Noble figured out that this was an \\"only by special order\\" release - the stores wouldn't just stock it automatically, I guess because it is so limited.  So I  had him order it, and finally my 3 day wait is over.    I was wary about what condition the set would be in, given some of the other reviews.  I see what the one guy was saying - I open up the lp gatefold, and 2 of the discs are just out loose, and the other 3 only have a little slot to call home- TERRIBLE idea !!!  An expensive, rare  recording deserves its own jewel box - I can't imagine how anyone would think otherwise.  So I checked the 2 loose discs.  One looked ok, and plays fine.  The other had the dreaded gummy / adhesive substance that another reviewer mentioned.  Just my luck: the one with the adhesive on it is the DVD with the 5.1 mix !  I did take that other reviewer's advice and carefully cleaned it off.  I used hydrogen peroxide, which seemed to be the safest rubbing fluid I could find on short notice.  Fortunately, that did the trick.    Not only that, but I had a neat little synchronicity:  listening late at night / early in the AM (no steady work these days, so what the heck !) to the audio on my dvd player, and we get to the end of the song \\"Layla,\\"  after Jim Gordon's piano solo, and the very end where you hear the bird twitter.  Well, I just happened to have the window open, and I guess the birds outside heard it, it sounded so realistic. I'm thinking \\"I don't remember birds chirping on into 'Thorn Tree Inthe Garden' - when I realize that it is not the album, but all the birds outside responding to the \\"Layla\\" chirp. (I think I read Duane was responsible for that...)    The mix sounds great - the drums are tight as always, and there is nice differentiation between the guitars.  I prefer the 20th anniversary mix of \\"Keep On Growin' \\" where Whitlock lets out a shriek in the beginning, but hey - I've got both.  I like that although there is no actual video, it shows you onscreen exactly who plays what on every cut.  When I first heard about this set, I had some hopes that maybe the 4 songs we get from the Johnny Cash Show appearance would be on video on the dvd, but I guess they couldn't get the rights, or didn't have all the footage.  Oh, well, I know there now is a commercial release of Johnny Cash's show which at least has the 2 songs that were broadcast.    I'm very glad for the CD of bonus studio songs - definitely nice to have that updated since the \\"Crossroads\\"  set.  Glad also that the couple tunes with Harrison and Dave Mason were included.  It is a little known fact that Dave Mason was actually a member of Derek & the Dominos, but besides his work on these singles and \\"All Things Must Pass,\\"  his only contribution was the one live gig he played with them - their very first ever gig (I was found a pic of this in an English paper, with Mason & EC playing acoustic on the \\"Easy Now\\" opener).   Apparently EC told Dave after this that he really should pursue his own solo career (not out of dislike for him, but out of genuine respect for his talents).      I'm off to read the book that comes with it (I wonder if it is similar to the Derek & the Dominos \\"Layla\\" book I bought a few years ago), and later to hear the live discs !  In closing, the fluff, such as the Layla cover \\"pop-up,\\"  the concert ticket replicas and the \\"Derek Is Eric\\"  buttons were a bit too fluffy for my taste, as really is the vinyl album that came with it.  I have no use for vinyl, even to collect, so I'll probably just sell or give it away.    They DID pick the right ticket replica to enclose - the 12/1/70 Tampa show, which of course was a rare one (of 2 , I believe) in which Duane Allman actually joined the Dominos in concert  (below average quality bootleg recordings circulate....)
B004S699K4|1.0|Best Buy has these on sale now so I have it prior to the release date.  Avoid it no matter what.<br /><br />I already have the Candian triple feature blu-ray with this movie, but I was intrigued when I read that in this release the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen are removed to actually show more picture.  It was cheap and I'm definitely a cult fan, so I grabbed it.  Yeah, not worth it.  It makes it look bad...too much sky above people's heads in lots of shots and things like that.<br /><br />The picture quality is overall atrocious.  It looks like a DVD print with a noise reduction filter applied to it.  Some parts make you feel like your player or tv is messed up because of flicker or jitter, but no, it's just a horrible transfer.  Definitely NOT 1080P even though it says it is.  It also says the audio is \\"2.0 STERE\\"...great attention to detail guys.<br /><br />I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and say hold out for a better release or get the Candian triple feature...it's much better quality and true to it's claim of 1080i.

0375842209|5.0|I thought this book was magnificent.  The book is told from the perspective of death during World War 2 and it follows the life of Leisel, a little girl who is living with her foster parents in Nazi Germany.  Leisel stole her first book at her brother's gravesite, and her foster father teaches her to read.  She steals books whenever she can and Death gives her the nickname of \\"The Book Thief\\".    This book was truly a pleasure to read.  I thought it may be quite depressing and strange written from Death's perspective but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the story.  I loved Leisel and her foster father's characters.  It is a sad novel, but I think given that it is Death's perspective that's to be expected.  This is one of those books that will stay with you after you've finished reading it.    Highly recommend it!
B0038BBA4I|4.0|A passionate, emotional, raw album. Right up my alley! I love the main guy's voice. It's no surprise Mumford & Sons are loved by so many, their sound is infectious.
0312323867|5.0|This novel is the sequel to \\"Something Borrowed\\" and I was a bit unsure at first whether I'd enjoy it given that I didn't think much of the main character, Darcy while reading the first book.  However, as I read on I found myself warming to her character and in the end liking her.    ***Contains spoilers*** After Darcy's fiance, Dex, leaves her for her best friend, a pregnant Darcy packs up and moves to London to visit her long time friend, Ethan.    Darcy's character grows up a lot in this book.  I would have loved to have heard more about what Dex and Rachel were up to now, but realise that this novel is from Darcy's perspective and it made sense not to have too much insight into their lives seeing as though she was moving on with hers in London.    I found this book really enjoyable, and even ended up liking Darcy's character!  Would definitely recommend reading \\"Something Borrowed\\" first.

I enjoued it so much I then purchased the series from which the Serenity movie is based.

One word of caution - I ran for years with no watch, just for the pleasure - having some gizmo urging me on has caused me to \\"run\\" into the normal suite of running injuries as I upped milage and speed at the urging of my electronic \\"coach\\".  There is something to be said for being fat, dumb and happy with one's running without any monitors...

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan  2-4 players  5-6 players when playing with [[ASIN:B000W7JWYG The Settlers of Catan 5-6 Player Extension]]    Pros  *This is a great gateway or starter game.  *Easy to learn.  *Quick Pace.  *Good looking on the table.  *Good for children.  *Modular board means that it is different every time.    Cons  *Board can warp easily(mine at least)  *Some people can get angry when the get cards stolen from them.  *Only really good with 3-4 players.    Descriptions  Settlers of catan is a great entertaining game with a little take that action. I would recommend this game for almost any family, however, I wouldn't play with less than 3 people. The main goal of the game is to get a certain number of victory points, which can be gained for settlements (everyone starts with 2), Cities (which must replace settlements), having the longest road, the most army cards, or buying developement cards (some of which are soldiers, victory points, or allow you to get resources). A game usually takes about 40 minutes (for my group). You can trade resources with others at any rate (1:1, 2:1, etc...). There is also a theif that moves on a roll of 7, which alows the roller to steal a card from their opponent.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This is the second full size Nikon flash I've bought.  I needed a second flash to use with my SB-600 for off camera lighting.  This flash is better in every way than the SB-600.  The useability of this flash is amazing compared to the SB-600.  The new power switch makes it really easy to switch between ttl/manual flash and between on-camera/wireless/commander modes.  No longer is there any need to pull up secret menus to get to the wireless flash functions.  The addition of the SU-4 slave flash mode makes this a worthy upgrade from the SB-600 alone.  Performance wise, I feel that this flash gives me better exposures than my SB-600.  I felt the SB-600 tended to overexpose by a 1/3 stop while this tends to underexpose by a 1/3 stop but with less hot spots.  Both easy enough to adjust on with the flash exposure.  Speaking of flash exposure though, the one gripe I have with the SB-700 is the flash exposure adjustment is more complicated than the SB-600.  The big button on the back of the SB-600 was idiot proof.  The two button system on the SB-700 just takes a little more time for minor adjustments.  One other thing to be aware of is that the SB-700 defaults to TTL-BL for all photos unless center-weighted exposure is selected on the camera.  Although I initially found this annoying, I found it was implemented much better than the TTL-BL used on the SB-600 which tended to give me improper exposures.    Although the SB-700 currently runs ~$100 more than the SB-600, the additional accessories included with the flash make up for the difference.  The included \\"stofen-style\\" filter and two color gels make for a great kit without having to buy additional 3rd party supplies.  Also, I love having the built-in flash card. I know I could use a 3x5 card to do the same thing, but having it always there means I'm more likely to be able to use it when necessary.    If you are looking at the SB-600 and SB-700, definitely swallow the extra cash and pay for the SB-700.  You will not be disappointed.  Adding an external bounce flash was one of the best changes I made to my pictures allowing me to really get the colors I wanted.    ps - I learned today the flash is pretty resilient too! Fell over on a 6' light stand onto concrete with only a few minor scratches.  Everything else works great.
B004YNWBZG|1.0|You would think that after almost 10 full seasons (180+ episodes) that Clark Kent would atleast learned how to fly. Well, ladies and gentlemen he still hasn't learned how to fly. It also seems that Smallville will never come full circle on anything because they keep having episodes about Zod, Lex, Lionel, etc. Plus some of these episodes don't make any sense and would make a person lose brain cells by watching them.  This used to be one of my favorite shows, but now everytime I see the name 'Smallville' I cringe.

B004A8ZWTW|5.0|I have been dying to see this film because I could tell from the preview that it was going to be brilliant. Older versions have never quite impressed me. This was perfectly cast, perfectly scored, and accurate when compared with the novel. One reviewer said this version was too dark. Not so. The book is dark and filled with gothic undertones that are sometimes (tragically) glossed over in older versions. This is not a Jane Austen novel, much as I love her. Sorry.     Gothic novels were dark and they were popular during Charlotte Bronte's lifetime, so it is natural that gothic elements would be found in her writing. The novel almost reads as a suspense, as Jane senses something strange about Thornfield Hall, and this film succeeded in capturing that essence. The cinematography was breathtaking. Jane was PERFECT; so much so that I feel she deserves an award of some kind for her performance. If you have read and loved this novel, as I have, I'm sure you will agree. For those of you who love film scores, this one is definitely worthy of your attention.

0374290024|5.0|This book attempts to answer questions such as: (1) What advantages did the West have that  enable it to dominate other regions at certain times in history.  (2) *When* did the West  dominate?  And, (3) having attempted to learn something about social development and the  advancement of society, what can we say about our future, both in the West and in the  East.    I'm hoping we'll get answers to the questions such as: (1) What were those (historical)  strengths?  (2) Are those same strengths and characteristics still advantageous, given our  current problems? (3) Who has and is gaining those strengths?  Who is losing them?  And,  of course, (4) what can be done?  Is there anything effective that can be done, both to  advance our society and to protect us from some of the environmental, climate, and  resource problems that lie in our future?    For me, since I'm a techie and a computer programmer, chapter 10, \\"The western age\\" is an  especially interesting one, because it picks apart the story of how power (mostly steam  power, I suppose), innovation, technology, and mechanization helped break through what  Morris calls a \\"hard ceiling\\".  That's interesting because this story might give us hints  about how to break through the next hard ceiling or, if we are in the process of some sort  of break through, how that process might proceed.  I believe that each of these major  moves in technology is started by some significant new enabling technology, e.g. the  printing press (although Morris denies that the printing press really changed  communication, not level of social development), the steam engine, accurate watches for  navigation, telegraph, ..., and the Internet.  If Morris is correct in the last few  chapters of this book that we are approaching some sort of cataclysmic change, it is  extremely important that we understand the nature of the change we are currently going  through and also how this transformation might be influenced.    Migration and immigration-- Morris has interesting things to say about migration, in  particular migration over the long term.  He claims that one of the enablers of a modern  Europe was what he calls the closing of the Steppe Highway.  The effect of that blockage  was to protect Europe from disruptive invasions from the east, enabling it (Europe) to  advance to levels of social development that occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries.    Labor costs are a worthwhile point of view for thinking through the changes that Morris  describes in Europe's industrial revolution. A central theme or basis for explanation is  that people are naturally lazy, greedy, and frightened (or chose euphemisms if you  prefer), and that this motivates them to invent and work towards what is easier, more  rewarding, and safe.  Apply that to labor availability and use; then you will soon arrive  at explanations for mechanization, labor efficiency studies, etc. What kinds of incentives  does this apply to, e.g. the drive to mechanize?  What other incentives push  mechanization? Reliability of labor and the labor force?  Other, non-wage costs, e.g. the  demand for education, medical care, etc?  Worries about dependable labor availability.  (I  know that my relatives in California worry about whether there will be a sufficient labor  force available right when fruit is on the trees and must be harvested immediately.    Perhaps we ask questions about the quality of the metrics that Morris uses to measure  social development.  By that I mean, is one kind of energy use just as good as another?  Isn't a more efficient use of energy, even when the total energy consumed is lower, a sign  of a more highly developed society?  And, is all manufacturing the same?  Perhaps building  houses is not as good in some sense as manufacturing farm implements or some other  machinery that helps to produce food.  Perhaps burning lots of coal, especially if done in  an uncontrolled and \\"dirty\\" way, produces a poorer quality of life than alower use of  energy might.    A higher-level question should also be asked about Morris's comparisons of East and West:  Is this a zero-sum game?  If one nation, region,  or alliance wins, must others lose?  Isn't it possible that in the future, all, or at least most, of us could become richer?  Even while the East, in particular China and some of the nations once called the \\"Asian  tigers\\" close the lead, isn't it possible that the West will still remain ahead, and that  it will have even more wealth at its disposal, while societies in the East advance, too?  If, after reading this book, you need help sleeping at night, then you might try to  convince yourself that what Morris calls climate weirding will force the industrial  nations to organize and cooperate in response.    Although much of this book discusses the relative position between societies, it also  spends a good deal of effort on the problem of whether all or any of the advanced  societies in the world today can proceed.  Can we continue on our present trajectory  without hitting some unbreakable ceiling, or even without descending into some apocalyptic  state of dis-organization or resource depletion or destruction?  So, we have to ask  whether it is reasonable to expect that the four measures of social development used by  Morris can continue on an upward trend.  In the long-term, don't these measures have to go  down as well as up?  Isn't there something self-limiting about the use of accelerating  amount of energy, for example?  Yes, learning how to use energy enables us to use more of  it, but won't there be exogenous limiting pressures?  To give him credit, Morris is well  aware of this worry; in fact, he discusses it and tries to factor it into his theory and  calculations.    I'm going to introduce an alternative thing to worry about.  This book encourages us to  think about when and why the East will catch up with the West, even as they both advance.  I'm worried that both the East and the West will devolve or even implode, possibly while  the East does so more slowly relative to the West, as nations in both the East and West  consume more of the easily accessible natural resources that have been enabling recent  progress.  Morris assumes that more social development, more use of resources, more energy  use, and, even, more ability to wage war are all signs of progress. Morris worries about  this, too, although his suspicions about what will go wrong are different from mine and  are quite a bit more cataclysmic.  My worries are that as the world population soars in  response to our improved abilities to feed and care for people, we may see limits that  can't be finessed by improved technology.  There is the possibility that we, both in the  West and in the East, will need to learn to do more with less and to even to make do with  less. It'd be nice to be able to believe that those hockey stick, elbow- shaped graphs  that Morris shows can go up forever.  But, I doubt that. Even if we do not have the  cataclysms that Morris worries about,  I believe that the green revolution can *not* go on  producing increasingly larger supplies of food, nor can fish farming in the ocean can  produce increasing supplies of fresh fish, etc. There are going to be some limits and some  costs.  All societies face that sooner or later.  It might even be that the higher levels  of social organization, information processing, and ability to use energy will bring us up  against those limits all the faster.    Perhaps we need a higher order, wider scale of social organization. But, given that the  most powerful country and the one most needed to drive an effort to create that  organization has in the last ten years outlawed serving French Fries because they had a  foreign name, I don't have much in the way of hope about that.    I have these criticisms for the assumption that continuing growth is the only conceivable  goal: (1) It can't continue; those elbow-shaped graphs in Morris's book that go steeply  upward cannot continue for long.  There are some limits (some hard and some merely  uncomfortable) that will be imposed on increasing city size, increased use of natural  resources, accelerating use of energy, etc. (2) It does not produce the results we want.  Too many are left out, while a few acquire extreme amounts of wealth.  So that some can  benefit from these advances, so many must live in poverty.  Yes, overall standards of  living have improved, but we simply must do a better job of enabling more of the world-  wide population improve their lives in a sustainable way.    One of the most interesting aspects of Morris's book is his awareness of this paradox.  And he attempts to analyze the future, several possible futures in fact, in the light of  that paradox and his theory of social development.    If I were to stretch for one complaint about this book, it would be that several concepts  that I tried to look up in the index were not there, even though they seemed central to  Morris's thinking.  I notice that Amazon has a Kindle version (I read paper), so I suspect  that if you read that, you'd just be able to search for what you want.    For those of you who want a somewhat more approachable, or at least shorter, book on why  societies fall behind and collapse, take a look at \\"The Collapse of Complex Societies\\", by  Joseph A. Tainter. Tainter's view seems to be that a society is a resource consuming  organism; that as a society depletes resources, it becomes more complex in an attempt to  acquire those resources; and that eventually that attempt fails.  Comparing that line of  thinking with Morris's ideas on our society's future leads to interesting, but gloomy,  conclusions.
B003Y5H5KQ|2.0|Director Joe Wright steps away from prestige Oscar bait like \\"The Soloist\\" and \\"Atonement\\" to drop a loud, fast, violent graphic novel of a movie.    The film -- about a young girl trained to exact brutal revenge on a high-level spook -- can't quite rise past its extremely familiar story and characters.     While it has style to spare, a lot of its quirkier elements feel completely contrived (circles are a recurring, heavy-handed motif), and an odd, jolting score by The Chemical Brothers at times makes the picture feel more adventurous than it actually is.     Villainess Cate Blanchett -- totally channeling Tilda Swinton -- has killer suits, cool hair and a mind-boggling sorta-Southern accent, but she and the other bad guys never really seem all that threatening when placed against Saoirse Ronan's pint-sized assassin.     Two key fights scenes -- one in a ship yard; the other, an eye-popping real-time six-on-one brawl in a subway station -- are high points.

0060531053|3.0|This review is on the kindle edition.    While I found this book useful in areas, I also feel it was lacking in other areas. I cannot quite put my finger on it... At one time I previously had an earlier version and liked it at that time. Maybe it's the kindle layout? Maybe I was expecting specific recipes? I'm not sure.    In the kindle edition the tables do not appear well. Also do not expect recipes. No discussion on today's available cleaning and sanitation chemicals other than bleach. In all, I mainly do not like this book on the Kindle and wish I would have bought this as a 2nd choice book in paperback instead.

B00004RF83|5.0|Seven Arts Productions presents \\"SEVEN DAYS IN MAY\\" (1964) (118 min/B&W) -- Starring Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Frederic March, Ava Gardner, Edmond O'Brien & Martin Balsam<br /><br />Directed by John Frankenheimer<br /><br />Adapted by Rod Serling from the best-selling novel by Fletcher Knebel and Charles Waldo Bailey II, Seven Days in May was allegedly inspired by the far-right ramblings of one General Edwin Walker. Burt Lancaster plays General James M. Scott, who, convinced that liberal President Jordan Lyman (Fredric March) is soft on America's enemies, plots a military takeover of the United States. Every effort made by President Lyman to find concrete evidence of General Scott's scheme is scuttled by political protocol, human error and accidental death. Ultimately, Lyman must rely upon the man who first uncovered the plot: Scott's best friend, Colonel \\"Jiggs\\" Casey (Kirk Douglas). John Frankenheimer's terse direction and Ellsworth Fredericks' stark black and white photography add considerably to the this absolute ripper of a film.<br /><br />Oscar Nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Edmond O'Brien)<br />Oscar Nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White (Cary Odell & Edward G. Boyle)<br /><br />Special footnote: -- Kirk Douglas had originally signed to play Gen. James Mattoon Scott. Douglas eventually realized that his friend Burt Lancaster would be ideal as Scott, and took the less flashy role of Col. Martin \\"Jiggs\\" Casey after Lancaster signed on to the film.

B000SEKO4K|2.0|I had to return this after a year when I noticed that one of Hamlet's lines was missing! An obvious typo. His name is printed in all caps, but the line is left out. It's in Act I, Scene 5. The scene with the GHOST. HAMLET says \\"Speak, I am bound to hear.\\" Except in this version Hamlet doesn't say it.<br /><br />I'm guessing the error must have happened in the conversion from print to digital. It's a very nice edition otherwise and I hope to re-acquire it someday after the error has been fixed. I like that it has Thomas Moore, which Shakespeare is believed to have partly written. The rep at Amazon couldn't have been nicer and said he'd pass on the error to the folks at Oxford.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Fast Five in my opinion is the best installment out of the 5 movies. The last one was awesome but this just had so much original action sequences with the dragging of a vault down the street causing havoc, cop cars racing and a truck you can use to steal cars off a train. Very fun movie with everything you want out of an action movie. Definitely recommended. And on a side note, the fight between the Rock & Vin Diesel is just bad a$$!
0393338827|5.0|I am extremely impressed at Michael Lewis' ability to take a very complex issue - the credit default swaps and subprime mortgage fiasco - and bring it down to a level that most readers can follow.  I am not being condescending when I say most readers as this stuff is very confusing.  So confusing that Wall Street experts could not completely understand nor could they follow their transactions as greed pulled them over the brink and into the abyss.<br /><br />The only trouble I had with this book was the constant muscular reaction that my arm had as I read - it constantly wanted to throw the book through the wall.  It will be nearly impossible for any reader to finish this book and say, \\"Wow, I'm so glad that we spent $800 billion saving these guys on Wall Street with my money.  I feel so bad that they were making $25 million and still could not make enough so that they had to invent transactions and counter-transactions that put their companies and the financial system into ruin.\\"  Instead, you are going to want to call your congressman/woman and tell them if they ever use your money to bailout a bunch of greedy, obnoxious, smarter than thou, idiots, that you are going to...., well, not vote for them again.  Oh, wow, that will change their minds.  Sorry, it's easy to get on the soapbox after finishing this book.<br /><br />Lewis has written a very readable book on the subprime market collapse and uses a couple of traders and trading companies from both sides of the event to illustrate how it went down.  I was mesmerized by the audacity and stupidity of S&P and Moody's as they rated these bond pools.  Additionally, I found out things about bond traders and bond trading that I had not a clue.  The ability to make markets and hold them in the middle of a meltdown was just contrary to anything you read about in the papers.<br /><br />This should be mandatory reading for any taxpayer just to see what the powers that be really think of throwing your money away.  Saving the likes of Goldman Sachs after reading this becomes ludicrous - and I'm not saying that Tim Geithner or Hank Paulson, both being from Goldman, had any allegiances or anything.  I mean, they are government officials doing what is right for the country, aren't they?<br /><br />Read this one as soon as possible.  It might be the best investment of your time that you ever make.  You'll want to know just how unbelievably stupid and greedy the people were that created this meltdown.achs after reading this becomes ludicrous - and I'm not saying that Tim Geithner or Hank Paulson, both being from Goldman, had any allegiances or anything.

B004L79VUI|4.0|I just finished rereading Levon's book about THE BAND and it occurs to me that ROBBIE'S new record is just a continuation of his role in the band.  Darker, thicker more atmospheric tones are his tools and this album reflects them really well.  Most of the songs begin from a place of solid back beat which was Levon's signature so long ago.  I enjoy Robbie's voice even though it's pretty limited and sounds the same in nearly every tune.  I miss THE BAND like I miss my childhood and this record has little to do with the past.  But the future seems in good hands with great veteran song writers like R.R.  Nice job.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|I bought this flash to expand the capabilities of my D-5000 system.  It has most of the perks that its more expensive SB-900 has...but fits my needs more readily.  It was easy to set-up and use.  The read-out on the back of the unit is clear.  The choices are easy to learn.  I chose the diffuser for some eBay shots that came out super!  The other filters that pop on the unit help when shooting in manual mode on the camera.    I like the strength of the flash, the auto adaptation for my zoom, and the iTTL feature that takes the guesswork out of exposures.  It even senses the camera settings in most modes...with the exception of the scene modes.  I like the simple way it can be moved to manual for special situations.    Quality of the product is very good.  The hot-shoe fitting is metal and solid.  The shoe lock is easy to use and makes the flash sit on top of the camera securely.    A much improved speedlight over the SB-600.  Go for it!
B000HEWEE4|4.0|spoiler references throughout!    As others have said, you either go with this movie and its premise, or you don't.  What I like about it is the overall tone of the film -- it has an autumnal, melancholy quality throughout (like an attic of old letters).  There are one or two moments that don't quite work (a couple of clunky Nora Ephron touches we could do without,  the recurring use of \\"Notorious\\" (of course a dull man wouldn't understand, or remember Valentine's Day), CUE THE SIGNIFICANT MUSIC stuff.....), but there are also grace moments here and there.  A tree appears out of nowhere.   Someone suddenly remembers a kiss and some vague part of a seemingly casual conversation in a backyard.  Things like that.  There is a lovely quality to the way the main characters slide in and out of meeting each other, and struggle to almost remember, like a word on the tip of the tongue.     Contrary to some of the previous reviewers, the script is actually very tightly constructed for the most part (a rewatching reveals interesting touches that seem initially implausible -- how does he remember and then find the exact Valentine's Day reference in the final letter? but then we recall that it was just that letter that was the breakup letter she sent him, and she gives us part of the details in voice over). But there are leaks. It seems hardly likely that after she rediscovers Persuasion in its plastic wrap, given its symbolic importance, she would not think of at least tracking Alex down once more -- she knows his name and what he does.  The scene is just there as a device. I've spent a little time trying to work out the details of the time shifts, and there are one or two of them that I think don't quite hold together:  the trouble is keeping track of what changes -- we are never quite sure if and when the past is simultaneously being changed through the new intervention in time of their correspondence -- the classic problem.  I think they are nevertheless mostly well handled (the dog's role is nicely woven into this, though her role as helpful angel is a bit overdone).  It's not completely clear what year the final scene is in (I think 2008, but it could have been spelled out a bit more, we only learn the date from the brother's reference to the accidental death exactly two years previously).  A tiny bit more signposting would have helped: giving us the date of the dinner would have helped enormously -- one keeps thinking it must be one of the various Valentine's Days which it isn't.  (Two years tomorrow makes it early 2007, I think).  The return of the other boyfriend must be happening through 2007 and into early 2008.  And so on.  The big obvious technical flaw in the movie is that Kate doesn't remember the face of the dead man she worked so hard to save, in a situation which meant so much to her -- this is completely implausible.  It might work if she were some kind of unthinking mechanistic doctor and he was just another corpse, but, alas, she makes a big deal of what this dead man meant to her.  Makes no sense.    The second best scene in the movie is the backyard scene, which is really well done -- beautifully paced throughout, a real actors' scene.  It's only drawback is the second-rate Paul McCartney song which, like so many of his second-rate songs, painfully reminds us of the first-rate songs he used to write.       The best scene in the film is the second last scene in the architect's office when Sandra Bullock realizes what has happened -- the camera is right tight on her face, and she does a lovely piece of acting, you can watch her thinking through her eyes.    \\"Il Mare\\", the Korean original, is quite a lot like this version, except that it isn't as tightly constructed as this remake, and has some plot variations.  It's also a lot more \\"art movie\\". The lovers in the Korean version are more juvenile and they're more like students (and so they have a kind of innocent cuteness about them which is endearing -- their problem isnot just love, they are still wandering around contemporary urban Korea and haven't yet figured out what they going to do with their lives; unlike Kate and Alex who are both already in careers).   There's also a Korean \\"ghost story\\" feel to the whole thing.  Unusually, I think the remake is a better film.

0307887960|4.0|This high protein plan was reportedly used by Kate Middleton and her mother to slim for the royal wedding.  Divided into four stages, it focuses on unlimited consumption of low fat proteins with the gradual addition of vegetbles and then fruit.  The first stage, dubbed the attack phase, allows unlimited protein, a small amount of oat bran and non-fat yogurt.  Cruise, the second phase requires alternating pure protein days with those incuding select (generally non starchy) vegetables.  The third phase, consolodation permits inclusion of other foods including bread and fruit as well as two celebration meals.  The final stage, Stabilization involves eating the foods you are allowed in the third phase but watching that you don't gain the weight back. You must commit to one set day a week where you eat nothing but lean protein and the oat bran is increased to three tablespoons a day.<br /><br />This diet differs from Atkins in that fat is eschewed and dairy and bran are included fron the outset.  Dukan recommends drinking copious amounts of water and gentle exercise beginning with walking and light calisthentics.<br /><br />This is probably a healthier version of Atkins since it does not use  fat. The dairy and oat bran also help.  However, I do not approve of the reliance on artificial sweetners. I suggest relying on spices instead. Cinnamon, for instance, adds sweetness and flavor without calories or carbs.  Plain water or seltzer water is prefereable to diet soda.<br /><br />The real question is whether it works.  I have just started and will update in a month.

Very easy to learn and also helps encourage pre-planning for upcoming moves.  My family and I have all enjoyed this game so much that even my husband got involved.  Definitely one of the best games for a \\"WHOLE\\" family.  Can't miss buying this game.
B004G600A4|5.0|Disney did it again with their 50th animated film!  Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi make a fabulous duo.  Still in shock they lost the Oscar for best song.  This is one you'll watch over and over again.
B004KSQN7C|3.0|at first i was Very disappointed in this CD. I have her last 2 cd's and they were excellent. this one has grown on me but some of the songs sound alike. i do like \\"hold it against me\\"  \\"selfish\\" is okay and \\"don't keep me waiting\\" is HOT!!!!   I have kept an open mind and keep listening, so she does rock out and a very talented girl.  britney keeps sex in her songs and i like that.
B000TP5T6Q|5.0|I'm in love with this DVD, I only wish that all of the musicians in the orchestra are listed.  Unfortunately, their names are anonymous, although you live and breathe with them through every note that they perform.  I love seeing Lenny bring out the best in the opera singers and musicians, correcting them, coaching them, sharing interpretations, begging them to get into his head so that they know what he is trying to achieve.  I love seeing the emotional energy of musicians in rehearsing and recording sessions.  Forget concert halls and tuxedos, this is where the soul emerges and you can witness the creative result as if you were part of the orchestra.  They become \\"one\\" to create this masterpiece.
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|One of the epic genre's most reliable warhorses, with at least nine screen adaptations from the first one-reel silent version in 1901 to the 2001 Polish minseries-cum-movie, Henry Sienkiewicz's Quo Vadis in many ways set the template for all the epics about the Roman Empire's persecution of Christians that would follow, from The Sign of the Cross to The Robe. As might be expected from the novel's 1895 vintage, it's more myth than history, but its twin narratives of lovers initially separated by religious differences and later by Nero's need for a scapegoat after the burning of Rome and of the court intrigues as the mad emperor plans his greatest artistic masterpiece offers something for everyone with its mixture of spectacle, cruelty, piety and perversity to get across its message that selfless love is better than selfish ambition.     MGM's initially troubled 1951 version may have got off to a false start a couple of years earlier when Gregory Peck, Elizabeth Taylor, Walter Huston and John Huston stumbled at the first hurdle when Peck developed an eye infection three days before they were supposed to leave for Rome even though an estimated million dollars had already been spent, but Mervyn Le Roy's recast completed film is still the definitive one. It might have been a couple of years too early for the wide screen, but it's perfectly placed in time between old school morality - no difficult questions asked here - and more sophisticated and lavish filmmaking than had ever been seen before. While the film has its fair share of model shots and matte paintings, the latter even managing to give the illusion of movement thanks to Peter Ellenshaw's ingenuity, its pre-CGI vintage guarantees it a genuine cast of thousands (a young Sophia Loren lost in the crowd of extras in the triumph scene among them) and massive sets with all the artistry Cinecitta's Italian technicians could give it thanks to MGM's almost blank cheque production.     The end result isn't a patch on thelevel of intelligence and maturity that Roman epics like Ben-Hur and Spartacus would bring to the genre less than a decade later, but it's an impressively staged and mostly entertaining big show that, like the novel, provides something for everyone. For the old school there's Robert Taylor's brash and vain conquering general's romance with Deborah Kerr's Christian hostage who constantly befuddles all his arrogant certainties, which dutifully ticks all the clichéd boxes of the genre as he finally Sees The Light and becomes a better person. Taylor's old-fashioned movie star turn is never as wince-inducing as, say, Frederic March's Marcus Superbus in The Sign of the Cross, but he's still effortlessly outmatched by Kerr's sincerity in a thankless role as the good girl with the hots for him while Finlay Currie's sermonising as Peter - complete with reverential tableaux courtesy of Da Vinci - seems more dreary professional than passionate. Much more interesting is the relationship between the cynical poet and courtier Petronius (Leo Genn) and Peter Ustinov's scene-stealing homicidal spoiled brat Nero, as the born survivor uses his wits not to improve matters for the people but to improve his own chances with a kind of bemused detachment before realising the horrifying consequences of all his flattery. Petronius and the slave who loves him (Marina Berti) even get the film's best love theme in Miklos Rozsa's impressive score. All this and Anthony Mann's fire of Rome scene making a decent stab at making the burning of Atlanta look like a backyard bonfire and all the Christians, lions and crucifixions you could want in the arena giving it that essential mixture of piety and exploitation that lets the audience enjoy the carnage and decadence of the bread and circuses as much as their Roman forebears without losing their sense of moral superiority. Nero would have approved - though he would have wanted to change the ending...     It's a handsome looking film and Warner Home Video's restoration mostly does it proud. The film's popularity over the past six decades had taken quite a toll on the original negative, with TV and video prints bleached out and undetailed, but a lot of work has gone into restoring the color and definition to make it look almost as good as it did when it came out. There are a few minor niggles here and there where a patch of green in the wrong place makes its presence felt for a couple of frames (a common problem with early Technicolor) and it's irritating that the DVD is spread over two DVDs with the scene break in the middle of a sequence, but otherwise there's little to complain about (not a problem with the single-disc Bluray, though the picture quality is not a huge upgrade from the DVD). Along with the striking teaser trailer built around a still of the triumph scene that appeared in Life Magazine and the full five-and-a-half minute trailer there's an audio commentary by F.X. Feeney and a 43-minute documentary. Unfortunately there's a real lack of behind the scenes footage, no-one involved in the making of the film participates, and none of the talking heads have researched the film in detail (Richard Schickel in particular feels like he just offered a few soundbites while being interviewed about another film, though Christopher Frayling is typically good value), but it is a decent overview of the genre and its unpopularity with critics and appeal to audiences.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|I'm not a fan of horror flicks but this one was really good.<br /><br />Most horror directors pander to demented individuals who seem to enjoy excessive slash & gore & in the process they ruin what could be truly scary stories. Not so with this film! It was made with just enough violence to get the point across. No cheesy dialog & no dragging out the scenes way beyond what a normal human being cares to see.<br /><br />This movie deals seriously with rape & provides viscerally satisfying endings for each of the perpetrators.<br /><br />Gore lovers will be affected by the extreme tension in this movie but may feel cheated (who cares?)<br /><br />Pros: Read above<br /><br />Cons: Made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable (but I'm OK with that...)<br /><br />I would recommend it to any adult who's looking for a tense evening (except my Mom; she watches Fox News for that.)
B004C4IKCU|4.0|Having had both these treasured LPs for years it was great to get them together on cd in this collection.<br />The sound is greatly improved and one hears a lot that is missing on the records.<br /><br />  Elvis is Back is the main disc...his version of FEVER has alway been outstanding more like Little Willie Johns than Peggy Lee's.  My favorite is The Girl of My Best Friend which was a big singles hit for Elvis soundalike Ral Donner.  It is to Elvis' generosity that he did not release this as a single.  He did the same thing with Suspicion with another soundalke Terry Stafford.  Such a Night was a big international hit, (I heard it on the radio in St Kitts)also not released in the US as a single.<br /><br />  Something for Everybody has a few treasures..amidst a lot of fluff. I  like Gently the best. Many of the cuts are uninteresting ballads.  I tripped I stumbled I fell is a welcome ending.<br /><br />The bonus tracks keep the listener abreast of what hits Elvis released during this period.  One grave omission is Wild in the Country.  I hope to purchase more Elvis cds from Amazaon in the future.
1594481938|1.0|....and I only made it to page 59.  This is the first review I've ever written, but this book was just so bad, and since it's been on the NY Times Best Seller List, I felt compelled to weigh in. I looked up the author, and he seems to have a long list of accolades.  I haven't personally read any of his other stuff, so I have nothing to compare this one too.  But there was also a question out there about him, \\"Is Nick Hornby a talented writer or is he just extremely popular?\\"  That may explain why this book has so many 5 star reviews.  As far as the book goes, I forced myself to read as much as I did, it was so slow, and also a challenge trying to keep track of the four different voices.  Once they all came together on the roof top, that's when the story just seemed so contrived. I was completely unable to lose myself in the story and believe that this could be real.  The final straw for me was the character Jess who I found to be so offensive and unlikable ... so much so that again, it felt totally contrived.  Difficult to believe that any of the other three would actually go with her to find some guy.  At that point I decided life was too short and closed the book (for good).  Unless you really like Nick Hornby and want to contribute to his financial success, I suggest you buy a used copy of this book.....or even better, not read it at all.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is such a cute movie for the whole family!!! I also loved that the day it came out I bought it on here for less the 1/2 of what the stores sell it for that day :).

B004I4H8PO|1.0|Worst packageing design I've ever seen. At first I thought I only got 4 discs because one was wedged so far down<br />in the packaging. It was covered with glue from stem to stern. Another disc also has glue on it.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm sending it back for a replacement.
0810997827|5.0|Getting my second grader to read was a challenge.  No books were able to hold her attention or get her interested enough to finish until this set.  She loves them, can't put them down.  Read the first one in a day, the second was done 2 days later.  We ended out buying all of them, she is on book five now.  She will be happy to reread them a second time.  Highly recommend these books.
1574216988|5.0|Sandy's books are AWESOME and this one does not disappoint.  From the gazillion tangles to the wonderful, easy to read layout, this book is a keeper. Love, love, love it. You must have this book and her other book if you love to tangle!  Great for beginners or advanced tanglers.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Iron Man 2 is a rare gem in the world of sequels. I love this movie and I dare say Iron Man 2 Is equal to thr original. We not only see the personal stuggles of Tony Stark we see how he rises above them. We also get a glimpse of a S.H.E.I.L.D movie. Samuel L Jackson is great as Nick Fury and I hope Scarlet Johanson is part of any further Marvel Comics movies. Her action scenes (although rare) were amazing. Also Gweneth Paltrow gives another great performance. Mickey Rourqe was great as Whiplash. A superb villian. Marvel Comics movies tend to be good if not great. Iron Man 2 keeps the greatness going. Watch carefully and you get a quick look of Captain America's sheild.
B00457X8BC|1.0|Two dimensional characters, predictable plot, tedious attempts at suspense and a lazy, poorly-crafted plot.  A friend recommended Henning Mankell when I asked for suggestions in the spirit of early John LeCarre.  I was looking for psychological depth and an intriguing puzzle whose answer emerges gradually, delivered in first rate prose.  This is Not Not Not that book.  I recommend you look elsewhere (perhaps Alan Furst is the answer - I'm going to try him next).
B004V9K4KM|4.0|I've listened to, or attempted to listen to, quite a few of these biography/memoirs in audio format. Usually I give up on them or force myself to listen to most of them to pass the hours on a long car ride. This is the first one I've listened to all of. Well, almost all of. Tina Fey is without a doubt a gifted comedic writer and actress. I enjoy '30 Rock', and enjoyed her time with S.N.L. and her other work. She has a clever, insightful, and humorous way of looking at life. I recommend listening to the audio version because you get the benefit of her acting ability and some great voice influction and special additions to the book unique to the audio version such as hearing some actual material from S.N.L. skits.     There were only two portions of her book I have any criticism for. The first, as the other reviewer here also noted is the section in which she describes being photographed for magazines. This portion is just too long. I sense a certain humility in Tina, in which she is trying to tell the listener that she is not a Hollywood Super Star and is really still part of us non-celebrities. I've seen some of her magazine photos and I understand when she describes how they tweek the actual image, I just don't need this much information on the subject. This was the one portion of the CD's that I finally pushed the next chapter button on. The other minor criticism, would be concerning the time spent mentioning Alec Baldwin. I get it that she feels fortunate to have him on '30 Rock.' There is a bit too much repitition of just how fortunate she feels for this and how great she thinks he is.      I enjoyed hearing of her growing up, describing her father, her years with Second City and beginning at S.N.L. and trying to get '30 Rock' off the ground. I was laughing out-loud at times, and impressed at other times by her insightful gift for finding the humor in mundane everyday moments. Tina is a true talent and this audio biography should only help demonstrate that. I hope she continues to write and act for many years to make us laugh and maybe in 20 or 30 years she'll treat us to part two of her biography.
031261246X|5.0|Zero Day took me by surprise.  I say this because I was a bit worrisome knowing that it was written by someone who hasn't made a career out of writing, instead, being a software engineer genius.  I'm not a *avid* reader and often authors with years of experience have trouble hooking me - not MarkRuss.<br /><br />This book was very compelling from the start.  In short, it hooked me early and kept me intrigued.  The devastation sitting out there for the taking and the fact that so many talented individuals (like Mark) can be challenged through deeply complex rootkits doesn't leave one with a happy-go-lucky opinion of our technology future.  As a story, it was great - reality though is scary as heck!<br /><br />MarkRuss did a great job of building the characters in the book and making them real.  It was more than just a story about malware, and it's potential devastation, but one that had heartache, personal relationships, and a set of bad \\"dudes\\" - scary just how much \\"we\\" the west are hated!  The added bonus is that Mark takes you to many different places in the world ensuring that he pretty much touched most major continents in some form keeping the reader on it's toes as you move around the world chasing the bots.<br /><br />Zero Day is a book that I've recommended in person multiple times to individuals and I can't stress enough that for someone with no previous releases, MarkRuss certainly has a career outside of technology if you so chooses.  For now, though, I hope he sticks with us... (Microsoft)<br /><br />Enjoyed it immensly!
B004KPLVV8|5.0|A throw back movie to be sure, but fun to watch.  Takes you back to a different computer age.  If looking for a \\"classic\\", this is not it.  The animation is questionable.  However, it was the base for lots of computer games that those of us who played at the time, remember well.  So fun from a historical view.  If on the cutting edge and no memories for you, then not the movie to see.
B000I0QLZU|2.0|I've been loading up on big, dumb action movies on blu-ray, so when I saw this on sale for $10.99, I said why not...  I popped the disc in, and was horrified at the picture quality- it looks like an upconverted dvd.  If you have this on dvd already, then don't waste your money.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Just more of the same puzzles.  Different graphics for the UI is the only difference.  Nothing special at all, stick with free version if you want it
B0041KKYCY|3.0|Generally, remakes are never as good as the original and this one is no exception.  This new version seems to have more gratuitous nudity and violence than the original (and that is not an easy thing to do) yet it is worth seeing if you are a fan of the original.  If you find the subject matter revolting, then just stay away.  This movie is not for you.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Hi Nicole,           As promised here is my review of Elena Undone ;) I am 46 years old have seen lots of lesbian movies in this time  and found this movie to be real genuine and believable. I know these women were acting but I sensed they had incredible chemistry for each other which made it so much more real and enjoyable for me. It was finally nice to see a happy ending in a lesbian movie as well. I know not everyone believes in soulmates and the twin flame concept but I do even though I have not found my twin flame and have started given up in ever doing so but this movie gave me a sense of hope back so thank you for that. I have rewatched this movie several times can't seem to get enough truly especially of Necar's role I think she did a phenominal performance. I recommend this movie to be seen by anyone and everyone who believes love exists and can last ;) Thanks for a truly wonderful movie Nicole.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I read the book and saw the movie and both were great. There were a few small changes in movie when comparing it to the book, but nothing that hurt the story line. I thought the movie makers did a great job filming a difficult book to put on the movie screen. The acting was good and the action and special effects were the best. The story-line is like a fantasy, science fiction, action movie. I believe there is suppose to be six books to this book series and I hope each book becomes a movie. I loved this movie and the book \\"I AM NUMBER FOUR\\" and can't wait for the next book \\"THE POWER OF SIX\\" to come out in late August 2011 and I hope they make a movie out of that book too! If you like any kind of fantasy, science fiction, or action story, then you'll love this movie. I would recommend reading the book first then watching the movie. The book does go into more background and detail that the movie wasn't able to, but they still did a great job bringing this book to life in this movie. I recommend both the book series and the movie.
4789004546|4.0|At my stage of learning, I'd have preferred if the romanised sentences were in Hiragana and Katakana. This is because I can't yet read kanji well enough and need practise reading in Japanese. Once I can read enough kanji the book will be more fun. It's a very technical looking book which certainly has its uses though when I first got it it was pretty scary. However as time goes on I realise it's stuffed with info, you just have to give it some time. Why they used romanised Japenese I don't know. It's easy enough to learn Hiragana and katakana so why not just assume this has been done? I guess they have their reasons - after all I am but a mere beginner though my teacher advised me to get away from romanised straight away as it apparently hinders your progress.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Amazing app. Love the built in sleep timer and in app alarm clock. Now I can go to sleep and wake up listening to my favorite radio stations. Also let's you record straight from app, and has DVR type feature that allows you to rewind streaming audio. Five stars.
B0036UMM84|4.0|I remember when this came out in the late 70s, it seemed like an alright movie then, I even remember Elvis was suppose to play the supporting role. After watching it again in 2011, I now remember how wrong the 70s were and why we are so screwed up now. This movie is a symbolic time capsual. This would have been a degrade for Elvis, apparently he degraded on his own. This movie is an example of what we no longer tolerate because we just don't care anymore. And Gary Busey still had a brain in this one.
044654759X|5.0|This book is amazing! You will not want to put it down. I did not read the description before I started reading and was entranced the entire time. This book has a darker side to it. It still has a love element but Sparks takes you into the mind/thoughts of one character that is menacing. You really feel for each character and want to continue reading to know what happens. A must read for any Nicholas Sparks fan. It truly is wonderful!!!!!!
B004TE6F66|5.0|Linger is the second in a series of three novels by Maggie Stiefvater, the first being Shiver and the third, Forever, is to be released in July of 2011.<br /><br />This second novel begins with Sam and Grace being rewarded for their drastic actions taken to save Sam in Shiver.

He will wait to find her and also seek to find the true cure that will save his friends, his love, and himself from an early death.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Harry Potter is awesome! This movie is spell bounding! I have seen it 3 times and notice something new each time. This film is much darker than the previous movies. It absolutely answers questions one may have regarding the story. A must see for any Harry Potter fan!
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|I'm impressed with the quality of graphics and gameplay and options that are available. this is a great app. amazingly you can play against other people online or right next to you on their own phone
B00011RPB0|5.0|You have to like quiet movies to love this one but it's a masterpiece. The cinematography in Japan alone is worth the price of admission but Bill Murray has never been better-- no not even in Groundhogs Day, another first rate film-- and his young co-star is equally wonderful. It's a tender true story of what can happen when two strangers connect in an unlikely place and time, an improbable and unconsummated love story with a great mysterious ending. (what does he whisper to her?) Beautiful to watch. Must see.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in this product. Biggest problem was with \\"installation\\". The instructions are comically bad -  tiny print, rudimentary drawings, confusing references to the multiple elements of the install package, and so on. I tried my best to follow them, but then the cover film itself didn't come off its backing like it was supposed to - making alignment and application almost impossible. Ended up with bubbles and streaks. I pulled it off and threw it away. You can get far cheaper protectors that will work just as well and aren't as maddening to apply, which is what I ended up doing.

B004NSULHM|2.0|And here we have Radiohead's first, truly mediocre album; it was a rushed effort and you can tell the second you put it on.  The mixing sounds terrible, the loops and drums are so uninspiring because they repeat endlessly on most of the songs, and the best songs that Yorke had previewed during his solo tours are not even on the album.  What a disappointment.  On top of all of this, there are only eight songs after the fans have waited for three years for a new release.    The only saving graces here are \\"Lotus Flower\\" and \\"Codex\\".

B004DWKO8Y|1.0|\\"What If?\\"  Indeed...  I never have been a fan of Mr. Big, despite the obvious talent of the blokes who comprise this band.  No doubt Eric Martin has a good voice and Billy Sheehan is one talented bassist (just check out his playing on the first 2 David Lee Roth solo albums for example), and Paul Gilbert's Racer X stuff isn't bad at all either, but Mr. Big just never did it for me and this album does nothing to change that.  Fans of the band will disagree with my review and that's fair enough, everyone is entitled to their opinion and here's mine - like it or not.<br /><br />The best song on the album is undoubtedly the opening track \\"Undertow\\" but even this is nothing special.  Yes the guitars (especially the bass) are very Van Halen-esque but it's nowhere near as good a song as just about any Van Halen tune.  It's just the best of what I can only describe on this album as a collection of very bland, quite often lame to insipid songs.  After the opening tune things fall away pretty quickly with the second track \\"American Beauty\\".  The slower paced track three \\"Stranger In My Life\\" isn't bad, but again really nothing that good either.  Yet it's way better than the god-awful two tracks that follow in \\"Nobody Left To Blame\\" and \\"Still Ain't Enough For Me\\".  Then things only get marginally better with the following two tracks \\"Once Upon A Time\\" and \\"As Far As I Can See\\" because at least they do have a bit of a harder edge.  Next in the track list is a pathetically boring, lame, soppy, semi-pop crap song \\"All The Way Up\\", but at least the title is appropriate as the song does indeed cause the contents of my stomach to come all the way up.  \\"I Won't Get In My Way\\" follows and this rocks about as hard as the opening the track and would be the second best song on the album.  This one sounds a bit Bon Jovi-esque, as does track 11 \\"I Get The Feeling\\" but again these just aren't as good as just about any Bon Jovi tune you care to name.  The album should have ended there but unfortunately I have the version with a bonus track so I had to suffer through one more song which I really could have done without because it's not really worth having.  In fact it wouldn't matter how many bonus tracks they threw on this album, it wouldn't make it good.<br /><br />I tried to give this album fair playing time before writing this review, to see if it would grow on me but I really would have better spent the time scratching my a#s, removing navel lint or picking my toe nails.  And yes I could still do those things while listening to this album, by why should I make those experiences unpleasant?<br /><br />What If this was a good album? Well for me the cover says it all.  This is one of the worst albums I've listened to in a long time, and should only be recommended to fans of the band because I expect that they are just about the only people who will enjoy it.  I just can't see them winning many new fans with this stuff.nfortunately I have the version with a bonus track so I had to suffer through one more song which I really could have done without because it's not really worth having.

B002RN5I3M|4.0|Some of the themes were similar, but I don't think it quite lived up to Pillars.  Worth the read though.  Hoping the Century trilogy is Follett at his best again!
B004G6009K|5.0|I loved the movie along with the rest of my family! We are happy we bought the 4 disc copy even though we do not have a 3D tv just yet. For a few more dollars, it seems worth getting the digital copy along with a 3d copy. In today's world 3D is the future, and if our tv goes out in the next couple years we'll be buying a 3D system! Just thinking ahead!<br /><br />Movie is very cute! Mandy and Zach are a great team as our leading \\"couple\\". For all ages!
B004A8ZX28|5.0|\\"Unknown\\" is a professional thriller that features an intriguing storytelling, intense and high tension actions scenes, speedy car chases in the beautiful Berlin and one remarkable performance by an actor that outshines the rest.<br /><br />In this special case, even a short plot summery might ruin the experience.<br />What can be said is that the story revolves around the efforts of Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) to reclaim his life after being involved in a car accident and the difficulties he faces doing so.<br />In the process, he meets with a few people who try to help; one of them is Ernst J&uuml;rgen - played by Bruno Ganz - who gives no short of an Oscar worthy performance. Ganz portrays the character of a veteran Stasi operative, now a detective for hire, who manages to steal every scene he takes part in. The viewer can just marvel at the skill, expertise and emotion that are rarely seen in action-packed movies.<br /><br />In all, \\"Unknown\\" is entertainment at its best.
0316286850|5.0|As a cosmetologist that has also learned to do makeup I must say that Kevyn Aucoin's books Making Faces and Face Forward are great for learning more techniques in the application of makeup.  In school we actually had access to his Making Faces book to learn from and found him to be a genius at makeup application!  The step by step instruction is very helpful and I have used several of his techniques for looks other than my same ol' look.  I own both of his books and use techniques from both of them.  Anyone who is looking for new looks with their makeup look no further than Kevyn Aucoin; he definately will not disappoint!

It is funnny, sad and uplifting all at the same time.  There is one scene (just after she leaves the tower) that i can't get enough off, I keep watching it over and over again :) This movie is great family fun, just make sure you're there tto watch it with your children because it does have some scenes that might need to be explained to the younger ones.
1594202842|4.0|I'm not going to write a review debating author Amy Chua's child-raising methods....that's just silly.  Her morals, values and child-raising theories are her own and she's entitled to them.<br /><br />But referring to the book itself, I have to say Amy has a delightful sense of humor.  It's been a long time since I found myself laughing out loud while reading a book (other people look at you funny) and I think I laughed almost continuously throughout her memoir.<br /><br />Whether you agree with her methods or not (for the record: I think she was right in a lot of ways and she certainly has more stamina than I do to be able to consistently implement them), her memories of trying to raise her children in the Western culture using Chinese principles is an engaging and thought-provoking read.<br /><br />Yes, it's created a lot of controversy, mostly by people who like to tell other people how to raise their kids, but if you read it with an eye for seeing the humor in it all, this is a great memoir and I highly recommend it.

B004YSDU9C|4.0|Big fan of the Doctor here- boy are the writers cramming in the story lines! The doctor is still dead, Aimee is pregnant, her daughter is a time lord, River Song's relationship with the doctor unfolds and Canton wants to marry a black guy. It's the x-files meets the soaps. The doctor is saved by the supporting cast too often and he bumbles way to much. Doctor Who continues to promote homosexuality- what for? Is it supposed to edgy? The show is just as good with the references to sexual politics isn't it? Best line from this episode? \\"Cuz look at me, I'm confident. You wanna watch that in me, when I'm confident\\".
B002MAQSJ8|3.0|Its over 540 pages long, so its at least twice as long as most books.  Sometimes it had way too much dialogue that it read like a movie script.  Its not that easy to read.  There is A TON OF PEOPLE to keep track of and i would forget who's who.  At the beginning of the book all the characters are listed under the companies they worked for....many characters and several companies.......if the authors have to do this, you know its going to be confusing.  Occasionally, there is a note at the bottom of a page saying a certain person had a different point of view. I wanted to read about the LBO deal but the first half of the book went into great detail about the careers and lives of many of the different people involved in the deal.  All this made the story too boring.  I yawned a lot while reading this book.      Overall, the story is not what i would call \\"exciting\\", but it is interesting and a little funny at times.  I did get a good idea of how the bidding process works and what its like to deal with committees and a board of directors.  I understand how an LBO works now.  There are many pictures in this book, which is good if you like that.  I think it would have been a much better story if there was less dialogue and less detail about so many different people.  Other than being too boring with details, it is a good story.    I recommend this book if you like 80's finance, LBO's or Nabisco/RJR Tobacco.
0060922583|5.0|I've read many books on quantum physics and Michael Talbot's Holotropic Universe is by far the most understandable to date.  His book is well documented from a diverse and well-known group of doctors, scientists, psychotherapists,etc. who are experts in their respective fields.  The book includes a lengthy bibliography.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a scientific explanation for Psychic Phenomena, healing, as well as a viable theory of the invisible energies of God and the Universe.  Michelle Lindey.
B004CRR9G0|4.0|This review is of the Disney Blu-Ray release of NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF WIND.<br /><br />Disney has blown the doors off with this wonderful transfer of a somewhat-obscure Miyazaki animated classic.  Many will point to the refinement in animation of latter Miyazaki works, but if you are a fan of that hardcore CASTLE IN THE SKY fantasy style then this one is a real gem.  This film is as concerned with ecology as POM POKO but is full of adventure and political intrigue.  The female lead is an outright super-heroine.  I would have paid the full $40, but with the discounted Amazon price I found this to be a no-brainer.  Truly beautiful.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|This is a great value for any Beatles fan. I loved the lobby cards and the movie poster. The original script is fun to read through cause it includes dialogue that was cut from the movie. All together a great collectible for any Beatles fan and at a great price.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I wore out my D300 Nikon using an SB-600 and SB-800. When I upgraded to the D300s was hesitant to spend the extra money for this flash. The next day I shot an event, and w/just minor perusing of the instruction booklet, I shot spot on pictures exposure wise using the diffusor cap, in a very large hall w/no ceilng to bounce the flash off of. I was amazed!     Not gonna go into all the tech stuff, but I was prepared to have a learning curve period, and was amazed at how efficient and accurate the new D300s and and this flash work together!     Next up, use it as a master unit to trigger the SB-800 for backlight and aux. side lighting. Look forward to as good of results doing this! Thank You Nikon!

0316098337|5.0|I bought this book because it was chosen for our bookclub by the host last month. I have to say at the begining I thought it was going to be really hard to get through and I did not like it at all. I kept it in the car and at Dr's appts or while waiting for my son read a few pages here and there. After about 20 or 30 pages though I was totally into it wanting to find out what would happen next. It is not very long and an easy read but some people will have a hard time getting into it. My advice is stick to it and you will be glad you did!
B000OLGCI4|3.0|Admittedly, I liked the Jungle Book as a kid.  It had cute characters, catchy songs, and of course, the Disney label.  However, after having re-read Kipling's classic, I can not say that this film is true to the original story.  The characters, most notably Baloo, the elephant army, and Kaa, have lost their nobility, and have come off as buffoonish.  Then, too, there is no talk of \\"the laws of the jungle,\\" which was so important to the original story.  Finally, Mowgli's original conflict is diminished.  In the Kipling stories, Mowgli returns to the man-village because the wolf-pack, led by outsider Shere Khan, has turned on him.  It's a cute movie, but in the end, it won't be joining my collection.

0307712508|5.0|Brief Description: This is a multi-layered book that tells three interconnected and equally fascinating stories. First, we have the history of HeLa cells--the first immortal human cells grown in culture that led to countless medical breakthroughs (including the polio vaccine). The HeLa cells are still alive today and used in research labs across the globe. Second, we have the story of Henrietta Lacks--the African American woman whose unwitting donation of the HeLa cells was unknown to her family for more than 20 years after her death at age 31 of cervical cancer. Third, we have the story of the author, Rebecca Skloot, attempting to write this book and getting to know the Lacks family, in particular Henrietta's daughter Deborah. Their unlikely friendship and discovery of Henrietta's story forms the living heart of this book and helps it to transcend being \\"just another non-fiction book.\\"<br /><br />My Thoughts: I'd heard so many positive things about this book that it broke down my initial reluctance to read it. I didn't think I was all that interested in tissue culture, and I don't gravitate to biographies as a rule (especially for people I've never heard of before). Boy, am I glad I listened to everyone who raved about this book! Skloot manages to weave the three stories together in a way that was fascinating, heart-breaking, educational and involving. I discovered that I cared very much about issues related to tissue culture. I also got caught up in what Skloot went through to tell Henrietta's story. And my heart broke for Henrietta and her family, whose challenges in life were considerable and yet were borne with dignity and grace. This is non-fiction writing at its finest.<br /><br />About the Audio: Cassandra Campbell is the primary narrator and does a wonderful job. This was a long listen, and yet I never grew tired of listening to her voice or the story. My version included an interview with the author at the end, which was a real treat (even though it threw me off that she didn't sound like Cassandra Campbell, who I had begun to think of as Rebecca Skloot!)didn't sound like Cassandra Campbell, who I had begun to think of as Rebecca Skloot!)

B002TLSSXO|5.0|This is a fantastic product.  The handles not only keep the utensils off the counter top but also help them to rest on the edge of pots and pans.  The handles are easy to grip and, despite their \\"funky\\" appearance, the shape of the tools actually makes them easier to use.  The spatulas are nice and thin so the get under fragile foods like eggs without breaking them up.  My husband, who HATES change, absolutely loves these.  Everyone comments on how attractive they are too.  We'd give these 10 stars if we could.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is the first game I suggest to play when it's \\"game time\\". I love it! Very mind engaging, yet my 4 yr old sometimes gets lucky and wins. Yes, you can get lucky, or you can really use your noodle and strategically plan on how to place each piece. Either way, this game is a winner in our family. The only downfall is that only 4 people (max) can play. Sometimes you have to wait your turn.

B004VD3PE0|5.0|The happy opening scene of If I Stay - filled with pancakes and banter and a lovingly flawed family - is made even more poignant by the sense of foreboding that shadows it. Mia narrates the book in a present-tense style that interweaves flashbacks with current-day scenes. Flashbacks are tricky creatures, prone to tedium; here, they not only expand readers' understanding of the characters, but also feel integral to the plot, such as it is.     The complexities of Mia's family members and friends are explored with a compassion that inevitably evokes tears and, occasionally, laughter. Mia's boyfriend Adam should be a cliché - the good-looking, effortlessly cool rocker-musician who falls for the shy cellist - but their relationship feels earnest and mature.    The side-themes of finding one's identity and growing up, explored through Mia's parents, are as thought-provoking as the core story. Life and death, love and loss, rock and classical music - these dichotomies are touched on through Mia's flashbacks in a way that emphasizes the choice she must make between two un-choosable alternatives. If I Stay epitomizes the phrase \\"a life in the balance.\\" With raw emotion, Mia equally weighs both of her options before the scales are tipped in one direction.    The most profound books make readers consider their own lives, and Mia's journey can't help but incite questions about one's choices, both tiny and potentially life-changing. If I Stay is not a book to be read halfheartedly. It is a consuming and haunting story that warrants all the tears readers have no doubt shed over its pages.

B003KGBIRK|5.0|I won't review \\"Videodrome\\" itself because, if you're thinking about orderind the DVD, you've probably already seen it and you now what you're getting into.      The included items and features are about as good as it gets for an old movie.  You get plenty of behind-the-scenes features, not one but two audio commentaries, one includes both Debrah Harry and James Woods.  You get a nice, thick booklet.  And, the video/audio quality is first-rate.    So, if you like the movie (or are just still trying to figure it out), you want this package.  It's quite complete and well done.

6305907145|1.0|Just finished watching this movie and I wish I had the time back.  This was so not what I was expecting or hoping for in an adaptation of an Austen novel.  I've read the book and the characters are completely altered from the book that Jane Austen wrote; Lady Bertram is a junkie, Sir Thomas is disturbingly lecherous and there is no mention at all of William.  So many liberties were taken with the story that I found myself saying over and over again \\"That wasn't in the book AT ALL\\".  Fanny never accepted Crawford's proposal in the book, the whole outing to Mr. Rushford's estate was omitted from the film and the relationship between Fanny and her brother William is totally missing because I guess William doesn't exist in the movie.    I admit that Mansfield Park isn't my favorite of the Austen novels but it deserved a better treatment than it got in the movie.  At least I borrowed it from the library and I am not out any money.    If you loved or even tolerated the book, I believe you will be disappointed by this film version.  What a waste of time.

B0040QYROK|5.0|Metropolis is a film as fresh and relevant as any of today's cinema, and a lot more interesting than most! This '5' star review isn't to suggest that after 84 years and numerous edits, losses and attempts at restoration, Metropolis is in perfect condition.  But much of the long (and believed, forever) lost footage--nearly 20% of Lang's original version--has been found and restored from VERY damaged 16mm stock; and it's inclusion is stunning in its overall effect on the storytelling and visual impact of the film.  And on Blu-ray it looks as good as one could ever imagine considering the history it's survived.  This is the result of decades of dedicated film 'sleuthery' and the efforts of film preservationists and restorationists from around the world.  In short.......METROPOLIS IS A CINEMATIC TREASURE!
0385340540|1.0|I've read about 10 of Grisham's novel and this is one of the worst. This probably should have been one of Frommer's Guide to Italy instead of novel. What a waste of time. 3 days of my life I won't get back.
0205632645|4.0|Even people who haven't read through this book should know that it's the de facto manual for improving your writing.  The information it contains is just as relevant today as when it was written.<br /><br />Since the content of the book isn't any different this time around, let's talk about the edition itself.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, this is a very attractive edition of The Elements of Style.  Embossed lettering and a leatherette cover definitely make for a fancier copy than the basic soft and hardcover editions.  Inside, it's beautifully printed with an easy-to-see contrast between paper and ink.<br /><br />The biggest issue with this edition for me is how flimsy the paper is.  This is essentially a reference book, but the paper's thinness makes me think it won't hold up to being thumbed through over time.<br /><br />This would make a nice gift for a budding writer, or look good on a shelf if you don't plan to consult it often.  For college students, professional writers or anyone else who might get heavy use out of The Elements of Style, go for one of the oversized paperbacks with the thick paper instead.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Simply amazing. No need to hesitate on whether or not you should buy this product. It really is a breathtaking experience, especially with Sir David Attenborough narrating!
B003XT603Q|5.0|This book is Fantastic.  It's the first Murakami book I've read and I'm completely in love.<br /><br />The story is about a young man who is in love with a troubled girl.  Only, of course, it's never that simple.<br /><br />Tokyo was never this real when I visited there as tourist.  Norwegian Wood offers a window on a whole different world that I never even knew existed.<br /><br />Something about the narrator feels so much more honest than characters in other books.  It's like I can really trust the way he sees the world; this creates a strange feeling of comfort and discomfort at the same time which really adds to the story.<br /><br />All in all, I find it difficult to describe this book, but there is a feeling in this book that reminds me of a British novel I read a long, long time ago; set in a similar time with the protagonist working in a record shop... The story is different, but the feeling of trying to find one's place in the world and being confused by the realities of love are there in both stories.<br /><br />The Kindle version of this book is top notch: interactive menu and one can easily navigate between chapters using the 5 way controller.  As far as I can tell there are no textual errors.  One request for the future is: please offer different English translations of this book on Kindle (one of the other reviews mentions that there is at least one other translation).  I would love to read this book again with the interpretations of a different translator.  I'm not saying there is anything wrong with this version - it's fantastic - but it's always fun to read the same story translated different ways.

B004EPYZZI|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I was really into the story of Bethany after her shark attack so I'm glad that they made this movie about her. I think the entire cast did amazingly well with this project. This is a very inspirational movie and it just shows you that you can do anything. I really loved how they had the video footage and pictures at the end of the movie of Bethany after the shark attack with her achievements. AnnaSophia Robb did an amazing job portraying Bethany Hamilton. You can really tell that AnnaSophia spent some time with Bethany before this movie was made because she could not of been more believable throughout the movie. This movie will give you a new insight into life in general and into Bethany's life. Be forwarned you will shed a few tears in this movie. I really do not cry over movies but Soul Surfer had me shedding some tears. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a really long time. This is truly an amazing family movie. I will be buying this movie when it comes out, no doubt. It just goes to show you that GOD really works in mysterious ways!!! Bethany Hamilton is truly an amazing person and so is her family and friends!

B004BLJQOK|2.0|Can anyone tell me what the point is of copying another movie almost verbatim, scene for scene?  They're calling \\"Let Me In\\" a remake of [[ASIN:B001MYIXAC Let The Right One In]], but shouldn't a remake have a slightly different feel or tone to it?  Let Me In is simply a talented film school exercise.
1401924352|4.0|Unique cover design. Once you actually get into the book, it's pretty inspiring and gives you a positive outlook on life. I enjoyed the quotes, insight on Miranda's personal experiences, and even the photos of her family and the inspiring people in her life. I definitely don't regret ordering it. The only negatives would be that (1) at times it was a little repetitive and (2) some of the metaphors were a little hokey for me.

B001N26GFM|5.0|Not to spoil this wonderful moving story but after growing up with a substantial Jewish population in my neighborhood and seeing that number tattoo on so many arms and having an anti semetic father this film shows how a Nazi officer takes a promotion to the countryside to run a concentration camp with his family.Naturally the children miss all friends in the city and the family is told by the father that it is a \\"work farm\\" after the son spies it from a window and asks.He later sneaks away to the farm and meets a boy through the fence in Striped Pajamas.Living in such a remote and rural area the Commanders family lives in a house that is too far from school and is guarded around the clock with labor camp prisoners doing menial tasks on the property.The boy starts sneaking to the camp and develops a friendship with the other boy in the striped pajamas like any young boys do.They sit and talk, read through the fence in a blind spot arrange for lack of a better term play dates.The boy in the striped pajamas never reveals what really happens when the showers happen.The commanders father has no knowledge of his sons friendship or the fact he smuggles food over to his secret friend.As the commanders son want's to go into the camp and help his friend do his chores really fast so they can play together without the fence between him.They are determined to have fun after he can leave the farm, all the while keeping the secret.The Mother becomes sympathetic towards the workers who come to visit but must not be seen performing random acts of kindness in Hitlers Germany.So many friends have borrowed this DVD from me and purchased it themselves.
B004L3AQLU|5.0|A great movie to watch with grandma and the little tykes.<br /><br />Just kidding. Don't rent films blindly. Consult Common Sense Media before watching. This is what they said about this execrable bit of trash:<br /><br />\\"Jamie is a serial seducer who has sex with several different women -- and sometimes multiple partners. He falls in love with Maggie and has sex with her many times. Viewers see Jamie naked from head to foot (buttocks are shown, but no genitalia); Maggie is also naked several times (breasts are shown). Other minor female characters are seen in various stages of nudity. There's kissing, clothes being ripped off, suggestions of oral sex, minor thrusting, orgasmic moaning, and couples lying in bed (or on the floor) after sex. Also strong, constant sex talk, including conversations about Viagara and erections.\\"<br /><br />Don't kid yourself. This is what passes for romantic comedy now, and impressionable young people are being taught how to live by drinking deep of this effluent. Hey, you've got to hand it to Hollywood---they really know how to stick with their agenda. What is it? Watch what they produce and see.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I love this app. It's useful, it's well implemented, and it makes life simpler.  My one complaint was just fixed with an update.  This app is my absolute favorite calendar app.  It has a slick interface, fluid design, smart views, and now a scroll-able agenda widget.<br /><br />It may sound strange but this is one of my favorite apps because of the beautiful integration with Google calendar and unmatched presentation<br /><br />Best Features:<br /><br />* Customize-able week view, all with one simple swipe<br />* Customize-able agenda widget<br />* Total control of what calendars to display<br />* Works with Google's two step verification/application specific codes<br />* Searchable calendars<br />* Many options<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* None!  The only one I had has been resolved via an update.

B004EPYZQM|4.0|Just got out of the theater & I must say- This movie ROCKS!!!  Great Plot/Story Line... A lot better than the last 3...  This movie is full of Thrills, Action, Drama & great sound!!!  The special effects are AWESOME, but not too over the top!!!  It was a Huge Bonus bringing the Originals back!!!  All of the original actors fit their roles perfectly & the Dwaye Johnson fit his new role great! He added a lot of Intensity & his usual Flair... He also brought extra action in a Fantastic Fight scene with Deisel... Muscle vs Muscle!!!    There is some Racing like usual, but this installment has a lot better story & is more of COMPLETE movie...  Paul Walker & Diesel didn't miss a beat with there on screen chemistry like they had in the First movie in the series!    The Chase Scene at the end of the movie is the BEST CHASE SCENE since The Elanor Chase Scene in the Gone In Sixty Seconds movie with N.Cage!    Also, just like usual many people left when the end credits came on, but if you stay through the credits,  you will be rewarded with a nice little SURPRISE!!!    I give this movie an A & would recommend going to see it on the Big Screen!!!  I might just go and see it again!!!    Thanks for reading my review!
0061726826|5.0|by Victoria Testa<br /><br />I ran out the second I heard that Delirium was released. A huge fan of Before I Fall, I could not wait to read Lauren Oliver's newest novel. I was instantly hooked by the concept and tore through the book the second it was in my hands. Truly, it did not disappoint. The only disappointment I felt is that I never wanted it to end.<br /><br />Imagine a world without love. A world without hugs, kisses, smiling couples, or awkward first dates. These imaginings are a reality for the people of America in a not-so-distant future. The government diagnoses love, and all the trauma it causes, as a disease that must be cured. Lena knows all too well what this disease can do. She saw it eat away at her mother's soul like a parasite. She saw firsthand that love doesn't just hurt...it kills.<br /><br />Lena can't wait to be cured, to be forever saved from the same fate her mother suffered. Yet, one chance meeting changes everything. A mysterious boy enters her life, promising to teach her how to live, maybe even to love. As Lena's carefully constructed life starts making a downward spiral into oblivion, she must decide between the life she has always wanted and the life she never knew existed.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver is an absolute genius. My copy of Delirium is dog-eared all over the place to mark particularly beautiful parts in her prose. I was halfway through when I realized that I had dog-eared practically every page. Her style is so exquisitely heart wrenching and powerful that no number of adjectives can portray the beauty of her words.<br /><br />The characters are impeccably crafted. Their dialogue is so natural that I felt like I was being sucked into their conversations. Lena is one of my favorite heroines in modern young adult literature. She is not a born hero or a true fighter. She is vulnerable, and that is one of her most powerful traits. She embodies the moments of doubt, wonder, and fear that everyone experiences at some point. Yet, as she looks deeply into herself, she realizes that she isn't strange or weak. Lena finds that power within herself and her journey  inspires readers.<br /><br />Although Delirium by Lauren Oliver takes place in a distant time, is the idea so far reaching? Are people really willing to give up love to end war, hatred, and violence? Is it worth it? Maybe yes, maybe no. The answer is different for every person. Delirium begs the question: Why do you have to choose? Why can't peace and love coexist in the same world? It is a question that will stay with the reader long after the final page of this glorious novel. No matter what consequences befall me for admitting this, I absolutely, positively, without a shadow of a doubt, love this book to madness. And delirium has never felt this good.lizes that she isn't strange or weak. Lena finds that power within herself and her journey  inspires readers.

B002ZG9800|5.0|This is quite simply a love story!---A funny, quirky, original, and unorthodox one,   mind you...But a love story nonetheless! (-:  I F--ing love this movie!   Jim Carrey gives an amazingly kinetic and manic performance as a conman whose life is filled with twists,   turns, misfortunes, reckonings, lies, cons & clever scams, love and truth.   His character is anything but boring though, and yes, is based on real life people and events.  Ewan McGregor is equally brilliant as the blonde-haired, doe-eyed, southern-accented voice of   conscious and reason; not to mention, the apple of Jim Carrey's characters eye....Phillip Morris.  I'm not going to go into a blow by blow (so to speak) of everything that happens in this movie,  but it's one of the most daring and unique films I've seen in a long time.   I rented it first, but defintely will be buying it to add it to my collection in the very near future.  5 Stars easily, in my book! (-:

Of course not all things are added from the book onto the movie but they/producers chose the best parts of them and created a masterpiece.     I keep watching this  over and over again!

B00004YC2F|5.0|Quite simply, this is with NO exceptions the finest rendition I believe to be available today.    Volodos, a titan at the keyboard, appears unable to play wrong notes. In this (live!) performance there may  be only one place where he perhaps misplays (but this is not easy to spot, and I won't bore anyone with the location)    The performance is uncanny: thoroughly Russian, as it should be; breathtakingly fast; supremely accurate; in  impeccable taste throughout, and let me say again, live.  The Berlin audience, who have seen and heard everything, are not easily roused: the cheer at the end is enough  to stun! This is playing of a truly sublime nature, and so rare.    Some have criticised this performance for its accuracy - this is strange, for are we to applaud mistakes? The  Argerich version has enough inaccuracies to keep anybody happy; if this is what is wished for I recommend it highly.    In the history of performance their have been players who have taken such control of particular pieces that they  have seemed to have 'owned' them. I would venture that this is exactly that. Some footsteps are hard to follow, but  these may as well be cast in stone.    Recording quality is viscerally real (no coughs, praise be to the engineers), performance quality is absolute.    Bravissimo Maestro Volodos! I bow to you.

B000002HMH|4.0|Hi,    I got this album a while ago, back when it first came out, and i'd agree with most 1 and 2 star reviews that it was a horrible album.  But over the years I've come to like it a lot.  With songs like \\"King Nothing\\", \\"Until it Sleeps\\", and \\"Ronnie\\", I don't see how people cant like this album.  I'm an old-school fan of Metallica, I have Kill Em' All on Vinyl, and it's a great album, and i think that \\"Load\\" is a great addition to my collection, and it fits along with every other 'tallica album.    In conclusion, It's a pretty good album, so i'd recommend it to any metallica fan who doesn't care if they've changed over the years, Metallica is one of the greatest metal bands in the world, and it'd be a shame not to have All of their albums to listen to all of their great songs.    -Walt
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Note: Younger Readers cautioned due to Violence.<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br />I read the first two books before Mockingjay had released(approximately 5 months before it released) .Before I say anything else I would advise you to read this book ONLY. Catching Fire is pretty good but doesn't hold even a candle near The Hunger Games and Mockingjay is just ...*SHUDDERS*<br /><br />(Note: This review was written for a school project so it might be a little different from my usual reviews)<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a fresh story set in an alternate reality,which seems so much like our own.This book has the potential to become an all time classic due to it's fresh and engrossing narrative.<br /><br />The Hunger Games follows Katniss Everdeen as she selflessly takes the place of her younger sister in the 75th Annual Hunger Games.This is an annual ritual or ceremony in which two children from each of the 13 districts are put against one another and the last one standing...wins.The children do not have a choice.If you are chosen you fight or die.<br /><br />I really liked this book.It has a gruesome and mature theme but that is what sets it apart from others.This book is a fine example of dystopian fiction.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is a very strong female protagonist.She is selfless,strong,courageous,responsible and human.Very few people would step up and make the sacrifices she makes.I really admire her!<br /><br />While at one end we have a strong,rough and tough female on the other end we have a male protagonist who is her complete opposite.<br />Peeta knows his chances of survival are very low but that doesn't make him loose hope.He tries not to hurt anyone,even when they're out to get him.It was nice to see that not everyone becomes a blood thirsty animal if they are put in such a precarious situation.<br /><br />This book had strong characters,a very thought provoking and engaging storyline and it introduces us to unique world.Suzzanne Collins has you begging for a sequel before the book is over.<br /><br />When I finished this book,the only word that came to my mind was AMAZING and I think that there's nothing more that can be said about this book.<br /><br />THANK YOU SO MUCH MY WONDERFUL friend who literally forced me to read this book NOW!o my mind was AMAZING and I think that there's nothing more that can be said about this book.  THANK YOU SO MUCH MY WONDERFUL friend who literally forced me to read this book NOW!

0740748475|5.0|As I wandered the internet viewing obscure articles and pages about nothing while avoiding the slew of papers that were close to being due, I found myself on the Wikipedia page for Calvin and Hobbes. It was at the Wikipedia page that I found out about this product, a complete collection of every strip printed of Calvin and Hobbes EVER. I paused, at first in disbelief, but then found myself pondering who would enjoy reading this? Then it struck me quite quickly: my girlfriend's birthday was coming up and I had yet to get her anything, and if there was something she liked more than me, it was a six-year-old boy and a tiger. As creepy as that sounds, have no fear, I was merely referring to Calvin and his \\"real\\" tiger, Hobbes. So, I found this product on Amazon instead of heading out to a local bookstore because gas is zany right now, and placed an order for a copy of The Complete Calvin and Hobbes. It arrived within a week and sat on my floor until the recipient's birthday rolled around and she came back from Virginia Tech. I made her guess what I got her, it was quite fun, and then when she saw it she all but ignored be for a solid thirty minutes as she opened each volume up and slowly turned the pages. I would definitely say that this product is highly worth it, especially due to Amazon listing it for far less than the $150 printed on a removable slip of paper within the product itself.    Whether you are a Calvin and Hobbes fanatic or you just want to surprise some lucky person who is obsessed, I highly suggest you purchase this set of books. Just like the description states, it has every comic from the ten year run, plus a bunch of extra material from Bill Watterson himself. You will enjoy this set.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|Each song on the album was brilliantly noted to perfection. Every lyric, guitar strum, Durm beat, and just the whole album together. I have listened to every song, and I adore them all. I would highly reccomend, \\"That's what you get\\" \\"Misery Buisness\\" \\"When it rains\\" \\"Let the Flames begin\\" And \\"Born for this.\\" This is Paramore's second album, but they have taken a huge step towards becoming an excellent band. I would highly recommend this item.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|Augh!  This has to be one of the first movies in a long time that both Mr. Ireland and I ejected from the DVD player.  It goes nowhere.  At all.  The slow build up at the start and the first induced car crash held both of us.  But the lengthly second set up was too dull.  The forced '70's feel of filming interrupted by cellphones, etc burned thin quickly.  The DVD player spat it out while the 2nd set of chicks were debating test-driving stuntman style the white Dodge Challenger.

1441979212|5.0|As a trainer in English for Academic Purposes, what I really like about this book is that it focuses not just on how to write each section of a paper (Part 2 of the book), but also on how to write clear, concise, unambiguous English (Part 1). It tells the students all kind of things that I have not found in other books on this topic: e.g. how to highlight the major findings (a skill most of my students are majorly lacking), how to paraphrase, how to avoid plagiarism, how to 'hedge' claims and to criticize the works of others in a positive constructive manner, and really importantly, how to keep the referees and editors happy (the author has apparently read hundreds of referees reports and analysed why papers typically get rejected from a language point of view).    Each chapter dedicated to the various sections of a paper has very clearly instructions on a) how to structure a particular section, b) how to differentiate it from other sections (e.g. how to write the Conclusions so that they are not simply a cut and paste of the Abstract), c) what and what not to include in terms of content. There is also a check list at the end of each chapter. Also, there are about 20 pages of useful phrases that students can use while drafting their manuscript.    I really recommend this book not just to students but also to EAP teachers (check out the same author's book on Presentations - very useful). It is written in a way that can be understood by students with an upper intermediate level of English.

B004EPYZP8|5.0|WARNING: CONTAINS MIDPOINT PLOT TWIST<br />Matthew McConaughey plays Mike Haller, a smooth LA high priced lawyer who defends scumbags. He is proud of how he gets off criminals and uses unethical means to do so. However, he sobs like a baby when he finds out he put an innocent man in jail. The local DAs loathe him.<br /><br />A party girl is beat up and accuses a rich pretty boy (Ryan Phillippe), son of a real estate agent. He claims he was set up and there is evidence to indicate he was set up. However things are not quite right as the our lawyer finds out. Upon investigation he discovers that his client not only beat up the girl, but had done this once before during which the girl was killed except Mike Haller's former Hispanic defendant had taken the rap! Rather than walk away from a big money case, Haller must try to figure out a way to get an innocent Hispanic man out of prison, while presenting a case to make the real killer walk. Marisa Tomei plays the ex-wife and a prosecuter in this film and finally has gotten a role where she keeps her clothes on. William H. Macey has grown his hair out to play a private detective.<br /><br />Good courtroom drama as well as an intriguing tale as things keep moving and twisting.

0316010669|1.0|I read the entire book (nearly 300 pages) and not once does he tell you how to utilize/hone/refine/implement any of the thin-slicing skills that the book is about.  It's just a collection of short stories to prove the point that thin-slicing is as effective as exhaustive scientific research.  This would be an excellent book for an undergrad Intro to Psychology class, but for someone looking to learn how to apply those skills in the real world, it is awful.  What makes it so bad is that he implies that readers are going to come away with some sense of how to utlize their thin-slicing skills.  I am actually upset that I read this entire book.  I wish I could get my Sunday back.

B004G6009U|5.0|This was a gift for my three granddaughts and they love it so much that can just about tell the story from memory.
1423389409|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicle is the story behind a legend -- the real truth about the famous young man who has come to be known, for various reasons, as Kvothe the Arcane, Kvothe the Bloodless, the Kingkiller, etc. There are many names for, and stories about, Kvothe, but nobody knows which ones are true and which are merely based on some small kernel of truth. The Chronicler, though, is getting the scoop. He's sitting down with Kvothe, now a humble innkeeper (how did that happen?!), over three days to learn the true story and to write it down. The Name of the Wind was Day One -- when we learned about Kvothe's early childhood and his goal to be admitted to the university so he could find out about the Chandrian -- the strange beings who killed Kvothe's parents and who nobody else seems to believe in.<br /><br />The Wise Man's Fear is Day Two. For the first part of the book, Kvothe is still at the university. His problems with poverty, teachers, girls, and his enemy Ambrose continue. Though it's a lot of the same stuff we've seen before, and it is a bit tiring to constantly hear about how arrogant and clever Kvothe is, I actually enjoyed this part of the book the most. Kvothe's antics are funny, I'm a sucker for a university setting, I enjoyed the explanations of sympathy and artificing, and I just can't help but adore Kvothe for loving the library stacks so much that he has to crawl through dirty hidden subterranean tunnels to sneak in.<br /><br />Yet when Kvothe leaves the university for a possible patronage, I was ready for some new scenery because his life had become a bit stagnant (the familiar cycle of admissions, trying to earn money, trying to find Denna, avoiding Ambrose's pranks, etc). At first the change was welcome, but when Kvothe is sent off to lead a group of mercenaries to flush bandits out of the forest, the story became downright dull except for the climactic scene with the bandits. After that there's an insufferably long episode with Tempi and the Adem which crawled on for hours in my audio version. I had to increase the playback speed so I could get through it -- I was having a hard time believing in their culture (and Kvothe's reaction to it) and, besides, I was seriously worried that Chronicler's hand was going to seize up, or that he'd fallen asleep while Kvothe rambled on. (By the way, I recognize, from reading other reviews, that my opinion is the minority one.)<br /><br />The audio version, produced by Brilliance Audio, was read by Nick Podehl -- an excellent choice for The Wise Man's Fear. His voice for Kvothe is perfect and he does a great job with the other characters, too. The book is 43 hours long and it's a great way to read this story, though you may find that you need to occasionally increase playback speed which you can do with Windows Media Player or an iPod.<br /><br />I've struggled with how to rate The Wise Man's Fear. I love Kvothe, and it's a lot of fun to watch him use his intelligence and his trouper skills to build his own legendary reputation.

I had to increase the playback speed so I could get through it -- I was having a hard time believing in their culture (and Kvothe's reaction to it) and, besides, I was seriously worried that Chronicler's hand was going to seize up, or that he'd fallen asleep while Kvothe rambled on. (By the way, I recognize, from reading other reviews, that my opinion is the minority one.)    The audio version, produced by Brilliance Audio, was read by Nick Podehl -- an excellent choice for The Wise Man's Fear. His voice for Kvothe is perfect and he does a great job with the other characters, too. The book is 43 hours long and it's a great way to read this story, though you may find that you need to occasionally increase playback speed which you can do with Windows Media Player or an iPod.    I've struggled with how to rate The Wise Man's Fear. I love Kvothe, and it's a lot of fun to watch him use his intelligence and his trouper skills to build his own legendary reputation. The problem isn't the story -- the problem is that the story doesn't need to be this long. There's a better shorter book inside The Wise Man's Fear.

B004A8ZWSS|1.0|A film of astonishing banality, \\"The Tourist\\" (2010) stumbles from one lifeless sequence to the next. Angelina Jolie strikes a pose while Johnny Depp looks hopelessly befuddled in this predictable and boring attempt at Hitchcockian suspense. One of the worst big-budget movies ever made - a jaw-dropping embarrassment for all concerned.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Although it's hard to review just one book in a series, I'll do just that. Why? Because \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is the book that got me caught in Martin's (wonderful) web of intrigue and suspense. It's an excellent book for several reasons. The plot is good, the characters are all interesting, the flow is nice, and, most important of all, it's well written. I especially enjoy the way the story is told: through different perspectives from the main characters. Even though one often finds oneself wondering what other characters are doing at times - it adds depth and flavour. If there's something negative to say about this book - it's the always present descriptions of the character's garb. Sure, it helps the imagination, but at times it can become a bit tiring. Anyway, I'd suggest this book (and the series) to almost anyone. Except fantasy haters.

B002ZG981E|3.0|***This review may contain spoilers.  What it doesn't contain is a rehash of the plot.  Sorry. You'll have to look elsewhere for that.***<br /><br />Everyone and his Yorkshire Terrier is commenting on \\"Inception\\". I'll chip in my two-cent criticism as well.<br /><br />I viewed this movie with my friends Mark and Ron at the AMC Theater in Framingham on Flutie Pass (yes, named after Doug). All of us came out stunned. Ron thought it was the stupidest movie he had seen. Mark colorfully opined that it was some really (expletive deleted) weird (expletive deleted). I tried to be more thoughtfully diplomatic by describing what I thought the movie was trying to do. Basically, I thought \\"Inception\\" tried to take the ancient themes of \\"What is reality, what is dream?\\" and \\"Is it all a dream\\" into convoluted, tiered, and entertaining directions.<br /><br />I disagree with Mr. Ebert's assessment in his review that \\"Inception\\" is \\"wholly original\\". \\"Inception\\" will remind you of many other movies; for example, it obviously evoked \\"Dreamscape\\", \\"The Matrix\\", and any Bond thriller you've ever seen. But did I \\"like\\" it? Well, in past blogs I alluded to the concept of \\"cinematic dissonance\\" (which I believe should be included in Mr. Ebert's movie glossary, by the way), a simultaneous experience where your intellect regards a film as garbage while your emotions regard the film as great fun. With \\"Inception\\" I somewhat experienced the converse; my intellect appreciated the straight/convoluted logic of the plot while my emotions simultaneously and eventually surrendered to impatience and boredom, in spite of the phantasmagoric special effects and intense action. Well, it was late, and I am more of a morning person.<br /><br />Like other movies in the \\"dreams/reality\\" genre, \\"Inception\\" sucks you into deciding which exciting, involved scenario is a dream or not, even when we are apparently \\"told\\" which one. This \\"trees at the expense of the forest\\" view is, I think, meant to be beside the point. Like all good movies in this genre, \\"Inception\\" is saying that the basic ideas to retain are \\"It's really all a dream\\" and \\"Reality is a subjectively chosen point on a circular continuum\\". Three scenes illustrate this: 1) Ariadne shows Cobb the old \\"infinite mirror\\" phenomenon in the Paris construct, 2) Cobb points out Ariadne's circular maze is the proper architectural dream construct, and 3) the entire film's circular, \\"this is where I came in\\" structure.<br /><br />\\"Inception\\" cleverly distracts us from this unsettling overall view with its noisy plot spinnings, the deceptive \\"3-dimensional chess\\" structure (recall Ariadnee's choice of a bronze pawn as her \\"reality marker\\") of the putative idea-planting plot, and the more emotionally involving dilemmas of Fischer's and Cobb's family issues. Nolan also realizes that these distractions also make the potentially alienating and disquieting notion that nothing is truly real more entertainingly palatable. In other words, we arbitrarily choose Cobb's and Fischer's situations as the reality to which we want to cling because they are at least understandable, reasonably entertaining, and diverting from the bleak \\"non-reality\\". Michael Caine's character underscores that with his exhortation to Cobb, \\"Come back to reality\\", making him, and not Cobb's top, the actual arbitrary \\"reality marker\\".<br /><br />Inception asks, \\"At what point does the circle (of life) begin?\\" Even though the movie gives you an \\"answer\\", the real answer is \\"Any point you choose.\\" Some would say \\"Inception\\" demands repeated concentration. If you want to go on a metaphor and symbol scavenger hunt (and there's nothing wrong with that), go right ahead. I don't think it's strictly necessary. One viewing is enough to tell you that life is but a dream.<br /><br />P.S.: I think Nolan wants you to be lulled into happy closure with Cobb's \\"apparent reunion\\" with his children. The muted, static way that reunion scene is shot suggests otherwise. The Dream Never Dies.  Hey, what a great title for the inevitable sequel.  Also a great title for another Bond flick.le sequel.  Also a great title for another Bond flick.

B004SEVPWQ|5.0|This is completely worth grabbing today, you're definitely not wasting your time. I bought this a year ago, it's name was different at the time, but the only reason i bought it was because the free versions graphics were so fantastic. Honestly, this is the game you put on to impress your friends. It's smooth, it's 3d, it looks wonderful. And even better, it plays extremely nicely. This is hands-down the best pool game for android. The 2d pool break pro is ok, but this is in a different league. You can even play against people on this, as well as there being a lot of different types of games. I paid $3 a year ago, and don't regret my purchase at all. Download it, love it, be impressed, enjoy!<br /><br />Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)

1401323820|4.0|This book was a fun, easy read. It was like being in on an inside joke; this was the book everyone was talking about and now we get to read it, too. It's not great literature but then it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be a guilty pleasure and it is. It was a bit confusing to read because the characters are (almost) the same as on the show but the names are different and you keep wanting to call them by their TV names.
B001KW0C96|2.0|I thought this would be a blockbuster but was kinda disappointed with this one.  The story was weak and the ending left me with something to be desired.  It played on the old story line of an over-the-hill cop who does things his own way.....how many time have we seen this in a movie!  Really, I think this was just a payday for Deniro and Pacino.  The movie didn't challegne these guys at all.  They could have done these roles in their sleep.

B003Q6D1YW|4.0|Some people like the taste of catfish, others prefer salmon. I just saw a very interesting film called 'Catfish', and it seems to have much the same effect. Why is the authenticity of documentaries always questioned? Are we really that cynical? Yes, we are. If Morgan Spurlock ('Supersize Me') called it \\"the best fake documentary I've ever seen\\", well... isn't that something? In 'Catfish', the players believe what they want to believe, without a good reason not to. We take for granted that the relationships are almost completely dependent on facebook profiles and message boards. I'd hate to spoil what happens next, because it really is worth seeing. Those expecting an mind-blowing twist might be disappointed, but as Nev slowly uncovers the truth, we can't help but be taken along. The film and the people in it are entertaining and kind-hearted; quite why you'd care if it's real or not is a mystery to me.

B003498SDA|5.0|Great Michael Mann actioner with an amazing Jamie Foxx performance and Tom Cruise playing a human-terminator heavy.<br /><br />Cruise's role is a hit man trying to take out multiple targets in a single evening, who hijacks a cab driven by Jamie Foxx.<br /><br />Apparently the critics weren't ready to see Cruise playing a psychopathic professional killer, because the film got mixed reviews and a lukewarm reception from the audience.<br /><br />I love the film and admire Cruise for having the guts to take a role so far against type for him.  He absolutely nails it!<br /><br />Foxx matches him stride-for-stride as the cab driver with the big dreams who finds himself still driving a cab 12 years later.  The arc of his character, and the subtlety Foxx brings to the progression, are amazing.  His character's turning point in the movie is one of the most compelling moments I've seen on celluloid.<br /><br />The action elements fly off the screen too.<br /><br />The film was shot mostly at night in hi-def video, and bluray transfer is generally regarded as one of the best ever.  Ditto the soundtrack.  This is probably why the bluray price is holding above $15 for so lon.<br /><br />R-rated for startling and graphic -- not gruesome -- violence, and language, and deservedly so.<br /><br />Defiitely a mandatory purchase for serious bluray collectors.  Five stars!

B0015XHQTY|4.0|Clint Eastwood set the mold for gritty 1970's police thrillers, as Inspector Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (1971).  Things kind of spun off course in the sequel Magnum Force (1973), where the focus was on Callahan and a band of rogue police officers, rather than pursing a major villain.  Rather than continuing to show regard and respect for the men in blue, Magnum Force featured vigilantes betraying the public trust.  After these mixed messages, The Enforcer (1976) is a return to more solid ground.  Callahan remains a larger than life character, continually at odds with the brass, but his motivation is more personal, after the death of his long time friend Frank DiGeorgio (John Mitchum).<br /><br />Following in the wake of the recent Patty Hearst's kidnapping by the SLA, the plot features the People's Revolutionary Strike Force (PRSF), a terrorist group who have major plans.  DiGeorgio is knifed, while trying to stop the PRSF from stealing weapons.  Callahan is enraged at the death of his partner, but can't work on the case.  For disciplinary reasons, Callahan has been transferred to the personnel department, interviewing candidates for detective.  Foreshadowing her role in Cagney and Lacy, Tyne Daly stars as Kate Moore, an officer with no street experience who is promoted to inspector, and made Harry's partner.<br /><br />Much about The Enforcer is cartoonish clich&eacute; that had been seen in the previous films, but the relationship between Callahan and Moore is something new, and has some sense of realism.  Moore initially struggles with coming to terms with her new job.  Without much guidance from Harry, she slowly evolves from making her first kill, into someone prepared to take charge.  Daly's strong performance connects with the audience, and what happens to Kate Moore probably makes the deepest impression among any of Dirty Harry's partners.<br /><br />The terrorist group is largely made up of fanatical ultra-violent types, who kill when they don't really have to.  Their kidnapping of the mayor is a bold move, but is a repeat of the ransom theme that was kind of played out in Dirty Harry.  Considering that the terrorists could have blown up city hall or worse, their actions are far less destructive than they could have been.  While it may serve a cinematic purpose, it makes little logical sense for the terrorists to hole up in Alcatraz prison, where they can't make a fast getaway.  There are some decent action scenes on the island, but they are far from spectacular, and seem a little rushed.  Perhaps it's more scaling things down, to a level that Harry can still manage mostly by himself.<br /><br />Eastwood had planned on directing the film, but was too involved in the post-production of The Outlaw Josey Wales, so the job went to James Fargo, who made his directorial debut.  Jerry Fielding, who also worked on Josey Wales, provides the music, giving the movie a more jazzy feel.  The Enforcer is gratuitously violent, and the plot drifts off course particularly at the end, but overall the film recaptures some of the gritty feel of being on the streets, and steers the series back in a direction slightly closer to the original.

0307887960|1.0|EDIT: Not surprised that this got a low rating. People generally don't want to hear the truth. Everything in this review is complete fact. If you hate facts when they go against what you want to believe, don't read this.    High protein/low carb diets are proven to help you lose weight quickly, because of two factors: less calories in than out, and boring meals that you don't look forward to, and thus eat less of. They are not proven to keep the weight off, and they are proven to be harmful in the long-run (protein is not a clean-burning fuel due to its nitrogen content, and research has shown that people who eat high protein diets have a higher incidence of various chronic diseases and don't live as long).    In short, it's an unhealthy way to lose weight. But high protein diets are VERY popular because people have a complete misunderstanding of nutrition due to a lot of misinformation that has been out there for decades. Somehow people think that protein is the superior macronutrient, and that the more the better. Complete nonsense -- ask any nutritional researcher. Almost all of them, certainly all of the most respected ones, will tell you that people are eating too much meat as it is.    So why even follow a plan? If you've got a big day ahead of you, a wedding or something, and you are willing to be unhealthy for a short period of time in order to lose weight, just barely eat anything and you'll lose even more weight. That's what most models and celebrities do. The time spent ordering this book, waiting for it to ship, reading it and planning out your diet could be spent on the treadmill/not eating.    You really think Kate Middleton followed this diet? Trust me -- she was on the celebrity diet. Barely any food + lots of exercise. Maybe what she ate was mainly meat, but she barely ate any of it.    But exercise/starving yourself? That's hard work! People would rather find a book that claims to be the holy grail and hope to get their answers from it. A book thatwill offer them everything. Weight loss plus delicious food plus minimal effort! That's why these diet books still sell like crazy after all these years. That's why the ones that say eat more meat and less vegetables sell the best. That's why all of the authors, with all of their conflicting nonsense, continue to get filthy rich from this. Take some existing nonsense that feeds into people's misunderstanding, put a new name on it, put out a new book and you get rich. It's such an effective money-making scheme.     No wonder people are so confused about health. I'd get into this racket myself but unfortunately I have this terrible handicap -- I'm a moral person.    Don't be a sucker. If you want to be optimally healthy, eat delicious food and lose weight at the same time, but are willing to take a little more time with it, I recommend reading any of Dr. Andrew Weil's books. Or just go to his website. It's free.

B004EPYZU8|5.0|Long review short, I fell in love as soon as the first dirigble graced the screen. More on that later.    It's weird to see that the editorial review did focus a lot on the women's looks rather than the plot (of which there were layers of). I do apologize in advance if this seems to be one of those \\"Nuh-uh, you're wrong and here's why\\" reviews. Two people can see the same movie two different ways, for example, Ron Howard can see the Dilemma as a comedy while all I saw was a sad tale of people's lives falling apart.    As I said before, the movie is layered. The first layer, Reality, falls away pretty quickly and without warning. The other two layers, The Imagined Brothel and Fantasy, switch back and forth throughout most of the movie. As only a small part of the movie takes place in harsh, naked reality, it must be forgiven if the physics are a little off.     The Imagined Brothel is either the result of a mind trying to escape the true horrors of it's situation (the mental hospital was simply too terrible to process, a distinct possibility), the side effect of a drug (a \\"treatment\\" or a way to make it seem as though she was actually crazy), a combination of the first two, or perhaps she was actually mentally ill (schizophrenia is a condition in which the bounds between reality and fantasy are broken down, which is where the brothel layer is.) Interestingly, schizophrenia can be mistaken for a bad trip. Perhaps the more well-meaning staff had tried to medicate her, and the side effect was this very hallucination? It would explain why the brothel events have echoes in reality. We have no way of knowing if those other girls were aware that they were being depicted in Babydoll's mind as anything but the way they really looked and where they really were.    The Fantasy layer is what you saw on the previews. Epic, awesome, full of everything from clockwork zombies to robots to orcs. In this layer, the girls had real power. I think this layer is also where the movie becomes a chick flick. Instead of watching the girls forced into dancing in the brothel, they move into a realm where they can do something. The task is related to the task in both other layers, but more done up. This realm is the most mentally based, so things do get a little weird. There's also beautiful music and the bonds of sisterhood deepening as the girls slaughter their inner demons.    So, to me, the story wasn't about hotties slicing things up as many many professional critics seem to think (and the last few seconds seem to back me up there). What I think we're witnessing here, between the poor professional reviews, the seemingly short run (in my local theater anyway), and the large number of people who stayed through the whole movie and loved it, is the birth of a cult hit.

0385732554|4.0|Before the [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]], [[ASIN:0385732554 The Giver]] defined juvenile dystopian literature. It is the story of a highly controlled society, where residents are assigned jobs at age twelve. Sexuality, morality, ethics, language, and memories are regulated. The sole exception to this Orwellian nightmare is the Receiver of Memories, a highly prestigious post equivalent to an historian and political advisor.<br /><br />When Jonas is selected to be trained as the next Receiver, he is shocked. Training involves the Giver (Jonas' nickname for the Receiver), transmitting ancient memories from generations past. Color, climate, war, and love have faded from humanity. Jonas is freed by the loosened restrictions of his speech, but weighted by the burden of knowledge. He begins to question the idea of release--where infants and the elderly are euthanized. Jonas also wants to spread some of the memories around, rather than bear the burden of memories for all humanity.<br /><br />The ending is anticlimactic by contemporary standards. There is no big war, no active defiance of the state. Rather, a revelation leads the main character to make a choice. Is it better to face a reality with pain or a fiction with blunted tranquility? The motif is simple enough for mature elementary and middle school students, but with writing strong enough to suit adults readers. [[ASIN:0385732554 The Giver]] is worthy of its place as a children's classic.

0470449748|3.0|If you're looking for a GMAT prep book that simply gives you a bunch of practice problems and nothing else, then this is the book for you. If you're like most people and need some in-depth math review, then this isn't for you.    This book lacks an in-depth review of the math concepts to be tested on the GMAT. The review in the beginning does a great job of reviewing basic principals, but it doesn't go into detail on the problems that often combine two or three different principals. Not even the answer explainations go into enough detail. The explainations do not show how one result went to the next, ultimately resulting in the answer. They also don't provide a reason to use certain principals, or explain how they knew what to do to solve the problem. The practice problems are displayed at random, so the question type varies within each section (Data suffiency and word problems are not intermixed however.) If you need some repition on a topic, you won't find it here.    If your math skills are pretty good, and you're also good at reading between the lines (often needed on this test), then this book is good for you since it just goes over common questions.     Since it is written by the makers of the test, they don't give much insight into tricks they play, or strategies to solve certain types of problems. For this, I recommend the Veritas test prep guides. Their books include drills on even basic topics like factoring and decimals. Sounds elementary, but the GMAT is based on basic topics that build on each other. Therefore, a concrete understanding of these principals, and knowing ways to solve them quickly without a calculator, is very important.     Good luck and happy studying!
B004V6X90W|5.0|I hate romantic comedies. I feel like they manipulate your feelings, and are overly formulaic. That said, I really enjoyed this movie. The characters motivations and actions were believable. I was pleasantly surprised by the chemistry between Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. Granted, this was based on a true story, but there was some fine acting bringing the characters to life. Definitely worth watching!
B0019NB9A2|4.0|This blu-ray version of what is obviously the inspiration for Star Trek is a real treat for fans as the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved.  I remember watching this on the Turner Classic Movies channel and it was barely watchable but now it's like watching a new film!  While the picture quality isn't perfect as there are a few problematic frames here and there but compared to what I saw on the TCM channel the difference is like night and day.  As for the sound quality the DTS HD MA 5.1 sound is fantastic.  The special features are very good as well with great documentaries and even the not-so-good \\"sequel\\" featuring Robby the Robot \\"The Invisible Boy\\" which comes across more like a kiddy comedy than its much more serious and better prior film.  \\"Forbidden Planet\\" marks a number of firsts such as being MGM's first serious Sci-Fi film, the birth of techno music for the score, the depiction of man travelling faster than light and exploring other planets and for fans of Star Trek like myself you get the feeling that you are watching the true pilot of Star Trek: TOS.  Star Trek: TOS is like the serialised tv version of the \\"Forbidden Planet\\" feature film like the way it was for \\"M*A*S*H\\".  The relationship between the doctor and the captain prefigures Bones and Kirk, the short mini skirts that Anne Francis wears and the sexual innuendoes also show up on Star Trek: TOS while the reference to adamantium metal reminded me of Wolverine and the deep shafts underground reminded me a lot of the Death Star in \\"Star Wars\\" and of a couple of episodes in the early seasons of \\"Babylon 5\\" concerning the strange being on the planet below the space station.  Even Disney Studios had a hand in the special effects here as MGM takes a genre that was at the time \\"B\\" movie fodder into the \\"A\\" grade.<br /><br />Fans of Sci-Fi simply have to have this in their video library as an example of a pioneer and major influencer of many sci-fi films that followed.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|Fantastic app. Pretty nice graphic. Excellent control though not perfect, but still being able to represent the game fairly accurately. Also being able to challenge other online players are great
B004UID2LC|5.0|sweeeeeet! Get to watch videos without internet connection now! :) works just like it says! super easy to figure out and use
B004SEVPWQ|1.0|Too much!  Can't figure out how to control ball speed.  Can't see the whole table on my droid x.  Moving the cue stick is a headache.  But it does tell you with a line exactly where the ball will go, so if you don't really know how to play the game you will like it...
B002DKGWSE|2.0|The first one is so better. Every aspect is better. The actors, Characters, Plotline. Everything. Let's talk about the convicts first. The origanal gives info about what their crimes were and stuff like that. I actually like the criminals in the first one. I love Jr because he really is just manipulatied by his dad. They make them funny and actually like talk to each other. The part in the hotel where there all hanging out really makes the movie good. They show them bring the girls out the fire escape and put them in the trunk and they don't have them escape so much. Jr compared to Justin, Krugs son in the origanal was a problem for me. He didnt fit the role. Jr in the origanal was a shy drug addicted loser and Justin didn't fit that. Now plot, the plot was the worst thing everything in the origanal was realistic and made sense. In the new one Justin brings them over to his house to do drugs but why?? would he do that if he was living with convicts. He just can't smoke pot by himself? Then they kidnap them because they think they'll tell, but what exactly? They didnt know they were convicts. Then they get in an accident. That wasnt even needed? Then the Paige, the new phyliss, excapes? She barely get's any time then after they catch her they start stripping mari and then they kill Paige because she talked back. The killing sequence for paige isnt even as gory as the original. And you dont care when she dies. I'll admit the rape scene in this one is way worse but it's so bad because it over compensates for the lake of anything else happening. The thing I had a problem with it how Mari survives and they still kill all of them. Why? Just because she got raped by the 1 one guy. Skip this one the original is gorier, has better actors, plot, kills sequences, and more nudity. See the original don't waste your time on the new on like I did.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|I downloaded the free version a few weeks ago and liked it enough to want to buy it.  Just didn't get around to it.  Now amazon has it for free today.   Yah!  Thanks amazon.
B004132HZS|5.0|Excellent!  They have updated the time but kept Holmes as Arthur Conan Doyle wrote him.  I have read all the books and have enjoyed many tv and movies but this is one of the best.  I enjoyed Jeremy Brett's Holmes and   Basil Rathbone.  I am glad they updated the time but kept Holmes character traits.  I enjoy the actors who pay Holmes and Watson.  Looking forward to next season.
B004SEVPWQ|1.0|Quite the lazy developer, plagarized an EULA from some other software product for a real computer. Completely restrictive and not needed on an android. Had I of bought this I would have fought for a refund, because I will not agree to such rediculousness.
159420229X|1.0|I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK.  I WAS EXPECTING AN INDEPTH LOOK AT MEMORY TRAINING.  RATHER IT WAS MORE OF A REVIEW OF MEMORY THEORIES THROUGHOUT HISTORY WITHOUT MUCH INDEPTH LOOK AT METHODS.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THEORIES AND HOW TO'S THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU.
B004XS97KO|5.0|Loved first episode, don't have BBC in America.  How soon 'til 2nd episode is up?  Happy to pay to see!
1591843790|1.0|Lately both Guy Kawasaki and Seth Godin has been writing books for the sake of writing. I have due respect for both of them but there is nothing new in this book, rather its boring and waste of valuable time. There are no hard and fast rules to build great companies, Google followed its own philosophy to build a great search engine and likewise Apple followed its own philosophy to build great products.  Its a good thing to reason what steve jobs will do /what Bill gates will do but there is no guarantee that they both will succeed at it .<br /><br />Same old stories and same old garbage.  Save your money
B004YNWBNS|5.0|Fringe is always pretty good...but than sometimes it's great. This is one of those episodes. I suggest to watch the previous episode too because Alternate Olivia is almost better acted than original. It's kinda cool that they started making her good. Anyway this episode has it all; lot's of action, love, science-fiction, God. It's not perfect but no great show is.
0002171856|5.0|One of my favorite books. Full of useful information. You never know when you might need some of these useful tips. Recommended.
B004SEVPWQ|1.0|In order to play this game, you have to agree to a ripped-off EULA that does not fit with the current state of the Amazon App Store. This may have been a case of the developer failing to understand the EULA .  For example, they use the single user license, but Amazon lets you download the game to multiple phones that are tied to your Amazon account. You *cant* buy the app again.
1607050072|1.0|I almost returned this book - there is not much to it unless you are Scandinavian and  perhaps involved in some of these images since childhood.
B000002LE6|4.0|Despite the album cover being the most vocal point with prince's bravery for posing completely naked and can never forget the reaction of some of my family members when one of my aunts bought home this title on cassette tape when I was little in the late 80's, the concept of having all the songs played in a sequence is quite different than any other artist or group/band that I heard of or known. It's like listening to a broadway stage play. There is one particular piece \\"anna stesia\\", the beginning is absolutely awe inspiring and mesmerizing classical sounding solo I believe done on a keyboard/synthesizer in the first part of the song that makes me want to play the beginning of it over and over, and that particular beginning piece of \\"anna stesia\\" sound like something from a capcom super nintendo video game from the 1990's.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game was super fun only issue is it was too short. Fantastic graphics. Fun puzzles. It just ended so quickly it was kind of a let down.

B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is one of the best Disney movies and as a kid I loved it. However, the movie I got had a couple of addition, like a new song but it was still great. My son (2.5 years old) really enjoys watching the movie as well. If you don't have it, I highly recommend getting it.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|While I am not a huge fan of the Zombie genre, I do own a considerable amount of Dvd's about the brain eaters. This to me has to be the best of them all. There is more to The Walking Dead than your usual zombie movie. It's not just about the survival of the living, but there is a plot with sub-plots as well. The stories are character driven instead of the usual bloody fanfare. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of blood and gore for those seeking that as well. I won't give any spoilers, so all I am going to say is that if you like a good story no let me correct that, if you like a great story then this is for you. The quality alone is more than you would expect from a TV show. More, the actors are unknown but top-notch and sure to be seen in future endeavors just for their acting in this series. My only complaint, is that there are only 6 episodes. I truly found myself wanting more at the end of the six episodes. Season two should give us all that.     Ralph.
B004XCUEXY|4.0|I saw this in the theater and loved how honest everyone was. At first I thought it might be a put-on because the drummer that lasted, I think, one album before being replaced talked about getting \\"the phone call\\". Its a testament to Grohl that he was able to get everyone into a studio to talk honestly about their experiences. A lot of great information in this!     After the documentary, the Foo Fighters played the entire album, Wasting Light, in a studio somewhere and it was great. It should be included with this to recreate the entire experience. Hopefully it will someday...
B003PIUBZS|1.0|This show is nothing but a cover for throwing every naked woman they could get to sign their contract on tv. Even during serious conversations there are a dozen naked women dancing in the background and having sex every chance they get. When no one is having sex or stripping, there are gladiators Of course doing what gladiators do. Violence is expected, but honestly all the naked women make this little more than a man's masturbatory fodder rather than enjoyable historical fiction I was hoping for.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|A great soundtrack, I liked all but one song and that's only because I do not care for that one song's genre. It's the perfect accompaniment to the 2 hour music video that was Sucker Punch

B001UV4XI8|3.0|I started watch it on DVD with an upscale player and first thing I did notice was the poor quality in video. Usually with new releases and the upscale DVD player, it turns out really well, not as good as Blu-Ray but still a pretty good picture. Not the case with this one. WOW. Lots of jagged lines around the images like I was watching a bad copied version. I never thought they would have done this to todays Harry Potter.     As for the movie, It was slow alot of the times. I started to get bored really. The action scenes were good but it felt to me like they were trying to kill time around the middle part of the movie. That with the poor quality, I didn't enjoy this release as much as the past chapters. I hope they fix part 2.
B003Z2LAAO|4.0|I love DMB(Dave Matthews Band) so it was pretty easy for me to choose this Blu Ray and I have always loved the Grand Canyon and got a new 3D TV it was a good choose for me great 3D effect's and the price was good...I enjoyed it...I think you will too...
1423113381|3.0|Rick Riordan tries his hand at Egyptian mythology in this book starring siblings Carter and his younger sister, Sadie. Having grown up each raised by one parent on different continents, they are not fond of each other but they put their differences aside to save their father, a famed Egyptologist. An evil Egyptian god threatens to destroy the world. The audio version is superb, with two voice actors playing the teens but the story itself didn't keep my attention throughout the entire story. The ending lends itself well to the sequel, The Throne of Fire, which will be released 5/3/11.
0316056863|5.0|I bought this book as soon as it came out. I will tell you it is a must-read. If you like Tina's comedy on 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live, then you will love this book. You get so much insight into her life, why she is so funny, and how she got that scar on her face.     If you love Tina Fey or Liz Lemon, then you must read this book!
0061537969|5.0|If you like dogs, enjoy family stories, understand a bit about auto racing, and want a bit of romance and suspense, this is the book for you.  It's a fictional piece about a young man and his dog, his human family and his trials and tribulations that could well be true... and it's told from his dog's point of view, which is poignant and full of understanding of human foibles, weaknesses and strengths.  It's hard to put down.
B004J1DBJI|1.0|I could almost see this app being useful but somehow the developer found a way to have it force close on every search. had I actually paid for this app I would be trying to find a way to be refunded. I'm using a stock HTC Thunderbolt, I assume the app must work better with some phones but on mine it is just a waste of space, buyer beware I would suggest using the Android market so you can refund it is you experience the force close fiasco that I have. 1 star because I can't give it less.

B000068TPN|5.0|Much has been written about this movie here on Amazon and much, much more has been written in other forums on other sites and other publications.  I doubt serious if I will be able to add and significant information to what has already been said.  I can and will only voice my opinion; my personal \\"take,\\" as to the merits of this film.<br /><br />First though I must state that I completely ignore the fact that some folks are Mel Gibson fans and think his is a great guy, while other despise him due to his off screen behavior and some of the remarks he has made over the past few years.  I also hate to see this film and these reviews, along with remarks on many of the reviews, being used as a platform to voice opinions over the merits of the Viet Nam war and those who fought in it.<br /><br />Anyway...I like this film.  I thought it was quite well done.  There have been literally hundreds upon hundreds of war films made throughout the years and only a very few of them actually \\"got it.\\"  Of those few that did get it, even they cannot possibly offer people who have never experienced the actual horror of war even a close or vague feeling of what it is really like.  I will say though that this film is pretty close...as far as it goes.<br /><br />One of the first things that impressed me was the extremely narrow \\"field of vision,\\" during the battle scenes.  In battle soldiers are, for the most part, only aware of a very, very small area (their little world) of the actually overall conflict.  This many times consists of only a few yards.  I thought this film depicted that very well...mass confusion, extreme fear...totally alone.<br /><br />I was also grateful for the makers of the film in that the depicted absolutely perfectly the way the wives and children of the deployed solders were treated upon notification of their husband's deaths as the battle raged.  The Army and our government were completely unprepared for what happened and this aspect of this battle, and indeed, this war was not one of our more shinning moments.  All in all it was disgraceful. I hope and pray that lessons were learned here...although I have my doubts as to this.<br /><br />There was a bang up job done with the camera work in this film and the script was excellent.  I found nothing to complain about in either of these two areas.<br /><br />The debate as to the rightness or wrongness of this was has been argued since the first shot was fired and I suspect will still be argued far, far into the future.  Right or wrong has absolutely nothing to do with these brave young men who fought in this particular cornerstone battle.  I would strongly though recommend the reading of the book on which this movie was based, [[ASIN:034547581X We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang - the Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam]]  As always, the book was much, much better than the movie.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksshinning moments.

The development, of the characters and the story, is phenominal and the writing flows quite naturally making it extremely easy to become completely engrossed in the story . . . and the STORY! Wow! Very unique and interesting. I cannot WAIT to find out what comes next!!<br /><br />I only hope it doesn't take long to get the last book! I feel bad for the author's personal reasons for the delay of the second book. I truly hope nothing like that happens to the poor guy anymore (and I'm not saying that ONLY because I want the third book -- although I can't honestly say it's not a factor ;)).<br /><br />This book is excellent. Easily one of my new favorite books.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|This is the start of a new era for the Doctor and his friends.  Matt Smith takes over as the Doctor, and gathers a few new companions to come with him on his journey through time and space.  Also, Stephen Moffat takes over as the head writer and executive producer of the show.  Does the new series compare to the Russell T. Davies and David Tennant era?  Yes it does.  The story of the Doctor and Amy Pond is a science-fiction fairy tale, spanning ages and entire worlds.  The whole series just feels fresher and more exciting now.  Here are a few reasons to watch:<br /><br />New Companions -- Amy Pond is a great addition to the show.  \\"The Girl Who Waited\\" seems to have the same tough spirit that Donna Noble had.  She's treats the Doctor like an equal, while at the same time loving him in her own way and realizing that he is something beyond her understanding.  I think she's cool.  Then we get Rory, Amy's fiance, a lovable goof and all around good guy.  He is my personal favorite of the Doctor's new companions.  He's just so out of place on their adventures.  Finally, the mysterious River Song returns to the series.  We learn a little more about her (emphasis on \\"little\\") this time around.  I enjoy watching her strange, out-of-time relationship with the Doctor play out.  There seems to be something foreboding on the horizon...<br /><br />Old Enemies -- The Daleks return in full force.  Plus we get the return of the Weeping Angels, the terrific villains of the old episode \\"Blink.\\"<br /><br />New Times and Places -- We get to see the Doctor and Amy travel to a space-faring colony of humans, whose lives depend on a terrible secret.  An old enemy appears during World War II in an unlikely place.  The Weeping Angels stalk our heroes through a synthetic forest on board a crashed spacecraft.  Deep within the Hollow Earth, an ancient threat is waking from a long slumber.  Plus, vampires in Venice, an excursion into our heroes' dreams, and an encounter with Vincent van Gogh.<br /><br />A New Doctor -- Matt Smith is wonderful as a brighter, zanier Doctor.  Smith follows on the heels of David Tennant's very popular portrayal of the Doctor.  And, in my opinion, rises to the occasion.  He's quirkier and crazier than Tennant's Doctor, but still holds enough of the character that we feel it's the same traveler of time and space that we know and love.  I love Smith's Doctor, and hope he stays around for a few seasons.<br /><br />A New Adventure -- Previous seasons have had something subtle, like a phrase, dropped into various episodes that hinted at a main storyline for each season.  (Ex: \\"Bad Wolf,\\" \\"Mister Saxon,\\" planets going missing...)  The new series does something a little more overt, but it doesn't get in the way of the self-contained episodes throughout the season.  There is a crack in the universe, slowly spreading, following the Doctor and Amy Pond through time and space.  What has damaged the whole universe, and what is the connection to Amy Pond?  It is a good story, intended as a kind of fairy tale.  And the way it all comes together in the finale is epic.<br /><br />If you haven't watched Doctor Who, then this is a great time to get on board the series.  And if you are a fan, this is a great collection of science fiction storytelling, a brand new chapter in the saga of the Doctor and his friends.th is wonderful as a brighter, zanier Doctor.

1573301183|5.0|I love Alice in Chains.  I literally grew up on them.  This show just captures the essence of what Alice IS, to be honest.  Layne's little blooper on 'Sludge Factory' was a nice reminder that celebs are people, too, they're not perfect.  And I'm not one to cry at songs...but 'Nutshell' had me sobbing almost immediately.  If you don't have this DVD, you're really missing out.  It's probably my favorite DVD of all time.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I can honestly say, I have not been interested in a new band since the Fuel/Puddle of Mudd time. But Halestorm has been my new found love interest. I was able to completely envelope myself inside this album and turned it inside out. The music is amazing, deep tones, hard driving raw sexual power, but with the voice and face of Lzzy Hale, how could you not. All in all, best new band I've seen and heard in YEARS.
B004NSVEAA|5.0|A friend of mine lent this book to me. While it's not normally the kind of book I would read, I can't describe how much I enjoyed it, and I can't really describe why that is. The story is not amazing. There is not a lot of action. The characters don't blow your mind. What it is, though, is simply great writing. This will sound cliche, but this was the first book I've ever read where I felt like there was not one wasted word.
B000F4LPJ6|3.0|Battle Royale is a stylish, bloody action flick.  I enjoyed the movie and thought it was cool, but it basically cuts the heart out of the story told in the novel.  I hate to give a trite \\"the book was better\\" review of the film, which is a good action movie in its own right, but the characters in the book are fleshed out so much better.  When you watch Battle Royale, you are only caring about a few of the characters.  The rest only serve to steal the spotlight for a moment while they die in various violent death scenes.  It's like watching action movies where dozens of people get killed and you aren't attached to any of them.  Or slasher films, where you go in knowing most of the foolish teenage cast is going to be taken out one at a time for your viewing pleasure.  The characters serve the violence, whereas in the book, the violence serves to glorify the wonderful cast of characters.  Every character that only gets a few moments in the film, gets whole pages devoted to them in the novel.<br /><br />Unlike the book, the character of the teacher Kitano is a likeable character with some depth.  I'm not sure if this enhances the story any, because the character he was based on from the novel, Kinpatsu Sakamochi, worked great as a despicable bad guy for the reader to hate.  By making Kitano a sympathetic character, the film's final act works very differently than the book.  Still, I enjoyed the final scenes of the film.  I don't mind when movies branch away from their source material.  It gives the viewer a new, different experience.  Sadly, the trade-off here is that, while Kitano's character is enhanced by the screen version of the character, the rest of the cast completely lose what made them special in the original story.<br /><br />If you are interested in cool action movies with stylized violence, or if you just want to see dozens of teenagers kill each other on screen, this is a fun movie, and a cult classic.  However, if you want a better experience, I would recommend that you read the original novel.  Every single character is a wonderful creation whose death is meaningful (sometimes tragic, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes even darkly funny, but always felt by the reader).  The movie loses what truly made the story special.  The sense of suspense and distrust is almost completely gone here.  Beautiful, tragic stories are not told.  They cut out one of my favorite characters completely.  The protagonists are much better characters in the novel.  And the antagonists, especially the wicked Mitsuko and Kiriyama, actually have their warped personalities explained.<br /><br />It might be unfair to judge the film in comparison to the novel, because it is a good action movie in its own right.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|With the crap music that has been rolling out over the last few years it is so satisfying to have a band like Foo Fighter that continue to produce good rock music, and here on Wasting Light they have finally walked into the saloon with both guns blazing.<br /><br />I have been waiting for The Foo Fighters to record an album truly worthy of following The Colour and the Shape, and now we have it here with Wasting Light. I have enjoyed all the other albums since The Colour and the Shape and have appreciated the progression of their style, but each album left me wanting something more from Dave and the gang. Maybe it was the line-up changes, maybe it was Dave's side projects...but I felt like even though they were producing solid rock songs that they used as singles the rest of the songs on the albums seemed to falter a bit.<br /><br />Here with Wasting Light the Foo Fighters have produced a cohesive album that is excellent the entire way through. Each song has some individual touch of magic that makes it unique and viable in its own way, but at the same time they all have an energy that binds them together into an album that is interconnected and solid to its core.<br /><br />Maybe it was the fact that Pat Smear came back to the fold? I know that I can hear his influence on a lot of the songs since his distinctness can be found on many of the tracks just like you could hear them back on The Colour and the Shape. It's certain that adding him back to the roster has helped the band once again reach a type of musical concrescence and the fact that he has been touring with them for the past couple of years has allowed the band to become closer. Maybe the band helped magnify that feeling of closeness due to the fact that they recorded in Dave's home studio on analogue, giving all the songs a warmer sound that just can't be produced digitally.<br /><br />Whatever happened, I'm glad it did because in the short time it's been out Wasting Light has renewed my faith that the Foo Fighters have the ability to produce an album that is both relevant and musically exceptional for its entire length. Thank you Foo Fighter for making and album that I can leave in my stereo and play on repeat a few thousand times without losing its glamour.o produce an album that is both relevant and musically exceptional for its entire length.

030745455X|5.0|After reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I immediately began reading this second one. I couldn't wait. The first one had me hooked and this one kept me hanging on. There were quite a few nights where I stayed up later than I should have simply because I couldn't wait until the next day to find out what happened. As much as I loved the first one, I loved this one just as well. Lisbeth never fails to keep things lively and you just never know what she will do next. Not only did it keep me on the edge of my seat, there were times when I had to get up and move around, it was so intense.<br /><br />This is not something you want to read if you feel like something light and fun. This is roller coaster ride that you won't forget. This reaches up and grabs you by the throat and leaves you breathless. If you like mystery and suspense and intense excitement, this is a book for you!!
0553386794|2.0|I loved fantasy lit when I was young but hadn't read one in 20 years. I saw a kid reading Sword of Shanara and it inspired me to go to the book store and pick up a fantasy book. Game of Thrones had good reviews and seemed popular so I bought it. What a disappointment. The book starts out with a cool premise, but that premise gets ignored for pretty much the rest of the book. Then we're introduced to three other story lines, which are somewhat interesting, but that's about the best I can say. Instead of any kind of action or suspense we get endless pages of descriptions. Descriptions of the food they're eating, description of the castles, description of every single person's family history, and most of all, descriptions of their clothes. Endless descriptions of their clothes. The author must be a frustrated fashion designer. The plots are interesting enough to want to know what happens, but hardly anything does, and when it does, it's usually told in flashback in a couple paragraphs. Then the book ends with pretty much every single story line left dangling. This is one of those books where it feels like the author decided he was going to write a 1000 page book and then started filling up the pages regardless of whether it meant for a good story or good writing. It's basically a soap opera and it can hook you in to see what happens, but just like a soap opera, the payoff is incredibly unsatisfying.

0140103112|4.0|This book pleased us greatly and created great peals of laughter while we wondered what some of the words meant.  My 7th grader read the book himself in a few hours then I read it aloud to my 3rd grader, omitting certain parts that I did not want him to hear.  Certainly this book is worth reading aloud - we talked about it for days afterwards.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I read some of the one-star reviews and have come to realize two things: a) They got a different \\"Pacific\\" than I did, or b) they're insane. This series was brilliant. As good if not better than Band of Brothers. As a person from a long line of Marines I found it very enjoyable. Highly recommend anyone who enjoyed Band of Brothers to buy this. Some of the things in most one-star reviews are made up simply to make The Pacific look bad, because I haven't seen any of what is described.

B0028R3NCU|5.0|Hi    I have three of these. Work great with my 4, 8, and 32Gb micro SD cards. No issues except you have to look at it before you plug it in as it's possible to plug in upside down. I haven't found a USB stick as small as one of these with a micro SD card.    I use one to port stuff too and from work computers and bringing software and firmware files with me to service calls. I also use them for booting live linux distros.    I coloured the \\"up\\" sides white with correction fluid and marked them with a black magic marker to identify which SD card is normally in each reader.    Much better than the slightly larger cheap Chinese card reader I bought.    Magic

B00275EHJG|1.0|Here's the thing, I have loved all the Pixar movies except for this one, I even enjoyed this one to a point.  It was nice to see old familiar characters interact, and it was interesting to see how things were looking for their future.      However, I feel that I spent the last 20 minutes of the movie being lectured.  It made me feel upset and uncomfortable, because yes growing up is about leaving things behind and moving on, but here is the biggest issue for me, I don't believe that you have to give up EVERYTHING of your childhood to grow up and that is the point that these characters are forced into by the story.     When I go to a movie, I go for the fantasy, for the happy ending, was the ending of the movie realistic? Yes...  did I want to know that most children when they go off the college give up all their innocence and are dumped into a world of self sufficiency with basically no guidance?  No I did not.    Childhood is important and the ability to keep some of that childlike wonder and imagination is part of being an innovative and adaptive adult.      Will I ever recommend this movie to anyone? The answer is no, will I ever let my children see it?  No... well maybe when they are old enough to make up their own mind, there is no reason to let go of theirs or my innocence completely.

B00127RAJY|1.0|After the button of my jeans completely fell off whilst getting dressed, my four-inch \\"muffin top\\" subtly implied it was time to perhaps diet ad exercise. My palate consists of Taco Bell and McDonalds, and my idea of cardio is taking the stairs instead of the elevator, and I'd really do anything to lose weight except eat healthy and run a few miles. I decided to check out the 30 Day Shred anyway, because I would really like to be able to fit into my favourite sweatpants again.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this exercise DVD was far too difficult for someone like myself. Being a chain smoker, I was completely gasping for air within the first 30 seconds of this video. I think Jillian should be more sensitive to smokers; those who smoke up to three packs a day like myself will find this simply impossible. Also, I was drenching in sweat before the five minute mark. I couldn't walk to my computer desk afterward, and was paralyzed on the floor like a beetle turned on it's back. I found it so difficult to waddle comfortably that I used my cousin's electric scooter for the following three days.<br /><br />I advise others in the same position as me to not give up hope, but simply embrace your body. Chicken and waffles? Yeah boy! There are a lot of \\"Chubby Chaser\\" websites out there too, you know.. ;)

B00003CX9E|1.0|As a film connoisseur, I knew I'd have to watch Citizen Kane at one point; not because I wanted to, in fact I was actually dreading it, but I've heard so much talk about this Orson Welles \\"masterpiece\\" that I was curious to see what the hoopla was for for myself. If you're asking why I was dreading seeing this film, it is because to date I am not keen on older things. Besides my lack of interest in black and white films, admittedly I find books and music from my parent's youth to be of little relevance. However, I still went ahead and watched Citizen Kane with an open mind.<br /><br />I was unable to watch this film in one sitting, because I kept falling asleep near the twenty minute mark. By the third time I was finally able to finish it.. I was completely underwhelmed, and actually disgusted. Disgusted with all the praise it has acquired, disgusted by the lack of action, disgusted by how much Orson Welles was consumed with his own ego and pretension. In simplest terms, Citizen Kane is outdated babble, trying to convey a message but only coming out as empty talk, where it's only value lies in nostaglia (like \\"Pulp Fiction\\".)<br /><br />For films that act as powerful monologues on the trials and tribulations of man, view \\"Salt\\", \\"The Book of Eli\\", \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\", most M. Night Shymalan works, or \\"The Runaways\\".
0061906220|5.0|Visiting my granddaughter's daycare (which is run exactly like a school), my husband and I witnessed a really jubilant reaction as the teacher read \\"Pete the Cat\\" to the kids along with the tape which includes the song & music. These kids are all around 18 months old and they danced and beamed to the whole thing and every time the teacher finished, they would shout, More! More!.\\" The teacher played the tape and read the story 5 times in a row. Nobody got tired of it including my husband and I. We were dancing with the kids and singing along, too. I cannot possibly recommend this book & story more for any child over 12 months or so. I would definitely get the tape along with the book, as the song Pete sings after each time he steps into a different color is delightful and easy for kids to learn and repeat. I can't wait for this man's next book.

B000004756|5.0|I really love Friday Night in San Francisco. That album is one fiery set of demonstrable guitar chops by Di Meola, McLaughlin and De Lucia. Still, despite all the energy and the lightening quick fret and fingering work the crowd noise actually takes away some of the joy of experiencing the album in my livingroom. Also, Friday Night...is kind of short. For my money, The Guitar Trio recorded in 1996 at Real World Studios in England is the best record by these guitar masters. I wish these guys would get back together. If guitar music is your thing, get this. Incendiary!
1601251556|4.0|Summary:    Solid all-purpose D20 game mat. Construction materials are slightly lacking, but mat is still highly functional.    Pros:    Cheap price, erases and draws well. Two sided; I can have one map on the front and one on the back (very useful). Since both sides have a different color, you can match them to indoor or outdoor locations, if you so chose.    Cons:    Mat is essentially a durable cardstock with a plastic laminate. Although I haven't had it long enough to know, I could imagine that one would see joint-breakage if the map was folded frequently.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Having been disappointed with the current film of \\"Jane Eyre\\" (2011) which completely (and unexplainably) downplayed the mystery and seemed overly somber and dully colored, and never having thought that the Orson Welles version hit the mark (one is just too aware of the Welles persona), I was absolutely delighted to find this version of the great novel. I just have no criticisms (except- like every version- the St. John Rivers section is a bore- that's not this movie's fault- that's Charlotte's fault). I believe this was originally a Masterpiece Theatre mini-series. Here it is a 2-disc movie. It's just almost flawless. The mystery is beautifully presented- hints of it beginning from the moment Jane appears at Thornfield. The romance is handled so very well- the ambiguity of the way Rochester treats Jane, their long and strange and intimate talks, the growing kinship and the way in which the passion finally flares out- wow. The casting is sublime, the cinematography simply beautiful especially in the outdoor sequences set by the river. It's a wonderful version of a book that's difficult to film because it's so challenging to truly capture such a great book. By the way, if you haven't already read the book- DO NOT SEE ANY MOVIE VERSION OF THIS BOOK UNTIL YOU'VE READ IT. It is one of the finest English novels ever written and it would be a great shame for anyone to miss out on the reading experience beforehand.
B00005NTJM|5.0|As things turned out \\"This Was\\" proved to be a prophetic title for Jethro Tull's debut album because it differs from subsequent Tull albums not only in personnel but musical direction as well.  Like many British groups of the time, Jethro Tull started out as a blues-rock band but with jazz overtones. One track on the album is a Rahsaan Roland Kirk piece entitled \\"Serenade to a Cuckoo\\" with impressive jazz flute playing by Ian Anderson.        This album is more of a group effort than the following Tull albums with blues guitarist Mick Abrahams having a prominent role. \\"Move on Alone\\", sung by Abrahams, is the only Jethro Tull vocal song not sung by Ian Anderson. Abrahams left after this album to form the blues/jazz/rock band Blodwyn Pig.       As other reviewers have pointed out, this album is a blues-rock classic.
B00000AOUD|5.0|While other prog/rock groups of the 70s like Yes and Genesis and the less famous Van Der Graaf Generator noodled away and came up with the odd interesting musical bit here and there on their \\"concept albums\\" Jethro Tull created the real deal, the amazing, and indescribably brilliant Thick As A Brick. Others have discussed here how Aqualung had been falsely labelled a concept album by some critics. So, Ian Anderson and company decided to compose what he would call \\"the mother of all concept albums.\\" It's a joke within a joke, a riddle within a riddle, a comic book depiction of a cruel world, supposedly based on a long, naughty poem by British child protegy Gerald Bostock. What we have with Thick As A Brick is one 45 minute song that was divided into two sides of a record album in 1972. And what a tour-de-force musically and lyrically! Thick As A Brick is like a freight train hurtling towards you at lightening speed. The album is brimming with layered, complex music, with odd time signatures and switch-ups. It's filled with loud and soft passages, acoustic guitar, lots of flute, swirling organs, lilting lutes, piano, excellent drums and percussion and memorable electric riffs from the incomparable Martin Barre. On the album Anderson (or Bostock :)) broods and pontificates on everything from organized religion, the general cruely of the world, to the impact of over-bearing parents. It's at turns almost pastoral, then suddenly heavy as hell. As with all great progressive rock albums, there are colours of jazz and classical music. It's a most appealing, robust, fragrant stew of an album. Anyway, make sure you buy the re-mastered version of Thick As A Brick which includes the entire album with better sound, a portion of a live performance at Madison Square Garden and a recent interview with Ian Anderson, Martin Barre and Jeffrey Hammond on the making of Thick As A Brick. Essential!!!

B000TZCSE2|4.0|Unfortunately, I did not know there was even a short story called I Am Legend before I saw the movie. I thought the movie was so-so, but now that I have read Matheson's awesome story, I hate the movie for not staying true to the book and missing the mark. Shame on you, Hollywood. This story is intense, gripping, and unique. The main character, Robert Neville, is a likable character who I became invested in quickly. My only semi-complaint is that the scientific talk went over my head, but I didn't feel like it made me appreciate the story less. I love Matheson's take on the vampires and the imagine of \\"Neville, come out!\\" was absolutely haunting. It had good twists and I loved the ending. It seems like in today's society every vampire story(or scary movie)is pretty much all the same. Originality is hard to come by these days. It's interesting that a story written in the 50's is more fresh and solid that anything I've read (or seen) in quite awhile. Bravo Matheson!
B00466HN68|3.0|The movie is ok. Jake is worth watching. The plot holds no surprises. The whole thing is better than expected. And these days that ain't bad.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Robert Downey is quickly impressing me that he may be the most versatile actor of the past few years. When you compare this role with Sherlock Holmes and his performance in Tropic Thunder, you'll understand what I mean if you didn't immediately. All three roles are very different, yet he delivered them expertly, and with a combination of real drama and real humor in each of the three.<br /><br />In &#34;Iron Man&#34;, he elevates what could have been just another comic book hero movie with his completely engaging performance. Let's face it, even tho I was a comic book fan, and like these movies, their numbers in recent years has approached overkill. The first Spiderman movie was revolutionary, but the next two were nothing more than continuations of the first. The first Hulk movie was wretched, and even tho the second was an improvement, Edward Norton didn't bring the personality to the character that Bill Bixby did in the TV series. The Fantastic Four was interesting but quickly forgotten The X-Men series was a cut above, and so was Iron Man.<br /><br />However, without Downey's performance Iron Man might have tanked as badly as the first Hulk. The story is nothing very surprising, and the &#34;surprise&#34; and ending are nothing but predictable. However, Downey's Tony Stark is alive. When he feels we feel. When he seduces a reporter, its all very natural and predatory. When he has troubles with the suit, his alarm infuses us as does the slapstick of his early mistakes. He is charming, infuriating, and at times completely blind to what is going on around him. All very human.<br /><br />I hold back one star because the story REALLY could have used a lot more imagination. Downey's performance almost hides that flaw ... almost.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004EPYZQM|5.0|This is just a great film. It's fun, it's loud, it's got story, and it's got gorgeous girls and amazing cars. That's the recipe for an awesome blockbuster. I'd heard the hype, and had always planned to see it, but I didn't know it would be as good as it was. it was just bada**. I came to Amazon the minute it was over to try and pre-order the Blu-ray--it is that good. Sure, it's cliche a lot of the time, but cliche doesn't have to be a bad thing. If you liked the original film then this is right on par with that--I think it's even better.I can't wait for the 6th one to come out!

B004SEVPWQ|4.0|The game is a satisfactory alternative to real billiards.  I am only one day into playing it, but the only issue I have so far is the ability to adjust where the cut ball is struck.  Also, the lines indicating the direction the balls go is a tad too long.

B003QS9WIE|1.0|Not only does this movie last for what seems like 15 years, the extremely talky end scene feels like another 20.  Which wouldn't be so bad if the movie wasn't a boring downer. The \\"secret\\" of the movie is obvious to anyone over 7, and is even revealed 1/3 of the way through. And yet it plods endlessly on, like a truly bad opera. You've got better things to do with 35 years. The choppy flashback structure breaks up the story so much you never get an emotional connection with the characters. Which would be difficult anyway, since they're all repulsive. Not a protagonist among the lot; you're practically rooting for them all to come to a terrible end. The Instant Video rental is especially annoying as the movie is extremely dark and almost impossible to see under home conditions, while the sound is muffled and nearly unintelligible for large sections. I only paid $2 and I feel cheated. Avoid.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I still think Christina needs more acting coaching and I am sad that She's plastic surgery restricts some of her facial movements but god damn they kicked some ass.  The chemistry was so there between everyone and I seldom see that.  Also I'm a sucker for Jazz dancing and this was packed full of it.  Of course Burlesque Jazz dancing but it's still fun to see the loose movements and fluid water like steps.  I hope members of this cast and the director work on something else.  The chemistry is is too good to waste.

0061726826|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this book originally. I saw it being promoted on so many different websites. I read many other reviews and then I decided to buy the book for the heck of it since so many people praised the book. Boy, am I glad I bought this book. It was extremely well written and engaging.     Lena is 95 days away from her procedure and is excited to be rid of the possible disease she can get. While out for a run with her best friend, Hana, she meets Alex, and her world is thrown into chaos. She starts to see what happens to people after the procedure and she begins to question it, and the governments authority. She learns the truth about so many things throughout the novel including her mother, Alex, and especially herself. After following everyone's rules for her entire life she decides to do what makes her happy even if her choices put her in danger.     In Lauren Oliver's dystopian novel everyone accepts what the government does and submits to them. They accept the raids that happen, the procedure that forever alters their lives, and accepts that the disease amor deliria nervosa is truly a danger to them.     What surprised me is that no one would fight back and rebel against the government. The people truly believe that the government has their best interests at heart.     I would say the end came with a surprise twist and I am excited for the next book in the trilogy called Pandemonium I believe.

B000VZIOCK|5.0|This is my new favorite album. It's hard to find really beautiful rock/metal that makes you swoon and wanna bang your head at the same time. The short radio station skits in between songs are funny and add depth to the album, but in general, I'm not a fan of between-song-blurbs. Sometimes you just wanna get to the music. Especially since I've fallen in love with each song on this album.
0307887960|1.0|I stopped reading at page 34 where Dr. Dukan writes that he considers diet sodas to all be \\"great allies in the fight against weight problems\\" and that diet sodas are often \\"the best way to make sure you drink\\" the required amount of liquid.  Surely, this must be a joke?   I thought this book was about losing weight in a way that is good to your body. Encouraging people to drink drinks full of artificial sweeteners, like aspartame, is in no way good for your body. You can lose weight by eating only a chocolate bar a day too, but it doesn't mean it's good for you.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|not only is it a beautiful well made game it works flawlessly on my xoom it's definitely worth. a download.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|This app is really well made with lots of great options, great graphics and very good gameplay. Worth the $$$ but while it's free, jump on it! EVO 4G
B004SEVPWQ|3.0|In game scoring makes sense nearly all games need to have some scoring method. But honestly- who cares? Why would the game keep record of only the most irrelevant score -the aggregate score. The aggregate score is the most worthless info. Why do I care if I have managed to accumulate a large sum of cash if it does me no good? It would make much more sense just to keep of best score for a single frame. To keep track of only the aggregate tells me that I've wasted time greater than the cash total collected. (obviously it doesn't give me total time wasted because I lose money when I lose a game) if you are looking for a pool game that plays like a &quot;lite&quot; version of a full featured game then this is the game for you. Unless you really love pool this game is not worth paying for. Get it free our leave it be.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I've always wondered where the awesome songs in movie trailers came from; and over a year and a half ago I found out. After endless times of listening to songs on YouTube, I finally began to find public albums from Globus/Immediate Music and got them as Christmas gifts. Now I've found TSFH has a public album. My birthday is in 4 weeks, but I can't wait that long! Won't even miss the 8 bucks. Master of Shadows and Freedom Fighter are probably my top favorites, and I'll enjoy introducing myself to the new names on the list.    Highly recommended, and if you're reading this because you're on the fence, Youtube some of the songs! You (hopefully) won't regret it. :)
B004QYZATW|4.0|This film was promoted all wrong. Had it been billed as a comedy, I think reviews would be much better. Very dreamy and romantic with some action thrown in. Glad I finally ignored reviews and gave it a chance! Jolie and especially Depp were wonderful. There was one twist in the plot which I found too far-fetched for comfort, but this is a remake, so I'm assuming this falls in with the original storyline. And it gave me a great laugh.
B0041KW6PC|2.0|It said dvd and blue ray and I didnt get the dvd I just the blueray  that was a rip off I'm really upset
B004LUS390|5.0|This is a great sketch program with far more options than I expected and works great on my Viewsonic gtab. Now I need a great stylus to match this great program.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|This game rocks. The graphics are superb, the physics is great. It's easy to learn and play. Although I got it free today, I think it would be worth the price.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|This is the best app I've downloaded since angry birds. Great graphics, great physics, and well implemented online capabilities. Has all the pool staples, English, back spin, forward spin and full control of ball hit speed. Yes, EULA is weird for an app but I play a lot of console games so its pretty much standard faire.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I remember being a little skeptical about Glee when I first heard about it. While I liked High School Musical ([[ASIN:B001Q3KQ68 High School Musical 1-3]]), I just couldn't picture it off of the Disney Channel. I kept reading that they didn't intend it to be like a musical, but more like real life, with  music incorporated into it. ALL of those doubts vanished when I saw the ultra early first episode that premiered MONTHS before the rest of the show was to come out. I was captured by the characters right away (Mercedes and Rachel remain my favorites, with Santittany and then Finn as close runner's up.), and the music... Oh, there are no words. The music from the entire episode was good, but it was the finale, when they sang Don't Stop Believin' for the first time... That was magic... I had chills, and goosebumps, and I cried and laughed both at the same time... I'm terminally ill, and engaged in a LONG fight for my life. All joy had leeched out of my life in recent months, and Glee was literally a spark that helped to reignite that joy. No lie...<br />  With the sheer power of that one number, I felt... I don't know, almost hopeful. I devoured each week's new episode two or three times, and when Season 1 came to a close, I rewatched the entire season another time or two. Not every episode is equally powerful or funny, but as a collective whole, it's all just solid gold, grade A+, 5 star material. Some of the best writing to come out of TV in years, and some of the best music I have ever heard. And phenomenal acting as well. It's THAT good.<br />  So if there is any part of you wondering if you should give this show that you're hearing all this fuss about a try, you really only need to ask yourself two questions. Do you like music? While this isn't a musical, music is a big part of the plot and the lives of the characters. And secondly, were you any sort of outcast, or geek, or nerd in school? Because if you were, like I was, then this show will resonate with you on an almost spiritual level. It empowers me, and 99 times out of 100, no matter how sick I am feeling, this darn show will make me feel better. Give it a try, and I don't think you'll be disappointed. I should point out, I have managed to talk EVERY friend or family member who is close to me, even those who seem DETERMINED that they will hate the show, into watching the show. Some I had to beg, some I had to bribe. LOL But they ALL loved the show.<br />  Thanks so much for you time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowellon an almost spiritual level.

B000AMJC2K|2.0|Be aware before you by that this arm does not keep the monitor parallel when raising and lowering in contrast to other monitor arms. This has an unfortunate side effect that the axle at the end of the arm can end up at an angle where it has to fight gravity to keep the monitor up, which it isn't strong enough to do, so it flops over unless you align it perfectly.<br /><br />Basically speaking, when you raise the monitor, it is difficult to find a position where it won't flop over, and requires a minute or two of fiddling every time to find a stable configuration. If all you are doing is pushing the monitor back and forth on your desk then this might work for you. However, don't expect to be able to raise it and lower it effortlessly. It's a pain. The more expensive arms have this issue solved.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Fabulous rendition of this, my all time favorite musical.  I had never heard of Alfie Boe before I saw this concert on PBS, but now I'm hooked.  His Jean Valjean owned every scene he was in and his voice is unbelievable.  I have since bought several of his CD's.  Norm Lewis was stunning as Javert, one of the few Javerts I've seen (I've seen the show 10 times) who I really felt for.  Ramin Karimloo is an excellent Enjolras and gives a far better performance in this concert than Michael MacGuire did in the 10th anniversary concert.  Many people have knocked Nick Jonas' performance as Marius.  I have to agree in part.  I did not care for him in the first act but his \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" redeemed him.  He's no Michael Ball, but he wasn't as terrible as some say.    The encore alone is worth the price of the DVD.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|if you miss the free app day on this don't hesitate this game provides a very robust pool game with online multiplayer. great gfx and controls. highly recommend!
B00004T0US|5.0|This was ordered as a Christmas present. It arrived on time and the person I gave it to loved it.
B004SEVPWQ|3.0|Hmmm...so this is a game about billiards, not about breaking swimming pools. What a load of false advertising. Next it will be a app to help with bills and it wot even involve a ducks beak. Thanks but no thanks.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|okay its now May 1st in New York may I please please have the new update? this game is so addictive. I've cleared every episode and now I'm waiting for this episode so may i please have the new update
B004EC5IV6|5.0|This is an excellent mashup of the original series, the manga, and a little something new. Effectively wraps up to perhaps episode 25' of End of Evangelion, so looking forward to the next two, if they ever get made. Not sure how they couldn't.
B004GHBQ7O|3.0|Green day rules live but the concert is incomplete, went to see one concert from the 21st century breakdown tour, it lasted 3 hours and must be one of the best concerts of my life, so i was very excited about this blue ray. To my big disapointment they cut out a lot of songs, i dont know if it was because of commercial reasons they didnt put the complete setlist but they should have. It would have been nice also to see live performances from different countries. It is still a good concert worth seeing but could have been a lot better.
B0030ZOYJ0|3.0|This seems hardly worth it. Not as good as the original series, and all of the fights are just of a monster of the week variety. That said, they are pretty, but one wonders if they couldn't have made a better first movie.    Buy Eva 2.22 if any of them.
B0033V51QG|4.0|Frankl reprises a remarkable circumstance, his experience in German Work/Death Camps during WWII and his inspiring quest to find meaning amid daunting nearly unimaginable oppression.  Functions better as a critique of Frankl's psychotherapy predecessors (Freud) than as a tract promoting the unique virtues of logotherapy. Worthy book for those of \\"greatest generation.\\" For \\"boomers,\\" my coming of age, I would suggest Ernest Becker's \\"The Denial of Death\\" serves as a more cogent testament and comprehensive critique.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have to thank my friends for recommending this DVD to me.  WOW, I have never had such quick results from a workout!<br /><br />I had a second baby and as most people say, it's harder to take the weight off the second time, so this DVD was exactly what I needed to get my body back into shape.  I did not follow the \\"directions\\" and do it every day.  The first time I did level 1 I had never worked out so hard, or ever been so sore!  (and I'm not a novice exerciser!)  But I kept at it, every few days, or every other day.  Basically I do it 2-3 days a week, and on off days do some other cardio.  I stayed with level 1 for a while, but then moved to level 2, where I thought I would never make it through!  However, same thing, every other day or so I did the routine and of course by now I had already been seeing results, but I started losing faster, I think because it's a more intense workout.  What I do when I start a level, I just do as much as I can do, and then usually in about 6-8 weeks I am doing everything no problem at expert level and my body has adjusted and I'm ready to move on.  So again, after about 8 weeks I moved to level 3, which is VERY intense.  Again, I am seeing more amazing results.<br /><br />I could not be happier with this dvd and my results!  It works every body part, with the 1-2-3 routines.  And I love that these are each only a half hour circuits.  Because with 2 kids and a busy schedule, that's about all I have most days!  I've already bought a few other of her dvd's but have yet to do them.  But I am hooked on the 1-2-3 program, and  the dvd's that have 2 or 3 levels of workouts.  I credit losing my 25lbs all to the Shred!
0812966066|5.0|First Sherlock Holmes story I've ever read. I actually really enjoyed it. For anyone who's never read Sherlock Holmes and is afraid they won't understand the language (the thought I had before I actually read one), it's actually very easy to understand (I didn't realize it's actually written in pretty understandable English). There's plenty of dialogue that moves you through the story rather quickly and it's not boring in any way. There are some funny parts, and you'll have fun trying to figure out the mystery.
038533348X|3.0|Cat's Craddle is a story about a reporter chasing after the family a Mr. Hoenikker, one of the scientists behind the creation of the atomic bomb.  I read this book while taking AP US History and could make many connections which helped make the book interesting. There were some parts in the book that seemed to drag on while others were quick reads. At many point I told myself that I was going to stop reading but then an interesting part came and I could not put it down. The book does jump around a lot which at times make things difficult to follow. Although it does not jump around as much as Slaughterhouse Five there is a strange fluidity that is created that puts a damper on the usual Vonnegut books. It is almost to fluid to make the book interesting.
B001O1O71C|4.0|Lovely book about childhood friendship. I knew the ending was going to be awful, but I didn't know what was going to happen. Terribly sad.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Using the now laughable filming style of \\"Blair Witch\\", we found the movie more annoying than \\"inspired\\".  The characters were steriotypes of the current pack of 20/30 year olds and were not sympathetic at all, infact we started wagering as to who was going to do something stupid enough to get themselves killed - the best one being the \\"camera-man\\" who was so oblivious that he never noticed a 100+meter creature had snuck up opon him, really.    The monster itself was never explored, infact it took an extra feature to even reveal that the creature was a hatchling.  All in all it was another example of Hollywood using the creature as simply a McGuffin Device - simply something to build a weak story around.  Even the Brits got it right with \\"Gorgo\\" by  following the Japanese in showing that monsters can be characters in their own story and often have a natural cause for their behavior, often enough to make the viewer wonder just who the real \\"monsters\\" are - a creature somehow wronged by man or man himself for not taking responcability for his mistakes.  This feeling is compleatly missing in this first person POF rippoff of a movie.    Rent it before you buy it - you'll save money.
0743270754|5.0|This book is very well written. I have gained a better understanding of Lincoln and his presidency. I have come away from it understanding not only was Lincoln a great president, but also a shrewed politician which made him a great politician as well.
