B004SJ3AXI|5.0|ok, I love this but, I'm blonde so I cant get past the first level on any of them so I am determined to pass the first level. I am DERTEMINED:)
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good graphics and fun to build your city.  I like being able to choose when I want to upgrade. Fun game.
B003R1B9MW|5.0|As an avid golfer I really loved this movie--great acting, great music and great special effects.  I think even non-golfers would enjoy it.  I've seen it about 5 times and will do so again.  It has laughter, sadness and many emotional segments.  It was well worth it on all accounts.
B0086700CM|5.0|hella addicting game, 5 mill niqqas. that would be my highscore by the way. so uh yeah. Umm, have fun.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is wool addicting I play it all day everyday! I never even buy anything because I get bored when I do! whoever made this game is a genius and I hope to see more from them SOON!
B0086700CM|4.0|so much fun. I was so happy when amazon had this. Amazing :)<br />Me and all of my friends play this all the time u should definatly get this.
0071624058|1.0|If you need more practice,this book is not for you. Try barron or kaplan.They have enough practices and they explain all the questions.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the holy Bible app is great. u can read it on the go or you can have the word read to you while you listen. I think that's really good.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|theyre remaking another cult classic.  shocker.  but this one was actually good!  i spit on your grave (1978) was a cult classic but a remaking of this film was either going to be a hit or a miss.  it was a hit! boy was it ever!  maybe even more violent than the original.  the only thing this film will never capture that the original did was the power of the rape scene in the 70's.  this rape scene seemed a little too cut.  not that im saying or condoning women getting raped in movies but im jsut saying the 70's rape scene was far more powerful.  but besides that the murder scenes and the acting by all was done well and i really am failry impressed with it all.  KEEP THE GOOD REMAKES COMING!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really good game...cost is cheap...no ads. I really reccomend this vane because the music layout setting (everything)  is just fantabulous! You should yet it...seriously.
B004SIP9MY|5.0|this horror film is a classic. its a smart clever movie that really illustrates the elements of horror.  for example, one of the characters explains the RULES is horror movies and it is so true.  when a girl is running up the stairs from a killer instead of running out the front door or saying \\"i'll be right back,\\" when u know you wont be right back and youll be dead.  its full of black comedy, and alot of irony when characters explain what not to do in horror movies, when they do that exact thing.  the cleverness and humor never gets old and it keeps you guessing till the very end.  very good film for fans of older horror flicks and fans of horror in general.
B0086700CM|5.0|Ok so most people have heard of Temple Run...but you cant find it on your android device(s). Well its finally here...and its free! I really recommend this game and encourage you to get it.
B004SIP9O2|3.0|im not gonna say this was a \\"bad\\" sequel as much as i would say it was unneeded.  STOP READING THIS IF U HAVENT SEEN THIS.  SPOILERS!!!  now to all who have seen this, lets get back to it.  billy's mother.  really?  REALLY?  never gave u any clues to guess that!  besides her accomplice anyways.  alot of the suprises and excitement we saw in the first are dulled down and not even enjoyable in this one.  the witty humor we grew to love now is overplayed or abscent throughout as well.  all in all, good for what it was, but certainly unneeded and can never compare to the original.
B00003CXIY|5.0|this movie is good for some laughs and has an awesome story to follow. its full of surprizes and at the same time is as good as you expect. :)
B004SIP9P6|2.0|scream 2 was eh, this one?  NO.  sidney had a brother.  shocker!  how would we know that and how could we guess that?  a complete cheat of a suprise ending.  and the whole blowing up of the house and the fax machine scene?  impossible!!  this movie is just very unrealitic, not funny, not clever just plain stupid.  very dissapointed.
630529142X|5.0|this is an amazingly funny adam sandler movie. a must see for everyone. it really is great. if you are trying to decide to watch it or not... you should watch it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best!!!!!  i have played it none stop!  finaly it comes to kindle!!!!!  get this game u will luv it soooooooo much!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is super fun and challenging. There's hard and easier parts. But its a very fun game. I recommend it to anyone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I was about to purchase the books I wanted to first make sure that I didn't invest in books that would disappoint me in the end and when I found out E.L. James believes in happily ever after I bought the books.  In this installment there is more story and maybe less sex. As with the other books this one keeps you hooked and reading always wanting to know what's going to happen next.  I learned to like her mischievous inner goddess without whom we wouldn't have all that steamy fun.  Christian Grey has become my third all time favorite male character after Parker Evans in Sandra Brown's Envy and Maximillion from Victoria Holt's On the Night of the Seventh Moon. I'm now reading the trilogy over again as I'm not yet ready to say goodbye to Ana and Christian.<br /><br />On the downside I would have liked to know what the problem was between Ethan and Mia as it was mentioned often and never resolved to my satisfaction.  I also would have liked to attend Kate's wedding.  I wasn't fond of this books style of shifting from the present to the past then back again.  I would have preferred a straightforward narrative.  Those are minor complaints though and they didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying the book.  I hope this isn't the last we hear of Mr. & Mrs Grey.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game its addictive and fun as well I would reccomend it to all that love running games
B001PBEJL4|5.0|I first saw this movie on tv in the very early 1970's and it immediately became one of my favorites.  If you are one for modern cinematography, then you may not appreciate this movie as much.  It was filmed in the late 1960's and does lack some of today's special effects.  However, if watching old movies, to include musicals, brings you joy, then you can not go wrong with \\"Camelot\\".  To me, the story that is portrayed, the costumes, and the acting of Richard Harrris and Vanessa Redgrave are what make this movie one of the all time classics. This is a movie for the romantic at heart and the blu-ray edition makes it even better for home viewing.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I have seen lots of negative reviews of this product, I have to disagree with all of them.<br /><br />Pros. Perfect fit on my head, I have a big head. My ears are big too, they fit inside perfectly. This is a great upgrade for me, I got them at 20 dollars, great price for the perks this offers. I recommend this item.<br /><br />Cons: A bit big, but I am big two, I only use them at home so I dont care.<br /><br />Overall great headset for the money.
1846555248|5.0|With in the first few pages of this book I knew that this was going to be something special. First off the timeline was set in the late 1800's to the early 1900's. A very beautiful era in history. Then you add magic and a wonderful writing style and wah-lah! A book so amazing that you wish it would go on forever.<br /><br />Several reviews have mentioned that the timeline jumps around a lot and there are a lot of main characters, but if you just go with it and enjoy the ride, and not try to worry about keeping it all straight in your head, then it feels like the magical circus itself.<br /><br />I loved the slightly dark and seductive world of the Night Circus and the sweet romance of the dueling illisionists. I also loved the detail and collection of interwoven storylines. Every time I opened this book I was swept up into a differnt place and time relishing every detail.<br /><br />Ms. Morgenstern is a fabulous writer and truly paints a detailed sensory world where you truly feel as if you could touch the fabric she descibes or tast the carmel apples. If you only have time to read one book this year, then read The Night Circus, because it is pure magic!
B007SGM084|5.0|I bought this book not knowing what to expect...I was pleasantly surprised! I enjoyed getting to know the characters and how their love would blossom throughout the books. While some will say that the telling of their sexual exploits were unnecessary I found them to be an insight into the characters minds; learning more about them from their own fears to desires and willingness to try or do \\"more\\" because you are that in love with someone. To give in to your own insecurities...that's the kind of love you want to find or have. I think that's what the story is about...don't get me wrong it was hot and steamy but after reading it again I find myself wanting to have this type of intimacy with someone...making me more confident with myself, my body and my sexuality like Christian does for Ana. Or how Ana loves Christian unconditionally for all his fifty shades...that to me says true love...it's hard dand a lot of compromise but both are willing because of their love!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|OMG this book seriously screwed with my emotions in a great way. I read one minute and was loving the romance part of Travis and Pigeon, then the next minute I read and was like OOOO Travis you a jerk... It was well written and thought out! Jamie was brilliant with the way she kept the book going, I could not put it down and read it in one day and when I finished I wanted so much more of Travis and Pigeon. I can only hope that Jamie puts out a 2nd book to this one I cant wait to read it if that happens. I don't want to give out any specifics and be a spoiler here in my review. But I can say without a doubt I loved this book and could not put it down and am eager to read more of Jamie's work, she is brilliant.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Loving this game good for kids of all ages.  very fun helpful hints very fun.  I have a five year old and she loves this game and is doing very well has a huge village
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it woo much everyone should have this app<br />ive waited forever for amazon to get this app!<br />its really awesome<br />to everyone who reads this:<br />GET THE APP ITS THE BEST<br />#BOSSAPP(:
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best game ever!  I have been. waiting forever to have the game for kindle fire! I used to check the store everyday to see if it was thee. I stopped and then I checked it and it was here!  Thank u God sooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My pray has been answered!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and from my high score it love me finnally somtjing good in the app store yay
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put any of these three books down! Be prepared to relinquish a week of your life. You'll be able to do nothing else once you start this triology!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is AMAZING u have to get it....but sometimes when i dont have wifi it lags....a lot.....but still amazing
0861714911|5.0|This book has been very helpful. If you are a noob to Buddhism i recommend reading this book to start you off on your journey.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I use this mic for preaching every Sunday as a low-cost solution for a lavalier. In a small church, with a small sound system with a low budget, the mic picks up and produces sound at a high quality (given your sound guy knows what he's doing). It's not ideal if you tend to walk around the stage when you speak as I often do since the wire tends to get caught in between your shoes.<br /><br />TIP: You usually want to switch out your batteries after each session. I bought a 100 pack of batteries here on amazon for only 5 dollars. The batteries last at least 10 hours.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is an amazing trilogy. The story catches you as soon as you start reading it. I would definetly recommend these books
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app should be preloaded on every phone. Hmmm, who would have the courage to do it? We would certainly find ourselves in a much better world.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you are going to read fifty hades of grey please make the commitment to reading all three books. Without reading every volume you will not be able to see the whole picture and it will surprise you guaranteed!  It was not hard for me to get though them all and each is different in its own right. Very good story from the first page to the last. Try to keep your mind free of judgment because it is not about someone being forced into a scenario she does not want, it is about an unorthodox relationship that twists and turns and the choices that each of us makes in life....it is all about choices....great story well worth the read....
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Young girl, college graduate, meets billionair and goes ga-ga. There could be a story here, but the author could not seem to find it. All she could manage was the sex. Terrible book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I promise you'll be hanging out of your seat!!!!!BEWARE once you enter and take the idol you MAY never come back!?!?!?!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I have a Kindle Fire and all of my friends have iPod touched so Ive had to take theirs to play! So excited when Amazon got it! Again I love this game! So addictive! &lt;3
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Was not impressed with this book......porn really...wanted to see what all the fuss was about..not worth the money I spent!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|one of the best games in the app store right now. as deserving of five stars as anything else .
B005KELQEU|5.0|This case is fine. The only thing odd about it is, it seems as if it should be for a left-hander, the way the logo and the zippers are.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is very reliable and easy.. I love it. the numbers are big and easy to see. I would recommand it
B0059FBQWW|2.0|The vocals are great except for the screamer.  It just doesn't fit the melody and ruins the album.  It could have been so much better without that!  I understand the genre, and get that screamo has its place- it, like growling, can provide a great emotional emphasis for some things IF it is kept brief and not overused... which it is, to the point it ruins otherwise awesome music.  Favorite tracks were Amaranthine (but it too is ruined with overboard screaming) and 1,000,000 light years (which actually could have effectively used screaming, but fell short by using way too much).  If you want female fronted metal, or even a duet, this could have been it without the 3rd guy screaming his lines.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game.is awesome because I have been waiting for ever for kindle and it is much better than I thought.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|This is supposedly the last book that Michael Crichton was working on, before he died. I hate to say it, but I think it would be better if it was left unfinished...<br /><br />I'm an avid fan of Mr. Crichton's work and because of that I was very excited to see how this book would turn out. I have seen reports saying that, when discovered, the book was only about 30% finished. Richard Preston was chosen to finish what Mr. Crichton had begun.<br /><br />You can tell that the approach and story concepts are in line with what you would expect of other works of Michael Crichton: advanced technology, that we may almost have today; complications arising out of problems with said technology; a group of individuals that is forced to deal with consequences of it's use and try  to stay alive as best as possible, while they struggle against a set (deadly) deadline.<br /><br />Unfortunately that's about all that remains... And, truth be told, I could get that much from the back-cover description and be just as happy as when I read the book.<br /><br />Because while the framework is there, the content is severely lacking. All the little details that we have learned to expect and love from Mr. Crichton's stories are simply either not there or are extremely superficial. Characters, especially the main villain, have very little depth. Up to the point that you have to wander how they ever managed to get to the current point in their lives if they were consistently making same kind of irrational decisions like the ones in the story. Dialogues are flat and descriptions at times seem repetitive and redundant.<br />All in all the whole experience makes reading this book into something that Mr. Crichton's works never were: tedious.<br /><br />The end result is a profound disappointment. It looks like Mr. Crichton's name was exploited to make some easy money for the publishers without any thought whatsoever to actually keeping the quality to par with his other works.<br />The book on it'sown would not be bad per-se, but in its current form it simply is not worthy of Mr. Crichton's name.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is awesome and I was so siked about the space version it was awesome but the only thing I don't like about this game is some levels
B008469DGY|5.0|well worth the money you pay for games so few are worth the money or time if you do like a game that is a good deal of fun give this a try
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun.....but I wish it included instructions for some of the games . Overall a good free app that will keep you entertained
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so happy they finaly got temple run I lobe this more than a lot of things and I cant wait Roget back to playing it please buy it is just that amazing
0345803485|5.0|I must say, I am mpressed with this body of work. As a wife and mother who is often caught in the daily rountine of cleaning, working, and taking of family, this book was a great distraction. I found my heart racing and time passing quickly. This book is great for an unrealistic fun read. It will also spice your relationship as well.
B0086700CM|5.0|good thing the game came out on the kindle fire already I have been waiting long enough hahahaha amazing and addicting game
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! It's highly addictive! Keeps me entertained!!! I'll definitely keep this one on my kindle!!! A must have!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is VERY ADDICTIVE!!! I love it!! When you get a new high score you always want to keep going to reach a higher score. It works Great on the KINDLE FIRE! I am glad that they FINALLY put it on the appstore. I have been waiting for it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read.  It was awesome.  Fifty shades of intrigue sex and romance. Kudos to the author. Can't wait to read her next book.
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg This Game Is The Best Game Ever! Its Not Complex Or Anything And Its Kind Of Addictive But Its Still AHH~MAZING!!!(:
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun just to kill time. have some trouble with the touch screen motion. can be too slow. aside from that my kids and I like the variety
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really liked the \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy and story.  This series features good characterizations, excellent speculation concerning a possible post-apocalyptic and unjust society, and generally excellent writing by the author.  The first volume is dazzling.  This third volume in my opinion drags quite a bit in the middle, and could have used more editing.  I wanted to love this third novel in the series.  Instead, I only liked it. Still, those who enjoyed the first two novels in the series will not want to miss this one. RJB.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This book was difficult to get into initially, then took off into a wonderful story. A bit strange reading interaction in letters as a book, but turned out to be very interesting. Would recommend it to all starting bookclubs.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Another great album by the Boss.  Saw him in concert last month.  It was transformative, as it always is.  Great stuff!
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|I had seen an interview of Gina Carano and found her so enlightened in her thinking that I looked her up on youtube. She was a mixed martial artist champion -seeing her training on youtube video shocked me because she has so much physical strength and yet is so very feminine. Sooooo, I attended the movie - interesting adventure story. time flew, and incidently has Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas starring in film with her.<br />I liked seeing a female who wasn't a helpless victum  It was a real story too, not just great action.
0345803485|2.0|Not sure of the hype for this book maybe young people have just not read some of the greater 'romance' novels and think this is new and trendy.  First Ms James English 'accent' comes over in her writing particularly in the beginning in her choice of wording.  Surprise,the character telling the story isn't British and is in school in Portland, Oregon.  That throws me off immediately - poor editing.  Actually if would have made more since  were it set in London. I am intrigued by the story but it is painful to read.... not by the submission crap but by the poor way it is written.  When I purchase a book I expect better.
B007JUWM64|1.0|The only thing this rendition of the film had in common with the Three Musketeers, of any kind, were the names of the characters. Except for Milady, which isn't even a name.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This app is a fun way to play with my grandkids from a distance, we live three hours apart so we play games on our kindles, and one of our favorites is the drawing game, keeps us busy and laughing for hours.
B0086700CM|4.0|I've been waiting for temple run to come out for a long time. but I thought it would be better.. what I mean is: it had a lot of issues like when you slide your finger the person didn't respond and it froze up making you die. hope this was helpful (:
B0066W1AZK|5.0|it is easy to play and will not allow incorrect moves. I am not a great chess player but I can beat it in the easiest mode, but it is still a challenge.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good Kindle version. I didn't encounter any technical problems while reading the book.<br />As to the book itself, I found it very good, but I think it's main audience is teenagers.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Having read all three of these books my first thought was that they could have been condensed into one quite satisfactorily.  The first one is by far the most interesting.  It is an old-fashioned but modernized version of a \\"bodice ripper\\".  It is an easy read although not for the easily shocked or naive.<br /><br />Some of the erotic descriptions are repetitive and I found myself skipping pages.  Having said that, again, the book is an entertaining read, flows well and once past the explicit sexual passages there is an interesting commentary or questioning of human behavior.  What makes normal, what constitutes deviant?  If it's acceptable to both parties then although it maybe out of the ordinary but does no harm to anyone, either the participants or anyone else, is it acceptable?<br /><br />It certainly provoked a lot of discussion amongst my friends and how can discussing books be a bad thing?
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I've played numerous nonograms and this one is one of the best. There are a great variety of puzzles with varying difficulties. My only gripe is there are times I can't get a square to respond. I keep tapping it but nothing happens. I usually have to click elsewhere then back to the square I wanted to mark. I noticed this happens more when working with the upper left side of the puzzle. Other than that, I love this game and games similar to it!
B004RJMUJO|1.0|do not get it your rewards are ads and it is all the same ss free version  rrpeat do not get  the game
1935670913|5.0|Mr. Locke's book is short, simple and to the point, so I will endeavor to be the same. If you are a self published author, or strive to be, do yourself a favor and BUY THIS BOOK!<br /><br />Some reviewers have unfairly stated that the book is just a lot of bragging about Mr. Locke's success...well, OF COURSE IT IS!!! Mr. Locke has accomplished something that many others only dream of, and now he is sharing the method he used to create that success. Isn't his success the very reason to buy his book and listen to him? YOU BETCHA!!!
B004WKOCP8|5.0|This album is amazing. I must admit that at first, I wasn't the biggest fan and I was quite skeptical. But, after listening a few times, I don't know how one couldn't love this album. It is thought provoking, melodic, and simply beautiful. This album definitely showcases Brandon Boyd's vocals, which is by no means a bad thing!! I would recommend giving this album a chance. It is different from the rest, but bands evolve, and Incubus has done so beautifully.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|OMG! Such an amazing an hysterical movie! You just can't go wrong! Plus Channing Tatum and Johnny Deep, does it get any sexier than those two?
B005SAV9SO|5.0|Some great lines and love Cameron Diaz's role! I've watched this movie a hundred times and it's still just as funny as the 1st time!
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever in life, in world, in universe I was just like that guy in my dreams I traveled there read the series by J.Micheal Blumer to find put best books ever

1423113497|5.0|In the first book of Rick Riordan's Olympian Demigod series, \\"Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief\\" Percy Jackson, a 12-year old boy with ADHD is met with some strange challenges after being kicked out of every school he's attended because of \\"behavioral problems.\\" After getting attacked by what he thought was a mythological monster Percy finds himself in the middle of a disastrous war between the Greek gods. Percy then goes on a quest where he meets new friends and enemies as he's on a deadline to save the world as we know it. I would rate this book 5 out of 5 because it is by far the best out of the whole series! Riordan brings a fresh new story that crosses the lives of Greek gods and modern teenagers which results in an adventurous and hilarious storyline. Everybody should read this book because it's not only educational but it's also full of surprises that will keep readers on the edge their seats!
B003PX85GK|4.0|This album is polished, but mellow -- great for background listening.  If you're into that sort of thing, I highly recommend this album.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is the second book in the trilogy of the Hunger Games, written by Suzanne Collins. In this book Katniss and Peeta have won the games and now are back in their district when they find out that the Capitol is making the games where they will need to go back. This book goes on about their time back in the games. This was my favorite book out of all three of the books in the trilogy. I would recommend this book to people of both genders and all ages. It has action and a little romance in there as well.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is very fun and in my opinion very addictive . theres some kincks that need to be fixed though.
B0086700CM|5.0|It went from a lower number on the chart and within the first couple hours it moved to first and has stayed
B004JN1D2I|4.0|This is a great set of books once you get into and get over there is no single main character but many to giver different perspectives. It gives you great characters to follow but do not get too attached nobody is safe in these series. the books are better than the tv series, but you should watch that too it follows the book the best it can. Must read and enjoy.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is awesome! I can keep track of appointments I have all month or write down memos whenever I want to! Its great and its totally free! I love it! U should def. get it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I almost instinctively press the &quot;run again&quot; button as soon as I die. I love the game!!! the only improvements I can think of are some phisical upgrades to your characters...more than just new skins and power up-upgrades (I like the power up-upgrades a lot!!! neat idea!). I prefer to have my skin to be as upgraded as possible (not just the things he MIGHT get to help him/her out).
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really fun and addicting. everyone was always talking about it on the iphone, but I don't have one. glad it came out for the kindle fire(:
B0086700CM|5.0|when I initially bought this app I thought it wouldn't be as fun as it was a month ago...but man was I wrong. I forgot how fast you get at one point. you have to turn.while in midair sometimes.
B0086700CM|5.0|I first played Temple Run on my friends iPod and then finally got it my Kindle Fire and I haven't stopped playing it since then. It's so addicting!
B0086700CM|5.0|finally they have it! I've been waiting forever for this to come out! now I don't have to play on my friends iPod! yayyyyy! :D

0345803485|1.0|This book was really, really awful.  Confession: I threw in the towel at 80% when I realized every time I sat down with my Kindle I lost the will to live.<br /><br />First, the writing.  I have a high tolerance for bad writing.  I love the Twilight series, if that tells you anything.  I can take a lot in the bad writing department when there's a good story to back it up.  But the repetitive nature of this book was more than I could stand.  \\"Oh my,\\" \\"Holy crap,\\" \\"Oooh, my clenching belly muscles.\\"  ARGH!  The same phrases appear over and over and over and...well, you get the picture.  The writing was at times extremely simplistic, like a middle school kid wrote the book.  Then she'd throw in a word like loquacious.  I could picture her sitting there at her word processor, her handy thesaurus by her side.  The entire book being written in the present tense was distracting as well.<br /><br />Another annoyance was how the main character continually referred to by his first and last name in a way that made her sound like a starstruck 13 year old.  \\"Oh my...Christian Grey is sitting on my bed.\\"  \\"Holy crap...Christian Grey said my name.\\"  This chick is a college graduate?  I don't buy it.<br /><br />Second, the story.  The story did not come close to making up for the terrible writing.  There is nothing interesting about either Anastasia or Christian.  I never could figure out what she saw in him besides his being rich and good-looking.  Considering the rest of the story, that hardly seems enough to justify her actions.<br /><br />We get to hear over and over again how messed up he is emotionally, though not why (perhaps in that final 20% I couldn't make myself read - and really, I don't even care).  And the only way he can have a relationship with her is if it's a Dominant/submissive relationship.  I make no judgments on the sexual relationships of other people and this is not my first foray into the world of BDSM lit.  But the girl is not a submissive.  She's just willing to do things she does not have any desire to do because she's so incredibly desperate to be with this controlling guy.<br /><br />Not only is he controlling, he's basically a stalker, and we're supposed to find this sexy.  He tracks her cell phone to figure out where she is and show up to \\"rescue\\" her.  She flies across the country, specifically telling him it's to get some distance from him so she can think.  He shows up there and joins her and her mom for drinks, uninvited.  The guy is a psycho and she's a pathetic weak little girl with no self-worth.<br /><br />Obviously I have no idea why this book is so popular.  Perhaps it's the shock value of the BDSM sex scenes, but you can find much better examples of those in other books (try Cherise Sinclair).ing to do things she does not have any desire to do because she's so incredibly desperate to be with this controlling guy.<br /><br />Not only is he controlling, he's basically a stalker, and we're supposed to find this sexy.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game. its so addicting. it takes me back to school when we used to play it. oh the memories!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|\\"If you're not willing to give up everything, you've already lost.\\" After a CIA agent is kidnapped there is only one group that can get her out. The US Navy Seals are sent in to extract her. Along the way they discover a threat to the United States and are sent to stop that as well. I will save you from my every war movie is compared to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" speech again because you probably can say it yourself now. I will say that the evolution of war movies is interesting though. The 70's started with movies like \\"Green Berets\\" which is pretty tame and went to \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" which got a little more graphic. Then movies like \\"Platoon\\" came out which changed the way they were made, more internal struggle mixed with realistic war scenes. That was the norm until \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". The hand-held camera feel and the as-if-you-were-there realism really raised the bar and was continued with \\"We Were Soldiers\\". Since then the genre has had some hits and misses but nothing really amazing since. Then this movie comes out. Rather then a full review of this I will just say that you NEED to watch this. Words can not to this justice. The fact that real seals are used in this makes the movie that much more impressive and realistic feeling. The things that they do would be unbelievable if it wasn't what they actually do. I can go on and on about this but if you have to watch one war movie in your life then make it this one. Overall, amazing and intense. One of the best movies of the year. After watching this you will feel more pride and respect for the US military then you already had. I loved it and I highly recommend this movie. I give it an A+
B0086700CM|5.0|This plays well on my Kindle fire.  Fun and relatively easy to get the hang of, until it speeds up!
B004WE01YA|5.0|What a wonderful job was done in making Beauty and the Beast in 3D.  It was like watching it for the first time.  Enchanting!

1401235417|5.0|What is classic:<br />Outstanding anatomical drawings<br />Breathtaking perspectives<br />Exciting page layouts<br />Angst in our hero<br />Printed in USA<br /><br />If you like Spawn, then you will be quite pleased with Greg Capullo's Batman. As a delicious extra, the book has several full-page full-color illustrations and on the back side of the page, the ink drawing sans color.  Those ink-only pages rate five stars on their own.<br /><br />The layouts: For several pages Batman is lost in a maze.  The layout rotates 90 degrees for a two-page spread. And then it rotates again for another two-page spread. Now you are lost in the maze, too.<br /><br />There were a couple of hiccups in the plot.  Someone Batman knows, but does not introduce to the reader, shows up to save him and then disappears from the story.  Perhaps regular Batman readers will know who this is, but I was only puzzled by the episode.  But it moved the plot along, so what the heck.<br /><br />Obviously I love this book. I studied figure drawing with an inker from the 50s who worked for both DC and Marvel.  The artwork of this Batman would meet his standards.  Nuff said.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Even though I knew it would have a sad ending, I could hardly turn off my Kindle.  All those interviews conducted by Eric culminated in a sterling account of a SEAL's life and a tale of the kind of men who belonged to DEVGRU.

0307951529|5.0|It's great to see Chris come out with another book on a topic that is really important to the future of our economy. More people need to explore the possibility of working for themselves instead of relying on others for their income.<br /><br />My favorite part is the depth of data collected and the key points.<br /><br />Most books on starting a business are all about checklists and how to write a business plan.

B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the greatest game ever. I had it on my iphone and finally got it on my kindle:)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Got this as a FAOTD (Free App Of The Day)... completely hooked.  Really works the mind.  If you enjoy Sudoku then you will probably like this.  I made an Excel grid template to recreate a few of the puzzles for my mom to try... she seems to like it as well.<br /><br />TIP:  Definitely helps to have a stylus.

B001GJ2ZP2|5.0|Prior to this purchase, the last lp I bought was a Perry Como Christmas collection.  However, my youngest granddaughter, Skye, is a great fan (aged 5!) of Lady Gaga, and persuaded me to try it.  Although I found it difficult to follow some of the words as her diction is quite poor, I find Lady Gaga to be a feisty young woman, and the singer of some quite jolly and tuneful numbers.  There are certainly some toe-tappers here!  I won't say I'm hooked, but now Skye and I can jig along together to 'Poker Face' - and, after all, what counts most is my granddaughter's smiles.
B0080YGZ20|4.0|Not a bad album. Personally it was, in general, a little too \\"pop\\" for me. I bought the album hoping it would have a little more jazz influence the way \\"Settle Down\\" does. Reminds me of a wide variety of artists at various points from Katy Perry to Prince to Alicia Keyes to Norah Jones to Starf***er. Personal highlights include \\"Settle Down\\", \\"The Build Up\\", \\"Something in the Way You Are\\" and \\"Old Flame\\".<br /><br />Bottom line, if you're looking for something new and fresh, give Kimbra a try. But beware, a song like \\"Settle Down\\" isn't necessarily very representitive of how the rest of the album will sound.
B0086700CM|5.0|there's not much to say about this game it is the best game ever I can play it forever if I didn't have to eat or do anything.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting forever for Amazon to come out with Tmple Run, ever since I played it on a friends i pod.  i dont know why this game is so addicting, but it is!!!!  And its free,... I would've bought this game if they put it up for a price!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to get on the kindle fire!<br />This app has great graphics and is really addicting. It has always been one of my fav. apps on the touch and its now my absolute fav. on the fire!

0385344228|5.0|I recommend this book 100% to anyone who likes a great mystery.  I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this book.  This is the first book I have read by Landay and he made this one hard to put down.  He did a great job of developing believable characters and keeping the story moving.  He also added some unexpected twists towards the end.  Now on to my next Landay book - I hope he keeps writing!!
B0086700CM|5.0|its about time they make it for kindles. I know they have for ipod but its not as hard for kindle fire because its bigger.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a fun, visual alternative to sudoku. It starts out pretty easy, but it gets considerably harder even while in the easy section.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|this game is really fun and entertaining for all ages it does take up quite a bit of space but its well worth it :)
B0030IG0C6|5.0|My 5 year old daughter loves horses and especially unicorns. She has a few My little Pony Unicorns, but she has commented that their horns are very short.<br />I looked at the Breyer Unicorns and even though I am  HUGE fan of Breyer horses, I was concerned that for a 5 year old, if the horse got knocked over once the very long horn could break off leaving me with a very sad little girl.<br />Schleich makes very detailed animal creations and this unicorn is no exception. Her flowers and sparkles give her an an extra special little \\"something\\". Her horn is VERY long with respect to her body with makes my daughter super happy and since the Schleich animals are made of a slightly flexible material there is no fear of the horn breaking. She has carried it all over for the last week and it is no worse for the wear. (We also purchased the standing unicorn foal and it is just as nice as the \\"momma\\".)
B007P3S1AQ|3.0|I found the little boys character to be a little hard to believe.  This is coming from someone who is compulsive and struggles with anxiety and panic.  Even then, I thought it was a little stressful to watch.  The movie is very touching, but be prepared to be very sad.  The ending just left me feeling MORE sad.  So it wasn't really a feel good kind of movie :)  Which I doubt you are expecting it to be.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|its definetly a good game, but I lost interest quickly. I don't really like to draw so that is maybe the reason. its worth it, end of story.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|This is a great movie for children and adults alike. A great story with hilarious comedy. A must see :)
B00846F1YW|3.0|wish you could skip over some sections<br />hard to see some things<br />story is way too slow and somewhat silly<br />worth about a dollar
B004L03B3S|5.0|This movie took me for a grand loop! Not a bad one, a great one. The story line was one that was unexpected and blew me away. I recommend this indie Gem to everyone with an open mind. The story made sense and was easy to follow.  It's an unusual love story, but if anything, its depiction of the all-consuming ecstasy of young love is MORE realistic than most movies are, not less. And I think this is as best review as I can give without giving away the movie!
B007CKNX28|5.0|This is the best music he has put out since White Stripes!!  Check it out!! You have to listen to track 8!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE this game.  It is very addictive and I can't seem to put it down.  I saw some others said they had problems with lagging but I have not had any yet.
0345803485|1.0|Read the first of the series. Not overly impressed. It's a very slow read, and I found it hard to get into. For this stories to take up 3 books seams to me a bit ridiculous. As a fan of women's erotica fiction, I would not classify this as such, it's more of a romance novel. Even the sex was boring. What is making this book so popular, is the promotion it is receiving, that along with the fact that most women never heard of erotica romance. Much better authors out there; such as Maya Banks or Cherise Sinclair
B0086700CM|5.0|I loooovvvvveeeee this game. As soon as I seen it for the kindle I was excited. Sorry to say but I been playing it for 4days straight now. I'm in love.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I bought this game for a family game night.  Played it with my 10 year old son...<br /><br />-PROS<br />*Simple game of chance.  The rules are simple enough.  First to collect 13 brains wins. Get shot 3 times in a turn you lose the brains you collect that turn.<br />*Nice dice.  Very cool looking dice... and has nice weight on it.<br />*You can make some twists to the rules for extra fun.  We added, if you roll 3 brains you get to steal a brain from the top zombie and give it to the lowest, also if you roll 3 runners you lose one of your \\"eaten\\" brains because you were running too fast.<br /><br />-CONS<br />*Simple game... not a game you are going to play for more than 30 mins.<br /><br />-CONCLUSION<br />*I paid $8... fun factor was well worth it.  I plan to use it in our next Halloween Party.  Imagine watching \\"The Walking Dead\\" or zombie flick and every time you see a zombie... you roll the dice to see how many shots, snacks or pee breaks you get...<br /><br />-NOTE<br />*When it comes to board games you shouldn't limit yourselves to just the written rules... The fun part of any of these games is when you make it your own...<br /><br />BRAAAAAIIIINNNSSSSS!!!
B006VA3ZEG|5.0|My friends had told me I would like this series and I finally got around to watching it one weekend. I was so drawn into the cast of characters that I watched a marathon of season 1 and then finished season 2 the next weekend. It is really good, very well written and the cast of characters are very interesting and entertaining.
B0086700CM|5.0|Who couldn't love the classic game of take and go?No levels so no bragging about what level you reached. Also more addicting than Angry Birds.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is series ranks up there with some of the best TV. I love period movies so I knew I would enjoy this but was pleasantly surprised by how much I did. The writers do a really good job of building the cast of characters so that you become drawn into each one. Great show!
B0086700CM|5.0|Omgosh I cant believe they FINALLY got this app in the app store!!!!! I am SOOOOOOOOO happy I'm gonna be playing this game non-stop!!! :)

B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this game as soon as I saw it here, and became addicted.  It is an amazingly difficult game though.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />(p.s. they removed the cheats from the iPod version)
B0063GORYU|5.0|I'm completely hooked. Love this app and find myself playing 4-5 times a day. Fun and addictive and look forward to a break in my day to play!!

B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to be ported to android devices. It's a great game, I highly recommend it.
0345803493|1.0|I hated the 1st book so didn't read any farther into the 2nd or 3rd, no reason too. Badly written, awful story.
B0086700CM|4.0|A cool game but the runner runs too fast and I am not sure how I feel about not having &quot;lives &quot;.  A great and fresh game concept though!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I should have read the reviews before I read these. I kept flipping pages trying to find the story.  Not for the younger reader. Or maybe the older one. I think this author has issues.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Great game, fun to use, can't wait for the comeing soon planet. No problems with down load, fas and ezsy
B002KYKE9Q|5.0|Love it.  I had to buy it to read the entire plum collection.  The in between books are different but they fit the series.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|This is my first time purchasing this CD, and I am totally in love with it. George is real good, wonderful with these songs. I'm now listening to \\"I'd Have You Anytime.\\" I love this song the best- I keep playing it over and over again. I can't believe that he and Bob Dylan worked on this song in 1968-why in the world did the other Beatles not include this with their music? Anyway, I love these songs, they are awesome! I look forward to purchasing more of George Harrisons' music.<br /><br />Speaking of \\"I'd Have you Anytime\\", George asks if there's anything you want to change or say. My answers are this, I don't want to change anything. And as for say, play it again George!
0307730697|5.0|Fearless arrived in my mailbox the week before Memorial Day. I was so thrilled because I had planned on having plenty of time to sit down and enjoy a book while relaxing with my family. What I didn't expect was how much the story of Navy SEAL Adam Brown's life would touch me. I rarely cry when I read a novel, but by the end of this one I felt as though I knew the Brown family personally, and that every one of his SEAL team members would have been a close family friend had I known them as well. Their heartbreak became my heartbreak.<br /><br />  Adam Brown's story is one of a prodigal son who never left home physically but would check out for days at a time as he struggled through addiction. Finding a strength and purpose greater than his own drove him not just to success in his military career, but garnered him respect and admiration among his peers. His sacrifices were many and his scars proved it. He paid the ultimate price, but even in his death his legacy lives on. This is not so much Adam's story as it is also the story of the lives of the people he touched, mentored and loved. They help tell this tale of heroism through war, success through endurance, and joy in the midst of sorrow. I won't soon forget the Brown family and Adam's team members and what they did to support and encourage Adam as he strived to be the hero that only a few men really can be. I will admit that spending this Memorial Day finishing Fearless allowed me to truly appreciate all that our men and women in military go through while we live our life unaware of what goes on behind the scenes.<br /><br />  Eric Blehm wrote a fitting tribute to a man who wanted his story shared. Adam Brown didn't consider himself a hero, he was too humbled by his past; a past that consisted of many bad choices that was eventually covered with God's love and grace. I heartily recommend this book. Adam Brown wanted everyone to know the story of redemption that he found in Christ. Thank you Brown family and SEAL Team Six members for sharing him with us.<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book through WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for my true and honest opinion.  I wasn't required to give a positive review of the novel whatsoever.

B00715SUI6|4.0|Most sequential movies get worse as they go along - this one, however, contains a twist. Each successive movie brings you back in time so you can see how these twisted events started! Killer concept! Although the ending was as predictable as the recurring plotline it was still a thrill ride to the end. I can't imagine that this series can go back any further (since video technology wasn't very prevalent - or good - prior to the 1960s), so this is likely to be the end of this run. Still worth the price!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a fun game kinda like farmville but you can play minigames and watch short movies. make your own villige and expand the property with coins. I rate this 5 star.  you can also play with friends. try it I'm sure you'll love it. this game is rated E for everyone.

B005LLSNNE|5.0|I got hooked on this show when I found it on Netflix but they hadn't released this season yet, I couldn't wait so I bought it! Its my guilty pleasure and I am so in love with Jax and his inner struggle, badass murdering biker or loving husband and father!!! I can't wait for the new season to start!!
B00870Z05U|5.0|The Love songs are the best ever written. This movie stands on its own. Wonderful! The continuation of The Phantom of the Opera.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|It protects just fine. I like the fit and feel of the plastic part, the cover and the elastic strap. I don't like how the cover is fraying on the edges (felt coming loose?) and the flimsiness of the stand. It doesn't work well. I've had this for about three weeks.

B001U6YI92|5.0|I often wonder in life, how much of success is being in the right place at the right time?  This seems to be the case, when we are thinking of others success, but not so, when we think of our own.  I deserve this, I was a hard worker, and earned this, etc.  Well, with Clint Eastwood, it might also be this way too, thinking of this unassuming man, with the quiet demeanor and charm.<br /><br />But Mr. Eastwood is VERY DESERVING of his success.  He has been one of the hardest working actors, AND directors, of our modern times.  He is ageless, he is a sophisticate, before \\"the most interesting man in the world\\" was even alive....<br /><br />I had only seen this movie, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, perhaps 3 times in my life; and all the way through only about 1 time. It has been used in so many movies, and soundtracks over the years, I feel I've seen it many more times.  This movie seems old, but is ageless. I don't even put it in the same category as those from the 50's and before, that old timey feel. No, this feels much more modern, even though you can see the age, it has aged VERY WELL.  Like Mr. Eastwood, it has aged well.<br /><br />One other thing, I'd like to point out, is this movie is \\"the Director's cut\\" before the term may have been commonly used. It is ultra long, clocking in around 3 hours.  It does not feel that long.  It goes fast.<br /><br />The coloring and transfer of this Blu Ray is out of this world.  It is the best transfer of a film this old, I've ever seen, on any format.<br /><br />I won't give a summary of the film, I just wanted to give it 5 stars, and point out some key components of the movie.  I hope you enjoy my review, and this movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended!  Two Trigger Happy Thumbs WAY UP!!!! (Yes, I know that's a play on the regular expression.)<br /><br />MC White
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Very nice thermal paste, works flawlessly and came quickly. Can't complain at all. A great price too. Remember not to use your finger to spread it too, use a credit card or put your hand in a zipper bag and do it. Great product.
B0086700CM|3.0|It really is fun,except it glitches and stutters a lot. Sometimes when you jump it just freezes and then your player dies. I hope they will be able to fix it because it is a good game concept and it would even better if they could make those fixes! Also really adicting.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome! I waited so long for it to come out, and it didn't disappoint me. My only complaint is that it lags at crucial moments sometimes (like right before a jump), but this happens rarely. Overall, this is a great game, and its being free only adds to its appeal.

B003Y74KC0|3.0|I paid $9 last year. I like the soft grip of the silicone. I'm afraid a hard plastic case would slip out of my hands. It does appear to be stretching or loosening. The case will come off when I push the phone into a tight pocket. Time will tell whether I will have to replace it. Purchased it about 8 months ago. Love the soft pink color too!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I saw this game on my teachers Ipad, and so I thought, what if its on a kindle! But that's when I had to give the ipad to someone else

B0086700CM|5.0|this tame is very addicting! its free so why not buy it? Its a must get! I cant get enough of temple run!!!!!!!
1583334386|3.0|I started reading this book, and then stopped reading it. It's not really captivating and it wants you to pace yourself. If I don't consume an entire book hungrily, I'm less likely to consume it at all. Mostly, life gets in the way. So, however well meaning this book is, if you're easily distracted and poorly motivated, maybe a book isn't the right path.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book.  The history is really beautiful, about two people finding love, finding balance, finding confidence, finding themselfs. It's not just about loving, is also about how love makes everything makes sense. Amazing book. Totally recomended.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I picked up this book after having read a lot of crap and I was glad.<br /><br />I thought the book was great.  The beginning is a little slow, but once it got its legs I couldn't put it down.  It's an interesting story and really a simple premise to it all, but I thought well done.  I found the relationships between the characters great and always wanted more or to find out more about each one.<br /><br />I would recommend the book to anyone.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun and addicting.  My son and I battle to keep high score!!  Graphics are great and it works well on my Kindle Fire.  Love it!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game with nice graphics. i play it every day. not one of those games you play once or twice and then never again.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|While waiting for all my usual fave sci-fi and fantasy authors to produce new installments in popular series, I stumbled upon \\"Wool,\\" much to my delight.  Couldn't put it down: Compelling premise.  Sharp, real characters.  Story line that unwinds at just the right pace.  I have come away feeling as though I have lived in a silo, laboring for the survival of my friends and family.  Looking forward to the next glimpse into the underground.  Bravo!  More Wool!
1439170916|5.0|The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer by Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee is just what the title states and more.<br /><br />In fact, when I finished this book, all I could repeat was, Oh. My. Ghod!<br /><br />I realize I probably say this quite a bit (there are notable exceptions, there is one), but, in this case, I was enthralled from the first word until the last.<br /><br />Dr. Mukherjee doesn't just write a dry, scholarly historical tome about cancer; instead, he creates a living, breathing dastardly enemy of the people, weaving his tale as a detective story worthy of Indiana Jones' quest for the Lost Ark.<br /><br />While the story of cancer isn't just about doctors fighting against the disease but doctors fighting amongst themselves (is cancer a surgical problem or a problem to be treated with drugs?); the tobacco company suppressing research that their product caused lung cancer; the war between women and surgeons -- some surgeons wanted to continuing mutilating women with the Halstead procedure of radical mastectomy while women wanted the more breast sparing lumpectomy.<br /><br />And the list goes on. Cancer goes on.<br /><br />We all carry the potential of cancer in our genes. I'm sure many of us have friends or family members enveloped by cancer's evil tentacles. Cancer's evil tale even touched my immediate family with my sister-in-law recently diagnosed with breast cancer -- soon to undergo chemotherapy.<br /><br />The quest for a cure for cancer has been a long one and certainly won't be finished for decades to come. But there is hope on the horizon. I was particularly interested in Dr. Brian Druker of Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) work with Gleevec (Imatinib), heralding the beginning of targeted therapy (which targets a specific enzyme) versus the tried and true chemotherapy that attacks all dividing cells, cancer or not.<br /><br />But cancer cells are wily. Just one mutation can render even the mighty Gleevec powerless. Thankfully, there are other targeted therapies that can be offered when Gleevec is no longer effective. Despite all the gains medical science has made against cancer, it takes only the one mutated cancer cell to render a new therapy useless.<br /><br />The war goes on.<br /><br />Dr. Mukherjee wraps the narrative with his experience as an oncologist around one patient. Periodically, this patient would pop up during her various stages of cancer treatment. I was worried that the author wouldn't be able to pull it all together in the end, but, much to my delight, he did.<br /><br />This is a book well-worth reading for the medical historian like myself, but also very approachable for the layperson, although, the book can be technical.<br /><br />I read the book on my iPhone 4S using the Kindle app from Amazon. The kindle file was impeccable (not like the Treating the Brain: What the Best Doctors Know) though I did catch one small burble; it wasn't enough to detract from my overall enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />I rate this book a solid 5/5 stars., there are other targeted therapies that can be offered when Gleevec is no longer effective.

1594484805|5.0|Reading Daniel Pink's DRiVE took me a lot longer than a 200 page book normally would. I couldn't stop taking notes while I read it! Normally I'd write in the margins and highlight the good parts, but I borrowed this book from the office library and that's probably frowned upon. After the fact, I'm really glad I took notes. I learn a lot through writing and reflection and it forced me to dig a little deeper and process the points I would have otherwise only highlighted.<br /><br />The book is subtitled \\"The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\\" and is in fact surprising, at least at first. His premise is that business (and I'd argue education) management and leadership haven't caught up with what science already knows: extrinsic motivation is really not all that successful for establishing behavior and pattern changes in the long run. What is motivating? Intrinsic motivation: autonomy, opportunity to pursue mastery, and daily duties that relate to a larger purpose.<br /><br />I appreciate the amount of research and resources in this book, but more than that- the subtlety Pink uses to blend them into his own words. It never feels like you're reading an essay or getting lectured, but you walk away from this book smarter. In some aspects, this book is a fantastic read for managers: create an environment that gives employees autonomy in their tasks, time, technique, and their team.<br /><br />\\"Management isn't about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices. It's about creating conditions for people to do their best work.\\"<br /><br />This can be difficult to grasp, whether we're supervising professional staff or student staff in student affairs (or any environment), but keep reading. This approach requires good hiring, trust, and some training- but the research shows that it yields much higher results and satisfaction. You literally cannot buy this kind of job performance and satisfaction through external motivators, Pink argues. External motivators work for left-brain routine tasks- things that are so uninteresting to you that a reward makes drudging through it worth it. But for work that requires critical thinking or creativity? Rewards and bribes actually hinder performance. Apparently science has known this for 40 years and the rest of us are just discovering it.<br /><br />Confused? He provides a simple When to Use Rewards flow-chart.<br /><br />This piece has huge implications for my own work in with college students. How easy is it to attach a free cookie, iPod, tshirt, gift card to something -- in the hopes that it will motivate college students? There is a time and a place for free pizza, I won't argue that. But if that's what we're using to increase retention, engagement, and affinity between college students and their university, we're wasting out time and our budgets. We need to be creating opportunities for students to develop autonomy, mastery, and purpose.<br /><br />\\"We're designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren't when we're clamoring for validation from others, but when we're listening to our own voice- doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves.\\"<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I've had more questions from strangers about this book at the gym and Starbucks than anything I've read recently- and it has real application to the work we're doing.

B005IKZSYA|3.0|When Cardinal Melville unexpectedly finds himself elected Pope, he panics, literally running away screaming from the papal balcony and his first benediction of the faithful. This situation might have set up a comic restoration of the pope to his nerve, or a satirical look at church politics. It does neither. Though sumptuously filmed and well-acted, the film finds itself wandering among various plot threads, none of which is thoroughly explored or exploited. Why did the pope run away? There are hints of hysterical memory loss, the unresolved matter of a sister turned actress, and perhaps a sense of his inner unworthiness. But nothing comes of these hints.  The psychoanalyst brought in to treat the pontiff is secular, but little is made of his role, other than a long scene in which he organizes the cardinals (locked in the Vatican until the pope recovers) in a round robin volleyball tournament. The film's sudden and baffling ending left many viewers unsatisfied.<br /><br />If there is any action in the movie at all, it is at a subtle and symbolic level. The shrink (played by director Nanni Moretti) is a member of a Freudian priesthood that runs counter to that of the church. Psychoanalysis has at least as many certain and unassailable \\"answers\\" as the church, and there might be some point in setting these institutions against each other. The volleyball game has a touch of church geopolitics about it. The cardinals are teamed by continent, each wearing colored markers similar to priestly chasubles. The analyst's organizing the teams then becomes a stand-in for the way the Vatican organizes the church's worldwide leadership. But if there was a point to be made, it was lost on me. The pope's dalliance with an acting troupe showed him as a sentimental thespian manqu&eacute;. But otherwise, his association with the troupe was wasted.<br /><br />\\"We Have A Pope\\" is teeming with such unfulfilled promises. Michel Piccoli is frail, human and bewildered in the role of the pope. But his character does little more than wander aimlessly, meandering through the streets of Rome with no purpose, no goal and no final destination. Like this film. A sad waste of talent.his character does little more than wander aimlessly, meandering through the streets of Rome with no purpose, no goal and no final destination. Like this film.

B0073PZIYI|2.0|This movie wad very WEIRD and HARD TO UNDERSTAND! I didn't get what was going on throughout the movie? If I were you I would not spend my money on this movie!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|So I read Matched because it is required reading for my son this summer.  I ordered it and read it first (always do this for his book reports to make sure he is understanding it and can do a good report).<br />I flew through it.  I saw a review that it was not 'Hunger Games' good.  Well, I loved the Hunger Games movie but could not get into the book.  So everyones opinion is just that...their opinion!<br />Once I finished Matched in 2 days, I had to get this right away.  My only disappointment is the way I feel really ripped off when a Kindle version costs as much as a print version.  But...I really wanted to read it.<br />I am loving it, I am 70% done in one day.  I am so grateful for the cloud reader so I can take a peek at work even when I am less busy!  I think it is great, I am so glad I ignored some of the more negative reviews of it being boring or not liking that its from 2 POV's.  I am just loving it.<br />Now, my only disappointment is that I have to wait 5 months for the conclusion!<br />If you liked Matched I think you will really like this book.  Just please publishers, keep in mind you are not paying for hardbound or softcover books, shipping, retailers' fees for them to keep inventory, etc.  Its an e-version, so please price it accordingly.  If my son didnt have to read Matched, I would not have paid so much.  I get free Kindle books mostly or try to limit myself to no more than $4.99 so...you would not have had a sale if it was not required by our local regional voc!<br />ENJOY!
B005HSL626|4.0|I enjoy playing Fruit Ninja! It is a game where you have to use strategy,skill, and of course ur brain! Fruit Ninja keeps me interested in many ways! It provides a good supply of different knives so you can cut the fruit in different.textures and more easily! It also provides different types of ways you can play! For example their is an arcade mode, the normal mode, and a mode where there are no bombs! It just let's you see how many fruits you can cut in a certain amount of time. However, you still get out if you miss three fruits. Although, I would defenintley purchase this game! It will keep you entertained an amused.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is great!  If anyone is bored on their phones, then this would be a perfect game for you! I went crazy when this game came out! I love it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this app is a very good app. its cool to build all the buildings and use the trucks. the only thing I don't like is that when you start the app it shows little ads and other apps and you have to touch the start button for the game. over all it is very fun and kills time
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is awesome!! everyone who owns this on their app store should get it. it is addictive! so listen to me and get it!!
B003Z2LAAO|4.0|This 3D movie puts you right there with this group. It has a lot of history not only about the river but the natives that lived there. It has great scenery that made me feel almost like I was there. Grand Canyon is a must see.

B0073PPKNM|3.0|Melody Gardot's previous album \\"My One And Only Thrill\\" is Breathtaking! I listen to it all the time. If you want one song choice from it, try \\"Somewhere Beyond The Rainbow\\" for a different and captivating performance.<br /><br />I was therefore very excited to receive the new release by her. When I first listened to track 3 (High Quality equipment) I thought my CD player was broken and not tracking correctly. Lots of ticks and pops that did not go with the beat of the music. Very confusing to listen to. THEN track 11 came on and the music just stopped for about 10 minutes of an 18 minute track!!! ALSO, the overall sound is somewhat muted and not that relaxing to listen to. I feel always on edge.  I honestly feel that the problem here is with the recording process.  SO MUCH OF A DISAPPOINTMENT FROM HER PREVIOUS ALBUMS.  THANK YOU FOR THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT POINTED OUT THE PROBLEMS. Unfortunate that the recording process interfered with the artist performance. Melody Gardot is a great talent.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so glad they had this app lots of friends had it but I couldn't find one 4 my kindle :( then the other day I saw it the only downside is now I'm addicted :)

If you get bored with doing the same workout then switch it up.  You can skip around the different levels so you don't get bored and still get an awesome workout!

0061726834|4.0|Admittedly, I was not all that excited about this book upon its release.  The blurb did nothing for me. I thought a cure for love sounded silly. It did not interest me in the least. However, I have had a bit of an obsession lately with all things dystopia and Delirium kept popping up. Over and over and over and over again.  Then I won a bunch of books in a Giveaway from Whitney Reads over at Burnt Pages and Pandemonium was in that bunch.  So, I took it as a sign that I needed to pick up Delirium.<br /><br />So glad I did.<br /><br />The 'deliria' isn't as cheesy as I thought it would be.  Oliver was clever with the world she created and the need for the cure.  The panic that exists in the midst of any love or happiness was written masterfully.  I believed every bit of it.  What she created in Lena, the protagonist, was easy to relate to given her past and surroundings.  The cure becomes a life line from the pain of abandonment and loneliness.  The one sure thing in her life and she's so excited she counts the days.  Until by happenstance she meets Alex and falls in love.<br /><br />With Alex she learns things she never dreamed of, the world she knows is turned upside down and shaken out.  And now that she has found love can she still go through with the cure? Will she even be given the choice?<br /><br />The world sucked me in right away. There isn't a religious presence but their 'bible', for lack of a better word, is called the Book of Shhh and is full of biblical quotes and references. I found this all a bit brilliant.  Romeo and Juliet is taught as a cautionary tale to children, again brilliant.  Delirium is filled with these little things and I enjoyed every one of them.<br /><br />I will say again that Oliver was quite skillful in the way she created the question of 'to cure or not to cure'.  At times you fully believe people would choose this horrible thing; to become numb from pain and misery.  And then comes the end of the book...<br /><br />Oh. Holy. Cow. DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />Okay, I know this review is a tad frantic and weird but right now... I don't care.  I am off to go read Pandemonium because I NEED to know what happens next!!DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />Okay, I know this review is a tad frantic and weird but right now... I don't care.  I am off to go read Pandemonium because I NEED to know what happens next!!
B0086700CM|5.0|entertaining chalange addictive and advantageous is how I would discribe temple run. this game could make five hours seem like five minutes!

B003IKMR0U|5.0|I hadn't really been into table top gaming the last 20 30yrs.  Outside of popular board games like monopoly, trivial pursuit, parcheezi, trouble, candy land, etc etc.  But on the youtube channel for geek and sundry they have a show called tabletop. It's hosted by wil wheaton[who is a gamer for a long time.] and they play a different game each show. Now most of these games in the shops and online run right around $40, Settlers of Canaan, Tsurbo, Ticket to Ride etc.  At the moment it's out of my price range to dump that much or more on a board game..no matter how long it'll keep me and others entertained.  So this seemed perfect after catching that episode of table top, which also included the games Tsurbo and...bite me..I think;  and looking it up here.  So I ordered it, it arrived and I started playing with my younger sister. My little sister absolutely LOVES this game.  We'll play anywhere from 35mins to an hour and a half non stop at the dining room table. It's amusing, entertaining and fun.  Actually as I sit her typing this the weather is sounding like it's going to turn decidedly nasty so I may turn off after I post and go play some more. I enjoy it soo much that I've ordered the 3 die expansion pack Zombie Dice 2:Double Feature, which adds something new to the game in the way it's played.  I also intend to pick up another game by the same company Steve Jackson Game, called Cthulu Dice, Hopefully in the near future.  This thing is a short, fast, push your luck dice game that's a blast to play.  I'm immensely pleased.  My only complaint is the container. It makes quite a bit of noise when you shake up the dice in it. Which is really only a worry when we play late at night sometimes...which we do. I'm going to pick up a piece of felt cloth, pry the bottom out, glue the felt onto the bottom, put a couple beads of glue on it,  then shove the bottom back into the cylinder...should quiet it down a bit. Outside of that REALLY minor nitpick....no complaints whatsoever.Hence the five star review
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Got sucked into this prematurely as I was reading the Reacher series in order and had just finished Reacher 7 and found an excerpt for this following the book.  I of course thought this was the name of Reacher 8.This turns out to be Reacher 16, but since it takes place while he was still in the Army, it was okay.  Bad for Amazon to place this sample out of order though.<br />Turns out to be a great read, but has a lot more sex in it than I am used to in Reacher novels.  Not really necessary in my opinion. Reacher pulls off some unbelievable exploits and we are led to believe he gets away with it.  Also, I am not so sure I like that he disrespects the Rangers in the way he one handedly handles three of them.  After all, we're talking about some of America's finest here.  Reacher is only a MP!<br /> But what the heck, I'll still go back to pick back up at Reacher 8, as I've not been able to find any author as creative as Childs anywhere else.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am sooooooo glad that this finally came out for my kindle!hay! I am so exited that I can play it now!
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game!! one flaw though, the game on my kindle fire is really sensitive and it tilts easily.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|For those of you who are wondering... this trilogy started as a twilight fanfiction. At its core you still recognize the Edward and bella characterization. Being adapted from a Fanfiction story, fifty shades has its flaws. I have read some reviews critizing EL James for writing like a 16 year old girl,  which is simply untrue. The twilight saga was based on an idealistic perspective of a 17 year old and some of the naive motives appear in this novel. However, this novel is well written and truly intriguing. As someone who read the original fanfiction... EL takes her new characters to higher, darker levels as she tries to shed the twilight persona. I want to congratulate the author for doing what most fanfiction writers dream of... she published her work.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. It is rare when a sequel is better than the first one, but I enjoyed this book more. The author really pulls you into the action, emotions and surprises in this book.  In the first book, I was bothered by the whole concept of the story and it took me a little time to adjust. By the second book, I was totally engrossed and enjoyed the ride.It is a really good read. I highly recommend it.

B007R4ZNWW|4.0|Holy smokers, this movie's plot will blow your mind and leave you feeling plenty uncomfortable. By now, most moviegoers know director Pedro Almodovar is out there. The Skin I Live In takes it waaaaaaay out there. It also goes to show if you give Antonio Banderas a meaty role in his own language that he has a far greater acting range than he seems to have in English-speaking roles.<br /><br />Needless to say this is a clever yet creepily inventive movie that not only flips the psycho-sexual thriller on its edge but walks it around the block a few times and spits it out in a horrifying mix of sexual perversity, very dubious medical ethical choices and a weirdness you're not likely to see anywhere else.<br /><br />Extras on the DVD are a waste. The \\"Making Of\\" is a just 12 minutes of raw footage where you see cameras and boom mics in scenes. The \\"Red Carpet NYC Premiere\\" is better as you hear from the actors and director but it is extremely short.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game because I have it on my ipod but I like it on my kindle it Isa Niger screen

0451232577|1.0|I am big Ken Follet fan, My favourite book of his is On Wings of Eagles and of course, Pillars of the Earth. This book started off well, in the first chapter. I was intrigued and carried on reading only to be sorely dissapointed. All of his character are incredibly flat and boring. Without believable characters, as interesting a backdrop WW1 is, the story becomes flat and predictable. There was far too much stereotyping and sex scenes...  Don't buy this book.  Mr Follet, please, you can do better.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so glad that they brought it out its the best game I've gotten so far! I hope everyone gets this game :D
B0086700CM|5.0|After waiting for Temple Run to be released for Kindle Fire, I was skeptical after reading reviews that stated it ran sluggishly on the Fire...but I decided to download anyway.  To my pleasure, I have had no problems at all with it.  It has a seamless interface,  controls are smooth and responsive.  The gameplay is, indeed, addicting...&quot;just one more run...&quot;.  You can't ask for a better price...but it would have been worth it even as a paid app.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is AMAZING!!! don't hesitate to get it. this is absolutely the best game you can get for free. on the kindle fire, I haven't found any problems with it.
B002VECM4A|1.0|After having read the book Push by Sapphire, and then watching this movie (which was supposed to be based upon the book) I wondered  \\"IF\\" they had actually read the book!!<br /><br />I cannot see where all the acclaim for this movie was based. It was as if the movie and book were not really even related.<br /><br />All whoop and no substance.
B0085776BG|3.0|I am a big fan of war movies.  I love aviation movies.  I listened to George Lucas discuss the making of this film with amazing passion on NPR.  I was very excited to watch a movie of LUCAS (epic) proportions based on the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African American USAAF servicemen during World War II.<br /><br />The scenery and air scenes were awesome.  There were some touching moments.<br /><br />The bad:<br />It felt like the writers wished they were allowed to use a narrator and instead had random people say awkward lines just to slam the viewer in the face with perfectly obvious statements.  This made the film lose its magic.<br /><br />Great stories show you their heart, this story had the potential.  Instead the movie told you its message, again and again, and often using deadpan dubbed sounding voices.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Excellent puzzle game.  This is my new favorite game! It is late so here are the rest of the words to make twenty.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can't beloved that I have temple run on my kindle fire! This game rocks and is strangely addicting. I love it that they finally released it.
B003XDZLTG|5.0|I have terrible feet, plantar fascitis flare ups, bunions, wide and flat feet.  i dislike the classic clog, they are so unattractive, and refuse to wear those anywhere but in the yard. but when I tried the shayna crocs and walked in it a day it was great.....UNTIL.... a red spot developed in my instep due to the strap fastener irritating the inside of my feet... my heart sank and thought what will i do with the 6 pairs coming my way.. to all of you who have had the same issue as mine, i found an excellent solution... i cut a long rectangle of super moleskin plus (you can use dr. scholl brand or your favorite drug store equivalent.... but instead of sticking it to the inside of your feet, cover the circle that fastens the top strap to the inside....and viola!!!!! no more redness no more potential blister because the irritating disc is covered with soft cushy moleskin plus....my cute and comfy shoes are back and I love them.  incidentally, i am a size 7.5 to an 8.  i purchased an 8 and they are perfect!!! couldn't be happier, until another color shows up. i now own 7 pairs of these and love them. i found these initially at a croc outlet where they had a buy two get one free. but very limited selection..blue, petal pink, and brown.<br /><br />update:<br />of my many shayna pairs (7) only one rubbed my instep. it must have shrunk due to heat. so i tried the heat and remold method and it works. i no longer need the moleskin stickie on the strap fastener.  they are comfortable for my fussy feet... i have heel spurs that flare up, bunions, flat feet and these shoes look cute and are very comfy. i wear them in the house too. i should have tried crocs sooner! i ordered the marnie and malindi looking forward to reviewing those.
B001DSNELA|5.0|This was the best Bond movie, but you have to see it more than once to catch everything in it. The two extra discs in the collectors edition added some interesting information one wouldn't have known otherwise. Well worth the money.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an awesome game! I love it everyone should get this. it never gets boring! little irritating at first but push through cause once u get the hang of it it is so cool!
B0086700CM|5.0|you should get this game its very good. once you get used to it its a good game. so if you want an addicting game get it.  what i like about it is it is never ending. you will problably like that too.
B003Y38YFS|5.0|Seriously, it is time for me to shut down my computer and go sit in a corner.  I keep buying Crocs!  I have bought four pair in the last month and if they keep making such cute styles, I am going to need an intervention.  I just got these today.  I ordered the Grapefruit and I love the color, though my man said, \\"Grapefruit?  Looks more like cantaloupe.\\"  Whatever, the color is gorgeous.  The thong does not cause any pain at all between the toes, but I admit I have had them on only for about a half-hour.  Still, I took a stroll up and down my block in them and they feel great.  I love the fun style.  I am between an 8 and 8.5 M, and I got the 8. The footbed is exactly the right length and the sandal stays very secure on my foot.  I always order the 8 in Crocs and they always fit perfectly.  I think between these and my Oyster Sexi Platform sandals, I will be living in sandals all summer long.  But then, I also have to wear my Adrina Flats and my Adrina II flats.  I love them all.  Once you have spent an entire day walking in Crocs, it really is hard to wear other shoes.  I wore a pair of leather wedges (my favorite sandals last summer) for an event the other day and I could not wait to get home so I could take them off.  Crocs' comfort really has spoiled me for other shoes.  I really recommend these.
0553801473|3.0|To give this book one star as so many have done is just absurd. That one star rating is obviously not an objective rating of the book but rather an emotional reaction. No, ADWD is not as good as the first three books. No, there is not a lot of meaningful action. Yes, the cliffhanger endings are ill-employed. But ADWD is still a decent read. It lacked real action, but it wasn't boring. It has all of the interesting characters. Definitely a pick up from AFFC, which covered the less interesting characters.
B002VEB228|5.0|Loved this movie!  The last part of the movie was awesome.  It really made you think.  Nicko was hot too! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is a good app but a lot of the stuff that is a lot of money is worthless junk.
B005DBI8XC|1.0|within 5 mins of using it makes my wrist sore<br /><br />Yes setting it up was cool. Yes it has ALOT of potential. I do not know how to explain it; but this item causes me to have sore wrists anytime I even try to use it now.<br /><br />I have the g15 and even playing 16 hours straight i do not get sore wrists. 2 minutes with this beast... and there I am; gimped.
0143119680|5.0|I simply loved this book.  I found the story and storytelling compelling, and I'm anxiously waiting for the sequel to come out in a few months.  Deborah Harkness did a masterful job of creating this storyline and characters.  I haven't fallen in love with a book like I did with this one for longer than I can remember.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I have been really enjoying this app. Its very entertaining to see other amateur \\"artist\\" like myself draw crazy pictures and try to guess what the heck it is.
B002SW8Y2E|3.0|The book had come highly recommended, but I found the quality of writing only so-so.  Had the subject matter not been so interesting, perhaps readers' ratings would have been different.  Nonetheless, I found it a compelling story and a worthwhile read.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|Let me preface this by saying... I am a Baldacci fan. I've read everything he's written.  This novel was not up to par. I kept waiting for the ending to wrap up the many plot experiments he presented in this book.  It turns left, right, straight, and backward. It is so difficult to follow that the reader can't possibly believe the conclusion, nor buy the link between the two main characters that he tried to establish. Sorry... a long way from his usual effort.
B0086700CM|5.0|wow I love this game I am always so happy whenever I get a high score. you should try to.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I'm just getting used to this concept, different from traditional solitaire, and I'm enjoying that difference.  Not mindless in the least!  Hard to stop playing.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so very awesome and addicting I cannot put it down.  the only thing I want is some explanation of the different Color coins.
B000FC1192|5.0|I wish I could have read this book as a child.  Neil Gaimans work is creepy and fun.  I love that it is accessible to both adults and children alike.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is incredibly addicting, and I just can't stop playing! I don't ever want to stop!! everyone should play!!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Braveheart is my favorite movie of all time, I must have watched it a thousand times and still I do not get bored of it.
B0086700CM|5.0|When I was playing a few days ago, I realized the reason the protagonist's being hunted J's because he stole something sacrsd. You're getting what's coming to you. It is an awesome game, challenging and you really don't need to waste real money if you don't want to, it gets addictive.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Love these types of games. This one is very enjoyable. Graphics are nice. Will purchase this one..I would reccomend this game to lover's of hidden objects..
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I truly expected more from this blockbuster best seller. I slogged through this book, patiently awaiting the realization of why this book and this trilogy has done so well. By the end, I realized it was popular purely because of the yuck factor, as the writing is uninspiring and the plot weak, sluggish, and not believable.
159562015X|1.0|Complete waste of my time. I would give zero stars if I could. So far as I can tell this is drivel for the dull and ignorant. The reader is prompted to take a multiple choice test that asks simplistic, limiting questions then proceeds to \\"tell one about himself\\" in old-fashioned fortune teller style. If you are the kind of person who enjoys reading your horoscope weekly, this book is for you. If you have half a brain, are insightful and have come to understand your strengths through life, you will not need this piece of junk. Be skeptical of anyone who believes this \\"bestseller\\" is worthwhile. Unfortunately, my boss was the person who recommended this to me...
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Bought this item on a whim and just received it today and I LOVE it! The boys are adorable, the music is infectious (as long as you love boy band music) and the bonus 3 music video's are worth the DVD. The hype is there for a reason, these lads really do deliver and they do all that they can to make their fans happy.<br /><br />I look forward to their next DVD and their follow up CD to Up All Night.
B0086700CM|5.0|im so happy it finally came out on kindle fire. I have been waiting for this it is a really fun game
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I was always trying to get it on 4 shared but they did not have it on the app store so when I found out temple run came out on the kindle fire I was so excited because I have it on my ipod and it is really fun and cool so now it is even better on the kindle fire!!!!!!!!!!!  :) :D

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a great little cover that fits over the kindle. It is thin but protective and weighs very little. I wanted this cover so when I took my Kindle Fire on vacation it was protected though not bulky or heavy to carry in my purse or carryon as I had many other electronic things that I had to carry with me as well(camera,cell phone,GPS,etc) and these items cannot be in the checked luggage. Worked out great!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome! !!:)<br />The best calculator app out there. Its big and  nicely designed. Ive tried many other app but nothing compares to this one.

B004SOR4H6|1.0|Used to look and work fine when it was a small square app on my home screen, then it started to not load tweets, so i uninstalled it and installed it again, now it sucks. My timeline doesnt show the tweets of the people i follow and it takes up too much space on the home screen
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome I love it it is really cool to play it id soooooooooooooo fun u should buy it and it is free
B0086700CM|5.0|man the only person I play with is karma lee. she got the fastest legs in the whole west but its bigger because I'm playing on my kindle. this game is the truth. its is harder to hey to a million because the screen is bigger.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game deserves more than 5 stars! I do not want to stop playing! it is so addicting! I tell myself just one more game but I keep hitting the run button!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I HAD SEEN THE MOVIE, MY SISTER'S KEEPER, AND THOUGHT I WOULD READ THE BOOK ALSO.  IT WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MOVIE, BUT STILL A VERY GOOD STORY AND ONE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.  I ALSO READ 19 MINUTES BY JODI PICOULT AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO READ.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to come out forever on the Kindle Fire!  So amazing!  People say that it is glichy on the Kindle, and it was really glichy on my Galaxy S Samsung Mesmerise, but I have had no problems with it on my Kindle.  Amazingly AWESOME and highly addicting game that will keep you entertained for hour (I know it did for me!) :) :) :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like the clarity of the screen as you play and the speed of the finger motions are fast
B007FZVWFA|4.0|I liked it. I thought the plot was believable and original. The acting was fine, but the characters needed more development, more depth. All in all, a good viewing though.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is amazing I love it I play it every day and cant stop playing it is so addictive
B007ZKY7XO|2.0|I must admit my first listen through \\"Magic Hour\\" was underwhelming. I will admit I am new to the cult of the Sisters but was blown away by them on the Gaga tour, so I ran out and bought everything. My fave album is \\"Night Work\\" which hooked me immediately from beginning to end. Energetically, MH did not hook me at all. I also liked Ta-Dah a lot.<br /><br />I am listening to it on repeat and I'm getting into it more, but its taking work. I like the lyrics but the tunes aren't as catchy to me. Nothing stands out with much urgency. I think it's not even terribly danceable. I am giving it the college try because I love them so, but it makes me just want to put Night Work on.<br /><br />I'm excited to catch the tour and see if they ignite a love for any of the new material after I see it live.<br /><br />I will say the \\"Deluxe\\" version is a mad letdown-bonus tracks that leave much to be desired and one of which is a throwaway of Ana leaving a VM message. Kinda lame. The promised video and behind the scenes are nowhere to be found in the package. They are on a website for anyone but advertised as being exclusive to the \\"Deluxe\\" edition. Kinda cheap and scammy if you ask me. So essentially I paid extra for a web address on the back of the CD case. Fail.<br /><br />The Gossip released the album of the summer if you asked me. Hot tracks, wicked beats and ONE version that is reasonably priced. Pick that up first if your music budget only allows one CD.
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been playing on my ipod and friends i phones but its finally on myfire! runs smoother and looks better. thanks a billion Imangi!
B001993Y3G|5.0|So, yeah, the movie is good.  Kevin Costner nails the spirit of the Robin Hood character, if not the accent (but enough has been said about that already). Alan Rickman and Morgan Freeman make the movie, of course. Every generation seems to have its own preferred version of Robin Hood, from Errol Flynn in the '30s and '40s, to the TV version of the '50s and '60s, even to the Disney animated version of the '70s (and I'm sure the next generation will probably hold some regard for the Russell Crowe version); as someone who was around 8 or 9 when \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\" debuted theatrically, this is my personal favorite.  Everything--from the sumptuous set design and costumes, to the unique character actors, to the refreshingly earthy romance between Robin and Marian, to the slightly darker take on the legend--just plain works.<br /><br />Picture quality on the Blu Ray is about average for a twenty-year-old catalog release; not bad, but not exactly the best Blu has to offer, either. The film could definitely use a new HD master, but public demand is most likely not large enough to justify the costs in Warner Bros.' view, so this'll have to do.  Sound quality is excellent: the film's soundtrack was recorded using a Dolby process which was experimental at the time. It was rendered on the previous two-disc special edition as DTS, and appears here on Blu Ray as a Dolby TrueHD track.  Special features are adequate, but are definitely showing their age at this point: two documentaries are presented, one of which is hosted by a pre-Bond Pierce Brosnan decked out in some very '90s attire.<br /><br />And now comes the vitriol:<br /><br />1) I really wish they would include the superior theatrical version in whatever ends up being the next release. The extended version of this film completely throws the pacing off and ultimately robs its most interesting character, Nottingham, of some of his compelling, unexplained weirdness. Normally, I'd be of the opinion that \\"more AlanRickman = better\\" in a film; however, revealing the Sheriff's backstory doesn't add much to the character or the film overall.  Unfortunately, consumers who prefer the theatrical cut only have the option of purchasing the original non-anamorphic two-sided DVD, one of the earliest (and worst) releases from Warner Bros. on DVD.  Which brings me to:<br /><br />2) I've noticed this issue for years but haven't addressed it until now.  Saying this will probably bring unhelpful votes my way, but I can't figure out what is wrong with some of these reviewers here.  Is it head trauma?  Some kind of cognitive disorder?  I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here, because it can't be that they're too stupid to navigate a 15-year-old technology.  (And I'm not leaving aside any senior citizens on this, either; if you can figure out how to post a review on the internet, you can figure out how to flip a damn DVD.)  These folks have dragged the rating of a good film down because they've been outsmarted by a piece of plastic which, by the way, clearly states that the \\"additional content\\"--i.e., the second half of the movie--is on the reverse side of the disc. I know this because A) I own this version of the movie, B) I can read, and C) I'm not a moron.  This phenomenon has also affected the ratings of otherwise films that were originally released on \\"flippers\\", like Goodfellas or Sleepers, for example.  Now obviously, Amazon bears some responsibility on this issue because much of their movie ratings are aggregated from several different releases of the same film.  But what's REALLY hilarious is that flippers have been around since the very earliest days of DVD, and 15 years later I'm still seeing reviews basically saying, \\"derp, I am outraged, this only has half the movie on it, whatever shall I do, derp derp !!\\"  Please stop.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so happy they added this game for the kindle fire. Ever since I got it I play it all he time
0345803485|5.0|This series has been the best I've ever read.  I have fallen in love with the characters and I love the way it's written.  It's so much more than I expected, especially after reading the reviews.  I haven't been able to put it down.  I hope she writes more about Christian and Ana.  I don't want it to be over!  I will definitely be retreading this whole series!
B0051T47NQ|4.0|--------------------------------------<br />Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.<br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />I watched this with my dad just last month.  I was apprehensive to say the least about sitting through this.  But from the way my dad kept raving about this movie over and over again, I had to at least give it 30 minutes.  Well, when it came back on 'The Movie Channel' I gave it the 30 minutes, and then some.<br /><br />It takes a lot for a film to grab me, I have an extremely low attention span, but this film achieved the grab.  This is a miracle really, since I generally don't like subtitled films, nor do I like movies shot in the shaky 'Blair Witch' format.<br /><br />But for some reason I didn't mind watching this movie.  Once you see the trolls stomping out of their caves and forests and this lone \\"warrior\\" going up against them you can't look away.<br /><br />***Movie/Plot Details, Some Spoilers ahead***<br /><br />The plot is rather simplistic.  Norway is and has been since forever, infested with trolls.  Little trolls, big trolls, all kinds.  Like deer and bears, they must be kept in check.  Thus enter the troll-hunter, the sole hunter of these monsters in the entire country of Norway.  His job is simple, comb the country side and when trolls are coming into populated areas and eating people, kill them.  It's not as hard as it sounds... trolls are extremely sensitive to sunlight, and dumb.  A blast from his UV ray gun is usually all that's needed to turn them to stone or make them explode.<br /><br />Thus he sets traps for them, bating the said traps with gravel and charcoal, trolls love to eat rocks, like I said they're dumb.<br /><br />Enter a foreign camera crew filming a documentary.  For some odd reason, and against every rule Norway has, the troll-hunter wants them to follow him on his hunting.  After witnessing the trolls and probably messing their pants, the camera crew decides to follow this mysterious hunter and film him.<br /><br />Well that's just for starters, things escalate for everyone and you the viewer are taken along for the ride.<br /><br />---In Conclusion---<br /><br />Is this the greatest movie ever made?  Absolutely not.  But for the format and the budget this is a rather enjoyable experience.  It's good sometimes to watch films that don't have 400 hundred million dollar budgets.  This is one of those times.<br /><br />Well, I hope this review is helpful, and remember trolls are only in Norway.  America has \\"Bigfoot\\" to contend with...against every rule Norway has, the troll-hunter wants them to follow him on his hunting.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Perfect! So many devotionals and plans to choose from. This is a wonderful resource you're providing and many may come to know God because of it. Thank you!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read anything erotic before but with all the talk about this book I thought I'd give it a try. It was very good and I really enjoyed it! I am a twenty year old myself and going through college. Not everyone sleeps around and doesn't remember their younger years. The fact that Ana is still a virgin could be a real thing. Although ITS A BOOK. The book was fiction an not meant to be real life. People go crazy for twilight and obviously that's never going to happen. I thought the book was great and I think that everyone needs to get off their high horse and see that the author is very talented and she did a great job of putting this book together. Obviously, it's a best seller. And what's wrong with someone writing a book about the perfect guy and a not so perfect girl? It can happen...So for the old people who keep writing comments about this book being bad...Your just jealous of the happenings in this book. Just get over it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I should have read the reviews of this book instead of taking the word of my co-workers.  I am sooooo dissapointed. I am reading book one and on chapter thirteen and I don't think I can get through it. It just  doesn't grab me.  I  will  give a book a chance and read five or six chapters, if it doesn't hold my interest, I put it down. Why  I kept reading  this one, I will never know.  I  wasted my money . I am sure I will not finish reading this book. If you like  to read erotica, I highly recommend  the  trilogy  by  Anne Rice, \\" The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty \\". From page one, she  has the reader hooked. I read the three within four days. From now on, I am going to listen to the reviews.
B0086700CM|5.0|...if you get this game you will spend the rest of your life playing it.I LOVE THIS GAME!!!ITS SOOOO ADDICTING!!!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Ive been searching for a good picross game for a while and this is the best i've found. Plenty of puzzles, good blend of difficulty. Interface is relatively smooth - there are inherent difficulties with the smaller screen size, but nothing deal-breaking.
B003XDZN8A|2.0|I bought these shoes to wear while camping because I'm not a fan of flip flops or most sandals. At first I loved the shoes because they were very comfortable while walking on a flat surface. I tried them on at home and wore them around the house for a couple days. When it came time to go camping, I noticed immediately while walking around in more of a bumpy terrain (i.e. anywhere outdoors) the shoe was rubbing on the arch of my foot. At first I thought maybe I was just getting used to the shoe or something, but within a few hours I had 2-inch-long blisters on the same area where the shoe was rubbing. I normally wear an 8 1/2, so I ordered a size 9, which was very comfortable (roomy, but not too roomy). I know the size I ordered was not an issue, and more of an issue with the shoe material.<br /><br />I stopped wearing the shoe because of the blisters, thinking maybe I just need to break the shoes in and I'll wait a few days to wear them again. Unfortunately, while camping in a tent, I left my shoes outside and didn't think to put them in my tent during the day. The sun shrunk my crocs at least one size. I put them on my feet the next day and it was a struggle and they ended up being too tight.<br /><br />The shoes are a cuter version of the crocs clogs, which I also own. The shape of these just didn't work for me because of the blisters they caused. I have never noticed my other crocs shrinking in the sun, so these might be a bit thinner than the clogs.<br /><br />Basically I had this shoe for two days and it blistered my foot horribly and the next day shrunk in the sun. These were a waste of money for me. If you're not planning on only wearing these shoes inside, I just can't recommend them.
B0086700CM|5.0|a great. game<br /><br />I love this game it is super fun I play it every day I can't get out of it is so fun
B005DESVPO|4.0|When I hear a song I like on the radio, I write it down so I can play samples on Amazon to see if I'd like to buy it.  When I wrote down Clark's Bright Lights, I noted, \\"Just buy it.\\"  Which I did.  Lead guitar oriented rock.  Soaring guitar.  My stuff (I'm an old Zep, Zapp, Jimi, Clap fan).  Not 5 star because one acoustic piece was a little weak.  I'm glad I bought this.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is my all time favorite game! I had it on my iPod but that broke and when it came to amazon I was so happy! I love the game and I'm so addicted!!!!!!!
B004LWZWBU|4.0|This movie really surprised me. My wife is a birder, currently working on a backyard Big Year, and so was eager to see it. I can't tell a Pacific from a Winter Wren and have never been a particular fan of Steve Martin's \\"wild and crazy guy\\" shtick, so I fully expected to dislike it. I was wrong. This is a very nicely done film about family, friends and priorities. That could be boring, but not here. It doesn't hurt that it was filmed in some stunning locations. A few of the bird models were a bit unbelievable, but the rest of the cast was very convincing. This movie deserved a much better box office reception than it received.
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant believe temple run is out on the kindle I play temple run all the time!!! I used to have to play temple run on my dads ipod but now I can play it on my kindle (got everything on temple run)
B0064NTZKI|5.0|I was totally mesmerized by this documentary. Fascinating stories and insights about Woody's life and his films. I was impressed by Woody's personal involvement (including visits to his childhood haunts) and by the interviews of a broad range of friends and colleagues who have known and worked with him over the years. The film clips were well chosen and convey the unique characteristics and qualities of each film. I am thankful that this documentary was made; it does justice to Woody's ongoing contributions to film.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Awesomely fun game.  It is a must play game.  especially if you love chopping up zombies.  slice and dice, dice and slice.

0385534639|5.0|I loved this book and after reading, it has really affected and stayed with me. I thought it was beautifully written and spell binding. I could not put this down and once I entered this fantastical world I didn't want to leave. I hope this author writes more soon. Such an amazing voice!
0446572993|3.0|Im a big fan of Mr Baldacci and was looking forward to this book after a couple of not so good from him. I'm afraid another not so good. Still better than most but not up to his best. All a bit meh, no real heart to the story. I will hang on in there, as the past books have been some of the best I've read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a fun game! give it a try! great way to veg out after a long day. reminds me of a game I played as a kid.
B0086700CM|5.0|the game temple run is AWESOME!! you may not think so at first. you may just think &quot;this is boring&quot;. &quot; I'm just running&quot; u may turn it off but suddenly u will come back for more!! amazing and addicting. just plain AWESOME!!!<br />Ps. this is what happened to me
B0086700CM|5.0|this game helps with my coordinate its the best game ever and its really enjoying on my count this is one of the games that a entire family will enjoy playing together
B007ZD17XO|2.0|Average to adequate are the best words to describe this game.  Can become very boring and I only play for 5 minutes at a time.
B0086700CM|5.0|Do i really have to say anything? It's Temple Run. I luv it 2 death. You will too. Get it now!
B007VGXS8M|3.0|This is a beginner to intermediate level search game that I enjoyed playing. The scenes are somewhat challenging continue to sporadically play.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Very dissapointed in the movie. Very dry. The movie lacked in many ways. Save your money. I guess it's hard to make a good movie now a days!
B00846F1YW|5.0|As with the first one, I enjoyed playing and look forward to future versions.  I like the ability to skip dialogue and enjoy the flash and graphics.  Imagery is great!

B003BM374K|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie because I have never read the book.  I actually didn't even know a book existed until I read some of the reviews, but I was delightfully surprised at how wonderful the movie was.  It had a great story with good acting.  This is definitely one that the whole family can enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg! ive been waiting for this game FOREVER!!!!!! GET THIS GAME.....YOU HAVE TO!!!!!<br />THIS GAME IS SOOOO ADDICTING I LUV IT
0061726834|4.0|What if the root of all societal problems was a disease? And even better, what if there was a surgery that could cure this disease or prevent it from happening? Would you want the surgery? Would you want your children to have it? Would you want it to be mandatory for everyone in your society, to ensure a peaceful existence free from crimes of passion or suicide?  What if there were added benefits to the cure - the ability to accept things easily and to make decisions based on logic instead of emotion?  I'm guessing the answer to these questions for many would be yes.  But what if I told you this horrible disease has a name.  It's called amor deliria nervosa, or in other words, love.<br /><br />In Lauren Oliver's book Delirium, Lena Haloway can't wait to be cured of the delirium.  The date of her surgery is scheduled for September third, her eighteenth birthday, and by the end of the summer, her best friend Hanna will be cured too. Lena and Hanna have been best friends since grade school and plan on having a great last summer together. But each of the girls have different ideas of what a \\"great summer\\" entails.  Hanna wants to really live it up before it's too late, and starts going to some forbidden parties with alcohol, uncured boys, and forbidden music.  Lena can't think of anything more undesirable and dangerous.  While trying to stop Hanna from going to one of these forbidden parties, she sees Alex.  Alex has been cured, but he seems different than other Cureds.  He loves forbidden music and poetry, and he's somehow kinder and softer than other Cureds.  Lena finds herself a victim of the deliria as she can't help falling in love with him.  But Alex has a secret, not only about himself, but about a life outside the society they live in.  Lena is left with the question of whether she will go through with her surgery, or if she can imagine a life outside the one she's always known.<br /><br />Delirium is a very well done dystopian novel.  The author expertly weavesthe description of Lena's world through many chapters, slowly revealing the secrets of Lena's past and illustrating the constant fear and conflict that lives within her.  The tone of the book creates a world of anxiety and discomfort, which is exactly how I imagined Lena would feel existing in such an oppressive society and doing things that are forbidden.  One of the most clever aspects of the novel are the references to The Book of Shhh (The Book of Safety, Health and Happiness Handbook), which is the handbook that rules Lena's society.  Many of the chapters begin with excerpts from The Book of Shhh, and really serve to illustrate how the cure evolved, and just how detrimental Lena's society thinks the deliria can be.  Just the name, The Book of Shhh, adds to the feelings of being stifled and controlled.<br /><br />I absolutely fell in love with the characters in this book.  Lena's evolution throughout the book was interesting as we watch her go from someone who is constantly scared to someone who becomes more confident and in control. Hanna is such a great contrast to Lena's character, she's bold and daring in the beginning, but it was also interesting to see how Hanna's character also evolved, almost as if Hanna and Lena seem to switch roles.  But most of all, I love the romance between Lena and Alex.  Alex is such a great character, he's easy to love - he's romantic and altruistic and makes incredible sacrifices for Lena.<br /><br />If you like dystopian fiction, you should definitely put this book on your reading list.
0803731094|5.0|Love the book. Love the movie (Oscar winner). Get this book for your kid, your kid's friends, everyone. You'll enjoy reading it too!
B007EC6FIS|5.0|this album is as good as hopes and fears and under the sea.some reviewers are possibly not giving it enough of a listen.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|on my nexus not so much. game play is addictive and fun but extremely frustrating to play on a phone. squares are tiny and you will find yourself selecting the wrong area over and over again. if the scalability was better definitely a 5 star game.
B0086700CM|5.0|its addictive and very fun once you get started. I always played this game on my friends ipod but now that it came out on the kindle I play it every day.
B004P8ITGU|5.0|The book captured me from start to finish and ended too quickly.  Fantastic read especially for John Grisham fans. Can't wait to read the next instalment.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game, and I was devastated when I found out that it was only available in the apple app store, but now that it is on kindle fire, I have barely been able to put it down! it operates smoothly and no glitches have yet been found. I would reccomend this game to anyone who is looking for a (digital) great time!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant believe it at all I think I'm in a dream right now... O M G someone pinch me please
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an awesome app. I am so addicted to it and could probably play it all day if I had the time
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game.It is so so so much fun. This game is really addicting.I love it I can never stop playing it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Endless fun and twists and turns with beautiful graphics. Beyond extraordinary. You can't snatch this idol away from me.<br />Temple Run is more fun than a barrel of apes!
B007BRJYF2|3.0|I enjoyed playing this on my kindle fire. It did have some issues though like in the maze two objects didnt show up so i quit then decided to try again and there they were big as day. Some of the move his object here games were hard to control but not impossible just headache inducing. There was supposed to be a bonus once you got done but I could not access it. Overall I liked it not the worst app Ive paid for.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so awesome that I can play it all day and night. Whoever created this game was a genius!
B000VSYDRM|5.0|I had never heard of this movie, and so was at first unsure of renting it. However, due to the reviews & the trailer, I thought I'd give it a try. It was truly an original, and it grabbed hold of me early on. It was disturbing, captivating, and complex. I highly recommend giving this one a chance.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple run is a fun, annoying, and addicting game. I do reccomend this game because it is entertaining and a very good way to pass time or stop boredom. Don't try this game of you are an over-achiver and need to win. There is no winning to this game,  it never ends.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I don't think Supernatural has fans. I think Supernatural has fanatics. The word \\"fan\\" implies that those who watch this show are passive. That they look forward to that one hour a week where they can escape and watch these boys fight what overwhelming \\"big bad\\" they are facing, turn off the TV set and then go about their daily lives. \\"Fanatic\\" is far more fitting for the followers of this show. We are obsessed. We read spoilers, we go to conventions, we write fan fiction, guess at plotlines, and emotionally invest in characters to the point where they become our family. This show has been on the air for SEVEN years and over those years there has been so much character and plot development that it has definitely paid off to be a fan. It is clear that the writers are smart because the consistently deliver succinct and intelligent writing and continue to move the show forward in a clear and sweeping development through Heaven and Hell, and now even Purgatory. The actors are talented, and can consistently deliver humor and heartbreak with rough raw emotion that makes the show feel realistic even if there are supernatural elements that could not happen in the real world.<br /><br />A lot of people have complained about the last couple years, but I think Dean says it all in Season 4's \\"The Monster at the End of this Book\\"-\\"For fans they sure do complain a lot\\" People like to whine and complain about the last couple of seasons but at the end of the day if they aren't watching then they don't have anything to complain about and if they can complain about the plotlines of the seasons that they supposedly hate then they're still watching!<br /><br />Each year there is a new surprise and new drama and new humor and the new greatness. I can't wait for Season 8 and all of the whiners will just have to continue to whine and I will continue to toss them up to representing the human condition. The show is constantly trying to out do itself, but in a realistic transition from it'sown past, which is incredibly rare in a series and should be respected greatly.<br /><br />Even after 7 years of being on the air, I continue to be invested in the characters and curious to how it will all turn out, not many long-running shows have the ability to keep you on the edge of your feet with perfect writing and a past that they are so aware of.<br /><br />If you are not watching it. You should start.

B002SRQ214|5.0|This CPU is perfect for gaming , but please do yourself a favor use an aftermarket CPU cooler cause the stock fan is loud as ****. It gets loud after 30 mnts of play .
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|\\"Trespassing\\" has everything! The funky, fun, and sexy dance tunes in the first half are such a blast, but I find myself equally drawn to the slower, more vulnerable and sensual songs toward the end.  I highly recommend the deluxe version with the bonus tracks. Runnin' is one of my favorite songs on the album! The lower register and vocal range are out of this world!
B004GYNPL2|5.0|This is easy to use and is one of the best apps I've downloaded. Copy the password to the clipboard and just paste. It's secure and couldn't be easier.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Bought this and couldn't put it down!! All three were good books.... Now what am I supposed to read?? Lpl
B003EYVY0E|5.0|Don't bother with the crybabies who whine and complain bc the extended version isn't included. First its not WB's fault, the directors of all but the first 2 films refused to include the extended versions. Chris Columbus is the only one who decided to put in the extended versions of 1 & 2. This is a great buy. The special features is what you should want it for. If you are only interested in the movie itself then go buy the single movie. Image and sound are superb. \\"Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 3: Creatures\\" is extremely interesting, as you can find out how they brought the many magical creatures to the big screen. Very much worth it.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg!!! they finally got it for the kindle fire!!! I love it I constantly play temple run, best game EVER!!:DD

B000P6PVLC|2.0|Had to pick a movie out of four others and decided to watch this one because of all the acclaim. I wish I had ignored it all. I want that time back. I learned more life lessons watching Legally Blonde 1, 2 AND 3. I feel like the director was taking advantage of the hype surrounding the United States' battle against terror and illegal aliens to make lots of money off of a pseduo foreign film. I don't want to give it only 1 star because the acting was great, but that's pretty much it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so sad that this game wasn't on the kindle fire but now that it is I am so happy!!!! trust me I love this game its so fun u love it to
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for it to come out on KF. My phone doesn't play it well anymore. I am beyond thrilled!
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Was I ever glad I bumped up against whatever HBO channel was showing PAUL recently.  I remember the theatrical trailers coming out last year and thought the film looked lame; boy, was I ever dense.  PAUL is remarkably witty and energetic and fast-paced and downright charming.  I've seen some of the other offerings by the Brit duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost; these two comedic writers and actors are as versatile as they are talented, and they're on their A Game here.  And just the thought of Seth Rogan furnishing the voice of the ornery alien makes me giggle automatically.  Throw in very entertaining performances by Jason Bateman, Bill Hader, Jane Lynch, and Kristen Wiig (just to name a few)--topped by a cameo by a certain sci-fi actress that pays off in spades--and you've got one whale of a tale about an alien that flees the G Men and enlists the aid of two nerds to get back home.  The subsequent madcap adventures are a hoot, all augmented by the alien's irascible disposition.<br /><br />Yes, it's predictable and often contrived, and the constant cultural parody flirts somewhat with becoming too thin, but Pegg, Frost, and Rogan carry the freight and deliver belly laughs by the bushel.  In particular I enjoyed the zingers Paul hurls at those who insist extraterrestrials don't exist; he gives them all the proverbial middle finger.  It's grand that so many darn fine comedies have been made as of late, and PAUL is certainly one of them.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
0891419063|5.0|This is perhaps the finest memoir of WWII ever written, I've read dozens. Such a powerful, yet simple account of a man's battle in the pacific. It details the horrors of the war and provides insight to men that fought there. Please, read this and get it to anyone who enjoys military history, or poignant literature.
0545265355|4.0|[[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]]I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the 'Hunger Games' Trilogy especially the first and second books. The ending of the first book had me hooked so I had to read the second book to find out what happened with the characters. I read the first two books in 4 days during my downtime. I admit it took me twice as long the read the 3rd book but I did enjoy it and liked the ending. I just hope that the next two movie installments do justice to the books.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. It's so addictive.  simple gameplay and getting all the unlockables is possible without having to spend real money.

B0086700CM|5.0|I didn't think it would happen. Temple Run for the Tablet and Kindle Fire. IMPOSSIBLE!!!!! All the other games that try to be like this failed. Nothing can compare to temple run. Number of Stars - &infin;&infin;&infin;&infin;&hellip;
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a terrific and awesome game. Beware it is extremely addictive do not get it if you have tests coming up because you will not study!

B006GHA9VQ|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber delivers again!  This opera was amazing!  The music was moving and the story line was what one would expect from the writer of the Phantom of the Opera.  Not dissapointed at all!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great storytelling.  Technically Hard Scifi, though not 'big' Scifi (not set off world, no aliens or fantastic super-future technology etc.).  It focuses on human stories.  Not my usual 'cup of tea', but it was a joy to read and I'm glad I did.  I'll happily read any follow-on works.  I would have paid more for it and now I've read it I'd say it is worth more than I'd have paid :)
B001QWBM62|1.0|As for recording quality and functionality, can't complain. What I can complain about is quality of manufacture. My H4n is a little over a year old (so, out of warranty). It's been used maybe a dozen times at the most, in very mundane settings. All of a sudden, the battery unit stops working. Still works with AC power, but no battery. Sent it in for repair and it cost me $155. That's more than half the cost of brand new. Will not purchase another piece of Zoom equipment.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This is a very good video of the show.  I really enjoyed the show in New York and this is a great way to relive the show at home whenever I want.  Ramin K is a good Phantom, but hard act to follow after seeing Micheal Crawford in the role.  Ramin is a very close second.

B0086700CM|5.0|So glad this is FINALLY on the Kindle Fire. I can put it down! It's like a new game every time. So much fun!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love these types of games.  Once you get used to how the boxes are marked it is really addictive!  I am playing on my smartphone so it is a little tedious with the small screen but i know it would be AWESOME on a larger screen!  At least the zoom feature helps alot.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could hardly put this book down, it is that good. Fast paced, with twists and turns I was enthralled from beginning to end. I look forward to reading \\"Mission Flats\\" next.
B007C9N4H8|4.0|This was a very nice kids movie, with funny and sad parts. I loved it from start to finish. Cute songs (Muppet or Man is def. my favorite song) and great acting. The only con with this is that if you stream it from Amazon, it will be kind of scratchy and dithered. Go buy it on DVD or Blu-ray, cause it will be clearer, and it's a good movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Great time killer. Fun for all ages. I think they should come out with more games like this. I would recommend this game to everyone that can get it. I wouldn't mind paying 1.99 for this.
0439023521|5.0|This was my absolute favorite book. I love it so much. There is just the right mix of action and love. I can't say any more, or i'll be tempted to spoil it for you. Go read it! :)
B007JUWM64|2.0|I was very sad to see such talented actors in such a poorly done movie. I hope they all got a good payday for being in this stinker of a movie.
0439023491|5.0|This is such a good book. I read the first one in a day, then i read this one in a day (or night, cuz i stayed up till midnight reading it) and then i read the third on the next day. They were all so good i couldn't put them down. This one had a very nice twist to it. Go read it right now, unless you've never read the first one, in which case you need to go read that one first and then come back and read this one. :D
B005NF2UE6|2.0|I put this cd - labeled \\"Here and Now\\" into my laptop.  It came up....\\"The Long Run\\" which is a previous album and all the songs are listed for THAT album.  When you play them, it is the music from \\"Here and Now\\".  This is messing with my media player!!!!!!  Love the music..... that is why it got two stars. Would like to know my options since this is a cd and an opened product??????
B0086700CM|5.0|I reply like its reply fun to play any time I love this game.  :) I want the whole world to play this game. so get it u will not be sorry u will not I promise. get this game. now now now now now get this game now now please get this game now now now now
B007QXU0ZO|4.0|Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros' second album, HERE continues the trend of uplifting folk and revival music. Marked by choruses of folks singing, stomping drums, and hand claps, it's hard not to break a smile at most of these songs. HERE is a great album to mark the beginning of summer: it's bright, passionate, and infectious.<br /><br />Incorporating many of the retro sounds of the 60's and 70's, Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros doesn't really sound like a band that belongs in this decade. While most of the band's contemporaries generally focus on melancholia, HERE is mostly very uplifting and optimistic. Lead singer Alex Ebert feels like a conductor leading a church revival band at times; the sermon, instead of focusing on any particular religion, is all about love. In particular, back-up singer (or co-vocalist) Jade Castrinos really brings the passion in these songs -- it's good to see more of her from the band's last album.<br /><br />HERE is a good follow up to the last band's album Up From Below, but it doesn't quite exceed it. Many of HERE's best songs are loaded in the front, making the second half of the album sparkle a little less (its content is much less upbeat too).<br /><br />This band seems to be very polarizing, so I would really recommend sampling this album before making a purchase. Fans of the Polyphonic Spree, Mumford & Suns, Arcade Fire, or 60's revival will really enjoy a lot of what this album has to offer. Recommended highlights to sample: \\"Mayla,\\" \\"I Don't Wanna Pray,\\" and \\"That's What's Up.\\"
B0083GQKQG|5.0|This film was so good I had to watch it twice. This is a classic sociopath, I do believe that some children are just born without empathy, they are just empty. Not like some, I do not blame the mother, she tried to bond with him but was unable to because his genetic makeup was just that way. I had the feeling though when Kevin was affectionate with his father it was just a facade, he did not like his father either, or sister, or anyone. If you have no children this movie will certainly make you think about wearing a condom or two.
B007R0Y7VO|5.0|Should become a classic. Excellant. Would watch it over and over. It truley is a great movie: action, emotion, love and makes you tihink!
B0086700CM|5.0|Anyway. Yeah, this is a great game. Very happy they finally got it for Kindle Fire. :D if you haven't already you should get this app. #justsayin
B003EI2EH2|3.0|The book offers great information, but i feel it very technical... not for a daily life. Also recommends very expensive o or hard to get things.
0439023513|2.0|I saw the movie Hunger Games before reading the book.  Then I read the book, saw Hunger Games again, and read Catching Fire and Mockingjay.  I like Hunger Games very much, but the next two books were very tedious.  I thought I was watching a video game in Mockingjay.  It was off the charts in imagery, which was very hard to follow in words.  I needed visual aids, but will NOT be seeing the 2nd and 3rd movies.  Too graphic and unrealistic in my view.  Gore galore.  All in all, I think all three books and movie are overrated.
0345803485|1.0|I doubt I'll say anything about this book that hasn't already been said many times over. My book club decided to read this book since it was in the news, so we all started together.<br /><br />People have said that this book changed their lives, but I surely cannot see how. The book is so poorly written that it was extremely hard to wade through. Seriously, if there was one more argument between the main character's 'inner goddess' and her 'subconscious', my inner editor was going to get out her red pen. By halfway through the book, my inner feminist was also well and truly pissed off, since the theme of the innocent girl being assaulted and beaten (and loving it) by the poor, warped rich guy was just a little too much to bear. While we were slogging through this, people in the group started making jokes about making it into a drinking game that required the reader to take a shot every time the author used phrases like 'down there.' Two shots if 'down there' was italicized for extra effect. (Yes, it really was, I'm not kidding).<br /><br />I'm fine with books depicting naughty activities between consenting adults, but let's face it, this book is just porn and not even well-written porn at that. Most of the people in my book club bailed before we finished it, myself included. One of us actually read to the end of the series (all three books) and then was annoyed at herself for doing so.<br /><br />If you want something steamy, go read Anais Nin but don't waste your money on this. You'll be joining the rest of us in wanting to send the author a thesaurus before you're finished.
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|Great quality product! Love it! The only issue is that Amazon description indicates that the set includes a towel, however it is not part of this set. Same exact set made by Educo includes the towel, but not the one by Hape.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I absolutely love this case. I like the fact it has a strap for your hand to go through when you fold back the top. It is secure. It was a little difficult for me to get it in, but hubby had no problem. It is really secure!!!!  NO chance of it coming out!! It also will fold back for hands free. Like when you are cooking from one of the books you've down loaded.
B000H305U0|5.0|Since this cd came at a few years ago, I have heard most of the songs on it, but it does'nt compare to hearing the entire album in completion.  The songs meld together, creating almost a story line filled with catchy hooks and smooth rythems. Justin shows that he is definately the one to bring sexyback!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|yes finally they put this on for the kindle fire and it used to be only for ipod and I'm so glad they did this it made my day
030746363X|5.0|This book covers many things about the human body and can be used to get toned or gain a huge amount of muscle mass. Timothy Ferriss covers everything form sex to a perfect fitness diet. Timothy Ferriss has spent ten years developing his knowledge of his methods and has proven them, using himself as the human guinea pig.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its the best I play it all the time. I would play it forever if I could. I think y'all would love it
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell hit the nail on the head and produced a great book. This book (in short) is about analyzing a situation in the blink of an eye. It refers to professionals and everyday people. It gives examples about how and why your brain processes information so quickly. Anybody can read this book and everybody should read it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can play this game for ever. it is awesome. if you have never played this I strongly suggest trying it
B007V2UGPE|4.0|fun game but once you get to upper levels you have to pay for tokens for better up grades or replay the levels a ton to win
B003UESJ9M|5.0|This movie is great for any family a very important message how we act in our own lives. We should be very thankful for our GOD and family.
0345803493|5.0|Not the best written books that I have ever read, but these books are very entertaining. It kept me interested and wanting to read more. I really enjoyed them! Very addicting and entertaining!
B0086700CM|4.0|its a fun game but its got no point I no I'm going-to-get-alot-of-hate-but-come-on on the other hand one of the best-games-on-kindle.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is a fun filled game! The graphics are great and kept my interest for hours!!!! I WANT MORE! Please please make some as soon as possible!
1936891026|5.0|I started looking for books to combat procrastination, I needed help to continue writing my novel. If you are in the same path, sooner or later you will discover the Steven Pressfield book. I hope our reviews shorten the time you spend trying to find useful resources to continue creating.<br /><br />This book does a lot of critical clarifications. All of them are needed to face the destiny we want against the reality we have. The definition of PRO performance is one of the major clarifications. If you decide to be a PRO in the activity you want to develop, your obstacles will be reduced, some, totally eliminated. Believe me.<br /><br />The resistance definition is a key concept. Its characteristics, its performance; when you understands that it lives inside you, that it is a force of nature, that never rests and that it is impersonal...then you can see your art, your goal from a different point of view.<br /><br />If in doubt, just read the Robert Mckee's introduction. Just that. You'll be tempted or challenged, or both.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run it finally came out for kindle fire. it is awesome temple run is fun for all ages so I would buy it and its free.
0062082353|5.0|An interesting and easy read. Certainly worth taking the time to read.  I really enjoyed the storyline. A no bs account describing the dangerous tasks required by our nations best marksmen.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is amazing. straight up. I thought at first it was going to be pretty stupid, but then I started playing it and couldn't put it down.

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best game anyone could play its the best I cant even tell u how that's how good it is so get this app
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This app crashed the second time i used it! I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, i've downloaded the updates, NOTHING WORKS! Can't open it at all:(
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This is by far the coolest show I've ever been a fan of. Walt and Jesse have such an awesome on and off relationship and the trouble they've gotten themselves in and out of have been so fun to watch. LOVE IT!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I really love this game! it is totally impossible to stop playing it, it feels like! there aren't any problems as far as I can see!!!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I like the case well enough but am disappointed with its ability to stand up.  I would call this a design flaw.  It doesn't stay in the slot very well when you are trying to watch something on the Kindle Fire.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like it :) just a little slow on my kindle fire but other than that its very addicting and fun!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't think I've ever read anything as fast as I read the 1200 words of Wool Omnibus! I could not put it down and I was excited for what was going to happen. I'm getting ready to start First Shift: Legacy this evening and I fully expect it to be just as intriguing and great!<br /><br />The writing is rich and detailed... it plays out in your mind like a suspenseful thriller ... the characters are fantastic.. even the ones that you get to know briefly.. there are twists and turns and some unexpected roads taken. I loved it and I cannot wait for more!<br /><br />It's the best $6 I ever spent. I can't wait for the movie!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|great Bible app. mostly like the devotional blogs and daily Bible lessons you can get along with a very easy to navigate Bible app
B0084P9202|3.0|Throw me in the mire with the rest of the apologists with this one, as i too am a huge Sigur Ros fan, but as you can probably decipher from my supercilious title for this review i was regrettably disappointed by this album. Let me start with the positives though, firstly Sigur Ros have shown considerable courage in choosing to mainly avoid post rock cliches this time around, the most obviously absent of these being the slow build tension and cathartic release technique that i personally think has been done to death over recent years. Admittedly These guys do it better than almost anybodyelse which can be evidenced in all of their previous albums post Von.<br /><br />This decision to move in a new direction leaving behind arguably the bands greatest strengh is something i can't help but admire and occasionally it's been known to yield some truely amazing results the most recent example being when Radiohead decided to move away from the highly successful alt rock of Ok Computer to the abstract electronica of Kid A. Unfortunately for Sigur Ros though this album is more comparable to R.E.M's transition from the sprawling eclecticism of New Adventures to the politely underwhelmng Up which although pretty, failed to really captivate or galvanize a strong emotional reaction like their previous work had done.<br /><br />Valtari doesn't do anything audaciously wrong here, the music like Up is also pretty, delicately ambient and i'd imagine quite soothing to listen to if you had a migraine or were looking to get an early night and needed something relaxing to help you doze off. That last sentence might sound unfairly flippant but the unobtrusive feel of this album doesn't do anything to elevate Sigur Ros to the next level of musical perfection (i think they already achieved that with agaetis byrjun). Instead it justs sounds a little tired and lacking in ideas, the less is more approach is something they're not necessarily unfamiliar with () is faily narrow in scope and repeats a similar formula throughout it's 8 tracks, the differences between the two abums though are that () has a devastatingly powerful feel that is capable of flooring you at various times throughtout it's 70 minute playing time. Valtari has no such moments and remains largely innocuous throughout, comapared to Sigur Ros's former albums this sounds plaintively tame, taken on it's own merits it's a pleasant collection of ambient soundscapes that are ideal for background music.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its a cute game.  kind of lose interest after a while. wish it were a little more involved. sometimes it freezes up the kindle.  there r many other apps that r a lot more engaging.
B0086700CM|3.0|its a fun game but you meed to wait amonth before you.download it. its very jumpy. and the graphics are edgy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a interesting peek at a different lifestyle.  I really enjoyed reading about the interaction between the characters both in the bedroom and in public.
0330535420|1.0|Starts woodenly, proceeds unconvincingly and turns into a sort of video-game shootout towards the end. I didn't bother finishing it and suggest others not bother starting.
B00130UFY2|5.0|Nothing too amazing here.  I was watching this movie which I had recorded on my DVR and due to a sporting event or something, the timing was off and I didn't get the last half hour so I streamed it from Amazon Instant Videos for $2.99 so I couled see the last half hour.  Everything worked out great, so..good review!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I bought this speedlight because I needed something other than the on camera flash.  I didn't want to spend a lot and I found this one in my price range.  It does what it is supposed to do.  It was a really good purchase.
B0086700CM|4.0|They finally have the game! Anyway, the game is super fun,hard to control because of the device, and it kinds of slows down sometimes while I'm playing. But it's enjoyable. : )
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an awesome game! I highly recommend it, though it can lag on kindle fire, it is very addicting and very fun!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written I just can't get into it. It reminds me of a porno version of Twilight that's written badly.
B007P6VM04|3.0|This CD will please anyone who loved the pop songs and wished there was a little less Broadway music in the TV show about Broadway musicals. I was disappointed that so many of the songs I hum during the day and watch over again on DVR are missing. No song from the finale is included, and my personal fav Yes Men is not there either. I would happily buy a double CD to get it all, but will take what I can get and download the rest. Might I suggest a DVD with some key numbers as well?
B0086700CM|3.0|ook this was a pretty good app but you should add a few things like maybe more perks. like upgrade.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|i love this soundtrack and originally purchased it in september of 2008 and i still have the same cd! murray does such an amazing work on the music that the second you turn on your cd or iPod or whatever you listen to it's as if your back on the sofa (or sometimes behind the sofa with such monsters as daleks, cyberman and weeping angels) watching an episode of doctor who! The second that it's turned on you can see the scenes in your head and feel the emotions as if you had just watched the episode itself on the tele. A MUST BUY FOR ANY DOCTOR WHO FAN! and my favorite out of all the doctor who soundtracks so far.
B0086700CM|5.0|I find myself saying....&quot;just once more before I...... &quot; why is there a minimum word limit? I want to go play! lol
006016381X|5.0|\\"The Holographic Universe\\" contains very interesting information about our universe and about reality.  I am a very spiritual person and have gone through a profound spiritual awakening, and I have therefore, experienced nearly all psychic phenomena from one time or another, and I can say that the information in this book is accurate based on my own personal experiences.<br /><br />I liked how the author mentioned that while we dream, we visit parallel universes.  Although it is not mentioned in the book, it has been said that while we sleep, a portion of our consciousness exits our body and visits the spirit world.  While there, we visit departed loved ones, etc.  It has been my own personal experience and the experience of more and more people nowadays that we also cross over into parallel universes during waking consciousness, but most people don't notice the subtle differences between the realities.  I have been consciously aware of experiencing this phenomenon for a few years now.  So, I know that we experience it while sleeping also.<br /><br />The book also mentions that what exists in our reality is a vast ocean of waves and frequencies, and our brain simply converts them into concrete objects.  I get a lot of prophetic information and information such as this through my dreams while I sleep, and I once dreamt that our reality indeed consists of a bunch of waves of energy.  Actually, everything is energy.  There is nothing that exists that isn't simply energy.  Scientists have even proven with experiments that our thoughts are simply energy.<br /><br />I enjoyed how the book discussed multiple personalities and how a drunk person can automatically become sober when they change personalities.  I experienced something similar to this while doing Past Life Regression.  In my current life, I read, write, and speak Spanish fluently and have been a professional translator, have used the language while employed by several companies, and it has been the language spoken in my home since 1995.  However, when I did Past Life Regression, and I totally integrated myself into the personality of who I was back in the 1880's, I tested that personality to see if she could speak Spanish, and I couldn't even do something as elementary as count from one to five in Spanish.  So, I found it interesting how the book mentions that changing from one multiple personality to another totally changes a person's speech patterns, their personality, and even their physical characteristics.  When the focus of our consciousness changes, much can change.<br /><br />The book also mentions that the physical body is possibly not solid at all but instead is a hologram.  I have witnessed with my own eyes that this is truly the case.  I have seen myself shift from looking old, gray, and haggard to looking like I'm vibrant, glowing, and 18 years old instantaneously while looking in the mirror.  Others that I have conversed with have witnessed this in themselves and in me also.<br /><br />I also enjoyed how this book mentioned imprints from the past (past events, people, etc. being imprinted at a scene).  The book even mentions that emotions, etc. are imprinted.  I have witnessed this to be true also.  While on vacation in Mexico at the Mayan ruins, I felt an overwhelming feeling of bloodshed there.  It felt like a lot of death had occurred there.  I have noticed this in other geographical areas as well.<br /><br />The book also mentions that 60-68% of our dreams are premonitions.  Mine certainly are!  I take the time to interpret them everyday and would encourage everyone to do so as well.<br /><br />The author also mentioned about viewing one's future, and then when the future event comes to pass, one can feel their OBE (out of body experience) self with them in the scene in the future.  I have experienced this phenomenon, and I have also seen other people frozen motionless at certain moments during my life.  Although the book didn't mention this fact:  Lifeis like a video tape.  We can insert ourselves in at any point from the spirit world or from the Earth and then actually feel or even see ourselves there once we reach that point in time.<br /><br />This book is filed full of such fascinating information, and it also provides scientific information for the skeptics.  I would highly recommend this book if you want to understand reality and our universe more.  I also recommend keeping an open mind towards phenomena that is beyond the realm of of physical world and what can be perceived with the physical senses.  The more you remain open minded, the more you may experience some of the phenomena that that this book mentions.<br /><br />I would also recommend that you read the following book, as it's content is fascinating and similar to \\"The Holographic Universe\\".  It is available here on Amazon:  [[ASIN:1475095244 Traveling To Parallel Universes]]
B005H2IAM6|4.0|...but my expectations were pretty low. To be fair, this is a fun romp through the Star Blazers mythos, but the pacing and editing is comparable to Phantom Menace. There's far too much \\"and then this happened, and then this\\" and then it's just over. There's a workable climax but it's kinda just filled with death and sacrifice and is far less interesting than the first half of the movie. They had absolutely no idea what to do with the characters after the ship launched. Just demonstrations of unearned camaraderie amongst the crew and dubious character development.<br />Don't get me wrong, if you loved Star Blazers as a kid you simply must own this. It's worth that.
B0086700CM|5.0|Wow! Seems like such a! simple game...NOT! You have to stay alert at all times. Gotta know when to make your next move, and it comes at you just like a _______.
B0086700CM|5.0|the game is really cool I would recommend it to anyone it is so extremely awesome that is why I rated it 5 stars.
1576875776|4.0|It's a shame that Vivian was not recognized during her lifetime for her excellent work. I would really like to see more - will gladly purchase any additional volumes as they become available. I noticed that some reviewers did not like the sepia-like effects in the book - I disagree. These pictures are awesome as is!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the coolest game ever! When you play make sure you have time to do at least 10 runs because you'll be addicted from the start! : )
B0086700CM|5.0|its the best game I have and all the people who gave it one stare shame on u its the best game I have<br />............GET THIS GAME!!!!!!
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Awesome movie.  Marvel has done great work over the last 10 years.  Can't say enough about Robert Downey.  He plays the part well.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book.  I couldn't put it down, the creativity alone was worth 5*'s.  But the fact that at the end you did not feel that there were any lose strings (or ribbons) was amazing.  I am so happy that I read this book, but so sad that it is now over.  I can't wait to see what Erin;s next book will be like.
B001DRF84W|5.0|I liked the 2003 Hulk better than the 2008 Incredible Hulk.  I like the Hulk's personality exploration in the 2003 version and the character development was better understood.  Action packed.  Blu Ray delivers awesome picture and unbelievable surround sound.  Excellent movie.
0307957934|1.0|Plot was predictable, nothing surprising here.  Not much depth to the technology or markets either.  Not a good book in my opinion, and I have read all of Harris other books and enjoyed them.
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|Can't wait to see the next adventure.  Movie was not what I expected, but I was quite surprised how good the movie and story line was.  CGI Animation was unlike anything I've ever seen and some of the action towards the end of the movie was great!  Good movie and will be watching again and again.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game I ever played. I think it is like a hand eye coordination. I hope you like it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I loved the first book in the series and this second one started out so good, but it is almost like the author got tired of writing and just hurried through the second half.  Not sure if I will read the third one or not.  This one did leave you hanging, but I don't know if I care enough to continue.
B0086700CM|4.0|its an awesome game I'm so greatfull that they got this game on here. but its really glitchy. when I try to slide my finger it doesn't respond. awesome game though
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you're a prude or super against \\"vanilla sex\\", please don't read this. I don't even read novels... I'm a full time student and got a break for summer to pick up something other than a textbook and had this book suggested to me.<br />I'm disturbing in the beginning, but once you get more than halfway through the book you CANNOT put it down. Make it through page 200 and you will be hooked!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is tons of fun. You can play it for hours and trying to beat your last score will keep you playing.
B006ZZCLV0|5.0|I got these books for my son, a senior in high school.  He was assigned to read the Hunger Games book.  He has never even seen the movie yet, but he loved the Hunger Games book, he could hardly put it down and wanted the other books.  If found them for a great price, and they came quickly.  He was so happy, and it made a great graduation gift.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is epicly awesome and now its for the kindle fire!! Im realy excited thanks to the people of Amazon!!!!!!!!!  :b

B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come out on the kindle and was so excited when it did.  it is so addicting and I love it.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is an outstanding game that finally came out on the android market. They should get other games that are found in the apple app stores.
B002U6CJCE|1.0|1.) if you want to just see violence!  Fast forward to the last 18 min. (it is just a non stop fight scene for 18+ min,  after about 14 min it got really boring)<br /><br />2.) if you want any kind of a plot (get another movie!)<br />Just think \\"x rated B type movie, and replace the sex with violence\\"<br /><br />3.) The first universal solder had a plot (I know, not much, but it had some), this one; not so much!<br /><br />4.) In the end, did they kick the bad guys ass (Not sure?) seems like the really bad guy kick the bad guys ass and squeezed his head, so ?? but the good solder Jean Claude fights the bad solders for 15 to 18 min.  and yes he kicks their ass.<br />I have to say it actually became boring.  I know action = boring???  If you don't believe me just watch it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an awesome and really fun game!!! get it!!! it is super fun!!!!!  it is easy and real cheap
B000W9DSVW|5.0|I had fast service i bought the movie set for a birthday gift and it arrived in plenty of time
B0052VUNHC|2.0|The characters were so selfish, self involved and foolish, I just never cared much about them. I was not rooting for the couple to make it.
B0086700CM|5.0|my little brother has a mental disability and i cant get his paws off the game! everyone should play! :)
0439023521|5.0|This book is one you can't put down!  Read on vacation and the only thing I didn't like was that I didn't get all three books at the same time.  Now I have to wait for book 2 and 3!
0425074811|5.0|Chariots of the Gods is an excellent book which tries to unveil the mysteries of the questions related to aliens in various periods of civilization.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game. its like alot of fun in one game.<br /><br />I hope everyone else enjoys this game too.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|one of the most entertaining puzzle games i've ever played. i would buy any addon packs or future releases without hesitation
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I didn't think that I was gonna like the game as much as I do but the game is very addicting. Simple game, but it does make you think in the later stages, plus it appeals to peoples destructive nature (lol). Simple to learn gameplay, a little skill and a lot of luck makes it a fun game to play. Sometimes ads can be annoying but hey its free. Have fun with flying birds of destruction.
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been waiting for this forever and they finally have it!  hallelujah!  luv this game . great graphics and way better than the jacked up stuff like cave run3d they tried to pull of as a quality game.
B0086700CM|5.0|love love it. great on phone and more on my kindle fire. I find it hard to put down.. great game
B0086700CM|5.0|cool cool coool x&ccedil;93oooooooooooofjjcj xbjsj bskdjn RUN<br /> fast hard fun djdjx nsbcji dkd foot ball djjd ffd a dff rrr sskxj riwa
B0073PPKNM|5.0|Melody Gardot has outdone herself on this album - if that possible.  She weaves lyric, melody and feel into a fabric you want to wrap yourself in for hours at a time. Bravo! Melody.  Your music takes me places not found on any map.<br /><br />If you are a Gardot fan your expectations will be surpassed.  If you are new to Gardot you are in for a treat!
B0086700CM|4.0|im a iphone owner so the games not new to me at all. i think for my kindle fire this games not too bad exactly the same but at times it has a very bad lag. fix please
B0086700CM|4.0|I'be never really understood this app until I got it on my fire.  The tutorial very clear and concise, and the gameplay is a fun repettlition game. I gave it 4 stars for the lag.  The lag isn't horrible, or else I would've given it three stars, but it does get annoying when I've gotten really far and die because of it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absoultely loved Catching Fire. I am not much of a reader, but I couldn't put this book down. I don't remember having books this good when I was a teen. Well written. I am currently glued to Mockingjay.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I now own all three of her legit video releases and this one by far is the best all of around.  I think Lover's Live allowed the band more freedom, but visually this one is just stunning.  I went to show in Anaheim (which was used as supplement footage for Ontario, California concert that presented here) and she was flawless then and this video is flawless now.<br /><br />My only gripe is that there should've been a Blu-Ray/CD combo as well.  Even if it added let's say $1 to the cost most fans would've bought that one.
B0016KJKIG|5.0|Not a lot to say, it's just like the one that came with my surge to begin with. My original one wore out. I'd had it probably 5-6 yrs, and use it everyday, several times a day.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My son got this game when I bought him a new Kindle Fire for his birthday (he turned 23). He liked it so much that he came over and put it on my KF. I love it! You can do a close up or you can zoom out. I even like the little song that goes with it lol. I play it several times a day.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game was definitely one of the best games I have played in a long time. So cool with the those evil monkeys just awesome.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|i love angry birds space but really only two worlds.if you dig around that it is pretty addicting.Im waiting for the update.
B007NESBK2|5.0|This is now one of my favorite concert DVD's, so much better than any of her previous DVD's, the audio is amazing and the lighting effects are awesome.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Final Book of the Hunger Games, Mockingjay, was delivered to my Kindle. Good book just like the two before it. Definitely worth your time.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Awesome album. A must get. Can not wait to see more from them.  I don't have twenty words to review. It is either good or bad. It is good.
B0086700CM|5.0|one of the first 'free app of the day' that i've downloaded and consistently played. highly addictive, but the &quot;run 500m without gaining coins&quot; objective has proven to be difficult. i'll keep playing until i get it though. fun game!!
0679805273|5.0|This is one of my favorite books from when I was younger. It's so fun to read, and doesn't fail to put a smile on your face. It's an inspiring book in my opinion. The pictures are of course Dr.Seuss inspired and creative as always. Very much adore this book and enjoy reading it every time!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|box time awesome cool bot shot got  characters with pool parties im saying randomness cool today totally making heat sweet
B003QOCTOM|5.0|I had had a long day and was looking for some easy down-time.  I wasn't expecting this show to be so great, but I really enjoy it. It's not at all an intellectual show, but it's cute, fun and enjoyable.
B004XS97KO|1.0|I LOVE Dr. Who, but I was unable to view this particular show because there were no captions or subtitles....please caption all videos.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me turning the pages into the wee hours of the night. I love the way she writes and I can't wait to read the next one!
B004X2M3SI|1.0|I LOVE Dr. Who, but I was unable to view this particular show because there were no captions or subtitles....please caption all videos.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Was a lovely book, kept me turning the pages! I felt it peated out towards the end, wish the ending had of been a bit stronger felt a bit cheated and wanting more!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very entertaining. it challenges you in so many different ways. different ways to get points. there are different games that many people like.
B0006HJEMC|3.0|Item came in time.  My son was happy and that's what mattered.  Quality of toy was okay.  Crazy glue is a must to keep the parts together and careful handling of the parts is necessary in order to preserve it.  Some parts broke because it was so small and plastic was thin.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|I enjoy the games, the puzzles are fun, but the interface needs work.  Sometimes it isn't good enough to play the game.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|....And what fun it is.<br /><br />*Spoilers Ahead*<br /><br />Marvel's \\"The Avengers\\" is an expertly-crafted movie that makes 2 1/2 hours fly by like....well....I don't really know...SOMETHING FAST. My thoughts on seeing this movie--the first time (yes, you WILL go to see this more than once)--were: \\"This was just as good as 'The Dark Knight'....how is THAT even possible?\\" Well...consider first that Marvel has always had the best storylines, and the know-how to mix all of their characters' comic books together into one, all-encompassing storyline. Then, consider they decided to apply said formula to their movies. Third, they went out and expertly casted the parts.<br /><br />How could this NOT be good?<br /><br />Who else but Robert Downey, Jr could be a multi-billionaire, techno-wizard, armor-wearing snark-artist? Acts like he doesn't care, but is willing to sacrifice his life to save New York.<br /><br />Chris Evans is Captain America. A 1940s guy living in the present day....brings \\"a little old-fashioned\\" to the role and shows old-fashionedness isn't cheesy, it just depends on how it is presented. It is presented very well, with Evans being the heart and soul (not to mention team leader) of The Avengers--by the way: love the shot, at the movie's end, of him on his motorcycle riding off into the sunset.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo, (great casting here; now I feel the Hulk movie franchise finally has hope) channels Bill Bixby in his performance (good idea!) but adds a \\"Hulk-sized\\" portion of world-weariness to his character...his over-the-shoulder \\"I'm always angry\\" is one of my favorite moments in an entire movie of favorite moments. And....The Hulk gets two more \\"Hulk-sized\\" moments that totally bring the house down.<br /><br />Oh, nice touch having Lou Ferrigno voice the Hulk.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth as Thor is the only character in the movie whom I feel was under-utilized. No fault of the actor's; he does a great job with what he is given....and DOES have hismoments (\\"He's adopted\\")....I just felt they didn't give him as much as they did the other three leads.<br /><br />Rounding out The Avengers are Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner as the assassin/couple: Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff) and Hawkeye. Ms. Johansson is a master interrogator (albeit by making use of quite unorthodox means). Hawkeye is the steely-cool expert marksman--I had my doubts as to how an archer could work in such a high-energy movie. It works.<br /><br />The Avengers are put together by SHIELD: Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury (need I say more?); Clark Gregg (Agent Phil Coulson, and very funny in the role); Colbie Smulders (Agent Maria Hill--doesn't get nearly enough screen time) and Stellan Starsgard.<br /><br />Loki is portrayed by Tom Hiddleston; whom, for a character thinking of himself as a god, brings some amusing vunerability to the character: His embarrassment at being unable to kill/brainwash Tony Stark: \\"This usually works.\\"; or, \\"If it's all the same to you, I'll have that drink now.\\"<br /><br />I was initially skeptical about this movie. I didn't think Loki was the best choice for a screen villain. Er, was I wrong....this tale of an immortal/meglomaniac/demigod/god-wannabe who enlists an alien race to help him conquer Earth (Question: if Loki *really* was a god, why would he need alien help?) made for some great popcorn, big-tent, summer viewing.<br /><br />....My other initial fear was that this wasn't going to be \\"The Avengers\\" as much as it would be \\"Iron Man and Friends\\".<br /><br />Thankfully, I was wrong again.<br /><br />To sum up: The Avengers is cinematic excellence. Many have complained about it being too long--and, the first 20 minutes or so setting up the story *do* take a moment....but once \\"Marvel's The Avengers\\" splashes across the screen: The movie takes off and never looks back. It is packed with great moments and memorable lines/one-liners. The action sequences are the best I've ever seen and it all looks real. SeemsI read somewhere online the battle in New York would have done (in reality) 39 billion dollars' worth of damage. You WILL believe it.<br /><br />Oh, one last thing: sit through ALL of the credits.<br /><br />Thank you, Joss Whedon and co.<br /><br />Please go all-out on the blu-ray release. Please.<br /><br />Quotes<br /><br />Natasha: \\"I'd sit this one out, Cap.\\"<br />Captain America: \\"I don't see how I can.\\"<br />Natasha: \\"These guys (Thor and Loki) come from legend. They're basically gods.\\"<br />Cap: \\"There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he isn't dressed like that.\\"<br /><br />Cap: \\"Dr. Banner, now might be a good time for you to get angry.\\"<br />Dr. Banner: \\"That's my secret, Captain.\\" (looks back over his shoulder at Cap) \\"I'm always angry.\\"<br /><br />Loki: (embarrassed) \\"This usually works.\\"<br />Tony Stark: \\"Well, you know, performance issues...\\"<br /><br />\\"The Avengers\\"<br /><br />PG-13 for language (non-harsh) and violence; no gore or sex to be found, parents.<br /><br />Marvel Studios in association with Paramount Pictures<br /><br />Directed by Joss Whedon<br /><br />**********UPDATE: Oct. 2, 2012**********<br /><br />Ok, the Blu-Ray/DVD has finally arrived, here is what you get:<br /><br />DISC 1<br /><br />*Blu-Ray Feature Film in 3D  (3D viewing requires Blu-Ray 3D player, 3D capable display and 3D glasses<br /><br />DISC 2<br /><br />*Blu-Ray Feature Film<br /><br />*An original SHORT: \\"Item 47\\".

0345803485|5.0|I really liked this series.  Going into it I thought it was going to be cheesy but it became addictive and I had to read all 3 books as quickly as i possibly could!  Definite beach read.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome I love it go temple run.my high score is 34456 all my friends have it.great game
B0086700CM|5.0|A fun filled insteds game first try hard hundredth easy! If you don't belive me ty it for your self.
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE THIS Game it is so time taking I would play it all the time if I was not in school
B007J4T2G8|5.0|People read books to escape not to criticize. These books are about two people who are very different and find love together. Some people may think the writing is bad but its really honest. My vote is the series is refreshingly different. Love is love in all its fifty shades. E.L. James is a mastermind.
B0043URV5U|5.0|I love, love , love Bob Seger and I have been putting off buying it. I am so glad that I purchased it. It has a lot of his hits and a few new songs too. I am absolutely glad that I made this purchase.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Anthony Ryan and I have got to say this is one of the best stories I have ever read. The writing is superb, the story kept me entertained from start to finish, I can't wait for the next book. This is a story that made me feel as though I was there, a story that made me feel for the characters. Vaelin is a character that I will remember for a long time. You know you have found a great story when you feel the pain, and the joy of the characters. I don't know what else to say except buy this book you will not regret it. Enjoy
B0070NSPCU|5.0|In a word awesome. Fantastic read, good story, action, well written, no editing issues. One of the best books I've read in awhile, highly recommend.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|On a steamy, hot summer evening in NYC in July 1983, thousands of die hard Diana Ross fans crammed into Central Park for her much anticipated free concert, being broadcast live all across the world. Shortly after she began, a huge thunderstorm rolled in and drenched the crowd, but that did not stop Miss Ross. Through the high winds and heavy rains and lightning, she just kept on singing, and refused to go anywhere, as she told her fans. And as she gave it her all and sang her heart out, the rain got even heavier. Unfortunately, she finally had to cut the concert short, but not before promising that she would be back the next day to do it all over again. And she did--under clear blue skies and an even rowdier Friday night crowd. (I heard that there were a lot of arrests due to purse snatching and fights after the second performance)<br /><br />I wasn't born until 6 years later in June 1989, but I am a big fan of Diana's music, and I highly enjoy \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\\" \\"Reflections,\\" \\"Pieces of Ice,\\" \\"Let's go up\\" and \\"Endless Love\\" (which was my parents' wedding song.) I would have definitely watched this had I been my current age, in 1983. And if I lived walking distance from Central Park I would've tried to go to this concert. I had no idea that she even did this until recently and so I had to buy a copy of it to watch it. I am amazed at the clear picture quality of the DVD (there are parts near the end which are blurry for some reason) after seeing low quality clips of it on Youtube. The commentary is great too, which gives great behind the scenes insight. I like the Day 2 recap with clips of various news stories about the concert from later that night, and sound bytes of the weatherman predicting severe thunderstorms for that evening when the show began, and other announcements from various radio programs, and what Miss Ross had to say when she was interviewed on the local news the next morning. I also enjoy the opening of the show, which has an Africantribal themed dance, and stills of Diana hiding in the tall grass like she's stalking her prey, intertwined with shots of the busy NYC streets.<br /><br />Only gripe is Pieces of Ice being cut from the dvd for licensing issues, but I found a good quality clip of it on Youtube and downloaded it.<br /><br />Just goes to show you that she is a true diva, superstar and legendary performer, not letting any rain or wind (or winter storm) make her suddenly stop her show.
B0086700CM|5.0|super fun. must get! run run run trip run eaten. run boost run run run win the game.  can't really beat it
B002VX3RCW|4.0|Nice one. Took this for diaper cacke decoration. Very soft toy. Good for infants. Does not get hurt. Can be used as teether.
B0086700CM|5.0|it so fun its so neat you have so many charters to choose from. And love to play with my brother second best game I ever played
B0086700CM|5.0|the game is great and I only stop for sleep food and school plus this review.  lolololollololololol I just love the game yeah!
B00001OH82|5.0|One of the few gems to come out in the 80's...  Love it!  Pretty thing - wow, c'mon...  How great is that... The Lennon cover \\"Working class hero\\" is better than the original or any other version I've had the pleasure of hearing... Just my opinion...  Bowie captures the aura of those lyrics and the band embodies the message thru out...
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm sooo excited this app finally came for the Kindle Fire!! Very addicting and adventurous!! I love it! Buy this app now!!! :D
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is an amazing set of books!  You will wish you could find a Mr. Grey for yourself.  Once you start reading you won't be able to put it down...except to have a \\"discussion\\" with your man.
B0086700CM|5.0|man i play so much i unlocked everything in two days im fully upgrated in everything my high score is 234-890-45667
B0086700CM|5.0|when I'm bored, this is the game I always play, I couldn't wait for this to come out in amazon!!! its so addicting!!!
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Love this app! Lots of fun. My 6yr old plays it as well!  stars! Would recommend. to anyone who loves pinball. It's just like the real thing!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run. It is so addictive but in a good way.! well that's my comment and I'm goin to play it now!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This was a very informative film. Unfortunately not enough people will ever see it. The Green Party of Tampa Bay @ The International Boba House Caf'e in Tampa FL is going to have a veiwing of it tonight. I so look forward to the discussions this film will create. My questions would be \\"How does the little guy protect himself from the disaster this is creating?\\" Any suggestion? Next \\"What is preventing this from being regulated?\\" \\"What can we do to prevent this from happening again?\\"
B004EBUXI0|5.0|This processor is good enough I'm still not thinking in buying anything in the short term; perhaps we are already at that point where processors are fast enough for anything. This model doesn't even have HT but i don't miss it, 4 physical cores work just fine, and it has that \\"turbo\\" mode where the processor gets slightly overclocked when using a single core. It's been rock solid, doesn't get too hot (around 50°C) with its stock fan. I'll be using it for many more years.<br /><br />I run Linux and this performs well doing anything: games, productivity, video, etc. Runs cool, saves power when not stressed.<br /><br />This model is not multiplier unlocked (you need model K for that), which means you can't do fancy overclocking on your own, but i never intend to. What for? this stuff is fast enough as it is and i rather have it last long.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|While overflowing with 80s nostalgia, this intelligent, fun, and fast-paced sci-fi adventure will delight readers of all ages.  This is without a doubt one of (if not the) best books I've read this year!
B0086700CM|5.0|I play Temple Run every day and enjoy the graphics and creativity of the main focus of this app.  My friend also loves it.  I reccomend this to any adventurers out there.<br />I have given this five stars as you can see.
0345803485|5.0|Love this series, the details of everything that's hopping makes you feel your tight there and the suspense.. . Couldn't put the books down!!
B0042IDMPG|5.0|I fell in love with this band the moment I stumbled upon \\"Elephants\\" and \\"Billie Holiday\\" while browsing through YouTube. I immediately set out to purchase this EP, and it became the smartest impulse buy I ever made. Every track on this album-sized collection is gold. Their sound has a dreamy and softly psychedelic feel to it, which is greatly enhanced by their fantastic and hypnotic vocals. Their hype is well worth it.
B004UXUX7S|3.0|What is this film really about? Betrayal, death, forgiveness, family? Or keeping Hawaii in Hawaiian hands, as climax of it may suggest? Plot seems to move slowly in different directions, and if it were a little longer, many viewers might have lost their patience.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I can't believe I found an album that every song gets me excited and i do not skip over!<br />WOW! The songs, the vocals, the beats, the lyrics, the vocals, the vocals, the vocals!!! OMG!<br />Trespassing is one for the collection!
B001E45XT4|3.0|This headset is awesome but when I tested the mic, it did not work. This is a BIG problem because I Skype a lot.<br />Your Friend, Max
0446572993|1.0|Terrible book.  While character development from the author is typically primitive, this was a new low with no depth and defined by overused simplistic clichés.  The plot, which from this author tend to be okay, had so many ill-defined subplots that most of the last chapter was used to explain how things fit together.<br />Couldn't wait to finish, but for the wrong reasons.
B0086700CM|5.0|amazing so cool awesome have you played this? good great :) I love to get coins and earn objectives woo cool
B005LLSZNM|1.0|I love this show and was so excited to watch the 4th season on my ps3 via Amazon. I ended up have to return the purchase because NOTHING has CC (closed captioning) !!!!!!! As a hearing impaired individual, it is imperative that CC be available. I was extremely disappointed.  I won't be ordering anything else until the option is available. Sadface.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun and it is addicting. you should really get this game and you will really enjoy that
B006QVRUS2|5.0|This is a very engaging film based on some great acting on a super hilarious plot with eye catching well humored acting. What else is there to say? Ya'll gone make me lose my mind.

This 2nd book must be read as this book contains a slow and gradual peek into the mysterious past of Lisbeth who I truly adore for being so smart and cool. After reading this book, Lisbeth has further awakened my lesbian tendencies.
0688101364|3.0|Not as happy as I hoped to be about her book...it's a little boring recipe wise after hearing from various people that they liked her recipes.  I found it lacking according to the things I like to bake and create as a chef.

0345803485|5.0|This book reminded me of a more sexually detailed and darker Judy Blume book and I loved Judy Blume.  Think her books Forever and Smart Women.  I could not put this book down once I started it.  Innocent virgin Ana falls for rich, sexy, sexually twisted Christian.  What I really loved most about this book was how the two main characters start to come together closer to what the other person really wants sexually (for Christian) and relationship wise (for Ana).  He surprises her in many ways that she ends up enjoying but is torn and confused about.  I found the dialogue in this book very captivating!  I cannot wait to read the other 2 books in the trilogy!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app! It does what I need it to do. It's simple and accurate. And it is easy to use. Perfect!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|First off when I saw minecraft I only wanted to play it because I love lego's and thought that they were similar. So now that this set came out my life is complete. It is a great set and creatively made. If you love minecraft and have a chance to buy it you should!
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I bought both versions of Vows, the import (for me it's an import as I live in the US) and the newest US version. I do agree that the \\"safe production\\" does not do her justice and she doesn't need \\"safe\\", at all. Live, she explodes. She is a phenom, truly.<br /><br />This is only the beginning and she has already impressed me so immensely that I can barely describe the impact that she and her music have made in my life.<br /><br />She has inspired me to be more creative, to buy a guitar and write, to sing, to paint. I have a hard time listening to some of her songs without getting very emotional as they so speak to me.<br /><br />To watch her perform live is breathtaking and mesmerizing. She puts every fiber of her being into it and to think she is only 22 years old as I write this review. She is mature and wise beyond her years.<br /><br />Buy this CD. The so-called \\"safe\\" production does not ruin the CD. As her first full- length piece of expression it is well worth owning. She is a great writer with a fabulous ear.<br /><br />On the US version, \\"Sally I Can See You\\" and \\"Come Into My Head\\" are the two additions to the original that I love the most as well as the surprise I got when I found out that the live from Sing-Sing Studio version of \\"Plain Gold Ring\\" was on this new CD as well! That is one of the most riveting performances ever recorded, in my opinion.<br /><br />I would buy this CD a hundred times over if it helped Kimbra in anyway to reach her potential. She is an artist to watch and to fall in love with for many years to come.<br /><br />Buying this CD is more than just buying some tracks of music to play in your house or your car. Kimbra is an \\"experience\\" and<br />if you're like me, once you take the time to understand and to know her, you'll want all the pieces of that experience. Kimbra, I wish you the most success you can possibly have.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game by far is the most addictive game I've ever played. I play for hours on end! I love the challenge of beating myself over &amp; over again. EVERYONE in the UNIVERSE needs to play this game!!
B008469DGY|4.0|enjoy how realistic surrounding pictures are. like game very much.  would recommend this game even if you dont like golf.  it does not take any kind of skill at all to play.
0307387178|5.0|Into the Wild By John Krakauer<br />By: Eli Morell<br /> Into the Wild completely different than any book I have ever read. It has everything you look for in a novel written by the main character, but it isn't that. It is a journalist's perspective of the story but he is able to portray the ideas and what happened as if he was the person that he writes about in the book. When you read Journalism you mostly see blank facts. From the way this book is written there is emotion and feeling expressed throughout all of the author's research. I highly recommend this read it is enthralling.<br /><br />In the book the author goes through the life of Christopher Johnson McCandless. This young man ran away from his family on a road trip that eventually results in living in the wild forests of Alaska and dying. Mr. Krakauer perfectly portrays the life of this man and his journey thorugh the world. We have to understand who he is and why he did this the author gives that information to us. He also talks about why Chris ran away from his family. The most proment idea in the book is what Chris talked about with other people and the reputation that he spread.<br /><br />The book seemed inspiring to me because Chris manages to get where he does in life because of persistence he loves the world in all its beauty and that is how he did what he did he persisted.  The Author portrayed very well how Chris felt about his family and why he did his action but he sometimes does not shed light on Chris's faults. He makes him seem too much like an angel which I don't like so much.<br /><br />All in all it is a great book and the fact is it teaches us that we must persist and do what we love. We can always accomplish something if we try. We also have to learn do be independent and to get around in life just by being good people. A very good read I recommend it when you need some inspiration.
B0029LHX1W|4.0|\\"Child 44\\" is the first book in the Leo Demidov trilogy by Tom Rob Smith. Leo is an MGB (later KGB) agent who is in love with the Soviet Union and hunts down fellow citizens who might pose a political risk to the wellbeing of the system. In line with Soviet propaganda, the communist society is \\"crime free\\", as the happy proletariat is incapable of committing acts such as murder. So when one of Leo's colleagues loses his son in what appears to be a gruesome murder, Leo convinces the family to concede that the boy died in a train accident. But dead boys and girls keep popping up across the Ukraine, all killed in the same manner. Leo can no longer ignore the murders and embarks on a rogue investigation, risking his career and his life. He is accompanied in his quest by his wife Raisa, who becomes his moral compass.<br /><br />The book is based on the true story of serial killer Andrei Chikatilo, a.k.a. the Rostov Ripper. Smith does a fantastic job of describing life of ordinary citizens in the Soviet Union created by Joseph Stalin: the constant fear of being arrested for saying (or thinking) out of party line, the monolithic education system (Raisa is a teacher of politics), the dreaded security police, the forced hospitalization in mental hospitals, the squalid living conditions, the empty shops, and much more.<br /><br />This is not an easy book to read, and it is definitely not your run-of-the-mill crime thriller. Leo is a real anti-hero, a person who did terrible things and is now full of remorse. Yes Smith managed to create a real character, a person the reader can identify with, and not one of those plastic-type detectives that are unfortunately so common in this genre.
B007MDB71O|4.0|I think that this is a typical film that Hollywood like to produce now days almost like on a production line. The story is not much and done too often, reluctant hero who gets dragged into a war against evil.<br /><br />The hero John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) I thought was acted well. I thought his character was interesting. Everyone else I thought were only reasonable.<br /><br />The special effects and filming were brilliant. Some of it reminded me of starwars.<br /><br />Overall slightly above-average  story with brilliant special effects and filming. So I give it a four.<br /><br />If you do see it make sure it is on a big screen in Blu-ray.<br /><br />Would I see it again? No<br />Do I recommend it? Well, it is the sort of film that kids will like and their parents can tolerate. Worth seeing but do not be sorry if you miss it.

B0086700CM|5.0|one of my friends was playing it and I wished that I could get it on my kindle because it was so fun. Now that the the kindle fire has it; I finaly got it. This game is so fun and adicting. You will like it too.
B0086700CM|5.0|Never heard of this game before it became Number 1 in the app store for FREE. Downloaded it and now I am addicted to this amazing game. It is easy to use and addictive. I ran down the battery on our Kindle Fire playing it all day long :)
0553801473|4.0|Good book. Shakes off the monotony of \\"A Feast For Crows\\" which was awfully boring except the ending.<br /><br />I look forward to the rest of the series again now.<br /><br />I have to poo.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app. I am addicted to it and its incredibly awesome. Temple run is the best game ever. the person who invented it must be rolling in the doe. I LOVE TEMPLE RUN!!!!!!!!!!
1932100660|5.0|After reading this book I changed my entire life. I gave up meat, dairy, and eggs.

B005SODYGA|5.0|I just discovered Rammstein because they were playing a concert here in Minneapolis and I wasn't familiar with their music so I purchased this CD.<br />Great CD.  I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes this type of music.... and why wouldn't you?  Solid from start to finish.  Makes me want to go out and buy each individual CD.  (Also saw them in concert... one of the best shows I've ever seen... and this is from someone who's been to upwards of 200 concerts.  EPIC.)  Buy this CD!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have just finished the second book in the series and I am fully planning on reading the third. I would agree with some of the more sceptical reviews that say the writing is repetitive, refreshing discription is a rare find these days. Also, the sex is a little unrealistic, on that note, would you pay to read about sex where the man got off 5 out of 5 times and the woman averaged 2-3 out of 5??? The answer is no, if I pay to read erotica I want to indulge in the ultimate fantasy where two people can endlessly and easily please one another. And I feel sorry for the readers who cannot relate to Ana's feelings for Christian. I think it's a pity that not everyone has had a really steamy beginning to a relationship where you can't keep your hands off one another. The relationship that leads to your first sexual awakening, afraid to try new things and at the same time craving the knowledge and feeling of new experiences. Overall I think thats what this book is about, first times and learning to grow in sexual and emotional relationship with another person. To be scared out of your mind but take the plunge anyway because you only live once and at the time its what you NEED.
B004HZ14QS|5.0|This is another great Weather Report CD! This is the final version of the band, with bassist Victor Bailey, percussionist Jose Rossy, and drummer Omar Hakim forming the rhythm section. They had the unenviable task of following Jaco Pastorius, Robert Thomas, and Peter Erskine, and I must say, they came through with flying colors! This CD featured mostly new material, which was very refreshing, but to accommodate those who liked the old tunes, the band played a five song \\"greatest hits\\" medley. I wished a DVD would be included, like \\"Live in Berlin 1975\\". Regardless, this recording is another gem for Weather Report fans!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Wonderful games for children and parents. I would recommend this app to anyone. Perfect app for road trips or vacation. Keeps you entertained for hours!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Whoever created this app should be hugged.  It is a brilliant idea, executed to perfection. It's easy to use and navigate. It's soooo much better than Google+.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|This was a fun and interesting game! I would not recommend for children under 14 though. One thing that was bad was I thought there would be more to do other than combine objects. There are games but one is boring and the other says coming soon.
B005JCT4B0|4.0|This is really an easy buy; you get their 1st five albums(CDs) for a great price. My only complaint is that on \\"Far Beyond D\\" the tracking isnt correctly synchrinized from song to song; in other words, if you want to burn a compilation from these CDs, youll catch the last 2nd or two from the end of one song, before the beginning of the track youve selected. This is only the case on the FAR BEYOND cd however. This wont bother everyone, but Im somewhat of a perfectionist, and I dont have the proper editing systems on my PC at this time to \\"clean up\\" or polish out intros and exits...for this reason, I give this set a 4 star instead of 5...Its still an outstanding deal.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I don't. know if this fame should be callednOregon Trail but it really is quite fun.  anyone who is interested should give the game a try.
B007O3QC8K|4.0|My standard for modern recordings on this is Giulini/VPO. I also like Wand/NDR (both accounts, particularly Lubeck live). And Luisi/Dresden. (Hmmmm, seems I may like Italians conducting this Austrian monumentalist!) This comes oh so close to being great. It has its moments (you know them, when your spine tingles and the hair on your arms prickles). The sound quality is quite good, and Rattle, who I love in some rep and hate in others, is great here. This is FAR superior to his outing with the 4th Symphony. Having the fourth movement is nice, and does \\"resolve\\" it in a music theory sense. But my heart still says, \\"Ah, just follow up the great three movements with the Te Deum.\\" A noble effort here, though. For a newcomer to Bruckner with a hankering for modern sound, glorious Berlin playing, and a star conductor coming into his own with this monumental composer, this could be a top choice.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great for when you need to wait around fun way to pass the time highly recommend loses of fun for all
B0069EOZT8|5.0|I love Gunter Wand. Everything here is solidly \\"mainstream,\\" and I mean that as a compliment in this case. No bizarre interpretations, or willful treatment; very consistent treatment of all the classics. Wand has complete respect for the composers as well as the scores. The Beethoven here is a model of moderation in tempo. The same can be said for the Schubert, Bruckner, Brahms, and everything else here. Collectors will be bemoan the fact that some classic recordings which are hard to find are NOT here (I think mainly of the handful of live NDR Bruckner recordings made in Lubeck Cathedral, or the recent Berlin Philharmonic Bruckner recordings), but this is a great package, done well. The package itself deserves mention. This is done up LP style! Nice big, thick readable book, the size of an LP, filled with notes and interviews. All the CDs are in individual cardboard sleeves, arranged in four \\"slots\\" in a big, LP-sized box which is about 1.5 inches thick. Very nicely done, though some may wish for a bit more of a \\"standard\\" space-saving CD box format. Wand collectors probably have all this, but for someone new to classical music this could easily be a starter library for standard repertoire. This would make a beautiful gift, too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I use it all the time. I have it on my cell phone and on my Kindle. The Bible is always with me. I can chenge the Bible version to any one I need. I am so happy that I have the you version Bible.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! So glad it's finally FREE for Kindle Fire! Won't have to keep stealing my kids' iPods anymore. Thank you very much (is that 20 words?????)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I was sceptical since it was faotd, but after playing it I would have gladly payed for it. I highly recommend thus game.
0226039331|3.0|I wish I could say better things about this tome. It's good for the NT, I suppose, but its claim of coverage of 'early Christian literature' is not. In particular, it is near useless for Origen or Ignatius, containing few of their neologisms or hapax legomena. Basically, I use it to look up words I don't know, and it doesn't have the great bulk of them.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is one of the best puzzle games for an android app that they could have made. It really keeps your mind in the thinking mode. It has time going by really quick. You can caught up in the moment.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I've played a lot of video games, and forgotten a lot of them, but I won't forget these two, especially Shadow of the Colossus. SOTC and ICo are art in game form. It was a brilliant move to remaster them and put them on the PS3, and afford-ably as well!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Really fun, I like the way it's easy to play with one hand.<br />A lot easier than the work required with cards!
0385344325|5.0|This is the second 'Young Reacher' or 'MP Reacher' book, as I now call them, where we see one of Reacher's adventures when he was still a thirtysomething MP and not the fifty-ish drifter he is now. Some of the Reacher books (especially the early ones) have completely unbelievable plots, but this one is ok, and I especially like how it showcases Reacher's quick brutality.
B0086700CM|5.0|when I first saw this app on my friends Ipod I kept bugging my friend to play it and then I got my kindle so I got so some money and I looked in the amazon app store and it wasn't there so I found Apk files online so I downloaded them and I loved it but now that the real thing is on here I love it!!!!!!!! its free and fun to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :))

B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is a fun app but you have to watch what you do because it is complicated to disable purchases. but if you dont have enough money to buy something, a screen comes up that says &quot;oh darn!&quot; and will have an amount at the bottom and an accept button. if you click accept, you probably think that you are saying, &quot;okay i know i don't have enough money,&quot; but you are really saying that you want to buy the amount of money it showas at the bottom of the screen. it isn't  hard to control what you click though. it is a very fun app and i love to play it! if you are trying to decide whether to get it or not, get it!
B0086700CM|3.0|I was very excited when this came out on the kindle but when you play it and start to run faster and turn corners the screen gets all spastic and glitchy

B007BVOF8E|1.0|A recipe for quick profit: (1) Choose a worshipped film for a remake.  (2) Make big name actors an offer they can't refuse by emphasizing it's for just a few minutes of \\"winging it\\" on screen.  (3)  Rip through the story with abrupt cutting, huge disjunctures and perfunctory attention to core elements.  4) Capitalize on a lifetime's networking to call in a few favours from EMPIRE and similar rating mills to get 5-star ratings to splash around.  (5) Release reviews praising the film and predicting criticism will come only from special effects freaks hungry for James Bond razzle-dazzle & exploding oil tanks, and from nervous hopheads too \\"impatient\\" to watch a slow moving 5-star masterpiece.  6) Have studio hands and relatives bang away at the \\"not helpful\\" button on the 1 & 2 star Amazon Reviews.  (7)Then I'd review my bank account daily with the utmost satisfaction.  So much for my fantasy of what I'd do, generally speaking.<br /><br />Ooops, it looks like I've run out of time today, so I'll address myself to THIS film on some future occasion.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was a non-stop emotional rollercoaster and I loved it! A page turner that I couldn't put down and now that I have read it I'm kind of sad that it's over.
B007BVJZ0C|5.0|As stated I have never read the books so I cannot be drawn into the book vs TV show argument. This series is simple the best. It has all the qualities that any show could want. The only rant I have right now is not against the show or HBO but against Amazon. Does Amazon have any intentions of EVER getting season 2 on demand BEFORE season 3 has already started?!?!?!

0446547654|3.0|This is my second book written by Nicholas Sparks having read \\"The Wedding\\" previously.  I really was intrigued for most of the book and then....  Yeah, it follows his same formula of someone dies and a lost love.  Why is it that his books are so predictable?  Well, because they are.  This was a really great story until the last few chapters of the book so I admit that I really enjoyed it till then.  The characters were well developed and I felt compassion for their plot in life.  I just wish he would have chosen an entirely different ending and it would have made all the difference.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|This is an awesome little package for anyone who is obsessed with the Alien series. It's also a great way to get into the mythology and movies if you're a curious enthusiast as well. This actual Import edition is absolutely great, with all 6 discs that you'll find in the same US version but in a straightforward blue Blu-Ray case. It still has the same booklet to walk you through the contents on each disc and has all the same exact content as the higher-priced domestic package. Get this if you want to watch all 4 movies (and all the insightful extras and documentaries) in excellent quality and sound.
B004ZNANZA|5.0|Must have for all Wall enthusiast. To get it brand new fot $12 is a steal. Got it shipped in three days, too
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's fun and addicting. It's definitely the kind of game to play to keep you occupied for hours if you're the type to wanna waste time, or just looking for something to play.
B001DCQI8W|3.0|My first encounter these recordings was many years ago, when I damaged one of the CD's of a recording of the 8th symphony conducted by haitink. I bought karajan as a replacement. Karajan was a great musician who did almost everything well, including bruckner, but he offers no special insight into the music, failing especially to capitalize on bruckner's use of rhythm. while hunting for a complete set recently I spot-checked various recordings (via rhapsody) by karajan, and came away with the same conclusion. certainly well-played, and above all musical and not contrived, but not as insghtful as others. I did the same with an obscure set conducted by paternostro, leading \\"not the berlin philharmonic\\". I wound up buying the set. I am working through the recordings now, but would suggest a comparison so far of the handing of the scherzo of the symphony #4. berlin PLAYS better, but Wurttemberg under Paternostro offers a more substantial interpretation. still for those not seeking more from bruckner, Karajan could yet be the best choice. for myself, recordings by Haitink, and Gunter Wand, and some others (likely Paternostro), certainly are preferred.

B005LAIHMW|5.0|Several couples are in love and experiencing pregnancy for the first time, other couples are sharing their fertility issues, and some discuss adoption. But, as far as the Topics of discussion are concerned, there are Many. Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez play their roles well, and Chris Rock is extremely funny as he plays one of the Top Dudes. The cast of characters perform at their best and there are heartfelt moments as well as bundles of laughter. This movie, inspired by the Best-Selling pregnancy book is not only about the trials-and-tribulations of pregnancy, but also include many other issues to ponder and many viewers can relate, such as 9 months of waiting for the big day to come and how labor may feel. The guys are great at how to bond with your baby, and other baby issues. Highly recommended to romantic comedy lovers and for all those who wish to seek information from the pros who will share the famous saying, Been There And Done That! Overall, interesting and very funny, including the mood-swings!

0786956127|5.0|This is one of the most versaTILE (pun entirely intended) things that I have gotten as a DM.  The tiles can be used over and over in different combinations without seeming familiar.  There are a good variety of generic tiles that will not make a person think \\"Oh, I've seen that rock formation in the last encounter.\\"  However, there are also some unique tiles that give players a sense of importance when they see it.  With the right settings and plot, you could run an entire campaign with just this kit.  It should be noted, however, that this works great in conjunction with the other Master Sets (I personally use the dungeon set as well) to expand your settings.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app so much! I have it on all devices that can get it that i have! It iz amazing and fun! :)

B004PAHZMC|5.0|Bought this for my 4 year old Star Wars crazy grandson.  He just loved it.  His Mom loves it too because he can store his Star War Legos in it.  It folds open and looks like the inside of a space ship, so he uses it to play with too.  Grandpa scored again with this gift.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm am so happy this came out for kindle fire I'm am!! addicted to this game its so awesomeeeee!!!!!!!! its the best game ever made
B004R2DS9C|5.0|Bought this for my 6 year old grandson who loves Legos and Star Wars.  It gave him a great place to store his Star Wars Lego sets.  It can be unzipped and used as a play mat.  He uses this constantly.  His Mom loves it because it is a great way to help keep his room neat.
0345803507|5.0|All three books are VERY well written....great series for the first time writer....Maybe this should be a beach book to read during the summer!!  Enjoy your summer reading...
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I bought this collection for my husband. He really likes the quality. Yes, it is a little grainy, but that helps set the mood for the films. I noticed some people stated the bonus disc would not play. Our bonus disc does play in our Blu-ray player. The Blu-ray player is a cheapy from Walmart. All in all, we love this collection.
0345803493|5.0|Book two was good, couldn't want to read three...there is a story line in the writing.  It's not all S & M.  they only talked about the first book on the TV shows...didn't know there was 2 and 3 until I checked Amazon.  Good read..enjoy
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|DVDS should have Weird Ending Warning stickers on them. This film was Awesome at first, then just faded to Grey with a weird ending...
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I love the gameplay but am having trouble with frequent crashes to the startup screen.<br /><br />Also on the railway schedule I have input all the times on the clock to no avail, not sure if it's a bug?<br /><br />Using an ASUS Transformer TF101
B000AMJC2K|5.0|The price is OK. The arm looks very fashion and I do think it is stable to hold a heavy monitor.<br />Recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the most awesomest game there ever is. this is the best game ever I love it and you should too!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game if fun and keeps you coming back for more. the best I app I have downloaded thus far. a real treat
B005ZUR724|5.0|this is a great game for people that are looking for adventure totally worth the money this is by far my favorite kindle game
B004CLYKLI|5.0|OK. I read this from a different perspective. My predilection was coaching youth sports.<br /><br />So, I either learned or confirmed the following.<br /><br />The self-esteem focus is overrated and counter productive.<br />Fun is mastering a difficult skill.<br />Good repetitions with mentored feedback are essential to success.<br />If Bob Knight can't possibly coach your kid, your second choice should be Amy Chua.<br />Beware of orthodoxy, especially the secular strain.<br />This book is, yes, a memoir, but, too, a coach's handbook.<br />Woody Hayes is alive and well in the essence of Amy Chua.<br />Youth \\"travel\\" teams are to learning, as Obama is to political economy. If a good occurs, it is adventitious.<br />For the good of your progeny, choose depth in a single activity over breadth in many, at the earliest possible age.<br />The significant difference between John Wooden and Amy Chua is the decibel level.
B007IE4DTU|5.0|Movie: If you're already a fan, you'll love the movie and learn things you may not have known about George.  If you're a casual fan, you'll learn lots and come away with a new appreciation of George as a man and musician.  The documentary concentrates mainly on the Beatle years and the All Things Must Pass album with a noticeable absence of the Dark Horse years.  It does a nice job of showing George's many interests; music, comedy, film, car racing and spirituality and there are interviews from friends from each of those interests and many interviews from George himself.  There are also great interview contributions from Olivia and Dhani (wife and son).<br /><br />Book:  This is a condensed version of Olivia Harrison's wonderful picture book that is an expansion on the movie.  You'll recognize the longer version of many quotes used in the documentary.  Always fun to sit and look at pictures of (and by) George.<br /><br />CD:  A really nice collection of demos and early takes without all of the production around it.  Many of the cuts are just George and a guitar.  It's awesome.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome, love it. get it. great game if you played any facebook games. addictive. entertaining. its worth getting. you are missing out if you don't download this game. totally rocking on my kindle fire...
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I think this game is really cool. first of all, controls are easy, but the game is hard at times, second of all, great on kindle fire.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I was skeptic a post layne staley A&C album could deliver, but boy did it ever. On first listen, I came away liking 2 or 3 songs.  After a few times through though, this album really grew on me. Generally speaking the album is heavy.  Each song is very unique (a GOOD thing) and doesn't leave you with the feeling of deja vu as you move through each track.  \\"Check your brain\\", in itself, is a little too repetitive for my taste, but that's really nitpicking.  Buy the album.  It rocks.
0679890475|3.0|Gave this as a gift to my granddaughter who was 15 months old who immediately put it to the taste test:  it appears to taste as good as her other books!  I thought it might be an appropriate choice to envoke thoughts on Mother's Day....not so much.  Pictures are cute and it tastes as good as others books, so not a total loss!
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game! I am soooooo glad it is on the Kindle. I do not have a all touch screen phone and I have an old Ipod mano so I did not have another choice. All my friends play and enjoy this game and I am happy to join in the fun :D.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|loved this game it has kept me entertained lol reminds me of a game on facebook building and planting very recommend ...
B0086700CM|5.0|the game. is super awesome I almost beat the game the game is super cool I wish I was. in the game.the. game is coooooooooooooooooool.
B000HZEPAE|5.0|Team America: World Police is one of the funniest films ever made. Fact. I've probably seen it ten times or more.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved The girl with the dragon tattoo and The girl who played with fire was a lot of surprising, awesome  suspenseful reading so The girl who kicked the hornets nest was the final ending that I wish would of continued! I loved every single book and this has been one of the best novels I've had the pleasure of reading. I will read again!!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use it on my phone and Kindle Fire! All around very convenient and great app; would suggest to anyone.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was gifted to me. I had never heard of it & I would never pay $29.99 for an e-book. I didn't know what to expect. I read it without reading the Amazon reviews. I couldn't put it down except when reading something alarming. Then after my OH MY GOODNESS moment, I'd be right back reading it. I LOVED it. I felt for the characters...I learnt about a life style that I had no knowledge of. Since the book was written from Ana's view, it was nice at the end to heard Christian's view.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I received this product in perfect condition and there was more music in the deal than I bargained for. Two audio discs, plus a DVD. Almost 70 songs, good buy!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an awesome game. I reccomend it for everyone. it really keeps you guessing and builds up reflexes. very addicting!!!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  I thought the casting of Anne and Wentworth were perfect and that they played their parts beautifully.  You could truly feel the romantic tension felt between them in every scene.  The fact that this version doesn't follow the book exactly didn't bother me, that is until the end.  I agree with other reviewers that all the running at the end was weird.  I still loved the movie though.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I was surprised at how bright the light was. It really  lit up my dark room. The Color options are nice too. Thanks.
B00723NWJE|4.0|This album is something new and I like it.  I still really love her previous work and hope she will do more in that genre.  Her voice is still sultry and lyrics interesting.<br /><br />The CD package... eh.  I might put it in a jewel case.  Of course I'll keep the cover for the new case!  Norah has really turned into a beautiful woman.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This comment is for those who criticize this movie as being too graphic, horrible and a waste of film.<br /><br />I found the movie to be very interesting.  As for the violence, I've seen more graphic violence on the television shows CSI and Law & Order.<br /><br />One person stated that they purchased the movie and was upset about the graphic violent rape scenes.  Right on the front of the case it states that there are violent and graphic scenes and if you had read the synopsis you would have been forewarned.<br /><br />Also, I find it amusing that you want to watch movies that depict violence but you want storybook violence.<br /><br />I have news for you.  RAPE IS VIOLENT!! with or without any additional physical abuse.<br /><br />This a foreign film.  Europe does not sugarcoat or romanticize violence like American films.<br /><br />Fifty-two years ago Sophia Loren stared in a movie (Two Women) where a mother and teenage daughter were brutally raped by a group of soldiers.  The movie won an Oscar and was nominated in two other categories.<br />No one whined about it because back then if a movie offended a person they just didn't watch it.<br /><br />Now all the hypocrites trying to be politically correct want the studios to produce movies that depict violence unrealistically.<br /><br />I'm just saying.
B00402FGEE|5.0|Sad this show only lasted two seasons. I really enjoyed it. If the Stargate movie and Battlestar Galactic were combined, it would be this show. I tried to go back and watch the older shows to know the backstory but for the most part found them cheesy. I appreciate other people really liked them. However, to me this series looked much better and had better acting as a whole.<br />I think Battlestar just ending when this show came out and the deviation it had from the style of the older Stargate series were the reasons it had difficulty gaining enough popularity to keep it going. I also feel this is why, if people gave it a chance now that some time has passed, they might like it more.  I certainly did.<br />I hope they bring this show back or come out with another Stargate series sometime soon.
B0063GORYU|4.0|like this version but I'm use to my computer helping me out a bit automaticly when I get stuck for too long.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game will keep you hooked and its lots of fun. just like Mario brothers for nintendo. worth the download and incredibly addicting to the adventures.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I play lots of apps on my tablet and read alot about this Lost City and most was very good.  I have been trying for several days to do the VERY FIRST puzzle to open that WALL on the screen with the Lion.  CAN ANYONE HELP ME.  I have read hint and tried everything. I have the page for journal and the heart and the flint in bag.  Hey maybe there is a glitch or something with my version who knows.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is the best game in the whole world it is so additive ... I play this game 24/7 it is so additive
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played. ever since I got this game it is the only game I play!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I liked the first book. I think it was the anticipation, the nervous energy, the \\"oh hell what's gonna happen next?\\"<br /><br />The second book -<br /><br />I was so bored that I would force myself to read a chapter here and there. It's like when a television show lets the main characters be in a relationship. All the \\"will they or won't they?\\" excitement diminishes and all you're left with is a storyline that you suddenly realize is lacking in substance.<br /><br />Both main characters got on my nerves in the second book. I don't understand why every male who knows Ana wants to assault her. And while some people dislike the series because Christian is controlling, it occurs to me that Ana is controlling and hypocritical with him as well (e.g., she should have her friends, but he shouldn't keep his friends).<br /><br />The sexy parts of this book are dull. I skipped them in hopes of finding something interesting in the pages that followed. I won't go in to detail about the overuse of some images and phrases, such as Ana biting her lip, because other reviewers have already covered that quite well. But suffice to say, the repetition will have you rolling your eyes. For me, there's no point in reading the third book. I looked at some spoilers on the Internet, and it appears there's more of the same in number 3.<br /><br />And OMG SHE DIDN'T WEAR PANTIES! SO SCANDALOUS! Are you kidding me? Seriously? A big deal over nothing; that's how I felt with this book.
B0085157B8|1.0|I enjoyed the first. It was dumb, senseless fun. This feels like a straight to DVD sequel so I guess it makes sense that it was released worldwide video on demand instead of theaters. The scenes all feel rushed. You will notice several editing mistakes between scenes and none of them ever have a chance to take hold. The trailer really did show the best parts of the movie. I really did give this one a chance in hopes for another ridiculous gory hour and a half but it didn't do it for me. It isn't one of those so bad it's good movies either. It's just bad. Leaves you feeling nothing, frankly. Usually when watching horror movies like this you leave laughing or shaking your head at the craziness. The characters had no clever lines nor interesting subplots. The main character being the piranhas didn't even have much time to shine. Most of the shots were of a shadowy school of them in a muddy lake. Zero tension.<br /><br />Oh well. Watch it if you don't believe me.<br /><br />I would however wait for the HD or 3D version though. This streams in 480p.<br /><br />I assume they released VOD instead of theaters because someone released it would tank on the big screen. So good call there. At least this way people will pay out of sheer curiousity.<br /><br />This could have been great!
0345803485|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a very dear friend ... a lady friend! I was talking to her about the differences in the way men and women approach the subject of love. She told me that women want ROMANCE; I responded that men (usually) want SEX. As a male, I wanted to know what she meant by 'romance' and she recommended this book.<br />I read this book over a weekend which is HIGHLY unusual for me; since I usually don't read fiction. I believe this book would be called a 'page turner'. It reminds me of the first book I read (in my youth) that dealt with \\"forbidden subjects\\": D. H. Lawrence's \\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\". Perhaps I am not savy to what is \\"now\\", but this seems to be in the same vein as Lawrence's book though much more \\"contemporary\\".<br />Oh, this seems to me to be a romance novel! But, I am anxious to talk with my friend and other women I know about this story. (I also look forward to reading the other two part of the trilogy!) I may want to 'youthen' (as Merlin did) and seek romance again!!
0385534639|5.0|I can't really describe this book - other than to say this is one of the best books that I have read in the past year. I read about 5-8 books per month and this is one that I cannot forget. It is truly magical, almost dreamlike, like eating the perfect bite of cake with fluffy icing.. Erin Morgenstern - if you are reading this please, please write another book as wonderful as this.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Using on DROID RAZR. Works well. Great time killer. Seems like lots of levels to keep me busy for awhile.
B003QP4NPE|3.0|This was pretty good, but I am going to have to get with my son to fully comprehend this book. I'm not that computer literate. It really grabs you at the beginning. Some of my confusion is with the ending. But, when my son finishes it, I will get with him & see if he agrees with me about the ending or if it is just my lack of knowledge. If the author writes another book, I would read it.<br /><br />I discovered there is a sequel to this book called, \\"Freedom.\\" It finishes the story! After reading it Daemon made more sense.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I thought this game was a great idea! It's fun to play when your bored! I recommend go download this game!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is oddly addicting, and gives me an adrenalin rush quickly, which isn't easy to do with games.  the graphics are nice, its easy to play for even my six year old sister.  I love it, and reccomend it to literally just about anyone
B0086700CM|5.0|I only had played this game on my friends iphone, but it was so much fun I could not wait for it to come out! Glad it did!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its fun to see the people run C: its challenging too and those monky things are freeaky.
B005LAIHIQ|5.0|I am a fan of the original series from its first episode to its<br />last and I absolutely LOVED this movie! Although I appreciated<br />the subtle things that were brought in from the original series, I was<br />delighted & impressed with its freshness & originality, with the<br />superb cast and the beautiful way it was filmed.  I went into this movie<br />with absolutely no preconceived notions except to be entertained for a few<br />hours ... and entertained I was!  Kudos to everyone involved!  I hope<br />there is a sequel!

B007URVZJ6|5.0|By the time I had read ten verses I was hooked.  Hooked on a writing style that was crisp, precise and left me in no doubt that I was about to experience an adventure of a lifetime, and surprisingly, in a style of poetic verse that left me gasping at its inventiveness and clarity.  The continuous inclusion of poetic device in its many and various forms appealed to my lyrical side, albeit the precision and terseness of the verse took a little time to get used to, although ultimately, became addictive.  John, please write more adventures in graphic/narrative verse.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a very fun and addicting game . very simple and easy but a little laggy hopefully will update, but overall a great game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is much better than I thought it would be its awesome and for free its kind of worth it
B0052UZIFA|5.0|best game ever j want to play it every minute of every day plant vs zombies is you game I. you love killing things with plants wait iv never played it don't listen to a word I ssy
B007SGM084|5.0|Yes this book explores a very unmentionable sex style but let's face it - we are all interested in other peoples' odd lives. Many times I found myself peeking over my shoulder to make sure no one was able to read the explicit pages that I can't deny I enjoyed. Ha! I could not put the books down. Finished all three within two weeks. I felt like I was a part of Christian and Ana's daily life. Will definitely read it again and I suggest you read it too. E L James your \\"aim to please\\" was very successful!!

1466401885|5.0|Beautiful Disaster was a story that sucked me in from the beginning. The story was intense and never once became boring. Travis \\"Mad dog\\" Maddox and Abby \\"Pigeon\\" Abernathy. Travis and Abby have a very love/hate relationship that mirrors many real life relationships. But that's the beauty of this book. It works for the characters. And let's not forget they are characters. I laughed. I grinned. I giggled. I got mad. I got frustrated. I got teary eyed, and that's what makes a great book. Travis and Abby's relationship is exactly what the title says: a Beautiful Disaster. Come take a roller coaster of a ride and read this awesome book.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|I'd like to say first off that this movie is hugely underrated and misunderstood. Most of the more sophisticated messages will go over the viewers heads, but those who catch them might get a kick out of it.<br /><br />However, even if you don't understand the messages sent throughout the movie, I've little to no doubt that you'd pass it off as a pretty damn good movie anyways lol<br /><br />It've already watched it half a dozen times and I've yet to become bored with it. :)<br /><br />Also, the included scenes that weren't in the theatrical version are some of the best scenes in the movie in my opinion.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I read a lot of reviews before I read this book. I had decided not to read it since a lot of people said it was so horrible. But it kept popping up every time I looked for books on amazon. After reading fifty shades I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is exactly what the title says. Travis and Abby are a beautiful disaster. I couldn't put it down even when I wanted to shake Abby or slap Travis and tell him to grow up and stop being so dependent on Abby. Everything about this story works because both Abby and Travis are messed up.<br /><br />They both have their flaws but they love each other. It's love at first sight for each of them. They just happen to have a very weird relationship. Travis is a man whore who Abby should've had tested for every STD known to man kind and possibly new ones. But once he falls for Abby and starts to see her he doesn't notice anyone else. No one else exist for him but her.<br /><br />I like this book more than Fifty Shades of Grey because this was all wrapped up in one book. What didn't work for me was that no one mention to Travis to get help to control his anger and jealousy. Both Abby and Travis should seek help for their relationship. Travis is very violent but he's never violent towards Abby. Though there were a few times he might actually hit her. They argue like there's no tomorrow but are very cute when they are together.<br /><br />There were some typos which is why I gave it three stars and also because no one saw a problem with the way Travis was.<br /><br />America is Abby's bestfriend. She loves Abby and protects her. She's more like a sister to Abby than anything else. I liked their friendship and how they were.<br /><br />I really liked this book. I'm glad I decided to give it a chance. This isn't a young adult book. I recommend it to anyone over the age of 18.
B0086700CM|2.0|first off I always play a game for a while before i review not just because it is fun on other systems. Two on ky kindle It skips a lot even when I am sitting next to my connection or it might be that the game size is too big for the kindle. third it also deleted some of my coins when I went off the game for a while. and lastly the game has no objective it just keeps going on forever. the only upside I would give this game is that it is free. maybe if they fixed all the problems in this review then I would rate 4stars
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is an AWESOME game I am addicted to it. You all have to get this game andirons you don't you are missing out on alot.
1610454812|4.0|I recently listened to Fearless by author Eric Blehm for the christianaudio Reviewers Program [...]    What a fabulous book!  Author Eric Blehm did a fabulous job in the construction of the life story of Adam Brown, of Seal Team Six, who lost his life fighting for our freedom. Far from the typical plotline found in many books of like genre, the author takes the reader down roads and into areas that would not be expected in the life of one of America's great heroes. The message of the book is inspirational and exhilarating. It gives incredible hope for the seemingly lost cases in life.    Eric Blehm conveyed not only the human and natural side of this elite Navy seal but also walked one through the process that this man was engaged in while he shifting between interacting with his family,  and fulfilling his position as an elite fighter for our country. It is a book with a lot of heart and soul packed tightly into an emotional plotline.    Paul Michael, the narrator, did a great job.  His \\"rougher voice\\" seemed to add to the experience of listening to this book, and helped create the mental atmosphere of rugged and military terrain.    I was a little surprised to come across swearing and inappropriate language in this book, being that it is marketed in the Christian genre. The language is definitely not what one would expect out of a Christian book, and I believe nothing beneficial would have been lost if it would have been left out.    Overall, this is a mind-stretching and insightful book, the message of which is desperately needed today.
B0086700CM|5.0|a few months ago I couldn't find it in the app store then I looked on the amazon store and thought I found the game but it was just a cheat book.a few months later my cousin was listening to music on my kindle fire then my dad said I could istunt2 so I went to the app store to by it and I saw temple run. I was so excited that I ran around house telling everybody
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so happy this game is on kindle I 've been waiting since I got my kindle. When I got it I was like finally it is on my kindle!
B0086700CM|5.0|Oh happy day! Opened the app store and saw the app at the top of the free list. Maybe it's just me, but the game seems harder to play on my Kindle Fire than on my sister's iPhone. Still, that won't stop me from playing it!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great app. It works very well on my kindle fire. I have really enjoyed the different levels. I recommend this one to those who enjoy puzzles.
B0086700CM|4.0|this action packed action game oz quite thrilling. I enjoy it thoroughly, I do however dislike the pricing of some of the items in the store, I.e. the characters, but it still is an. amazing game.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|Your age does not matter. This Muppets movie is worth watching over and over again. An amazing feel-good story with plenty of fun and surprise appearances.

B004WDRT1Y|5.0|This 3D edition is worth buying for the movie intro alone. My girlfriend and I are kids at heart and purchased this for our home. Whenever people come over and want to watch 3D content, this is one of the things that we put on.

B000256TD0|5.0|This goes great with the rest of my BTTF collection! If you're a BTTF junkie like me, you need to get this.
B000NQPZUQ|3.0|When Arch Enemy started, they were a side project (according to Joel Mciver in Extreme Metal 2000- I may be wrong as pointed out) and they didn't have Angela Gossow.  I am really glad the first vocalist left, because he doesn't sound great at all.  You can tell the other musicians are good, but you can also tell that their focus is elsewhere, probably on their main projects at the time.  The album isn't bad, but its also not great.  If you're wondering at what all the hype is about Arch Enemy, purchase Wages of Sin or Anthems of Rebellion as these are the best work of the band, in my opinion that is.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This is a movie that you MUST see if you have not already watched it. The special effects are stellar and the entire movie is marvelous.
B0086700CM|5.0|its great.  I'm glad its finally for kindle fire.  and the graphics r just as good as on an apple device
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and its solo much better on my kindle fire because the screen is so big.I recommend this game for everyone.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is awesome. It was a good idea, so I compliment the person who came up with this cool game. (10 years old)
0345529057|5.0|beautiful books small in size but heavy as rocks you could kill someone with one of this books hehehe, i love very much<br />my books and now the only thing that i have to wonder is if i should read them now or wait for the season finale.<br /><br />amazon i salute you.
B005NC81JW|3.0|There are aspects of this app that I really like - I love the daily nutrition goals (you know, drink 8 glasses of water a day and three dairy and seven fruits...). This app has the best display for that that I've seen and there are a couple of other views like this that are really nice. Problem is that my first day wouldn't allow me to find most of the points I needed to find. I had to calculate for almost everything I ate. Wanted something with a restaurant search so got Ultimate Weight Watcher Diary. Is quite cool but I'm not sure if it'll be my final pick or not.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is simply addictive and I love it!!!!!  Wish I had more time to play. I had seen some one playing this on an iphone and was waiting for it to come to android and kindle. what a happy day for me to finaly get it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is awesome. It does not, however, calculate exponents. P.S. PLEASE NOTE THE USE OF PROPER GRAMMAR, SPELLING AND PUCTUATION THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great little logic game, works perfectly. Will be playing this a lot, pretty amazing for a free daily app from Amazon.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I tried really hard to like this book.  It just gave me the shudders on so many levels.  The erotic scenes were contrived and unrealistic, the writing was appalling (someone please explain to E L James the difference between brought and bought for starters), the drama was repetitive and relentless, and he was an insecure control freak.  The heroine spends most of her time wondering if he is angry or not, and he spends lots of his time sulking.  Oh, this is apart from when they are having buckets of uncontrolled multiple orgasms.<br />Boring, unimaginative, contrived, and did I say.... boring??
B0086700CM|5.0|ya! finnaly I can play temple run on my kindle fire! I luv temple run its soooooo AWESOME!!!! YAAAAAAA! get it NOW!
B0086700CM|4.0|The game is great, but the controls are a little scetchy. Somtimes when you want to turn it will make you jump. Overall it's great. If it weren't for the scetchy controls I would give it a 5 star.
B0086700CM|5.0|so excited for temple tin to come out for fire and so so happy it did graphics are great. and super awesome... FREE!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time. I have looked on here before but they never had the game. I'm super glad they have it on here. and I think if you like fun cool games you should get it.
B0086700CM|5.0|its addicting!!!! the game is fun and challenging enough to make you want to keep playing! A+ I love it! I hope to beat every level

B0028IDXDS|5.0|I ordered the Wubbanub Monkey for my expecting daughter-in-law.  She has decided my grandson's nickname is going to be \\"lil monkey\\".  I thought this would be a perfect little gift to add to my growing collection of gifts for my first grandbaby.  My daughter in law loves, loves, loves this monkey.  She said it was her favorite gift at her recent baby shower. Even though my grandson is not born yet, I am sure this pacifier will always be his favorite.
1585427683|5.0|very good book, easy to read and has applications to follow! would recommend this book to others to read, is a very straight forward book and it is broken up into shorter chapters so you can read little bits at a time.
B000001DWG|5.0|Mother Love Bone are a band that many consider to be one of the first grunge bands. They had a large influence on Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and obviously Temple of the Dog. If anyone is looking for a great hard rock record, DO NOT hesitate in buying this! This album is chocked full of funky, groovy, rockin' riffs. Along side the hard rockers are also powerful and sad ballads that will make almost anyone cry. It is a very starnge mix of music that is beautiful, groovy, and kick ass! Get it, you won't regret it!<br /><br />P.S. WE LOVE AND MISS YA ANDY! KEEP ON ROCKIN' LANDREW!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This its a very good app because it will keep you occupied for many hours. It feel s very rewarding to discover the hidden picture after working hard to solve the logic puzzle.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|All around this game received one star reviews for glitches...and it has plenty as other reviewers have stated. What I found a little too &quot;coincidental&quot; is that on May 29th this game magically received a long line of happy customers with all 5 star reviews. I have zero respect for an application that has friends and/or co-workers do this for the sole purpose of increasing the games overall star review. And to be so blatantly obvious about it is insulting. That energy would be better spent in fixing the game glitches, no? Instead of trying to increase ratings for a game that has some major issues... have some integrity Gameloft. I am still shaking my head in wonder that you would resort to such tactics. And yes, it really is that obvious and not the first time I've seen this tactic used. Even if you do fix the game, the chances of me giving it another try is now low-as low as using fake reviews to up your ratings...
B0086700CM|5.0|I have only had this game for a day and I can't stop playing. It rocks! I even got my husband to play which was a mistake because now we fight over it.
B0086700CM|5.0|ok this game is the best. I love running away from monkeys....... don't ask why. ever since I first played this game I was like wow I'm really running from monkeys...... sorry for my Blondel thinking (I am a Blonde.......sorry) temple run is really fun. and I rate this FIVE STARS UP!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0525478817|3.0|It seems like every less-than-five-star review needs to begin with the author's assurance of being a Nerdfighter and loving John Green, lest it be downvoted into oblivion. Therefore let me begin by saying that yes, I am a Nerdfighter, and I watch John Green videos religiously. However, TFIOS fell a little flat for me. Most points I want to make have already been addressed, but I still wanted to stand with my fellow three-star-ers.<br /><br />My main problem with the book is that the characters are just not believable. They do not speak like teenagers. They do not even handle situations like teenagers do. So many interactions between Gus and Hazel are interactions which, plain and simple, just would not happen between real, emotional, scared, awkward, virgin teenagers, let alone ones with cancer who have been socially cut off for much of their lives. Their transactions are so smooth and painless with just the barest occasional tinge of awkwardness, when most of them ought to be drenched. Augustus's flirting comes to mind as a prime example. It is funny and witty and entertaining and it is also the flirting of an experienced 25 year old. Neither character appears to be a three-dimensional relatable teenager, and that's a shame, because creating a believable teenage romance is what Green is trying to do.<br /><br />Neither Hazel, Augustus, Hazel's mom, or Hazel's dad appear to have their own seperate identity. They all have the same voice and thought pattern and high intelligence level as their creator does. Hazel is John Green. Augustus is John Green. Hazel's mom and dad are John Green. Isaac is John Green. (Now, I know that obviously all of an author's characters are going to reflect bits of themselves, but it shouldn't be so obvious.) Fortunately, even though all the characters are the same person, the person they are is an interesting person, which is why it's still a good book. Just not the OMGOMGBESTBOOKEVER book that the 600+ 5-star reviews imply.<br /><br />So,conclusion: I like John Green, I like what he brings to the arena of young adult novels. I like that he expects us to already know his references to The Great Gatsby and Kurt Vonnegut. I like that he challenges us. I like that he creates an environment within and without his novels which expects teenagers to be intelligent and demands them to be intelligent and teaches them to be intelligent. I like the fun little jokes and joyful geekery and the great thought-provoking quotes about life. But because the characters were so unbeleivable, I didn't \\"feel\\" any of them and I didn't care about them, because Green's own voice drowned theirs out.<br /><br />So that is my review of TFIOS. Not bad, not amazing either. Better than 80% of the YA novels being published right now, I'm glad that someone with talent gets to be a bestseller. But he still didn't hit it out of the park.<br /><br />p.s. Thumbs-downers, it is not very much in the spirit of Nerdfighteria to thumbs-down a well-written review just for disagreeing with you. This does add to the discussion and you know it. Stop forgetting to be awesome. Everyone else, DFTBA.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Edit: Two years and 58 comments later, I'm editing this to address the most common refrain of my most vocal critics, which is that Augustus/Hazel are \\"smart\\" and that I need to \\"stop suggesting that teenagers aren't supposed to talk like that.\\" Yeah, I have a Tumblr too. You can stop sending me links that I've already seen.<br /><br />Here's the thing. The problem is not that Augustus is pretentious in the beginning and that his character arc makes him become less pretentious and therefore it's intentional and okay. The problem is that the entirety of the book, from start to finish, character to character, uses overinflated, pretentious diction, regardless of who is speaking. We as readers are expected to swallow this with the excuse of \\"stop telling teenagers how smart they can be\\", and any criticism is easily silenced by accusing the speaker (i.e. me) of insulting teenagers.<br /><br />In no circumstance did I say that teenagers are not intelligent. When I wrote this review, I was one, and I certainly did not underestimate the intelligence of my peers. The problem is that indicating that your characters are intelligent by giving them all the voice of a 30-year-old Yale English Lit major who is trying to impress a date is not great writing. It is (brace yourselves) mediocre writing that tramples and ignores and substitutes any genuine character voices with your own. As I said, it's not a bad book. It's engaging and well-written. But this is a major flaw, because the entire point of being an author is to emulate the voice of the people you are trying to portray. The romanticized, elitist diction used in Green's work is the whole \\"date a girl who reads\\" pretension in book form. The book is cluttered with these long, meandering introspective poem-paragraphs (not just when Augutus is speaking!) and while it is the exact reason teenagers (and adults) love it, it's also very frustrating for people who read to really connect with the characters/plot.<br /><br />Yeah, Hazel and Augustus are smart kids, and they've been through a lot, and they've had to grow up fast. But they've also been cut off from their peers, they are isolated in most social situations (see: airport scene), and generally \\"othered\\" by society because of their diseases. This kind of socialization would have a negative, not a positive, impact on a real human being's ability to interact with others. And while they are both \\"smart\\", smart doesn't necessarily mean re: speaking like a Yale lit major.<br /><br />I really believe that while it's a good book, it's not the best book ever; it receives a healthy popularity boost from John Green's very public profile, and if he were not such a well-known pseudo-celebrity, people would read his books a little more critically.000 positive reviews; when I wrote this it had 600. TFIOS and Green have become so overwhelmingly popular in recent years that his work is no longer reaching a small niche audience, it has become mainstream and popular even among non-nerdfighter readers. The movie will likely make it only more popular. Tl;dr: usually I wouldn't be this critical of an author, but I feel like the monolith of his perfection needs to be critiqued and challenged just as any other popular work of media is, and I stand by my 19-year-old self's assessment still.<br /><br />Okay?<br />Okay.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game  the baest game eber i was waiting forever for this to out and i am so happythat it came out.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game!! i play it all of the time! It is not a waste of time to get this app it is worth it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|WELL, I am a PhD candidate and I stumbled upon this book looking at others in the kindle library.  One could call me prudish on many levels. I rarely watch television except for Young & the Restless and a new show called Scandalous (losing that prudish vibe).  I truly love HGTV as well.  However, finding this book was cathartic for me since I do not have half of a lovelife as these two. It really was quite a ride reading this trilogy.  Expect the unexpected.  I believe the first book was misleading since it gave the impression everything about their lives was based on being a dominant or a submissive.  Wrong.  The book was telling in so many other ways.  I found it quite refreshing and enjoyable reading about the raw sex, romance, and the dark versus light enigma. After I finished the last book, I wondered about my own romantic life. I am hopeful to read additional books on Christian and Anastasia Grey. Are you listening author James?
B0086700CM|1.0|This game is quite enjoyable. My offspring also enjoy playing it on my cellular device. My partner also enjoys.playing this game on her Ipad and Ipod.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this game. It is the best out there by far. Love it and bye
B0086700CM|5.0|I can play this game all day!!!!!!!!! It is very fun. I always tell other people too get the game on there phone or anyhting like that.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was, hands down, my favorite that I've read in at least a year (and was the favorite of most members of our book club too.) It's beautifully written and emotionally wrenching. The main character will tear your heart out, but you'll root for her every step of the way, even when you don't fully understand or agree with her actions. The themes of forgiveness and redemption and the power of love ring true in a way that's exceedingly rare. I've already read this twice, and know it will join a handful of books that I love so much that I'll continue to read periodically the rest of my life.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Let's get started, shall we?<br /><br />Raven's Shadow is an incredible book. But I shouldn't need to tell you that. No one will be refuting the greatness of this particular story, which can be seen in the other reviewers statements. Therefore, I won't go largely in depth about what was so epic about this EPIC book, because others have done that for me.<br /><br />However, I do have one thing to add that might be of import. Anthony is a very talented fellow, not only because he can create a book of these proportions that hooks and holds readers for such an extended period. No, his most redeeming quality as an author is his ability for realism. We don't have half painted pictures of villains, trusted companions that would do anything for their hero. Instead, we have a set of flawed characters with an array of differing skills and abilities. They aren't always happy go lucky, they don't always win the war (and sometimes that war's purpose is grungy and sullied). The hero doesn't always get the girl of his dreams, the trusted companions aren't truly to be trusted in some cases. Our main character has his own flaws, strengths, weaknesses, but they are more profound and realized than in any novel I've encountered in my prolific readings. The king and related dignitaries are painted as baddies, but they can't truly be hated.<br /><br />One last thing, before I go. If you have any interest in the realm of fantasy, or even if you don't, you need to read this book. I'll be recommending this piece for years to come, I predict. It is one of the best works of fiction I've come across (and I only read fiction). I'm an aspiring author myself (although my training wheels are just beginning to come off as I pass the threshold of 250,000 words), and although there are a very, very small amount of errors evident (considering the massive word count), I doubt casual readers will even see them, or be bothered by them if they do.<br /><br />Buy this book. For the price its at and the glowing reviews it can brandish (despite its youth), you'd be crazy not to.<br /><br />- Derekwing reviews it can brandish (despite its youth), you'd be crazy not to.<br /><br />- Derek
B004GYY714|5.0|this app is the best app ever if you cant download any music on your kindle fire. get this app it is woo good and you would love it woo much!!!!!!!!!!  :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I went to see the free app of the day and I saw temple run and I said to myself yes!!!!!because I love temple run you have to get it
B0060FXDCG|1.0|Movies were boot leg. The movie box they came in was the best thing about it. It could have atleast described it was going to be that way before I paid my money.
B003UMW66G|4.0|Like title says, it's a Canadian disc but that just means it says \\"Her&oacute;s\\" in smaller letters in some spots.  Takes a bit longer to load on my USA NTSC Panasonic Blu-ray player, but it warns you of that.  After the initial load, the rest plays fine, no pauses in scene transitions.  Transfer is pretty good for a film that's over 10 years old.  Trust me, this film is worth Blu-ray.  If you've never seen it, the color schemes are just brilliant and look beyond beautiful in enhanced quality.  Shipping took about a day or 2 extra but for $8 and change, I can't complain.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a very interesting game and let me say that I would recommend it to daring escape fans .z
0547258305|4.0|I picked this book up in my never-ending quest to wean my granddaughters from sparkly vampires.  This may do it -- and even if it doesn't, it will expose them to decent writing, strong female characters who think and act, maybe not always correctly, but at least in a strong, decisive manner.  It will expose them to the notion that it's okay to be physically active, to learn things outside your comfort range.  It will help them see that a good relationship may involve risks, but you shouldn't have to do things that make you feel uncomfortable.<br /><br />Nice debut novel, interesting world setting, with nice constructs.  The concept of Gracelings, people who have the gift extraordinary abilities to do certain things, is an interesting one, especially in our world of superheros and stars.  All in all, I'm well pleased, and will seek out the next book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am soo happy that they finally got this game for kindle fire. I have been waiting for a long time. trust me people,  this game is awesome.
B0086700CM|5.0|the graphics on this app is absolutely amazing great to finally see temple run on the kindle fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! amazing game sweet

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read all three books in a week! I wish their story did not have to end. I was so captivated with everything about Christian and Ana.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun! I like the objectives because they give the game a real meaning instead of running in circles.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not put the Fifty Shades books down. I absolutely was captivated by them. The unconditional love Christian and Ana have for one another is priceless.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I saw the first season on HBO, but was almost turned off by the graphic nature of the production..so, I thought to read the source literature..In a word, FABULOUS!<br />This book, and the subsequent parts 2-4,brougfht Westeros to life. The only good thing I can say about the HBO version, is that I now have voices and images to help with the reading.<br />I will be picking up the fifth installment when finances allow.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|We were reading for book club. Enjoyed so much we read the trilogy. I have recmensed this book to just about everyone I know. Loved these books!!!
B00845MRKE|5.0|In my not so humble opinion, this film made by the master director Sir Ridley Scott, is the most perfect piece of cinema ever put together. Every aspect of the production brought their A+++ game. From set design, to costumes, to lighting, to model work and special effects, to the acting, to the score, to the direction... perfection. Even thirty years later it remains an undated masterpiece. My all time favorite film. And I have a lot of favorite films. In the Final Cut of Blade Runner Ridley fixed the only shot that took me out of the amazing experience, a dove flying up towards a bright blue sky, intercut in the middle of a pouring rain at nighttime end scene. Problem fixed = Perfect film. Perfect I says.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this ap. It's fun and easy to use. plus if you dislike one game there are 122 others you can play!
B0081SRJSY|5.0|It's so great to finally have one of the best board game apps on the Kindle; Carcassonne is absolutely addictive, relaxing, engaging and beautiful to look at. This is a major release--please, let's have more quality board game apps like this and Settlers of Catan (already on Android), Ticket to Ride, Forbidden Island, Puerto Rico (all on iOS). So many great board games crying out for Kindle Fire...
B007JM4CWY|5.0|if you enjoy suduko or crossword puzzles you will enjoy this japanese game.  my whole family enjoys playing. can be very addictive!
B002ZNJW0O|4.0|As the seventh anticipated movie inspired by the Nicholas Sparks' novel, The Lucky One, hit cinemas around the country the adaption swooned it's way into the hearts of all romance loving bookworm's and hormonal teenage girl's as both proceeded to the nearest bookstore to pick up their copy of the story. I'll be the first to admit that as an avid lover of action packed-mystery-bone chilling thrillers, something inside me began to warm up to the admirable and sigh-worthy love story between sultry and perfectly-rugged ex-marine Logan Thibault and young, quirky, single-mother Elizabeth Clayton, as Logan takes the journey across the country to search for the woman in the picture who saved his life and kept him out of harms way throughout the war. Time and time again Sparks' endows readers with the same plot formula; however, time and time again he takes readers on a journey through the struggles and passions of love that all readers will be left dreaming about hours if not days after they flip the final page closed. The Lucky One allows readers to be swept away into a world where every nerve in one's body is ignited all because of that one thing we all fantasize about: love.<br /> This novel about the triumphs of life is an overall easy and flowing read which allows all types of reader-personalities to jump into this book and become immersed in it's story. As themes of fate, love, and death are explored audiences of this work will be taken over by Sparks' poetic language and a story which connects us all, and makes us feel worthy of experiencing the hardships of sacrifice, life, and true love.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it's angry birds for free.  auto updates. endless hours of fun launching birds at pigs. nothing like a fun physics lesson!
0439023491|3.0|Catching fire is an absolutely great read, however, it was really too much of a mirror image of the original. Hence, I would be hypocritical to proclaim my love for 'The Hunger Games', and not for Catching Fire. By mirror image, my focus is on the plot and physical environments. The pace on the other hand assisted in my reading.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|it's angry birds w/ a twist.  no pigs here.  free the caged birds & kill some monkeys in the process. auto updates. fun physics game.
0439023513|5.0|Totally unexpected conclusion of the series. Although I am not one to uphold violence of anykind, admittedly, the 'M-O' of Suzanne Collins presentation of Katniss's violent obsession, is an extraodinary rare occasion, when our fantasy can escape into a world where the revenge is worth the violence, or is it the violence is worth the revenge......
B004VMUS9G|4.0|easy to set & personalize. multi-functions & settings. great alarm for being on the road or just needing a reminder.
0345803485|5.0|Let me begin by saying I'm not a big reader.. especially romance novels. But I absolutely LOVED this series! I know people keep saying this is poorly written and un-realistic but you have to remember, its a fiction novel and its from Ana's point of view, a 22 year old. Yes there are sex scenes but ultimately this is a sweet love story.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|my daughter enjoys playing the many modes of this game.  easy to personalize & customize.  multi game options. hours of fun.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|One of the best shows currently on TV. The costumes and sets are well done and really makes the setting look like a real place. Acting isn't cheesy and overall a good production.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|angry birds for free.  auto updates. kill the pigs just like the original game but enjoy the festive backgrounds. whole family can enjoy.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Once again after finishing one of Ken Follet's books I found myself annoyed that it was over, and extremely impatient to get hold of the next book in the trilogy ... only to discover that I will have to wait until fall 2012.  His characters take us through Europe during the time before and during 1st World War, and via the characters and their lives you learn more about WW1 than you did from history lessons at school. Great reading. Hurry up, please, Mr. Follett: We are waiting impatiently for the next book in the trilogy :o)
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|what is there to say... it is adobe reader just like on a pc.  nice thing about the app is it auto-updates without asking to update atleast once a week.
B0086700CM|5.0|All of my friends had this game on there tones or ipod touches. I am so happy I got this game. Now I can beat Danny!!!!! wooooooo

B0063GORYU|5.0|A step up from basic solitaire. Challenging. You need to start with one suit to get the hang of it. Worth a try.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|There's nothing less than one star or I would have given it that rating. I blame myself for breaking my own cardinal rule: don't buy a trilogy unless you read the first book first. I admit that the movie trailer had me believing that no one would drop big bucks on buying movie rights unless the books were excellent. Big mistake. The premise of the books: in the deep dark future the country of Panem is a brutal dictatorship with its 12 remaining \\"districts\\" living under slave rule to provide the Capitol with everything they need or want to live large. Katniss, a 16 year old girl who has lived in district 12 her whole life, who has seen brutal killings, has had to hunt in the wild to provide for her family, etc volunteers to take the place of her younger sister who has been selected to fight in the yearly Hunger Games, an event designed to keep the slave populace aware of what happens to people who revolt against the government. Katniss enters the game with a boy she'd known her entire life but didn't suspect his love for her. They enter the games and its Last Man Standing rules. Brutal death, hunger, dangers around every corner. What is Katniss' prime concern? Is it getting killed, leaving her sister and mother to die of starvation? Is it the dread of a knife or spear penetrating her, killing her? Nope, her prime concern is whether or not Peeta, the boy she's with, REALLY REALLY REALLY loves her. Prime dialogue:  Peeta loves me, or DOES he? I love him too, or DO I? And my hunting partner/boyfriend back home, he loves me too. Or DOES he, and I want him, or DO I? Jesus Mary and Joseph. My 15 year old granddaughter could have written a better book. This is a book about a chick written by a chick. The author is trying to describe life in a futuristic concentration camp but writes about the girl's maturity level as if it were 2012 in San Francisco. If this book had been written in a less sophmoric manner, Katniss wouldn't have even thought about anyone's feelings or any misunderstandings between her and her boyfriends, she would have been a hardened, mature girl at age 16 who had liven in conditions similar to girls and boys in modern age countries like Somalia and Yemen. She wouldn't have even considered little silly girl concerns such as IF some boy loved her, she would have been in the games to win and live, period. I'm forced to finish the trilogy just because I  paid for them, but I'm finding myself skipping pages by the dozens, sick and tired of the immature and outlandishly inappropriate dialogue that goes on and on and on about her little \\"feelings\\". Don't buy this joke of a trilogy, just go see the movie and hopefully it won't be as bad as the books.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|The glu points you earn in game and out of game I never Received. I tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling it still never received them. I at least get my silver coins but never the gold ones. You know when I install other games like it says for certain point I don't always get them either. I don't know if it is because I run CM7 OS or not. I doubt it is because of that. So I don't run anymore these games from this company.
B0086700CM|5.0|if it wasn't 1am, and if I were home alone I would have screamed when I saw that they finally put Temple Run in the store!!! instead I did one of those whisper screams... anyway, you understand my excitement.<br />I first heard about this game on YouTube from Toby Turner aka tobuscus, and I immediately got the app on my iPod touch. I haven't been playing it recently though because ive been addicted to my kindle fire so I've been waiting paitiently for this.... and here it is!!<br />still waiting for it to download though haha :)
B003UBTX72|5.0|Excellent book!  Very well written, thoughtful and gives one a great insight of Keith Richards and the band.<br />This is not your usual \\"sorrid\\" book of sex and groupies, very little is discussed relative to that.  This is a much<br />more in-depth chronicle of his life and the Rolling Stones. This book reads well and is well written and great story<br />of his life.
B0086700CM|2.0|Is it just me or is it impossible to control the moves trying to be made. It looks like a would be fun game if I could only have more control:(
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a good game. it keeps you busy and interested. it is easy to get coins that open up additional games. you get coins for trying a game like 6 times in a row. the Romeo game that you can unlock is hilarious.
0345803485|1.0|I had 20 friends tell me I have to read this, so glad I didn't buy all 3. Like the character Anna, I love all the same writers, 17 th, 18th century English writers. Classics, Bronte' , Dumas. Love mysteries too. But this is just crap. Girl with dragon tattoo books were great. This is plain and simple trashy unimaginative crap. Read something good people.  If I could I would give it a B for boring.  But no stars
1455508969|5.0|I want to see the movie so I stuck to it, even though it didn't pull me in right away. After a while I was hooked and finished the book in just a few days! Sparks kept reeling me in (tugging at my heart) and I found myself crying, \\"noooooooooooo!\\" but read for yourself!!!!!<br /><br />P.S. I want Zeus!
B0086700CM|4.0|I can play this game for hours and hours on end. very intriguing . I was really glad they made a kindle fire edition. sometimes, like anything else, it glitches.
0061537969|4.0|Adorable! Must read! The metaphors got on my nerves just a tad, but it was worth while in the end.
8862931921|5.0|This is an excellent find:    1.  Construction:  It is hard-bound and well-constructed.    2.  Size:  If smaller sized notebooks feels claustrophobic, then A4 size should do.  A backpack or a briefcase can easily accommodate this notebook.    3.  Paper:  Accepts fountain pen pretty well with almost no bleeding.  A minor note:  The paper has a slightly creamy color, which is easier on the eyes than the bleach white found in most printer papers.    Update 01/06/2015, after several years of use:    I need to be more specific about 'no bleeding.' In the snapshot I have posted, I used Noodler's Black Eel ink, which has somewhat oily texture than most other fountain pen inks. If I use the Black Eel's to predominantly scribble and doodle with medium to light pressure, then there is minimal bleeding. On the other hand, there would be considerable more bleeding if I were using something like Pilot Iroshizuku ink, which is more fluid. However, the Black Eel that I have been using on Moleskine has one problem in that after a while, some of the black ink makes dry ink marks onto the preceding page.    As a precautionary measure, if you are using Moleskine (or other notebooks in general) predominantly to write and to draw something that you want to last, use every other pages. (For example, page 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on.)
0061969656|4.0|I gave this book as a gift to my son who has read many books by Cornwell He says he enjoyed reading it.
0307592731|5.0|Yes, another memoir -- beautifully written against a glorious landscape. Cheryl takes a hike to find herself. Her demons are not my demons. Her generation is not my generation. Yet, somehow as she related the tale of her hike, I was pushed inward to examine my own journey. This, I believe is the mark of a worthwhile memoir. Not just the lamentation of a life lived less than well, but the experience of transcending all of that historical rubbish. The specifics are not important -- it is the arc over all that went before that moved me. I loved my walk with Cheryl.
B007JWKLMO|3.0|The description says it's \\"standard\\" aspect ratio for the DVD.  Is this true?  The Blu-Ray says widescreen.  Help me out here.  Thanks.
B0086700CM|3.0|I am glad Temple Run is finally here. But there are a few problems with it. one it glitches up. two it eats up hour battery.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Oh, how the mighty have fallen.  It must be the name George.  First Lucas, and now Martin.  Here we have another George that has lost his once wonderful story telling ability.<br /><br />Let me be clear.  I LOVED the first three books in this series... I even liked \\"Feast\\" although I was getting concerned with the choppy flow, direction, and lack of any thread conclusions.<br /><br />With \\"Dance\\" I wanted to quit reading a quarter of the way through.  The only thing that kept me going was the hope (from my love for the series) that there would be some light at the end of the tunnel that would redeem it, but it never came.  This was 1,000+ page book with little to no story progression at all, and with many chapters devoted to new or obscure characters that added nothing to the overall arch in my opinion.  It read like a collection of short stories.<br /><br />Characters I always enjoyed like Daenerys and Jon Snow were just uninteresting shadows of themselves. There were some individual chapters I enjoyed (thus 2 stars instead of 1), particularly the ones devoted to Tyrion who still manages to make me laugh out loud, but all in all, it just wasn't enough to glue this hot mess together into something enjoyable.<br /><br />I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I just can't comprehend how 416 people gave this a 5 star review.  Maybe there was an extended cut that I missed which actually told a story.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is great. please if you looking for a good awesome game, buy it now . you will never be sorry!
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Best music she has ever composed!!  Great price for the collection. I would definitly recommend this to anyone who likes classic rock from the 60/70's. Fantastic!

B0086700CM|5.0|I like this game a lot but its very sensative qnd it lags a lot try and tix it please. :)
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I used to be addicted with this game until they made changes!!  To catch I would close the doors so I can have a lot if food available--that way I would have more than enough.. after the changes with the doors closed my food is disappearing!! its not fun anymore I feel like I'm constantly rushing to catch up!! I'm about to delete it if the changes aren't change asap!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it! At first it was extremely challenging for me, but the more you play the better you get! &lt;3&lt;3
B0049UHKVY|5.0|I simply love this album. Tommy Karevik's singing is amazing, and the songs 'change' so much. With most metal, you know how the song is going to be pretty much as soon as you're a minute into it. With Seventh Wonder, it feels as though you're going through tunnels, emerging into sunlight, and plunging into the depths of the earth. Everything from the timing to the tone change on a minute by minute basis. So much variation, so much story, you kind of have to sit back and savor it. I'm usually into bands I can listen to in the background and let them help me work on problems during the workday, but this kind of music, of which Seventh Wonder is the only example I've heard, is meant as a foreground story, something you devote all your attention to.<br /><br />The imagery in the music is amazing. I don't just mean the words - the music itself will show you what it is about. If you played the title song, The Great Escape, from 5:00 to 5:12, I'm pretty sure a random listener would tell you it was about space, knowing nothing else about the music.<br /><br />I don't usually gush, but this is a work of art. Buy it.<br /><br />(Does anyone else have examples of \\"journey metal\\" / \\"story metal\\" similar to this? I'd love to give it a listen. Please leave a comment.)
0307474712|5.0|An enchanting and well written book. David Nicholls has a wonderful way of describing the intricacies and subtleties of his characters, which evolve with quick, and energetic style. Love the contrast between Emma and Dexter, and the lovely chemistry they share. Truly a love story of the great kind.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i lov this game soooo much the only thing is that there is'nt enough room 4 my pirannah home and i only have 4 acorns!! :-(<br />  -Scrat lover 101
B004SUWR2C|2.0|its making me download this weird thing and it wont download! This is a good app (I think) if your willing to wait.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is an amazing fun filled game that challenges you to win and defeat that game earning more points so you can buy another mind challenging game
B0086700CM|5.0|well first of all the game is pretty good but some of the times I get the boost and it makes me fall into a hole and when ever u get to the red coins they should all be red. or when there blue they should all be blue
B00785P2QC|3.0|very fun and easy to play very addicting though good graphics to and free who doesn't like free games worth your time
B007SYWFRM|4.0|well breeding the animals is I think kinda expensive.  and the one mini game on this app is 5 acorns per game  and ... yeah its just kinda expensive but other wise, a really fun game
B003WE9WRI|5.0|What can I say: it's just \\"must have\\" for all zombie fans.<br /><br />What I like about this book?<br />It's coherent vision - exactly explains what are \\"zombies\\", how they are created and how to get rid of them.<br /><br />If you like good zombie stories - read this book, you won't be disappointed<br /><br />If you think about writing \\"zombie novel\\" - read this book first. You will see how good fiction should bee constructed.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I ordered Adele 19 after hearing her on some awards show and really enjoyed the quirky style and lyrics and of coarse her amazing voice. When I hear the song Rumor Has It from this album I fell in love with the rhythm and the power of the song which was very different from her previous work so I thought I take a chance and buy this CD too.<br /><br />It was totally worth it. Well, recorded, which really matters to me. The entire album is a collection of great tunes, clever and interesting music as well as lyrics tied together with Adele's amazing voice.<br /><br />Some CD's I buy and like but listen to them as background music. Adele 21 holds my attention and my imagination. I love to play it on the way home from work, somehow I get lost in the music and forget about work and the day. I find myself getting home wishing the drive was a little longer so I can hear more of the CD!<br /><br />Take a chance, buy the CD, there are a number of hits on it already, I think there could be more if they release them to Radio or XM.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It has to be one of the funnesr games ever and I just can't stop playing it. One of my favorate apps.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ok so the story line of the book about a girl loving a man with a troubled past & his way of coping with it is pretty decent but other than that there are things that need some work. The reptiton of things like her biting her lip or her cheeks flushing or his eyes burning & his lips presses into a hard line got to be a bit annoying. This book seems to have a very narrow vocabulary. There was also so much erotica that eventually it got old numbing & just plain annoying. The characters were creative. I didn't like the ending at all it was very upsetting & it makes you have to read the next book. All things aside I did like this book more than I thought i would but I don't plan on reading it again. For me once was enough. Bmsd  books aren't really my thing so I think I might stick to my Nicholas sparks books.
B0085157B8|2.0|Lacking the serousness and realism the first one had. Too many female cliches' that the real world just doesn't tolerate. For example: No. 1 Do you think ashley who is (a hot slutty black chick with big boobies and is my BBF whom steals all my boyfriends) is hotter than me (a skinny, boobless bleach blonde with the brain of a empty peanut shell) and by the way I'm a virgin with issues. \\"I'm hot, right?\\" First of all ladies the answer will always be Yes, she is hotter than you. Even when we say no, she is not. No. 2 The deputy sheriff (not sheriff and no sheriff appears for some unknown reason)is a 16 year old pretty boy whom couldn't convince us of his adulthood even if he had a mustache as thick as Eugene Levy's eyebrows. And No. 3 Gary Busey is in it. And surprisingly the most believable performance. The second being ha ha ha The Hoff. I went in to this expecting less then zero and still felt like I lost something to this movie aside from the $7 and 84 mins. This movie had no \\"grown ups\\" what so ever. The boobs weren't all that great, just flashy. So much potential that was ruined by the director and The Weinstien's. All though I will end this on a happy note. I hope they make a third, but with a better and more chaotically controlled director who isn't out to make a cartoon.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been playing on an iPhone and needed a bigger screen thank goodness they let it out on Amazon! I have been waiting two months!!! Thanks Amazon!!!

0345803485|5.0|A book you can't put down.  Can't wait to start on the second one!  It sure gives you a different perspective on sex!
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game!! Play it all the time and it hasn't gotten old yet.  Best game I've gotten since my wife gave me my Kindle Fire for Christmas!! Recommend it highly to anyone who likes action games!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I didn't realize this wasn't a tutorial.  Now that I am playing it, I find that I love it.  Will definately keep playing G5 GAMES.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just love this game to death. I would truley recommend this game!!! please buy this fantastic game,, trust me I know a good game when I see it. and it's free!!!!
B0073PZIYI|3.0|B rated movie....entertaining.....men with a 12 pack and popcorn will enjoy this.  I wouldnt pay anymore then redbox prices for this flic.
6304696558|5.0|I've only seen bits and pieces of this movie on tv a few times. I've never seen the whole movie till I bought it from Amazon. I really enjoyed this movie. But it did seem pretty long. Or maybe it seemed long because I had to keep stopping it or starting it over. Well I enjoyed it anyways.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game but wen it goes faster it is really hard to beat!!!!! But it is still the awesomest game in the world!!!!  -Alexia T. Horner
B0086700CM|5.0|Its really fun and entertaining I just heard about this and I just played it and its very interesting and cool. Its also challenging.
B0086700CM|5.0|soooo glad they added temple run to the app store I have Ben waiting forever for them to put this game in the app store
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I absolutely love the Scarlett 2i2! and totally recommend this audio interface. it is very simple to install and very compatible plus the extras that it comes with to polish your audio is outstanding I use this interface with an iMac and Macbook Pro on Garageband and connect an MXL 990 not the best of microphones but it makes this mic sound so good, and it's so great that you can connect two microphones and record them both simultaneously I record a lot of vocals so that is good for me and once in a while I plug my guitar and microphone at the same time and this allows me to use both 3 pin XLR and 1/4'' male cables. so don't think about it too much get this interface it looks very professional and has all the inputs and buttons in the front and since it's made solid and out of metal it will last a while so you can carry it anywhere with ease it is fairly small and the scarlet color on it looks very good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|the Best timewaster I have ever played!  have loved it since first sight! easy to learn - never gets old! great.
B000002ADT|1.0|Right in the best part, about 5 cuts deep, the CD begins to skip. It was not my system which cost more than I want to say.<br />Don't buy CD's any more. I won't.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Hello I'm telling you the order arrived and everything is in perfect condition. I'll keep buying more stuff. They are of very good quality. 100% recommended.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I'm not going to bore you with the details seeing that just about every other review here has gone into full, unadulterated detail about what this set includes so I'll just go ahead and add my brief two cents by saying that this is a completely justifiable upgrade from the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set, even if they both contain much of the same material.<br /><br />The transfers are absolutely beautiful and \\"Aliens\\" in particular has never looked or sounded better. Plus you get just about every existing cut of the four films available, including the more complete version of \\"Alien 3\\" which is a must watch for fans of the series.<br /><br />One of the things this one has over the Quadrilogy box set is MUCH better packaging. The DVD set was one of those fold out packages that was more insult than anything else. I'm the type that likes to get to a disc quickly, not unfold some ugly contraption six times just to get to one disc. The packaging here is more similar to the recent Blu Ray edition of the Star Wars saga, which came neatly packaged in a book-like case that was very convenient and elegantly designed.<br /><br />Also, some of the behind the scenes docs for Alien 3 were notoriously cut down for the DVD set but it's been reported that they've been restored to their original forms for the Blu Ray set, so that's a pretty big plus. The backstory regarding the making of \\"Alien 3\\" is probably the most interesting of the four for a number of reasons and the supplements do a really good job with covering all the different aspects of this legendary and troubled production.<br /><br />The wealth of information that you get in this entire set is mind numbing almost. It's quite a bit of material and if you like these movies enough to want to know a little more about them, then you've come to the right place. The Alien Anthology is an absolutely amazing set brimming with content and just about perfect in every imaginable way.
1597801577|3.0|This is a decently written SF-fantasy hybrid that is essentially warmed-over Ian McDonald (see Brasyl, River of Gods), a dystopian cyber-bio-steampunk ensemble drama with some really questionable science (energy storage in rubber bands (well, springs), anyone? and twisted/scrunched by elephants, no less). Its narrative scope, pace & breadth of concept is of the the-less-that-happens-the-artsier-it-is school (also see sometimes Paul J McAuley, Ian Watson). It can additionally be seen as a mashup of ideas from many a film (two that come to mind are The Quiet American and Blade Runner). I did not find it boring. I actually learned something, which was that methane is in fact lighter than air and can be used for lift (with the commensurate hazards). All that being said, scanning the reader comments here, it seems a majority of reviewers (\\"he uses too much weird jargon\\") have never Actually Read a Science Fiction Book before, or Learned a Bit of Thai or Chinese On or Before a Trip Abroad... Also, it doesn't take a genius to realize that if artificial people became available on the market, the very first thing they would be used for would be sex. Look at the Internet, duh.
B0086700CM|5.0|i was of the first people to download this(2 reviews when i downloaded) and i believed fully that this would be glitchy,laggy, and over all un-resposive like some other apps that have been switched from ios to android or amazon, but it runs perfect, and still ever so addicting, this game is HIGHLY recommended for challenges between friends or personal interest/satisfaction thank you imangi studios for this awesome game, and thank you amazon for finally adding this to your store :D<br /><br />syked customer
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I ordered this as soon as it came out, since I've read all of his other books and loved them. It didn't disappoint. I stayed up all night reading and finished it. Baldacci just has a way of keeping you turning the pages. None of his stories seem to drag, or disappoint.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love puzzles and this is a new kind of puzzle for me!!  I got it as a free app of the day and have been addicted ever since!!  It involves a lot of logic and the puzzles are challenging, but not so hard they can't be solved.  If you like sufdoku this is a similar type of puzzle, and it is just as addicting.  Mg only complaint is the squeeze are so small that it is sometimes hard to tap just one square. Overall it is great entertainment and I would highly reccomend it ti others!
B006QVRVJK|2.0|Hmm.<br />Even though the script provides all the necessary elements for a great movie, Jodie Foster (who is normally so capable), overacted annoyingly and remarkably badly, whilst Kate Winslett (equally capable of wonderful work), did not manage much better either.  John C Reilly gave a good and controlled performance, but the other male actor also failed to improve the problem.<br /><br />Perhaps the problem lay with the direction.  I don't really know, as the film could have been superb. I just realize more and more how difficult it is to get everything just right.  \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" comes to mind in this context, a movie where parties confronted each other with equal intensity.  Only there the mix and the acting was spot-on and the direction masterly.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Everything is successful here: casting, story, photography--everything. There are even haunting echoes of Moby Dick. Don't miss this one! It's one of the movies that you want to see without fail.
0307957934|5.0|Good to the last word. Compelling throughout.  Plot line was not predictable.  Good characters.  One of the best books I've read lately.
B007FH9GT2|1.0|I watched this movie with my husband after I had already seen the original Swedish version with subtitles. The American version is so dumbed down from the original it is insulting. Everything is spelled out as if the viewer couldn't possibly make simple connections about what is happening without being told exactly what is happening. The characters in this film don't even seem to have the same depth or likability. If you're not sure which one to watch, I highly recommend the original Swedish film.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So far I'm lovin it; I'm nearly thru the second book and its great.  I don't think there are  enough good books written about falling in love and developing a relationship.  I like that there are three books so you can get a lot of the details of their romance and the problems that happen.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The best kind of science fiction does not predict the future, it tells truths about who we are now. Wool touches on so many tidbits of contemporary human existence, but it does so in inventive, sometimes subtle ways. I put it at a very close second to my favorite writer, Ursula LeGuin, and her political novel The Dispossesed. The constraints of living in an underground silo could be an environmental allegory that points to our dangerous exploitation of limited resources. But the book does not stop at such a simplistic connection, it delves into the psychology of conflict, the roots of war, the ambivalence of power, the control of information.<br /><br />I found Wool simply by looking  for highly rated sci-fi after the disappointment of reading The Hunger Games and wish I had found it first. Wool has substance, nuance and relevance far beyond the teen angst and gore of THG. The wholeness of the other world, the imagined culture that can give insight into our own, is complete in Wool. Your suspension of disbelief will be complete after just a few chapters, and you will not want to leave the world of Wool. I especially love the multiple connotations of the titlle- won't spoil it for you though. Read for yourself, you won't regret it! My only regret is that there could be more at the end. Please support this amazing autor so he can give us more!
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved temple run but I hade to play it on and ipod. But now I can play it on kindle:)
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|What do you do when limitless vocal talent meets a genre where no vocal talent at all might do equally well (or better) on the charts? That IS a problem. Trespassing does a great job of fusing pop, funk and electro-modern production with a fantastic voice and inspired beats. It's fun, it has some heartfelt ballads -- and it comes full circle as a unified whole of an album. Personally, I could listen to Lambert sing with no instruments and I wouldn't care if he did covers. But this is what he loves; and if you're fingers aren't snapping from the get-go then I'd be very surprised!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome and I'm so glad it finally came out for the Kindle Fire for FREE. I play it all day.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I've heard so much about this book I had to read it, plus, the hype turned it into a book club selection. I won't say I hated it, but I don't know that I will read the rest either. The fact that Ana has so many orgasms one after the other and at the drop of a hat is so over the top I had to roll my eyes(and we know how Christian feels about that). It's like the author took the naive character and made her even more naive. I mean come on, she had no clue about ANYTHING!<br />I had a lot of problems with Ana herself. She has this beautiful roommate who has this amazing body, and Ana can fit into her clothes, however Ana's got this low view of herself? Not in any college atmosphere that I know of. Someone like that would at least have had a few dates here and there and if she had sex with Christian hat easily, there's no way she hadn't had sex before she met him. Come on!<br />As another reviewer stated, Christian is so perfect he's too perfect. Too unbelievable for me!<br />I was compelled to finish, but in the end I was disappointed. I don't know that I'll read any more if the other two are the same.<br />Since there are two more books I assume they are together somehow, but I think I'll get the synopsis from a friend rather than waste the money. I assume she takes him back but what was up with her leaving him? She asked for what she got then left and was all upset about it? She questioned EVERYTHING he said or did through the whole damn book and her wanting to talk all the time drove me bonkers! I mean, we leave her crying at the end over a decision she made based on something she asked for - she had to know it would scare her! Jeez!<br />I will say since this was my first 'erotic' novel I didn't know what to expect and it did get my juices flowing a bit, but nothing too exciting.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It quite honestly is the funniest game in the app store along with the other angry bird games. I would recommend it to anybody.
0345803507|5.0|I would rate this book with more stars but you don't give me the option!!! I loved (not even a strong enough word) the entire series. I feel in love with Christian Grey and could not put the books down. The story was amazing and very captivating. I pray that this is not the end of the Grey's story. I would love to dive into another Christian Grey story. I plan to re-read this series. I think I will pick up on details maybe I did not catch the first time. Thank you, Thank you EL James for writing this book. Please do it again!!!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Its is fun but I feel a little ripped off. A few platforms for this game get it for free with ad support. A few others are charged a single dollar. But the Kindle HD version costs 3 dollars. Firstly most people don't even care if it is in HD or not. Not only that but they force us to buy the HD version if we want it all.Secondly the Kindle dosent have any of the cool features like the space eagle and is always last to get any kind of update. I am really dissapointed at Rovio and their publishing companies for feeding Kindle users the leftovers since Rio came out.<br /><br />Other than that its a fun game and I would reccomend buying it.
B005LAIHGI|4.0|Sacha Baron Cohen's full-scale transition to \\"normal\\" comedy mostly works in \\"The Dictator.\\" Ostensibly a satire of the cartoonish extremes autocratic rulers can reach when nobody is criticizing them, in addition to American sensibilities and blind spots when it comes to their own leadership, it's plenty funny when it has no particular agenda. The shot of the wall of General Aladeen's seemingly endless pictures with blank-faced celebrities is wonderful, as is hearing a cover of R.E.M's \\"Everybody Hurts\\" in Arabic during an emotional moment.<br /><br />As Aladeen, Baron Cohen is basically a more malicious Borat given immense power. Ignorant, casually homicidal, and deeply antisemitic, he is easily removed from leadership by his uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley, admirably straight-faced the whole time). Presumed dead after losing his beard to John C. Reilly, he must reclaim the throne from his double (also Baron Cohen, with an ever-closer resemblance to an imperial Borat) and the his beard from ... well, you'll see. Aiding him in this endeavor is Anna Faris as a walking, talking compilation of every dorm-room idealist stereotype ever, and Jason Mantzoukas, a weapons expert who had previously been fired for not making a sufficiently pointy missile.<br /><br />The film is consistently funny, with Mantzoukas and Faris turning in strong performances, but the targets are a bit slapdash. There are a couple of good vignettes on that already well-explored region of Baron Cohen's comedy - redneckism (redneckery?) - but nothing too distinct. Likewise, the film could have had more fun with the sort of privileged do-gooderism engendered by Faris's character. And the climactic speech, with its blunt reminders of how America's political system resembles a dictatorship in more than a few non-trivial ways, is done with almost no comic flair, whatever you may think of its message. Personally, I found the random non-political bits to be the funniest, like when Aladeen reveals his plan to testthe claim of Cocowater to have more potassium than three bananas, or expressing his fondness for Yiddish due to its way of pronouncing words the way they sound.<br /><br />In any case, if you haven't already been tickled by Baron Cohen's work, there's no talking to you. Whatever the critics may say, Gaddafi and Kim Jong-Il would be proud.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a really fun game!  get it!  my 8 yr old loves it!  better than most games out there for kids and fun for grown ups too
B0071XO8RA|3.0|There is a lot to like about Wool. Some excellent writing, interesting premise, compelling characters.  But, all there is to like is easily lost to reader frustration. Underdeveloped plots, too many loose ends, not enough background and too much that is not plausible. Having read Books 1-6, there is no reason not to have an elevator. IT as evil is predictable and we never really see why the new Mayor is the villain that he is -- we almost get an answer but not quite. Without spoilers it is difficult to go into depth, but why would a man like the Mayor trust Lukas nearly on the spot? And \\"Cleaning\\" itself as a necessity doesn't make sense. Dozens of ways the lens could be cleaned. Linking exile and cleaning is problematic. Understandably, the author wants to keep his audience buying more books. We should therefore expect unanswered questions to some degree. IMO, the author crosses the line, leaving too much unresolved. I have no reader satisfaction (not asking for a happy ending) after completing 1-6.  But I like the series, the writing and the characters enough to wish it were otherwise.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|I am not an expert on the animation series. As a stand alone live action / science fiction movie, I thought this one was pretty good. Some said the special effects were lacking, but I found them more than adequate. The acting was very good. This is NOT a low budget B series film.<br /><br />I wonder what it would be like this film was voiced over in english? Sometimes subtitles can get in the way of enjoying the movie and really getting into the story. But those aside, it's a solid, if not a little bit predictable story.

0307266303|5.0|This is the book that started it all!  It showed me that if if old Taraumara indians could run for over 100 miles in huaraches, I could too.  This book taught me that running footwear should be \\"minimal\\" so as to encourage running in proper form (on the balls of my feet).  Because of this book, there are even Olympic athletes who are training in minimalist running shoes to improve their strength and form.  \\"Born to Run\\" has made barefoot running the new craze ... and we are all better because of it!

Understand that they were trying to stay true to life but I would have rather seen a bit more fiction and drama because the movie left a lot to be desired.  Not worth it.

B00000J7JO|5.0|I've owned this album for over a decade, and it's still one of my favorites.  It's difficult to write an incredible album, let alone an album where all 15 songs are excellent.  This album is easily among my top 10 albums of all time, and I don't expect I'll ever get tired of it.  Plus, it's perfect music for California in the summer.
B003AQBYUG|4.0|I want to buy the Alien Anthology (BluRay Import) from the UK, but I have 1 big question: Do the UK Bluray's have multiple LANGUAGE tracks (i.e. Spanish, French, Portugese, etc.) the way the US Bluray's do for this series???  Does anyone know???
B004WKOCP8|5.0|I thought Incubus might be on a decline after they came out with \\"Light Grenades\\" - but I've been incredibly surprised by this album.  It's a completely new style, but it still has elements of past Incubus albums, especially Morning View.  It's much more mature, much more melodic, and thoughtful, and it's become one of my top 10 favorite albums ever.  I especially love the song \\"Friends and Lovers,\\" one of my favorite songs of the last year.  I know Incubus fans are probably disappointed because of its mellow nature, but putting comparisons aside, I think this album is amazing - whether it stands alone or is part of the Incubus collection.  It just adds more depth and variety to Incubus' style over the years.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I purchased this headphone amp to see what all the fuss was about. It arrived quickly and well packaged (thanks amazon). After opening it, I was not super impressed with the plastic case, I understand the reasoning for it, but it does not seem as solid as it should. Does not come charged so give it at least 2 hours of charge time before using it. ( and don't use it while it's charging, it gets an annoying buzz). Sound quality wise is hard to judge, it does increase the total volume and dynamic range somewhat, but you will only notice this with a low powered portable music device. ( ipod, zune, computers headphone jack, etc) As these devices tend to be used with low quality mp3 files anyway, not much change will be noted. However, if you are using lossless or other high fidelity files, the difference can be remarkable. I don't recommend the eq settings, two are bass boost, and one is a level cut for pro audio. If you need bass boost, you have the wrong headphones, and pro audio equipment bought from a reputable company will have a quality headphone amp anyway.<br /><br />All in all I am pleased with my purchase, for the price it's a neat little amp. But in reality it is limited to ipod/ computer duty if you care about music quality.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This album is just incredible.  While it's only 10 songs, there is so much depth and variety to every song, that it feels incredibly complete and fulfilling.  Especially songs like \\"Death and All His Friends,\\" \\"Yes,\\" and \\"42\\" which have several movements and melodies that seamlessly combine.  Every song on this album is excellent, and that's what makes an album amazing is telling a story, and forming a complete body of work.  The combination of Coldplay's original mellow British guitar and piano work, mixed with cultural sounds of Asian and South American influences, is what makes this album unlike any other, and why it's one of my top 10 favorite albums ever.
0385737955|5.0|The Maze Runner is a great book for anyone who likes action and adventure as well as fantasy books.  The plot of this book is great because it clearly explains the problem as well as gives detailed descriptions of the characters while keeping your attention with constant action the whole time.  The main character, Thomas, wakes up in an elevator and can't remember anything than his first name.  When the elevator stops, he finds himself to be in a place called the Glade which is surrounded by a huge maze full of monsters called Grievers.  The Glade is full of teen boys until the first girl ever arrives in the elevator that he first arrived in.  Thomas soon finds out that he had a telepathic connection to the new girl, Teresa.  Read this book to find out what happens next!  With 10 being the best, I would give this book a 9 out of 10 just because it was a little slow at the beginning.  I would recommend this book as well as the others in the series to a friend because these books can keep anyone's attention as well as entertain them.  If this ever became a movie, it would definitely be on my list!

0486284735|5.0|The book was a great read- I hardly put it down for the 4 days I spent reading it.  It does differ from the movie in that Mr. Darcy really was haughty and prideful in the beginning instead of merely misunderstood, and Elizabeth Bennett was prejudiced, but both of course reconciled and became better people for each others' accusations.  Also, there were a couple additional characters and some of the dialogue was switched between characters, which made more sense than even in the more recent version of the film.  There was one notation at the closing of every (mailed) letter that I did not understand, but otherwise did not see many mistakes that would not have been in the original manuscript as other reviews reported.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Love love love this book!  I was looking for a new book to read and this definitely was it!  I could not put it down.  Highly recommend reading this.  The ending is perfect and leaves you wanting more!  Going to read her other books next!  I am hooked
B000093BDX|5.0|The CD was in excellent condition, was mailed promptly, and I'm entirely satisfied with my purchase.  I'd recommend the vendor to anyone.  With the demise of local record shops, Amazon is a fine alternative.
0812981448|3.0|Loved the concept and the first half of the book was excellent as Blake shared the story of how TOMS came to be, and the lessons he had learned so far. The second half, I lost interest as he strayed from his personal story. It got bogged down in the \\"why to\\" rather than the \\"how to.\\".<br /><br />I don't really care all that much what Pepsi is doing - has almost no bearing on me as a small biz owner. But Blake's own story and struggles? THAT's what I was hoping for when I picked up the book.<br /><br />So first half: 4 stars<br />Second half: 2 stars
0345803493|3.0|I know I am not the only one who has to keep reading these books even though the repetitiveness of the book is annoying!! Ana reminds me of bella from twilight in that she is whiny and should of been dumped a long long time ago, but the author made her strong S&M man weak for a weak woman. Sometimes I get so mad at what I am reading, she is crying, she is scared, she is happy, she is in love, she doesnt believe she deserves this man, she continues to degrade him when he gives her a gift yet I cant put these books down!! Go figure. I think if they were edited better with way less repetition, and the author used grown up words for a womans private area rather then \\"down there\\" \\"the area between my legs\\" \\"my sex\\" then maybe I would believe she is a true erotica author, but right now she sounds like her virgin weak character or worse a 15yr old trying to write an adult book. You can also tell that with this story she did research into the S&M world, but my guess is she touched the tip of the iceberg on that lifestyle. I wish this was a true adult author writing these, then they wouldnt feel like a dirty twilight minus the vampires! I think she would be better fit writing for tween girls rather then women.

B005LAIHSG|5.0|Just saw this movie today and was TOTALLY blown away!! I've read the original fairy tale, and grew up with the Disney animated version just like millions of others around the world, but this adaptation was original and compelling.  It was also much darker and more action-packed than any version I've seen before.  The little twists in the narration and plot are backed up very well within the context of the film and I found myself buying everything they fed me.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman was a tortured man full of sorrow who finds new hope in Snow White's quest.  He used a different accent, especially when his character was drunk, than I've heard from him before, so I had little difficulty in believing him as a mortal who is NOTHING like Thor, the character who propelled the actor into worldwide stardom.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is brilliant as always.  Her \\"evil\\" queen keeps the magic alive throughout the movie since she has to use several enchantments to both keep herself young and beautiful and maintain her power.  She has her own vulnerable moments which keep her almost identifiable to the audience, but not quite.  After all, who can really identify with the wicked witch/queen?<br /><br />The real surprise for me was Kristen Stewart.  I avoid all things Twilight and watched her with a very critical eye.  She did an amazing job as the other title character, managing to embody the innocence and purity of her character as well as the fierce defiance that is set up in the film as one of Snow White's defining traits.  I read later that she has been afraid of horses since she was a kid, but she looked VERY confident on horseback in the movie.<br /><br />In short, I HIGHLY recommend this version of Snow White.  It's NOT the Snow White your mom read to you, but it's most definitely worth the ticket.  There's even enough action and bawdy humor to entertain most men. =D

B000EHSVOG|5.0|I bought this movie because I am a big fan of Jennifer Jones, and I promptly became a big fan of disaster movies as well. This is definitely one of my top 5 movies of all time, and as such it is one of the few times I upgraded from the regular DVD to the special edition DVD. Totally worth it! I only wish Jennifer Jones herself had appeared with some thoughts about the movie. Even though this was her last film, she didn't die until 2 years ago at the age of 90. (She looked amazing when she made an appearance at the Academy Awards a few years ago.) I don't believe I have seen comments from her on any of her DVDs. Since her last film was so long ago, so many people today don't even know who she is anymore, especially people my age.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the movie. I was fascinated when I first saw this years ago. I will argue with anyone who criticizes any scene as not looking real enough because they did not have the technology we have today. The fire looked real because it WAS real! Today they always take the easy way out. Maybe it's because of fear of lawsuits, or maybe it is simply because they don't want to put in the effort. Or maybe they are just too scared. (Although I'd never want to be a stuntman, I admit.) Please, please, PLEASE don't let them ever remake this move! They remade Poseidon (twice in the same year, which was really kind of stupid). They were not too bad, but I ask, WHY? If something was perfect the first time, WHY? Remake something that was lousy the first time and can be improved for once. Wouldn't that be novel?<br /><br />The Towering Inferno gets off to a slow start. That is because we have to get to know and like the multitude of characters. (I am one of those unfortunate people who only remembers half the names at the end of a movie like this.) At about 30 minutes in - right about the time Maureen McGovern sings \\"We May Never Love Like This Again\\" - the action picks up. It's a beautiful song, if horribly prophetic. And we still have 2 hours and 15 minutes of the movie left. So that's when we get the fire and all the drama. Enough reviewers describe the plot, so I will skip that.<br /><br />The special features were great. Sadly, I learned some disappointing things. Steve McQueen wanted to play the fireman - a smaller role - because he felt it was a more substantial character. Nice, right? But then the writer had to add 12 sentences to his already completed script so he'd have the same number of lines as Paul Newman. Sigh. Movie Stars. How many pages is an almost 3-hour script? And he's counting lines??? And Irwin Allen. He didn't give a very interesting interview for such a fabulous director. What were the rewards for making this movie? he is asked. Money, money, money. Oh, and did he mention money? He brought up the Oscars. He didn't say anything about being part of creating an amazing work of art. He didn't say anything about the message of the movie. He only briefly mentioned the fact that the movie was given credit for making changes in fire codes everywhere. I have to say I am a bit disillusioned. The man must have already been a millionaire for years. He should have cared about something besides money!<br /><br />My favorite part of the special features, obviously, were the deleted scenes, because, of course, I got to see more of Jennifer Jones. They said they did not include them in the movie because they were not good enough quality, but they looked OK to me. Since they said they were part of a television broadcast in the past (not actually deleted?), I would have liked to see them actually included. I can't believe the movie would have been nearly 3 1/2 hours with them, but I would have gladly watched it. I loved, however, how they put the black and white shots before and after the deleted scenes so we could tell where the deleted scenes belonged in the movie. I have never seen any other DVD do that before.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT!!!* One little gripe here. I just read [[ASIN:0890839840 The Glass Inferno]], one of the two books The Towering Inferno was based on. And Jennifer Jones's character does not die in it! Why did they have to change that? I was beyond horrified when she went flying out of the elevator in the movie. Especially since they rewarded her by giving her a place in the elevator, since she was the \\"woman who saved the children.\\" Such a cruel twist of fate. In the book it was just some random guy. And it was his own fault, because he wouldn't follow instructions and sit down. But then, Jennifer Jones - or the man she loves - seems to die in almost every one of her movies. Such romance.40 The Glass Inferno]], one of the two books The Towering Inferno was based on. And Jennifer Jones's character does not die in it! Why did they have to change that?

B00571F26Y|4.0|I am really skeptical when it comes to ideas which are so against mainstream. The author did a good job of presenting his case. I am sort of convinced.<br /><br />But I love this book for a different reason. I got married 6 months ago. And since then I have gained 30 lbs. Seems like a typical story. When I analyze what happened, I see that we go to too many parties. I guess as newly wed couple, everyone was inviting us.<br /><br />When I was single, I ate only when needed. I never overstuffed myself. Parties at my single friends meant chips and salsa, pizza, wings and beer. No one gets offended if I eat only one slice of pizza. Basically, as a single guy, parties were about getting together not food.<br /><br />Now we go to dinner parties. Food is so much better, so I like to try everything. But dinner party hosts, especially in our culture, tend to focus too much on food. They will fill up my plate when I already full, or they keep talking about how I haven't eaten anything. To be polite I end up over eating.<br /><br />I have fruit allergies, so usually I decline fruit dishes. But I never thought about lying and saying I have other food allergies.<br /><br />This book gave me an excellent idea. I have started telling my friends that I have wheat allergies. Most people accept that. If someone insist on me trying their awesome bread, I start telling them about side effects of wheat, its drug addiction, and genetic modification. I even tell them to get this book and see for themselves.<br /><br />I have also cut down on wheat outside of parties. It has only been a week, I don't really see any difference in my weight. I also don't feel super awesome yet as predicted by the author. But maybe this is just in mind, but I think I have a flatter belly.<br /><br />Oh and cutting back on wheat has side effect of feeling deprived. Sort of like when I quit smoking. I know I will have big enough meal without any wheat products, but I will still feel hungry or more like unsatisfied. So I am very convinced about addictive-ness of wheat.ied. So I am very convinced about addictive-ness of wheat.

B0085157B8|5.0|*******The review contains spoilers so if you are intending to see this flick, you may want to read this review afterwards********<br /><br />After 2010's hit horror remake \\"Piranha\\" made a killing at the box office ($83 million worldwide on a $25 million budget), Weinstein Company quickly gave the go ahead to make an even campier sequel with the affectionate title \\"Piranha 3DD.\\" Tentatively scheduled for August 2011, the release date came and went without any word about the film. Weinstein soon announced that they would be releasing the horror sequel in November 2011. Once again, the release date whizzed by with no word from the studio as to when or if the film would be released. Now, on June 1st, the film has finally been released to horror hell. Opening in 83 theaters this weekend, the film is also showing on demand (where I caught it as no theaters within a 100 mile radius of me is playing the flick). With little press and even littler buzz, the film has little to no hope of making waves at the box office. Did Weinstein Company lose faith in the film? Is the film so awful that it simply doesn't deserve a theatrical release and the studios is simply fulfilling contract obligations? Let's take a step into these piranha filled waters and find out.<br /><br />\\"Piranha 3DD\\" begins one year after the famous attack on Lake Victoria by prehistoric piranhas. Extremely bad press from the incident has left the lake devoid of any life whatsoever. The town itself has been largely abandoned as a result of the drying-up of their main revenue source, tourism by horny spring breakers. At a nearby lake, two middle aged rednecks named Clayton (Gary Busey) and Mo (Clu Gulager) wade into the water to recover the body of a dead cow. Eggs laid inside the cow carcass, and before you can say \\"piranha meal\\" the farmers are killed by a hungry and very angry swarm of baby piranha.<br /><br />Enter Maddy (the lovely \\"Friday the 13th\\" remake star Danielle Panabaker) a marine biology student. She returns home for the summer to the waterpark she co-owns. She finds to her horror, and our amusement, that the other co-owner, her step-father Chet (David Koechner), plans to add an adult-themed section to the waterpark with `water-certified strippers', and re-open it as \\"Big Wet\\" where the \\"double DD's get in for free.\\" At a party at the waterpark that night, Maddy encounters several old friends, including her policeman ex-boyfriend Kyle (the enjoyable slimy Chris Zylka), and Barry (Matt Bush) who has secretly had a crush on her since grade-school. She also runs into two of her close friends, Ashley (Meagan Tandy), and Shelby (Katrina Bowden). It doesn't take long to guess who will and won't become piranha bait.<br /><br />Shelby and her boyfriend Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) go skinny-dipping in the lake, where a piranha makes its way inside her you-know-what(yes, you read that right). Meanwhile, Ashley and her boyfriend Travis (Paul James Jordan) go to have sex in their van. They accidentally trip the handbrake, causing the van to roll into the lake, where they are both devoured by the angry piranhas.<br /><br />The next day, Maddy is consoling Shelby about their missing friends. While sitting on a jetty, they are both attacked by the swarm of piranhas. They manage to kill one, and Maddy, Kyle and Barry bring it to Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd even stranger and more over-the-top than he was in the original) to examine. He informs them that the piranhas may be moving via sewage pipes and underground rivers between lakes. The trio return to the lake, where they establish that the piranhas cannot make their way into the outflow pipes connecting the lake and the waterpark.<br /><br />Back at the waterpark, we find celebrity lifeguard David Hasselhoff (played by himself in a hilarious, mocking tone similar to Jennifer Tilly's role in \\"Seed of Chucky\\") has been hired on as an \\"A list\\" lifeguard from the waterpark. It doesn't take long before the piranhas find theirway to the park to devour and feast on the lovely young teens and the families enjoying their stay at \\"Big Wet.\\"<br /><br />Sound silly, over-the-top, and preposterous? Of course it is! The film is \\"Piranha 3DD\\" not \\"Schindler's List.\\" You want big breasted girls being torn apart by piranhas? You want David Hasselholff running in slow motion to the Baywatch theme to save a drowning ginger boy? You want the death of not one but TWO annoying kids played up for two of the biggest laughs in the movie? Well, you get all of this and a hell of a lot more. Rating a movie like \\"Piranha 3DD\\" is a different proposition. The film itself is not nearly as good as the original remake (how's that for an oxymoron?) but I would argue that this sequel is a hell of a lot more fun.

Of course it is! The film is \\"Piranha 3DD\\" not \\"Schindler's List.\\" You want big breasted girls being torn apart by piranhas? You want David Hasselholff running in slow motion to the Baywatch theme to save a drowning ginger boy? You want the death of not one but TWO annoying kids played up for two of the biggest laughs in the movie? Well, you get all of this and a hell of a lot more. Rating a movie like \\"Piranha 3DD\\" is a different proposition.

B0009U55SI|5.0|I have always felt that the Fourth was the most problematic of all Mahler's symphonies.  In competition with the First, many people regard it as being the most accessible of all his works because of its relative length and a seemingly more straightforward musical profile.<br /><br />But it was the Fourth's allegedly more immediate musicality, what was supposed to be its more listener-friendly content and less demanding tonal landscapes that made it the most puzzling to me.  When reckoned in such terms, just what was one to make, for example, of its dreamily rhythmic themes, the deliberate juxtaposition of the grotesque and the sublime, its sweet curtness and its rolling expansiveness?  And whether one considers the final movement's setting of \\"Das Himmlische Leben\\" from \\"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\\" to be either inspired or aggravating only adds to a listener's vexation.<br /><br />In response to the interpretive challenges posed by the work, most conductors appear to opt for the affectionate approach, emphasizing harmonious balance, textural transparency, and an overall cheerfulness of expression.  Yet I could not shake the feeling that behind the Fourth Symphony's seemingly bucolic character there were more serious matters afoot, that Mahler--despite the fact that, unlike his two preceding symphonies, there was nothing overtly metaphysical about the Fourth--nevertheless intended the sunny waters of this work to run deep.<br /><br />It was only recently that I finally listened to Fritz Reiner's 1958 recording of the Fourth, and I found that his reading corresponded to what I have long suspected about the work, namely, that, beneath its generally pleasant exterior, there is a meditative melancholy at work throughout: at times wistful, occasionally sardonically alive, at other times marked by a sense of longing if not outright resignation; in short, Mahler's congenitally brooding nature might be taking something of a break here, but it's not a sustained one.<br /><br />Comparatively speaking, what characterizes Reiner's approach is his full-throttle display of orchestral detail (at points breathtaking transmitted by the RCA engineers); dynamic and tonal contrasts that do justice to Mahler's lighter instrumentation (without the chamber-orchestra sound some deem essential to this work's performance); and in general a more dramatic handling of the score that reveals just how hauntingly expressive this symphony is both emotionally and philosophically.<br /><br />Strap on a good pair of headphones and listen to the deliciously aural division and detail crafted throughout: for instance, the way Reiner and the Chicagoans allow you to hear in any given movement (the final one is especially good for this) not only the different sections of the orchestra but also HOW they are arrayed together in his taut but telling handling.  Some might find this approach unrelaxed if not strident, but if you let this performance work its magic and submit to this conductor's compelling logic, then you might feel like you're hearing what this symphony  has always wanted to tell us.<br /><br />I have other recordings of this work that I value (Mengelberg, Walter, Abravanel, Kubelik, Haitink, Klemperer, and Abbado--especially the latter two), but Reiner here reveals how Mahler's Fourth is a symphony as lightly serious as any of his others.

B00006D295|5.0|The MOVIE gets 5 stars, the DVD gets 2.<br /><br />The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a movie that passes from generation to generation. There is an undoubtable power within the film that manages to keep drawing in viewers almost 40 years after its initial release…which technically has not ended. For me, Rocky Horror is not just &#34;another great movie&#34;, but a way of life. It has been a way of life ever since I first saw it 5 years ago when I was 14. I also have the lips seen on some of the posters tattooed on my chest.<br /><br />The plot is a parody of science fiction and horror movies of the 1950's. Brad and Janet are a newly engaged couple who become stranded after a tire blowout on a road trip to visit their ex-tutor, Dr. Scott. They walk a few miles down the road to a castle they had previously seen to use a phone (true fans of RHPS know castles don't have phones) to call for help. They are denied the use of a phone, but they have arrived on a rather special night. It is an hour and 40 minutes of pure decadence and rock n' roll music. Yes, this is not only a comedy-horror parody, but a MUSICAL. I don't even like musicals!!!<br /><br />The Rocky Horror Picture Show has a strong LGBT following for many reasons. However, I feel that RHPS has something to offer for every kind of person. I see Rocky Horror screenings as gatherings for people who are misunderstood, a chance for them to go wild and just have a good time. I've gone to see it many times in the theater (many more to come) with many different people, and portrayed Rocky in shadow casts. For the record, &#34;shadow casts&#34; are a group of performers who act out the movie in front of the screen when it is being shown for a crowd. It is pretty much a huge party in a movie theater. Check online for Rocky Horror screenings in your area! They are still there, you just need to find them!<br /><br />Overall, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, but it's sad how theDVD has no good special features. I highly recommend that every single person watch RHPS at least once in his/her life.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A friend recommended the book , it turns out to be a romance novel . It is well written and I gave it three stars. It's a chick book and I shouldn't have wasted my time. It wasn't until after I read it that I heard about it being on Ellen D. Show and all the hype surrounding it. I won't be getting the other two in the series. Definitely a case of men are from mars  and women are from Venus and this won't be that exciting to most men.

B003SNJZ3Y|4.0|As the subtitle suggests, More Money Than God (MMTG) is about hedge funds.  There are a variety of hedge fund styles, from \\"macro funds\\" like Soros' Quantum fund and Paul Tudor Jones' Tiger (and now Tudor) funds to quant focused funds like D.E. Shaw and Renaissance Technology. The book gives an interesting overview of the various funds, their founders and the bumps (or sometimes blowups) they encountered.<br /><br />I have been fascinated by Renaissance Technology for some time. Renaissance is probably the most successful quant fund, year after year, in existence. If I were twice as smart as I am, I would say that I aspire to be Jim Simmons (the founder of Renaissance) when I grow up. The book Quants and MMTG attempt brief profiles of Renaissance, which is also one of the most secretive funds in a very secretive industry.<br /><br />Among the things that are remarkable about Renaissance is how little information has leaked out about them.  As a result, the profiles of Renaissance are shallow, at best.<br /><br />One of the themes in MMTG are the causes for various fund blow ups. The author makes the point that, from a formal point of view, risk management at Long Term Capital Management was actually very good. The problem is, VaR, ETL and any other measure you would like to pick is of no use if the instruments in your portfolio are, or become, illiquid and you can't sell them. The author relates a number of cases where funds became a major part of the market for some instrument. Or they were in a market where all of the players headed for the exits at the same time. As a result, when the market turned against them, they could not get out of their position. I have not seen any formal risk measure that will reflect this.<br /><br />We have actually seen a situation like this recently (May 2012), with J.P. Morgan and the \\"London Whale\\" who took huge positions and then could not get out of them (resulting in a loss of somewhere between 2 and 4 billion dollars, by some estimates). Once such a situation becomes apparent in the market, MMTG makes clear, the jackals will feed on the distressed fund.<br /><br />The only criticism I have for MMTG is that there are places in the book where the author goes on about how hedge funds should not be regulated because they present much less systemic risk than the highly leveraged investment banks. He makes some good points, but it gets old after a while. The author doesn't seem to notice that financial regulation has been captured by the very industry that it is supposed to regulate.stimates).

B007FH9GT2|5.0|If you read the book this movie is based on, you might have wondered how they would capture the complexity of the story, the edgy, murky atmosphere and the villainy of the crime.  This movie accomplished all three to my sense.<br />It was as good as the book and brought the story and its extreme characters to life. I relished Rooney Mara as Salander and Craig as the journalist.  The pace suited the story and the frames captured the bleak tones and sense of foreboding.  Outstanding movie--it enhanced the book for me.<br /><br />When our library mystery group read this mystery for its monthly selection we discussed the strengths of the book: original plot, crisp writing, contemporary issues, fabulous setting etc. but other mystery series have these.<br /><br />What made this book and movie so popular?<br /><br />Listening to the other participants talk it came back to one dynamic: Lisabeth Salander<br /><br />She's a modern-day super-hero. Her acumen and facility with computers is so agile, it seems she can do anything, overcome any obstacle, and get back at the bad guys. She fascinates us. We root for her. She's emotionally vulnerable but invincible at the same time. Most of us have never met anyone like her, but you can't help but like her. And she is on a heroes journey of becoming whole again, learning to figure out where she fits in and what her purpose is. Her immediate purpose is to overcome a series of obstacles and help to solve a missing person mystery. This is a central conflict that is, as my writing-lit instructor Adam would say, is \\"personal, concrete and specific\\". Will she and the journalist be successful? This is one reason why you keep turning the pages and watching the movie, but the other reason is that you want to see Lisabeth work to the height of her potential as she is so unique.<br /><br />She carries this plot--take her out and this is like many other outstanding, well-conceived mystery. With her in the story, it stands apart.<br /><br />In this movie the violence and sex was overly-graphic for my taste, but I was willing to put up with it to see what Lisabeth would do next.his movie the violence and sex was overly-graphic for my taste, but I was willing to put up with it to see what Lisabeth would do next.

It doesn't matter that much as this first is a great show--just know there is a prequel.<br /><br />Loved the plot-line in this one.  You've got a whip-smart, warm, humane and vulnerable detective, gorgeous scenery which is supposed to be northern MA but which is really Halifax, Nova Scotia, great supporting actors in the form of Viola Davis and others, unforgettable music which creates a moody-murky tone, and a quality production in every detail.  You will wish that there are more episodes in the series, so you will want to savor each one.<br /><br />This production makes me want to read Robert Parker books on which the series is based.

B0033H7VI6|5.0|Why I got it:<br />I have many nice survival knives among other bladed objects. I got this knife as a cheap (beater) knife that I could use for whatever fun I wanted without having to wince. This knife is perfect!<br /><br />Weight:<br />It's by far the thickest of any of my knives (considerably thicker and heavier than even my ESEE Junglas). This is key for most of the things I use it for. I wouldn't however carry this as a survival knife because it's just too darn heavy. You could instead carry a machete and smaller 5\\" fixed blade for the same weight.<br /><br />What I use it for:<br />I use this knife primarily for knife throwing. It has a smooth release out of the hand, rotates slowly, and packs a WALLOP when it hits. It feels pretty much like throwing a hammer. Even if you miss, it's going to jack up whatever it hits in a serious way. I also use it in my garden for digging holes for plants or carving a stake. THIS IS MY BEATER KNIFE (and I don't mind the practice of sharpening my knives- get a Lansky and never have a dull blade in your house)<br /><br />Edge:<br />I've dinged this thing of some paver bricks and only slightly marred the blade edge. It sharpens and holds an edge well.<br /><br />Handle:<br />Comfortable, however I wasn't so sure it would hold up at first. Consider, I throw this thing as hard as I can against a 4\\" thick pressure treated wall of side by side 2x4's. That wall (about 300 lb) does not give when struck. I miss frequently and hit the target with the handle. The handle is a rubber grip held to the tang with a several bolts. I managed to bend the bolt nearest to the handle and eventually whack it enough times to lose one side of the rear most bolt. 1) The handle is still completely secure 2) I could replace the bolt if it bothered me 3) This blade is BULLET PROOF, it will never take a beating harder than I have given it and even if I were to throw it in a fire and burn the handle off... worst case scenario (as a survival knife) its stillthick enough to either grip the raw tang or fashion a new handle from wood.<br /><br />FOR THE MONEY, ITS A BULLETPROOF BEAST OF A KNIFE!

B0079K4WEE|5.0|Presently, science fiction is undergoing a bit of a renaissance in theatres.  There's been a trend for a number of years now to produce films which have stronger ties of very human messages.  With motion pictures like DISTRICT 9, MONSTERS, CLOVERFIELD, and even 2011's BATTLE: LOS ANGELES, writers and directors have been spinning tales about the increasing human cost to our sci-fi encounters with the unknown.  Some of them have focused more heavily on the action quotient, but, by these films' conclusions, there has been ample analysis of the risks to the `regular folks' when faced with the unknown, may it take the shape of aliens, monsters, or other organisms.  PERFECT SENSE continues in this same mold, upping the stakes for individuals.  This time around, it isn't aliens we're facing.  Instead, it's an inescapable virus.<br /><br />Two self-possessed young professionals - a gourmet chef (Ewan McGregor) and a epidemiologist (Eva Green) - find one another at the most trying time in human history: mankind is falling victim to a mysterious plague that robs us of our senses - one by one.  Can a cure for what ails them - the plague or their own narcissism - reach them in time?<br /><br />I won't spoil it, but I will say that PERFECT SENSE is a perfect winner of a film.  Its narration bobs and weaves back and forth between the standard linear - think any other story - and the documentary - scenes and images captured from the greater world at large.  The more we get to know our two principles, the more that's stripped away from them, only forcing us to understand them even more as they collectively lose their sense of smell, then taste, then hearing.  It's as much a cautionary tale as it is an old school romance - boy-meets-girl, boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, but aren't they fated to find one another again? - is the best possible sense.  McGregor and Green's performances are comfortable and measured, especially when they're at the weakest - be it having one more layer of their humanity whisked away from them or when they're lost in one another's arms.  It's tragic and meaningful - sharp and resourceful - and, if you take it all to heart, you'll definitely come away with a tremendous appreciation for what smart science fiction looks like in the modern age.<br /><br />PERFECT SENSE is a product of IFC FILMS and BBC FILMS with participation from Zentropa Entertainments 5, the Danish Film Institute, Film I Vast, Bord Scannan Na Heireann / the Irish Film Board, and Sigma Films.  The script is from Kim Fupzaakeson, and it's directed with great attention to detail by David Mackenzie.  It all looks and sounds grand here, though I'll admit that I had to crank the volume quite a way up through part of Green's narrated voiceovers; I don't know if it was a fault of the original recording track or the fact that perhaps it was mixed noticeably lower than the rest of the piece.  Sadly, the disc only contains two features - a making-of short (2 minutes long?) and the trailer - and I would've definitely loved to have much, much more by way of commentaries and longer documentaries, giving more insight into this very special film.<br /><br />HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION.

The script is from Kim Fupzaakeson, and it's directed with great attention to detail by David Mackenzie.  It all looks and sounds grand here, though I'll admit that I had to crank the volume quite a way up through part of Green's narrated voiceovers; I don't know if it was a fault of the original recording track or the fact that perhaps it was mixed noticeably lower than the rest of the piece.  Sadly, the disc only contains two features - a making-of short (2 minutes long?) and the trailer - and I would've definitely loved to have much, much more by way of commentaries and longer documentaries, giving more insight into this very special film.<br /><br />HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|probably the best the drawing app ever. I had gotten another drawing app before this and it wasn't nearly as good as this one. the only problem is that sometimes it will take awhile to start a random game.
B0086700CM|5.0|Just got this fame a few days ago.  Highly addictive and fun game. Definitely worth getting.  My best purchase made this year.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm not going to offer spoilers or repeat what others have said. For the geeks out there (like me), the book was just a blast! I had way too much fun reading it, and loved all the 80s references. Keep writing, Ernest Cline, I'd like to read more.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run.my friends were always telling me to get it bcuz they said it was so fun.finally I can have it and they were right.thanks for making temple run for kindle
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game a lot . too much and too addictive to even stop playing the dang game too ha
B0069JBKHI|4.0|I've been waiting nearly a year for this thing... It came out in January 2012 but my husband and I decided that it was a bit late in the game to be buying a new monitor, especially a $300 one, since our son was nearly a year old at the time.  However, 15 months to the day after we set it up, our old monitor gave out, so we decided to buy this one.<br /><br />+We love that my husband can check in on our son when he's at work or away on a trip.  I believe initially, you had to pay to view more than 15 minutes per day, but as of late May 2012, that doesn't seem to be the case.  My husband has been spying on the nursery all day long.<br />+I love not having to drag another thing around the house with me.  If the house is quiet, you can hear the baby anywhere, but you can't hear him over the TV.  It's really nice to just start the app on my iPhone when we turn a movie on, and not have to worry about going and dragging out the monitor handset, finding a place to plug it in AND set it up so we can see.  I just peek at my phone if we hear a noise, and check whether he's just stirring in his sleep or if there's a problem.<br />+Multiple devices at once!!  We have two iPhones and an iPad viewing him at the same time, very frequently.  I leave the iPad connected upstairs and never touch it, and use the iPhone app when I'm downstairs.  I haven't tried any more than that, but I haven't noticed any change in performance with more or less devices connected.<br />+Runs on a battery!  Sure, it won't last all night, but the sucker doesn't stop running when the power goes out or when you accidentally unplug it!  Apparently it's rated for one hour of video or two hours of audio monitoring, but I haven't tested that, and I'm not sure I will any time soon.<br />+ Easy to set up, right out of the box.  I plugged it in, turned it on, and was monitoring within 5 minutes.<br />+The alerts are awesome.  I love knowing what the temperature and humidity are in the room, and I can set up a motion alert that will wake me before my son gets upset in the mornings.<br />+Creepy disembodied voice feature lets you use the monitor like an intercom, and talk to your child.<br />+Lullaby feature is cute.  There aren't a ton of songs, but it's not a crib soother, it's a monitor.  It's a neat feature.<br />+The night light is 100% adjustable, and each color varies in brightness, so you can set what's right for you.  The night light does not appear to interfere with the camera's night vision.<br /><br />-Lag.  Unless the kid has a gun in the crib, a 1-second lag isn't going to be a problem, but it is annoying.  I've noticed that if you leave a device connected for an extended period of time, the lag time increases marginally, but if you turn monitoring off then back on, it goes away.  It's generally about .5-1 second in my house, over wifi connection.<br />-Design flaw in the night vision.  I noticed that the picture was very clear most of the time, but had a strange brightness to it when night vision was activated, but that sometimes it wasn't present.  As it turns out, the \\"night vision\\" lights are reflected off of the shiny plastic base, and interfere with the camera.  I covered the base with a small piece of fleece I had lying around, and the night vision is incredibly clear.  It doesn't bother me, but for $300, I shouldn't have to do that.<br />-This is more of a note... the plug is kinda wiggly.  It's not normally an issue, but if you touch the monitor a lot, the plug can come loose from the base, and the camera will die.  Fortunately, the monitor tells you that!  And hopefully your little one is blissfully unconscious so you can sneak in and fix it.<br />-No discount for multi-room viewing.  A lot of monitors are set up in such a way that you can just buy an extra camera and view it on the same connection.  However, since this is an all-in-one bit, you have to buy the whole thing twice if you have two rooms to monitor.  I will probably never NEED two rooms monitored by video, but I probably would have bought the extra camera if it was offered (and cheaper), rather than using just a cheap audio monitor for the toddler when baby #2 comes along.<br /><br />=No REAL pan/zoom.  Our previous monitor had a joystick-controlled mechanical pan/zoom function.  This camera just uses a very wide angle lens to get the most complete picture possible, and you can digitally pan and zoom around that picture, but the camera never moves.  It hasn't been a problem for us, but there it is.<br />=Camera/base design flaw.  You do have to point the camera on the base at a certain angle, otherwise the base interferes in the camera, and you get even more of that awful glare.  When it comes to video baby monitors, this whole situation is tricky anyways, since there's the whole problem of trying to see over the rails of the crib.  No matter what, you're probably going to want the thing mounted high up, and pointing straight down.  This goes for any baby monitor.  Temporarily, we have ours propped up so that it's pointing kind of downward, but I'll be mounting it on the wall later.  It comes with an attachment to secure it to the crib, but that will only work for smaller babies who can't yet sit up and grab things.  :)<br />=iOS ONLY!  I'm not listing this as a negative item, because it is also positive, while it can possibly be inconvenient.  No, I can't watch from the computer (YET- rumor has it that Withings is working on this, and there may be an OSX app in the future).  However, this means that for anyone to be able to access my monitor, they have to be within range of it to make the initial connection, which then alerts all my devices that a connection has been made.  I haven't tried it yet, but it looks like I can disable accounts from viewing my monitor.<br /><br />Some people have reported problems getting connected and staying connected, but I haven't experienced it personally.  I also haven't needed to contact customer service, so I can't elaborate on that either.<br /><br />Overall, I like the monitor, and I'd still choose this one over others on the market.  It has a few minor issues, but they're more like annoyances, and there are no security issues or major flaws.  It would be a different story if the world of baby monitors was as advanced and high-demand as smartphones, but it's not.  And so far, this monitor is one of the best available.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the Fifty Shades series.  Although the books were quite \\"steamy\\", the story line was great.  I really enjoyed the growth of the main characters - Christian and Anastasia both grew as individuals as well as a couple.  Their relationship was raw and honest but also very loving.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad they finally decided to make this game avaible on the kindle fire.it was really  spectacular and awesome:)
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the Hunger Games series.  I actually saw the movie before I began reading the books.  If this had not been the case I am not sure if I would have enjoyed the books as much as I did.  This is not usually my type of reading material but I found these books enjoyable and entertaining.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game can be really time consuming! so if its a really rainy day this would be a very good choice!
0307970299|2.0|I tried, but could not force myself through the treacle and self-pity with which this book starts. I disliked the protagonist and her pushy ways, and that's no way to start a book. I jumped through it a bit, thinking it would improve when she started hiking, but again I was disappointed. Too bad, because I would have been interested in a story about the PCT, and how she found herself thereon.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|at first I was like awesome and then I played it for like a week or two tthen it keep like loading and wouldn't let me play :(
B0086700CM|5.0|This is lots of fun and addictive! I really enjoy the game. There is a delay in gestures sometimes, but that could be my device.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game. I have a little bit of lag on the Kindle Fire. but yet still awesome. Very addictive. Btw, they fixed the glitch. :/ But great game. Temple run + free = Happiness. :)
B002ZG981E|5.0|I've yet to actually watch it since I bought it for xmas (busy household) but the movie is simply genius and is something you shouldn't do without in your movie collection. Great sci fi flick you can enjoy over and over.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game is really awesome and fun! i suggest this game to people of all ages men, women, children, elderly, It can be played on mobile, tablet, Ipad, or computer. I purchased this for my son, but then my husband got addicted to playing.
0756655730|5.0|Definitely a thorough look into prehistoric life. This book was a gift from me to my fiance (trying to hone in on his specialized interest for my field of biology) and he has really enjoyed it's accuracy on topics that you can't really find many books on.
B003O86FMW|5.0|THIS SERIES IS THE BEST I HAVB READ IN A LONG TIME. IT WAS EXCITING AND WENT FAST, LEAVING YOU WANTING FOR MORE.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Product was just as described, works great. I use this product literally everyday and I have NO regrets. Shipment was extremely fast. Would definitely recommend this product and seller A++
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|THIS SERIES IS THE BEST I HAVB READ IN A LONG TIME. IT WAS EXCITING AND WENT FAST, LEAVING YOU WANTING FOR MORE.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|This was done very well and felt very realistic (if you can call a telekinesis story realistic). I enjoyed it greatly and plan to buy it for sure.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I've been an avid fan of Rollins for over a decade, and this tome certainly doesn't disappoint! Rollins spins a web that draws you into this epic telling of early American history as you've never imagined it. It left me, as usual with his books, chomping at the bit for more. If you've never read Rollins' books before, I encourage you to go back and pick up his other treasures--while each book CAN be read on its own, you don't fully appreciate Rollins' storytelling prowess until you're embroiled in the lives of his main characters. They become your family and friends--and you just can't wait to see what they will overcome next!
B004EPYZV2|4.0|Ghost Protocol comes in second on my MI movie list. In case you care and need to question my judgement in movies, I currently place them like this (in order from best to worst): MI1, MI4, MI3, MI2
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This Series was absolutely wonderful! I'm a little sad it's over, kinda hoping she'll write the book again in Christian's point of view. :D Just so I can read it again. Heck, I might anyhow! Beautiful love story!
B0074QGGK6|4.0|This is a quick, easy...and constructive read! The author is straight-on honest in a funny and inspiring way. His humor is a bit facetious but not sarcastic so he honors what you can learn from past artists and encourages new artists to step forward. Liked it a lot.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was just as good if not better than the first. The story continues right where you left off and the relationship, love story is beautiful!
B0086700CM|5.0|keeps my adrinaline running and keeps me anxious to see what  around the next corner<br />I love this game. Best app I've downloaded.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved! Can't say enough about how wonderful it is! It's so much more than just about sex. Couldn't wait to start #2! Must read all 3 books to really understand the whole story.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the BEST Kindle game that I've ever played!  It's fast-paced and there is enough challenge and variety to keep me from getting bored.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|So far this is the best ipcam viewer on Android. Easy to setup and use.  Picture quality is great and allow recording.
B007MGWBU2|5.0|A great film.  Love the cameo by Grohl and the a capella nod to Nirvana.  A lot of great tunes throughout the film - worth owning.
B0086700CM|4.0|so much fun! great way to waste time! was a great free app and I'm glad I downloaded it! ger challenging
B007U8U1V8|5.0|Only recently got into Jack White from his appearances on Colbert.  Having NO real familiarity with White's past works, I can only say that this album is one that I was immediately hooked on.  It's been a long time since I felt really excited about music - this albut got me there for several weeks.
B0086700CM|5.0|I freaking love this game! I love how you can play it easily, yet it's impossible to master!Good luck finding an end
B0086700CM|5.0|god im so happy to be able to play this on the kindle fire! yes yes yes yes yes :)
B0059XTUVI|1.0|\\"The Iron Lady\\" provided Meryl Streep with an excellent opportunity to play an individual suffering from dementia. However, it was a chronically poor interpretation of the life and times of Margaret Thatcher. So much is missing. If you do not already have extensive knowledge of Britain and British domestic policy in the 1970s and 80s (which most American audiences will not...) this film will mean nothing to you. The Miner's Strike and her relationships with Arthur Scargill and Ronald Reagan were barely touched upon! Yes, Meryl Streep is a great actor but we already knew that...<br /><br />\\"The Iron Lady\\" seems to have been made solely to win Streep another Oscar but that is not the reason I go and see movies. The emphasis on the least significant period of Thatcher's life has come at the expense of doing justice to the career of an important individual and a crucial period in Britain's history. Very, very disappointing.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I love this app and it is great for people who love chess.  For some reason I cant castle and that makes me mad but otherwise it is a fine app for being free.
B004CIIXFA|2.0|the acting may be good but why do people want to watch something so depressing? we all know real life can be miserable that is why they started making movies so we would not be so depressed. any way the acting is good but the movie felt slow to me i had to keep doing other things so not to get bored with seeing the main character walk around a lot.
