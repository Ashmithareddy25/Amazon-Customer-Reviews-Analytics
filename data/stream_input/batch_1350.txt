B005DMNS4A|5.0|The original Quadrophenia is one of my favorite albums, an excellent piece of work by the Who. But I think the remastered version on CD is quite a bit better. It really comes through nice and clear on my stereo. I had forgotten how good Quadrophenia is. The lyrics and music for every song are simply outstanding. Rolling Stone magazine said it's better than Tommy, and I have to agree. Pete Townshend is definitely one of the greatest!
1439170045|5.0|What a beautifully written story.  My grandmother suffered from dementia from her early 70s until her death around age 90, and all my life I've feared developing this myself. I found \\"Still Alice\\" to be quite informative about the early warning signs of Alzheimer's and other facets of the illness.  I was a bit apprehensive beginning the book for fear that it would be too depressing, but the portrait of Alice (and especially her relationships with her daughters) was so richly drawn and moving. Just loved this book - an amazing debut novel.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|What a super read.  Whether someone not interested in the Apple products, or technology at all, would enjoy this book is hard to tell.  But, if you do like computers, phones, the internet and basically anything that's happened in the last 30 years, then this is a fascinating read.  It has a very readable style without the dry academic-ness that many biographies have.  It has a fun, almost Forest Gump-like, sense of telling the story or a generation through one very interesting, if slightly weird, person.
B0071T5PN0|3.0|March 20, 2013 update:  I've since \\"re-discovered\\" this album on my iPod and have been listening to it more and more and must say my rating from 3 stars has changed to 3.5 stars.  It's not \\"1984\\" and it's not \\"5150\\" (my two favorite VH albums), but it still rocks...it just took me some time to appreciate, but once you've given it several listens it'll grow on you.<br /><br />I wish I could say this is 5 stars but it's just not there. I miss Eddie's sound from the Hagar years.  Also, most of the album sounds too much like a DLR solo album.  Just listen to \\"She's the Woman\\"...sounds too similar to \\"She's my machine\\" off his solo album \\"Your Filthy Little Mouth\\".  Beats Working sounds like a left-over song that wouldn't fit on one of DLR's solo albums.<br /><br />Blood and Fire is a great song and reminds of the 1970's sound found on the earlier albums.<br /><br />Stay Frosty sounds like Ice Cream Man part 2.<br /><br />Big River, if Sammy was singing it, would have fit on the Balance album just fine.  It's one of the better songs.<br /><br />Sadly, there are no stand-out songs like you'll find on 1984 (Hot for Teacher, Panama, Jump).<br /><br />To sum it up, the album is missing the signature Eddie Van Halen sound...it's too muddied and lacks the catchy intros and riffs we've grown used to.
B0070Z4M4I|1.0|Part of my job professionally is having to read through treatments written by Directors (well, I'm not entirely sure the majority of Director's actually write them themselves) for the commercial campaigns they're essentially pitching.  Almost all of them are a little over the top and they almost always say the exact same thing if you just swap whatever product or service it is they're going to try to sell us.<br /><br />I'm not sure if motion picture Director's have to sell their idea in a written treatment, but I wondered aloud if Vinken Von Duchsmieldt (or whatever his name is) had to write one to direct 'The Thing'.  If so, and if someone could score me a copy, I'll pay $5 for it.<br /><br />I paid $4 to watch 'The Thing' and I'm sure that whatever his vision was to get the job was hilarious.<br /><br />It's not that 'The Thing' is hilarious, but when you sit for a moment in your living room chair, alone because the wife and kids are gone to visit the in-laws, and think about what you just witnessed...you wonder how such a wonderful idea could be butchered so badly.<br /><br />I refuse to watch remakes of terrific movies and John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is FIVE STARS.  It's unparalleled in it's genre and still, to date, one of my five favorite movies.  When I read that this was meant to be a prequel to the 1982 film, I figured no harm-no foul.<br /><br />You have your mixture of Norwegians, Swedes, Latinos, Africans, and Americans all working as scientists in Antarctica.  There are a ton of camps up there for some reason, apparently...as we know there is the Pro-American Camp not too far away and find out there might even be a Russian Camp not too far away, either.  Who cares, really.<br /><br />We find out that the United Nations of scientists stumble upon the alien craft that spawns 'The Thing' and, of course, they fiddle-fart around with appendages and all hell breaks loose.  Now it's up to Casper Den Kompnenstov to make this a fun-filled-thrill ride for the motion picture thrill seeker.<br /><br />What you, your neighbors and I get is a confused mess that makes little to no sense.  It's 1982 and there are futuristic helicopters flying all over the joint.  Aircrafts crash 20 miles away from camps in subzero mountainous/rugged terrain and survivors appear at the door in three hours.  One guy leaves a room and then you don't see him until the end in a random control room (oh yeah, THAT guy...I wondered what happened to him), one guy leaves and gets violently attacked and then magically appears late A-OK (did The Thing not like him?), dogs disappear, the dogs owner reappears and randomly says, \\"That's no dog!\\" when the dog reappears.  There are more holes in this film than in a box of Honeycomb cereal.  It's truly astonishing.<br /><br />One thing that could save it some dignity is that we're currently residing in the 21st Century and we could really get some great features on The Thing.  A contemporary feel, so to speak.  Well, much like Lucas's prequels to the Star Wars Trilogy, you'll look back at Carpenter's version and realize that they just don't make 'em like they used to.  BORING, unrealistic garbage is what we get for the most part, here.  The first autopsy/examination we see offered hope, but it just turns into some sort of venus flytrap-Leviathon-upside down corpse concoction the rest of the way.  ZERO imagination, here.  I could have helped.  They had 30 years to think about it, for crying out loud.<br /><br />I will say that whoever the girl is who plays the lead did a good job.  She's got nothing to work with here but she's a good actress and I was happy she didn't get killed....or did she?<br /><br />Oh my GOD...The Thing really has me thinking now.  What am I going to do?<br /><br />Stay away and thank me in the morning, girlfriend.  Don't make the same mistake I did.get is a confused mess that makes little to no sense.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I admit I haven't been a big note taker since college. I'm still pretty much a physical pen and paper or post-it kinda guy when it comes to remembering things or jotting down ideas I want to remember.<br /><br />I mainly bought this App because it was free on my Kindle Fire so I decided to give it a try. My test run of it was for a fictional writing project I'm currently researching, where I'm utilizing both physical books and the web for my research.<br /><br />I started by using Evernote to keep track of quotes or small pieces of information I liked. I have not been able to get it to copy websites or pics for me on the Kindle Fire device, but maybe I'm doing something wrong?<br /><br />To fully utilize the App for this project, I decided to download it to my desktop PC. Grabbing websites and pics from here is much easier.  I pull up the App and literally drag and drop my information into it.  After syncing all of this information back to my Kindle Fire, I was much more pleased with going back and reviewing my notes and pics that I had collected.<br /><br />So, for me, it's good to have on my Kindle device solely for note taking, but I am enjoying it much more on my PC. The collage of information I've collected has been very inspiring and I only wish I'd had something like this back when I was in college!
0575083093|3.0|I'm really glad this is not the first Reynolds I read, because I really loved Pushing Ice and Century Rain. This? Not so much. I get that it's a space opera, and it's not that I didn't expect it to be sweeping and epic and have a million story lines, I did. It's just that the story lines were sometimes INCREDIBLY boring, and I only really started liking any of the characters or actually caring about interpersonal relationships (never one of Reynolds' strengths as an author) until the very end of the book.<br /><br />I also didn't understand why he chose to foreshadow things he never talked about later (unless they're picked up in the second book?) or why some of his cliffhanger endings in sections were never picked up in the following sections. (Sajaki attacking Solyova? I thought I'd skipped something the next time we saw those two.)<br /><br />For all that, Reynolds has a way of writing about space that reminds me of the vastness of it in ways that few things do. I never feel so small as when I read one of his books, which is both terrifying and awesome (in the original, not slang meaning of the word). The science and the technical details were well fleshed out and interesting, and I really, really enjoyed the concept of lighthuggers and how they work. And the sense of history that Reynolds brought to the story.
0786838655|4.0|I love Greek mythology so it was great to see a modern spin on some ancient gods and monsters! This is not harry potter but there are a lot of similarities in this first book (half-blood young male protagonist, brainy female and eager male sidekicks, goes to a special camp instead of a special school, main evil guy doesn't have a body and is trying to reconstitute one). Look past that and you'll probably really like it if you're a mythology buff like i am. I've read the next couple in the series and the potter comparisons basically stop with the first book, and things get even more original. Great start to an even better series.

0765322889|5.0|I've been trying to come up with a way to describe this book, and the series, but I lack the talent to fully express how much I adore this entire series. Steven Erikson is one of the most talented writers I have ever met. The world he created, and the life he gives to the characters is simply astounding.  The Malazan series portrays a world of pure epicness!  A world of scheming gods and immortals.  A world populated by inumerous races with a history that spans 300,000 years.  Even with all the epicness of it's scale, the author manages to give the characters incredible personalities that makes you truly care about what happens to them.  One warning though... It's not an easy book to get into.  When I first read Gardens of the Moon, I was confused as anyone.  This book starts by throwing you in the middle of an epic battle, in a world that's entirely unique in all aspects.  My advice, let it soak in. Gradually, things will start to make sense.  Still, don't be discouraged if a lot of stuff remains unanswered.  Continue reading the other books in the series and the world and it's mysteries will start to make sense, like one giant puzzle.  Bottom line is, I cannot guarantee you'll like this series. Some people don't.  But if you do, there's a very good chance you'll love it so much, you'll end up joining the ranks of Malazan fanatics like myself.
0307959856|5.0|I'm really enjoying Death Comes to Pemberley. I've always identified with Elizabeth Bennett Darcy, so I've read several post-Pride and Prejudice novels. PD James takes it to a whole new level. It's brilliantly writen in a very Austenian style.

B006UG90RM|5.0|VH is my all time favorite band, but I am just as quick to criticise as I am to praise. Having said that, this record kicks ass from top to bottom. Ironically, the weakest cut on this record is the friggin' single!! 13 songs of pure VH magic! Ed's tone is SLAMMIN'!!! DLR is in top form, and Al and Wolfie can hang with the best of 'em.  This is the HEAVIEST record ever created by VH. PERIOD.  A great comeback by rocks greatest band.
B00006I53S|3.0|I recieved this lens and was told it was out of a Canon 60d kit.  I only used this lens around the house for the first week.  Upon going out and shooting photos, I noticed that I have to hold the camera steady and facing forward or else the lens will zoom all the way out if the camera faces the ground or the lens will slam into the body if zoomed out and I lift the camera up.  I have multiple Canon lenses and have never had this problem.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|This is a controller for those who have spent more time with the 360 controller and want something similar to use with the PS3. Its larger than the stock PS3 controller and has a button layout closer to the 360.  I didn't notice any stickiness or control issues in using it although it wasn't as comfortable to hold as either the PS3 or 360 controller for long periods of time. In general, I found it to be a decent controller and a good choice for those who want to bring a 360 theme to the PS3.

B005UBNKZG|4.0|If you're looking at buying one of the FX series processors, first I recommend you do some homework over the performance of the Zambezi line. In case you haven't done so yet, I'll skip to the conclusion: the FX series provides no immediate performance increase from the Phenom II line. The FX series performs roughly as well as the Phenom 2 960 processor. If you dig into the reasons why the Zambezi processors don't perform as well as the high-end Phenom II's, the answer lies in how multi-threading is handled. The Bulldozer cores are AMD's physical answer to Intel's firmware Hyperthreading. I expect the FX series will see some performance boost from the way Windows 8's scheduler handles the Bulldozer core design, but there won't be a significant boost. So if you're looking for an upgrade from a Phenom II, you're better off waiting for the Trinity line later this year.  Now that that's out of the way, I really enjoy the FX-8120. It's a solid processor, with no performance hiccups or surprises. As I expected, it handles all of my tasks with ease, including heavy gaming. Combined with a Noctua D14, the temps rarely top 45C. Having moved up from a Phenom I, it's a small performance boost and a significant improvement in temperatures. I  Beyond that, there's not much to say. The stock HSF is the same that AMD has used for years. Works well enough for most applications. Overall, I enjoy using the FX-8120. It's rock solid, fast enough for anything I can throw at it, and it's still cheaper than an i7.

As a fan of P.D. James I anxious to read this book and was very pleased.  She obviously has a great deal of respect for Jane Austen and her characters.  I just wish we could have seen a little more of the original Elizabeth:  she was so subdued in this book.  But I recommend it to Austen fans and James fans alike.
B0061QD7YS|5.0|Over the years, Disney has gone from giving us quality to giving us garbage such as the stuff found on the Disney Channel (Shake It Up, Jessie, ANT Farm). This proves that Disney has not been as good as they used to be. Thankfully, however, some of the workers at Disney work their hardest to satisfy the fans of the older days such as myself, by re-releasing their animated movies for new generations, among other things. With the Diamond Edition of Lady and the Tramp, they are not only doing the fans of the classic Disney films justice once again, they are also doing ME some justice, as I am a huge fan of Lady and the Tramp. In fact, I was pretty hyped for this release.<br /><br />The story revolves around Lady, who is a pampered Cocker Spaniel, and a streetwise Schnauzer named Tramp. One day, Lady's owners leave her with Aunt Sarah and her Siamese cats while they go on vacation. The Siamese Cats mess up the house and blame Lady for it. Aunt Sarah decides to get a muzzle for Lady at the pet shop, but then Lady runs out. Tramp spots Lady and helps her get the muzzle off. And the rest of the movie is done wonderfully.<br /><br />As you can tell by the title of this review, I love this movie with all of my heart, and it happens to be my favorite Disney classic, and my second favorite movie of all time, next to Scamp's Adventure. The charm of the film is at a ridiculous high, and the quality of the sound and visual experience are at its very best.<br /><br />Particularly the voice acting is among some of the best in any animated movie. Barbara Luddy is the perfect voice for Lady, and it's one of the best voice overs I have ever heard in my life. Lady happens to be my favorite character in this movie, because of her voice, and she's just so freaking cute! How could you not love her? I love her personality, her design, and anything else that is good about this character. This is one of those characters that I could just reach into the screen and hug.<br /><br />Tramp also has a very good voice actor by the name of Larry Roberts. Roberts is the perfect voice for Tramp, and also adds to the character's street-wise personality. Tramp also has a very positive attitude towards his life, especially since his life is poles apart from Lady's. It's also very fun to dub this character when watching this film, just like with Scamp in the sequel. Tramp is the perfect other-half for Lady.<br /><br />The art value of this film could not be any more spellbinding. The animation is some of the freshest, most vibrant animation I have seen in a Disney classic. The sole Disney Classic about animals that I think has been able to do this is Bambi. The characters in Lady and the Tramp are animated very well, and move so stunningly, almost as if they were real. This is why I miss hand drawn animation, and why animators need to step up and use this kind of animation for their movies, not computer generated animation. Yes, I like some CGI animated movies, such as most from Pixar and Dreamworks, but CGI is not a very satisfying type of animation in my eyes. Hand drawn animation is much more emotional and moving than anything of CGI.<br /><br />What else does there need to be discussed about the movie? This is Disney at its best, and I hope Disney doesn't stop making re-releases of their classic movies.<br /><br />Also, another thing I have to point out is the trailer for the sequel that is featured on here. Best trailer for a movie I have ever seen... hands down. Go buy the Lady and the Tramp Blu Ray for any generation. You will save the world from falling into the pit.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars/5 starsf Larry Roberts. Roberts is the perfect voice for Tramp, and also adds to the character's street-wise personality. Tramp also has a very positive attitude towards his life, especially since his life is poles apart from Lady's.

0439023513|2.0|First, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books of the trilogy.  The Hunger Games and Catching Fire are incredibly creative, well-designed, and compelling.  As I began Mockingjay, the third and final book, I anticipated any number of possible directions that Collins could have taken with the plot, with the character development, and with the ultimate statement, or universal theme statement, as we English teachers like to call it.  I was genuinely intrigued and excited to read this book.  That said, I can hardly be more disappointed by the result.  Peeta is lost and he won't return because of the damage that has been done.  However, the reader is hopeful that we'll see that moment which lets us know he will make it.  We never see that, but somehow, magically, in the end, he must be all right, because he is married to Katniss and they have children.  How did this happen?  What event or events healed him?  His love for Katniss?  Her love for him?  The readers are left in the dark by this outcome and where it came from.  President Snow was evil and manipulative, but towards the end, Collins gives us a small crack to peek through into the possibility that he may actually be more truthful than President Coin, who shows us her manipulative, controlling side.  Exactly how far Coin is corrupt, evil and/or deserving of her death, we don't ever really find out.  We know Katniss kills her, perhaps to stop the replacing of one tyranny with another, but the resolution is largely left to the reader to create.  There are just too many blanks to fill, and we need more from Collins to take us to our final inferences and conclusions.  Katniss herself is our strongest character, but she proves far too frail to endure, and, in the end, she crumbles.  Was her final arrow one that was shot out of strength or weakness or insanity?  Katniss finally dissolves into nothingness, not caring for herself or others but somehow getting married and raising children in an almost catatonic state of existence that is at best meaningless.  Has she healed?  Obviously not.  Is she emotionally and spiritually damaged?  Without a doubt.  Will Peeta's love heal her in time?  There's no way to tell, because we don't know how Peeta got to a stable place, or even if he ever did get there.  And what of Gale?  Has he transformed into part of the killing machine?  We are given enough to infer that he has, but what was it inside or outside of him that pushed him beyond the capacity for compassion?  Prim's death seems to be pointless and is never explained.  How was it she was put into that square and why would Coin put her there?  The motive for her to be there or for her to be PUT there in harm's way escapes me.  As readers, we never gain any further insight into Prim or the meaning of her death.  It's just one more horrific act of pointless violence that pushes Katniss into her shattered final state.  And that shattered final state begs the question that is quite damning of the entire trilogy.  The trilogy is written in first person.  FIRST PERSON.  We are carried through all three books by the narrator, Katniss, as she relates her story.  We share her wonder, her compassion, her sense of outrage, her deep thought and private moments, her hurts, her confusions, her dreams, and her past, present, and hopes for the future.  In order to do this--to relate the entire story that has occurred--she has to be in a state that is capable of relating the tale.  Katniss at the end of the story could NEVER have told this story.  She is too empty, too void, too uncaring, to have the ability to weave this story. Yet Collins has chosen first person point of view when that person is incapable of telling the story.  For this story to have worked at all, Collins had to use third person, as her main character, Katniss, ends up incapable of being the strong narrator revealed in books one and two.  The narration cannot be stronger than the character's ability to narrate, and let's face it: Katniss was not capable of narrating such an intricate, thoughtful, far-ranging tale at the end of Mockingjay.  Ultimately, we are left with nothing.  No triumph.  No defeat.  Just pointlessness.  Is that the point?  If so, that's truly a shame.  None of the developed characters teach us anything, and we learn nothing about ourselves in the process.  There are great books that take us on a journey to the realization that war is hell, that tyranny is evil, that the loss of our humanity is a tragedy beyond words.  This work does not take us on any of those journeys.  It takes us partway on a journey to a place that we never find, teaching us a lesson we can never learn.  There may be those who say that IS the message/theme/meaning of this book.  I'm not one of them.  William Faulkner, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950, said most appropriately, \\"Our tragedy today is a general and universal physical fear so long sustained by now that we can even bear it. There are no longer problems of the spirit. There is only the question: When will I be blown up?\\"  That is the tragedy of The Hunger Games trilogy.  Its point is the fear that we will be blown up and that will be a tragedy.  Faulkner went on to say, \\"Because of this, the young man or woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat.\\"  Collins gives us characters who are in the throes of this conflict.  Katniss cannot choose between Gale and Peeta, between war and peace, between fighting and running away, between survival and sacrifice.  As readers, we hunger for the resolution of these conflicts.  Faulkner maintained that a great writer bases his/her writing on \\"the old verities and truths of the heart, the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed - love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice. Until he does so, he labors under a curse. He writes not of love but of lust, of defeats in which nobody loses anything of value, of victories without hope and, worst of all, without pity or compassion. His griefs grieve on no universal bones, leaving no scars. He writes not of the heart but of the glands.\\"  Sadly, The Hunger Games trilogy ends (in Mockingjay) by discounting the worth of these universal truths and takes the reader to a realization that none of this matters, because we will end up dead or crazy or manipulated or mute.  Mockingjay seems to be exactly what Faulkner spoke out against when he ended his speech by saying, \\"I decline to accept the end of man. It is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply because he will endure: that when the last ding-dong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible voice, still talking. I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail.\\"  Unfortunately, Ms. Collins has not learned these things.  The potential of the first two books is betrayed by the fatal flaws of the third book:  the loose ends left by both plot and characters, and the fractured choice of first person point of view in which to tell the story; and ultimately, the conclusion that the struggle of \\"the human heart in conflict with itself\\" is meaningless and doesn't really NEED to be resolved.

There aren't as many blades, Feint doesn't work and no giant pomegranate at the end.  The free version on my Kindle was better, I don't understand why I paid for this if I'm getting less?  Don't download this version if you love Fruit Ninja, it's NOT the same as my other (paid) versions on my iPod and android phone.
B004CR5TD0|3.0|I feel like I am sounding too harsh in this review, but I haven't altered it, it preserves a response whether totally valid or not.  (Well, okay, I changed one word...)<br /><br />So basically this is Antony & the Johnsons with more varied and sophisticated musical ideas and a less rigorous commitment to sexual identity issues and/or eclecticism.  Which only means that covering Joni Mitchell and Feist sounds a lot fresher than covering John Lennon.  But so far, nothing beats Antony covering Lou Reed (on Animal Serenade and The Raven), so Antony fans might well be miffed that Blake has nicked Antony's revolutionary voice and taken it mainstream, while allowing us to forget about the \\"g\\" word.  Well, not mainstream exactly.  At least not yet.
0439023513|4.0|So many other reviews have been written, I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't been said already. But I'll give it a shot.  As with the other books in this series, I forgot that I was reading YA fiction. Mockingjay does divert from the series somewhat in that it is even deeper and darker than the earlier books. But that is as it should be as the story progresses. Things always get worse before they get better. Like other reviewers, the amount of time Katnis spent in the hospital was annoying to me. I also didn't care for all the pods being set off in the capitol, but I related those to the booby traps in Vietnam. Also, I would have liked to know what was in the letter that Katnis's mother wrote to her. After the years of emotional abandonment, it would have been nice to hear what she had to say.  All in all, I enjoyed the entire series. I felt like the author pulled from all different generations that have seen war and deprivation of all kinds. I see Snow as someone like Caligula, Haymitch as a WWII vet, Peeta as a returning Vietnam Vet, Katnis who starts out as an apathetic teen who can only see what is right in front of her face and does grow. Sadly, just not in the direction we would like. But that's life. Gale as a young radical in the 60's. Coin as the communist. I could go on, but you get the point.  Great series!
B000XR4OC0|1.0|Having lived in Argentina, I can tell you that these shoes normally sell for under $10 USD. They are meant to be slippers in the house and around the farm, not for walking on pavement (although I do and people do, it is not normal). They also tend to wear out after a few months. Toms have better insoles and cuter designs, but the outer sole is the same cheap material that will wear through quickly. Also, you can't wear these if it is raining! The bottoms are very slippery on wet pavement.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This whole trilogy sucks you in. You better have all three books on hand because you won't want to take a break from reading to run out and get the next one. It is hard to put down ask the characters become real and the feeling that you're part of the story, right there next to Katniss in the arena is overpowering.

0307949486|1.0|I was supposed to read this book for a book club I am in. I generally like to read books I enjoy, as I am sure the majority of us do. This book however, is HORRIBLE. I can't even finish it. Maybe I am missing something but I think it is dreadfully boring, I can't keep any of the characters straight, and it just drags. For that reason, I stopped reading the book after 200 pages. I just can't subject myself to reading it anymore.
1586487981|5.0|I daresay and Banerjee and Duflo are genius in their approach.  She has taken what we, from developing nations have known for decades, that the poor are the best economists.  They have a lot to loose.  This will be a classic for economists.  It is a must read for anyone who wants to donate money or change the lives of those who are poverty stricken.  It appeals to me because it uses the scientific approach to the problem of global poverty.  Their thinking is radical to western observers, and should be studied before pontificating on what are the causes of poverty and what can help in developing nations.
0439023491|5.0|With how the immediacy of the first one ended, I was thinking CF would pick literally one second later, so I surprised that it didn't, yet it gave enough backstory of all of what happened in some time. Routines and depression, emotional distance and physical distance from key people Katniss is close to. Yet, because of her one \\"little\\" act of defiance to save hers and Peeta has done more than she had ever thought would do: strike a match of fervency in the spirits of the Districts that will continue to build up. And when it blows, not only does the situation blow up, all the expectations one would have, including conspiracy theories about social complacency by design start to make sense.<br />What I liked the most was how it defied the traditional sense of rebellion- including moral decisions that would either go one way (the \\"safe way\\" which would give the government a good reputation) or another (the one the people want yet are afraid to do on their own). The other tends to be the match strike, even if it's only a tiny spark, it tends to be enough later on to help Katniss get through her situation- including another Hunger Games, and, this time, it's even more intense and grotesque. Even in the face of trying to figure out who to off and who else to deal with and who to trust, apparently, there are rebellious factors.<br />Yet it was the massive twist ending that completely took me off guard. All my hopes dashed, yet intrigue still continued, and so did hope.
B000PWIF4G|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time, this story is told from several perspectives which converge into a beautiful climatic chapter that will not leave you quickly.  Stay with it, if it is hard for you at first to get through all the names.  It is worth it.

B0017SWPXY|4.0|A new way to approach \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is to take it on as a mystery, the central question being can author Garth Stein pull it off writing a book from a dog's point of view. It isn't a spoiler to let you know that, yes, he can. Most definitely.<br /><br />The novel, a tear jerker for adults that should be sold accompanied by a box of Kleenex, outdoes \\"Old Yeller\\" and even \\"The Yearling\\" in the emotional wreckage it leaves behind.<br /><br />It's a story about Enzo, the part-lab pup snatched up by auto mechanic Denny Swift. Swift, who aspires to be a Formula One driver, and his steadfast canine companion navigate the twists and turns thrown at them by fate and circumstance. It's also a story about professional auto racing as a metaphor for the hazards of a life lived not knowing what awaits around the next hairpin turn. It's also a story of a family - Eve, whom Denny marries, and their daughter Zoe.<br /><br />Enzo narrates their story and he has a point of view that's all-knowing and filled with intelligence about the world and the humans who are part of his life. He's learned everything he needs to know from observing Denny and from watching T.V. documentaries and the Weather Channel, which Enzo realizes is more about the world that about current weather conditions.<br /><br />From watching a National Geographic program about Mongolia, Enzo has come to believe with his entire canine heart that when a dog dies its soul becomes free to come back to life as a man. Enzo's mantra is \\"that which you manifest is before you,\\" which means in his eyes, his destiny is to leave his dogness behind and come back as a human.<br /><br />Not plausible. Melodramatic. Emotionally manipulative. Yes, the book is all those things and yet it succeeds as a shaggy dog story that manages to grab your heartstrings and never let go.<br /><br />Enzo's senses are sharp and he says he knows what greatness is, and to his dog sensibility greatness smells as delicious as roast pig. \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" may not smell quiet as good as roast pig but it sure comes close.as roast pig but it sure comes close.
B002N8A14M|4.0|With the high turnover rate of technology, it's getting harder & harder to find items for the things you STILL have that are perfectly functional.  I'm glad I was able to find this, I really like the plastic case the covers the iPod-Gen5 entirely (except for the touch wheel), as the old one is now covered in scratches after constant dropping, & scraping. I like the clip-on aspect so I can easily wear it on my belt, pocket, or shirt pocket. I really do not wear the arm band & wish the case would be sold separately, but on the plus side the price runs the same as other cases without the arm band.  Delivery was on time.

0807130087|5.0|A friend attempted to foist this book upon me for years, and I refused.  He even handed me an audio version so that I could listen to it while gardening, but again I refused.  Then one day I picked it up and started reading, and I didn't stop laughing until it was over.  Only a few books ever have made me laugh out loud continuously:  Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers Guide was one; a few P.J. O'Rourke books made me guffaw.  This book made me giggle, snort, and laugh alternatively throughout.  I highly recommend it.  It is ridiculous and over-the-top, and every one of you knows an Ignatius J. Reilly.  I met one just recently.  P.S.  Read the book completely before reading the author's biography.  Just trust me.

1846555248|5.0|Le Cirque des Rêves comes to town with no warning. It is only open at night. Inside each of the black-and-white striped canvas tents is a breathtaking unique experience.  I just finished this book and my brain is still swirling. I can see why this is a love it or hate it book. Some reasons that people may hate it are:  * The timeline jumps around from the early 1890's, to 1895, to 1893, back to 1898, up to 1901, back to 1899, etc. It was very struggling to read; she be in 1895 for a chapter, jump around through years for 5 or more chapters, then go back to 1985  * There are a lot of 'main' characters (15 in all!).  * Each chapter is told from a different characters perspective, and if that isn't enough, some chapters are written as if you are the one walking into a tent.  All of this being said, I am definitely in the 'loved it' camp. It takes a skilled author to be able to pull all of this off.  The writing is gorgeous. Don't worry too much about keeping track of everything. Read it and get lost in the magical beauty of the book and the circus.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I have been reading Mr King's books for thirty years now! I have read them all. Mile 81 is a horror story. His books of late have been more suspense/mystery types but this one goes back to why I fell in love with his books to begin with. It takes the ordinary and turns it creepy. Normal mundane things become evil monsters!! As you already know this story is about a people eating car. Each victim is literally pulled into the death trap, and as it is happening I was shaking my head and wanting to yell at the poor happless, soon to be snacks!  This was also the first thing I read on my Kindle. I got it for Christmas and then took a trip to Seattle to visit my family. It made for a great time passer and like so many of the other reviews have said...I didn't want it to end so soon. Thank you Mr King, once again for a good scary read!
1897299214|1.0|I am surprised at the positive reviews of this book. Although it is interesting in some ways, it presents North Korean culture with little compassion or humanity. The author describes his visit to North Korea according to how it served his personal comfort and sense of style, and with little reference to history or context. The North Korean government notwithstanding, ridiculing the shoes worn by the women on the street and making sweeping statements about how &#34;all&#34; Asian hotels are crummy is just ignorant. And probably racist.  There are many very good books about North Korea -- skip this one. If you are looking for a good graphic story about one of the countries belonging to George Bush's &#34;Axis of Evil,&#34; read Persepolis.

B005LAIIS0|5.0|What is an epic? An epic is a story that defines an entire genre as it should be, giving way to non-stop character development and a conflict that is either unresolved or is just resolved for the main character(s). An epic is a story with such a deep meaning and deliverance that it can go down in the history books for being life-changing or truly open minded. Examples of these are Gladiator, The Iliad, Saving Private Ryan, and Blade Runner; historical and science fiction epics. Now, there is the survival epic; The Grey. Starring Liam Neeson, this story about human courage and endurance is a simple, yet complex tale; the performances by every actor in the film are just stunning, believable every second of the time. The direction and pacing of the action scenes and in-depth storytelling was some of the best work i've ever seen; it's what you'd expect if Ridley AND Tony Scott were both producers of this film. Their presence just tells you that this will be epic in some way, shape or form, and it is. In a solid 117 minutes, this film dives head-first into a pool of our worst fears and comes out an emotional masterpiece with a deep meaning and an epic conclusion that makes you see how valuable life really is. Some people say the ending was stupid, pointless or unnecessary, but when you watch it, pay attention to Ottway's father's poem and recognize the events that happened on the way to where he ended up; this film truly is a survival epic.<br /><br />\\"Once more into the fray, into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live and die on this day. Live and die on this day...\\"
B006H3MIV8|4.0|First thing I did after purchasing Chimes of Freedom is divide the songs up into my own four disks of great, good, so-so, and terrible material. About half of the covers belong to the first two categories with some truly great ones thrown in. the Gaslight Anthem's \\"Changing of the Guards\\" is quite simply awesome, Pete Seeger's \\"Forever Young\\" rumbles happily along, and State Radio's \\"John Brown\\" is superb as are the offerings by Tom Morello, Jackson Browne, Taj Mahal, Lucinda Williams, Patti Smith, Mariachi El Bronx, and others.  I disagree with other reviewers who have said that a compilation of already existing great covers would have been better. Almost everyone is familiar with the old greats by The Dead, The Band, Jimmy, Joan, Johnny, etc. And any serious Dylan listener has come across more recent superb covers by Rage Agenst The Machine, Cat Power, Nick Cave, The White Stripes, or the lot that was offered on the \\"I'm not there\\" Soundtrack. This, however, adds a new dimension and also opens up Dylan's work to younger fans, and honestly, Maroon 5's version of \\"I shall be released\\" is not bad, and Miley Cyrus can also hold her own.  Of course there a lot of guys trying too hard (e.g. Elvis Costello), or interpretations that are just plain boring (e.g Mark Knopfler) but what's obvious is that the material here is so strong, it takes serious effort and dedication to completely butcher it. Only Ke$ha really succeeds there. 4 stars because there's roughly 35 songs here worth a repeated listen.
B00522Q6CM|1.0|This 3 disc set might seem a decent buy at first glance if you don't mind the first X-men movie disk as wide-screen and the other 2 films as full screen. However it's real fault is that the  disks are faulty and will not play. Avoid this set.

B0073LJ61S|5.0|There are so many reviews on the songs already so I'll just give the explanation I give when people ask me about it. This CD is heavy, has no synthesizers and reminds me of very early Van Halen - Van Halen I, Fair Warning and Women and Children First. It also contains some of Eddie's best guitar work on a CD to date... seriously.  When I first heard Tattoo I didn't know what to think. But after hearing the whole CD, my theory is that after they finished the CD, someone realized that nothing was \\"poppy\\" enough to be a single and Tattoo was the result. NONE of the remaining 12 songs are like Tattoo.  However, don't forget that VH never worried about the \\"rules\\" of hard rock albums and released songs like Big Bad Bill (is Sweet William Now), Ice Cream Man and Happy Trails. Those songs are all considered classics today.  It's also great to have a new Van Halen CD that doesn't use Sammy's \\"let's write ANOTHER sappy watered down song about love\\" formula. It's great to have DLR back.

1594203334|5.0|I've traveled quite a bit in my pre-parenthood days and have witnessed the fruits of parenting styles from all over the world.  I loved this book because it was much less a parenting guide and much more an account of cultural immersion in regards to parenting.  We had decided early on not to read any books on parenting styles and to try to go with our gut instincts.  Turns out, what we had been doing is what the French had figured out long before.  I couldn't put it down and was sad when it was over.

B0015DROBO|4.0|If you can laugh at the occasional digs at \\"American tourists\\" (and we complain about foreign tourists, too-but you get the feeling this author had a bad experience with American tourists)  throughout all three books you will find that these are enjoyable yet disturbing stories; characters that are odd yet persona's that you will find yourself relating to and finding people that you personally know who remind you of Blomkvist, Salander, Wu, Eriksson, Armansky, etc...I am sad that Larsson is no longer around (died in 2004) to continue to write about these characters as the stories are very well written...however, they do feel a bit rushed at certain points and I did find some inconsistencies that good editing should have corrected; with that said, I definitely feel sad that these characters will never be heard from again. it would have been interesting to see how much deeper we could have delved into Salander's interesting life and perhaps learn more of her twin sister. I have to point out to those who are trying to decide if these stories are for them...if you have an open mind about open marriages, lesbianism and sadism then you won't have any problem reading these stories - and I say \\"these\\" because there are three books to the series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest..and read them in that order or you will be lost. You also get the feeling with the titles of these books that the author might have been a fan of Lillian Jackson Braun's \\"The Cat Who...\\" series; it would have been interesting to see how far he would have gone with \\"The Girl Who...\\" Anyway, definitely not books for Teens or Tweens or anyone younger, probably not for some adults, either...but if you are not too sensitive or prudish you will certainly enjoy The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (and the other two books, as well)
B0071QIN00|5.0|if you like the game Happy Wheels on computer then you'll probably enjoy this one.  The controls and level design are horrible, but the physics are hilarious and totally worth it.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This is seriously the best album =VH= has done in 30 years! I admit that I was very skeptical and afraid that it would suck because it took SO long for them to even release a snippet but now I know that it was all worth the wait. Every song sounds like classic =VH= and easily gets stuck in my head. Dave can't sing as high as he could 30 years ago but seriously, WHO CAN? At least he has the common sense to stay in his range and focus on his strengths. Alex sounds every bit as phenomenal and rocking as he did on \\"Hot For Teacher\\" and Eddie? Well, not only is his playing the best ever, he has his classic, fat tone back! The guitar just punches you in the gut on every song. But my favorite thing about this album is....<br /><br />The bass playing! I sincerely mean no disrespect to Michael Anthony because he seems like a real class act and a super nice guy but let's face it, he was ALWAYS the weakest link in this band. I always wondered what Van Halen would sound like with a bass player who was the same calibre as Eddie and Alex. Now we finally know! Wolfgang definitely has Van Halen DNA, the kid rocks. His bass lines have great hooks and groove exceptionally well with his uncle's drumming. And the backup vocals sound just like Van Halen. Don't forget, Eddie was half of that vocal sound. As far as I am concerned, THIS is the =VH= lineup that I have always dreamed of. The only other thing that I would have liked is an instrumental from Eddie, but other than that, this is a PERFECT Van Halen album.<br /><br />For all the haters who are giving this album 1 star, I bet you haven't even listened to it. I don't care about Chickenfoot but I would never go and give them 1 star just because I like Dave better. Grow up. :^)
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I took my wife to see this performance in London, yes, Phoenix to London to see a play and it was the greatest experience's in my life.  I have not seen the dvdbut just found out I can pre-order it. Best news of the new year for me.  When this play comes to the States we will going to as many openings as possible!!!  Buy the DVD and enjoy.  If you like Phantom of the Opera this is a must watch.  The performance is amazing and music is some of the best of ALW.  Till I Here You Sing, will tear you up it is beautiful.

B002BWP49C|5.0|This is by far the best movie of the series and for a first for me, my new very favorite movie.  This movie stayed closer to the book then the others and I thought it was great!!  Besides the actors, which I adore, the makeup artist was phenomenal!!  Billy Burke is heavily under-rated; he was great!!  The setting and backdrop was fantastic!!  I think Bill Condon will be in very high demand because of his ability to stay true to the writer's work and give it wonderful vision.  Very few other directors have this gift.  If you have read and enjoyed the books, this movie will ring truer for you than the others.  But I still like them too.

B000FCKBCU|5.0|One of my favorite books! Great for those of us that dream of escaping life and starting completely over. Very likable characters and a very sweet romance with  many funny parts to make you laugh.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|Monotone singer without original songwriting, resonation, intonation, range and evocative voice or stirring songwriting. Sounds like the same recycled generic and uninspiring R&B american idol renditions of what would have been effusive, heartfelt and introspective songs by ananis morrisette, st vincent, beachhouse or bjork. Don't feel any of the teenage angst that reviewers profess to be healing. Wish that in honor of Whitney Houston's evocative and inspiring voice we would have had an artist worthy of a Grammy.
B00190N4E4|5.0|The movie opens with Gandhi being shot and killed.  It really grabs your attention and leads you to wonder how this could happen to such a peaceful man.  It then goes on to show us the many issues that he truly fought to correct.  From having Indians carry papers in South Africa to the freeing of India, he never resorted to violence.  Even when he was harmed by others, he stood by and never seemed to lose his calm.  Gandhi was a firm believer of nonviolent protest and went as far as fasting until the violence was ended.  He was determined to see peace and if that meant starving himself to death, then that is what he was willing to do. He accepted the unjust that was happening and did not argue when sent to prison for his cause.  Gandhi created a living arrangement where no one was greater than anyone else.  He made sure to make it clear that he was still responsible for even the tasks that are considered lowly in the eyes of many.  Many of the beliefs that he held could really be used to influence those in the world today.  Gandhi was an amazing person, with a strong will to make a difference in his lifetime.  This movie relates to World Religions because it showcases many religions.  We witness his wife speaking of Hindu philosophy and also hear about the ceremony in which Gandhi married her when they were thirteen years old.  We also hear of the conflict between the Hindus and the Muslims once India becomes free, but divided.  During the course of the film, we see many religious practices.  One for instance is when they become enraged at the fact that an officer can just walk into a home and disrespect the woman of the household.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|Aha Believe is different than the previous 2 concerts. Shane (2006) and Powerscourt (2009) were outdoors and Believe is indoors. All three are brilliant. I think Shane and Powerscourt were very similiar so Believe is quite different which is good. The performers changed between each concert which obviously were caused by the contractual agreements. The Believe concert is full of music that is upbeat a bit from the other two concerts. All the performers over the years have been very angelic sounding and the latest concert is no different. The fiddler continues to be a joy to see and hear. Lisa K is off having another baby which is not the first time this has happened to the tour. David continues to pour his brilliance into the groups music in Atlanta as in the past. So yes their latest concert is different but not one ioda less in stunning enjoyment.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I've have been reading thru the New Testament (NKJV) and I have found some flaws. Mostly two words stuck together. However, in Acts, not only did I find two words stuck together, but in a few places, the first few words of some sentences were repeated. In Acts 16:18, the second half of the verse is missing. Those are the ones I noticed. So I have to wonder, what I may of missed. If they were to fix such issues, it would be a decent bible app.
0812992792|5.0|It's amazing how good this book is.  Totally unexpected, unheard of by me, but The Orphan Master's son is an intricate and clever masterpiece and I am so grateful for it.  I might turn around and read it again because the mind continues to make connections about the sprawling narrative and it's harrowing situations.  The writing is extremely vivid and it assumes different textures as the hero, Jun Do, struggles to learn his ever-changing context and overcome the fresh hell on earth that is North Korea.  His journey is so overwhelming that I am aching for Jun Do.  Many are in grief tonight for Whitney Houston and I am sad about that too.  Yet I grieve for Jun Do and I would probably feel better if I could sob for a little while.  Please don't run from this material.  Never has anything so grim been so interesting and revealing and well worth while.  Enjoy.
0439023521|2.0|Yep, boring. Admittedly, I'm 57 and I've been reading SF and fantasy since I was in first grade. Maybe I'm spoiled. But this book didn't truly engage me. The writing's flat. Reading it was like listening to someone reciting in a monotone. The characters aren't that interesting, the premise isn't that original, and there were only flickers of suspense. I'm glad I borrowed it, and didn't spend money on it! I'd much rather go re-read a book like Heinlein's [[ASIN:1416505512 Tunnel in the Sky]], which is a lot more suspenseful and fun.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I was so shocked to read such negative reviews for this cd before it even came out, especially from one female singer in particular who was pretty harsh when I thought she would be more sympathetic considering not everyone likes this person's musical style either. I won't mention her name but I went ahead and ordered the cd to make my own judgement. I, of course was familiar with Video Games, like everyone else but had not heard anything else.<br /><br />I think overall, the cd is pretty darn good. Born to Die~ love this song so much!!! I was cleaning out my spare bedroom and I had the cd playing on rotation. I couldn't get enough. Some of the lyrics are stuck in my head and can't get them out, it's that good. And that's another thing, the female singer whose name I didn't mention, her followers started to bash Lana Del Ray too and particularily the lyrics. Honestly, I didn't see anything wrong with them. I think they were pretty darn witty. Look at the song \\"Off to the Races\\", the line \\"light of my life, fire of my loins\\" is taken straight from the first sentence of Lolita. That is pretty freaking awesome to me to quote from classics of literature. Not many would get the reference. Read your classics people!<br /><br />I gave Lana Del Ray a chance and I'm happy I did. This cd is pretty great!

B004H7QICG|4.0|Generally well made case with a lot of nice features.  But keep in mind a few limitations, and consider the Antec P280 as well.  Limitation #1:  If you have a graphics card longer than about 10 inches, you'll have to remove the middle drive bay.  That means you lose the (2) upper drive bays.  Not only does that reduce total drive bays from (6) to (4), the upper bays are the only ones which natively support 2.5\\" SSDs.  You can still put the SSDs in any of the lower (4) bays, but you'll need a 2.5\\" to 3.5\\" adapter to do so.  Limitation #2:  If you have (2) 2.5\\" SSDs and want to put them in the upper bay (assuming your graphics card is short enough to keep those bays), you'll need to order an extra screw kit from Antec.  That's right, there are two bays with special silicone grommets that require special shoulder screws -- but Antec only supplies one set of screws with the case.  You can order another set from their web site for six bucks, including shipping.  Limitation #3:  Antec's prescribed method of connecting the front USB3 port is to run a cord from the front, out the back of the case, and plug it into one of your back-panel USB3 ports.  That looks pretty funky, and uses up one of your back-panel USB3 ports.  I solved this by getting a \\"Silverstone Tek 19 Pin USB 3.0 Adapter Cable - Internal to External (CP09)\\", about twelve bucks here on Amazon.  Plugged that into the motherboard USB header, then plugged the Antec front-panel cable into it.  Aside from those limitations, this is a really nice case and it is working well for me. My graphics card (nVidia GTX560ti) is under 9\\", so it fits just fine. But if you plan to use a longer card, look at the P280 case instead.  I did have to order the extra SSD screws and USB3 adapter, but considered those minor issues so still gave this case 4 stars.  But if these issues bother you, look at the P280 case instead.  So even though this case is working great for me, if I was ordering today I would look at the P280 instead. Itovercomes all of these limitations (two inches deeper so it can handle a 13\\" video card, uses standard screw mounts for 2.5\\" drives, and the USB3 front panel cable has a USB3 internal connector on it).  The price is nearly identical.  And the front-panel ports are conveniently located near the top, where they are much easier to access when the case is under a desk (where mine is).
0316017930|2.0|This book is more likely to inspire hopelessness than optimism.  If you're a smart person who has not been very successful to date,  it suggests that this is true because you didn't get the right breaks  and there's nothing you can do about it.  Some of his examples from the computer world may have had some  breaks, Gates more than Jobs, but more than anything I think they  deserve credit for seeing that something was possible and running  with their idea.  The Master Key by Charles Haanel, now more than 100 years old,  is more useful because it suggests that by applying your mind you  can be more, do more, and have more than you did in the past.  I have  such a high opinion of that book that I recorded all the chapters and  put them on Youtube.  <...>
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I was gifted this e-book by the author herself and at first, though I had committed to reading it, I wasn't sure that it was for me. Urban paranormal romance? I just didn't think I was going to enjoy it. I've tried other novels in this vein before, but to no success. However, as it turns out, I was happily proven wrong by \\"The Forever Girl\\" by Rebecca Hamilton.  I just finished it this morning and I am so pleased to review it!  This is the story of Sophia Parsons, a girl with a problem. She has a static in her head, like a white noise that she cannot clear. It has become more than a nuisance for her. It is way more than that. In fact, this curse leads her to investigate her family and she finds way more than she bargains for. Way more. I am careful about what I say because I don't want to spoil this book for anyone.  So let me break down why I liked \\"The Forever Girl\\"  -Characters: Rebecca Hamilton has a way with character. Many people completely blow first-person characterization. Not Ms. Hamilton. She seems to know her main character, Sofia, inside and out. As well, she seems to know that it is important to use the main character to get familiar and feel something for the other characters too. The chemistry between Sofia and Charles is fantastic and they seem to be real. This is the main thing I look for in novels. If I don't care about anybody, I will put it down quick.  -The History: There is quite a history in this novel and Ms. Hamilton has genuinely put some thought and research into what she has written. I typically think that flashbacks ruin a story, but Ms. Hamilton has made her flashbacks feel like flash forwards with their own story and an excitement all of their own. Fantastic!  -The Creatures: These creatures are so unique and unfathomably complex that you will wonder if this genre has not seen a revival. I literally could not believe how interesting these creatures are. Ms. Hamilton has taken the vampire genre and given an unusual shot in the arm, turning it into something almost unrecognizable and at the same time comfortably familiar.  -The Theme: One of the themes that found its way into this novel was that of acceptance and the evils of too much moral righteousness. There is nothing wrong with morality. However, there is something wrong with morality used as a baseball bat to club the life out of people. This book addresses this and I have to commend the writer on her themes.  Altogether, I cannot believe how much I enjoyed this book! I will be downloading the next book as soon as it comes out! Rebecca Hamilton has got another life long fan in me. She is an amazing person and a skilled, competent, and exciting author to read. I can't wait to see what she has in her pen for us next time!

B0049P1VHS|1.0|Trust me, I wanted to like this show.  I paid good money to buy the dvd set, having not seen the show previously on cable TV.  But I just couldn't get past the gazillion huge giant gaping gaps of logic (in the writing).  Spoiler alert hence forth:<br /><br />1) How does the main character, Grimes, end up in a COMA (for over a month!) from a gunshot to his ribcage?<br /><br />2) How does Grimes survive in a coma for what, several weeks, in a deserted hospital without any intake of water or food at all????  It had to be weeks without food or water, right?  Right?  Enough time for Grimes' best friend to start \\"doing\\" Grimes' wife--I assume she didn't just start having sex with the guy in just days.<br /><br />3) When Grimes heads to Atlanta to find his missing wife and son, why in hell would he abandon his police car for a horse!!!!?  Who the hell in their right mind would go horseback riding through a zombie infested landscape!?  And if he did find his wife and son while on horseback, how would all three ride on one horse?  And at the farm where he gets the horse, he doesn't even check the farm vehicles for gas? I mean, come on!  There's zero common sense given to the characters in this show!<br /><br />4) In Atlanta, Grimes ends up inside a tank surrounded by zombies and he never tries to start the tank!!??  I mean wouldn't you want to see if you could drive the tank to escape!?  Yet, he never even tries to start it.  Also, he's got a .50 caliber machine gun on top of the tank yet never thinks to try to use it to kill some of the zombies!<br /><br />5) The band of survivors that his son and wife are among AREN'T holed inside some defendable and secure location such as a bank, police station, prison or army base?  Instead, they're just OUTSIDE, unprotected, living in flimsy tents????  With no defenses beside a few strings of tin cans as a \\"warning.\\"  Ah, yeah, guess what?  They get attacked and a bunch of survivors get killed.  What would you expect living outside ina zombie infested area!!!!?<br /><br />6) The band of survivors \\"trapped\\" in the department store have been \\"surviving\\" against the zombies for a month, yet they're barely armed at all????  Just a handgun or two and a hunting rifle.  In this country there are over 300 million guns, more guns than there are people.  Ah, if you're fighting against hordes of zombies to survive, don't you think every survivor would have a crapload of guns and ammo???? And the blonde woman with the silver pistol doesn't even know how to use it!  She never even thought to ask anyone how to fire her gun!!!!????  AND... what's with their clothes?  Instead of tactical clothing or army-type fatigues, they wear things like fashionable and pretty silk blouses????  And none of them wear any anti-zombie protective gear to protect themselves against bites?  No police riot gear, no bulletproof vests, no thick motorcross pants or jackets or gloves or helmets?<br /><br />7) And the survivors vehicles consist of a broken down old motorhome and an open-air jeep!?  When they could easily get tanks, armored trucks, military HUMVEES, buses, or brand NEW motorhomes????  I mean, nearly everyone's dead, they can take or use whatever vehicle they want.<br /><br />8) And guns!!!!  In one episode a gang of Latinos and a group of survivors are set to kill each other over one lousy bag of handguns and shotguns when there's military machine guns just sitting in the streets???  And the survivors are content with arming themselves with crummy revolvers and pump action shotguns when then easily could and should be armed with assault rifles, Saiga shotguns and/or military weaponry???<br /><br />9) And the characters are always saying there's no gas?  When they're constantly coming across hundreds if not thousands of idle vehicles?  There's no gas in ANY of them!?  But how would they know?  There's not one scene of any character checking a vehicle to see if it has gas in its tank!<br /><br />Honestly, it seems ZERO thought was put into writing this show from a stand point of logic.  The writers obviously didn't get into the minds of the characters or the situations they face and consequently there's NO plausibility to the character's actions in most scenes.  Too bad, because this could have been a good show--it's a good premise.  But it's just too poorly written to be truly entertaining.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Matt Reeves' \\"Let Me In,\\" an American version of a Swedish film (English title, \\"Let the Right One In\\"), succeeds brilliantly where so many American reworkings of European films fail.  Far from a pale retread or an empty star vehicle, \\"Let Me In\\" may be the most intelligent and thought-provoking vampire movie ever.  The film is set in Los Alamos, New Mexico, in the early 1980s.  Not only does the name \\"Los Alamos\\" set an ominous tone from the outset, but the time period is a good one for alienation and abandonment (as well as some pretty good tunes on the soundtrack).  Divorce was growing more and more common, but it was still one of those issues that carried a fair weight of shame.  Naturally, our hero is a kind, meek boy named Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee of \\"The Road\\") whose parents are divorcing.  Owen's mother appears to be the short straw in the broken marriage as she's a bit of a religious nut who drowns her agony in wine before she falls asleep on the couch.  Owen's dad seems decent, but he never gets closer to Owen than a concerned phone call.  Owen is alone in a cold world.  Friendless and an only child, he's bullied at school by three bigger boys.  The bullying scenes are handled extremely well - they are just as uncomfortable and riveting as the more bloody action scenes the movie has in store.  Alone, that is, until the mysterious Abby arrives.  Abby (Chloe Moretz) is either attractively mysterious or mysteriously attractive - she walks through the snow without shoes and doesn't get cold.  Her melancholy dad (Richard Jenkins) is a melancholy, tortured soul, for reasons the movie makes painfully clear.  Jenkins, one of our most under-rated actors, does a magnificent job with his few lines, including his weighty admonition to Abby, \\"Please stay away from that boy.\\"  Owen eventually learns that Abby is a vampire, but he doesn't care - she is kind to him. In a weaker movie, Abby would become Owen's guardian angel, dispensing comeuppances and one-liners while allowing Owen to become his school's alpha dog.  \\"Let Me In\\" has another message - there is a high price to be paid for being a vampire's friend.  Indeed, Abby's dad really isn't her dad, but instead someone who knows all too well what's in store for Owen should he get too close to Abby.  Violent without being a bloodfest, scary without resorting to the \\"jump-out-from-behind-the-door\\" cliches that the \\"Scream\\" franchise mocked so well, \\"Let Me In\\" is a true horror movie.  The movie's final scene, innocent enough on its face, sends chills down your spine as you realize the lifetime of horrors that await.  It's not perfect, but after the years of \\"Buffy,\\" \\"Twilight,\\" and other campy vampire stuff \\"Let Me In\\" represents a triumphant return of horror to the vampire genre.

B006G2ZEV6|5.0|I spend a lot of time, sometimes hours, reviewing every game I download before I commit to any purchase, regardless of the price. I have been waiting patiently for months hoping Anomaly Warzone Earth would lower it's price. My wait paid off. I can honestly tell you that this game is well worth the full price, but the $1.99 price point was a nice gift. This game is absolutely beautiful to look at. The detail put into this production is amazing. Clearly one of the Top 3 games I own, and I have tried a hundred of them. I won't bore you with the details of the game play, since there is enough detail on that already, but I just wanted to point out how emersive the world of Anomaly is for being a tower defense game. I hope 11 bit studios is working on a sequel to this game, because it is truly amazing. Many people might not know this but this game was runner up on the Best of Mac Apple Store 2011 Game of the Year list. Tower defense games may not be for everyone, but for those who love this type of strategy gameplay, you'll find none better than Anomaly Warzone Earth.

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I had heard some good things about this movie, and now I can consent with the majority. This was just a really fun movie! Is it realistic? No, not really, but that doesn't mean it's not capable of giving you joy from watching it. Just like in Rocky, you have an underdog that comes from humble beginnings to rise to a place of prominence, success, and fame. I really didn't expect to get so excited cheering for the heroes of this movie, but more than once I found myself throwing a couple of fist pumps! When a movie gets you to do that, it has clearly succeeded in engaging its audience! Lots of fun, and relatively clean for a PG-13 movie. You've got a couple swear words thrown in here and there, but no blood, no sex, and most of the violence consists of CGI-animated robots beating the snot out of one another. I'd definitely recommend this movie!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I've seen three adaptations of Emma, the 1996 version with Gwyneth Paltrow, the 1997 TV adaptation with Kate Beckinsale and finally this one, starring Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller. This one is in my opinion the absolute best by far, especially if you read and enjoyed the book, but it isn't your favorite Austen novel. By that I mean that this adaptation manages to stay mostly faithful to the events and characters of the novel, while making some welcome \\"improvements\\" that are very much in keeping with the spirit of the book.  The leisurely pace of this film (actually a four part miniseries) allows for more exploration of the real motivations of the characters. At the risk of being horsewhipped by some Austen lovers this may even improve on the book. For example, Mr. Woodhouse's (wonderfully portrayed here by Michael Gambon) well known valetudinarianism retains its light humor as in the book, but gains a touch of pathos by the film gently reminding us that his wife's death was sudden and traumatic and that his light tyranny about illness and diet and travel comes from love rather than self occupation. Miss Bates (played by Tamsin Grieg) also enjoys this treatment, showing us not just the silly chatterbox spinster, but also the very real sadness and loneliness of the \\"gentlewoman of reduced circumstances\\" we so often contend with in period pieces. Even our understanding of Frank Churchill's (Rupert Evans) careless bad-boy-with-a-good-heart antics are broadened by the subtle suggestion that he might be just a little angry that he was sent away by his father all those years ago.  Romola Garai is completely charming as the slightly spoiled and conceited Emma, but she adds a touch of naïveté and impetuousness to the character to keep her relatable and endearing. Contrast this with Paltrow's portrayal of the character as a sophisticated, politic, social adept in the 1996 adaptation and it's easy to see why Garai's version of the character is so much more lovable. She's so much more human. Similarly, Emma is rendered much more sympathetic by this version's suggestion that her life, while seemingly charmed, has shortcomings and that her misguided matchmaking is not just about her vanity but also an attempt to deflect her own attention from the isolation and boredom she feels as a motherless girl taking care of an elderly father. Plus the added but somewhat shallow bonus of Garai being absolutely lovely to look at doesn't hurt.  Jonny Lee Miller is a revelation as Mr. George Knightley, family friend, neighbor, and the brother of Emma's brother in law. Miller injects tremendous humor and personality into a character that can prove somewhat of a conundrum for modern readers/viewers. Knightley is reinvented from the rather tame, somewhat prematurely middle aged gentleman of the novel into an intelligent, slightly unconventional, independent thinker, making for a much more interesting and engaging character. He plays Knightley as rather in love (though perhaps subconsciously) with Emma from the start, which makes his scolding of her seem less creepily paternalistic and more lovingly done in the service of someone he deeply cares about. And while Miller is just the right age for the part, his portrayal of Knightley with quite a bit of youthful vitality and physicality makes Emma's attraction to a man 16 years older than her much more plausible, and dare I say, much less disturbing. (In fact he was 37 when the production was filmed, the exact same age as the character in the novel, which is why I don't understand the contention by some that he was too young for the part.) Miller excels at the humorous side of Mr. Knightley, indeed, even in scenes where he doesn't have many lines, his facial expressions are enough to make you laugh out loud. Watch him closely during the first dinner party scene where Mr. Elton arrives late, and the scene where Miss Bates comes to Hartfield to deliver the news that Mr. Elton is getting married, to see what I mean. Overall this incarnation of Mr. Knightley is the best yet, in my opinion. Infinitely preferable to the reserved and almost cold Mr. Knightley played by Mark Strong in the 1997 adaptation, and even a bit better than the very capable and attractive Jeremy Northam in the 1996 adaptation.  There's great chemistry between Miller and Garai, and their verbal sparring is exhilarating. On the one hand it's comical because they both so clearly feel that they are the expert on everything, and also a bit sexy by way of the aforementioned chemistry and because this was surely what made for flirtation between clever people in the Regency period. Every zinger they throw at each other is foreplay.  The cast is rounded out admirably by Jodhi May as a surprisingly young Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston, Robert Bathurst as the amiable Mr. Weston, Louise Dylan as the hapless Harriet Smith, Blake Ritson as the handsome but pompous Mr. Elton, Poppy Miller as Isabella Knightley (formerly Woodhouse), Dan Fredenburgh as Mr. John Knightley, Laura Pyper as the talented but sad Jane Fairfax, and Christina Cole as the obnoxiously haughty Mrs. Elton. In particular, Dan Fredenburgh as John Knightley was quite enjoyable even though he has very few scenes. He plays Mr. Knightley's slightly less agreeable brother to great comic effect, and yet gives the suggestion by his mannerisms and sense of humor that he and Miller's Mr. Knightley really are related. You actually feel that these are two characters who might have grown up in the same household. Whether this was by design or purely a happy accident is unclear, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.  Overall, a very fine adaptation, not to be missed among devotees of Austen or lovers of period dramas.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We received the original Perplexus as a gift, and both of my kids were enthralled. My 8 year old wanted to buy the epic after solving the original. Both have enjoyed the Epic as much as the original, though it is more difficult. They come back to it for more play. It comes with a cool stand so it doesn't just roll around the playroom. Great as a gift or as a toy.

0545265355|5.0|Easy read.... I LOVED the trilogy! From the 1st chapter I was hooked and read all 3 straight through. I could not read them fast enough. I was satisfied from start to THE END. Great books for teens, looking forward to the movie. I'm passing my set around to all my friends encouraging them to read. Wish there were more books in the series.
B000JML7EC|5.0|Excellent book. Good example for someone wanting to write a book. It is hard to believe Robert Louis Stevenson published this in 1883. It has suspense and mystery, adventure, and the excellent use of point of view would work for today's novels. I believe the author cleverly moved the main narrator, Jim Hawkins, from one group to another to have first hand point of view. Only once did point of view switch to the doctor. Stevenson also let Jim overhear the pirates in a way to know what was going on. I finished reading it while on vacation in St. Thomas Virgin Islands, not far from where the model for Treasure Island is supposed to be.

I can see trying to get the point across that he is quiet and keeps to himself, but really?  Anyway the movie moved along pretty well, there is alot of violence so prepare yourself.  I think we were expecting more of a car chase kind of movie with an over the top main character.  It was a lot of driving and chasing but the movie was just different from any other action movie. I guess you could say action movie with in depth study of the human character.

B004LWZW24|4.0|I saw the teaser poster for a movie called Insidious. The artwork reminded me of a Children of the Damned poster and had what appeared to be a possessed child standing in front of a house. The movie began and I learned about a young couple Patrick Wilson (Josh) and Rose Byrne (Renai) who had a young son  Ty Simpkons (Dalton) and a newborn baby.<br /><br />A few over imposing spirits have apparently haunted the house. Ghostly children play records and skip throughout the house laughing. A very large man paces back and forth anxiously about the porch. Demonic figures stalk the nighttime world. The couple's newborn baby cries for no apparent reason... A devilish voice can be heard screaming behind the baby's cry from a baby monitor. As the attacks and haunting grow stronger, Renai pleads and then eventually begs for her husband Josh to move her and the family out and away from the cursed home. The family moves and quickly discovers that this house is apparently haunted as well and the little boy slips into a deep coma. Renai calls a team of Paranormal Research Experts to investigate the haunted happenings.<br /><br />Two men enter the home and the ghost hunting does begin. As the two men are apparently humoring the victims by \\"Ghost Busting\\" the house with the equivalent of a \\"Fuzz Buster\\" the team soon realize that a more experienced teammate must be called. Elise, the teams channel-er, psychic and clairvoyant notes that there appears to be an insidious force who want to crawl inside the body of their young son. The father rejects the possibility of the fact that his house is not the thing that's haunted; it is his son. Further research of the boy's room and artwork drawn by the boy would then conglomerate this possibility very strongly and thus the team of paranormal experts along with the boy's parents will have to descend into a world of darkness from the dream world where the little boy has been trapped due to his uncanny ability to \\"Astrally Travel\\".<br /><br />Insidious is a movie that reminds me of several movies all in one: Poltergeist, Paranormal Activity, Wes Cravens New Nightmare and a slew of others. Insidious also has a few elements that remind me of the video game Fatal Frame. I was pleasantly surprised to find out just how spooky and chilling the movie actually was and found myself not only glued to my seat but also jumping from fright along the way. Quick ghastly images and disturbing concepts makes this movie my top-horror pick so far for 2011. I highly recommend this movie for any horror fan or for anyone wanting a good old-fashioned scare.  No real gore or excessive killing here and that is what makes this a movie that will probably have you saying, \\"They Just don't make movies like this anymore\\". Insidious is not fun for the whole family and is rated PG-13 for a very good reason. Insidious is definitely the stuff that nightmares are made of.<br /><br />The Cast:<br />Patrick Wilson - Josh Lambert Rose Byrne - Renai Lambert Lin Shaye - Elise Rainier Ty Simpkins - Dalton Lambert Angus Sampson - Tucker Barbara Hershey - Lorraine Lambert Andrew Astor - Foster Lambert Corbett Tuck - Nurse Adele Heather Tocquigny - Nurse Kelly Ruben Pla - Dr. Sercarz John Henry Binder - Father Martin Joseph Bishara - Lipstick-Face Demon Philip Friedman - Old Woman J.

B006E4QCXU|4.0|This app is definitely worth downloading when it pops up as a special free application of the day. Colorful and entertaining, you can move about thousands of little pixels as though they were glowing sands. Supposed to be stars in the sky, they move about in all kinds of ways when you touch the screen. You can customize colors, including what they start out as, what they end up as after moving and what color they are while still in movement. It's amazing how memorizing it can be, and you can easily lose 10 or 20 minutes of time just playing around with it. But eventually is will get old and you wont use it often, so I would say definitely get it if you have a chance to get it for free. But the entertainment value of it may be too short lived to want to pay much for it.
B0068MNO4S|2.0|This review is on the movie itself and contains spoilers:  I recently watched the film and tried to judge it on its own merits and not on what I've read about Elizabethan history and it has to be one of the more unintentionally funny movies of the past year. Rafe Spall was great as this buffoonish Shakespeare. There should have been more of him for intended laughs but he provided plenty of unintended laughs as well.  **The guy is depicted as this vain actor that we never see on stage. Exactly what was his position in the theater company prior to \\"becoming a writer\\" is never clear. The fact that he is such an idiot but apparently is listened to by those who run a business venture.  **Shakespeare is depicted as being so full of himself that he's a sniveling twit but yet he apparently can kill Marlowe without any thought. He's an idiot but yet he's dangerous. You can do that but you have to SHOW the dangerous side at some point.  **Again Shakespeare, the low life, is apparently able to blackmail an earl who lives in London and is probably active in the court. Why wouldn't De Vere just have him killed or imprisoned on some trumped up charge, especially if he can get Jonson out of jail for sedition. How does Shakespeare even get to see the earl in the first place? There is such a big deal made by Oxfordians about Will not having access to the nobility, yet in the movie he can see one whenever he wants.  Other unintentional laughs:  **The crowd seeing a few minutes of \\"Richard III\\" and then start yelling \\"Essex, Essex\\" and storming out of the theater. The parodying of Cecil's son was obvious but where did the audience get the idea to storm the palace yelling \\"Essex\\"? How did they make that connection? Why not yell \\"Steve\\", it would make as much sense? Apparently, you'll never be able to watch the first few minutes of \\"Richard III\\" without thinking of \\"Essex\\" and starting a riot. And why would you leave so early? I don't know about you but I paid to get into this new show,I want to see it.`  **The \\"Its a trap\\" scene with the repeat fire muskets speaks for itself in the hysterical absurdity.  **Older Queen Elizabeth is demented out of her mind AND then she's not.  **The holding of her funeral on the frozen river. Regardless of how cold/frozen it was, would you really hold a state funeral on water and if its that cold why be outside in the first place?  **Eddie \\"gotta keep my writing a secret\\" De Vere making a big deal about being secret while the Cecils and the Queen know that its him all the time. There's never any discovery.  \\"Father, you're being parodied on stage in 'Hamlet'!\\"  \\"Oh that's just Edward at that devilish writing again.\\"  **Jonson disappears from the film for the length of a bible and then reappears at the end carrying on about how wonderful De Vere is. When exactly did they have time to foster such a close relationship? How about one scene where the two writers talk shop, inspirations, something in common for their calling?  **Making a big deal about \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" being written all in blank verse and then somebody saying that is not totally in verse. Oh, I guess then it wasn't such a big deal after all and Eddie lied about it being all in verse. I wondered what else he lied about?  **Ah incest...  **Filming scenes in dark locations. Yes, Emmrich, we understand there was no electrical lighting back then but it would be nice to actually see the actor's faces. Other period films don't seem to have an issue.  **Probably the worst joke of all, Derek Jacobi reviving his role of Chorus from Branagh's \\"Henry V\\". A modern dress narrator that starts out the movie in a theater. Also, no applause from the audience in the theater at the end of the film.  And the list goes on and on...  Regardless of the above I do think you could make an interesting narrative in DeVere's life although you would have to compromise part of the Theory. Is he the son of Elizabeth or lover - pick one and explore it for the juicy stuff that it would be. Shakespeare has to be literate and not a moron or he is, pick one. Rhys Ifans is actually very good in the role and if he was given a chance to be the actual protagonist with scenes that involved character development he would have been much more believable and sympathetic. To call the Cecils villains is too simplistic. As a villain Elmer Fudd has more motivation and character depth than these guys. The costumes and set designs are good although its been done far better in other films. Overall there are some good actors, what could have a good story but its poorly written, poorly directed, poorly shot and unintentionally funny but I guess that's what we can expect from the Oxfordian theory.

1853287563|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moZEHIA1XHJDBY]]<br /><br />HERE'S A MARKETING LAW RESOURCE<br />FOR LAW PRACTITIONERS- NOW AVAILABLE FROM THE LAW SOCIETY<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This firm needs more business.  How do we bring it on?  What are the options?<br /><br />If you run or manage a law practice and you're looking for the answers to questions like these, you need this book. The authors, David Monk and Alistair Moyes are experienced marketing consultants and, granted, there are a lot of those about.  But there aren't many, you may have noticed, who really understand the legal profession.  So it's both rare and reassuring that the two authors are joint directors of the aptly named Marketlaw Ltd, bringing with them a total of thirty years' experience in marketing legal services.  It's also reassuring that the book is published by Law Society Publishing and therefore targeted directly at the needs of its members.<br /><br />The purpose of marketing is of course, to bring in more business, and boost profitability. While these are the aims of any business, law practices in particular need to be a little more selective and subtle in their marketing activities than say, retailers or distributors of consumer goods.  As Law Society President, John Wotton, points out in the Foreword: `the introduction of alternative business structures (ABS) early next year has the potential to introduce greater competition to what is already a crowded market.  ABS, say the authors, will be the major change in the legal profession.  But what will not change is `the need for practices...to top up their marketing and compete' - which this book certainly tells you how to do.<br /><br />With its accompanying CD ROM, the book aims to help you thrive in the current challenging climate that will continue to develop in the wake of the Legal Services Act 2007.  Taking a purely practical approach (thank goodness) this handy paperback volume covers a wide range of marketing principles and activities, from traditional marketing (advertising, direct mailings and PR), to raising your visibility on social networks, to developing your client mailing list into a true CRM (customer [or client] relationship management) database via a `client registration scheme.'<br /><br />If all this is beginning to sound a bit much, have a look at the section on specific campaigns which focuses on `appointing a PR or advertising agency' and `getting the best out of consultants.'  Whether you decide to do your own marketing (and you can) or appoint expert consultants if you have the budget, this book, with its wealth of excellent advice,  will introduce you to basic principles and best practice which can only help your business grow.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of other marketing tomes you may have come across, this one, published 2011, is bang up to date.  For your further research, there's a short bibliography at the back and a usefully detailed index to guide you as an excellent, additional marketing resource for your practice as ABSs are introduced., from traditional marketing (advertising, direct mailings and PR), to raising your visibility on social networks, to developing your client mailing list into a true CRM (customer [or client] relationship management) database via a `client registration scheme.'

B00319ECGK|5.0|I watched this very soon after it hit the cinemas in the Netherlands.I was very impressed.Not only was it a thoughtprovoking movie , it was also an action movie.The Wachowski brothers would later do this again with V for Vendetta.Back then it had its share of controversy particularly the shooting in the main hall and both Neo and Trinity in leather trenchcoats.Some people saw a connection in this with the Columbine shooting but is has nothing to do with that.The picture quality of the Blu-Ray is excellent,i keep discovering new details , sound was also very good although i would have preferred DTS.If you want to buy a very good movie on Blu-Ray this is The One.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I liked this album because she sounds nothing like Lady Gaga or Katy Perry or Rihanna (same reason I like Adele). Gaga, Perry, Rihanna and the like are just ANNOYING and their songs all sound the same. Lana's album is just different. I actually listened to it all the way through (I don't normally do that). The production is fantastic if nothing else, and the songs are catchy, although some are pretty slow. I think one reviewer said it earlier but I agree - she reminds me of Fiona Apple. \\"Born to Die\\" is my favorite one and \\"Video Games\\" is second. Enjoy! =)

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This is one of the rare cases where the film is actually BETTER than the book. I recommend seeing this even if you've read the book. I have and I've enjoyed it even knowing how it will end.  The movie adds a lot to the experience, but mainly it conveys very well the dark atmosphere of the hard cold winter of northern Sweden and specifically the isolation of the island where this movie main plot is located. The excellent soundtrack from Trent Reznor adds to this as well (the cover to Led Zeppelin's Immegrant Song is stunning!). Also, I think the screen version if much better and more focused on the main storyline, leaving out some details that I thought were a little tedious when reading this book.

B004A8ZWW4|3.0|This movie had an interesting premise and decent special effects, but all was ruined by a ham-fisted screenplay and poor direction.  Jackman was so relentlessly clueless that it was impossible to take him seriously enough for the emotional story to register.  I don't demand that everything be perfectly logical in a movie like this, but there's a difference between the illogic that is the result of a fanciful story and the illogic born of incompetent writing.  The movie lost me near the beginning, when [* mild spoiler *] Jackman's hardships resulted from things like putting everything on the line in big robot fights and then not reading the instruction manual, or looking away from the action when a 2,000 pound bull is charging his robot in the arena. The obstacles put in Jackman's path were so predictable that there are many eye-rolling moments as the story unfolds, and the big finish was simply lacking in imagination or emotional impact. There were mildly entertaining moments, and the main robot character was well done. The young boy did a pretty good job, as did the woman who played Jackman's love interest. All in all, a wasted opportunity to make a much better movie.
0385344228|3.0|From the first page of this book I was drawn into the story line. This book is a real page turner and I found myself drawn to reading for long periods of time. My only problem with this novel was that at times the author was bogged down in details and took too long getting to the point. The other does do a good job of dealing with emotional strain that the trial has on the family and those that are involved in their lives. Overall it is a decent novel that could have been improved upon with slightly less detail and a little more of getting to the point.

I am so used to hearing these songs done by Sinatra. These are done so well, and tastefully. I can't believe anyone will be disappointed.

B003Y5H54W|3.0|I'd love to say that in person to the beautiful Amanda Seyfried who has tremendous blue peepers. She plays the girl in the long red cape in this reimagining of the old children's fairy tale.<br /><br />Seyfried always has the ability to improve the quality of whatever film she's in, and RED RIDING HOOD is no exception. This film draws so heavily on the TWILIGHT franchise that it might as well BE an installment of TWILIGHT, (\\"TWILIGHT: THE ANCIENT BEGINNING\\") but despite the derivative nature of the film (with its teenage love triangle and werewolf), RED RIDING HOOD does shine with its own dark light.<br /><br />Much of it is due to the set design and cinematography. Its fairy tale-cum nightmare universe is filled with a forest of trees spouting sharp spikes. The architecture of RED RIDING HOOD's village likewise is festooned with spikes. The village is in a remote valley surrounded by sharp-peaked mountains, somewhere, presumably in the Europe of the Dark Ages. It is winter, cold and dark. The villagers practice a kind of Christianity-tinged paganism. Belief in werewolves, witches and magic is universal. When a long-gone werewolf reappears, the villagers hunt it and kill A large wolf. The wolf-slaying brings on an orgiastic rite of drunkenness, lewd dancing, sex, and the immolation of a Burning Man figure.<br /><br />In the midst of all this revelry, the mysterious Father Solomon appears (Gary Oldman in appropriately evil form) telling the villagers that what they have killed is merely a wolf and not a werewolf. A Fearless Werewolf Hunter, Fr. Solomon is also a zealot who killed his own wife for being a lycanthrope---a human able to assume the form of a wolf. Like most Inquisitors, he takes far too much enjoyment in torturing the villagers, one of which, he asserts, is the werewolf. What follows is a literal witch-hunt as the frightened villagers turn on each other to avoid Fr. Solomon's diabolical torture machines.<br /><br />Enter Red Riding Hood. The pretty village girl, Valerie by name, was given her moniker because she wears a long red cape made for her by her kindly but eccentric Grandma (Julie Christie) who lives far outside the village walls. What isn't generally known is that Valerie can speak with the werewolf. When Fr. Solomon discovers this (through torture, of course) he sets Valerie out as a Judas Goat to lure the wolf who wants to claim Valerie for its own.<br /><br />While there isn't much overt sexuality in RED RIDING HOOD, there is a tremendous amount of sexual symbolism. The blonde Seyfried is dressed in lavender with her red cape flowing behind her. Set against the whiteness of the snows, it suggests---practically screams---the end of innocence. \\"Put on your harlot's robe!\\" Fr. Solomon orders as he leaves her as bait for the werewolf.<br /><br />Likewise, the lavender underdress is matched by Fr. Solomon's violet robes: They both share a secret knowledge. Even Seyfried's relationship to the werewolf is rife with sexual symbolism: the lycanthrope, whether as human or wolf, wants to possess her, not kill her.<br /><br />Films often reflect the time in which they were made, and RED RIDING HOOD certainly does. The xenophobia of the villagers and their consuming fear are hallmarks of our own time. The obsession with innocence, purity, and values has become an increasingly intense---and frightening---element in our society, where we are revisiting issues as mundane as contraception.<br /><br />In the end, though, it is Amanda Seyfried with her quiet talent, who manages, yet again, to imbue this film with more quality than it would otherwise have.moniker because she wears a long red cape made for her by her kindly but eccentric Grandma (Julie Christie) who lives far outside the village walls.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|If you're new to Adele you may be wondering which cd to buy.<br /><br />Recently, traveling overseas in the UK and Ireland, every house I visited seemed to have an Adele cd, usually belonging to a teenage girl or young lady. When I inquired further, nobody had anything but good to say about her. Even parents like her.<br /><br />Upon my return I bought 21 never having listened to an Adele song. By the time I got home from the record store I had listened to most of the album, and immediately ordered her other album 19.<br /><br />On youtube you may discover a Saturday night live skit about her song Someone Like you where cast members broke into tears when they heard this song. So later when I watched her on video, I had quite a strong emotional reaction to it, which is unusual.<br /><br />If one talks about Adele either a flattering comparative or a superlative might be in order.<br /><br />Not since the Beatles has an artist had two top five singles and albums in the UK charts simultaneously. Not since Madonna has a female artist held the number one position in the charts for 12 weeks consecutively before Adele with 21. In the Uk it's the bestselling album of the century so far beating Amy Winehouse's Back to Black. Six million recoreds sold in the USA in 2011,  231 million views of Rolling in the Deep on youtube. Her previous album 19 sold more than 5 million copies. She has sold more than 4.1 million copies of 21 in Britain alone.  Now she has 6 grammy nominations winning 6, including Song of the Year for Rolling in the Deep, and Best Album for 21.<br /><br />Called 21 because that's how old she was when she wrote it. Several songs including Someone Like You and Turn The Tables are relationship driven pieces, inspired by an ex boyfriend, who broke her heart and inspired her art. The major hits are Someone Like You, and Rolling in the deep, although I find all the songs to be high quality. I have been listening to this album in the car, and only this album for about two weeks, and never pressed the skip button once.<br /><br />In interviews, refreshing and down to earth. Asked on Chelsea Lately about her ex boyfriend, she said: 'I believe he's living in a shabby apartment in London. I am staying in a very nice hotel around the corner.'<br /><br />Rarely have I experienced a singer who grabs your nervous system and drags you into her emotional world. At once she manages to sound both modern and retro. This album is very well produced, and in addition to her voice, we have great instrumentation with catchy piano fills and intriguing backing vocals from female singers, even a brass section on some tracks. If she reminds me of anyone it's Dusty Springfield, Son of a Preacher Man, but she is distinctly Adele..<br /><br />My only concern for Adele is her vocal issues, surgery with bleeding vocal cords, canceling her American tour. Having undertaken vocal training for several years, I know of several great singers who have lost their voices through flawed technique or overdoing it, the obvious example being Julie Andrews, so she needs to follow a proven successful method adopted by many successful singers, such as the speech level singing method which will protect and nurture her voice. It would be a tragedy if someone as talented as Adele was lost ot the world because of what would be preventable issues.<br /><br />If you are wondering whether 19 or 21 is better, get 21 first. Her voice is better. The song quality is better overall, the production values are superior. On 21 all the songs are good, and some of the songs are great. Not to say that 19 is not good, just that 21 is better. I love the energy of Rumor Has It, and also Turn The Tables, and Someone Like You is an iconic relatable anthem to lost love. I also love Rolling in the deep.<br /><br />One thing that intrigues me about her songwriting is her figures of speech, whether it is the metaphor of turning the tables or can you imagine what it's like to chase pavements, andcan you really hit someone with your cold shoulder?<br /><br />I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.
B004SQS9FA|5.0|For me this is an easy 5-star album, despite the short duration. I am happy buying and listening to a handful of well crafted tracks than a long album of garbage and filler. If anything else, it leave me wanting more every time I listen to it - a sign of a great work of art in my opinion. Some have eluted to the album being a pieced together collection, and uncoordinated grouping of tracks, and that somehow this diminishes the quality of the songs or even the effort behind the music. Tisk, Tisk; I implore you to watch The King of Limbs live performance on Palladia ( at least on Comcast in my area). I see a band with tremendous dedication to the music; Thom Yorke really puts himself out there with several tracks. No not the whaling falsetto that he displays in many of the band's distinguishing songs, but there is more to music than high notes. The tracks on The King of Limbs have depth, cohesion, and still carry a characteristic Radiohead sound. There is more to the music than what you see on the surface - and for me this is the defining Radiohead sound.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This much anticipated album is absolutely AWESOME! Each day it seems that I have yet another favorite song. Eddie just rips throughout the entire album and has reclaimed the throne as the guitar god he always was! Wolf is amazing on bass, Alex is stellar as always on drums, and it is SO NICE to have clever lyrics again with great messages from DLR!  Love, Love, Love this album! Get it if you don't have it already!  Peace...

B000H5TVKI|2.0|It wasn't what I expected when I got this movie on Blu Ray. Because of the fact that there's lots of greenery in this movie, it doesn't mesh very well. Case in point would be the ravine where they were chasing Rambo with the helicopter. The brush was literally blurred as the camera panned thru the valley. Most of the action as the sheriff posse ran thru the forest was blurred also. Yes, my motion settings were set just fine. In fact, I tried adjusting it on the fly and it didn't help. My other Blu Ray's look really good. This one did not... which is disappointing because this was a great movie.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|A wonderful first season for viewing. Hadn't had the opportunity to watch any of the episodes until my purchase. Great show! Couldn't get enough of it. Sadly, moved too quickly through the season. Now, anxiously awaiting receipt of the complete second season. Terrific acting with a superb plot.
B00119ZMOS|2.0|This was better than the first half.  McKay was a spot of humor the show desperately needed, but not sufficient.  Ryac and O'Neill saved the day.  That's the problem.  Just another tedious victory.

B000Y7U98W|1.0|1. They have Star Trek type artificial gravity on their ship!<br />2. What is the purpose of those sun shield louvres that are so important to the story? No purpose, at all.<br />3. Why is there a massive, all consuming fire in hydroponics? There is NO combustible material in hydroponics!<br />4. Why put out the fire in hydroponics with precious LOTS of water.<br />5. What is the purpose of going back to Icarus 1? Who was going to pilot the ship? Who was going to initiate detonation?<br />6. Why is the physics expert the ONLY person who can detonate the device? In such a mission everyone is cross-trained!<br />7. Where did all the dust come from on Icarus 1? Not enough dead crew to account for all the dust.<br />8. Why was the hydroponics flora in such profuse glory on Icarus 1? With no light and in total darkness?<br />9. Why use a giant wrench to repair the computer in the coolant room?<br />10. There was broken glass all over hydroponics after the fire. Glass is an absolute NO-NO inside a space station.<br />11. The computer on Icarus 2 should have alerted the programmer about the 1.5 degree off-set.<br />12. The sub-plot about not enough oxygen for the crew is hogwash. The amount of enclosed space was massive on this station!<br />13. Why is radio beacon/transmitter #1 rotating on a massive shaft? Looks nice, I guess.<br />14. When the physcisist becomes aware of a 5'th and possibly hostile entity on his ship, what does he do? He goes to see<br />who or what it is BY HIMSELF! No human being would do such a thing. You would alert your crew members first and then....<br />15. You cannot \\"sail\\" serenely towards the sun like they did! The increasing gravitational pull of the sun would accelerate<br />such a massive and frail ship to destruction.<br />16. Realistically speaking, humans would not be able to endure such a long mission. They would end up killing each other.<br />17. Why isn't there a medic umong the crew?<br />18. You cannot restart a sun with a nuclearexplosion! The only thing that can do that is to add more mass for fusion to occur.<br />19. Why does the crew consist of only 2 women to 6 men? On such a long mission it would be an equal split for obvious reasons.<br />20. The command structure is all wrong here. The captain is the one who makes the final descision as to whether or not to go to Icarus 1, and not the physcist.<br />21. How is it possible to view the Sun from the \\"observation\\" room like they do? It implies a direct line of sight. This is clearly impossible. Everything is behind the giant sun shield. The window material would melt. Look what happened to the captain in his space suit and the transmitter.<br />22.....I could go on.....<br /><br />I was going to ignore \\"1\\" and just enjoy the movie if that were the only inanity.

B00526ZKYS|4.0|Delirium by Lauren Oliver is a young adult dystopian where people live in fear of, and receive the cure to protect them from Amor Deliria Nervosa which roughly translates to mean \\"love\\". Oliver delivers a beautifully written tale of love, fear, and the consequences of a world without love.<br /><br />The United States has closed its borders, no one goes in and no one gets out. The citizens have all been relocated to sanctioned areas. We know that all of this occurred after the blitz. (We aren't sure what or why it happened) At the age of eighteen, citizens are inoculated against the disease known as Amor Deliria Nervosa. (Love). This disease is believed to be the root of all that went wrong with society. Young man and woman are tested prior to the vaccination. These tests determine their schooling, careers, and give them four perspective mates to choose from. All of this enforces the government's motto of \\"Safety, Health and Community.\\"<br /><br />When we are introduced to the protagonist, Magdalena \\"Lena\\" Haloway, she is counting down the days till her procedure. She is living in a sanctioned area in Portland, Maine. She lives with her aunt, uncle and nieces. Her mother suffered from the disease and died, nearly ten years ago. She attends an all girl's school, as children are segregated until after they are given the cure. Side effects prevent anyone from being cured until they are eighteen. Lena lives in fear of becoming like her mother and is afraid of contracted the deadly disease.<br /><br />The tale that unfolds as Lena counts down the days is absolutely captivating. Some may argue that the plot moves too slowly, until Alex comes into the picture, but I felt the world-building was necessary to make the tale believable. I loved watching the growth of Lena. She starts out as a sheep and ends up fighting against the system. It was delightful to watch. The romance between Lena and Alex progressed slowly and was believable. The second half of the book moves at a delicious pace as Lena begins to question everything she has been taught and uncovers lies, takes chances and falls in love. The ending ripped me apart as it ends in an unbelievable heart-stopping cliffhanger.<br /><br />I highly recommend Delirium to fans of dystopias and romance. Oliver's writing style is beautiful. The basic concept of love being a disease is so mind-boggling. While those suffering from a broken heart may find credibility in it; one also has to grasp the implications of a world without love. For example the love a mother feels for a child. How can you know true happiness if you've never experienced sadness? I am truly looking forward to book two.question everything she has been taught and uncovers lies, takes chances and falls in love.

B0011BBA2E|1.0|This is dreadful.  From Teal'c's son beating the crap out of him to Corin Nemec's disturbingly ingenuous acting style to the extraneous, nauseatingly dull, time-burning maiden 302 launch to all the mish mash, cobbled together, random crap in this episode, I was just glad when it was done.  Not recommended.
B006UG90RM|5.0|In the song \\"Blood and Fire\\" Dave states: \\"I told you I was coming back.  Say you missed me.  Say it like you mean it...\\"  Yes, Dave.  We DID miss you!  WELCOME BACK!!!<br /><br />I'll tell you now right now, I suck at reviewing things because I'm not good at going into detailed descriptions like others do.  All I can do is tell you my opinion on whether the album is worth buying or not.  The answer: YES!<br /><br />Now I must admit, I wanted to rate this album around 4 to 4.5, but figured I'd upgrade it to 5, because it exceeded my expectations.  I must admit, I was quite nervous about this album.  I just didn't expect too much from it.  Not only had it been 14 years since VH did an actual album, but it's been 28 years since they've recorded one with David Lee Roth on vocals.  I know the band has had their share of problems, and was afraid this might be one of those \\"we just cranked out an album for desperation's sake\\".  Luckily, I was very pleasantly surprised!  So for that reason, I found it worthy to give it a little \\"bonus boost\\" as far as my rating.<br /><br />You can tell from the lyrics that they're primarily done by Roth.  VERY DLR sounding, in that they're semi-silly, yet are sort of \\"smart\\" in a sense too.  This album picks up around where \\"Women and Children First\\" and \\"Fair Warning\\" left off.  In this album, we find the band (wisely) returning to their old-school hard rockin' sound.  No keyboards this time around, just vocals, guitar, bass and drums.  (And for the first album ever, we sadly have to say goodbye to original bassist, Michael Anthony.  Taking over the helm is Eddie's son Wolfgang, who does a fine job.  How cool would it be to be 20 years old and be in a hard rock band with your father and uncle?  Then there's crazy Uncle Dave, but that's another story...)<br /><br />Anyhow, favorite and least favorite tracks (no particular order)-<br /><br />Favorites:<br />Blood and Fire - This one is most reminiscent of \\"Women and Children First\\" stuff.  One of those \\"Guys Night Out\\" songs.  (Though they ALL kinda are...) For reasons I can't quite explain, this is the song that gets stuck in my head the most.<br /><br />You and Your Blues - NOT a blues song like you'd think.  Another typical Dave-era type VH song that sounds like it belongs on any of the pre-Diver Down albums.<br /><br />She's the Woman - This one is a re-working of an older, unused tune from VH's early days.  About half of the songs on this album are that way, which helps with the \\"old-school sound\\".  They're songs and/or music that were written for the early albums, but never used for various reasons.  The band went through and re-wrote some of the lyrics/music, etc. and tweaked up the old demos to album worthy songs.<br />---------<br />Least Favorites:<br /><br />China Town - Can't really explain why, but just nothing here that interested me.  Lyrics weren't too memorable, and the music wasn't really much to talk about either.<br /><br />Honeybabysweetiedoll - Music isn't all that bad on this one, but the lyrics are kinda \\"ehh\\".  Again, not really a song that's going to stick in your mind.<br /><br />Bullethead - This song is a bit annoying the first few times, but it does somewhat grow on you.  It'll never be on my \\"top half of the album\\" list though.  Lyrics aren't horrible, but the music is the one that kinda ruined this song.  There's just really nothing worth bragging about with this one.  Going along with the train theme of the album photos, this song is \\"The little engine that just quite couldn't\\".  It had potential, but just quite didn't make it over that hill...<br /><br />So that's it.  There isn't a BAD track on this album (nothing that'd in intentionally hit the \\"skip\\" button on), but there are, as expected, ones that are better than others.  I hope that VH has new-found success with this album/lineup.  It's about freakin' time that VH put out something worthwhile!  (Sadly, I didn't care for anything they've done since \\"F.U.*.K\\".  Irecall reading somewhere that Sammy Hagar claimed he heard this album and found nothing impressive about it.  He must have listened to the wrong album.  I'm a Sammy Hagar fan as well, (both VH stuff and his solo work) and I must admit I've liked this album a lot better than Sammy's last 3 solo studio albums.  His last album I can say I was really pleased with was \\"Ten 13\\".<br /><br />Anyhow, sorry my review is lame.  Like I said, I'm no pro reviewer, about all I can do is tell you whether I, as a fan, liked it or not.  And, yes, I DID.<br /><br />So, once again, Dave: YES!  WE MISSED YOU!  WELCOME BACK, VAN HALEN!!!listened to the wrong album.

145162445X|4.0|This is a well-written, entertaining book that is up to the minute with respect to cosmology. It has great value for that even if you have no interest in the organizing principle. One of the best parts of the book discusses how hypothetical scientists a trillion years from now would approach the issue of the origin of the universe. By that time it's possible that all evidence of a big bang will have disappeared, and the universe would look much like the scientific picture from 1900. That triggers the thought that there may be evidence for simple stories for the origin and evolution of the universe that we cannnot observe at the present time or in our current place, or perhaps that we could observe but do not think to investigate. The book does not mention that last point, perhaps because the reader is expected to supply it on her own.<br /><br />Without science, explaining why there is something rather than nothing requires explaining every leaf, rock, beetle and star. Cosmology and evolutionary theory pare the explanation requirement down to the point where it seems possible we might have to explain only a physical law or three, and everything else we observe can follow naturally. This book gives a clear roadmap of that process, both the parts that have already been done, the parts people are working on at the moment and some speculation (labeled as such) about how the remaining gaps might get filled in some day. Thus it might be that we don't have to explain why there is matter and energy, perhaps not even why there is three-dimensional space and time or why physical constants have the values they have.<br /><br />It is also possible, although harder to conceive, that we could explain everything down to nothing: no physical laws, only logic. Putting that another way, it might be that naive mental pictures of nothing are logically impossible. For example, if there is no space or time, where and when is there no space or time? The author describes this possibility as perhaps \\"nothing is unstable,\\" meaning (I think) that it's possible that any logically consistent nothing would evolve into something. Certainly the kinds of nothing we can easily imagine, such as a region of four-dimensional space-time with no matter and zero energy, might plausibly give birth to a big bang.<br /><br />It is this last part of the argument than gets fuzzy. By itself that wouldn't cost the book a star, but the author goes out of his way to cloud the issues and pick fights.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, this is not a matter of splitting hairs or having semantic debates. A universe we could explain from pure logic is a different kind of place from one that relies on a few equations whose origins we cannot explain, and that in turn is different from a universe with many apparently arbitrary parameters. The important point is each of these possibilities suggests different avenues for investigation. It's not a question of arguing with other people about the meaning of reality, it's a question of how to direct your intellectual efforts. And the measure of a theory is not an absolute standard of truth, but whether it produces useful new knowledge.<br /><br />In a purely logical universe, we should be able to learn things with mathematical insight alone, as often seems to be the case in science (see the wonderful [[ASIN:B004E3XD30 Is God a Mathematician?]] for a discussion of this). In a universe that rests on a few equations, it seems reasonable to speculate on why the equations are what they are. Perhaps they are logically necessary and reflect a deeper level of reality than naive observation can detect. Perhaps they give some clue to a larger reality in which our universe was created. If there are lots of apparently arbitrary parameters, the natural thing is to look for a simpler set of rules that could generate a multiverse, and rely on the anthropic principle or some other device to explain why we observe the values we do. That in turn would help us guess answers to questions.<br /><br />This book seems to reject that view, insisting repeatedly that the universe is what it is and implying there is no value to looking for meaning. That might be right, of course. We might find that we can explain the universe from pure logic, but that furthur logical deductions from the same premises turn out to be false. We might explain the universe down to a few equations and find no other insight possible, just the arbitrary equations. We might find a bunch of  parameters that seem tailored to allow human life, but then find that consequences of the anthropic assumption are not correct. Tomorrow someone might discover a circle whose circumference was not pi times its diameter, or a person who can bend spoons from pure mental effort, or random exceptions to well-established generalizations. However, why would anyone assert these things so positively? The evidence of the history of science weighs on the other side, and anyone who believes these things should find science a pointless pursuit.<br /><br />It seems that the experience of debating people who read too much meaning into things, and who assume the universe corresponds to their preferences rather than using guesses about meaning to suggest lines of inquiry, has driven the author to an absurd extreme in the opposite direction.p us guess answers to questions.<br /><br />This book seems to reject that view, insisting repeatedly that the universe is what it is and implying there is no value to looking for meaning.

B005ISQ7JM|2.0|This book is an attempt to describe the new features offered by HTML5, however the author seems to be stuck on the words 'video' and 'audio'. There is also a great attempt, with little success, to bring some humor around, similar to the 'For Dummies' series.<br />The book in itself offers little to what HTML5 has to offer, and I would not recommend you read it unless you have nothing else to do.

B004EBT5CU|2.0|It is hard for me to believe that so many people rate this performer far too high.  Adele's style is a poor merging of Country, R&B, Pop and Noise.  Unfortunately she only fully succeeds in Noise.  She has a LOUD voice that on occasion drops the note and goes off key.  But, with the airways filled with Rap/Crap, Slop/Pop, Bubble Gum Rock, Rhythm with no Blues, and just Punk/junk, the listening \\"world\\" is so starved for really good entertainers that they are willing to accept what ever they can get.  For those of us who remember the truly great performers, Adele is really average.  There is a redundancy in her songs.  Many of them sound the same.  Her vocal range is like that of a child.  And although it can go from hushed to horrible, she does not always carry the music through the changes.  Perhaps the reason she needed surgery on her vocal cords is because she is trying very hard to sing in octaves that she physically can not handle.  I do not write this to cast dispersions on those who enjoy Adele's music; I say \\"good for you\\".  I write this for those of us who have a much greater appreciation of truly great singers and those who know that noise does not equal music.  Adele's singing is maybe \\"not really bad\\", but truthfully, Adele's singing is definitely NOT THAT GOOD.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I loved this book. I actually parent more the French way than the American way. (yes, I know that different Americans parent differently but there is certainly, at least in the middle class, a very child centric cater to your child and turn them into a narcissist culture)  I thought it all sounded fantastic until I read the part about both parents working but the mother does all of the housework! REALLY? Why would both work and then one feel entitled to relax while watching their partner doing housework...as though women are less than?  But as far as the parenting, loved it.

B006OAB3ME|1.0|This CD is a new low for McCartney.  Is he trying to be a caricature of a lounge singer?  His voice is so contrived and hoaky, it is almost unbearable to listen to this CD.  When he appeared on Saturday Night Live, he sang off-key and his voice lacked range and dynamics.  I'm not sure that what he has done on this CD is not a cover-up for him losing his voice.  I have been a life-long McCartney fan, have even liked all of his solo albums, but this effort is just plain horrible.  I doubt if I'll play it a second time.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|There comes a time in a man's life when you have just about seen and done it all.  Paul is no exception.  Far from being \\"finished\\" the man keeps going  on the idea that he has much more to share in spite of the stellar career he has created.  It is fitting that a man of his weight and years should produce  such an album--an appreciation of the music that impressed him as a youth, while putting his own \\"spin\\" on each effort.  This is the kind of work that most  everyone will enjoy.  If you have been among the faithful for the last four decades, you can sit back with your favorite drink and really enjoy an intimate  work by your favorite artist.  The other side of the coin is \\"Run Devil Run\\" where the old jukebox tunes are on offer and done equally well.  But, \\"Kisses\\"  is a sweet and melancholy collection from a sweet and melancholy man.  It is time to turn down the lights--tonight will not rock.  Tonight will not even  swing.  But, tonight will really touch you where you live.  People will do him an injustice in rejecting this work as just another American Songbook. They should broaden their vista and be willing to accept something out of the ordinary from someone who is extraordinary.  I loved it.  I think you will, too.

B006UG90RM|3.0|Ok, so here we are - finally a VH cd of \\"new\\" music... I bought it because of Eddie, not Roth, not Alex and certainly not Wolfie - no disrespect to the young man.  It's a LOUD and an obnoxious ROCk record. Eddie's playing is REALLY hot, on fire. Alex's drumming exceeded my personal expectations - a plus. The bass is too low in the mix, IF it really is Wolf playing, then good for him - he's good.  Roth can't sing for S*% T - he's voice is gone and it ain't never coming back.  There is a reason why they did not include these demos on any of the previous albums - they are not as strong as the stuff that was already released.  It's a good rock record. Better than I thought it would be. It's classic V H but I guess they could not sit Roth and Eddie in the same room to write new material, so we get this instead - old material re-done.  No point in drawing ANY parallels between Sammy's band and Ed's band - totally different caliber players.  If you're 14 and you ain't never heard a great guitar player , then grab this album - it would seem like a whole new world - but in truth - it's good old rock and roll that's produced by ageing men who try too hard to sound like it's 1976 all over again.  I'm not seeing them on tour cause Roth can't sing live to save his own.  Peace.
0060873027|2.0|This book was NOT written by Michael Crichton; as mentioned by other reviewers, his work apparently concluded with the formulation of the overall storyline and construction of scenes, characters, etc. Richard Preston is a terrible writer with a very amateurish style, so the only thing that made me stick through to the end was the signature Crichton plot. (Like most of his other novels, it involves pseudo-plausible cutting edge technology being the impetus for an unlikely yet thrilling adventure, and teach you some new scientific jargon along the way.)  As a result, MICRO comes across as a shameless attempt to cash in on Crichton's reputation, with just enough substance to loosely qualify it to have his name on the cover. At least the last posthumous release, [[ASIN:B0057DCQMK Pirate Latitudes: A Novel]], was largely based on material that Crichton had actually written himself. The difference between the two books is night and day. I can only recommend MICRO to those die-hard fans that absolutely must own everything that has Crichton's name on it, but even then you need to realize what you're getting. Everyone else should steer clear.
0062101897|5.0|This was a gift for my son and while I only flipped through it briefly when it arrived, it was obviously a very high caliber and impressive work.<br /><br />My son is still, these months later, relating fun facts or interesting tidbits from the book, so it was definitely a huge success.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game, it is one of my favorites. There are so many different mini games that keep me entertained. Highly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this app is good to burn time when you are bored. I enjoy the auto-complete feature since it saves me the time of doing it myself.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|awesome movie especially with a 3d up-conversion.  blu ray displays brilliantly.  like a modern day pocahontas in my humble opinion.  really keeps the viewer captivated
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I am extremely happy with this cover.  It  toois even better than described and feels like a well loved leather book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's not so much a game of chance as it is skill, which somehow creates the illusion that I'm not just wasting time oj a pointless game... even though really it probably does fall under that category.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|THE SERIES IS SLOW PACED, I WAS HOPING FOR MORE VIOLENCE AND ACTION. IT DOES KEEP YOUR INTEREST WANTING MORE.  STEVE BUSCEMI AT HIS FINEST.
B0071QIN00|1.0|Step 1: remove everything that made the first game good Step 2: add fire and chicks Step 3: have the app crash often Step 4: ??? Step 5: profit?  seriously, not having feint on every level is inexcusable
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Yeah yo, Adele has got it going on. Smokin' stacked body and the voice. Having seen her on the Grammys last night I am as equally impressed with her multi fasceted vocal range as I am with her wild cockney british accent, reminiscent of the old lady characters that you see on Monty Pythons Flying Circus... wow! I'm diggin, plus she's a brick house!<br /><br />I actually aquired this album a while back, about two weeks before it was even released actually, and instantly realized that it would become a Grammy winning album of the year (as it did, seven Grammmays) It may not be everyones cup of tea, but it has all the elements that make a timeless record. Great songwriritng (notice that in the Grammy song of the year category all other nominees were songs witten by at least seven people each. It should not take seven writers to write one song! Adele did the whole album with herself and one other writer...)<br /><br />Anyway, Adele can smack me around all day. Maybe get rough on that Katy Perry chick too! I bet Adele could kick the crap out me either way, and I am extremely turned on by this. The album is great, you know that already.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Nothing much can be added to the hundreds of reviews this DVD has already received but here are a few quick comments.<br /><br />1. The movie is by and large quite faithful to the book. This is both good and bad. The good obviously means that a great book is brought to the screen. The bad means that the pacing has to be very fast in order to preserve the structure of the book. This means that anyone not familiar with the book might have quite the task keeping pace as plot developments come at the viewer thick and fast.<br /><br />2. Our three stalwarts, portrayed by Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, are on their own for much of the film with no supporting cast to help carry the load. They all do a fine job. The Potter series was truly fortunate when these three were cast.<br /><br />3. The film really can't stand on its own nor is it supposed to. It does try to come to a climax of sort and succeeds more or less but no viewer can possibly be satisfied with it. I recommend waiting to watch this until Part 2 is in hand to avoid frustration.<br /><br />Highly recommended. The Potter series has maintained high standards throughout. This film validates the decision to split the final book into two parts.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|The games are terrible.  I can't even finish some of them because the controls are off the bottom of the screen.  I would play this if I was stuck on a desert island.
B005I4JG80|3.0|Breezing through this book, it is a quick and fun read about parenting in France.  One of the biggest problems with this book is the author relies heavily on French parenting forums/chat rooms and French magazines, and less on actual interaction with French people.  The author comments that it is difficult to make friends in France as a foreigner, but her observations would be more credible if she had spent more time with actual French families. I give this book 3 stars instead of 4 because I don't believe that the author actually made the gateau au yaourt recipe in the book, as the proportions do not make a cake, but a salty bread.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The game is okay.  There are a couple of the games that the control  is hard to maneuver. It's like there is a lag that makes it too slow to perform the action. Overall it's just okay.
0545265355|5.0|I had never heard of this series, but saw a few people mention it on Facebook.  Decided to buy them and finished all 3 books in 4 days.  Awesome!!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Nothing much can be added to the hundreds of reviews this DVD has already received but here are a few quick comments.<br /><br />1. Don't be put off by the many one star reviews. Most are complaints (quite legitimate, I'm sure) about the Ultraviolet digital copy. I purchased for the DVD and could not care less about Ultraviolet.<br /><br />2. The movie is by and large quite faithful to the book. This is both good and bad. The good obviously means that a great book is brought to the screen. The bad means that the pacing has to be very fast in order to preserve the structure of the book. This means that anyone not familiar with the book might have quite the task keeping pace as plot developments come at the viewer thick and fast.<br /><br />3. Unlike other films in this series this views much like an action movie with long battle sequences. Curiously, the film adopts some action movie motifs like magic wands that seem to emulate machine guns and artillery in their effects. This is also the case in Part 1 also. By and large, though strange, this worked for me. The escape from Gringott's and the battle of Hogwarts are fantastic sequences.<br /><br />4. Even if you've read the book don't watch this without watching Part 1. Get both parts and watch them in quick succession over a weekend at most.<br /><br />Highly recommended. The Potter series has maintained high standards throughout. This film validates the decision to split the final book into two parts.
0061726834|5.0|Delirium is a dystopian novel based on an interesting premise: what is life like in a society where love is illegal? In Lena's world, everyone receives an operation at age eighteen which prevents them from feeling love. They are paired with a spouse by the government and spend the rest of their lives in a sedated tranquility. Only a few months away from her surgery, Lena meets a mysterious stranger named Alex and begins to question everything around her.  Delirium was suspenseful and had me glued to my kindle, eager to learn what would happen next. Lauren Oliver's writing draws the reader in; she has the gift of being able to phrase everything beautifully. My favorite aspect of the book, though, were the small details that showed what a world would be like without love. Romeo and Juliet become a cautionary tale, indifferent parents are not attached to their children, and no one has heard of poetry. I loved that Oliver slid these details into the story and let them sit, tugging at my mind.  This is the first novel in a trilogy, with its sequel Pandemonium releasing in a few weeks. Sometimes it pays off to read a book so late; I hardly have to wait at all to learn what happens to the characters to whom I've grown attached.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|This is a great product! It is light-weight and not bulky but is nicely padded. I got the lime green, great color!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love the thought you have to put into the game. Trying to figure the puzzle in the perfect amount of moves makes it more interesting. I love it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy the game. the only issue I have with it is that it can take a while to unlock the next game.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Over Christmas I didn't get a chance to see this movie on TV, so I purchased it myself. It arrived in great condition, plays good, and no complaints.
1596432594|4.0|Feynman should be required reading in all physics classes. I realize I don't have much credibility in making this pronouncement, as the person who just had to ask, \\"Is physics math or science?\\" Anyway, I didn't know anything about Richard Feynman before reading this graphic novel and I was missing out.  Feynman was an incredible character: Nobel prize winner, physicist, safe cracker, drummer, and fortunately, a raconteur.  Jim Ottaviani did extensive research in order to write this book, as so much of the text comes from Feynman's own work and speeches. These efforts give the reader a well-rounded picture of Feynman the man, flaws and all. In addition to his genius, the authors show his womanizing and his internal debate over the consequences of his creations. Overall, he seems like a person with whom you would like to share a meal.  I appreciate that Ottaviani did not shy away from the mathematics involved in Feynman's work. Sometimes I followed along, occasionally I just enjoyed the illustrations. A challenge that Feynman took on in his later years was to simply explain his work to a friend, which evolved into The Feynman Lectures on Physics. For what it's worth, this is the most I've ever attempted to understand anything like this. Don't judge me.  As an illustrator, Leland Myrick faced the challenge that all of his characters are real people of whom photographs exist. His drawings are realistic, while still beautifully capturing the abstract depictions of Feynman's mind.  I wish this was the first in a series of graphic novels about historical figures because Ottaviani and Myrick are an incredible team. Older teens will enjoy Feynman and feel like I do, eager for more.
B005UG542S|5.0|Loved this movie! Streamed great on the roku! I am a huge Harry Potter fan and the movies keep getting better and better. If you are thinking about this movie... Think no more, rent it, and enjoy!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It's hard to find fault with this bag.  I looked at dozens of bags costing at least 2-3 times as much.  I found all of them lacking in one way or another.  Many were just too big and bulky and others were just too small to hold my camera battery pack, 3 lenses, charger, flash, cords etc.  The other medium bags of this type were not deep enough to hold the SLR with battery pack and lens attached.  This bag is the perfect dimensions to hold my gear without having to remove the battery pack or lens, and it is a steal at under $40.00.  I don't think you can go wrong with this bag.  Plenty of room, well designed and easy to customize compartments.  I love it.
0061251321|5.0|Before entering the final phase of my MBA program I recently began a marathon of business related book reading in order to brush up on my knowledge. I began with classics like \\"Good to Great\\" by Jim Collins, \\"Leading Change\\" by John Kotter and though these are great books I had pretty much covered all the material in the MBA program. Reading these books was more of a review than injecting any new materials.  The reason for my marathon read (of about ten books) was that during my education I felt that there was an essential component that was missing. I was on a mission searching for this missing link. Through one of my network connections I had been given the suggestion to read Tribal Leadership.  Despite my suspicion of \\"new age\\" style literature I am very glad that I listened to them. I can, without a doubt, claim that that this book was one of the most important books that I have ever read. Not only did the authors supply me with the academic support for many of my own beliefs, they provided me with a new way to view the world, through the language that people use. This book portrayed a very accurate and realistic view that, I believe, can change the world. I know that Tribal Leadership is a huge link in closing the missing elements in my education and personal development.  I easily give this book five stars both for content and style. It was a pleasure to read and it will sit on a prominent place on my shelf of limited but valuable reference books. I would certainly recommend that any leader or manager in any organization pick up this book and give it a read.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|At first blush this game seems a bit simple ... but there is a bit of thought involved and strategy if you wish to clear the board completely.  I prefer this version to the first version, although the clock is a non-factor in this version, which is kind of disappointing.  The latest update (I installed the update 2/12/12) seems to have made the game s bit faster, less buggy, and more challenging.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my favorite game on the kindle! :).I play it all the time! You can just sit there and play it forever! Solitaire is amazing i love it!
B006SV2LWA|2.0|This movie streams in great on the roku. I really like ordering movies from amazon. The movie itself was kind of disappointing. Its OK, just thought it would have been a little better. Hope this helps.
B004JY0KP8|5.0|I love this watch. It looks great with either dress or casual clothes, and with an additional Hadley Roma black strap, I can wear it with almost anything I wear on any occasion.<br /><br />It's a perfect size in my opinion. Not too big, but not undersized like some \\"dress\\" chronos are. I have received several compliments about this watch in the month I have owned it. It's now a tough decision between this one and my beautiful Citizen EcoDrive chrono with black face.<br /><br />Keeps precise time and I do use the chrono function when I'm playing poker and cooking!<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.
B0071QIN00|1.0|this app is freaking stupid!! it wouldn't respond to my commands, I press forward and the freaking dude slows down... Wtf!!
B006UG90RM|5.0|heard the news new van halen on the coming horizon needles to say i felt just like a kid again and counted the days until the record hit the store & internet shelf's.  Well after a couple of spins on the cd player i must say this little treasure with david lee roth is a sure fire masterpiece. it has everything sprinkled into a new album for the true fans of van halen just plain good old fashioned rock passion.  Eddie plays his soul off and alex drumming never sounded better and david lee roth is in perfect harmony again and last but not least wolfie is a true shining star.  looking forward to the next album and they still have the magic:)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! The writing is so captivating and every sentence left me clinging for more. The story itself is so different than a lot of books I've read and the suspense kept me going. The characters are great, they feel complete and you get just the right amount of information at just the right times. I would highly recommend this book, and I cannot wait for the second book!
B005TBN3EU|1.0|Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.  Instructions require these reviews to contain at least 20 words.  So besides it being a really terrible movie, i would only add that I like these types of movies in general. But this one was....terrible.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|The Yemen is a river in the country of Yemen, which occupies the south-western corner of the Arabian Peninsula. As we know, that entire middle-eastern area is hot, dry, and arid. In this Lasse Halstrom-directed dramedy, an oil-billionaire sheik from Yemen owns several estates in Scotland and has developed a fondness for fly fishing. He dreams of a way to bring the sport to his homeland and at the same time encourage his fellow countrymen to upgrade their way of life with an improved water supply.<br /><br />We loved this cast (mostly) from the UK:<br />  * Emily Blunt (\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\") is the first person contacted by the sheik. Her job is to research the practicality of the idea and make a recommendation. To complicate matters, her fiancé is soon reported missing in (military) action in Afghanistan.<br />  * Ewan McGregor (\\"Beginners\\") is a mid-level bureaucrat with a touch of Asperger's who loves fly fishing on weekends. When approached about the feasibility of this experiment, he makes outlandish demands, assuming that their cost will deter these foolish people. He is struck dumb when his demands are met, e.g., the engineers who designed the Three Gorges Dam in China.<br />  * Kristen Scott Thomas (\\"Nowhere Boy\\") is a blunt, plain-spoken government official who can see the public relations advantages for news from the Mid-east that doesn't include the escalating price of petroleum or body bags. She is hilarious in this (initially) preposterous plot and provides many laugh-out-loud moments. You will LOVE her e-mails!<br />  * Amr Waked (\\"The Father and the Foreigner\\") is the fabulously wealthy sheik with the dream. It's obvious that he is intelligent and has already studied the situation. When our troubled heroine denies she is anxious, he says, \\"I have too many wives not to know when a woman is upset!\\" We can see why this actor is a heartthrob in his native Egypt.<br />  * Tom Mison (\\"One Day\\") is our heroine's fiancé, loving, considerate AND handsome!<br /><br />I haven't read Paul Torday's novel on which this film is based, but knowing salmon are anadromous, I suspect the migration to salt water would be too hot and arduous, so I personally had reservations about feasibility. On the other hand, this film had far more comedy than we expected and was far more touching as well, so eventually it didn't matter. I even got goosebumps when that fish turned around and started upstream. Nice surprise!<br /><br />I've signed up to be notified when this becomes available on DVD from Amazon.com
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|its. dumb because. every time i try to download it want let me install it so just put in a dollar and get the ad free version
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer.  I absolutely loved this book. Originally I thought these books were for teens. I am 64 and this book was recommended by a 55 year old friend. She said this book was impossible to put down and she was so right. I love the central character Katniss a young independent smart and capable lady. The post apocalyptic world in this book is fascinating and scary. Anyhow loved it!!!!!!!!!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This app is endless hours of fun. Its a great app to play around with when bored, and even little kids seemed pretty amazed with it.
B002BWP49C|3.0|I saw BD in theatres, so I knew I wasn't getting an exceptional movie. Nonetheless, I love the book series and have purchased all the movies so I got this one as well. The movie was allright, it wasn't nearly as impressive as it was made out to be. The CGI wolves talking was hysterical... I laughed out loud in the theatre because it sounds so ridiculous. They shouldn't have made the voices echo, it just sounded silly. And the Denali clan's eyes looked over the top- it made their eyes bugg out instead of look beautiful. Also, why not put in more information about the immortal children?!? That was a huge plot point in the books, and it was well worth exploring theatrically. Edward's joke of a search on the internet was pointless without the backdrop of the immortal children's history. The biggest surprise so far for me was learning what a whimpy \\"special edition\\" this was! No sneak peek at BD part 2, very limited special features- the personal wedding video was just pointless. The documentary was interesting, but still nothing that couldn't be found online through a google search of breaking dawn. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed. I'm hoping part 2 is better!
B005LAIGPA|5.0|this is an awesome movie. i usually don't like movies in the documentary style but this one was awesome. i don't know why it just was. the actors in this movie were great. and i loved the special features and the story. all in all this movie was awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B003HLM2QO|3.0|You know we all know that Ozzy has very little to do with these projects anymore but the team he and Sharon & Jack have put together is simply amazing. The team went out and foung Gus G and introduced us to yet another incredible guitarist . Check out Firewind you will be hooked. For the last 35 years Ozyy and Black Sabbath has toured with not just opening acts but the best upcoming metal bands in history. From Kiss, Metalica, Iron Madien, Van Halen Def Leperd, Motley Crue all were Ozzys opening acts and yes he got his abutt kicked more than once. So what it kept the energy and desire in his soul working with the best. I think he should go back to the Ozzfest concept now and maybe come out and play a song or two with one of the groups I do not want to see the Oz fall over on stage .  Sharon would have him stuffed and wheel him out on stage if she thought she could make a buck off of it ! R.I.P Ozzy you have earned a rest my friend. Thank you for all that your are and have been to all of us. WE LOVE YOU ALL !!!!!!!!!

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I bought this watch about a month ago.  I love it.  Once you learn how to use this (which is not hard)  it will surpass your expectation.  It is my first GPS watch, my only negative comment is  it is pretty big on the wrist  for a women  but the velcro strap helps wtih that issue.  Thanks Garmin
B004EBT5CU|1.0|I'm not trying to hate on the artist or anything, but I don't not get her popularity at all. She's labeled as \\"pop\\" a lot of the time, but she's anything but. Maybe that's why I'm not that in to her music, because pop is my favorite genre. But, even if this is not my type of music, I don't see how this album has produced three #1 singles. The three #1 singles: \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\" \\"Someone Like You,\\" and \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" are all dull and boring and sound very similar. I can see how she's sold so many albums, because her music is what a lot of people consider \\"credible\\" and this type of music sells albums, but I don't get the singles success. I remember in early 2008 when her song \\"Chasing Pavements\\" was released and how utterly boring it was, and this album is in the same exact vein as her first. Her songs all sound the same, but maybe that's what a lot of people like. Don't get me wrong, she seems like a lovely person, it's just that her music and sound is very monotonous and one-dimensional.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game was okish. some games are kinda cheesy. however. its fun. so yea. I mean its free. so why not get it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Although I will never beat my wife's time...I am totally hooked. This game is great but also addicting. play at your own risk!
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|this is an awesome movie. the smurfs rule. this movie is really good. i thought that they did well on developing the characters. i espcialy liked the guy who played gargamel. i mean he was gargamel. if they do another smurfs movie they need to keep him. this movie is awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B006ISJQ1W|2.0|\\"Do not confuse love with lust, nor drunkenness with judgment.\\" Journalist Paul Kemp (Depp) has moved to Puerto Rico in order to start over. Getting a job with the local paper he meets a varied cast of characters.  During his conversations he begins to discover things about everyone. He now is left to decide weather to use his writing for good for him or others. I have to start by admiting that I am not a Johnny Depp fan. To me he plays the same type of character in almost every movie. There have been a few of his movies that I do really like though. \\"Fear & Loathing\\" is one I happen to like so I was looking forward to this one. If you go in (like I did) expecting the same type of movie you will be dissapointed. This is more comparable to \\"The Tourist\\" in the way that ten minutes in you lose total interest in the movie and only keep watching because the girl is hot. Depp fans may love this but I did not. Overall, a movie that most Depp fans will like. I give it a C+.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|the pigs are mean but the birds get pay back and golden eggs are hard to find but I love it

I haven't heard A-ha in a long time and I enjoyed this vid over and over again. Now I am waiting for the 25 years album to get here. Enjoy[[ASIN:B004LZRSBY Ending on a High Note: Final Concert [Blu-ray]]]
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|this movie is awesome. this is a great movie. i love the story i love the action i love the characters the music and special effects. the robots are so cool. my favorite is noisy boy. he was the coolest looking robot. i love this movie. i hope they do a sequel. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have avoided reading this book since I heard about it after it's initial release. It's not that it didn't sound intriguing, children fighting to death in an artificially created arena (what's not to like?), but as an adult I oftentimes feel that anything within the \\"teen romance\\" genre simply shouldn't be for me. I mean, I haven't been a teenager in over a decade.  Finally, after the recommendation of many brilliant, age 30ish friends, I took the plunge and could not be more pleased. The author has created a fantastic world that you will absolutely fall in love with (and sometimes hate), one that even adults will appreciate. The only drawback of reading this series is finishing it and finding that you wish there was a fourth book...
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have this same app on my phone.  Fun to play, easy to understand.  Works well on the Kindle Fire.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I was initially excited when I made the purchase. Then I received a lightweight box from Amazon a few days later. The bottom shell isn't bad, but the top lid is flimsy at best. Worst of all is the slight hint of a groove in the back for the flimsy lid to rest when trying to use this in a tabletop application. Press too hard on one side and it falls over. Major design flaw. NOT WORTH THE $29.95!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|this movie is awesome. this is a great movie with a great message and that message is to be a good father and to trust in god. this is one of the best dramas i've seen in a long time. this movie will make you cry, laugh and be thankfull for god and all that you got. i think fathers all over the world should see this movie and be a good dad to thier sons and daughters. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I had written a review  on the Walking Dead a few days ago that made no sense whatsoever, and I gave the show only one  star out of five. I put the show down because of one statement that was made on only one episode that I really hated even though I believe the show as a whole is great stuff. Somebody responded to this review and showed me that I was way off on my review and they were right. I forget the person's name who wrote to me and opened my eyes that what I wrote was wrong, and he was so right and very constructive with his criticism.So I deleted my old review and I now admit that I was way off in the disrespectful things I had said. So, when season 2 comes out on bluray I will be one of the first to buy it, and since I collect comic books--I just may add the Walking Dead comic to my collection.

B004EPZ02A|4.0|My expectations were low. I mean how far can you stretch a franchise before it implodes. Actually, pretty far, and still ahve you craving more. This has to be my favourite in the series. There are no false scares, the hallmarks are all still there and put to good use.  The only gripe I have is that the girls who have gone through this traumatic experience, in particular, the end scene...so how did life go on as normal for them? In parts one and two, they refer to their experiences merely in passing yet what we see here is utter terror. The grandma? What became of her and what did she do with the girls? Live happily ever after with our ghost at her house? Or did I miss something?  Still a good movie. Part four on it's way apparently.

B006ZDS7CE|5.0|the critics against , in this case rather remind  me of the nay sayers regarding lene lovich when she first appeared on the music scene in 1978<br />they didn't like her at all.her music was different and that kind of different wasn't accepted by the majority./but sooner than later she was doing well enough to attract fans for the next 25 plus years.lana del rey could be in that same respect,  another lene lovich, given that she continues in her musical career and doesn't give up.lana del rey might never be the sensation that the top recording artists of today are,but she can easily remain afloat and maintain a following if she continues to do music.

B006J420UE|5.0|Not as avid a gamer as I once was. So I can live without having the best vid card and fastest processor out. This is a great value and delivers enough performance to play just about any game with medium to high graphics settings (assuming you are playing 1920x1080). Runs very cool as well. The CPU to buy if you don't feel like breaking the bank on the top of the line CPU/Video Card combo.
0307352145|5.0|Quiet is a new book by Susan Cain which delves deeply into the world of introverts. After reading many very positive review of the book I, being an introvert myself, had high expectations for this book. Without a doubt Quiet met my high expectations and much more. This is a must have book for anyone who is an introvert or needs to interact with introverts including; spouses, children or co-workers.  This wonderful book provided many insights into my own behaviors but also provided me with a practicable guide to working with project teams. Additionally, my wife, a special education teacher, finds the material very appropriate for teachers with introverted students in their class - which in reality would be any teacher.  The book is divided into four parts:  Part 1: The Extrovert Ideal - Covers the rise and myths of extrovert leadership in our society  Part 2: Your Biology, Your Self? - Reviews the biological difference between introverts and extroverts and the resulting impacts  Part 3: Do all Cultures Have an Extrovert Idea? - Explores the differences in views of the extrovert ideal in American and Asia  Part 4: How to Love, How to Work - Provides life lessons for dealing with introverts  What follows are just some of the highlight from each section.  Part 1: The Extrovert Ideal  One of the most interesting aspects of this section is how extroverts came to be seen more prominently in the American society. Cain expertly traces the rise of extroverts in America and offers insights into why other countries view extroverts less prominently.  We are then allowed to follow the author as she visits the extrovert havens of a high energy Anthony Robbins seminar and Harvard Business School.  Not surprisingly we don't tend to find many introverts at either gathering. Along the way Cain lets us in on some research that does surprise us - group brainstorming session are less productive, in terms of idea quality and quantity, than individual brain storming.  These finding have significant implication for business and project managers.  Cain also shows the impacts of the new open office layouts which are becoming more popular in business settings. The impacts are not the anticipated positive ones to increase collaboration but are found to instead increase anxiety and employee turnover. Oops!  Part 2: Your Biology, Your Self?  Part 2 is where we jump into the biology of introverts and extroverts and resulting ramifications of not listening to introverts. This section begins with a clarification of the difference between temperament and personality. Cain reveals how research has shown that our introvert/extrovert temperaments as teenagers and adults can be predicted when we are only four months old.  Of more consequence we begin to understand the situations where introverts can be both better leaders and negotiators than their extroverted counterparts. Cain also explores the Winner's Concept which plagues many extroverts and had a hand in the financial recession of 2008. This section makes me want to make sure an introvert is managing my financial investments!  Most importantly for introverts we learn how to better deal with the made for extrovert situations we dread so much; such as when we need to make small talk with groups and give presentations. Quiet contains wonderful tools to help introverts survive these challenging situations.  Part 3: Do all Cultures Have an Extrovert Idea?  In this section Cain provides a brief but informative comparison between the American and Asian cultures. This section and chapter is a helpful guide for creating better relationships with Asian co-workers.  Part 4: How to Love, How to Work  Cain saves the best for last! In the final section, we learn how can better live, love and work as, and with, introverts and importantly for teachers and parents, how to best facilitate young introverts in their learning and development.  For me this section explained why I have a hard time following my wife's conversation at dinner and why I should never refer to my daughter, or anyone for that matter, as being `shy'. In addition we learn how to assist our introvert children with noisy settings such as play dates.  The insights into questions that parents should and should ask of their kids after school, such as never ask the general question `How was your day?', can also be applied to my work as a project manager when interacting with team members.  Conclusion  Simply put, Quiet is a very well researched and written book about the life of introverts. It is a must read for anyone who is or associated with introverts. I expect in some cases this book could be a life changer for many introverts.  Many kudos and thanks to Susan Cain for writing such a helpful and thought provoking book. Keep up the excellent work and championing for us introverts!
B000286S8S|1.0|The Best of Both Worlds, Van Halen's second greatest hits, is a total waste. There are only three new songs. THREE!!! And where in the world is Gary Cherone?!? At least give Gary the best tracks off of III. At least Without You, and Fire In The Hole. Maybe Year to the Day. But Eddie's ego has ruined this band. And on the new songs, I haven't heard a note of Mike's bass. I think the new songs are weak. the best one is Up For Breakfast. The rest is total crap. Don't waste your money. Just buy the albums that have your favorite songs on them.
030788743X|4.0|Wow. This was great. I am a child of the 80's, and this book made me think... maybe that's not so uncool. This book is heavy on the geek culture, but though I was an outsider amongst nerds (a computerless dweeb who was jealous of the gangs of Dungeons and Dragoners and their Friday meetings) I still got into it. Just when the nostalgia was starting to wane, HE DROPPED MAXX HEADROOM IN THERE! Lots of action and adventure - this thing had me riding all the way through it. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the most common complain in sci fi. Civilization is falling apart, no one can get a job, but everybody has a computer and is online all the time in this uber reality. It still takes credits (money) to go places and have \\"things\\" when you are in the OASIS, but yet part of society's problem is that everyone is spazzed outline all the time. There's a power crisis, but again, everyone's online using these super powerful computers and there's tons of solor power in use. I gave the story a pass, though, as those things sort of faded into the bakground. A really fun ride. And a trip through memory lane for a child of the 80's. OH - and this must be a movie. This would be an INCREDIBLE movie!!
B0049D1TCM|4.0|She is so contradicting! She sings about motivating young women to become somebody, then she uses profane words to describe herself, such as cu*t.

My favorite songs are Rockferry, Syrup & Honey, Distant Dreamer, Warwick Avenue, and Mercy.<br /><br />Jennifer K. Lafferty<br />Author of Offbeat Love Stories and More

B000MV90IU|5.0|I was reminded watching 2011's best movie \\"Drive\\" of the similarities Ryan Gosling's character has with Steve McQueen's in \\"Bullitt.\\"  Not so much the story or even their backgrounds but their character's behavior.  Frank Bullitt (McQueen) is a San Francisco police detective who is charged with guarding an important witness coming before a Senate subcommittee hearing.  The mob investigation is headed by a Sen. Walter Chalmers (a despicable Robert Vaughn) who bullies the police and others.<br />When the safe house location is compromised, the witness is mortally wounded and taken to the hospital where he eventually dies.  Bullit smells something fishy and moves the body without telling Chalmers what happened.  Thanks to a cooperative doctor who Chalmers had previously \\"dissed\\", the secret is maintained.<br /><br />In one of the best car chase scenes in movie history, Bullitt realizes he is being followed by mob hit men.  Bullitt in his green Ford Mustang and the bad guys in their Dodge Charger engage in some unbelievable stunts in the hills of San Francisco.  The scene holds up today.  Bullitt's ruse is eventually discovered but an additional wrinkle in the case precludes and even deeper plot.  In a defining role, McQueen's Bullitt is the essence of cool.  More on that later.  He is short on words, long on action.  He has a way with the ladies but is taken with only one (a 23 year old Jacqueline Bisset).  Like the car chase, the movie holds up today.<br /><br />I watched this on Blu ray which does have a slightly improved picture but unlike many other transfers, this one isn't night and day better.  The sound is a big letdown.  The Blu ray has the same old 2.0 stereo this time in Dolby Digital vs. Dolby Surround.  It matters little.  I was looking forward to hearing the engines roar on the Mustang and Charger in a new uncompressed way.<br /><br />The big highlight on the Blu ray single disc and DVD 2-disc special edition is the added features.  The first is a 2005 Turner Classic Movies documentary called \\"Steve McQueen:  The Essence of Cool\\" which gives viewers some history of his film career and his personal life.  The second documentary is a very educational and informative \\"The Cutting Edge: The Magic of Movie Editing.\\"  This doc is in high definition and Dolby Digital 5.1.  Released in 2005, it is a well done inside look about the importance of the editor in filmmaking.  Numerous editors are interviewed consistent with the movies they worked on.  Nearly every top director is also in the film giving their insights into the editor's role.  This doc is a must for anyone really interested in how motion pictures are made.  In addition snippets of some of the best movies ever made going back to the silent era are shown.rner Classic Movies documentary called \\"Steve McQueen:  The Essence of Cool\\" which gives viewers some history of his film career and his personal life.

B005HSG3VK|2.0|When I first received the microshell folio (white), I was thrilled about it. It was lightweight, had good coverage on the kindle, etc. However, just two months or so after receiving it, ive found that the quality just isn't up to my expectations, especially given the cost.  I loved the soft-rubberish texture of the cover, since it felt like it wasn't just any old hard plastic. The texture was great. But now, that gesturing is peeling off the cover, making the cover look really cheap, especially along the edges. All along the edges of my case, there are splotches where the texturing has just peeled off from typical use. I haven't abused this cover. It is usually in my purse or on my nightstand when not in use. While at one point I half-considered filing down a sharp edge at the bottom where it dug into my finger, I never actually did that.  I'm just feeling frustrated with this product. It doesn't look that great when its peeling... had I known this would happen, especially within just a few months, I would not have purchased this.product.
B005LAIGVY|3.0|Now that George Lucas has repackaged his 6 episode chronicle Star Wars it is no surprise that he puts them all out there again in a 3-D format.  This is the first film chronologically and also the first to hit the theaters.  It's also the worst, regardless of the format.  It was always baffling to me why Lucas would begin a story in the middle but obviously he thought it all through and for better or worse, it all begins here.  Unfortunately, the movie is dumbed down to the lowest common denominator, young kids.  From a marketing and general business practice, I get it but from a critical perspective, I don't.<br /><br />We meet young (11?) Anakin Skywalker (terrible Jake Lloyd) who of course becomes Luke and Leia's father and becomes Darth Vader.  We also meet Anakin's future wife and mother of the siblings, Queen Padme Amidala (lovely but stiff Natalie Portman).  Much has been made of the introduction of the awful Jar Jar Binks character and yes he drove me crazy.  There is also the issue of the warring tribe of droid soldiers and Gungans.  Compare these with the warriors in \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" Childish.<br /><br />There are some moments in the movie however that does stand up.  First, the pod race.  Yes, it has a bizarre comic book look, full of odd-ball non-threatening characters but the race itself is well done both visually and sonically. And it is also the one high point of the 3-D theatrical version.  The other high point was the brief introduction of the original prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the evil emperor Sidious.  Played by Ray Park he is one of the great, but short-lived, characters of the Star Wars saga.  I was also surprised at how quickly Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) is written out of the story line after this episode.<br /><br />As far as the 3-Dness of the theatrical production.  It was definitely toned down, too much I thought for a colorful in-your-face style movie as this.  It doesn't take much away in terms of the viewing but it is darker and of course more expensive.  Is it worth it?  Nope.  For anyone familiar with the Star Wars series your mind is already made up about this first prequel.  Seeing it in 3-D in the theater won't likely change your way of thinking.e.  For anyone familiar with the Star Wars series your mind is already made up about this first prequel.

B006N0YWGY|5.0|This game droped to. 99 so I couldn't resist. Yes you need another set of maps but there's something really fun about running over chickens on a airboat.
B003ZHR6RK|4.0|There are a ton of extras on the Blu Ray.  My gripe is that as you use the arrow keys to move around the choices, the \\"active\\" choice is shown in white and all \\"inactive\\" choices are shown in off-white.  The colors are too close together; sometimes I lose track of what I've got selected and must open/close the disc door to start over again.  Remove that one issue, and I would have given it 5 stars.  Great blu ray picture quality, lots of extras, but a bad user interface

B003ZHR6T8|4.0|I love this movie, but was never happy with the picture quality of the DVD.  The blu ray provides a substantial improvement in picture quality.  If you, like me, don't care much for the DVD picture quality, I recommend you upgrade to blu ray.  IMO, even the blu-ray PQ is lacking some, but perhaps it's the best that can be done with the available source.  I'll give it 4 stars.  Don't expect eye-popping video, but a substantial improvement, and you'll be happy.

B000KX0IOA|5.0|Gandhi represents a true masterpiece in film making, a three hour example of the greatness of the art; Ben Kingsley's performance earned him a well-deserved Oscar for best actor and this film is certainly deserving of its many accolades.<br />Beginning with a view of his assassination and then telling his life story, Gandhi is a thoroughly detailed and complete biography of one of modern history's most influential people.  The story of an Indian lawyer who takes up the cause of equality for Indians, first in South Africa and later in his native India, he ends up disavowing himself of all worldly possessions and devoting his life to the cause of freedom.  Believing in nonviolence and disobedience, he founds a philosophy for the mechanism of social change that will come to have a profound impact on future leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King jr. and Nelson Mandela.  Gandhi's life story is both one of sacrifice and triumph, told beautifully in this film and portrayed by Ben Kingsley with stunning realism and emotion.  A real must see.

B001ILHY2C|5.0|The Blu Ray release of Death Race has two discs in the package, and some extras that are, while not unique, not standard either.<br /><br />First of all, regarding the second disc in the package: You will receive a standard blu-ray case, with two discs inside.  The second disc is a DVD Digital Copy disc (along with a cardboard insert and installation code), not a second Blu Ray disc.  The insert states \\"code may not be valid after 12/31/09\\".  Since that is more than two years ago now, I doubt the digital copy disc will work any longer (I did not try it).  There is no indication on Amazon's site what the second disc is, so now you know for sure.<br /><br />The extras are more than what you get with most Blu Ray discs.  The first clue is that something is different is that a \\"User's Guide to Death Race\\" is included in the package.  Did you ever wonder what those colored buttons on your Blu Ray player's remote control were for?  They're used by this Death Race Blu Ray disc.<br /><br />The value of the extras, like beauty, is \\"in the eye of the beholder\\".  Plug an active internet cable into your Blu Ray player and you can text your buddies while you watch the movie.  Also, in some fashion you can record and share your own commentary.  Both are useless to me, but perhaps you're interested.<br /><br />The disc has your standard (and insightful, imho) audio commentary.<br /><br />Something unusual, and which I find interesting, is a PIP option where, while watching the movie, a second smaller window opens and you get behind-the-scenes information matching what's on the screen at that moment, cast interviews, etc.  This is the only disc I own with this capability.<br /><br />The last extra, called \\"tech specs\\" (I think - going by memory), is something you can bring up while watching the movie.  It brings up details about each driver, their sentence, etc.  Probably not something you'll refer to more than once or twice, but it's a nice add-on for those initial viewings.<br /><br />The extras I've listed above are not an all-inclusive list, but you get the idea: this disc offers something beyond your standard movie, audio commentary, trailers, and featurette release.  The picture quality is very good, too, Accordingly, I rate this release 5 stars.<br /><br />Update June 6, 2012: As my blu-ray collection has increased, I've gotten a couple more discs that have the same or similar \\"unusual special features\\" mentioned above, complete with \\"user's guide\\" documentation.  So it's obvious that a particular company puts these features on their discs, that they are not unique to this movie.  But the above lets you know they're here, anyway.

B0059XTTW8|5.0|Captures the atmosphere of 1070s Britain perfectly, setting the scene for incredibly complex espionage. A thinking person's film, and worth five stars. If I could, I would give it six. Buy one for yourself, and several for friends. Worth the wait until it is released!
B006W0QOF2|2.0|I enjoyed Gosling's character as \\"The Driver,\\" a seemingly subdued suburbanite who is trying to live a quiet life outside of his occasional run-ins with outlaws as a talented premier getaway driver. He is just as apt to take on the role of loving surrogate father as he is apt to smash your face in with a hammer. The beginning of the movie is exciting and establishes who The Driver is and what he does for a living...but then in the middle of the film there is about an hour of scenes with looooooooooooong uncomfortable pauses where the characters literally just stand and stare at eachother, or stand and remain silent in the presence of another...and you find your mind drifting away and wonder \\"is there a point to this?\\"    My wife and I fell asleep on the couch in the middle of it. We woke up during the pawn shop robbery about 90 minutes in. Nothing much happened during that time. If this is supposed to be artsy-fartsy European styling, with apologies to Elvis, we'll take \\"a little less conversation a little more action please...\\"    I'm glad I only spent $1 renting this from redbox.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I'll be honest, upon hearing that Van Halen was putting out a new studio record, I was not overly optimistic.  Until 2012 they had not recorded anything new in 27 years, and other bands who have also waited that long ended up putting out mediocre-at-best new material (namely The Who's 2006 \\"Endless Wire\\" and The Eagles' 2007 \\"Long Road Out of Eden\\").  Thankfully, this is NOT the case with Van Halen.  Their new album kicks!  The music is very melodic, heavy, and entertaining.  David Lee Roth sounds just as good as he ever did.  The lyrics, in most cases, are very catchy and interesting.  The heart and energy the band has maintained through all these years is stunning.  It's like they never went away!  I really like the song \\"Tattoo,\\" which opens the album and is also their new single.  It is very reminiscent of the late-70s era Van Halen and the songs that follow do not fail to measure up to a rocking opening track.  I am a big Van Halen fan, and believe me, this album does not disappoint!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A multi-layered novel, looking at both the utopian goal and our inability to reach it. In some ways a futuristic version of the topics found in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.  A great read.  I did all five books in one weekend.<br />Cheers to the author.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This was one fun movie. If you love Paris ( or at least Paris in color); romance, and have entertained fantasies of spending time with your favorite artists and authors from 'your golden age', then this movie is a must! Woody Allen always has warm tones to his photography and his dialogue and characters are always memorable. This movie is a light, fun trip to Paris for a few days. Also, it's a nice little lesson about contentment. So if you want a colorful escape check this movie out. Also, check out 'Beyond Sunset' by Linklater. The soundtrack is also excellent as usual for WA.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I was fortunate enuf to purchase this, after a great deal of hype and fanfare.... in my honest opinion.... this album is everything and more.... punchy, rocking, frenetic and an absolute delight to my ears...  The quality of the material speaks volumes, some of the more negative pundits pray more on the ideal that most of the material was from the Gene Simmonds sessions back in the late 1970's, however, whether the basics of the songs were founded in the 1970's or 5 months ago, the mood and the scene of this album is very now and very 2012.  The first single 'Tattoo' is commercial and very hook-ey and infectious with its catch-phrase 'from mousewife to momshell in the time it took to get that new Tattoo'...  I'm more of a hard rocking fan than the sweet soft duclit tones - and this album has it all for me... stand-outs (in no particular ordeer of merit) are 'Outaspace'(vintage old-school DLR is on fire  Baby!!), 'Honeybabysweetiedoll', 'She's the woman', 'Bullethead', 'Tattoo','You and your blues', As Is', \\"Blood & Fire' 'The Trouble with Never', 'Beats Workin', 'Stay Frosty' (a modern day uptake on VH1's Ice Cream Man') 'Big River' 'Chinatown' - bottom line here for me - lets just say I dont have a bad banana in this bunch!  Dave is in fine form, not attempting too much of the 'whistle register' screams he became famous for, this style is much more user friendly, Edward's flying fingers & guitar hysterics has never sounded better - he's back and he's bad!!  And the biggest bonus is Wolfgang and Alex Van Halen, provide a solid almost speed metal rhythm edge to the vibe.... the bass and drums has never more in your face!!!! (very prevalent on Outaspace and She's the Woman) - All four of these guys are in the zone.... and the flame is red hot and I'm loving it!!!<br />I was glad on this album the keyboard seems to have made a hasty departure, I waited 28 years to hear this magnum opus.... believe me it was well worth the wait!!!!<br />Get ready people....... theyre baaaaaaaaaack and with a fistful of awesome tunes to assault your ears in the nicest way possible - btw 13 has always been my lucky number!!! and furthermore - Stay Frosty ;)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This one of Stephen King's best books.  I wasn't sure about this one at first.  I didn't want a rehash of conspiracy theories and everything that goes along with that.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was one of those stories that I had a hard time putting down. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the idea of time travel and the consequences brought about by changing the past and the moral issues that go along with it.
B005CYLSW8|5.0|Great set, fantastic sound, and a vision of how the music should be presented. In many ways, Chailly offers nothing new, but a number of elements come together in this set. First, he nods to Toscanini, von Karajan and Gardiner and presents a \\"fourth way.\\" And he really does. If you prize any of the Beethoven of those conductors, this set is a must have: the Toscanini tempos, the von Karajan lushness and muscle, and Gardiner's historic approach. Elements of all those are here. Sure, there are superior versions of these symphonies individually, but I am hard pressed to think of a set which is so consistent throughout. With Overtures too - not just \\"thrown\\" into the mix, but actually \\"thought\\" into it! And in terms of sound, well, not many come this close. I love the Vanska set, but the recorded dynamics are hard to balance on playback; this has none of those issues. Just put it in, set the volume, sit back and enjoy the glorious Decca sound!

B001GQO50I|4.0|If people want to quibble about the sound quality, let them. Sadly, they are missing the point.<br /><br />This is The Doors before they became a phenomenon. When they were still working out their sound. When they were still excited about being a band...even if, as in this show, the crowd wasn't all that excited about them. This is The Doors when Jim Morrison was still polite, for crying out loud.<br /><br />It's about CONTEXT, people. And how often can we hear artists the way the audiences got to hear them before they became legends?  That's what this does, sublimely.<br /><br />Now, out of respect to the hardcore fans bellyaching about sequencing and sound quality, I am docking this one star.<br /><br />However, if a new and improved version of LATM should ever be released, then the world will have a superbulous 5-star musical time capsule we all should be washing down with a glass of Cab, just as Mr. Mojo Risin' would've wanted.

B002BWP49C|5.0|I was a little nervous about how this movie would be done because I loved the book and it seemed as though some scenes-especially Renesmee's birth would be hard to transfer to film, but he did it. I didn't know that Stephanie Myers was directly in on production so that helped I'm sure.  What I really loved about this movie was how emotionally touching it was. Kristen Stewart, in my opinion, did a wonderful job transferring the feelings of Bella which drove the story.  Her performance along with the musical score really did it for me. The two particular scenes that touched me were the wedding-how she was so awkward, nervous and fidgety as she started down the aisle with her father and then when she sees Edward, her face, composure and the atmosphere just change just as it was described in the book.  Not to mention that gorgeous dress!  And the end.  The way the transformation was done showing the end of one journey and the beginning of another was just very moving and well done.  Oh, and the song \\"It Would Rain\\" fits the end so perfectly
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really appreciate the combination of downloadable and online Bibles available in this application. I can download one of the free Bibles and use it anywhere or I can read any number of free online Bibles. I like the way font sizes can be changed (I like a larger font). A lot of the Bibles have audio versions available to listen to even as you read. I wrote an email twice and received replies very quickly. Excellent!
B0015DYIH2|3.0|The world that Twilight exists in is mesmerizing and deliciously inviting. The average is turned into the extraordinary; what would sparkle explodes into passion and pain. This writing isn't good and there is much left to want and that could be better developed, but for the right people this world is like crack and once your hooked, you just want to be there in it and reread every word (painful lacking or not) so you can feel the high of living a romantic adventure.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|You can chunk this in that pile of `films to make you hate white people', for `The Help' really exposes to our generation the cruelty and just plain overwhelming ignorance of our forefathers.  Yes, racism is in full swing in this recent adaptation (and current Oscar contender), adapted from the bestselling novel of the same name.  That isn't to say that `The Help' is a complete downer of a film, because at its heart this is an inspirational (of sorts) film filled with love, hope, redemption and humor.<br /><br />But MY GOD this script is all sorts of awful.<br /><br />I'm just going to get out with the obvious.  `The Help' is rather mediocre.  The dialog is simplistic, the character development is minimal, the characterizations are complete clich&eacute;s and overblown caricatures and the actual plot is somewhat insulting in a way.  I can't get behind Hollywood's fixation on seeking white redemption through a barrage of race-related films where the sole savior of the black race is that one white person who sees through it all.  I mean, I know that not all whites were evil (and I'm white, so don't think that I'm coming from another vantage point here) but it is somewhat ridiculous that blacks are so often portrayed as helpless in these types of films.  They lack all convictions and courage until some bullheaded white person stokes their fire.  Sure, the fact of the matter is that these poor people were segregated in a `white world' and thus at the mercy of ignorant fools who thought so little of them as a whole, but they fought for their own rights and they made the difference for themselves.  `The Help' tries to spin that thought process towards the end, especially with regards to Aibileen, but this is certainly centered around Skeeter and the difference `she' made.<br /><br />With that said, the acting here is largely triumphant and thanks to the dedicated performances, this film shines brightly.<br /><br />Viola Davis is phenomenal as Aibileen.  The way she evokes such rich emotional depths in a film that is surrounded with shallowness is remarkable.  Jessica Chastain is funny, bubbly and, at her core, shatteringly heartbreaking.  Her loneliness and despair is masked by her airheaded demeanor, and she colors all her shades very well.  Octavia Spencer is witty and grounded as the comic relief here, and while I didn't find the depth I wanted to in her performance, she absolutely delivers the best line readings here.  Bryce Dallas Howard plays a ridiculous clich&eacute; of a woman, hardened and horrible, and yet she nails the tone perfectly.  And then you have a handful of smaller roles, all played with conviction and earnestness.  Sissy Spacek is hilarious and memorable, Allison Janney is the perfect springboard for Emma Stone's character and Cicely Tyson is heartbreakingly sincere as the film's core emotional impact.  Sadly, it girl Emma Stone is somewhat of an afterthought, completely engulfed by the more vibrant characters around her.<br /><br />If you are looking for a more empowering look at the struggle for equality and the fight to be heard, watch 1990's `The Long Walk Home'.  `The Help' is more colorful, sure, and the acting as an ensemble is more enriched here, but the script is rather messy and really drags down the film's central themes in the process.<br /><br />That said; I'm completely Team Viola come Oscar night!surrounded with shallowness is remarkable.

B0071QIN00|1.0|I really don't like how you almost cant beat the levels, and whenever you almost get to a checkpoint it glitches up and then you cant get to it.  Also the fact that the angles of the ramps are so dumb because whenever you go up the ramp you usually just run into it and fail... DO NOT GET THIS APP
B0041KKYEM|1.0|Every once in a while a film comes along which receives much praise and when I finally get around to seeing it I can't for the life of me even begin to understand why. (another recent example was HBO's \\"Mildred Pierce\\") It's like \\"the emperor's new clothes\\", I wonder if I'm even seeing the same film everyone else saw.  Well, this WAS the same BLACK SWAN that everybody else saw, and, well, unless you have a fetish for bleeding fingernails, or wish to see Natalie Portman waste her talents on simpering, sobbing and whining... well, watch the original THE RED SHOES for some stylishly overwrought, obsessive, fever-pitch ballet high drama.  BLACK SWAN is muddy-looking and has none of the visual flair which might make watching a self-obsessed character lose her grip the least bit enthralling.  The only purpose I can see this serving is to scare parents into keeping their children OUT of ballet academies.

B0071T5PN0|4.0|Van Halen is back!!! The old school \\"let's just have fun and rock\\" is back!!! Although I am also a Michael fan, (my son is named Michael Anthony) I can't help but have the same feelings I had back when I first heard my first VH song!!! Original front man Diamond Dave is the best in the business!!! And you can hear that Eddie and Alex are having fun again!!! It is about the music and the music is great!! A nice return to the roots that got them where they are today!!!  I have seen all versions of Van Halen in concert, and won't miss this one!!! I already have my tickets in hand and can't wait!!! Of course, I won't miss Chickenfoot this year either!!!!  Great album!!! At least 6 Top 40 songs on one album in my honest opinion!!! Not many artist can even wish for that kind of success!!! Much less something 30+ years deep in their career!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob is a legal thriller that pulls you in quickly and doesn't let go until the last page.  There are many great books in this genre, but Defending Jacob is one of the very few that stays with you when you are finished.  I finished the book late in the evening a few days ago and I'm still analyzing the characters and major plot points in my mind.  The basics of the story are almost too simple:  A district attorney's 14 year-old son is accused of murdering a classmate and the DA is called upon to \\"defend him\\".  What sets this apart from other novels in this genre is the authenticity not only in the courtroom dramas, but more importantly, between the characters themselves.  When Andy argues with his wife, Laurie, I felt as if I was arguing with my wife: it was that real.  The characters in this story are flawed - terribly so in some cases - but so authentically human that I felt as if I was in the room next to them.  This is a story that will stay with you for a long time.  It's probably one of the best legal thrillers written in the last several years.
B0071QIN00|5.0|I love this game because &quot; its fun and challenging .it also has levels. that get harder each time I m on level 10.trust me its worth the money
B006UG90RM|5.0|There are a lot of good reviews already posted here, including the one on VHND.com  My $.02 is that VH pays homage to the past but, more importantly, has found a new 'voice' for itself -- i.e. \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll' -- which is so critical if the Mighty VH wants to stay relevant not only with its fan base from the 80's and 90's but also today's younger rock audience.

1594744769|4.0|I read this book, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, on my Kindle Fire, and for the most part I found it delightful.  At the time I selected the book, I anticipated a different type of story.  But I was pleasantly surprised by book's story.  I tend to adore any story based on fantasy, especially when it starts with a feel of realistic stories.  This book had me enveloped in the story quite early on, and frankly I could hardly put it down.  About one-half way through the story, however, I began to lose a bit of interest, but not much.  Contrary to other reviews of this book, I enjoyed the addition of the old photographs -- I found that they were a nice added touch that allowed me to size up the writer's thoughts of the photos and compare them with my own.  I do feel that I wish the story had come full circle and had full closure at the end, but if that were the case then I wouldn't be excited about a 2nd book to catch up on more of the story!  I would have given this book a 5 star rating if it were not for the changes in the middle of the book that failed to grab and hold my attention like the early chapters maintained.  In addition, there were several words used in the book that I had to stop and define because they were too obscure for me (thank Goodness Kindle Fire makes this an easy task).  I do recommend the book, it's one of the most pleasurable books I've read in quite a while!
B0070YDOT8|4.0|Test devices:<br />Samsung Epic, Android 2.3 official<br />Viewsonic gTablet, FrankenTab (Android 2.2)<br /><br />Starting with [[ASIN:B004RR7KCS Card Ace: Blackjack]], I've been quite a fan of the title from Self Aware Games.  Card Ace: Casino is their third installment of the Card Ace series, which also includes [[ASIN:B004RR82L6 Card Ace: Hold 'em Poker]].  As with the previous two games, Card Ace: Casino is free to play.  Each you day play, you get free chips to play with, and of course can buy more. (Note, Card Ace games are free of ads.  The purchase of chips is the only monetary support for Self Aware Games.)  While you can continue using the standalone versions of Blackjack and Hold'em, Casino makes them obsolete as it includes both.  Upon install, Casino will pull your profile data over so you're not starting from scratch, including all your achievements, pics, and chips.  Casino also includes a couple new games, which are Slots and Word Ace.<br /><br />As with the previous released, Casino's graphics are nicely detailed.  Not \\"OMG!  That's amazing!\\" level, but very nice.  It also scaled up on my tablet's 10\\" screen much better than the older two titles, using 3/4 of the screen vs 1/4.  The soundtrack and sound effects are loungy, adding to the general feel of the game.  Casino does seem to suffer a bit in terms of performance, compared to the other two.  Little hesitations here and there in the gameplay, slow loading images, and the like.  This lag doesn't destroy the gameplay, but it does detract from it a bit.  Hopefully Self Aware can tighten up the code a bit and squeeze some more speed out of it.<br /><br />Now, the lag is one issue I mentioned, which is partially responsible for the loss of one star in the rating.  The other thing I'm not fond of is how accounts are handled with Self Aware.  There is no login name or password.  Instead, you're assigned a Friend ID number.  That's ok, if you're only playing on one device and it's a brand new device that wasn't owned before.  If you play on more than one device, like me, things can get a little hairy.  The initial install of Casino, and its mates, on my tablet resulted in me having access to someone else's account instead of a fresh new one or my own.  I could change their name and pictures, blow their chips on wild bets, add and remove friends, etc.  Totally not cool.  I was able to get it sorted out by contacting Self Aware, which involved them transferring accounts around and me uninstalling and reinstalling the apps on both phone and tablet.  It took a few days, but it's been working ok since.  My point though is that if Self Aware used login name and passwords, this sort of thing wouldn't happen.n more than one device, like me, things can get a little hairy.

0793518326|1.0|When this boxed, hard-bound volume arrived, I thought it was a bit on the small side to use for reading music, and my disappointment deepened when I opened the book.  The paper is of lesser quality, the printing is small and also of less than distinctive quality.  On the plus side, this volume would probably satisfy a collector but not someone who wanted to use it to perform music.  Historical record perhaps but not a useful publication for a musician to use

B005OOSPZO|3.0|Great movie. Its a shame Hollywood feels the need to change history, which they do quite often, by making the statement by the Japanese Admiral Yamamoto about the time they were too bomb Pearl Harbor. The Japanese had nothing to do with the Geneva Convention during 1941, so to say they were to bomb at 0830 to abide by it was incorrect. It wasnt till 1942 that the Japanese Empire signed the accord. Shame on Hollywood trying to lighten what the Japanese did to our country.

B0040UAYI4|5.0|I've played every installation of the Battlefield series on PC, since those days my PC (and my wallet) just can't keep up with the demands of newer games so naturally I've switched over to console gaming.  No matter how hard I try to accept console gaming via the controllers... it just doesn't work for me.  I can't stand the lack of control!  I felt as though I was  playing as a 90 year old man with ankle weights running around a battlefield... it was just plain lame and I couldn't have fun.  I was looking for answers to find a means in which I might be able to enjoy Battlefield 3 much like I did for the PC versions of the game.  Guys and Gals... Eagle Eye is the answer.  If you're a gamer who is used to keyboard and mouse controls and is completely frustrated by using the dualshock controllers... the Eagle Eye is for you.  After carefully calibrating the adapter to best suit my preference of sensitivity of movement, I must say I'm impressed very much by this product.  I'll be using the Eagle Eye for all of my FPS games and destroying the competition just like the old days on PC!  This is the future of console gaming for me and I couldn't be more excited!  After a little practice with this baby you feel as though the experience emulates that of a PC's performance to nearly 95%.  Its not EXACTLY like a PC, but it is VERY close.  I'm recommending the Eagle Eye to ALL of my friends who have switched from PC gaming to console.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I just wanted the movies to share with grandkids, and this set is ideal! The kids are old enough to play them for themselves, and there is no extra information, which might be interesting to me, but that the children might not be patient enough to watch. This product was exactly what I needed, and is beautifully packaged.
0783233477|5.0|This film benefits from a little fast forwarding (the kiss in the library, the sex scene), but overall it is very good and has a very touching ending.  I normally don't go in for the supernatural, but this movie is good.  The acting is excellent.  At points Brad Pitt seems a little odd with the childlike stuff but in the end it all works very well.  I would defintely recommend it.  Remember, it is a romantic movie.  Kudos to the cast and the director.  Good sets too.

B006UG90RM|3.0|It's been awhile since there has been a release as highly anticipated as this one. while I'm not gonna break down track by track reviews,I will say that I was a marginal VH fan at best,during both incarnations,so maybe that's why I'm not blown away by this new one. If you are a diehard fan,you will probably love it,to the casual fan,it is just average. I think it is a step below the most recent releases of other bands from that era,such as Whitesnake,Ratt,and the Scorpions,but that is my opinion. I will say that there are some good solos by EVH,but that is to be expected.If you are a fan,pick it up.I don't think it will convert you if you are on the fence though.

B005QJZ5FA|4.0|The way Lana Del Rey's talking/singing vocals float above the music, reminds me of Morrissey's vocals with The Smiths. Similarly, the songs on Born to Die can at first seem very similar. What emerges is an interesting amalgam: she sings low with a voice of a mature woman, which she offsets with her high girlish rapping. The songs are on-going episodes in the process of romantic/sexual maturation.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Very, very good.  I watched with my son, a police officer and he thought this was an excellent movie also.  I love that Christian values are in this movie.  Hope more come out like this.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|It sounds like you get 101 games off the bat, then you unlock 20 more. Not true, to my disappointment. You get ten. You unlock the rest by reaching a certain score in lower level games, to get points that you use to unlock other games. But honestly, they're not really worth it. they're all one level, with no change, so you keep playing the same stuff over and over. Then, the instructions aren't the greatest either. Plus there are ads galore, which are stored on my phone, as I still see them in airplane mode. If it was 101 decent multi-level games, I wouldn't care about the other 20, or the ads, or the lackluster instructions. But I find these games pretty boring. I'm uninstalling this app, considering updating lost what accomplishments I had achieved. It's just not worth it.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is great! the layout is very basic and easy to refer back to and read. Its so appealing to the eye that the app makes you want to have a reason to take notes. The app is excellent for taking notes. Even when i thought that they need a way to draw an image into notes, I found that you can down load an app to evernote to draw things! they didn't miss a thing. Hopefully ever note will make a way to draw in math equations at a small font size. (just like writing in Nb) choose Evernote!

I have read it several times, and each time I come away with something new! Excellent!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I must say I was pleasantly surprised on how GOOD this DVD was. I have seen the show 3 times, in London,New York & Las Vegas and this production can stand up with them. Cast sounds great and the staging is very good considering what they had to work with. Anyone who has seen the play will enjoy this over and over, and for those who haven't this is a great opportunity to see the play version. The celebration after the show with Andrew Lloyd Webber and some of the original cast including Michael Crawford & Sarah Brightman is priceless although Crawford does not sing. Brightman sings a song with 5 actors who have played the Phantom. Needless to say I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you buy this.
1592402690|5.0|Geoff Emerick writes as if he is still there. it is so clear and detailed. A must-read for anyone who records music.

This album is the best Rock album in 15+ years.  Anyone that says differently don't know what Van Halen Rock is really about.  Van Halen, thank you for such a great album.  One word sums up this album \\"AMAZING\\".  Go buy it.

B000URDEB0|4.0|With me, I listened to Imaginaerum before any other Nightwish albums and was blown away. I heard this album, and I'll say that I really like it, even though this one is more of a pop rock album.  I actually feel that most of the album is about the breakup and recreation of Nightwish. The lyrics to The Poet and the Pendulum were amazing. I disagree that this song was about Tarja. It was about Tuomas Holopainen and the stuff he went through when the band broke up. Now Bye Bye Beautiful is definitely about Tarja.  I loved the orchestration. They created the music in a way where the orchestra blends well with the rock. I feel that Anette actually does carry the songs well in the Album version. I heard it may not be the case live.  The band in this album actually sounds like they have been unleashed. As Nightwish has said, it sounds like they went to a lot of extremes. I agree, because this music gets incredibly heavy, but then bounces to light pop. The lyrics in the light pop songs are pretty basic, but at the same time, thanks to the arrangement and orchestration, sound amazing.  As a first album with the new sound, it's good. They will have to refine their music more before they get it just right. They are heading in the right direction with Imaginaerum. I also feel like they are trying out a lot of different styles now given the opportunity, and really pushed things.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am loving this cover! It fits perfectly, and I love how it offers protection all around. I haven't used the prop feature yet, so I can't offer too much insight on how that part holds up, but otherwise I love it!
0393338398|4.0|The only reason why I bought this book is because it was suppose to be starring one, William Bradley Pitt. That's Brad Pitt for you casual fans. To my disappointment, there was not a single picture of him in the book. It was all filled with only words! Looks like I'll just be watching Thelma & Louise over and over again. Because the book was still based off of Brad Pitt's time as the GM of the Oakland A's, I went ahead and gave it 4 stars.
159562015X|4.0|I was very pleased with the condition of this used book.  I have not yet read it, but I plan to read it soon.  If you have no qualms with a book that has been read before then I highly recommend checking out used books before you pony up for the price of new.  Really, what does it matter?
B0002F6AH0|5.0|When it comes to World War II documentaries, there is one that is in a class by itself: \\"The World at War.\\" It debuted on television more than three decades ago, and there have been none before or since to equal it in stature.<br /><br />There is the obligatory real war footage required of every documentary, but this goes further with Sir Lawrence Olivier's superb narration throughout this multi-hour series.  There are interviews with luminaries of the day, ordinary citizens and military personnel from all ranks and sides of the Axis or Allies.  Averill Harriman's information is just as exciting as the account from the woman who was a part of the Dutch Underground.<br /><br />The imagery is a pleasure to behold. We see modern day image in color pictures of a forest. It is of the Ardennes, and Sir Lawrence Olivier calmly relates that this is the road the Germans came down. But the road is innocent and green looking. It doesn't hold danger until we are introduced to the black and white of 1940 watching German panzers raising an angry cloud of dust over French terrain and troops feverishly fording a river.<br /><br />The camera and sound are masterful, sometimes showing the lone sound of footsteps hurrying toward an air raid shelter, or the sound of refugee's cart wheel over cobblestone road. These sounds are magnified.  It adds to the uncertainty of life in war, and the eeriness of the death it brings. Oddly it adds a sense of urgency to movement and brings a \\"present quality\\" to an event of the past.<br /><br />The opening and ending of the film has its own intrigue. The music sounds a bit alarming and classical, and its last strains blend with the photography that offers a collage of images that morph into that of a little boy whose face is locked in fear not comprehending the madness around him.  The music is not of great variety, but adds its own suspense at the right moment when you expect a major invasion to begin, or the tap, tap, tap that comes with the boredom of being in a far off place, yet still on a precipice of danger.<br /><br />There is no part of the world that is not explored in \\"The World at War.\\" It will have something about the invasion of the Aleutians or the mud of Guadalcanal, the Battle of Britain, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the abject misery on the Steppes of Russia, or what it was like to be on a merchant vessel in convoy crossing the Atlantic.<br /><br />Think about it! Since this production, there has been surround sound, high definition TV, computer imagery, and none of these innovations can equal this saga made so long ago. That's why superlatives like \\"in a class by itself,\\" or \\"unparalleled,\\" are reserved for feats like these.<br /><br />If you could only see one documentary of World War II, this would be the one to see.on a precipice of danger.

B006W0QOF2|5.0|Ok..From all of the reviews you've been reading so far..you, by now, know that this is not a movie about car chase scenes and half naked bimbo's.  It's a movie with real substance.  It kicks your ass and leaves you breathless.  It's about people wanting better for themselves, but just can't break away from the rut they're in.  I'm just going to say it..if you didn't \\"get\\" this movie then you're an idiot who should stick to watching transformers and chewing bubble gum (I'd be surprised if you could do both at the same time)
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Before all the hip hop, there was a lady and a true songbird by the name of Whitney whose elegance was evident in her style and grace and whose effortless vocals sent shivers down one's spine.  Her rendition of the Spar Spangled Banner was flawless and remains unparalleled to this day.  I remember hearing the  single, \\"I Look To You\\" on the radio when it first aired.  I  had to pull over.  I was so overcome by the fact that even after all her struggle, she still had \\"it.\\"  You have to listen without bias, without preconceived notions and let go the former impressions of the young Whitney.  This is the elder statesman, if you will, making her final bow and telling you a bit about her newfound strength with an understanding of her own weaknesses and faults.  Listen!  This is not the young Whitney, vying for your approval.  She knows she is nearing the end of her career and yet she has a few more things to share for those who still want to listen.  God graced her vocal chords one last time with more soul and humanity, in spite of it all.  There will never be another \\"Voice\\" like Miss Houston.  Larry King compared her to Judy Garland in that they both had the innate ability to make the listener feel what they were singing because their life was in their voice.  Billie Holiday possessed the same gifting.  May she now rest in peace and all prayers and positive thoughts go out to her Mother, Cissy Houston and 19 year old daughter, Bobbi Kristina Houston.  Thanks for all the memories and beautiful music, Miss Houston. Your music and style will live on.
0307957934|3.0|After reading the book, I heard an interview with Mr. Harris on NPR.  There seems to be some divergence between the story he'd envisioned and the one that made it to print.  To be clear, this is a fun mystery.  I read it in a single day, and would have been happy enough if I'd had it on a long flight.  Mr. Harris is a great storyteller, and the plot advances well enough to keep the pages turning.  That said, I was disappointed in the fact that I could not find an empathetic link with the characters.  They are barely developed as individuals about whom I cared.  In other words, I wanted to know how the plot developed, but I didn't really care what happened to the players.
B004EPYZSU|1.0|SPOILERS (to prevent you from watching this turd)  What a piece of crap! Hollywood wants me to accept that there aliens in the old west, but at the same time wants me to take the concept, story, and characters very seriously like it's some important piece of film. Where's the humor? Where's the narrative drive? Why are there so many pointless characters? Why does the movie grind to a lifeless halt every 15 minutes? Has Daniel Craig ever been more boring? Why isn't he freaking out about everything that's happening to him? Why spend half an hour setting up a bunch of characters and relationships only to have them disappear for the rest of the movie? Why waste Paul Dano like that after he creates the most interesting character in the film? Why is there a dog in the movie? Why is there a stupid little kid in the movie? Why is everyone so ridiculously macho? Where's the awe and wonder at the discovery of things never before known to man? What does the theme of people accepting each other for their differences have anything to do with anything else happening in this film? Why does Favreau's direction defeat the humor and character in every scene? Why are the action scenes so dreadfully boring? Where's the setup and payoff of anything? Why are the aliens so stupid, and what do they have to do with anything? If the aliens want to capture us for research, then why are they killing everyone? Why do the aliens want gold, and why don't they just go get it from some bank vault? Why is there a ship in the desert just like in \\"Close Encounters?\\" Why does the alien's holding pen look exactly like the one in \\"Super 8?\\"  Why hasn't Harrison Ford made a good movie since \\"The Fugitive?\\" But most importantly, WHY ISN'T THERE ANYTHING FUN happening in this movie so we can enjoy ourselves? What's the point of making this movie if the audience can't go along for the ride? It's just one cliche meeting another cliche and making a duller cliche. The only people that seem to like it are the ones that are happy to just see anything resembling a western. Jon Favreau has the world on a plate and he gives us this massive turd. It's the perfect example of why Hollywood summer movies should die, and an absolute waste of the talents of everybody involved.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|This was a superb psychological thriller that the elements really kept changing the further you got into the book.  I would have never dreamed of reading the ending that I read while reading the first or even the tenth or eighteenth chapter!  This was my first read from Lisa Gardner as well as of the D.D. Warren series, and I can assure you that I will be reading the next book in the series, Hide and as a matter of fact, I can't wait! I finished the book hours ago and it still has my head reeling!  It's been a long time since I've read such an overall AWESOME book!  I know you all will thoroughly enjoy it!

0545259088|4.0|I have to admit that I was quite pleased with the resolutions presented in the Mercy Falls Trilogy by Maggie Stiefvater. I like the fact that I could still use my imagination and create the ending that I wanted for Sam and Grace.  While some may not appreciate the vague ending, or loose endings, I did because it allowed me to create Sam and Grace's happily ever after in my own mind. I believe I know and understand Stiefvater's intent and give her an \\"A\\" in execution. Unlike Meyer, who tried to wrap the Twilight series so neatly, Stiefvater leaves just a little uncertainty.....  This installment in the series picks up where Linger ended. Grace has been missing for some time, having been turned into a wolf in an effort to save her life. Sam on the other hand, is not just heartbroken and lonely but questioning all that he is. He is at a loss of what to do since Beck (his mentor and father figure) is missing having turned into a wolf the year before; his soul mate (Grace) is now a wolf; Isabel's father is still after the wolves and planning a hunt that will end their lives; Grace's parents and the police believe that Sam is responsible for not only Grace's disappearance, but Grace's friend Olivia; Cole (the missing infamous rock star) is still looking for a cure that will keep those who want it in their own skin (human or wolf); not to mention some wolf has attached and killed a woman in the woods.  What I enjoy most about Stiefvater's novels are the beautiful, lyrical words that seem to come right off the page filling your mind with tons of wonderful images. Whether it is the description of the woods, Sam's beguiling yellow eyes, Sam's poetry and songs, or the words that describe the romance between Sam and Grace or Cole and Isabel...the reader is transported to fascinating world of Mercy Falls. While I would have loved just a bit more of Cole and Isabel, I too was able to come up with my own happily ever after as well. And for those who have fallen in love with the series, they will enjoy \\"Forever\\".
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|My husband bought this CD for us. I'd never heard of the band, but we listened to it on a recent road trip and really dug it.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|anyone see the movie babel ? that's what i said when me and my friends found it in the 2$  bin at the pawn shop. we  found it was really disappointing. it could have been 40 min shorter to tell the same story. acting was good. story dragged along. it seems the writer loosely stitched the stories together and used a gimmick to to tie them together. boring story nothing that really challenges any grand narritves . the Japanese is of course a school girl the Arab is a goat herder . and other cliche stereotypes . you get the point. the japan teenagers playing montage was a somewhat rip off of lost in translation. we find out the Americans end up ok.. thank god. they matter. we never find out about the arab family .who cares the film tells us. i felt ripped off. i went to the internet to see how this movie was marketed , according to wiki the movie was billed as somewhat PO- ( postmodern and thought provoking i found this quote from tis Wikipedia page  really funny  \\"These parallels contribute to building a content/message of human connectivity, and the inherent incalculable causality of individual actions.\\" what a load of nonsense. you can make the argument every film .  because any film that has a character and a plot is about individuality actions and causality .people get paid to make this crap and write it. marketing this faux intellectual rubbish. don't bother with this . its  a very intelligence insulting film
B00004ST9Q|5.0|I just bought this a year ago to replace my missing VCD counterpart and I was so shocked and saddened to hear that Whitney Houston had died suddenly in her hotel room.<br /><br />Whitney was the VOICE. She was such a joy to listen to and always had such a bright smile to bring cheer to your day.<br /><br />This is her only video collection. There's another one with a different cover (cover shot of The Ultimate Collection CD) but the contents are identical.<br /><br />Most of her videos are here. Bonus features includes some live performances such as the Grammy's One Moment In Time and MTV's Why Does It Hurt So Bad? I don't know if there are clips for All At Once, Love Will Save The Day and Miracle. If so, Sony could put out a full collection soon. Do include Exhale.<br /><br />This is a great collection to remember Whitney Houston by. I just can't believe she's gone. May her music legacy live on forever. Whitney, you will always have a special place in my heart. You are the greatest voice of all!<br /><br />PS: I recently chanced upon the US edition. Compared to the international version reviewed above, the US release contains the videos for Exhale and I Believe In You And Me. Also included is the US version of I'm Your Baby Tonight. The song is a different from the international dance version. The video varies slightly with the international version containing a piano sequence.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|Overproduced pop trash.  Run away.  Everything on this album is regrettable.  \\"Someone Like You\\" may be the worst song ever written and recorded.
0060555661|5.0|Excellent book, very well written, informative and educational. It is everything that one could expect of the book that have guided Mr. Warren Buffet on the start of his career as mega-investor. Highly recommended.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|After I read the first book, I had to get my hands on the second one! Instead of waiting FOREVER to get it through the library, I bought it on my kindle! Wise choice! :)I went into this book not sure what to expect, since the last book left me hanging on a cliff! There were so many twists and turns in this book, it had me guessing all the way through! Cassia really grows even more in this book. Cassia is a strong character to begin with but she is able to stand firm in her beliefs in this book. I really like Indie who is a new character in this book,she is strong like Cassia and knows what she wants, but at the same time she has a hard time not knowing who to trust! I loved Ky in this book. Wow! He has been through so much from the beginning but I loved hearing his story and how much had to let go and all that he did let go towards the end of the book. For Ky Cassia is everything to him and he can't stand and still can't stand the thought of loosing her. Through out the book there were times I wasn't sure if they would be together because of all the obstacles they both had to over come to get to each other. I loved all of the Ky Cassia moments so sweet, but at the same time bitter sweet too. For Cassia all she wants is Ky too, but she can't help wanting to see Xander again. Cassia really is torn between the two of them. Indie on the other hand talks to Cassia and tells her she really needs to choose, in which we come to find out that Indie is in love with Xander, but I feel she is in love with the idea of him, not in love with him. I agree with Indie because it really is not fair to Ky or Xander. There are other characters that are introduced in this book that I really like. Eli is a lot like Cassia's brother Bram, sweet, kind and wants the best for everyone, but has some rebellion in him. I am glad that Ky takes Eli under his wing. Ky did this in the outer provinces more out of guilt, or because he reminds him of Bram, but he does it also because he cares enough what happens to him. Hunter is the other new Character. I like Hunter, he really does put his neck out on the line to help everyone. I do hope that we will see Eli and Hunter again in the next book. I loved how the end was bitter sweet but at the same time not too much of a cliff hanger, since they are all now working for the Rising!! I can't wait to see what happens next!at happens to him. Hunter is the other new Character. I like Hunter, he really does put his neck out on the line to help everyone. I do hope that we will see Eli and Hunter again in the next book.

B006PZBR8S|1.0|If only there were a zero star option.  This movie has been described as Rocky with robots...this it is not.  The movie requires the complete suspension of belief from the very first scene...and not just some of the technology in a futuristic world.  I had so much to say while watching the movie, but it's taken away my will.  I will say that I am a huge fan of science fiction, and this movie had a lot of potential.  It in actuality was a travesty.  It hurts the reputation of Spielberg and Jackman.  There are movies made for 11 year old's that adults can enjoy...that wasn't even attempted here.  Do yourself a favor and take a nap while the little ones watch this...unless you want to instill an appreciation for quality cinema in them.  In that case rent something else.
B006UG90RM|5.0|The album rocks - all on levels. I could care less who or when the tracks originated - it smacks of vintage Van Halen. That is not a bad thing. Sucks it took so long for them to put something out. And I miss Michael Anthony too. Can't wait for their concert this spring. Stay Frosty.

1400069289|5.0|This book was supremely interesting. I love delving into the whys and hows of psychology-type topics. As a result, this book was perfect for me.<br /><br />The first third of the book is dedicated to Individuals. The author details how habits work, how to create new habits, and why these changes happen. Concrete examples back up everything that is said, including the classic rodent in a maze scenario. This makes reading and understanding the concepts very easy - it's not a new concept, it's just laid out before you, ready for you to take in the knowledge. Because this part of the book was far more relatable, it was by far my favorite.<br /><br />The middle portion of the book focuses primarily on businesses. Again, concrete examples reign, making for an easy read. This section details more on leadership and teamwork, automating habits, and how to recognize habits of others.<br /><br />The final section of the book is specifically about societies at large. While less interesting still, the points made are still interesting and well-thought-out.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this book. I hope to put my new-found knowledge to good use in the near future.
0307959856|1.0|This book is not good. I'm actually really upset I had to pay for it because I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! I haven't read any of this authors other stories so their other books might be good, but this isn't. I don't know how much research this author did, but there is some inaccurate information as how the people are related. I think there is also some presumptuous inferences made(how Charlotte someone resents Elizabeth's reaction to the marriage between Charlotte and Mr Collins) and the author also uses other Austen novels as asides in the story. I'm 60% (i read it on the fire) through this story and would stop if it wasn't a book club book. This is probably my 4th or 5th Austen \\"adaption\\" and this is by far the WORST. Don't pay for this book, if you feel like you want to read it wait for it from the library. I don't usually write reviews on Amazon but if this review saves people the 15 bucks I paid for it... or even less then it has been worth my time.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Amazon really pulled through on this on. I pre-ordered this so I wouldn't have to drive 45 miles to the nearest Walmart and the EDD (estimated delivery date) was for the 13th, it was released the 11th, which was no problem but I actually received it on the 11th. It was such a great surprise. This Twilight is what got me hooked. Before I watched this I did see the three from before and didn't really care for it so when my sister-in-law invited me to the movies to watch it with her I was a little hesitant. I am so glad I went. I got the books that next day and read all 4 of them in a month. I can't wait til the next one comes out. So worth buying!!! Thank you Amazon for getting it to me early. :D
1592402690|5.0|Great book. The picture of what went into recording the music of the Beatles is fascinating and what makes this book stand out. The inside stories are wonderful. His descriptions of the Beatles are filled with admiration and praise at some points, brutally honest at others, but ultimately seem fair, from the perspective of someone who was there. Best Beatles book I have read.

B004XWLN20|5.0|I followed this series with my 2 sons who are in the comic industry. I watched it now and then but always heard them talking. It just kept getting more and more exciting.I did want to own this but I kept thinking at what it would cost so I shied away. Then this collection became available and I jumped on it. Now I'm going to get my wife to watch it. She says there is only one SUPERMAN and that's Christopher Reeve so she hasn't watched it YET.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I wasn't sure after hearing the first release \\"Tattoo\\", but after getting the disc & listening all the way through......this just may be the best Van Halen album ever!  There are so many hard charging, straight up rock songs that it's hard to pick a favorite.  \\"As-Is\\" is an instant classic. So is \\"Stay Frosty\\".....not sure why Spammy's fans felt the need to post negative reviews. This album rocks!!

0143119680|1.0|I read this book, hoping to like it: Vampires, Witches, a grand mystery. What I didn't know before hand is that it is mainly a romance. What I also didn't know until many hours of slogging through the bodice ripping, is that it doesn't really end. Why? It's a TRILOGY! No thanks...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|By now most people interested already have an idea of the setting and story. What is hard to portray in a review is just how addictive the book is from the first few pages, and how well it handles the inevitable death within. It has gory deaths, but they are treated in a way that feels mature. The entire book makes me think of a violent Pixar film; appropriate for all ages, without the pandering that worse stories use. Post-apocalyptic settings and reality-show type death games have been everywhere in media for the last decade; and this easily stands out as one of the best representations.
0307891372|5.0|This book is fantastic!!!! I am a 32 year old dad who grew up with atari, intelevision, and the original Mario bros on Nintendo. I can't seem to stop playing video games as I age. I played rpg games as a child and turned to mostly sports games as I aged. When I saw Skyrim I was intrigued to say the least and went out and bought it. I didn't buy this book to cheat or skip forward to beat the game faster. I bought this book with the game so I wouldn't miss important weapons or quests and I could play the entirety of the game to get the fullest experience. THIS BOOK DOES THAT AND MORE!!! It is everything I wished it could be and more. Thank you to the writers of this book as it has made Skyrim a better experience all around for me!!!
B001AQMBNC|5.0|What a great value for this timeless flick, one which gets you thinking about life elsewhere in this universe, which I am a fervent believer that the universe is much like the earth itself, simply festooned with life-filled planets, enough so that the number probably exceeds the amount of grains of sand on our planet.
B004EXLDFU|5.0|This is one of the best episodes of the show.  Olivia finally comes back.  I had been hoping that Olivia would come back all season.

So, I'm pleased with the seller and the quality that is exactly as promised it would be.

B001AQT0RC|5.0|I loved Carl Sagan & his wife Ann Druyere when they were full of life and Carl's many books were on everyone's reading lists.  He was an exobiologist by his own description, not questioning life elsewhere in this fecund universe, but simply studying ways of discovering it and overcoming the obstacle of pure vastness.  Contact is a stimulating movie about mankind's place in the cosmos, and one of my very favorite flicks of all time.  Jody Foster is so credible as the determined, steadfast and dedicated explorer of otherworldly life.  The issue of theism also weaves threads throughout the movie, which is a healthy intellectual discussion as well.  Good Stuff.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Nice to see a rock album.  I didn't think those existed anymore.  The songs are much better than I expected.  I've already played through the CD several times.
B005VPRG10|4.0|This TIE Fighter was a great build. I have several minifig scale Star Wars models and a big fan of this one. It's a great recreation from the movie and has a lot of detail. As always the instructions were easy to follow, and I really like the numbered bags for a more structured build. I'm not sure why LEGO doesn't do this with all their sets over a few hundred bricks.<br /><br />I don't play with these much - more for display than anything else, but I imagine this would hold up well to fairly rigorous play.<br /><br />Recommended for the LEGO Star Wars fan.
B002ZG997C|1.0|I could write a 10 page  NEGATIVE view about this film, however I already wasted 2 hours of my life, that I will never get back, watching this poor excuse for a film.  How does denzel has an Oscar????? His acting is mediocre at best. The movie actually had potential, but potential does not equal good.,., well I said enough about this horrible film. I do have to admit Gary Oldman gives a great performance! What was Albert Hughes thinking!!!???  Well, he wasn't!!

B005ANZN3G|5.0|I greatly enjoyed the Blu-ray of Lang Lang's Liszt concert. He is bringing something fresh and exciting to music. The speed of the camera shifts is certainly meant for a young audience,and together with the lighting and special effects...it has pop concert overtones with all the energy, technical skill and passion that Lang Lang brings to his performances. His Live In Vienna Blu-ray might better suit more traditional concert goers, but it is great to see Lang Lang's style connecting with new audiences.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|it would be an awesome app but it doesn't play movies well, it is choppy. and the sound doesn't match up with the movie but it would rock and be.worth the.five bucks if it ran well
B003O2RQKS|5.0|I first heard Lang Lang play in a recital - just pure piano and amazing artistry. I knew I was taking in something very special in my musical experience. He plays with immense technical skill, but also with heart and soul. I recommend the Live in Vienna Blu-ray as a great way to bring Lang Lang as a performer into your musical world.

B003UAMWWQ|4.0|\\"Spaceballs\\" is a very funny Star Wars spoof that is mostly just a vehicle to poke fun at Star Wars and a host of other popular pre-1990 movies. This is a great comedic cast, including Mel Brooks (President Skroob / Yogurt), John Candy (Barf), Rick Moranis (Dark Helmet), Bill Pullman (Lone Starr), Daphne Zuniga (Princess Vespa), Dick Van Patten (King Roland), George Wyner (Colonel Sandurz), and Joan Rivers (voice of Dot Matrix).<br /><br />This is not a very deep movie but it is a lot of fun and is very quotable, especially when watching original Star Wars movie. The movie is a little dated now and I had to explain some of more obscure movie references to my kids, but was still good to share it with them now that they are old enough.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

B0020PJJHS|4.0|\\"Goldeneye\\" stars Pierce Brosnan as \\"Bond, James Bond\\". It is absolutely worthy of being in the series of Bond flicks and it is one of my favorites.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The action starts right away and is well paced throughout the movie, punctuated with Bond's normal romantic dalliances, handy gadgets, and witty quips, as he races to to foil the plans of an evil mastermind. That is pretty much the plot of all Bond flicks, but it still works well in this one.<br /><br />The acting is above normal for a Bond movie, with good villains (for the most part), a solid \\"M\\", and new \\"Q\\". The special effects and stunts are also very good for the time the movie was made.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
1451627289|5.0|While I end up liking most of the books that I read by Stephen King, he isn't an author that I salivate over when something new comes out. I'm not sure why, as I like the genre and the style of writing. Perhaps I'll chalk it up to having too many other things to read. :)  Anyway, 11/22/63: A Novel caught my interest in terms of what it might be like to go back and prevent an event in history that changed the world. Once I started reading, I was pretty much hooked. King put a slant on the typical time travel story that threw my expectations out the window and had me thinking about the \\"what if\\" moments of life...<br /><br />The story revolves around Jake Epping, an ordinary teacher with an ordinary life... that is, until Al, the owner of the local diner, shows him something unexplainable. In the pantry, there is a \\"hole\\" that leads back to September 9th, 1958.  It's the same location at the same time with the same people every time they go through the passage. Furthermore, the exact same actions and events start happening when they arrive, and nobody there remembers that Jake or Al were ever there. If you think of the movie \\"Groundhog Day\\", you get the idea.  Regardless of how much time Jake or Al spend in the past, only two minutes elapse in current time.  Stay in the past for a year, come back, and it's only two minutes later.  Jake and Al have aged that one year, but nothing else has.<br /><br />Al shows all this to Jake for a reason... Al is dying of cancer, and he has a plan in mind. He wants Jake to cross back over to 1958 and live the next five years with a single purpose: to prevent Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating John F. Kennedy. He believes that many of the problems of today can be traced back to that pivotal event, and he wants to change history at that point in time. He leaves Jake a detailed notebook on Oswald's life and movements up to the point of the shooting, and Jake needs to make sure he doesn't do anything in that five year period to alter Oswald's life and erase the point in time where he can stop Kennedy's death.  But as Jake finds out, \\"the past is obdurate\\", and it will work at making sure that history plays out as intended with no interference.  And the bigger the historical change, the harder the past will work at preventing it.<br /><br />Normally, a time travel story seems to play out along the same lines. Person goes back in time, inadvertently does something to affect the future, and/or meets him/herself along the way.  You could argue that the basics of 11/22/63 are the same, in that a person is going back in time to change or prevent something. But the stakes are higher here, in that Jake has to decide whether or not to spend the next five years of his life pursuing something that may or may not happen if he makes mistakes along the way. He also has to right some wrongs and figure out how best to prevent certain people from acting. He could kill them early, but that might put him in jail with no way to return to the portal to get back to 2011. Or what if the conspiracy theories were true, and Oswald was set-up to take the fall? Killing Oswald wouldn't prevent Kennedy's death. What I found even more mind-bending was what happened when he tried to prevent an accident that put someone in a wheelchair back in 1958. He prevented a stray bullet from paralyzing a woman, and returned to 2011 to find that she had lived a very successful life as a fully-functional adult. But once he went back through the portal, everything from 1958 forward reset, and she was again in a wheelchair in 2011. Even though the person has no knowledge of how history changed for them, does that still make Jake responsible for returning her to a life of paralysis again?  And finally, can you be sure that regardless of how bad things may seem right now, changing a major event in history will really make things better 50 years later?<br /><br />King pulled off a great novel in 11/22/63. While I thought it was perhaps a bit slowat times when he was shadowing Oswald in the 18 or so months leading up to the assassination, the mental and moral quandaries more than made up for it. I really need to rethink my slowness in reading new King novels, as I'd be a happy reader if I always had material like this to read during my down times.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedn the 18 or so months leading up to the assassination, the mental and moral quandaries more than made up for it.

B002TVQ4GW|4.0|Christopher Smith is definitely a director to watch. TRIANGLE takes what could have been a tired premise and draws it out to (and beyond) its logical conclusion. Melissa George stars as a young mother who takes a boat trip with some friends. When the boat capsizes, they take shelter on a seemingly abandoned cruise ship, and soon discover they're not alone.  I thought I was ahead of the movie, successfully figuring out \\"the twist,\\" but wasn't prepared for what came after. Smith's film has a premise that demands certain things to be true, and he follows his own rule to the letter. By the end, he's executed the premise with impeccable conviction, letting the movie wrap and twist around itself far more than I would have guessed. It's remarkably effective. The final act is an extraordinary payoff, giving us a sisyphean tragedy that actually felt complete.  I've been recommending this to friends and they've all enjoyed it just as much as I did. A real surprise, and I think this movie deserves a lot of attention.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|One hundred years from now,  this show could be known as classical music as is any Bach, Mozart or any other fine musician. I'm 57, my Mom likes several cuts from this disc. Good guitar playing crosses over to anyone.
B00006AUIG|5.0|\\"Session 9\\" is a movie I hold very dear. It is a study of minimalism and dread. There's very little here to hold on to for hardcore horror fans (hence some of its negative reviews), but is a treasure for people who love smart, subtle, character-driven horror.  Few films have such an intense sense of place as is evoked by the Danvers Mental Institution that serves as the film's backdrop. The story is very simple: a group of contractors agree to remove hazardous materials from the condemned institution and spend a week within its walls. While there, paranoia and insanity begin to spread through the group, and a truly terrifying story of evil unfolds. Peter Mullan is amazing in the lead, setting the mold for the guilt-ridden protagonist that Brad Anderson will return to explore in THE MACHINIST, SOUNDS LIKE, and TRANSSIBERIAN.  Hardcore fans will find the film slow and accuse it of lacking payoff, particularly younger viewers or those with short attention spans. But discerning viewers will find so much to like about this movie, and find that the voice of \\"Simon\\" will become one of the most haunting and memorable things they've experienced in a horror film.  This is a master-class of mood and subtle horror. Cannot recommend it enough for people who prefer intelligence to T&A.
B004SBQALA|4.0|The first few scenes seem to be going in the direction of a teenage high school flick with the usual suspects appearing in their assigned roles. Fortunately the movie doesn't lose too much time before it shifts gear to more of a sci-fi adventure flick with some interesting twists and turns.<br /><br />As the movie progresses we get vicious alien invaders and space monsters, not to mention shape shifters and lovely alien heroines. All told this rather traditional mix results in an entertaining sci-fi adventure that held my attention all the way to the sort of end.<br /><br />I say sort of end because it definitely screams sequel to me; the story stops with no conclusive resolution to the main problem. If we don't see a sequel to this one it will only be because the receipts don't justify it; I suppose time will tell and I certainly wish them well.

I really enjoyed how Dave used real examples of his actual work to validate the social media principles he discusses. Also, at the end of each chapter Dave uses exercises for you to try with your business or organization. I look forward to putting the knowledge gained from this book into my own start-up later this year!

0143119680|1.0|Don't bother buying this book!  It has an adequate beginning, which goes on, and on, and on, and on....  There is no ending, just fodder for the next book.  It is poorly written.  A good editor would have culled more than half of the book.  So much of the book is irrelevant to anything.  I am completely disgusted that I actually bought this book!

B004M20YDU|5.0|I disagree with others who have reviewed this album, the best song on this album is M83's version of Fall. A brilliantly melodic piece, right down to the last few seconds fade out. As for the rest of the album, it's an outstanding piece of electronica worthy of Daft Punk. If you are into electronica, you will not be disappointed with this purchase.

B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I bought this to make wine bottle lights.  I have cut flat glass before, but never wine bottles, so I followed the instructions to the letter.  Hours later, I had one unevenly broken wine bottle and 5 others cut and unseparated...I was ready to drink a bottle of wine myself!  Here's how I altered the instructions and it happened to work for me.<br /><br />First, I laid the device on it's side, which helped me to get a smoother, much more even score.<br /><br />Next, I figured out that using the tapper gave me uneven separation...just put it back in the box.<br /><br />The directions state that you should alternately dunk the bottle in simmering and ice water - 5 seconds in each.  That didn't work at all for me.  I let the wine bottle sit in the boiling water for more like 30 seconds, and then ice water for 30 seconds.  In most cases, it only took one or two dunks for the bottles to separate.  Much more successful....and WAY less frustrating!<br /><br />Enjoy your projects!
0596009208|2.0|The authors of this book claim that they studied the way people learn, and wrote the book from that perspective. Maybe they studied how people with ADHD learn, but I can't tolerate the torrent of distracting gimmicks. I ended up taking a community college course instead that was actually effective.
B006UG909U|5.0|The album gets BETTER every time you listen to it! The songs turn into characters that are alive and writhing in your speakers, you get to know and enjoy them more each time you listen. Dave, Ed, Alex, and Wolfie are amazing and tight, tight, tight!
B0001AP13A|2.0|I was really excited to get this on vinyl as it is such a great album, unfortunately as soon as you drop the needle you can tell the vinyl quality is terrible. There are so many bumps in the record itself it literally makes it unlistenable. I don't know how people get away with selling terrible quality records, but it happens, if you really want this album it would be better buying it on cd.
B000BQV52A|5.0|I listened to samples of several pianists playing these pieces and instantly approved of Gulda.  I do not know if he is the definitive performer of these works, or if there is one.  I agree with another reviewer as to not like Glen Gould on Beethoven though.  That man is suited to Bach...I digress.  As to other musicians, I will not go into them one by one, but each had some quality that rubbed me wrong instantly. Just a feeling.  Or the set of their works was too pricey comparatively.  This set is a bargain for 12 CDs and I feel the best deal around (though price just went up- should we all stop praising it?).  You may want other sets of the same works if you are an avid collector, but you will not need any others.  I have a second edition of a few of the works.  These works are uniformly good, but with standouts.  That is, there are no bad sonatas but there are several great ones.  You get two versions of the glorious \\"Appasionista\\", Number 23.  The sound quality is superb.  The playing is level, emotional, intelligent, beautiful, steady.  Any good term you can name.  If you find a better collection, then I think the difference would be slight.  All you need with Beethoven really is a well trained monkey though, let's be honest.  Which is perhaps why I dislike Gould.  With Bach there is room to make the thing one's own, but with Beethoven and his themes- the work is done.  It is magnificent, colossal, stupendous, awe-inspiring, shocking, perfect.  He has put so much thought and movement into the music there is only room to play it.  Right on the paper he was composer, conductor, and orchestra.  Just follow directions.  But that is a layman's interpretation.  The highlight of this set you will probably not have heard before: The 4th and 5th concertos on the 12th disc, which is a whopping 76 minutes and 6 movements of grand finale!  To career, life: when I listen to it, I feel like I am hearing Beethoven's autobiography: triumph, surprise, beauty, let down, contemplation.  I do not believe any human being could create something so grand, so elegant, and almost painfully rich and full and inspired again. Something can be as good, but no better.  But these may be new to you as they are long and without standout section; just uniformly steady.  With the Moonlight Sonata, you know the first movement, and the only surprise is there has been a 2nd and 3rd all along for hundreds of years.  With the 5th Concerto, at the end I am exhausted, I think I could never listen to it again, and that I have to start it again.  Added plus, the box takes little shelf space as it contains sleeves for the discs.  My only wish is that the pictures on each sleeve showed Beethoven again and his hair getting crazier, but just note how long these reviews all are- there is no way to say a little about this set.  If you are undecided, get this one.
B006W0QOF2|4.0|...not in that this was a perfect movie, just in that the movie seems to be likely exactly what was intended.  The movie is jarring, and the main character's combination of detachment and morality is surely intended to take the experience to even more disorienting levels.  Gosling's character is the manifestation of a stunt driver: nameless, generally mute, surrounded by (and comfortable in) chaos.  Really well done, definitely worth seeing, and absolutely atypical.  This is a movie that trades the warm comfort of predicability--at a very fundamental level--in order to provide a refreshing experience.
B006UG90RM|5.0|this is a great van halen record, a very welcome return with david lee roth.  It took long enough, but the fans of the roth years finally got their record.  My 2 cents, this may not have the impact single of \\"ain't talkin about love\\", \\"unchained\\" or \\"everybody wants some\\" but there is not a bad song in the bunch and most are very exceptional, and if you add it up, that's 13 great songs, many more than on an average roth vh album.  my personal favorites on this album are \\"outta space\\", \\"honey baby sweetie doll\\" and \\"as is\\", but all the rest are right up there.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|I wish i would have never watched this movie, hard to follow, very abstract, does not hold your interest at all. it would serve better as a screensaver on your desktop.
0307352145|5.0|I have read hundreds of books that I \\"recommend\\" and one or two that I share often but can't recall a business book so profound in its' importance. In my many speaking sessions on the mechanics of networking I have found in the 50+ books I've read on the topic that \\"introverts to it better\\" but I have never been able to prove it. Until now.<br /><br />The author's use of neuroscience and FMRI's to understand the brain and how humans are built is nothing new to my library of \\"the mechanics of networking\\" - but this author traveled the globe got her hands dirtier than any business author I've ever read and what makes the truth of this book so valuable.<br /><br />How does anyone attack a horde army - you kill the King.<br /><br />Yes. Tony Robbins.<br /><br />The author doesn't read his books and snipe from the comfort of her home office no this introvert went to his $1000 session and scientifically dissected decades of business rantings from Tony and the armada he and his ilk have built.<br /><br />But she doesn't stop there. No, it's on to Mordor. Yes, Harvard U.<br /><br />On campus at Harvard she takes an objective eye to the way society has embraced the extrovert ideal and how one of the world's leading institutions has become it's cheerleader and chief marketing machine.<br /><br />Examples of powerful influencers like the surprising story of Dale Carnegie, Gandhi, Theodore Geisel ( Dr. Suess \\"In mass, children terrify me\\" ) and an indepth example of Eleanor Rosevelt that will inspire thousands more to embrace their personal power as thinkers who can do instead of doers who can think.<br /><br />There is plenty of science, the value of which will help both introverts and extroverts who read the book. How to optimize your work, home and relationships - powerful stuff. It will help introverts who work in the professions of designation ( lawyers, accountants ) and are forced to network understand themselves better, and how to still be effective. To know that coming back from an enforced \\"holiday\\" event having had just two meaningful business conversations is actually equal to the extrovert who powers through the room like a bee in a field of flowers, coming home with a stack of cards they will do nothing with and only follow up with two people anyway - Introverts don't know their power. This book is a call to arms.<br /><br />Although any extrovert who reads this book will find themselves outright despising the author ( I'm a 70 - 30 extrovert split so there was a little gnashing of teeth ) her attendance at a class for professionals from Asia on how to understand North American extroverts is beyond eye opening, you will consider that if you don't change you will walk through life with the largest populations on earth thinking you are a fool.<br /><br />Again, it feels like the author is taking the easy path in showing how extroverts were the cause of the great crash of 2008. But we have to learn from these  events and there is no doubt her points are well researched and very valid, you'll find yourself shaking your head, knowing she's right.<br /><br />One item I found has a huge business application is the myth of \\"collaborative office space\\".  I think cubicles are a business necessity, and I respect that - but I have this thing about claiming open concept offices allow more creativity. The author goes into detail about this, any manager or CEO who gives a damn about productivity will read this to increase revenue ( because I know how you really feel about \\"treating your people well\\" ). That being said, I couldn't explain when I walked into the \\"Centre For Social Innovation\\" in Toronto that it felt so right, and the book explains how to do it right and now I know why it feels so right. Want to know? Buy the book.<br /><br />What I highly respect is that the book ends up with a lot of practical discussions and tools on how to adjust our business life, help our schools, children even our spouses to consider the issues of sensitivity, introvert-needs and issues.<br /><br />Sure there are so many places in the book I feel the author digging a little big, against no doubt the decades of tyranny of extroverts. Any extrovert who can get past this will find so much value in business, life and yes love.<br /><br />Within the first week, this book instantly hit the New York times best seller list, was featured on TV, radio and in print around the business world.<br /><br />I think it will become the \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" for what I call the thinking class.against no doubt the decades of tyranny of extroverts.

B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|I was recommended this book by my father in law who told me I would enjoy it. He wasn't wrong. It was a very well written and coherent piece of work which was not only interesting but also very informative. Its characters were well thought out and well rounded. The plot of the book was innovative and gradually led up to many twists and turns in the story which eventually equated to a brillant climax to the story. However, I did not aware the book five stars because some of the twists and turns in the story could be guessed well before they occured whihc spoiled some of the enjoyment of the book. Other then this quibble, I would not hesistate recommending this book to anybody who would like to read a gritty, and comaplex thriller.

If you were/are a fan of the Planet of the Apes movies, you will not be disappointed with this one.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|** spoiler alert **<br />After finishing this book yesterday, I am still fuming. I feel cheated by the ending. Why is it that authors of series, good series, tend not to know when to end the book? Look at JK Rowlins, she could have left the Epilogue off and everyone would have been just fine without it. Suzanne Collins, well, she could have ended it with Katniss going ape crazy bonkers nuts and I'd have been happy. But no. She chose to continue on with it and weave it into a \\"happily ever after\\" ending. Bah humbug!<br /><br />As far as Gale is concerned, still useless despite his role in the last book. Add him into the mix as a soldier, that's fine. But have him a \\"love interest\\" to just \\"make him disappear\\" at the end? psha!<br /><br />As for the predictability, yes, it still happened. I knew who Katniss was going to kill from the time she showed up in District 13. Katniss doesn't know how to be anything but someone else's pawn. The grass isn't always greener, is it?!<br /><br />The overall story was lovable. The first two books were really good, despite how I feel about the predictability and the love triangle. The third book was good, even. Up until she killed off Fennick and Prim, Gale disappearing (some love interest), and continued on to make it a semi happy ending. Ugh!<br /><br />But, I sure was hoping that Ms. Collins would have utilized the berries for her ending. Somehow gone back to the \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" aspect of it and ending it on that note. Or maybe make President Coin and President Snow husband and wife and this whole thing would have been a domestic dispute. Or nuke it all! Or even, having Katniss spend out the rest of her life in her insane little world, one in which she cannot remove herself from the Games, and everything she sees, and does, and thinks is just another part of the Games. It would have been a more interesting ending.<br /><br />I guess you can say, I didn't see this ending coming! And the only time I think I may have shed a tear was when she was back home in District 12 and Buttercup finally accepted her. Yeah, I love how cat's just know when you need some lovin'. :)<br /><br />\\"happily ever after\\"...such a cop out! Like \\"it was all a dream\\" cop out. CHEATED I TELL YA!finally accepted her. Yeah, I love how cat's just know when you need some lovin'. :)  \\"happily ever after\\"...such a cop out! Like \\"it was all a dream\\" cop out. CHEATED I TELL YA!
B0070Z97LG|3.0|A suspense/thriller movie with a different twist than the others. Did it deliver?  Yep!  You are completely drawn into this movie.<br /><br />It is not so much scary as it is suspenseful, it is not about anything \\"supernatural\\" like monsters or demons or such, and it is not likely to give you night terrors.<br /><br />I hate to say anything about the story - I think the less you know before watching, the better the movie is going to be for you.<br /><br />It IS a pretty good story though, good acting as well.  A little different with it's twists.  There is a good ending.  It's worth a watch.  I give it a 3.5/5 stars<br /><br />(And Rachael Weisz never looked so beautiful in a movie as she does here.)
B003TJR2HS|1.0|I ordered this to work with an iPhone 4s, Otter Box Defender Series Case and a Bose SoundDock Series II.  It fits the case okay but that's all.  It does not play any music through the SoundDock.  The phone and SoundDock play fine when the OtterBox is off and they are connected directly but the CableJive docStubz does not work at all. It is kind of flimsy and when it connects between the phone and the SoundDock, the weight of the phone seems to pull the phone and docStubz on an angle back toward the SoundDock.  In any case, it doesn't work.  I'm sending it back.

B005I6EVUG|2.0|Okay I know this received great reviews from everyone else but I hated it so much I bought a lightweight microshell by Marware (love) for my kidle fire. It's similar to the covers of the 1st and 2nd generation kindles and the kindle is secured inside by elastic. It's larger than the shells or the kindle fire, it's a cover, not a shell, so the kindle is bulkier in my purse (boo!) and has no elastic to keep the cover shut (another boo!). Finally, the red leather well, smells. Partially like leather, partially like chemical treatment. I'm paranoid the red will bleed on things if something happens. On the plus side, there is a pocket on the inside and the design is super cute with cities on the leather. I didn't return it-it might be useful for my older kindle-but I wouldn't buy it again.

B0007939NO|5.0|The movie is wonderful, great musical. The cast is wrong in the description, No ann miller, No debbie renolds, and no Donald O'connor. But the film does not suffer! Classic Gene Kelley/Cyd Charisse, Movie Good music, beautiful dancing. Quick plot limited twist and turn. The enjoyment is about the music and the dance. This is a classic Ninteen Fifty's feel good musical, if you do not want simple disneyish movie, don't buy this movie, If your a guy this is a chick flick, but The hour and and a half you think would not be lost on the your girl and you would not suffer looking at cyd charisse, or picking up a move from Gene Kelley. But for me I remember my grandmother pulling me into her lap watching movies like these. Make mememories as I do give to my grandchildren, hopefully, you will see! The world is fully of harsh reality, it's good to step back with this movie with enjoy family an friends, with out sosial media. Simply step back and enjoy the show, gamer need not apply.

B0034G4ORM|5.0|\\"Battle:Los Angeles\\" starts with the alien invaders, then takes you back 24 hours where you actually get to know the Marines, especially retiring Staff Sergeant Nantz. This was the best acting of Aaron Eckhart's career. Bridget Moynihan played the vet's part so well, and actually had one of the best lines in the movie, when Eckhart's character sustained minor wounds, \\"[I] only treat animals and aliens.\\" Then she asked what, \\"Retreat?Hell!\\" came from, and Eckhart told her the story behind the REAL MARINES who the actors played. They didn't show them getting together at the end, just a report the civilians were safe. However I could imagine nothing less than Eckhart and Moynihan (when the war was over and the aliens gone), taking her niece, her nephew, the orphaned boy, and getting married. This movie took you into an actual combat zone. People died. The platoon Nantz ended up commanding because the officer, with his wife pregnant, died. \\"Independence Day\\" didn't even come close to this movie in terms of war. You were divorced from the fact the President's wife died, and the only thing you felt good about was the firing of the wimp Secretary of Defense. Michelle Rodriguez actually pulled off her role as an Air Force Intelligent tech Sergent, adding a dimension needed without overpowering the rest of the troops. Eckhart and Monyihan nailed their roles. I love sci-fi, but that wasn't the issue: they provided an enemy that you didn't mind being blown to hell. The focus was on the Marines! I loved this movie more than \\"Black Hawk Down\\" -- where the only two characters that I had any interest in were Ewan MacGregor and Eric Bana. The rest of the cast of \\"Black Hawk Down\\" was nominal. I felt like I didn't know any of them except MacGregor and Bana, and even then I felt in this movie that I knew the characters, every one. The officer that dies, leaving his wife to raise their child alone. I felt for the solider with PTSD, who wasn't cleared for duty, except the aliens showedup. He switched immediately into \\"war mode\\" and did everything right, including sacrificing himself near the end of the movie. I \\"felt\\" it; his sacrifice would have earned him the \\"Medal of Honor\\", no doubt. Afterwards, my husband and I had a discussion about what medals and commendations they would earn as individuals who put themselves aside for the sake of their unit. Give Bridget Moynihan her due; she might not have had as much screen time, but when she did she nailed it. This movie is better than \\"Avatar\\", and that's saying a lot.

B0064Y5U24|5.0|There's no other band quite like Nickelback. Very few bands can release consistantly great albums and have such a variety of songs. Here and now is Nickelbacks 7th album and let me say this, it might be their best one yet. Here are my opinions on all of the tracks.  This means War: A great combination of heavy guitar riffs and agggressive vocals with lyrics such as \\"You've gone too far!, who you think your ARE!!!, Is this what your came for?!!! WELL THIS MEANS WAR!!!! . If your looking for something very aggressive but not quite heavy metal, than This means War is perfect. 5/5  Bottoms Up: This is one of the best tracks on the album. It's all about drinking and partying. There's something about this song that just demands you too keep pressing repeat, Great song.  When We Stand Together: A very deep meaning song that says we really whould stand together in these tough economic times.  Midnight Queen: If you're thinking this song has inuendos in it you're wrong. This song is all about sex, no inuendos what so ever with lyrics such as, \\" She's gonna lick my pistol clean\\", She's gonna be my sex machine and I'm like a pony in my own rodeo\\". It's still a great song with some nice guitar riffs.  Gotta Get Me Some: A very get down and groovy song. This track is upbeat with some cools guitar and moderately aggressive lyrics.  Lullaby: A song to people that are feeling copletely out of hope,too let them know that there's always someone who wants to help you. This song has a unique feel that Nickelback has never done before. It's very slow placed with some nice piano parts to it.  Kiss It Goodbye: Simply put, great song. It's all about drugs with lines such as: East coast digs the cocaine, west coast marijuana.\\"  Trying not to Love You: A great song about how trying not to love his girl only makes him love her more. A nice slow paced song.  Holding Onto Heaven: A very good love song about how holding onto you is like holding onto heaven.  Everyithing I wanna Do: Another songabout sexual themes, with lines such as \\" She'll do any naughty thing I want and Bout to take it up a notch, so watch what I'm about to do.\\"  Don't ever let it End: A nice slow paced piece related to friendship. Nothing really special about this song but it is very deep meaning.  In closing Nickelback's new album is simply flawless. I only dislike one song on the albums and that's Holding onto Heaven. Other than that this album is amazing.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|I adored this movie. Great acting, great plot, great dialogue, good twists, and while there are claims which can not be proven it was overall quite historically accurate.
B005L7B22C|5.0|at this time i would like to say that i am crushing like crazy on Captain Jack Harkness. i have NOT yet seen Miracle Day (it is due out on dvd tomorrow--FINGERS CROSSED!!!), but i am truly sad that the TINY MINDS of the world might let Torchwood die, without closure. i PRAY (c'mon, pray with me.) that the 50th Anniversary Doctor Who season will include Jack--it really should.  John Barrowman plays Jack, and is a really lovely person--i hope nothing but happiness, for him, and everyone he loves.

B0000025D0|5.0|I heard Darkness track on the radio and immediately bought the album. I put this on the turntable a few months ago and it still touches me with it's mournful poetic lyrics. 1978 Was a sad time, separated and single with an 18 month old daughter, I was in a grieving period for my x. My child meant everything to me and in the evening when she was asleep I would play the album. Alone in that cold winter, late at night, this album spoke to me and helped me through a rough year.  She is grown, successful and has her own babies now and we are very close. But it seems like yesterday when I listen to this album. Thanks Bruce.
0439023513|2.0|I should really learn to listen to that little inner voice, the one that screams at me telling me I'm being stupid when I accept reading recommendations from other people, or at least ones without a good track record at suggesting books that I'll actually like. A special pox on those who recommend the first book of a series ...  But anyway.  I was trying to pacify a friend's teenage daughter by acquiescing to her claims of the awesomeness of the Hunger Games.  That's it. That's my only excuse. For the first one. Which wasn't bad. It was interesting, a different take on The Running Man, but with kids, and a strong government is evil subplot. Fine. I read it.  Then I figured out that Catching Fire was very much of a bridge book. It only existed to drag the reader from point A to point B.  So here we are. Mockingjay. The culmination of what now passes for an epic storyline, and clearly isn't.  Think Running Man meets Twilight, but with more gunfire and explosions.  I like gunfire and explosions, but not these.  I saw the ending from the beginning, which is never a good thing.  Oh, and everybody sparkles in the pretty, sunsoaked meadow at the end.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|This was my first Jack Reacher/Lee Child novel.  Friends had recommended the series.  Then I saw the author on a Charlie Rose interview and was impressed.  I figured this was a good place to start since it is a retrospective that explains why Reacher left the Army.  I was not disappointed.  The book reads very well and unfolds an interesting and complex story in an exciting narrative.  Multiple murders in a remote Mississippi town adjacent to an Army Ranger base.  Several suspects, considerable intrigue...great reading.  Plus it enlightens the reader on Jack Reacher's background.  My only real complaint (and this is a small one) was that Lee Child does not seem to understand U.S. geography very well.  He somehow seems to place Memphis about six or seven hours from Washington, D.C.  Reacher makes the trip several times and none of them made sense to me.  But if that is all I can find to complain about.....  Overall, I really enjoyed this book.  It is one of the best crime novels I have read.  I am now anxious to try some more Reacher/Child novels.
0439023521|5.0|Well written fast read. The book kept me rivited while I follwed the story. I was quickly sucked into the story of Katniss and routed for her to win until the very end.
B0070Z4M4I|2.0|*Warning* This review is spoiler-tastic<br /><br />If you completely ignore the existance of John Carpenter's The Thing than this movie would probably be seen in a better light, but alas it's in the shadow of it's 80's predecessar. Since around 2004 a few writers considered another film to add to the Thing's series, ultimately settling on a prequel. They took a long time to write the script, and gave it to the Strike company who produced Dawn of the Dead, so things (LOL PUN!) looked pretty bright huh? Then the director said while there was a woman as the star, there would be no ham-fisted love story and the effects will be practical, and the cast will be largely Norwegian, staying true to the original. Wow! Hopes were high for this, well lets take all of these promising features and apply them to the finished product.<br /><br />-Prequel: it made sense to make it a prequel, there was some room for a sequel to the Thing but it could've gone horribly wrong since everyone in the original is presumed dead. Could've been really really stupid so they played it safe, and although the end is predictable the journey there can be entertaining.<br /><br />-Strike Company: this is where the problems come in, while the prequel seemed like it was getting loving care and detail to polish it up Strike decided to rush the production, meaning all the effects turned into CGI, which was lazy and stupid. The story itself is also rushed, aside from Kate, the white American pilot and the jerk boss Sanders we don't know anything about any of the other characters, and they're all hard to distinguish from each other which is a real shame because they all look like good actors.<br /><br />-Norwegians: The original script called for an all Norwegian cast, as it was a Norwegian camp, makes sense right? But the production company wanted more 'MURICANS so the stupid xenophobic audience can relate, so the half of the cast that matters are Americans, while all the Norwegians are treated like death fodder, being largely inconsequential to the plot. Oh and the one single Norwegian that doesn't know English happens to be the one that confronts the Americans in Carpenter's version. Veeeeery coincedential.<br /><br />-Starring a Female!: Sigorney Weaver has shown that a woman can kick ass in these kinds of films, but there shouldn't be some corny Grrl Power message thrown in. There was in here. Throughout the film you see that Sanders and Kate have a slowly building rivalry, and at some point in the film he talks with the other Norwegian superior literally saying \\"looks like the woman is in charge now\\". Do we really need this in sci-fi horror movie the Thing? We're not watching Sex & the City here, and of course at the end Kate has a dumb showdown with the monster who happens to have Sander's face still intact, in case the dumb audience couldn't put it together that this guy is mean to women and should die, even though, he already did... stupid decision.<br /><br />Weird Unnecessary Set Up Scenes: So apparently there was a dog in the camp somewhere, you see like one second where it's trying to bite open the cage. Ok? It's just out of the camera until the very end, who knows what it was doing the whole time, who got to it, why they wanted the dog, whatever. It pops up at the end anyways which brings me to another scene. Kate and the one Norwegian that doesn't speak English (Lars) go to a grenade cache in a fairly suspenseful scene, but then he just opens it up and stares at her and grunts \\"granada\\". If I were Kate I would be like \\"Ok. What about the grenades? Any plan with them? Are you going to start chucking grenades at whoever turns into the next thing in these tight confined rooms? Couldn't grenades destroy most of the building, messing up the whole warm shelter situation we have going for us? Why grenades? Aren't flamethrowers doing the job already? What? Who? Why?\\" Grenades serve no practical purpose for them until the very ending, he just shows it to her andmight as well wink at the audience, saying \\"we know this a prequel, see?\\".<br /><br />-The Trailer: The trailer gave away everyone who was the Thing in one way or another, and even if you didn't see the trailer the film itself makes it painfully clear who's the Thing. One of the great things about the original is that whenever someone turned out to be the Thing it was completely unexpected, they were completely off the list of red herrings and the film doesn't exactly show when they were assimilated. In the prequel however one guy leaves the group when the Thing escapes, guess what happened to him? Later we see that guy just stare at someone as THEY leave the group, guess what happens to that person! Edvard genuinely suprised me though, but that brings me to my next point.<br /><br />-The Thing itself: despite it being crappy CGI effects the Thing itself acted stupidly, I guess you could say it was getting used to people so it was more prone to mistakes, but that sounds like a sloppy excuse considering this Thing likely wiped out planets in order to get all those grotesque shapes. In this prequel however when the Thing attacks people it's very loud and makes a huge commotion, like when the French chick turned into the Thing it started throwing bookcases over and roaring really loudly, also breaking the door open to chase Kate down a hallway. Can you imagine if it happened to catch her and assimilate her, both of them later explaining that to the others? \\"Uhh we were kind of play fighting and one of us hit the door so hard it broke off, yeah that's it, keep looking at that broken door with your back turned as we roar into giant things and make even more commotion\\". Also the Thing in Carpenter's wasn't a good brawler, it's strength was stealth, it attacked one person at a time and when it was confronted by multiple people it wasn't very effective, it tried hiding and running away. In this new one when Edvard changes he kills like 6 people under a minute, the worst addition being that lame spear tentacle that stabs a few people. Wow, really interesting death scene, *yawn* oh is it over already?<br /><br />Third act: After the camp is decimated and the two attractive American's are chasing the evil sexist foreigner the film reaches what could be the dumbest scene of all time, the space ship scene. Basically it's an excuse for Kate to get stuck in narrow spaces and for loud CGI jump scares, until we get to the famous gender showdown at the end, where she blows it up similar to the ending to Carpenter's the Thing. Here's an alternate idea for that whole third act, the spaceship crashed, the alien LEFT the spaceship so it's obviously NOT working, instead of going back it makes a break for another camp and the tractor runs out of gas so it starts going on foot. The American's catch up but are low on flamethrower gas, so they have to sacrifice the gas to get them back in order to destroy the Thing once and for all. This would lead to an ambigious ending, instead of Kate going to some Russian camp after burning the stupidest Thing ever that didn't kill her when it had the chance.<br /><br />But it had some good aspects too, the cinematography was beautiful, and I thought the cold climate was shown effectively. The Thing designs were still grisly and memorable, also some of the deaths were pretty nasty (like the hand-thing glued to that guys face, F THAT). Despite the predictability of who was who there was still some tension in the 2nd act between all of the characters, and they played off each other really well. And of course the ending was a perfect bridge between Carpenter's version and the prequel. Overall I found it disappointing though because it was obviously rushed out and dumbed down for mass appeal.<br />When the Thing came out in the 80's someone summed up it's production process perfectly, saying \\"it was a movie that could only come out in the 80's\\", meaning the studios were more lax about what was going on, the deadlines weren't rushed, they had time to make some really good practical effects, and so on and so forth. It was a product of it's time, similar to the first couple of Star Wars, the prequel to the Thing however is also a product of the current time, the Thing's now owned by Universal and they made it as appealing as they could, sacrificing geniune surpises, fleshed out characters, and a really solid script for a quick appealing film. If Carpenter's film released in 2011 it would probably be like this, CGI fest with a rushed script. I would however recommend this to anyone interested, especially if they haven't seen the 80's version. It's still a pretty interesting story, but if you've seen the Carpenter version and how tight that script was this one comes off as weak and disappointing.dition being that lame spear tentacle that stabs a few people.

B00000DFRS|4.0|During the mid 1990's Whitney Houston settled into what turned out to be a turbulent marriage with Bobby Brown. They had a daughter and...she wound up becoming somewhat like Elvis in one regard. She stopped making music save for the occasional theme to the films she was staring in. Although they were both very successful ventures. After several years as a mother,actress and a wife with the beginnings of a &#34;habit&#34; if you get my drift Whitney decided in 1998 to make her first studio album in nearly a decade. As aware of she was of the changes in musical climate when she made [[ASIN:B000002VH6 I'm Your Baby Tonight]] eight years earlier,things were even harder to keep track of. At that time,featuring contemporary producers and guest singers/rappers was a good careerist move. By the late 90's,it was expected and almost mandatory sometimes. So Whitney,on this one her debut at self production-with songwriting by Rodney Jerkins,Dianne Warren Wyclef Jean along with Babyface and herself she also gathered up a list of female soul singers/artists who'd filled the void she left in the mid 90's such as Faith Evans and Missy Elliot. Now non of these people seem at first to mesh well with Houston's urbane approach. Again,the results are often surprising.<br /><br />  While this music is occasionally bound by the two-step dance style hip/hop/R&B production cliche Jerkins seemed to get on almost all his productions,this actually continues Whitney's transition towards a thicker soul/R&B sound. Only this time the groove takes a heavier presidents. &#34;Get It Back&#34; and a re-write of Stevie Wonder's hit entitled &#34;I Was Made To Love Him&#34; are the first time I've heard Whitney Houston do anything that was out and out funk,rather than a polished variation of it. These songs are pretty in your face rhythmically. &#34;Heartbreak Hotel&#34; is the big hit here featuring Faith and Kelly Price for a very stereotypical late 90's hip-hop/R&B song. Good and pretty funk. But a style done by so many the exact same way,at the same time. She also applies this approach to ballads as well. Gone completely are the &#34;super model big ballad&#34; type songs and you either get big Hollywood epic style songs such as &#34;When You Believe&#34; with Mariah Carey from [[ASIN:0525460500 Prince of Egypt]] or more stirring soul/gospel affairs such as &#34;I Learned From The Best&#34;,&#34;Until You Come Back&#34; and &#34;You'll Never Stand Alone&#34;. There's also some other happy surprises in the title track,featuring kind of a relaxed slow proto reggae/hip-hop groove and &#34;If I Told You That&#34;,my favorite song here anticipating her future interest in retro 70's Philly style sophistifunk,only more stripped down.<br /><br />  I'm not sure if it was all the time away from the scene or the experiences she had with Bobby Brown. But the years from 1992 to 1998 had changed something in Whitney. She still possessed the drive and determination that had defined her approach to music and lyrical content. But she was also alot more hardened and worldly for the ware. There are references throughout this album of things she feels she has to give up to survive. And the fact she really went more for groove in the funk/hip-hop styled vein here really captures that new spirit she has. Whitney had become a certified soul/R&B/funk artist now,with a strong urban and hip-hop edge to her music. Something of an outsider passing through the world of the urban diva. And making it with that all important credibility. None of the music here sets her into a place where she seems to have some honorary pop crossover pass that gives the impression that soul music would seem like &#34;slumming&#34; to her. Now it's who she is. She always was. And it's presented as glorious thing for her,not as something &#34;nice&#34; people would'nt listen to. It was just cleverly kept at arms length from much of her audience. Lucky,for those who always knew what a soulstress she was,this along with the previous album removed any doubt she could survive be adapting basically to herself.album removed any doubt she could survive be adapting basically to herself.

014118213X|1.0|I had to both read the novel and watch the movie for a college course. This book (and by extension, movie) is (are) incredibly dull.  I was absolute torture to read this book, and watch the two and a half hour movie. The only interesting part was when Charles Wilcox killed Leonard Bast, but there wasn't even a cool fight scene, and no blood.  Even after reading and watching, none of the characters are in any way exciting, and the plot is not memorable.  Sorry if you're a fan, but I feel I have wasted far too much of my life with this book. If there were a button I could press to obliterate every memory I have of it, I would press it.  If you'd like to be excruciatingly bored, then I'd highly recommend this book, and the film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game for kids and aduilts. most kids wonder apps to buy but this is the one app to buy 101 in one for free.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I will begin my review by stating, they could have released anything and I would have bought it as a lifelong Van Halen fan.  With that said, I was cautiously optimistic about this release.  Could it possibly live up to my expectations and hopes?  And how would it fair against the earlier catalog, they couldn't release something 28 years after their last DLR-led release that could stand proudly with their earlier releases could they?  Well the answer is YES!!!  Now for me, NOTHING truly stands with the first few Van Halen releases as they are music perfection for me but this cd is SOOO amazing that it even blew me away.  The more I listen, the more I like it and the more the memorable hooks stick in my mind.  I gave this 5 stars only because 6 was NOT available.  This is an EPIC CD release that ANY fan of their earlier music will absolutely LOVE!!!  The Boyz are back baby!!!!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus is and isn't about a circus. It is more about magic than anything else. It is a wondrous tale of a magical competition and an impossible love story.<br />  I didn't really know if this was a book that I would want to read or not. I had seen it several times, but had no idea what it was really about and I only read it for my book group. That being said, this book is excellent. It is very different than most books that I read so it was a nice change of pace.<br />  The story line and writing are unique and intriguing and leave so much to the imagination. I found the beginning to be a bit slow and vague, but it quickly picked up. The story is written in a way that reminded me of the movie Memento. It did take a minute to get used to, but once you start following the dates it all makes sense. There were many times when I wondered what something had to do with the story, but it all makes sense eventually.<br />  The characters in this story are all unique and great. My favorites were the main characters, Marco and Celia. All of the supporting characters are great and each add a special touch to the story making them all essential.<br />  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I highly recommend it to everyone.

B004P4S4NM|4.0|Let's just put it this way...  First CD/album I've bought and/or downloaded by someone younger than me in God knows how long.  Part country, part blues, part rock 'n pop.  Adele does it all.  Saw her on the TV news magazine \\"60 Minutes\\" & fell in love with her style.  Remember...I grew up with the likes of Elvis, The Beatles & so many great MoTown stars.  And this gal impresses me...a LOT!  How's that?

B000VDUWMC|3.0|This book was all it's cracked up to be... however as others have pointed it out it's very annoying not to have the tables and charts included in the Kindle version. Some of the early ones were included, but the later (and more crucial) ones were not. Super annoying!

B004M6UCI8|5.0|This collection is something you will keep in your collection forever.  Even though the reviews said it was ll discs, I could hardly believe it.  Any one of the discs would be worth the price.  This collection has some of the best music ever written, by one of the best flutists alive today.  It is hard to get through all the discs, simply because each one is so good, I kept listening to it over and over!  Fantastic!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's Star Wars and it has the best sound and video of any of the many re-releases. Get over any small gripes. Some changes are for the best and some aren't but none wreck or make the movie.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A lot like the old missle command.  Playing in Dr,s office.  Everyone else looks bored,I look like a kid with a new toy.  Get it, lots of fun.
B004I1AGTM|2.0|If it were just the usual martial arts movie, the type with the hot choreographed kung fu kick ... scenes and zero story line, than this movie would have been just fine.  However, since this is a sequel, a sequel to the great IP MAN, well than you should expect to get flamed for delivering such a pathetic attempt.  I can't imagine anyone giving this more than 3 stars especially after seeing the original IP MAN.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|like games, its for free so meets expectations gets me guru breastfeedibg and long toilet breaks. favorite game is the yarn one
B006O5XYWG|5.0|I really like how everything fit everything together. I thought I was going to have a problem with apes taking over b/c with our tech levels there is no way they would be a threat. I liked the plot twist. All in all a good movie very enjoyable.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|The lead character is slick as oil, shucking and jiving with his criminal clients, playing fast and loose to make a quick buck.  The main story arc has its overall predictability but the movie manages to lead you down the garden path and then change up what you think is coming next.  Not totally unpredictable, but the cliches are mostly avoided...a rare thing in legal beagle films.  The characters are interesting and realistic enough to really tick you off!  I enjoyed the greasy-weasel-with-a-conscious lead character.  Matthew McConaughey is strong.  Marisa Tomei's character is generally fluff and unnecessary.  William H. Macy is great as the weaselly lawyer's P.I.  Plenty of twists to keep you off balance.  I give it a thumbs up.<br /><br />The one problem I had with the movie is that the lead character starts out really fast and loose with the morals, then suddenly gets morals.  It was a fairly wide character swing, but he comes back to a place that fits with the initial character by the end.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised. A good solid underdog movie. Not Shakespeare but not full of holes either.  The bad choices the father made even do seem real. Gamblers always want it all at once instead of taking it slowly. Had He just practiced with Noisy Boy and taken it slow he would have been just fine. I was worried they were going to turn the Bot into something sentient, but in the end they left it a father son story. Good call.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Loved the first season but put off buying the second, as I feared it ended on a cliff-hanger. After reading some encouraging reviews I purchased it, and I am glad I did. The ending is well worth the build up of the many plot lines/story arcs throughout the season, even those carried over from the first. Great acting, amazing effects for so small a budget, gorgeous locations, and beautiful women swinging weapons around! What's not to love about this show! I heartily recommend for lovers of LOTR, Hercules/Xena, and Sam Raimi's other works.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Most movies use too much embarrassment humor. This one did not. Seemed closer to real life.  A very solid movie I expected a c+ at best and got an A.
B005T87QCI|5.0|oh ya this game is cool but I wish they could put in atom and sues it has very good graphics
B0073PZIYI|2.0|Even in today's time you can put limits on a card on how much can be spent in day. You would have Per Diems like the agent had.  The movie had several good ideas the middle started to let me down and the end just got silly. All in all a let down.  SPOILER******  Do you really think 2 people could rob something that stores so much time with out any planning as a smash and grab? I mean the ending if 2 people could walk into a reserve with guns that society would have collapsed to lawlessness and guns rule a long time ago. They had a huge computer that told them when 1,000,000 years left but no way to void it? Anything over certain amounts would be flagged and invalidated if not legit.
0062082353|1.0|Chris should have let someone else write this book about him.  He probably would have come across as more sympathetic.  The reason his officers didn't assign him to more missions may be that he's a \\"cadillac\\" when a volkswagon will do.  The government spends A LOT of money to train him. He would probably, under usual circumstances, only be used when his skill sets are needed.

0525478817|5.0|I read this book when it was recently assigned to our book club, knowing only that it was a young adult novel and that the recommendation came from the sixteen year-old son of one of the book club members.  Based upon that limited knowledge, I started reading it with the expectation that it would be light, superficial, and predictable.  I was wrong on all counts.<br /><br />The Fault in our Stars is a beautifully written book that offers a frank view of the lives of teenagers with cancer.  Despite the heavy topic, the book contained a realistic balance of humor and brutal honesty.  As my sixteen year-old recommender stated, it has about a 1:1 laugh to tear ratio.<br /><br />The book left me wanting more (which is the best thing that can be said about any book) so I did a little post-book research and was not surprised to learn that the author had a real relationship with a sixteen year-old girl with cancer, no doubt the inspiration for this exceptional book.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much so quit reading this review . . . and start reading this book yourself.  You won't regret it.  No matter your age, you're not too mature for this young adult book.  In fact, you will likely feel humbled by it.<br /><br />I know I did.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It says it has ads but I haven't noticed any ads. There is not one better game in the app store.

B001F7XIJW|2.0|I had heard some of this bands music and really liked it. I purchased this album. The band has OBVIOUSLY changed stylings. Just fast and 2 dementional. I PERSONALLY dont like it.
B005G4TJUC|3.0|Personally, I found the plot involving the space bridge and Sentinal Prime as traitor to be the most realistic of the three Transformers movies. What kept this movie from being a 5 star is the addition of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly.  First off, we are introduced to her by way of a pantie shot. Then, to \\"prove\\" that this until now unknown girl is in a \\"serious\\" relationship with Sam, she proceeds to stradle him while he is still in bed.  So, not only do we jump from Sam and Mikaela declaring there love for each other at the end of ROTF, we jump ahead to where Mikaela is history and Sam's been with some new girl for a long enough time that he finds her crawling on him to be more annoying than anything else.  This suggests to me that the script was written with Megan Fox in mind, but they had to quickly rewrite because Speilburg had a hissy fit regarding her.  My thoughts on this - if you find working with Megan Fox unbearable, just get a different acress to play the part of Mikaela. It was done in the Dark Knight and in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. It certainly would have made for a better story than the introduction of some girl whose relationship with Sam is less believable than the giant robots turning themselves into cars.  My other problem is the Autobots appearing more ruthless than the Decepticons.  The Autobot position is \\"We're going to kill them all.\\" That's fine, but why have a scene where the autobots are taken prisoner by Decepticons where they are shocked that the Decepticons are going to kill them? If the Autobots have adopted a \\"take no prisoners\\" stance, why should we think it somehow more evil that the Decepticons took the same stance? Same with Dillon hesitating when he had the chance to shoot Sam, yet Sam not hesitating at all when their roles are reversed. It would seem to me that the GOOD guys would be the first to hesitate, not the BAD guys, before killing someone. (This problem, however, is nowhere near as bad as the additionof Carly to the film.)  The movie is quite long as well. If they cut the sophmoric sex jokes and the dull job hunting garbage, and that would cut the movie down to a more reasonable 2 hours.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Okay, I've listened to this new album many times over the weekend.  It is an album for the soul, for the romantic, for the lover in you. It is without a doubt one of McCartneys best albums!  I don't care what anyone says, the mans singing on this album is absolutely stellar! The emotion I hear, the honesty, the heartfelt sincerity that comes thru is at times very moving! I can totally understand why some people have said that certain songs brought them to tears. This is definitely an album for romantics.  I wasn't exspecting such a reaction, but song after song just grabbed me. My Valentine is one of McCartneys best ever, and I'm talking Beatles, Wings, or anything else, it's just so smooth and romantic.  Get Yourself Another Fool is a definite highlight for me, it's one of my very faves by McCartney. It has a soulful bluesy groove and yet it's very smooth and jazzy at the sametime. It's one I will always listen to. A rendition totally worthy of the song.  Accentuate The Positive is another that I just adore, McCartneys vocal is spot on, as it is with many of these songs. I am honestly floored by how delicate and soft the man manages to sing, giving these songs an emotional tone that is just beautiful!  This album should of won a grammy last night (I know that it couldn't) It is that good!  The musicianship is absolutely awesome, with guitars and piano coming in and out at the absolute perfect time. You can really tell that McCartney put his heart and soul into this release, it's a highpoint in his career!  Bravo to Paul McCartney for being brave enough to produce such a work of art!  The haters and naysayers are going to always be there, but there is no denying that McCartney has produced one of his very best albums!! I honestly can't stop listening to this absolutely fantastic album!  Now I hope he's itching to rock, because every since Flowers In The Dirt, Paul McCartney has shown the world that he still writes, plays, and sings plenty of very good music, and that he is much more than just a Beatle!!

B005LAIGRS|4.0|2012's \\"Safe House\\" pairs veteran star Denzel Washington and up-and-comer Ryan Reynolds in a spy thriller set in South Africa.  It offers lots of action, mayhem, and betrayal, served up with action sequences shot in grainy, jumpy footage moving at breathtaking speed.<br /><br />Matt Weston (Reynolds) is a bored young CIA officer, minding a safehouse in Capetown, romancing a local girl, and begging his boss for more action.  Action arrives unexpectedly at the safe house in the form of a CIA team transporting renegade CIA agent Tobin Frost (Washington).  More action arrives unannounced in the form of a well-armed mercenary team seeking Frost.  Weston goes on the run with Frost in tenuous custody.<br /><br />The narrative heart of the movie is the slowly developing relationship between the inexperienced Weston and master manipulator Frost.  As it becomes obvious there is another traitor in the mix, Weston and Frost will be forced to trust one another.  The action culminates in a desparate fight at a remote South African farmhouse.  There is a double ending.<br /><br />\\"Safe House\\" has an interesting plot (despite a surprising flat ending), a very solid cast including the supporting actors, and a good delivery.  Recommended as good entertainment.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like the detailed nature of this weather app on my Kindle Fire. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|Huge set with a removable top piece to reveal a small bridge. Along with the many minifigs, this wa a blast to make and makes a great (if not huge) display piece.  My only complaint is how easily the display 'plaque' can come off it barely touched. Other than that, it was fun to build and always get a compliment when seen.
B006Y5BWQG|1.0|Not sure what the hype is about.  It's only 1 show in (so far).  The first episode was beyond boring.  I tried watching the whole thing but the characters seemed very cliched and unoriginal.  No one really grabbed my attention.  The singing is good, but the somewhere over the rainbow has been heard again and again with katherine mcphee singing it -- again nothing new or original about her rendition.  The story line (thus far) seemed contrived and unnatural.  Will I be watching another episode?  Probably not.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Run a real operating system on this CPU and it will shine (i.e. 64-bit Linux or VMware ESX). Using this CPU in an ESXi 5 system, it has zero problem running multiple Virtual Machines. The cache in this chip really helps with performance. Definitely a great cpu for the price!
0307593312|5.0|Roughly 20 years ago I read \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" in college.  I had to write a paper on it and did very well on the paper.  The only thing I can remember at this point about the book is that I came away feeling that the author has his own vision of reality.  It was similar to the reality that I live in, but definitely not the same.  That doesn't seem to have changed, but I loved the premise for this book.  A person drawn into a separate reality that is very similar to her own, but different.  She named this new reality 1Q84.  It puts in mind of South American magical realism with page after page of could be perfectly normal and acceptable life then throws something out there like there being two moons.  In reviewing books I don't like to summarize or put out spoilers, I try to give the reader an idea of whether or not the book would be interesting to them.  With this book, I'd say that if you are a fan of books like Stephen King's 11/22/63 then you may very well enjoy this book.  It is not fantastical to the point that I'd consider it a fantasy novel and yet it is certainly not based in the reality that we now live in (unless you see two moons!)  Thanks for taking the time to read my review and if you buy it I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Love this movie. Thanks. Shipped quickly and was in perfect condition.  Love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost together. I have Sean of The Dead and Hot Fuzz which I have watched over and over.  There are several big actors in this movie. Using Seth Rogan as the voice of Paul was perfect. I was laughing nearly the entire film.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|This is a great CD.  I just love Kelly Clarkson.  She can hit any note and has gotten better and better over the years.  There are a lot of songs on this CD too.
B005OK81HA|3.0|It's hard to elevate the new (and allegedly, final) Scorpions album \\"Comeblack.\\" For whatever reason, the band decided to revisit some of their greatest hits, along with members' personal favorites. We'll cover the bad news first: the re-recordings offer nothing new. They're basically note-by-rote redoes. I understand that bands occasionally do retreads to get a better royalty rate or creative/licensing control over their songs, but otherwise, why redo a song as perfect as \\"Wind of Change\\" or \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\" for a new tour?<br /><br />Then there's the second half. Who would have guessed that T-Rex or \\"Tainted Love\\" were in the Scorpions' box of guilty pleasures? Or that they'd so totally get off on tearing up on The Kinks' \\"All The Day and All Of The Night\\"? Rudolf Schenker and Matthias Jabs sound like they're have a ball turning T Rex's \\"Children Of The Universe\\" into a crunch fest. Then you get Klaus Meine showing off his genuine vocal chops by tackling The Stones' \\"Ruby Tuesday\\" and The Beatles' \\"Across The Universe.\\" These make the last half of \\"Comeblack\\" into a pretty cool party album. However, it's not going to make me discard my copy of \\"Deadly Sting\\" anytime soon.

B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great game and I love the ease of it. I love playing it. Everyone should try it and I promise you will fall in love with it.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I love uno and this is fun too! Plus, its similar to the electronic versions of life and monopoly but this one if four dollars cheaper!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Great app. Don't listen to the boneheads that don't understand it or for whom it &quot;will not work&quot;. Fantastic for saving videos for later retrieval AND it gets around googles stupid terms of use policy that forbids this exact behavior. 5 stars.
B0071QIN00|4.0|I spend more time upside down than riding because I guess I have a heavy hand on the throttle.  This game has a good concept and the action seems very fast.  Unfortunately for me I have to run fairly slow because I keep pulling wheelies or flipping over.<br /><br />It is going to take me a long time to make it through these challenges.  It takes practice to get the right speed, jumps and braking to make it through many of the courses.  The developers state that this is an unforgiving environment for rookies and they are right on with that comment.<br /><br />The graphics are pretty good and you get the sense of riding on a motorcycle and unfortunately the danger.  My version probably needs an ambulance to come pick me up on almost every level!<br /><br />I am playing the game on the Kindle Fire.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There´s nothing I can say that hasn´t already been said, but this is the first book I´ve read in a LONG time that I couldn´t put down. Don´t let the description decide for you...you won´t regret reading The Hunger Games. Absolutely brilliant.
B000002KK2|5.0|Still Rocks after all these years. Great Buy from a true American original.  I would recommend this c.d. to anyone who likes American music.
B002BWP49M|3.0|These movies have all been some what of a let down for me. The books are so addicting you can not help but want to watch the movies. This one is the worst yet, or maybe it was the hype leading up to it's release. So many things are left out and then breaking it into two parts released so far apart makes you think its detailed...it is not. During the whole movie I waited for it to pick up speed, and it never did, then it ends abruptly. You don't get intangled in the characters lives, and while you are waiting for it to \\"get good\\" you blink its just over..The overall picture and quality is much better than previous parts of the series but thats it. I have come this far in the series and am sure to watch the last, but I am no longer eagerly waiting for its release.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|4 stars only because this particular set didn't come with all the extras along the way (things like making of, behind the scenes, etc.) Other than that this is a must have.

B0014H32MG|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It isn't at all like any other King books I've read before. It can be a little slow to get into but it definitely picks up and it's a fast read. I'd recommend giving it a shot!
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|One of, if not the best sports movie ever. I like the way the actors portayed the real players. I would give it a 9.5 out of 10.

B004EPZ03O|3.0|...because that's the bulk of what this movie has to offer.  The Muppets (2011) is a true Meta-movie; a movie about reviving the Muppets that was, itself, an attempt to breathe life back into those old fabric characters.  It holds a lot of promise - Jason Segel is a talented and funny writer, Amy Adams has been really succesfull in this type of 'fun for the whole family' movie. In fact, the whole project feels like it was brought up with a lot of love and devotion, as apposed to [[ASIN:B001QLIUS6 many]], [[ASIN:B000BKJ758 many]], [[ASIN:B002NXSRVG many]] other nostalgia exploiting endeavors over the past decade that feel more like they've been cooked up in cold, unfeeling offices by ad executives and money hungry moguls.  I have to admit, my hopes were high!  But the Muppets falls flat.  So flat that I'm a little taken a-back by the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  It's strange to chalk that all up to fond memories of yester-year and an overwhelming hunger to see the Muppets back in their former, razor whitted, unnappologetically insane, glory... but I can't see what else would keep your interest throughout.  It's not a bad movie, not by any means. But I can only see it being a 'great' movie if you really, really want it to be.  It's hard to point the finger at any specific problem... Oh, wait, no it's not: our three leads - Gary (Segel), Mary (Adams) and Walter, Gary's twin (?) brother who's a Muppet... or something.  He's a puppet, but maybe he's not a 'Muppet'?  Something like that.  Point is we spend a lot of time with them - the actual Muppets don't show up for maybe twenty minute, and even then it's just Kermit sounding like he's already taken his Valium for the evening.  We spend so much time following these three around and focusing on their needs (Marriage, identity, family) that it almost stops feeling like a Muppet movie and more like a mediocre kids movie about letting go and growing up.  And the worst part is that these three non-muppet protagonists were ABSOLUTELY NECCESSARY.  We needed SOMETHING to drag the muppets into the 2010's, they couldn't just show up - too much time has passed.  And that something turned out to be mostly uniteresting and unsatisfying.  The greatest failing of this new Muppet movie is that it's boring.  There are jokes (some good ones), but they're too far and few between.  The character arcs (there are character acrs: credit where credit is due) are mostly thin and hastily wrapped up in-part because there's so many of them.  The celebrity cameos are neat and sort of a novelty, but mostly brief and rarely funny.  The song and dance numbers involve more humans than Muppets and are a little too silly and kiddish to get involved in.  I was bored frequently, the kids around me in the theatre were noticably (often vocally) bored.  It was kind of a shame...  But...  What if this is exaclty what this movie NEEDED to be?  What if this is followed by two or three or even four Muppet movies not bogged down by excess exhibition or boring characters?  I should certainly mention and respect the fact that it was no small feet to (almost literally) drag these throwback chacaters of 80's nostalgia into a modern scene.  But, if they move forward with more movies (with tighter scripts, hopefully), there won't need to be any dragging at all.  They're here, they exist again, and when they get to be themselves, the Muppets are as funny as ever.  Maybe we'll all be able to look back at this one as that sort of 'eh' Muppet Movie that launched a new wave of great ones...  Here's hoping!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I am really enjoying this app. I love to use it in Church. It helps me keep up with our Pastor and understand him better. I am really impressed.
1594484805|5.0|Loved this book! Engaging, well written, and a lot of food for thought.  As a person starting their own volunteer organization, this book provided tons of important information about what makes people tick. I've hopefully avoided making some very serious mistakes in how I structure things for expansion.  As a student looking into different careers, this book helped clarify why I'd been so miserable in my former lab but fairly happy where I am now. It also made me see where I can make adjustments to improve my motivation further.  As a resident of the global economy, I have to wonder about the one topic the author didn't directly address: how is a worker supposed to earn a living in Motivation 3.0? I tip my hat to the builders of Wikipedia, Linux, and Firefox, but I can't think of a good way for them to turn a wonderful free service into an adequate source of paychecks. Perhaps the next book.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|It's a shame there are so many closed minded listeners out there. I applaud Paul for releasing an album of great music that he and countless others love, and for doing the unexpected. His voice sounds wonderful on every track. His phrasing is just perfect. People who accuse him of hitting rock bottom or of running out of new material obviously haven't listened to his two most recent albums, or to the two originals on this album, both of which are among his best. They certainly must not have seen him in concert recently, because if they had they would know he can rock as hard as anyone one third his age. This album exists because he followed his heart, and had some fun. Anyone with ears that can hear and an opened mind will be amply rewarded. Thanks, Paul.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|After going back and listening to \\"19\\", it's clear just how far Adele has come in a few short years. Tracks 1, 2, and 5 have to be my favorites- I can't not sing along!<br /><br />This entire album is just gold. Even my boyfriend, who was very resistant to listening to Adele at first, loves the album.<br /><br />If you were put off by the bare bones of \\"19\\", please don't hesitate to pick up \\"21\\". She's come a long way since then.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this is a fun collection of mini games. Ive always liked mini games . Kind of like Some Wii games.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|My Kindle Fire fits very snugly into this case- I'm not afraid of it going anywhere! I like that the cover has the little pocket on the other side, although I still haven't gotten the hang of fitting my hand in there to fold it back while reading (maybe my hands are just short).<br /><br />The color is excellent, and so far it's done a great job of protecting my Kindle from being damaged. =)
1933633867|5.0|Graeber's work is a serious challenge to prevailing conceptions of economics. Indeed he makes the entire field look like a bunch of ninny fools!
B0045DO8NI|5.0|Pink is one of my all-time favorite artists. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better after Funhouse, she has to go and come out with \\"Raise Your Glass\\" and \\"F*kn Perfect\\". As of today, this album is the only place to get those two songs in physical form.<br /><br />This includes all of the classic Pink songs from her early work up to today. If you're jonesing for a blast from the past along with the modern hits, I recommend picking up this album.<br /><br />The DVD is great too, giving you all of the music videos so far. The physical packaging itself is gorgeous, featuring photos from a shoot she did (if I'm remembering correctly, the DVD includes video from this shoot), and includes some awesome color-changing inks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the different games.  my kids cant wait to earn enough points to unlock.more games.  addicting!!!  love it.  keeps them entertained
B0054JZC6E|4.0|cant stop playing! so addicting! once you start you wont be able to stop. some of the games are harder than others but so far all is beatable!
0783231032|5.0|I grew up watching all kinds of goofy comedies growing up with my dad.  Everything from Revenge of the Nerds to Animal House to pretty much anything by Mel Brooks.  1941 was also one of those movies and I purchased it so me and my dad could watch it again.  We laughed just as hard now as we did then.  With actors like John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, John Candy and a slew of actors you will immediately recognize when you see them, this film will have you laughing from start to finish.
0061969656|5.0|I had read the previous 5 books, but read them again just before receiving \\"Death of Kings\\".  This book is excellent, in my opinion, as well as the previous 5.  I truly enjoy Bernard Cornwell's Saxon novels.  His knowledge of the times is excellent and his description of battles and human behavior in the shield is amazing.  I have just started reading his Arthur novels.
B006LRUVUA|3.0|The app works as advertised although response time can be a little slow. It should also be noted that the control scheme for touch devices need work. The app has a hard time distinguishing between left right and middle clicks. Yes, there are onscreen buttons for that but they do not always work. Also there was not audio. If these issues were resolved it would receive 5 stars.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Why is this movie so strong? Maybe because it takes its time. And because it is full of surprises. Nicolas Winding Refn shows the hollywood mainstream what it lacks: time and timing. And masterfully shows how to play with these parameters. Just let yourself carry away by the gorgeous score and enjoy the fresh spirit of this movie.
B00466HM28|4.0|Akai lives up to its name in quality. Rather it be as big as Akai custom furniture, or as small as the Akai midi keyboard for the iPhone. With 25 keys easily mapped. 8 pads x2 banks giving the user 16 pads to beat on. 8 knobs easily mapped for those awesome rotary effects. user interface is as easy as it gets. its a great buy!

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|A sequel to another awful movie. I would rather have my eyes gouged out than watch this again. I will never get the time back i spent watching this crappy movie.
B003L77GGA|5.0|The last season of Smallville is extremely well done.  All the loose ends are tied up and some of our favorite characters return.  It is much lighter than season 9, with sweet story lines and happy endings.  I love it!!
0062082353|3.0|This book to me was good.I believe that the marine sniper book is alot better.It tells you alot about his life in as well as out of the service.It was slow in some spots then picked up in others.I wish it gave more details about his sniper skills.In marine sniper you feel like your out there on the mission with him.Good book but not great.
B005URRCUY|4.0|is a outright winner. There are enough good songs on this album to make it worth the purchase. While music is a personal choice I think that most people would find the value in the list. I have recommended this album to many of my friends...and now I'm doing it here:). enjoy if you buy. I preordered the album after hearing Lonley boys, but my favorite tune turned out to be sister.
B003EY7IRC|2.0|I haven't read any of her other books and after working my way through this series I wouldn't be bothering. It was recommended by a colleague and we have spent the past week having a laugh at the absurdity of some of the sub-plots and the amount of sex. I think Porn for Housewives is a how I would market this book.  I also agree with many that feel this could have been wrapped up as a trilogy instead of 5 books. I'm not fussed that Mac is a bit dense and constantly needs saving, a less than perfect heroine is refreshing.  I think my biggest annoyance was that every 5 pages Mac and Barrons or Mac and V'Lane or Mac and Darroc or Mac and whoever else seems to be standing are stripping off and going for it hammer and tongs or talking about it. I love sex as much as the next person but it actually began to hinder the story and turn it in to a joke.  *spoiler*  You can't seriously expect anyone to believe that somebody that has spent thousands of years chasing a book to save there son, killing people who stand in his way and then when it appears under his nose is completely apathetic and decides to spend the next 3 days in bed with Mac...time and time again....spare me
1441711228|4.0|Great read, really enjoyed the stories and the reader.  Brings the books to life!  Nice short stories, listened with my 14 year old son - we both thought these were great!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Haven't opened it but the whole idea of the series being in one box is great and at a great price too!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This album George Martin created with his son , was the best album I have heard in awhile, it's an album you can just listen to over and over again , you can't just have one song ..I have caught myself listening to the entire album over and over again...I hope Gerorge Martin and son , have a little something left over for another  grovvey album.. Peace love and Beatles...
B0068FZ196|4.0|I already own all of the Bourne films on DVD but I just had to have this Blu-ray version of the film. This is by far the best of the 3 Bourne films and one of Matt Damon's best films. The Universal 100th anniversary packaging is pretty cool and features a brief summary of the Bourne series as well as a timeline featuring some of the other 100th anniversary movies that Universal has released. The only issue I had was redeeming my digital copy. For some reason the code I typed in was invalid and I was not able to download the digital copy. The website features a \\"support\\" area which is filled with FAQs that are somewhat irrelevant. This is still a cool set and a very good movie.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is really a great game and the different modes are so fun! the ads I barely notice, I have never encountered any zombie or inappropriate ads. The only thing causing me not to give it 5 stars is that on my kindle fire sometimes the screen goes mostly black and then I have to exit and restart. The ads can easily be exited out of. Overall I really love this game and I definitely recommend this for all ages I just had a couple minor setbacks :)
B0054N73EY|3.0|Its not the lyrics.  Its not the rhythm section, Flea and Chad Smith are tight as ever(c'mon, Chads been jamming with guys that are almost rock royalty [Satch and Hagar]).  One of Chads best drumming outtings.  Its not production,  Rubin is the master Producer of the 90's, 00's now 10's (yes he is beginning to let it slip a little, but hey, he is also the co-president of Columbia records).  Maybe mastering.  No \\"phasing\\", no \\"channeling/tracking\\", no \\"reverse tracking/splicing\\" {such as in the great song \\"Suck My Kiss}, output levels are a bit \\"shot\\".  Maybe the writing process. Flea is quoated he wrote the majority of the album on piano.  Now ANY musician knows its great to start at a piano, but even the great Chuck Berry had to change the key of songs due to his pianist.  The album is short, (59 minutes, barely) in comparrison to every RHCP album since \\"Mothers Milk\\" (70 minutes plus)[All double LP's].  But the big let down for the Chili's, let down for this one, is the man on the 6 strings, the guitar!  Its ALL basic chords and basic chord-structure, and if its not that, he's just making noises such as feedback and echoing on harmonics.  Furthermore, I dont think I've heard a single \\"guitar break\\", a propper solo.  John Frusciante was, and still is, a mastermind.  He took the basics of the man before that jammed his soul OUT before him, the genius for whom created the RHCP sound, Hillel Slovak (for may you rest in peace) and expanded that with sounds another legend, the great James Marshall Hendrix, the rock GOD, Jimi!  At least Navarro can rock, keep up the pace, the funk, and his techniques are similar to Frusciante, maybe even a little more, experimental (change of tuning, just to begin with).  But here, there's nothing, a huge gap, and is what is missing, from this being yet another great Red Hot Chili Peppers album.  Just like the front cover sujests, its missing something, and what is it that fly's love to hover around?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my kids love it they always play this game they call me in the living and me to watch them play it
B004XDYJRU|4.0|by far the best radio app out there. only suggestion is to add a feature to organize your favorites.  then, 5 stars.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Reading about the death of Whitney Houston over the weekend gave me a cold shock. She was so young. She had great looks, and a great voice to match. Everyone is familiar with her music. We will all miss her.  This is a terrific collections of some of her songs.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm so glad I found a Bible app.Plus when I get scared I just read it.It really helps at a young age.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Quiet, elegant, and a little provocative... this game is well worth the ninety nine cents.  If you like problem solving, this is a good &quot;fit&quot; for you.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|The swivel sweeper does all that it advertises to do. And that should be enough to recommend it, which I do to all my friends. It is is perfect for light duty sweep ups. The battery lasted for 4 years and is replaceable.
B000057DON|1.0|This record arrived promptly but it skips horribly and is completely unplayable. (This is obviously not a comment on the quality of the album itself -- which is great -- but the product.)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the greatest game ever everyone would enjoy this so therefore you should download it you will really enjoy it
B0035JRVBO|5.0|AWESOME!! I watched it a lot when I was little!! Never gets old! I love it! Not like any movie I have ever seen! 5 stars!
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Suspenseful, intense, and keeps you on the edge of the cliff and your seat. Strap in and enjoy the ride.
1451627289|3.0|Great concept, and some brilliant passages, but this book could be so much better!  Too many pages, too many sub-plots, too complex for obtaining the resulting message. Whereas many of Stephen's books know how to build the most effective trade-off of plot and character development to keep the reader turning pages, I found that I would keep putting this one down... it was too long in getting there. With a plot so obvious from the get-go, don't keep the reader waiting, Stephen. This novel does not fit into the kind of work that I would expect from the man who wrote the best work on writing I've ever read... \\"On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.\\" Time to reread your own advice and to look at the works of folks like Jack London who were short but sweet.
B005ARYEPK|5.0|One of my favorite CD's of all time.  Bought to listen to with friends on New Years Eve.  Absolutely love every song on the soundtrack..
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great version of a tried and true application. It's playable and very fast. The app is changeable too.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|to be perfect needs to be compatible with .doc but is an awesome app to take some notes like this app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very well made ...... the app flows very well, not very much lag at all .... its not another piece-of-crap-app
B006UG90RM|3.0|I'll open this review by saying I realize I'm in the vast minority with my rating. (As of this writing, less than 20% of the reviewers have given the album three or fewer stars.) My hope is that people will understand I'm sharing my open-minded opinion of the music and won't thumbs-down the review just because it doesn't align with their own opinions.<br /><br />First, the good...<br /><br />I'm absolutely impressed with how well each individual band member has held up over the years. In terms of technique and chops, I don't think Eddie has flagged one bit; his riffs and solos are just as clean and blazing as ever. Diamond Dave's attitude remains fresh and slightly obnoxious in the way VH fans like myself enjoy, and although he's not screaming and squealing orgasmically as much as he did in the late '70s, he doesn't come across as a watered-down version of himself like so many singers do when they're well past their prime but trying so hard to believe they've still got it. What can I say about Alex? While he's not showing much flash--nor does he need to--he still lays down the bedrock well enough. What really surprised and pleased me is how well Wolfgang slid into Michael Anthony's slot. He's got a smooth vocal upper range and his playing is like a clock, the perfect foil to Eddie's fretboard pyrotechnics. Wolfie even shows off a bit of technical complexity here and there without stepping on anyone's toes. The kid definitely has musician's blood in his veins.<br /><br />Now the not-so-good...<br /><br />Like everyone else reading and writing these reviews, I was completely pumped in anticipation of this release. Michael wouldn't be part of the project, which was a bit of a bummer, but we all saw that coming. Just to hear Eddie and Dave collaborating again full-bore more than piqued my interest and got me hopefully wondering. Would they challenge and inspire each other as they did thirty years ago? Would they create new sounds to be later imitated but never duplicated by others? Did they have more Camaro-blasting burger joint classics in them? Most importantly, would they rock hard?<br /><br />ADKOT answered those questions for me, unfortunately not in the direction I'd hoped. Clearly from the reviews here, on various music sites, and in magazines and newspapers across the country, it's rocking a lot of people...I'm just not one of them. That's too bad, because so many folks out there are making comparisons between this latest opus and classics like Women and Children First and Fair Warning. I don't hear it. Hey, maybe it's my fault for not being sixteen anymore. When those earlier albums first came out, they had a certain something at once sexy, dark, and playful that insinuated itself into my teenage id. They inspired me to--for better or for worse--play guitar loudly, drive fast, and spray-paint my tiny universe in crisscrossed red, white and black stripes. Then again, maybe I just haven't given this album enough spins. The way it works for me with albums, at least most of the time, is a handful of tracks grab me right out of the gate while others are slower to reveal their charms.<br /><br />So far, this new album hasn't revealed a single jaw-dropper. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to find even a thirty-second block of music that might just blossom into something great after multiple listenings (although the fade-out to \\"As Is\\" is a strong contender at the moment). The most ADKOT has done to this point is made me go back to the classic DLR-era cuts to see if I could define their mystique for myself. Maybe through that exercise I could put a finger on what I feel is lacking today. While most of what's missing amounts to an intangible spark at least partially attributable to what was my own coming of age at the time, there are a few aspects I can point to as what I consider definite weaknesses on ADKOT.<br /><br />BACKUP VOCALS: Most great DLR-era tracks feature Eddie and Mike on backup vocals. These vocal harmonies are an instantly-recognizable VH fingerprint. What's more, they tie VH to a rock 'n' roll, R&B and Motown tradition, one in which the song was built on vocal melody. Perhaps the most important aspect of these backup vocals is that they elevate great tracks to anthem status as they become eminently singable to the masses. In the case of ADKOT, many of the vocal harmonies (to my ears) are built around multi-tracks of Dave's own voice. Instead of that great call-and-response vocal dynamic found in songs like \\"Runnin' With the Devil,\\" \\"Unchained,\\" and \\"Jamie's Cryin',\\" you get The Diamond Dave Show, which isn't my brand of whiskey. Yes, there are background oohs and aahs, but nothing like the construction of the aforementioned VH classics.<br /><br />EXPERIMENTATION: There's always been at least one track, be it a proper song or an intro to another song, that featured some level of instrumental experimentation, like the sound engineer let the Van Halen kids run amok in the control room for an afternoon and left the tape recorder running. It's that kind of musical curiosity that resulted in \\"Sunday Afternoon in the Park,\\" \\"Intruder,\\" and parts of \\"And the Cradle Will Rock...,\\" to name just a few moments of sonic chaos gone right. I feel like the Van Halen kids have grown up and are playing nicely with their toys now. Makes me want to say, \\"C'mon, guys. Grab a pair of scissors and RUN!!!\\"<br /><br />SONGWRITING: This is by far the most subjective and undefinable element for me to criticize, but I feel the songs lack the musical depth and level of interest I've come to expect from early VH. This ties into the experimentation point at least partially, but taking the songs as a whole, I'm not getting any of that same air-guitar or singalong joy from these tunes that I'd hoped for. Never do I get to the end of any one song and say to myself, \\"Dayum, I just *gotta* hear that again,\\" reaching for the iPod's back button. Nothing here is great all the way through for me. On the other hand, I could listen to \\"Somebody Get Me a Doctor\\" on repeat for an hour or more and be perfectly happy. Again, one of the more personal and subjective critiques.<br /><br />PRODUCTION QUALITY: I dunno, maybe it's just how things are done these days, but I agree with an earlier reviewer who said the tracks sound spatially squashed. Ninety percent of the sound is pushing through the center channel. Feels like someone took all the furniture out of a Beverly Hills mansion and crammed it into a studio apartment on the Lower East Side. But it's not just about the separation; the EQ sounds muddier. Part of that that is due to Eddie's brown sound becoming more saturated, which has taken away a lot of the clarity. Every musician has a golden tone in his or her head, and maybe this is a step closer to that tone for Eddie, or maybe it's the evolution of his own ideal. Either way, it's a step further from what I want to hear. Too muddled and overblown.<br /><br />Overall, I'm giving this album three stars, because while it's not making me want to dive in more and more with every listen, it's not actively pushing me away either. I'll still come back to it on occasion, and maybe I'll discover new gems every now and again.<br /><br />In the meantime, be cool. Stay frosty.ly-recognizable VH fingerprint.

B000SP3DE2|2.0|Francis Coppola's loyal translation of a classic piece of literature merely proves that many times some new wrinkles are necessary to interpret a printed property for the screen. Visually ambitious but thematically dreary, it often seems like a thin excuse to try out some of Hollywood's craziest ideas in wardrobe, set design, hairstyling and film editing. I'll tip my hat to Coppola's dedication to his craft; his demands that the entirety of the film's effects be produced in-camera have given the picture an eerie look entirely its own. When they're working, their influence makes the whole picture seem hazy, uncertain and ghostly, like a foggy, lucid dream. When it all goes wrong, though - and this happens fairly regularly - the illusion shatters and once deathly-serious scenes become downright hysterical. A super-heavyweight cast can do little, if anything, with a script so overcooked and while I'll always welcome a healthy dose of indulgent sex scenes, they really don't seem to have a point here.

0385534639|4.0|...but the 'Prestige' just didn't unfold.  I was so besotted with the early stages of this novel. Through almost a hundred pages. But there is a massive difference between a 'wonderful first novel that so many people enjoy', and a 'great novel', period.  In order to accomplish the latter, a rookie has to not just have a great premise injected with audacity and style and flair...but the ability to...to...  It's the difference between a 'vocalist' and a 'singer'.  There's mastery at work when a début novel is a phenomenal accomplishment. And as good as this effort is, there was something lacking. For me, undeniably lacking.  I'll be honest and say that I suspect that two elements stood in her disfavour: the use of present-tense to tell the tale, and the economical style of prose.  Ms Morgenstern might have gotten away with the latter had she provided more oomph in the paucity of sentences. But I never felt I was in the presence of a great writer.  And the former- Well, I believe that it played against her at times, even though it's perfect for accentuating action, showcasing a rich development.  On top of these two aspects, the third act...sank.  I kept waiting for a magnificent conclusion...but there was no deftness-of-touch when it came to the 'star-crossed lovers' portion of the story, nothing that was heightened sufficiently to match the opening segments, nothing transcendent...which, given all the components, should have been there.  (And I have to add this: I was so taken by the tale initially that I went so far as to send the author a copy of a short screenplay I'd written years back, because her novel resonated with the same tone, a twinned sense of loving wonder.)
B00005BGV2|5.0|It's great. The sound is amazing. It has reached all my expectations. I recomend it to all Tool fans (with a vinyl player). You have more sound definition on vinyl than on cd. Just try it!
B0071QIN00|2.0|Why do these types of games so quickly devolve into an exercise in frustration? The difficulty curve comes not from clever level design, but rather by inserting obstacles that are near impossible to pass and are totally uninteresting to boot. The game should be called Trial and Error Extreme.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Wow, what a find!  I've dropped my Kindle Fire a few times now while it's been in this cover and it's remained unscathed!  This cover is so sleek and light, you barely even notice that it's a cover.  Plus, I like the fact that you can prop up the KF in it so you don't have to hold it in your hands to watch videos, play music, etc.  I got it in white and it stays pretty clean.

B004M9AS3Y|5.0|I recently bought the compuday 250 and tried it out.  for my needs its perfect! I could not be happier.  Pros:  - smallest all around backpack I have seen. Not bulky or big yet fits a lot!  - easy to carry with good weight distribution. I tried fully loaded with laptop, iPad, camera, and a couple of lenses.  - fits everything I need for travel (not just camera gear) therefore I don't need to carry normal backpack and camera bag.  - does not scream \\"I have expensive camera in here\\" which is good for travel.  - side pocket amazing for easy access. You don't need to take off the backpack or put it down.  Cons:  - only main camera compartment is isolated. Therefore additional lens are just there in the main pouch all together. However I bought lens pouches from ebay for $2 and that solved the problem.  - bottom not flat so if you do put it down it will not stand up.  Just remember this is NOT a camera backpack. It is an all around packpack with camera compartment. That means if you only care about carrying all your camera gear everywhere you go then this not for you!

B005EM8O8O|2.0|The subject matter has a lot of possibilities - hedge funds, algorithmic trading, and artificial intelligence - but the story is thin, the characters flat, and the mystery unexplained. It seems that Robert Harris knows something about trading and 21st century markets, but just kind of held back and crafted a plot for the lowest common denominator. Straight to screenplay to video.
1439153663|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much and I found it very interesting to note that not only the blacks in the kitchen house were \\"slaves\\" but the wives of the \\"masters\\" were also slaves, just for a different reason, hence their addiction to opium to survive?  Very interesting and a good read.
B0051GY0LS|1.0|I gave this book 1 star because I found no typos in it. That's about all that commends this sorry excuse for a novel.<br /><br />Here's a quick plot synopsis, to save all of you the agony of throwing away your money on this piece of bird-brained crapola:<br /><br />Theodore's friend, April, comes from a dysfunctional family. While her mom disappears leaving the girl home alone, her estranged father shows up and takes her away with him to tour with his rock band. Her friends and police think she has been abducted by an escaped convict known to be in the area. They arrest him and he pretends to know about April. Meanwhile Theodore's drunken and disbarred uncle helps him crack the case by inspiring him to track her down using Facebook. They find her at a frat party in North Carolina and bring her home. That's it.<br /><br />The first Boone book was excellent, so I was very disappointed that this one is so pathetic. It's as though Grisham is writing to fulfill a contractual obligation to his publisher while sitting on the toilet. There is zero inspiration or suspense in this literary con-job.<br /><br />Repeatedly in the book Grisham notes that April's father is an aging hippie with a lousy rock band. Grisham might be projecting here, for this book makes Grisham seem like an aging autbor who has lost all his talent and is good now at only one thing: fleecing his audience like the sheister lawyers he loves to portray in his books.<br /><br />Grisham should just hang up his keyboard, live off his ample income, and spend the rest of his life really helping kids by coaching little league, as his book jackets often claim about him.<br /><br />If you really like Grisham (the way a person, recalling a nice fling many years ago, might return to his now aging and ugly friend), consider sending him directly the price of the book and spare yourself the shame, pain and embarassment of reading this piece of trash. And if you just can't resist peeking inside, then go the library and check it out there. I would recommend turning directly to chapter 13 on page 112 to read about the antics of a parrot that terrorizes a local equestrian riding school. You also could read this one half-way entertaining chapter (out of about 20 total) over a cup of coffee at B&N.<br /><br />It's one thing to rip off adult audiences, as Grisham's latest books have been doing, but with this new juvenile series Grisham is committing far worse than fraud: he is veering towards child abuse.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Shakespeare Stealer Series by Gary Blackwood as a superb children's literary experience!<br /><br />Don't buy this book though. The only person abducted by this book is its purchaser and reader.<br /><br />In Jesus' Name, AMENapter 13 on page 112 to read about the antics of a parrot that terrorizes a local equestrian riding school.

B003QP4NPE|4.0|Plot 5/5  The story starts with Detective Peter Sebeck investigating a mysterious death, which leads him, a computer illiterate, down the unfamiliar territory of the cyber world. What he comes to learn is that a now deceased video game designer, Matthew Sobol, unleashed a computer program upon the world, but this program--the Daemon--is not any ordinary computer program. The Daemon apparently has a goal (Sobol's goal), and it will go as far as murder to achieve those goals. Sebeck and other characters must find a way to stop the Daemon before it brings chaos to the globe.  Characters 3/5  Although Sebeck is easy to root for, the point of view changes to several other characters, and I just couldn't get behind them in any meaningful way. Gragg's sadistic view of the world makes him interesting, to say the least. Everyone else just seemed too cookie-cutter.  Summary  The premise of this novel is what holds it together, and it is compelling. Suarez explains much of the technology in a way that is easy to understand. The novel does end on a cliffhanger, but luckily the sequel is available and wraps up many of the dangling subplots.  Age Rating  If this were a movie, it would definitely be rated R for violence, sex and language.
B006OT03BM|5.0|The Transformers case is very large.  Impressive.  BEWARE:  Check over the playability.  The first blu ray - movie Transformers stopped 3/4 through and when Megan Fox is looking into the car the movie paused and started and did it again.  I could see bright lines in the disk.  Other that this the collection is great/  Clear picture and great sound.
0316017930|5.0|What can I say!  Read this on a long flight to Western Australia and thanked God I had an Australian pilot.  An excellent read, explodes the inflated belief in the self made man.  I find myself constantly giving this book away to friends particularly those with children because of the way it puts IQ in its place.
B006UG909U|5.0|Please dont let mixed reviews of 'Tattoo' taint your opinion of this CD.  Some people liked it, others didnt.  Everyone who has heard the new CD agrees that it should not have been the first single.  Tattoo is simply the one that record company execs thought might have the most Top 40 radio appeal.  This worked fine in the Hagar era, but the Roth incantation of Van Halen is a different animal.  Hagar's era saw an extremely impressive collection of songs that everyone liked, but no one really loved.  With Roth, Van Halen produces music that not everyone likes, but the millions who do absolutely love it.  This has always been the difference between Roth and Hagar.  A Different kind of Truth is a complete return to form, and will be a very serious contender for hard rock album of the year.  It is without question the hardest rocking album in Van Halen's history.  You will find no ballads here.  For those who are familiar with Van Halen's catalog, this sounds like it could have been released right between Fair Warning and Women and Children First.  Many of the songs began taking form right around this time.  EVH's seems to take out 14 years of fury on this CD.  He is absolutely amazing at a time when the guitar has become a lost art.  Dave's voice, always more rocker than singer, sounds perfect.  His lyrics are, as usual, a mix of genius and lunacy.  Rather than rate each song, which are all quite good, I think its better to group them as such....  The Singles (enough appeal to both Van Halen fans and casual listeners for serious airplay)  She's the Woman  You and Your Blues  Blood and Fire  Tattoo  Beats Workin  Big River  Trouble With Never  The Punks (Hard and fast with a definite punk attitude)  Bullethead  Honeybabysweetiedoll  The Bs (not for everyone, but could be your personal favorite.  Van Halen excells at these)  China Town  As Is  Stay Frosty  Outta Space

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it. It reads to you and has so many versions. You can even set plans for the emotions that you feel in your life.Giving you scriptures to read to help you through it.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I was hesitant to buy this e-book after reading the reviews, but since David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors, I bought it anyway.  I was not disappointed.  It was a very good, entertaining read. Although the main character is an army investigator, the similarity with Lee Child's Affair is really minor.  The character may be similar in description, however, the story was completely different. I enjoyed this book like all of Baldacci's books.

Somebody please help me. My email address is allison.hoop@yahoo.com. Thanks!
B005K200NK|5.0|I am thrilled to see this book for my Kindle! I only hope that the rest of the series will follow! I loved the Little House books growing up and read them over and over. Reading Little House in The Big Woods brought back so many memories for me. It still holds up as a great book even now that I am in my 30's. Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! I can only hope that a whole new generation of kids gets a chance to enjoy these lovely books!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is an awesome fun variety of games. I deffinetally recommend downloading this app. its also free so don't worry about those pricey apps!

B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is all of the movies. Can't beat it at the price. I have watched all of them with my kids. (They actually read the books). I am now a Harry Potter expert. Well, familiar with it. Ahh well, watched the movies... All the movies. No special features, but that is OK.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|I owned a pair of turtle beach X4's, not X41's, but after good use, I broke them, so I decided to buy another pair, but I could only find X41's. Figured it'd be a good buy. Don't think I could have been more wrong. I'm so glad I got these for Christmas cuz if I wasted 140$ of my own money I'd be more pissed than I already am. Transmit the tv audio to the headphones, yes they do that. But it is frequently switching audio channels or something and causing the audio to cut out while transmitting this god awful static. And xbox life chat, don't worry, you'll surely be deaf before long. The volume chat to hear others goes from a volume where I can't hear anything to overbearingly loud with barely moving the knob at all, not to mention my friends all complain about how loud I am thanks to my mic. Don't waste your money. I don't know what to recommend in its place, but I will for sure be looking.
0060558121|3.0|This book disturbed me.  I guess, in part, that's what the author had in mind.  It had a very dreamlike quality.  Characters seemed to come and go, and at many times with no reason.  I was not familiar enough with many of the mythological characters in the book, and many times I felt like there were inside jokes that I was not getting that I would understand if I knew more about world mythologies.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This cover is exactly what I was looking for.  It's lightweight and easy to use.  My Kindle Fire fits snuggly in this cover and provides the the protection I wanted to be able to take my Kindle with me everywhere I go.

B005K2YZ5E|2.0|The Kindle Fire does not fit in this sleeve nor do the regular kindles. It looks nice but not a good fit.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Being a busy freshman in college, I had to wait until February 10th to listen to it. I got it in the mail on the 8th, but had been too busy to listen to it. Once I finally finished listening to it, and saw the bonus DVD, I feel I must say what everyone else has been saying, this is an INCREDIBLE album. I know I'll listen to it again and again, just as I have been with all other Van Halen albums. This album continues to make me proud to own a copy of every Van Halen album between my dad and I.
0553826166|5.0|My sister suggested this author. I've started reading the first in the Reacher series. It's fast paced and I can see how it would appeal to male and female. I'm not sure it will be among my favorites yet, but I don't want to stop reading it, so that says a lot for me. If it didn't hold my interest, I'd just close the book and forget it.
1592537251|5.0|The sketches are truly inspiring, often stunning, and proof positive of how effective sketching can be at capturing the essence of a moment in time and space. The range of techniques and styles shows how drawing is as individual as handwriting. Most sketches seem to be done in watercolour (often wildly colourful), with many black on white pen sketches, as well as pencil and pastel.  I've spent hours leafing through the book while reading all the tiny clues and insights explaining how each sketch was realized.  This is a beautifully designed and cleverly edited book, a joy to read and look at, and is a sure bet to motivate all who read it to go out and draw what they see.  A must have for all who draw, highly recommended!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|despite all of the negative feedback others have given this book, I honestly thought it was the best book in the series.  yes, it did have a different feel since instead of being fast paced excitement from the hunger games, it was fast paced excitement about the war.  From cover to cover, this book kept me on edge.  I can tell you right now that I think the reason so many have given such bad reviews is because this book took the series from a sci-fi romance trilogy to a more of a war novel.  Yes, of course there is still that glint of romance that katniss has for both of her little boy toys, but this book proves that there are much bigger matters at hand.  katniss realizes how much she took the both of them for granted.  so there isnt that fairy tale ending that most want, but there is still happyness to be found in the end.  I love it because i doubt theyl end up making this last book into a stupid movie that has such a strong resemblence to effing twilight.  every little girl in america would cry because their fairy tail didnt work out.
0061900656|5.0|I bought this for my two year old and it's just right for his level of development.  He's not very interested in listening to the book because of his other competing books.  However, the book is clear and concise.  The potty book by this author is also great for toddlers.
B004I744AS|5.0|so simple and fast plus has other fun features like daily word games, trivia and horoscope all on one page. love it!
B004HW7JMO|5.0|You either love this Starz series or you hate it. I happend to love this prequel. I like the actors and I have watched the first season as well. Too bad that Andy Whitfield died of cancer because he was a great Spartacus. The prequel is about Crixus and Ganicus. I can't wair for season 2 to come out on DVD.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like the fact that adults and kids can play. perfect for when you inned to catch up on things and little ones need something to keep them occupied
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing. You cannot sit it down. The ending is abrupt though and it is kinda violent. But still five stars
B005W0OK3G|5.0|if you enjoy Hawaiian music--this is one you should have in your collection.  The various selections just reminds me of how beautiful Hawaii is.  I just thought about the how great the music was while I was watching a great movie too.
B004APVI1G|5.0|This film was a lot of fun to watch. It is by far one of the best 3D films that I have ever seen. There are a lot of post coverted films that are horrible. This one was made with 3D in mind, and it shows. The storyline is similar in theme with Star Wars/Lord of the Rings, so it isn't ground breaking in that respect. But, the animation is amazing. The owls look great, and the slow motion shots that Zach Snyder is known for look fantastic in 3D. I highly recommend this film. It's a lot of fun.

B000RD0RDU|3.0|I needed to replace a noisy case cooling fan in a JVC micro-HiFi system. I was worried about the fit of the new fan, which was not a problem, because the size, case and blade shape, and mounting holes' positions of the Skythe fan were identical to the fan I was replacing.<br /><br />However, I made an incorrect assumption that all 40mm x 40mm x 10mm fans would be absolutely the same, which is NOT the case. The differences are in RPM and CFM. Skythe fan is very quiet, but it also runs at 60% RPM (3500 vs. 6000) and pushes 64% CFM (4.1 vs. 6.4) of the original fan. I discovered this after I installed Skythe fan and could not tell whether it was running because it was not making any noise and the airflow out of the vent was practically undetectable. The JVC stereo turns the fan on and off as needed, and it was not running when I soldered it on. I had to put the case back together and play a CD twice and then take the case apart while the stereo was plugged in to see whether the fan was indeed running.  It was, but very little air was being pushed by it.<br /><br />I am going to replace it with a fan with specs that are closer to the original fan's specs. I was looking at the Link Depot's ball bearing 40mm x 10mm fan, but several users on newegg complained about the noise, so I have purchased a sleeve bearing ARX Ceradyne-A FD1240-A2012A from xsfans.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good quiet fan, but make sure it suits your needs.  If you are looking for more cooling than your current fan , this fan is probably not it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. It is entertaining, makes you exercise your brain and it is free! I would recommend to anybody looking for a passtime.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I never write reviews, but I wanted to add a couple comments on this one.  Net net - this album is awesome - Van Halen's \\"Different Kind of Truth\\" truly tears it up. Some songs are freakin' good and others are downright excellent!  You must be aware that some of those 90 second samples available before the album launched last week didn't do all the songs justice -- seriously buy the album and listen to it a few times -- you will soon agree that this album freakin' rocks!  Candidly, the original words of 'Down in Flames' (now Tattoo) and 'She's the Woman' are better than their remakes.  But the remakes themselves are still good.  Enjoy!

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I bought this unit 2+ years ago.  I am using it with a TV with a line output, that did not allow independent control of its volume.  I am not an audiophile but the unit has worked flawlessly.  I use the TV volume/mute for the TV speaker and the FIIO for the headset volume.  Though obviously intended for portable applications with a few tie wraps I was able to secure it firmly to a bedside table to provide a rigid socket for the headphones and allow easy one handed use of the push button volume controls.  No problems so far with it being charged 24/7 thought I don't know if this is recommended by the manufacturer.

B005LAIGRS|3.0|\\"Safe House\\" is an action thriller film. The narrative brings together Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who is a rookie CIA operative, and Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) a former CIA Agent who is accused of being a traitor.  Weston's deployment to South Africa has been uneventful for a year until Frost turns himself in to the U.S. embassy, following a narrow escape whilst collecting top secret information. What starts as an interrogation at the safe house becomes a shootout as an unidentified group attempt to capture Frost.  The story leaves the viewer for the most part trying to work out who are the good guys and the bad guys. Frost is presented as an enigma in terms of his actual allegiances, whilst young Weston is trying to make the right decisions amongst all the chaos.  This film is pure action genre with lots of shooting, explosions, and high speed car chases, yet it is part of a growing trend of works that are critical of intelligence agencies such as the movie \\"Rendition\\".  Reynolds and Washington both provide a vigorous and captivating screen presence in a story that isn't all that surprising, but is still quite entertaining.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game! great way to kill time. this game will keep you busy for a while even if some of the mini games are a little silly. yes, the ads are annoying but not that bad. highly recommend getting this game.
B006UG90RM|2.0|Update: As of July 1st - this album had only sold 395K copies. That is less than VH 3 and we all know how bad it was. Let's face it, after the first week or two of curiosity, and I was in that group, sales have fallen to nothing. Basically, this album stunk, and people ran from if after they heard a little sample.  Not even many die hard VH fans bought it, cause I know there are more than 395K out there.  Just saying.<br />Original review: Ok, I give it 2 stars - one for each one of the Van Halen brothers on this CD. I deducted a star for missing MA on background vocals and two stars for Dave's terrible performance.  The Van Halen brothers said it and we would not listen, but to have DLR on lead vocals would be an embarrassment for the band - and they were right. A chain is only as strong as the weakest link and Dave is for sure the weak link here.  Some songs are down right \\"un-listenable\\" due to the vocal - speak - or whatever Dave is trying to do on most of the songs. No way Roth pulls these songs off live - and there will be no need to since nobody is going to want to hear them live anyway. I'm a VH fan from the very start and I was really hoping for better. Musically, the disc is pretty solid even though it is scrambled, I just can't get past the vocals. First three songs show some promise and then things just turn into a train wreck.  The faster the pace of the song the worse Dave sounds trying to just get some kind of lyric out there, but there is no rhyme or harmony or hooks to make you want to sing along or even hear the song again. All the things that grate on my nerves about Dave's singing are here in abundance to the point of nausia.  \\"Women and Children First\\" is my favorite VH album and Dave adlibs all over the place - but it is cool and honest. This CD is full of forced attempts that come off like a bad Vegas act.  I never got into the Hagar years so this was my one shot at a VH come back. Oh, well I'm glad I have all the old stuff on CD.
B0062NAX1U|1.0|This must be one the the worst films I´ve come across so far this year. It goes from interesting, to cheesy, to worse, to a father marrying his own daughter. Religious doctrine at it´s finest...  The story becomes obvious after half an hour or so: believe in stupid things and you´ll end up OK.  Apparently job opportunities will come out of nowhere if you pray in the streets. This is supposed to be the will of god. When your daughter gets run over by a drunk driver and killed it is also supposed to be the will of god, only an unexplainable will, which somehow, somewhere, makes complete sense. Stupid, yes, but only if you look at it for what it really is. When you don´t, that´s when you rate this garbage 5 stars and it gets the rating it has.  I thought there was hope when one of the officers at a BBQ commented that \\"not everyone believes in these things\\", but of course he was dragged into the make believe after a two minute tear dripping conversation (hopefully thru the script, and not by personal conviction).  It wouldn´t surprise me if the sequel involves dinosaurs patrolling the streets side by side with the officers.
0525478817|5.0|I started out merely as a fan of John Green, the video blogger on the internet with his brother and so pined to get a hold of his books to read.  I live in Asia so it's not the easiest thing to go into a bookshop and finding whatever you want.  I finally found Looking For Alaska, loved it and recommended it to all my friends, I also enjoyed Will Grayson, Will Grayson (which he co wrote).  It was when he was promoting The fault in our stars last year, did I preorder my copy via Amazon online, since I wanted to support him in any way I could, I loved all his past writings, the first two chapter teasers and the first printings were all signed.  After a long wait for my shipping to arrive, the book got to my house safe and sound. I devoured the book in 5 and a half hours straight without a break.  (Oh and yes, my copy was gladly signed.)  This book is all kinds of wonderfulness mixed together. There's a bunch of witty comments and teenage sarcasm etc in it that will relate to \\"young adult\\" readers but the depth of the book and \\"smartness\\" of it allows readers who are no longer \\"young adults\\" to read it too and enjoy it.  Like all John Green books, you always learn and get something out of it (well for me), you learn to see the world in another person's perspective, experience things you'll never experience. You slowly fall in love with all the characters and it's just like you're living and breathing in the story.  Do not think of it as a \\"cancer story\\" it is but it's much more than that and ultimately after finishing the book, you walk away with so much.  And as John Green wished us to experience, yes I did feel \\"all the things\\".  DFTBA  (I'm sorry I'm not the best at reviewing things without being biased. DO give the book a try though, read the sample chapters)

B0054JELS4|3.0|This is a really good buy. I have a few discs that skip when you watch the episodes. I am still waiting til I completely watch all of the seasons before I let them know what is going on with my purchase. The quality of the disc is really good. I would recommend other people buying this product. They are good with shipping it to you. It was shipped to me earlier than what they told me it would take.
B00376AWHK|5.0|Amazing clarity!! The best this great classic has ever sounded, IMO. Thank you, Audio Fidelity!

B004EPZ07K|3.0|I should first say I don't know anything about the original Green Lantern story, so can't judge it from that perspective. Just judging it as a movie, it didn't measure up to the best superhero movies that have come out over the last few years - Spiderman and Ironman being my favorites, as well as The Dark Knight. These brought something different to the genre because of the complexity of the characters, their tortured depths, and how they were played by their respective actors. Unfortunately, although the writers tried to give some of that complexity to Green Lantern, it just didn't come through well. So many scenes are cliche, and neither Ryan Reynolds or Blake Lively manage to bring much emotional depth through. And their chemistry was not great either.<br /><br />The story, in terms of the alien race that is the source of Green Lantern's power, and the 'guardian' role they play is interesting, as is the idea of 'will' and 'fear' as forces in the universe that they can harness. However, the training scenes seemed like a combination of Star Wars and Karate Kid, but weren't done as well as either. The special effects were good - I especially enjoyed the guardian flying sequences - but not enough to entirely save the film for me.<br /><br />So overall, mildly entertaining, but a bit cliche and wooden - not the stuff of a new hit series of movies, I think.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|There are better, brighter and smarter music reviewers who's reviews you should read for facts. This review is written from my heart.<br /><br />I've been in love with the Cute Beatle since he first opened up his mouth. Through every reincarnation and spouse, I've followed his evolution as a musician. When I first heard of this album, I rushed to download it, not caring a wit about giving it a preview beforehand. I am NOT disappointed.<br /><br />For anyone who's a Prairie Home Companion Fan or been to the Green Mill in Chicago, listening to this album is akin to having Paul sing directly to you, while you've either got the radio right next to you or you're at a small bistro table gazing into his eyes at a small venue. Realizing that Paul's now 69 years of age, I can excuse any and all small diminishing of his vocal ability; heck, I'm 10 years younger and can't do squat of what I did in my youth!<br /><br />The back up musicians are playing their A-Game from a Peter Ostroushko accompaniment on \\"It's Only a Paper Moon\\" to the wonderful cello playing on \\"The Glory of Love\\". And, like Paul, I grew up listening to 1920-1950's music, courtesy of being raised by my Grandparents so I \\"get and respect\\" him honouring his roots. Bearing in mind that we've just lost the great Whitney Houston and we're losing Glen Campbell through Alzheimer's, having Paul still rock it out is a blessing to his fans.<br /><br />I downloaded this album two days ago and haven't taken it off rotation since. So, thank you, Sir Paul...with love.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|My husband picked this one, and I wasn't all that keen on seeing it, as I wasn't a huge fan of Hangover. For whatever reason (better wine?) I actually enjoyed this one a little more, I think because of the Thailand setting. Personally I could use a little more Bradley Cooper and less Zach Galifianakis, but that may just be me:-) In this one, Ed Helms is getting married in Thailand - his wife's family is from there - at a lovely beachside resort. Although not planning to party, through a mysterious set of circumstances (which we later learn of) a beachside beer turns into a complete blackout night, with Helms/Cooper/Galifiankis's characters waking up in Bangkok in a dreadful state, and missing the bride's 15-year old brother (whose finger appears to be in an ice bucket next to him.) So sets the stage for the movie. They set out to find him, and get back to the resort in time for the wedding, and in the process start to remember and retrace the events of the night before.<br /><br />Plenty of funny moments ensue - dark humor of course. I think everyone plays their parts well, and it's a solid sequel, good for some laughs. If you hated the first one, this one probably won't win you over, but if you enjoyed the first even mildly (as I did) then you will probably get some laughs from this.

I've never been a \\"SUPER-HUGE\\" Van Halen fan (I believe I bought maybe 3 Roth era's & 1 Hagar), but come on!!! You 1 star people all must either be deaf... dead or bitter.  I mean really!  Oh well... I'm not going to go into a major debate or review here... There's enough of those already.  All I know is it makes me smile & feel younger (and seems to have had the same effect on everyone I've played it for so far) that in itself warrants my 5 Star review (In other words... YES! It Kicks royal Ass!!!)  As I said... Sad some just don't hear it that way.  I totally respect that...I'm just glad I do!  Need I say more?

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I saw previews for this movie when it was still in theaters and didn't know what to make of it. The title and darkness enticed me the most. \\"Drive\\" is a simple and to the point word in itself, just as the main character is. Simplicity and complexity blend perfectly here, because the main character, only known as \\"Driver\\" is a near mute character. All ratings here that gave 5 stars would agree that the stylistic approach, (with an electronica undertone for a soundtrack) only add to the stamina of this film. This is a movie for book lovers, because much of it is subjective and makes you think. There are many scenes in which conversation seems like it would intercede, but instead is unspoken and causes the audience to think about the emotions portrayed before your eyes. It is rather brooding, but is done tastefully. I'll admit, it was hard watching Albert Brookes play a villian when I'm used to his comedic roles, but he too does a fantastic job as a straight-to-the-point kind of guy who shows no mercy or sympathy. For Gosling's character, I felt a sympathetic feeling for him. His loner lifestyle is suddenly (if only momentarily) brightened by his neighbor and her young son. If you look closely, the cinematography with Carey Mulligan, her son and Gosling are light in nature which shows the mood of \\"Driver\\" during those moments. They are joyous moments for him. In other moments with his unrelenting behavior, the cinemetography grows dark.<br /><br />Yes, the title may seem misleading, but I found it to be quite the contrary. \\"Drive\\" seems to exude an unusual ride, and that's exactly what the film delivers. A must see for anyone who can truly appreciate it. I don't write reviews either, but felt compelled after watching it twice this past weekend. I loved this movie!

B004LP3AYI|2.0|In this day and age, it is not really necessary to purchase e-books.  I could for instance go to any number of websites and download them for free.  But that is piracy, and I don't generally support that.  Furthermore, the pirated versions generally have chunks missing and grammatical/formatting errors.  I assumed that since I purchased an officially distributed e-book, I would not have these problems.  I have previously purchased Wizard's First Rule, and did not notice any problems within that one.  Stone of Tears however, is full of grammer/spelling errors, and I have only read a few chapters so far.  This is poor quality even among what I have seen of pirated/scanned versions  There is another issue I had that may not matter to most people.  As with most books, the hard copies of the Sword of truth books start each chapter on a fresh page.  There was also a sword of truth logo at the start of each chapter, and a smaller one for certain breaks in the story.  I was happy to see that they kept this format in the e-book of Wizard's First Rule that I purchased from Amazon.  They did not for Stone of Tears.  I do not necessarily have a problem with the format itself, though it does cheapen it, but rather the fact that the formats between e-books of the same series is varied.  Wizard's First Rule cost me $4.99 and I was very happy.  Stone of Tears cost me $8.54 and I feel scammed.

B00664AM5C|4.0|I recently bought Contagion on blu-ray. Finally after getting the chance to watch it a day later, I decided to write this review while still fresh in my mind.  Contagion very vaguely reminds me of the 1996 medical thriller Outbreak. However, Contagion managed to do something Outbreak never did for me--giving me a nice feeling of suspenseful \\"what's going to happen next\\" dread kind of feeling. I will admit though not really a \\"scary\\" movie, the way everything was portrayed I found more frightening.  Comparisons aside, Contagion is a medical thriller ensemble movie starring Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Late Winslet, Matt Damon and featuring the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow. As such, the movie lacks a true central character or storyline. Instead it focuses on three: Laurence Fisburne plays Dr. Leonora Orantes, a CDC worker, Matt Damon as Mitch Ernoff, the husband of Gwynteth Paltrow's character (who is \\"patient zero\\"), and Jude Law as a conspiracy-minded self-serving blogger.  Of the three, I enjoyed the storyline following Matt Damon's character and his daughter the most followed by Laurence Fishburne's. Truthfully I didn't care much for Jude Law's storyline. It wasn't really that it was bad or anything, I just felt it more slowed the movie down than anything. I rather would have had more focus on the medical teams trying to come up with a vaccine, Mitch and his daughter surviving as social order began breaking down around them, or even what Kate Winslet's character did while virtually held hostage in the Chinese village.  The movie follows the respective characters as they continue trying to live and work as everything begins breaking down and panic, rioting, and looting begins to break out across the United States. I thought Contagion did a great job showing the fear among the public and giving off a sense of dread.  The acting was well done and the quality on my HDTV was great so no complaints there. One of the only real complaints I had with the movie was \\"Mitch's\\" reaction to his wife's and six year old son's deaths. One would expect that having two loved ones die so closely with each other, much less one of which is your child, to have a huge impact on you. Instead, other than a scene or two of anger and crying (not even hard crying) he seemed to take their deaths....rather exceedingly well, actually. Just something I noticed.  I think one thing that makes this movie as creepy as it is (if such a word can be used here) is that this is the kind of movie that can actually happen exactly as shown. You don't expect to look out the window one morning to see zombies marching towards your home or a masked serial killer chasing you. But a global pandemic killing millions not only CAN happen but HAS and could very well happen AGAIN.  Don't forget to wash your hands.
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|I played this game on my Kindle Fire and loved it.  The gameplay is challenging and fun and the graphics are great.  The one problem I had was the game tended to restart if I left it to use the device for anything else, losing any progress I had in the level.  This was only really an issue for the 20 round bonus mode.

0142004413|5.0|I have learned about Gerald Durrell later than many readers and animal lovers.  I am so thankful that I did hear about him.  I just finished reading and laughing through his book, My Family and Other Animals. Let me start by saying that my home is filled with animals.  Currently, we share out house with two dogs and two cats, but at times we have also hosted frogs, guinea pigs, and rabbits.  Our back yard is often visited by red foxes, beavers, raccoons, and deer.<br />I tell you this about myself because I detect a kindred spirit in the young Gerald as he recounts his adventures in Corfu where he amasses an impressive collection of pets.  Durrell's genius lies in his ability to make readers feel they know the members of his families as well as the personalities of the animals he encounters.  In addition, his writing is so beautifully descriptive without becoming cumbersome.<br />I heartily recommend this book to observers of animals and families.  It is highly entertaining and I plan to read whatever else he has written.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|This story told through the voice of the five-year-old who is born in the \\"Room\\" two years after his mother was kidnapped at nineteen and keep in a locked shed with only a skylight to let in light. The mother, he calls her Ma (why not Mom, I wonder) protects him to the best of her ability and has him hide in a closet when the abductor, they call \\"Old Nick\\" comes to visit his mother at night or at other times to bring food, etc. They have a TV so he does see images of the outside world but they hold little meaning for him. His world is \\"Room\\" and Ma. Although it seems odd that she was still nursing the child, I admired her for it as I know he was better nourished and the comfort of nursing was so important. She was losing her teeth and often in pain from her rotting teeth, a definite sacrifice for nursing draws nutrients from the mother, or so I understand. Eventually they trick Old Nick and the boy escapes and the authorities soon rescue Ma and capture Old Nick.  The rest of the story is concerned with their rehabilitation into the real world.  It's an interesting story, but to me better told through the mother's eyes. For me it was hard to stay interested with everything told in the child's voice.  But the child's voice did lend a unique quality to the story.  Eunice Boeve, author of Ride a Shadowed Trail
B0013LPS6Q|4.0|Suddenly, I find myself reviewing classic releases from the world's most universally recognizable band, having run through every other CD in my collection but the three I'll be consecutively reviewing for U2, and today it's their debut, \\"Boy\\".  Most of the lyrical content the band showcased after \\"Boy\\" centered around  the significance of the place in the universe that man should inhabit with regard to commitment to justice, spiritual enlightenment, and the importance of connections forged on a personal level, but it seems to me that \\"Boy\\" `s focus revolves around the terrifically magical universe of childhood with all of its novelty, cruelty,  exhilaration, loss, and inevitable ascent into a new level of hormonally-driven maturity , and the manner, positive or negative, in which it shapes entry into adulthood. And for every member of U2 at the time that \\"Boy\\" was recorded, there was no such thing as a tenuous connection to it; the oldest member of the band was 20, and it was something still very much captive in recent memory, only a couple of years removed from adolescence. Just look at the titles of some tracks for confirmation; \\"A Day Without Me\\", \\"Out Of Control\\", \\"Stories For Boys\\" , \\"Into The Heart\\", \\"Shadows And Tall Trees\\" , and \\"I Will Follow\\".  Raw and churning and aggressive, textural, haunting and atmospheric, intense, offbeat, and impatient, animated by harmonics rather than any sort of conventional style, Dave (Edge) Evans' guitar work provides a counterpoint for Bono's impassioned delivery of those lyrics, the singer formerly known as Paul Hewson not quite yet in the mature level of his vocal range, and indeed, its universal expanse (in my opinion, at least) wasn't fully developed until \\"War\\". A level, rhythmic insistence developed by Adam Clayton's elementary basslines and Larry Mullen, Jr's percussive flourishes provide steady footing for the distinctive, expressive style both The Edge and Bono were honing even then.  Marking a positive transition into a signed band whose recordings were getting label distribution, U2 presented with a sound already containing some of their signature elements later to make them universally recognizable upon first listen (specifically Edge's subtle, atmospheric, textural , heavily-processed guitar work and Bono's expressive,  charismatic vocal delivery) integrated into tracks that in large part made up for what they lack in technical polish (and in some cases, conventional structure) with remarkable enthusiasm, and a significantly elevated level of intensity. Of all the cuts, only \\"\\"Another Time, Another Place\\" and \\"Twilight\\" ( which I suspect I'll take some heat for) don't really work for me; otherwise, this was a strongly impressive debut, and I can recommend it without hesitation.

0307949486|4.0|This book was a gift. So when I deserved to quit reading after the first 100 boring (unnecessary) pages, I felt obligated to stick it out for the remaining 500+. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />By the book's end, I agreed with all the other reviewers who really liked this book. The plot was interesting, the pacing (finally, beginning at about the 250 page mark) was excellent, and the writing was mostly clean. I found myself wanting to return to the book a couple days after finishing. That's a good sign.<br /><br />Still, some parts of it were definitely annoying. Like the fact that SO many characters' last names started with B! After awhile, they were hard to keep straight. What's up with that? Also, the lazy use of cliches (\\"dead as a doornail\\" more than once), and the gratuitous use of disturbing violence. In particular, a long scene with Salander that could have been written better and less graphically, yet still retained its impact. Also, Larsson broke the cardinal writing rule of \\"show, don't tell\\" when he introduced his characters, describing them for pages (especially Salander) with exactly how he wanted us to view them, rather than letting us make up our minds based on their actions. He so much wanted us to be impressed with Salander's quirks - going overboard to highlight her tattoos and piercings (not really a big deal nowadays) - that I found myself totally unimpressed and not liking her at all. It wasn't until about 2/3 through the book that I actually did like her, and then I liked her a lot. Larsson is a good writer, but the book deserved and needed better editing.<br /><br />The writing quality was inconsistent. Some parts were written flawlessly, while others read like an unedited first draft.<br /><br />Finally, the book contained two excellent plots. It only needed one, as they didn't tie together at all, except for a failed, half-hearted attempt that went nowhere. Removing the lesser plot would have shortened the book, tightened the pacing and improved the entire manuscript.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|This was by far, most certainly, without a doubt.. the first book I put on my Kindle over two years ago. And I can't count the number of times I've read it since then! Jane Austen is a wonderful writer... Lizzy is an amazing character to follow and fall in love with. Mr. Darcy... so dark and mysterious and stern. I love reading about the social and societal customs and ideals... it's so very interesting, so different from life today. No matter what mood I'm in, I can flip to Pride and Prejudice and feel warm, cozy, and content within minutes. Favorite book of all time. Weeeell.. Pride and Prejudice is in direct competition with Harry Potter.. for the spot of 'favorite book of all time.' But it's definitely right up there. You can't go wrong - read this book!!

075695195X|5.0|Great series for young and old alike! Stroud is able to bring to life this unique world of wizards and demons/spirits. Bartimaeus was surprisingly very witty and sarcastic - a refreshing narrator (with entertaining footnotes!). Stands well on its own separate from Harry Potter.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I think that Dan Brown is not a good writer, but he knows how to entertain those where my thoughts when I finished reading the Davinci Code and Angels and Demons, but this book is ridiculous, is the same structure of the other two but without a good theme.  The more you read the more pathethic the book became, the end is a disaster, he could go deep in the Malhak character and learn about his motivations, how he became a monster,  but Brown decides that its better for the plot to unveil  the secret of the Washington obelisk .... So much trouble for a bible ...... This doesn't make any sense at all.  If you like to read a good novel, skip this, this novel is a disaster, this is Brown´s Waterloo
B001QGRIO8|2.0|I was expecting a nice book, this not only had no cover but was also written in. Yes I knew it was used... but they misled me.. Not happy I gave it to goodwill and went and bought brand new for what I paid for this one...
1419702238|1.0|Sorry I could not find any redeeming value in the book. I could try to justify it given all the best-seller status, Hollywood movie, getting kids reading arguments, but the evidence just isn't there.  The problem with this series is that it fails on so many levels. It offers a flat story line and no real vocabulary. Language and grammar fail because, of course, it's a 6th grader's diary. Those things could be forgiven, because, of course, it's a 6th grader's diary, if only it were funny! It is not funny or clever. (I think my daughter and I smirked twice.) The pictures are ugly (yes, I know, it's a 6th grader's diary).  But the worst part is serious: Greg is a lousy, dishonest friend. He mishandles his Safety Patrol responsibilities and lets his friend Rowley take the blame. Throughout the rest of the book he remains oblivious to his greed and selfishness, never tells the truth about the situation, and never apologizes. Greg makes a small sacrifice for Rowley at the end, but by that time it seemed too little, too late to actually be considered redeeming. He just wasn't the kind of role model my kids need. Naturally, a book of this type can also be predicted to stereotype parents. As you might guess, the dad is clueless and the mom alternates between nag and embarrassment.<br /><br />What's a parent to do? another-story4u.blogspot.com for details.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This book and the whole series for that matter is simply amazing. You will not be able to put this down. It is filled with so much love, lust,and passion. I was very upset when I was finished with the series. She needs to write more books! You will not be disappointed! I highly recommend this series!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|The premise of the game is fairly simple, but as with all the best games it introduces more gameplay styles and gets more challenging as you go. Overall it's an enjoyable game.
B006UG90RM|2.0|I'm seeing all these 5 start reviews and I'm just flabbergasted.  Is it because its been so long since a new VH album? I'm not trolling these reviews, I've followed VH through thick and thin, lead singer after lead singer, I am a SUPERFAN. I Listen to them everyday and this album just doesn't cut the mustard. There are better tracks on the VH III album. You read that right. I sat down and listened to this album for hours looking for something, something that would bring me back to the DLR days, or anything that would spark that fire. It's just not there, of course this is my opinion and I'll quote someone from another VH album review \\" This is a good album if you are not a VH fan\\". 15 year old studio tracks does not a good album make.  Ted Templeman, if you are reading this, I've got a beer with your name on it. It's about 10% tears as I have been crying into it since Feb 7th.
B004RPRM46|5.0|I listened to these CDs on my way to work three times.  Love them!  So much wisdom!!  I need to go back once more without the distraction of driving and take notes so that these principles can become a part of my everyday life.  Thank you!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is great because there are many versions of the Bible to choose from, and plenty of ways to read through the Bible. reading plans are even available.  you can highlight and make notes in the text. I like being able to read a few chapters at a time and opening the app the next day in the same place where I left off.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game, by far, is one of the best tablet games out there. Both fun and thought provoking, it's well worth a couple bucks.
0451191153|5.0|Haven't read it yet but the book is like new and arrived ahead of schedule. Couldn't ask for much better than that!
B006NFKUF6|5.0|I loved it. I cant wait until I get the full version. I want it so bad I would even buy it if it were 100$.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It runs perfectly on the kindle fire with or without wifi. Its easy to use and takes up a fraction of memory. Get it try it you won't regret it.
B00192IV0O|5.0|Awsome songs on this album.  Now I'm a fan of this group.  I would suggest if anyone is the NOW GENERATION and you want great tunes to rock, this is the album!
B004I744AS|4.0|I use this app almost every day. I like the word of the day and how searches incorporate multiple languages.
0671510991|5.0|Diplomacy remains probably the best work on International Relations for people who are new to the subject, but interested in it. A majestic sweep, piercing insights and  easy reading don't usually go hand in hand. But Dr. Kissinger seems to have achieved this feat.  Highly recommended.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|This movie is great!  Michael Moore hits it right on the money with his understanding and portrayal of the banking and wall street industries.  Everyone should watch this movie to realize what is happening to us.
B006UG909U|2.0|This is pretty weak considering how great these guys were back in the late 70s early 80s. I was so looking forward to a good album out of them and am very disappointed. The only good song on it is the one they play on Youtube. This sounds like outtakes from one of their albums back in the day. Weak, repetitive drum work. Same old guitar riffs and leads he's been playing for years. The vocals were good but the lyrics on this album are weak. The only good part of it is Wolfgang's bass playing. He's very good and has a style all his own.<br /><br />Wolfgang needs to find a new band. This one is washed up.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|Needs to be updated, does not work on galaxy nexus or tablets (rotation is messed up, makes app unusable). Version on android market fixes these issues
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a fun game. I really loved the graphics! The map was needed so you could get around without to much trouble. Can't. wait for the next game.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a fun app.  Similar to \\"Cut the Rope\\".  My son and niece love it.  I got it for free today but 99 cents worths it.
B006PHD0RW|2.0|You people all spend time and money bagging fake groceries on your phone, but not lift a finger at the grocery store. Bag your own groceries at the checkout counter and see how &quot;fun&quot; it really is. Maybe, just maybe, your cashier might not hate you (as much).
0307387178|2.0|Basically, at this point I'm looking forward to the part where McCandless dies a miserable death because when you get right down to it, the guy was a douche. Krakauer does an admirable job of trying to explain why this dumbass did what he did, but underneath it all it's basically a story about a spoiled naive rich kid who was too stupid or too arrogant to plan properly for the task he undertook. Can't wait to reach the end of this book, because it'll be a good laugh, and who couldn't use a good laugh these days?
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I enjoyed this app for a while but then Got VERY boring. Trust me on this my opinion doesn't mean much, but if you want a great game that's fun forever I recommend Temple Run for the ipod touch ipad and iphone.I love apple profits. Oh and its not an extremely terrible app.
B0071QIN00|5.0|please make more levels soon, anyone who complains about the game play just sucks at games or has a crappy phone or tablet. amazon app store let's any device download any app so people with outdated devices get this app and give it bad reviews when it doesn't work properly.
B006VRZ5YM|4.0|It was a good movie.  Not horribly unbearable but like any other romantic comedy currently out.  Worth a few bucks to watch but nothing I would buy.
B002BWP49C|4.0|I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT IF I COULD GET IT. SO I COULD WATCH IT. ITS SUPPOSE TO BE HERE BY THURSDAY. ITS SHOWING ITS NOT SHIPPED YET. AND TODAY IS TUESDAY. PLEASE HURRY UP AND SEND MY ORDER. I COULD HAVE BOUGHT IT AT WALMART IF I KNOWED IT WAS GONNA TAKE LONGER THAN WHAT IT SAID.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|AMAZING!  Best movie to come out in a really long time.  Definitely looking forward to the sequel!!!  Must buy movie of the year!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|game has a lot of fun aspects. works well on kindle fire too. glad I can keep playing over and over.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think this is a great game cuz u can change the card's and the background. also because you can change the type of game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has such a verity of different activities and become addictive but never boring! ive enjoyed it a lot and it has saved me from many boring occations.
B00003CX8N|2.0|This movie does have a moral:  don't put things off.  But, is there any real purpose in reiterating this ages-old adage in a humdrum modern fable that is otherwise pointless, plodding, and even intellectually grating?  At least three talented performers are wasted in the effort.  Anthony Hopkins and Judy Dench are bound by one-dimensional roles that could have conceivably been carried off by non-actors.  Dench's portrayal is proppish and abbreviated, and Hopkins is little more than a foil for the whimsical trans-Atlantic book orders dispatched by Anne Bancroft's character--an aging, eccentric New York spinster who is annoyingly pollyannaish and schmaltzily flip.  There is nothing romantic in her interchange of missives with Hopkins, as any prospective viewer might assume.  She orders classics from London because she can't be bothered to travel several blocks to bookstores or libraries in Gotham (which should have been a book lover's paradise). She engages in childish tantrums--like throwing an imperfect volume against the wall--and fires off sarcastic condemnations of Hopkins's sincere efforts to fill her exacting orders.  Yet, costly, protracted dentalwork, unwarranted arrest, and unexpected eviction scarcely faze her.  If she succumbs to a few moments of real human emotion, she then promptly reassumes her plastic smile and goes skipping along like an over-the-hill That Girl.  The movie itself just keeps going downhill--slowly, tediously, wincingly.  Books are ordered and received.  Gifts of food are ordered and received.  Newsy notes are posted and read.  The years--and the story--drag on.  And, in the end, nothing that Bancroft's character does ever really matters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game very entertaining for everyone hours of fun for the whole family even the preschooler in the home. recommend for everyone who loves games. .
B0078JOAOI|5.0|\\"Nebraska\\" is the first episode in the second half of Season 2 of the AMC TV show \\"The Walking Dead\\".<br /><br />Another terrific episode in this outstanding series in which the survivors deal with the aftermath of the 'barn' incident, Hershel's disappearance and Laura's car drive.<br /><br />Impressions...<br /><br />Some complain about the lack of action, but this episode (and the others in Season 2) are more than just encounters with Zombies (although there are plenty of those). What makes this show so special (at least to me) is...<br /><br />1.) the acting...and not just by one or two. The entire cast is great.<br /><br />2.) the method in which the plot is slowly advanced to build a tension filled atmosphere that usually leads to one or more focal points in each episode.<br /><br />3.) the different personalities that make up the survivor group... a fragile mix of emotions that are liable to explode at any moment and often do.<br /><br />4.) new developments are brought into play just as one flash point is finally put to rest, resulting in another tense, edgy ending for this particular show. You could just feel it coming... loved it!<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A Zombie TV adventure with as good as acting and plot writing as your ever likely to encounter.<br /><br />5 Stars<br /><br />Ray Nicholson
1451648537|5.0|This was quite a book and very interesting. Steve Jobs was not a man you wanted to show sub par work to.  He would tell you straight up how bad it was, yet at the same time you would feel inspired to do the best work you could to impress him the next time.<br />This book is about Steve Jobs, who he was, what he did and who he became.  Isaacson interviews many different people in Jobs life and make a clear picture of who Jobs was and how he conducted business.  This book is a great timeline of his life and it was neatly written.  It is also not one sided, stating that he was the best/greatest/nicest..etc that there is, but rather that he was a man who could control a room and could influence the best of people on \\"walks\\".<br />The background information about Jobs was wonderful and as you get closer to the story of Apple as we know it today the book begins to pick up some steam.  Jobs always wanted to create amazing products for customers before they realized that they wanted/needed it.<br />I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Apple, in the iPod/iPad/iPhone/iMac/iCloud, and to people who love technology. Only warning, it is a long book that will take some time to get through. Other than that ENJOY!
1466208686|5.0|I must say this book proved to be indispensable for my preparation.

142311339X|5.0|This is a great book. Even though Percy is not in this book, Jason is still as easy to fall in love with. This book keeps you reading until the last page and until you read \\"The Son of Neptune\\". This is an awesome series to start reading.

1423136802|5.0|The series is really good. I never put the books down until I finished the series. I even went on to read Heroes of Olympus and those books are great to. I can't wait until book three of the series. Percy Jackson is a great character to fall in love with.

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|There's a moment in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (TGWTDT) where hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) seems to ask disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) for permission to commit murder.  That simple phrase sums up the perfect synchronicity of David Fincher's direction, Steven Zaillian's screenplay, and Trent Reznor's score. What kind of a woman asks for permission to kill?<br /><br />By now the plot of TGWTDT is well-known: When Blomkvsit, co-owner of Millennium magazine loses his libel case against corrupt CEO Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg), he is given an opportunity at redemption and revenge by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). It's a good old fashioned murder mystery; Vanger is obsessed with solving the murder of his grandniece Harriet (Moa Garpendal).  And so, slinking out of the public eye, Blomkvist takes the job and moves onto the family's private island.<br /><br />Running parallel to Blomkvist's investigation is the tale of Salander. She is a product of the Swedish system, a ward of the state and abused product of the foster system. It doesn't take long before it becomes clear that Lisbeth is as much a ward as a victim; disaffected, detached, practical, and yes violent, she does what any man would do when facing abuse - she punches it in the face.  But because Lisbeth is a thin, pale girl with piercings all over her body, she is demonized and ostracized.  Lisbeth's greatest nemesis is Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), a corpulent, corrupt lawyer who manipulates Lisbeth into performing certain favors on him. And if you know Lisbeth you know this won't end well.<br /><br />Eventually these two plotlines converge.  Lisbeth provides much needed technical wizardry to Blomkvist's old school investigation. They are united by the opportunity to stop a \\"killer of women,\\" a foe Lisbeth can certainly relate to.<br /><br />The crux of TGWTDT is the story of Lisbeth, of Harriet, of all the women who are routinely intimidated and subjugated by men who wield their power without restraint.  Their victims are merely foils, projections for each man's sins, and Lisbeth can't resist the opportunity to help a ghost from 40 years past get redemption.<br /><br />But back to that question.  It means so many things.  On one level, Lisbeth is still asking permission from men.  On the other, she doesn't need to ask anyone for permission for anything.  Lisbeth is certainly the most dangerous predator in the entire film. So why did she ask Blomkvist the question?<br /><br />I like to think it was a sign of affection, in the way a lover might ask, \\"Can I get you something to drink?\\" Or maybe it's a turn-taking request: \\"Were you planning on torturing him?\\" in the same way you might ask \\"Would you like to go first?\\" Mara's nuanced performance makes all the difference, and the fact that simple phrase can cause so much controversy is just one example of why The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an excellent film.straint.

B000O8OTNC|1.0|It's great for the first knife that you sharpen, but it becomes a useless piece for the second.  I bought 2 Ka-bars when I got this sharpener.  I sharpened one to the point it would shave and then I started on the other.  Unfortunately, the sharpener must have already been spent.  It took away from the factory edge that the blade came with.  I've used generic kitchen sharpeners for years and have had no problems, but this tool took a fine edge and made it dull.  I'm not sure if this is a one use tool or not, but that is what it did for me.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|The imperfections of this book only help make it perfect. Enzo, the dog narrator, tells the story of what happens when his master Denny has to deal with the eventual loss of his wife due to cancer and the horrible custody battle that ensues with his daughter's grandparents. Along the way, Enzo applies zen-like wisdom to the lessons he learns about life. Many of those lessons result from watching videos on racecar driving with Denny. Garth Stein is not going for a realistic dog's point of view. This story utterly captures the way that humans tend to put their thoughts and emotions into a relationship with a pet. We all could learn a lot by appreciating the human-dog bond and applying its lessons to other areas of our lives.<br /><br />[...]
0375701427|1.0|An entire book dedicated to character building, and setting up the plot, only to have a deflated ending. Philip Roth goes through in excruciating detail about the Swede's childhood, and upbringing. Then he moves on to talk about his family, his work, and his troubles with his lost daughter. Throughout the whole book, it seemed like Philip was building up to a spectacular finale. However, the story instead ends abruptly with no real conclusion. I felt cheated. Where's the rest of the story?
0812550757|5.0|Like Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead is a very thought-provoking story.  It takes place on a Brazilian colony world called Lusitania.  Unique to this world is the presence of another intelligent race called the Pequeninos.  They are the first intelligent alien species discovered since the Formics.  The culture and life cycle of the Pequeninos is significantly different from our own.  As we try to learn about them, their cultural and evolutionary differences cause many difficulties, especially after two xenologers are found vivisected.  The Pequeninos are not the only strange thing about this world.  There's a plague called the Descolada that causes DNA to disassemble, and leads to other unusual biology on the planet.<br />Andrew Wiggin is still alive thanks to relativity due to the amount of time he's spent in space travel.  He is called to Lusitania to speak the death of the first xenologer.  It takes 22 years for him to get there, but he ages less than two weeks (due to traveling at near lightspeed).  However, in this time, the original call had been cancelled, but the former caller's children have called him to speak the death of their father.  From here, the story begins to really develop.<br />The book moves along well, and it keeps your mind trying to piece things together along with the characters in the book.  It provides many new ways of thinking that are fun to explore in your mind.<br />That's all I will say for now.  Afterall, if I told you everything, you'd have no reason to read the book.  Just one warning: the end kind of does leave you hanging, so you'll have to read the sequel.
0393330435|3.0|So this is what it takes to be a genius: aloof, arrogant, selfish, passionate, driven, a loner, and childish. This is my impression of Steve Wozniak. His writing style is a bit child like, with his simple sentences, and simple words. A tad annoying to read, but an interesting read nonetheless. The book gives a rare insight into how a start up company is created, and what it takes to create something that changes the world.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a fantastic app.  You can switch between translations, put yourself on a reading plan, highlight and bookmark scriptures, and jump back and forth between books without losing your place. I find it particularly useful when studying the Old Testament, as I can read the Orthodox Jewish Version and get more accurate understanding with its use of Hebrew words (written phonetically).  There are so many translations available, and this app is so easy to use, it has become my all-time favorite.

B002CRJWV2|5.0|There are a few CD sets compilating the four orchestral suites by Tchaikovsky.  The best known are Svetlanov`s, Järvi`s (a pity that MTT never completed his set  with the Philharmonia), and finally and of course, this one masterly performed  by Antal Dorati and now reissued by Decca (originally from Philips Duo edition).  The hungarian Maestro was a great Tchaikovsky performer, as we can appreciate in  his great symphony cycle for Mercury and now in those albums. The suites are  beautifully played and scores are perfectly judged and balanced by Dorati, who  manages his baton skilfully and masterly. This is an essential album for every  Tchaikovsky lover and collector and so i recommend it.

B004EBT5CU|3.0|It is not acceptable for the stinking record company to auto run software that then starts playing the music on their own player when the disk is inserted in a machine. They may think they are being clever and cool but they don't get to drive my PC any more than they get to drive my car. Sony used to do this and they loaded a root kit that hid files from users and allowed malware to conceal itself. NOT COOL. I'd say what I really think of these people but the profanity filter would block it.

B006W0QOF2|4.0|This movie was out of control. It was nothing like I expected and I mean that in a good way. I was pretty high when I watched it so it was kind of hard to follow the plot but I was very entertained. The ultra violence freaked me out a bit, but that's OK too. Is he some kind of autistic guardian angel?  I'm convinced that they didn't shoot enough footage of Ryan Gosling. Maybe he had to fun off to shoot Ides of March or something. So, they created a reason for his character to wear that mask. Then the used slow-mo in many scenes to extend the existing footage.  4/5 because they didn't utilized Christina Henrick's boobage to a great enough degree. Also, clean
184311917X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo20UL2CDJR8WVV]]<br />TO CONSTRUCTION LAW IN ENGLAND, WALES AND AUSTRALIA<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The construction industry has always involved the expenditure of mighty sums, often over far-reaching geographical areas, within lengthy time frames. Construction has always been a global industry and is becoming even more so by the day.<br /><br />How useful then, if you are a construction lawyer, to have a clear, detailed and authoritative work of legal reference which not only covers construction law in England and Wales, but provides a comparative study with Australian construction law.<br /><br />Is such a comparison, however, of primary, or merely of secondary importance? If you are, say, a construction lawyer in England and Wales, should you make a point of familiarizing yourself with legal issues which have emerged within the construction industry in Australia? The short answer is `yes,' particularly if your clients' business is global.<br /><br />As author Julian Bailey reminds us, `the common law was exported throughout the British Empire, so that judge-made law, as developed by the English Courts, took root in parts of the Empire including Australia and the many other nations which constituted the Empire.'<br /><br />He adds that a body of law has therefore developed from the various common law countries concerning issues which have direct bearing on construction and engineering projects wherever they are based. Court decisions in construction and engineering cases are regularly made in England on points of law not considered in Australia and vice versa, he points out.<br /><br />It's therefore often helpful, he says, to keep a watchful eye on developments in both jurisdictions, so as to give an indication of how particular legal issues may be, or are likely to be resolved.<br /><br />One example of such an issue is the problem of the legal identity of a company and whether the identity of parent company and its subsidiaries is distinct. There are occasions, warns Bailey, 'when the \\"corporate veil\\" will be pierced so that a parent company may be held liable for the conduct of its subsidiary, or may recover a loss suffered by its subsidiary.' These points and related matters are discussed in detail typical of the author's clear, penetrating, insightful and thorough approach.<br /><br />The result is a meticulously footnoted three volume work of reference logically laid out, readable and easy to use, The index at the back of each volume umbers on average, over 60 pages and there is of course, a full and detailed table of contents, Research resources abound, including at least 200 pages in the first volume alone, of tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments.<br /><br />Lord Justice Jackson, in the Foreword, calls this three volume work a `tour-de-force' and we cannot but agree. The work takes a thorough, scholarly, yet readable and practical approach to an extremely wide ranging, dynamic and continually changing area of law. We believe it will be welcomed by practitioners, or any other parties dealing with legal issues emanating from construction and engineering projects, particularly in common law countries. The law is stated as at April 2011.occasions, warns Bailey, 'when the \\"corporate veil\\" will be pierced so that a parent company may be held liable for the conduct of its subsidiary, or may recover a loss suffered by its subsidiary.'

Thoughtful premise and okay acting plus imaginative ends for those involved gave the movies a foot up on the usual slasher garbage. Then along comes this one. Boy were we excited! Too late we realised someone really needed money. They destroyed what had been a good run for some better than average teen slasher/silly fare. I KNOW...foolish of me even for a minute to hope that anyone in hollywood has a smidge of integrity remaining but hope for mankind never dies I suppose. I have a sour taste for my Final collection but hopefully, with time and a shrink, I will someday again enjoy the other 4 films. What rotters! Can nobody quit while they retain a shred of dignity?

The authors, Feetham and Amos, both Gibraltar-based and practising internationally, have aimed to bring their wealth of experience to the examination of insurance law as an issue of governance, governance most commonly being the preserve of international accounting firms through their consultancy arms.<br /><br />Author Nigel Feetham has, in his words, attempted to bring the practice of insurance law closer to the study of governance, as well as providing a guide `to current trends, markets and policy choices facing governments and regulators'.<br /><br />It's hoped that the book will provide valuable insights into the changing regulatory environment which informs and drives insurance, as well as `an understanding of the challenges facing insurance companies' both domestic and international.<br /><br />The catalyst for the book was, apparently, a two-day seminar delivered by the authors in mid-2011 to the Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority. The resulting volume, which provides fascinating insights into insurance as a business - and which covers insurance governance, compliance and regulation, will be of interest  to insurance practitioners  everywhere, as well as of course, to lawyers specializing in insurance.<br /><br />In the current business climate in which failings of governance in the banking sector have become a matter of concern, not just in the business community but with the public at large, the book's focus on governance is nothing if not topical, especial after any number of governments have had to pick up the expensive bills that have followed banking disasters.<br /><br />`Like banks, the insurance industry is vital to the stability of the international financial system,' says Feetham.  `As international standards of corporate governance continue to evolve, businesses will need to adapt their operating systems and structures to take account of the changing regulatory environment.'  To this end, it's useful that the book provides a chapter by Robin Amos on Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA), part of a project known as Solvency II, which is planned to improve the prudential supervision of insurers in the European Union.<br /><br />Including some aptly chosen historical insights, the book covers a wide range of subject matter, from a discussion on the concept of risk in commerce and selection of domicile, to ownership, management and financing, regulatory arbitrage and of course, governance.  So, if you are, in any way, a part of the insurance industry, you'll find this book, with its international perspective, a valuable acquisition for your library.system,' says Feetham.  `As international standards of corporate governance continue to evolve, businesses will need to adapt their operating systems and structures to take account of the changing regulatory environment.'

B000001Y5X|5.0|Such an amazing CD. It came in a timely manner and the case didn't have a scratch on it. I love all of Manson's music. This one sounds much different than the rest of his music but it's still amazing. My favorite is \\"Snake Eyes and Sissies\\".
1903307805|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1S1QTI4UQZBEN]]<br />THIS IS THE LEADING TEXT ON THIS<br />COMPLEX AND DIVERSE SUBJECT NOW IN A NEW EDITION FROM THE LEGAL ACTION GROUP<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />For sheer complexity and diversity, there can be few fields of law more challenging than community care.  As Clements and Thompson point out, community care law results from `a hotchpotch of statutes', all of which create a legal landscape where legislation overlaps (not to mention the overlapping of services) and where `for every general rule there is at least one exception.'<br /><br />These points are certainly made manifest as well as obvious when you read through this thorough and comprehensively researched volume, which is rightly considered as indispensable for those working in this field.<br /><br />It's fair to say that the sheer scope of the subject matter alone is more than a little daunting, as community care involves assisting the vulnerable to live independently either at home, or in a care home.  The law in this area therefore touches on many different disciplines, from healthcare, education, social services and housing, to support for asylum seekers and, basically, issues of human rights.<br /><br />As the Introduction to this comprehensive work of reference reminds us, community care, at its heart, `is about \\"provision in the community of home helps, day centres, meals on wheels and when necessary, accommodation in care homes and more besides.\\"<br /><br />As an arm of the welfare state, community care costs almost £17 billion per annum of public resources in services.'  Come to think of it, the enormity of all this inspires one to consider that the UK should be placed extremely high the list of compassionate societies.  Community care is an aspect of our national life of which we can only be (or should be) proud.<br /><br />If you are a lawyer, or say, a policy worker, voluntary adviser, carer, or employed in relevant areas by a local authority, you need this meticulously footnoted book and the knowledge and research resources contained within its more than 1100 pages, including extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments.<br /><br />Easy to navigate, the book provides a detailed eighty- page index, at least thirteen flowcharts and three appendices containing extracts from legislation, plus regulations and directions as well as precedents. The publication date is noted as at September 2011.ootnoted book and the knowledge and research resources contained within its more than 1100 pages, including extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments.

B0071QIN00|5.0|One of the best games on Android. Easy controls, great graphics, and funny game animations. Completely worth it. Need to get this game at any cost, I got it free, but I would pay a lot for this.
0385523394|4.0|I've read many books that are full of vignettes.  It seems to be everywhere in writing these days.  This, however, really caught my eye when I saw the title, and it proved to be pretty fascinating.  It is riveting to see a person thrown completely out of their element, forced to deal with an environment that operates on a set of rules utterly foreign.  Personally, I think this should be required reading in some sociology programs.  All in all, a good read that was something unique to the non-fiction selections one usually finds.
B005V20JKI|5.0|This is the most awesome game ever. I'm so glad I got it for the free app of the day so I didn't have to pay for it because I bet it was really expensive because of its greatness.
B006PHD0RW|1.0|i had a major problem with downloading and opening this game, which sucks because it looks fun. every time i tried to open it, it says theres a problem and makes me click force close. I've  tried to download it 5 times and it still won't  let me play the game.. :(
0763650420|5.0|Our girls now age 12 & 9 have loved this book since they were toddlers. I've read it a million times over the years! About once every 3-6 mos one of them will pull it from the shelf and ask me to read it. It has become a famly tradition! I plan to purchase two new copies and put up to give them with the birth of their first child. YES...We love this book that much! :)<br /><br />Enjoy & Happy Reading! :)
B005I4JG80|5.0|I'm really enjoying this book, a few chapters into it. The writer is funny and it becomes clear that she's not trying to reinforce/create stereotypes, but rather research how we tend to parent in this time and age in the Western World.  It's really tough to put down - she has a way of sucking you into the story.  As a young woman who plans on having children but doesn't yet have any, I'm still completely interested in the book.  Great read regardless of your situation.  As a former nanny and from an outsiders POV, I too get a little irritated with the whole Dr Spock/treat children with kid gloves mentality that has sprung up and continued over the years.  Children deserve to have a voice, but from what I've learned as a childcare provider over the years, they don't have the life experience to be able to make certain wise choices for themselves yet, so we have to model and help them understand why we at times make decisions for them.  I was glad that she didn't shy away from that - I have seen WAY too much bargaining at bedtime, inconsistency with limits, and too much murkiness with who's actually in charge.  Kids need to understand who's running the show, because when they come to a situation they cannot handle, they have to know their parents or care provider is someone they can run to for help.
B003O85W3A|5.0|When I first heard these songs I was kinda mad they weren't like the big epic songs on Funeral. But after listening to the album for the third time all the way through (months later). I realized this is probably one of my favorite albums ever.  Here's why;<br /><br />1. The songs are still deep and dynamic. Not as balanced as on Funeral but better than Neon Bible without a doubt.<br /><br />2. The songs have that awesome 80's feel that all the indie bands try to emulate but here it's done right.<br />More specifically that E.T. when atari was cool feeling, but not in a cheesy 80's way. In an organic non commercial way.<br />(this is one of the things it took me awhile to realize. with the first listen I didn't notice).<br /><br />3. R&eacute;gine Chassagne sings more on this CD.<br /><br />4. The album has eccentric, and \\"want to go look that up\\" lyrics. The best kind. Sprawl anyone.? Another thing I overlooked.<br /><br />5. The singles are actually good without being over the top. I really don't like AS MUCH by them by themselves but with<br />the whole album they fit perfectly.<br /><br />6. This album is great on a long drive.<br /><br />IN A MORE TANGIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE WAY I FELL LIKE THIS ALBUM IS JUST AS GOOD AS FUNERAL.
0545425115|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about The Hunger Games! This book (and the entire trilogy) is fantastic! Suzanne Collins tells a tragic story filled with brutality and inhumanity in a beautiful way.  Katniss Everdeen inadvertently finds herself a \\"tribute\\" in the 74th annual Hunger Games where she is left to combat to the death against 23 other tributes. Each tribute will need intelligence, strength and perseverance if they have any hope of being the last one standing. As if that thought alone was not stressful enough, the entire thing will be televised for all to see. Katniss enters the Games with every intention of coming back, but what will happen when she meets a boy named Peeta, and everything changes?  I do not want to give too much of the story line away, but I urge you to read these books! You will not be disappointed. The story line is action packed and keeps the reader wanting more!
B003L77G06|5.0|MODERN FAMILY gives me faith in TV again. The art of of delicious comedy writing is not lost. Yes, MODERN FAMILY is so delightfully funny and heartwarming that you want to totally eat up every splendid moment.  Life in today's world has drastically changed the family module and hence we have the MODERN FAMILY - a blend of different families and cultures untited in their family love. This family is outrageous and yet totally delightful on all levels. Jay is the family patriarch and is married to the much young and totally sexy Gloria who brings a young son to the new marriage. Jay's daughter Claire has the traditional marriage with a husband three kids. Jay's son Mitchell is live the alternate lifestyle with his gay partner Cam and their adopted daughter from Vietnam.  The one-liners in this show are zingers. Don't miss a second. The writing and the acting are exceptional. It is like every piece fell perfectly together to form a wonderful show.  Sprinkle in hilarious guest stars like Nathan Lane and Shelly Long and the show gets even better.  MODERN FAMILY is a total must for any comedy fan. Don't miss it.
B0078JOAOI|5.0|I had actually forgotten about the second half of this season for a little while, we bought the episode, and after the first 10 minutes, I actually said out loud 'Oh yea, that's right, I love this show!'  The show gets right back into where it left off after the first half of the season without any lengthy 'Last Time on the Walking Dead' type of summary, which I liked that you got a few extra minutes of 'new show'.  If you don't remember anything from the first half of the season, perhaps watch episode 7 again, but if it's fresh in your mind at all, just jump right into this one. Tensions are running high in this one, especially right at the start, I don't want to give away any storyline, but if you liked the first 1 1/2 seasons, you will like this episode.  Also, one thing I forgot to do when I purchased it was to go for the HD quality episode.  I watched this in SD on my living room TV, and I regretted not chipping in the extra $1.  The rest of this season I will be purchasing in HD.
B0000DZ3DR|5.0|Two of these tracks are among the greatest recordings in my large collection:  Gypsy Rider and Phil Ochs' Changes.  Tracks 4-through-8 are only a couple notches below that level.  Carla Olson was a perfect foil and provides Crosby caliber harmony.  Must have for anyone who liked any Gene Clark music.  Check out the youtube performance of Gypsy Rider while you're at it.
B005H0IW76|5.0|I love classic Christmas songs, and Michael Buble' does an amazing job that ranks right up there with my favorite Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra Christmas CDs!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Exactly as described.  This flash memory card is perfect for camera videos which take up massive amounts of memory.  Holds thousands of high quality pics.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Nothing new in concept, but a fun take. Above par graphics and design make it well worth picking up to pass some time.
B005Q1W10A|1.0|The music, house and clothes are beautiful. All very well done.  But the acting and storylines are cartoonish!  I found myself  laughing out loud at the miracle recovery, the bufoonish doctor, the servants  talking back!!  It's like a cliff notes version of a harlequin romance.  I recommend the old Upstairs Downstairs.  Never lived like the filthy rich parasites but the relationship between the two classes makes more sense.  Much better acting, fully developed characters and storylines.  It looks dated but still excellent.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|We enjoyed it so much we have already purchased year two.  We feel confident that it that year two it will be as good as year one,
0061537934|5.0|The great thing about this book is the story of Denny and his family and his ambition all told from the eyes of Enzo.  I am both a dog lover and a car enthusiast and, more importantly, an owner of many Ferrari's.  Most don't know that the man, Ferrari's first name was Enzo.  It took me a few pages to realize that Denny had named his beautiful friend for the great master, Ferrari.  Even though Denny drove a BMW and would race any car offered to him, his true love was the Ferrari.  He and Eve had a daughter, Zoe.  One time in this book, Denny refers to Enzo as Zo.  I believe that Zoe was also named for Enzo Ferrari.  I read the book once and suddenly all of the pieces fell in place.  It talks about dreams and secret desires and reincarnation.  I thought the book would be very sad but it ended as one of the happiest that I have ever read.  Enzo, as the Mongolian legend predicts, is ready to become a man after his death and he does reincarnated as the little boy, Enzo, in the last chapter.  The young boy believed Senna was the greatest Ferrari driver, that ever lived until he watched Denny.  Enzo also watched video tapes of auto races and he knew that the car follows the eyes.  The dog became the boy and both Zoe and Denny knew it.  What a beautiful ending.  I loved this book!!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|A great escape! You get drawn in and don't want to put it down. A great puzzle game with just enough difficulty to feel  challenged. The hints and map are great tools to use if you want assistance. It's not the longest game, but it will occupy you for several hours.  You won't be dissapointed. Not a game for young children (too tricky to navigate). Although they might enjoy watching you play.WORTH THE MONEY!! You will not be dissapointed!!!!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Had a problem at first, then the dev helped me out and now things are running smoothly.  Great game. I love it.

B005KELQEU|5.0|Since I had ordered a slightly used item, I was very impressed that I could not tell my purchase was not brand new.  I will  order like this again.  I am satisfied with my sleeve case for my Kindle.
0385534639|5.0|This is a spectacular story.  The author turns even the most insignificant things, such as smell, texture, and weight into important and significant part of the tale. The entire world envelops the reader and you will not want to leave the Night Circus.
B006UG90RM|3.0|The good: Van Halen's back with some strong new songs.  The bad: The sound mix is horrible in my opinion.  I'm sure others will disagree, but to me the sound is very muddy and the vocals are completely washed out. I'm half expecting an email saying there was an error and to re-download the album. Sounds terrible compared to other songs on my ipod.  I'm a huge VH fan from way back- VanHalen, not VanHagar- and I really want to like this album, but can't get past the muddy sound.
B002AT4KA0|3.0|Great movie. Just very disapointed we did not get the 2nd DVD! It does set up nicely for the next movie in the series/
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Got it right on time and its a great CD! I got this album for my little preteen sister because Kelly is one of her favorite artists that is upbeat and positive in her music
1609419693|5.0|I just finished listening to the audio book of Bossypants for a book club.  I probably would not have chosen this on my own, and am grateful to the person who did, *and* I am grateful that I decided to listen to it during my commute rather than reading it because Tina Fey telling the story is like riding in the car with her (made for a much more enjoyable commute).  From her funny tales of growing up, developing her profession, and 30 Rock anecdotes, I enjoyed her perspective and tone.  I had only seen a few episodes of 30 Rock before this, and hadn't planned on watching it.  I have started the series now, and am enjoying that as well.  Tina is great!  I recommend this to women (not sure if men would find it as funny) who don't take life too seriously, or maybe those who do and would like a break from reading typical nonfiction and novels.
1609611543|5.0|This book is amazing. Dr. Davis exposes the new strands of hybridization wheat for what they are. I have Celiac disease. The rates of Celiac and wheat sensitivity are on the rise. I truly believe it is the new types of wheat that are making people sick.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I purchased my Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover just one month ago (1/13/2012).  The back top left corner (opposite the strap) has already started to peel away from the plastic coating. The worn spot is about the size of a thumbnail.  It is also peeling near where the Kindle is turned off and on.  I have not used the Kindle excessively and take care when I do use it.  I have not used it outdoors and cannot believe it is wearing already.  It is sad to think what the cover will look like in a few months. I like the idea that it can be used as a support for the reader, but had I known it would wear out so soon, I would have opted for a hard shell cover.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very fun and challenging even though some people say they don't like it its a great game for a kindle fire because you have over a hundred games in one app
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun and easy way to pass time.I would recommend to anyone with opacity or kindle fire. and I still haven't finished nearly half the games.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it great but. needs more games,.............yea yea yea oh yea yes it great but needs moore games yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea

B001APYHGM|4.0|The only reason I didn't put 5 stars is because it's a little on the bloody side but still a great movie.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|not very good way to spend time, I mean I would play this app if I could not sleep at night!

B004EPZ0BG|4.0|Was it predictable? Of course.<br />Was it Oscar winning material? No way.<br />Was it hilarious? Way more than I anticipated!<br /><br />We picked up this movie on a whim -- the movie we wanted was out and so we figured a \\"fluffy\\" rom-com would just have to do. We ended up laughing ourselves silly watching all of the antics and hearing the hilarious banter between Timberlake & Kunis.<br /><br />They could have edited out the whole bit with Timberlake's father and still had a good effect. That part felt like it was supposed to \\"tear jerker\\" material but it was so out of place that I didn't feel connected to it at all. A different plot twist could have brought them to the end.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone looking to have fun while watching a light-hearted movie with lots of laughs.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is not bad, after all you are getting 121 games for free. It also helps pass the time. having to open more games gives you something to work for.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I am an avid believer in the 90 minute movie. More than that and I can always pick out areas that could have been edited down (or out). With The Help I can't say that anything could or should be edited out--it really was that good.<br /><br />I was hesitant to watch this movie due to its length (146 minutes!) so I waited a while before I made the commitment. I'm glad that I didn't see it in the theater and I'm glad I finally did see it (at home, where I could make breaks).<br /><br />The story ranged from funny to horrifying and in the end good conquered evil. It really makes you sit back and reflect on how far we have come -- and yet in many ways, still not far enough. If you are interested in Civil Rights era history, social justice and feminism then this is a movie you'll enjoy.<br /><br />I've never read the book so I can't comment on how closely it sticks to it, but I didn't feel as if any question were left unanswered or that any parts of the story weren't matching up.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 was due to length. I made it through but I can imagine that someone who isn't as interested in the historical time period and with little patience might not enjoy it as much as I did.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I had the Razer Megaladon first and was pretty disappointed.  I hadn't used any other headsets previous to that so I kept it until my dog ate through the USB cable which doesn't detach so Razer said I was out of luck to have it fixed and would have to buy another one since the USB cable was not detachable from the headset..  Soo... I gave the G930 a try and I'm glad I did.  Much, much more bass compared to the Megaladon, it's wireless and power is a separate attachment so if my dog gets a taste for USB cabling again I'm sure it's replaceable without having to spend another $150-175 and a new headset.  Sound quality is excellent... for headphones.  I'm yet to have headphones match my 4.1 Altec Lansings but for headphones, this comes pretty close.  Modern Warfare 2 still has that ttttcchhhh sound (compressed) when shooting something like a shottie but it doesn't seem to distort the headset.  Volume levels are generally more than you need so you probably won't max out the volume level.  Nades and explosions are big & heavy at default settings.  The headphones themselves, due to the side swivels feel like they're going to fall apart when you take them out of the box.  I don't see a need for swivels and I figure they'd do better to set the sides to fixed for perceived sturdiness.  Not really fond of the look.  Razer's stuff definitely looks really cool but the end verdict comes down to how it sounds and G930 really does sound about twice as good as the Razer Megaladon.
0062082353|5.0|I'm a 60 year old grandmother and LOVED THIS BOOK!!! I thought it was well written and will appeal to the masses. You don't have to be a Navy Seal to \\"get it\\". I felt Chris's anger, pride, frustration, loss and guilt. Other books will give you more detail of Navy Seal's or shooting techniques but this one covers a bit of everything. I borrowed this book from the library but will be buying it from Amazon soon. It's a keeper to be re-read every few years. And Chris? Thank you.

B003O86FMW|1.0|this book did not impress me.  If I had to recommend the series to someone I would say to read the first book, then read the last 100 pages of the 3rd book because there is nothing missed in Catching Fire and I can only assume there will be barely more missed in the 3rd one until the end.<br /><br />*Spoiler alert*  Not only does it feel way too forced and rushed of a storyline, but its lukewarm and its sappy the way Katniss is reminding the reader every 5 sentences of the \\"over-arching plot to save Peeta at all costs\\".  The arena itself is boring, the action is VERY boring and occurs rapidly, unlike the first book where you had alot of time to get drawn in and watch the arena unfold. Everything here is over in a couple days and i was just in a hurry to get to the end and be done with it.  The alliance is boring, the enemies aren't convincing and what else can i say negatively about this book?<br /><br />I'm now afraid that the 3rd will shape up the same way. I wish the author had taken a page out of JK Rowling's playbook and built UP the books as they went along, sort of like how the 7th Harry Potter was longer and more detailed than the 6th, which were more significant than the 5th and so on.  This series leaves me believing its written for 16 year olds with the utter lameness of the 2nd book's plot and character development (hint:  there is none).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this one out loud to my husband. We found ourselves reading for hours at a time, and I finally lost my voice, but this book was so good it was worth it. Katniss is such a good character that when you finish the book you almost feel like you've lost a friend, and so you read the next book in the series.  If the first book is excellent, then the second was very good ... but the third was a disappointment. I would still suggest reading the whole trilogy, and have told many of my friends about these books, but I wish the third book had had some of the fire of te first two, and not as much depression.

B0015XASFS|5.0|I bought this mainly for the DVD, but the CD is good too. The concert is amazing - the musicians are so talented, the sound incredible, and of course the icing on the cake is Josh Groban's fabulous voice and warm personality. All these elements and talent combine to produce a visual and musical treat for JG fans. The bonus features are great too, really making this worth the money spent. They show life on the road for JG and his wonderful band and crew and take the fans backstage, giving a real taste of what life is like day to day for a touring band. We get to meet Sweeney the dog, who's very cute, made more so by the fact he has the same hairstyle as his owner! The CD doesn't have half as many songs on it as the concert itself, but it's still great value for money. I'll enjoy both for a long time to come.
B0078JOAOI|5.0|let me say that this show is amazing an i love it, this latest episode was so good an worth the wait these characters are really coming into there own especially rick, how could u not like this show? this episode was awesome an i believe this show will only get better anything to do with zombies is always good :)

B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I used this thing on an every other day basis for maybe 3 months before it broke. Terrible!

B002V091IO|2.0|I really wish I could be more complimentary about this book.  I had high hopes for it at the start of the book but the ending really just spoiled it for me.  I just don't get the ending at all!? Seriously David Nicholls, what were you thinking dude?
B0000DK4PO|1.0|This product didn't work. After it was received as the gift I inteneded to cheer someone up, and it didn't work, I found out that it was made for use in the UK. Don't you think that would have been a good thing to say on the websight for customers to know before ordering it?
0761158464|5.0|My 6-year-old son loves this book.  He is a big Star Wars fan and the pages of this book seem to come alive with favorite scenes from many of the movies.  There are not a lot of words on the pages but that is probably okay because he is more interested in looking at the amazing scanimations than listening to me read the book!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a fun game. Kinda reminds me of cut the rope. It is very addictive. Got it free today but so work the 99 cents
B005UKJX4E|1.0|I bought this from Amazon because it is a 2012 Academy Award nominee for Best Picture.  This movie is crap.  It is disjointed, confusing, disappointing, lacks a recognizable story line and made my wife and I both unhappy after watching it.  Don't waste YOUR money.  I can only be grateful, I didn't waste a lot more money watching it in the theaters.  It also leads increasing credence to the complete lack of credibility to the Academy who nominates and votes on crap like this that is passed off as entertainment.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app! It is really easy to get music from youtube, except for the songs that don't have a music video. That was annoying. But it's still a great app!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Even the casting of actors, not singers doesn't harm stephen sondheim's brilliance.  I've seen the original broadway cast, this tim burton version and the brilliant broadway revival with lupone and cerveris.  There's ample reason to see each one. This being said, i wish it wasn't directed by tim burton who thinks he's way more important than the material of everything he's ever directed.  Depp has his moments...Bonham Carter has hers, but they just don't have the singing chops for arguably the most important musical ever written.  I compare Mr. Sondheim to Mr. Shakespeare because the words they both write so lyrically can seemingly shine triumphantly through mediocre performances and misdirection...This film is still worth seeing because everyone needs to know of Stephen Sondeim's profound gift for this medium.  HIGHLIGHT: Depp slashing throats during the \\"Johanna Reprise\\"
B006RED4GA|2.0|The atmosphere and scares were effective toward old fashioned gothic style horror - my favorite kind. The movie had a different feel to it than most horror films; quiet and intentionally slow moving. The camera work really kept me interested but in the end, the drudging pace and lack of any point kills this movie before - in the last 20 minutes -  it has a chance to redeem itself which it fails at. Why? Becasue there is absolutely no reason for anything in this film. Not the ghosts, not the ghosts' stories not the guests and not the freeking inkeepers! Pat Heely as Luke was fun to watch and I love his acting in this. He's amusing but I can take him seriously. I think his quality gave this movie that different edge. Sara Paxton's [main character] acting was mostly good but at times, her attempts at 'cute, geeky and quirky' were cringe worthy and took me way out of the film.  Ultimately, this movie was all dressed up in the trappings of gothic horror but nowhere to go=[
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Two best things I love about this - very high quality video and very high quality sound. I may be a little biased because I am absolutely infatuated by Adele and her amazing voice and musical talent... I had this turned up quite loud all the way through. I LOVE that it came with a CD copy of all the live music. It hasn't left my car stereo since it arrived. If you like Adele, this is definitely a must have item.

B001E45XT4|4.0|As the title states these are above average headphones for the price. Recently my PC headset took and dump and I though I was take a chance purchasing these. Like some of the reviews have stated they are a little tight. I have found that if I tilt them forward a bit they seem to fit ok. I have a set of turtle beaches for xbox I can't say they are any better than these. I do like how the mic folds up into the headband itself. No issues on vent/teamspeak/skype. Gave it a 4/5 just for comfort. They would be that much more awesome if the sides lit up red! Not a bad buy.

1451627289|5.0|I'm a time travel junkie.  I love love love to read anything time travel, watch movies about time travel... I'll even spend a couple days' worth of time on archived Internet forums reading about a guy who claimed to be from the future searching for a piece of an old IBM computer (John Titor fans, hello!).  So when Stephen King's 11/22/63 was released, you can bet a time-travelling phone booth or two that I was gonna read it.<br /><br />This book began with a delicious concept - a wormhole placed randomly in the back pantry of an old diner allowed for the traveler to be transported back in time to 1958.  Any changes effected upon the past would still be in place upon return to the present, but returning back to 1958 through that wormhole again will \\"reset\\" the changes entirely.  Go back in time, spend a couple of years wreaking havoc and having fun, come back to now, go back in, and any damage caused is undone - no hard feelings.  No consequences.<br /><br />Al, the owner of the diner where our friendly wormhole keeps residence, has concocted a plan to go back in time, wait until 1963, and save Kennedy from assassination.  He'd do it himself, but lung cancer isn't patient, so he asks Jake, our main squeeze, to follow through.  Al's taken notes, gone back in time numerous times (resetting the past with each trip) and feels almost certain Oswald acted alone.  Jake's job is to take the \\"almost\\" out of that equation, and ultimately save Kennedy!<br /><br />Along the way to 1963, Jake attempts to adjust the lives of some unfortunate people whom he knows in his current iteration.  While a school teacher in real life, he poses as a contemporary-to-the-late-1950s version, as well.  He falls in love.  He commits murder.  He saves lives.  Ultimately, his goal to save Kennedy has an unexpected ending.<br /><br />MILD SPOILERS IN NEXT TWO PARAGRAPHS<br />Finishing 11/22/63, I felt very conflicted.  As we saunter through our lives, our memories are created with others.  Rarely does a human create a bounty of memories created alone, or specifically not shared with anybody.  A man may climb a mountain alone, but he does so in order to share the ordeal with people... to inspire them, challenge them, share with them.  For Jake, in the end, I felt that he had nobody to share his ridiculously amazing experiences with, and it made me feel the whole journey was a waste of time.  I'd feel almost as if the whole thing were a dream, after a while of not sharing, and wonder if I'm crazy to even consider it was an actual set of events.<br /><br />I feel a lot of disappointment for the ultimate position Jake is left in.  Sure, it's bittersweet, and sure he is grateful for the experience, but was it worth it?  What could he have done with his life without taking on the burden of Al's wish?  These questions don't detract from the story; rather, I enjoy how much I feel  my feelings in this book. No question, I recommend this book!ed alone, or specifically not shared with anybody.

1469984202|5.0|I've been reading science fiction since the 1960's.  It isn't often that you find an author that can place you in his world within a few paragraphs.  Hugh Howey's \\"Wool\\" series is equivalent to donning a virtual reality bodysuit.  The characters, plot development, environment architecture and dialogue are rich and complex.  A most enjoyable experience that left me wanting more of Hugh's world.<br /><br />I've gone on to read the Molly Fyde series as well, which I can also recommend.<br /><br />Hugh is destined to be one of the people I recommend when people ask for great SF, right alongside Niven, Pohl, Bear and Heinlein.
B004I2K4E8|2.0|NICK JONAS AS MARIUS.  What were they thinking in giving a role like Marius to Nick Jonas.... R U Kidding me...  Seriously.  Nick Jonas is standing next Ramin Karimloo and you can tell what a high school amateur he is.  I really wanted to buy this but rented it on Amazon first to check it out and Nick RUINED this production. He's constantly looking off to the side as if he's reading the words off of a tele-prompter.  I don't get it???  Also Alfie Boe is a great singer, but the guy needs to take a lesson from Colm Wilkinson and learn when to use a little dynamics and not always sing the big stuff as BIG and as operetic as he does.  IMO the 10th anniversary is far and above a much better show when it comes to the quality of singers.  The one singer that really stands out is Samantha Barks as Eponine.  Fantastic.  If your a HUGE fan, than get it.. I still might... But I still can't get over Nick Jonas...  UGH.

B00632HWOG|1.0|I didn't think it was possible for this app to get any worse but with the latest update it did indeed get worse. Messages now take forever to load, or worse: I get a blank screen sometimes when the message finally opens. Oh, did I mention that the app doesn't capture all my contacts? When I go to enter someone's name I find certain names missing, yet these same contacts are in my phone's Yahoo app, as well as on the desktop version of Yahoo mail.  I will make sure to not accept this latest update on my android phone, and will delete the app from my Kindle Fire.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I just finished the last Hunger Games book. Crazy, compelling, heartbreaking, resonating, gripping. Those are just a few adjectives to describe the series. This is truly a story that builds all the way from the start of the first to the finish of the third book. If you haven't checked it out, do it!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It's small and easy to use, light weight and protects. It can stand up i have done it but i just don't stand it up to watch shows so i hold it more which the light weight thing is best there. So i like it, I love it, i would order more of it.<br /><br />Edit 4-2-2012<br />Case is still holding up great. Works perfect for watching movies and taking care of the Fire. Onto of it I am starting to get people asking where to get one themselves once they see how light weight it is. Very good buy.

I'm nearing 70 but still enjoy the more current music and I find this very \\"heartfelt\\" music.  \\"21\\" is not the same mumbled words over and over with background music so loud that you can't hear or understand the words.  I watched the Grammy's and as stated before - this is sooo very refreshing after watching/listening to some of the performers.

I love my android and will not traded off so i am trading amazon Kindle to alternative service's that have better features across all platforms. After all that is why i chose Amazon to not get marraid to one platform. that sad thing is that they do have the app that works on android they just dont give it to non kindle fire users.

0312330537|1.0|Ok this may turn out to be a really gripping book, God knows the Da Vinci Code was rubbish but i happily blazed through it whilst sat on a beach. This novel may similarly turn out to be full of twists and turns and highs and lows but im not sure if i will ever get to them. I have reached page 200 and have had to stop as i cant take the ridiculous cliche ridden pseudo-philosophy that accompanies every single; conversation, street, hotel room, chance meeting, journey, meal, conversation etc etc. Around 70% of every page is a dense thicket of vomitous gibberish.  A damned good editor is required here. My wife reads books like this in a few hours as she has a habit of skipping massive sections of each page and just taking in what's happening. Unfortunately I can't read like that. So im going to give this to my wife and then ask her for a summary when she is finished.  This must be a very good story considering all of the positive reviews, but it is some of the poorest writing i have come across for a long time. Disappointed.

B005JZBP8W|2.0|This is one sad blu ray! Fox missed a great opportunity of transferring this classic onto blu ray. This is one of the WORST blu rays I have seen!! The picture is three different shades. There is a white shade on both sides of the widescreen picture and the middle looks normal (which ain't saying much). What in the world happened to this transfer? These guys who \\"restored\\" it boasts about it, but I don't see the proof. What was Fox thinking!? They have botched up several blu ray titles lately by throwing together old transfers onto the blu ray market. This is not fair!!! Don't release this rubbish if you are not going to give us the best this movie can be. The soundtrack is awesome, why can't the picture be just as awesome? Fox needs to recall and refuse to sell this particular title on blu ray until they fix the problem and give this classic the \\"true\\" restoration it truly deserves. And get someone in there to supervise what is going on, these transfers from 1998 ain't going to cut it in our hi-def world! The two stars are for the audio only. It is in marvelous 7.1 and sounds great! Maybe I am too picky in my viewings, but for blu ray we should demand top quality transfers of these classics or leave them only on DVD. We consumers need to be treated fairly. And this is one of my favorites!<br />You have been warned about this blu ray. It is annoying and hard to look at.  :(

B0078JOAOI|5.0|*This review is for the current episode only and not the entire show*  With this episode, The Walking Dead has finally picked up in intensity. \\"Nebraska\\" was reminiscent of the kind of breathtaking and gripping episodes we got to see in the first season as it was intelligent, thought provoking and tackled some of the tough issues from the inside out. It also finally got off that sanctimonious tone we had to endure for the most part of the second season where everyone sort of agreed that Shane was wrong and the bad guy and Hershel had a valid point. Rick also finally gets some things about the reality of their situation into his head and reaches a pivotal moment.  The line of who is good and bad and what is wrong and what is right is a thin one. Dale walks around warning everyone that Shane is dangerous and that he murdered Otis, but the bar scene with those two shady guys with a murderous agenda showed us that they were going to need someone of Shane's attitude to handle the situation; Rick had to do what needed to be done. Simple as that. For the first time he stood on the other side of the fence where Shane usually stands, where tough decisions have to be made. It was clear from the way the two guys behaved that they were going to be worse than the Walkers: the fat dude was already talking about pretty much raping women if he got his fingers on some and the other one gave off a creepy, dangerous vibe and pulled the gun on Rick. Rick had to act in a split second and make that call and he made the right call. The question now is: is Shane really a bad guy? What is good and bad anymore in this world? In this reality? Had Shane not sacrificed Otis, Carl would have died just as Rick, Hershel and Glenn would have died had Rick not killed the two intruders.  This show is great at showing us how humans behave, on the deepest level, when their existence is threatened. It was very realistic and it begs the question of whether you can afford to still live by the old rule book, as Rick insists, in a world that has no rules anymore; no societal ones at least (hence that guy pi$$ing right in the corner of the restaurant, like an animal in the wild, and not even bothering to step out. He doesnt need to. Who is going to stop him? The owner? The cops?)  Shane was a man of the law before the fall, yet after the world came to an end, he just had to make some tough decisions - first small ones, then big ones, such as sacrificing Otis to make it out; he did things he would never have done before. This show is doing a great job at getting to the bottom of that pit and digging through what is the human aspect; the human heart.  The desperation and existential desolation these people are facing in a world gone under and ravaged by disease is palpable, especially during the conversation Rick and Hershel have in the bar about hope and what to live for anymore in the face of such apocalyptic devastation.  (On a side note, does anyone else think that the girl who is all sick might actually be turning to a Walker? They say she is burning up which is usually a sign of having gotten sick. Not sure, but thought this was interesting.)  Lastly, I loved that hopefully with Lori's accident, they might actually put an end to this stupid and ridiculous pregnancy story line that's just degraded the show to soap opera level. The only misgiving I have is more of an afterthought really, which is that I hope they really will NOT stay on little house in the prairie much longer. The show needs to move on. I mean it is becoming pretty obvious that they are forced to work on low budget so they've been at the same location for the entire season so far. That's not good. The introduction of these two strangers put tension in the show which was great and we need more of that. I dont think most people would want to see another 12 episodes of these people working through their feelings and emotions with zombies thrown in for fun. They really should never have fired Darabont. He was the one who made this show the breathtaking piece we got to see in season 1.

B005LAIGN2|3.0|Red Tails is a captivating film that delves into the issue of racial inequality and segregation in the military during World War II. This movie is based on true events that transpired during the height of the Jim Crow era, and it is a story that George Lucas (creator of Star Wars) felt needed to be shared in full cinematic capacity. The story revolves around the 332nd Tuskegee Fighter Group, which was comprised of elite African American pilots. The main theme of this film is based on the fact that the United States government did not have faith in African American pilots and concluded that they were mentally and genetically inferior to whites because of biased case studies that took place in 1925. Therefore, they deduced that the Airmen could not complete combat missions, but when the U.S. and European powers had their backs against the wall because the Nazi's were gaining the upper hand, it was up to the Tuskegee Fighter Group to help win the war against tyranny.<br /><br />Red Tails had great subplots, which will keep you engaged throughout the film, plus the characters are well developed and emotional. You will get a sense of being right in the middle of the action because the CGI used was impeccable. Overall, this was a historically entertaining piece of cinematography that any fan of these types of movies will enjoy. This is a must watch film because of its historical value, plus the fact that Terrance Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. star in the film is a plus since they always give outstanding performances.<br /><br />Red Tails receives Three STARS!!!!!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Was so pumped for a new VH record and boy was I blown away!  Was a lil skeptical due to some of the last few records with Sammy having some odd directions musically.  But man, they just laid the gauntlet down on this one.  Glad to see real hard rock is back!  Can't wait to see them live again in April!  Yeah, there's a couple of songs I'd give a B- to, but most are A level songs for sure.
0307959856|4.0|If I can write a book of this quality when I am PD JAmes age, and after a lifetime of fine writing, then I would be happy. No, I would be ecstatic!  I was delighted to see her effort. She is the only writer who could have attempted this and not been laughed at for her efforts. And she pulls it off.  It is a wonderful book, full of Jane like writing and turns of phrase but ultimately not really a mystery so much as a novel of character. My only disappointment was how dull Elizabeth had become since she married Darcy. There is a lot of fascinating detail about the police and criminal justice system in England, that Jane Austen never included in her novels..of course, she didn't need to as she was writing contemporaneously.  Definitely you must read this if you love either Jane or PD.

I first owned an i-Phone in which I first downloaded this app &amp; have since owned an android phone. I'm saying that this app has influenced my decision of devices as long as my new techno gadget can download this app. It&rsquo;s that good of an app! I now can take several translations of the Bible w/me 2 church w/out the bulk of carrying several Bibles! My highest accolades go 2 YouVersion!

1594203334|5.0|I was in Bali, Indonesia several years ago, staying at a hotel that provided free breakfast to its guests.  There was a French family (with five children: ages 1-12, approximately)staying there, and each morning, the waitresses brought out one fruit smoothie at a time, one plate of food at a time, etc.  Charming hotel; take-your-time service.  Anyway, I was captivated by this family because I noticed how they were all talking to each other, enjoying each other's company - and waiting patiently for their food.  There was no fighting, whining, or anything like that for the entire week.  I wondered at the time, was this a French thing - or just this particular French family?  Then, I forgot about that until I started reading this book last week!  The negative reviews on here for this book are startling to me.  Some just sound as if they have a personal axe to grind while others sound self-righteous (e.g. \\"I'm such a perfect American parent that I'm offended anyone would think I need to read this book\\").  The author's point is not to attack or offend; she's simply discussing her personal journey in discovering what works for her and her children.  Druckerman is mostly mocking herself, and she very clearly states that not all French parents do x, not all American parents do y, etc. - and that she is not focusing on the entire French population.  One of her points - albeit implicit at times - is that there is an overall difference between middle to upper-middle class families in Paris, compared to those in New York City with regard to child rearing.  I am nearly finished with this book and have found it one of the most interesting, readable, humorous books I've read in the last few months(I'm an avid reader), and I don't even have kids!  I am a teacher, so I do see first-hand, everyday episodes of impatience and children who demand that their needs be met right away.  Yes, there are many American parents who parent well and work to mitigate this poor type of behavior, butthis is not commonplace in our society, and if we're all really honest with  ourselves (been out to dinner lately when other families with children are also in the restaurant?), we can recognize this.  Anyway, if you want to laugh and are interested in opening your minds up to a different culture - and you're responsible for shaping young people in some regard - order this book right now!  It's fascinating and thought-provoking!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game absolutely does deserve 5 stars because it is very very fun to play and the graphics are excellent. It runs smooth as butter on my toshiba thrive running honeycomb 3.2 (rooted). However I do not want and have a huge problem with openfeint.

0385342063|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is back, with another of her quirky, vulnerable and appealing heroines who, in the Kinsella style, manages to embroil herself in a wacky set of circumstances.  Poppy Wyatt has it all:  a job she loves, a handsome fiance and an heirloom emerald and diamond engagement ring.  Oh, and the most important accessory someone of the millennial generation can possess:  a cell phone.  When she loses both the ring and her phone on the same really bad day, she doesn't know what to do - until she sees a phone in a trash can and grabs it instead so that she can continue to follow up on where the ring might be.  Holding someone else's phone gives her access to all of that person's calls...emails...text messages...until we're off into a scenario that only Sophie Kinsella could pull off.  Which she does.  I won't give any more of the plot details because I don't want to create any spoilers, so I will just say this: first of all, kudos to Ms. Kinsella for managing to work our modern-day technology into a novel and keep it entertaining at the same time.  Secondly,  like all the books by this author, this one is laugh-out-loud funny and hard to put down.  And thirdly, as in most books by this author, can you see the happy ending coming a mile off?  Well, yes - but there are a lot of unexpected twists along the way.  And more importantly, it's a whole lot of fun getting there.
0345531930|5.0|My first book of John Grisham was \\"The firm\\", very thrilling. But this one, IT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING, by the fact that just simple things that can happen to a lawyer, no fancy things, just plain simple. It keeps you hooked all the time.  FANTASTIC
1400052181|3.0|This is a fascinating look at the story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor woman who died in the early 1950s from a particular virulent form of cervical cancer.  At the time scientists were trying to find human cells that would stay alive in a test tube beyond just a day or so, so they could conduct research. Henrietta had this cancer along with syphilis (and possibly gonorrhea) - essentially a perfect storm of ingredients. When they scraped her cancer cells and put them in test tubes not only did they not die, they replicated at an astonishing rate. Today her cells are used all over the world and have been used to help countless patients, and have provided medical advancements that have eased the pain and help cure the sick. It's been a boon to mankind.<br /><br /> Not being in the medical field, I had not heard of HeLa cells before. It was fascinating to find out about them. Indeed the ethical questions raised are of great interest - whether or not we can take someone's cells without permission and profit from them. Remember that back when Henrietta's cells were taken, everyone else's were as well - there weren't the issues of privacy and informed consent that we have today.<br /><br />Henrietta's cells were not taken from her because she was black, and all the evidence pointed to the fact that she got the standard medical care of the day. By focusing on the racial issue I think it's misleading and ultimately dangerous because by doing so, people can then dismiss real examples of racial prejudice by not taking them seriously.<br /><br /> No doubt it's a terrible tragedy that the Lacks family has inadequate medical care today - but I think that's a tragedy for anyone without it.<br /><br />I think this book would make for a great book club discussion. There are several doctors in my book club and we had a really interesting time talking about all this.

B003EY7IRC|4.0|First, let me say that I did like this series. However, I feel like I've been reading it forever...and I don't think it's actually been that long.  I do like how we were able to see Mac change and grow up through the series, from a girl that was very girly to a woman. I liked Barrons, and thought he was super sexy but he became tiresome for me. Maybe I was just over it. It felt as if I slugged through this last book and just wanted it to be over. In the end, I'm not really sure I cared what happened to anyone.  Some people have written that they wondered what happened to Dani and that her storyline just sort of ended, I myself felt that she was useless. I understand that she was supposed to be a fill-in for Mac and her relationship with Alina, but the girl got on my nerves.  All in all, I'm not sure I would necessarily reccomend this series but the first couple were entertaining.
B000089RV6|5.0|What's left to be said about this album?  I believe it's what, #2 on the best selling records of all time?  I'm a big proponent of the \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD's.  I own quite a few.  There's just too much I want to own, and for certain artists, owning a CD full of their best stuff is perfect.  But AC/DC doesn't have a Greatest Hits compilation.  So what's the next best thing?  Get \\"Back in Black\\".  It's nearly a greatest hits record.  I love every song on here but one (just not a big fan of Given the Dog a Bone).  Of course there are the big 3, but there are a full 7 major hits on this CD.  An absolute rock classic, one of the best ever released.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are great, the music isn't annoying and the groceries are cute lmaoooo! As long as they roll out timely updates filled with new challenges and maybe new groceries, this will remain in my app drawer :)

0061969656|4.0|Ever since my first reading of Cornwell's book \\"The Fort\\", I haven't stopped purchasing his books. His ability to create such intense reality to has characters and story line is beyond compare! In my opinion there is no one that can create a battle scene so well that you can actually feel as though you're in the middle of it all!  After finishing the first five books of the Saxon Tales, I had awaited anxiously for the sixth book to be released; \\"Death to Kings\\". I read the book, non stop in two days and I wasn't disappointed in the least! It was great getting back to the life of Uhtred and his adventures against the Danes. Cornwell left the possibility of yet another book in this amazing series; one more time, I'm on the waiting list!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|So far, I have really enjoyed this game.  Have not played much, but it takes some thought to get the bags filled.
B004FOA84A|1.0|waste of money. not very fun at all. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. very short and not worth a dollar
1595827684|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Mass Effect games the world created around it. So with Mass Effect 3 on the horizon I jumped when this book came up for pre-order. And it was well worth the wait. It is full of the unique feel and art of the Mass Effect world. But it isn't endless amazing art, a lot of it shows the various sketches and design changes that different characters went through. It is broken into three section for each of the Mass Effect games. This shows how some character have changed over the course of this universe spanning adventure. Since the game is not out there are a few spoilers you will run across in the book in the Mass Effect 3 section. It doesn't give away any story that I could see, but it does show the art for some characters you will meet and recruit that haven't been mentioned yet in the previews. If you read between the lines it also strongly hints at some story elements. That said I saw no harm in it and was actually a little excited to know a little more before the game releases. It just increases my desire for the game. All in all I was very happy with this book. The hardcore Mass Effect fans will see it as a must have. But for any fan of the Space Opera genre will find a lot of wonderful art and design elements in this book.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|At first I thought this would be a dumb game, but boy was I wrong! It is cute and fun, and quite addicting! Who knew bagging groceries would be so addictive?!
0345440900|5.0|I found this book to be very helpful and purchased it on a friend's recommendation.  I picked it up after our newborn was a couple of months old and wish that I would have read it before the baby came.  I thought there were several good tips in this book that I would have implemented sooner, had I read it earlier.
0553807919|5.0|This book is a must read for all parents! I really enjoyed this book and the suggestions it gave for raising balanced children. I liked all of the scientific research being explained in understandable terms, followed by explanations of how they apply to raising children.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I love the way the book flowed with enough hooks to keep the reader from wanting to stop. Dashner leaves audience on the edge of their seat wanting more without adding so much full memory is needed to continue. This book surpasses the \\"Hunger Games\\" in my mind because of the easily read and created characters which allowed one to visualize each scenerio. Wish Dashner would continue the series further.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the Twilight trilogy and thought that was good, until I read The Hunger Games.  The Hunger Games is an awesome book, there isnt a dull moment, will keep you wanting more!
B004LUS390|5.0|Solid 5 star recommendation. I picked this up as a freebie promotional on the Kindle Fire App Store, but would have paid the retail price after a quick run through the application. It has a wealth of features similar to the PC version. Only drawback is NOT on the application itself but perhaps on the technology it is designed to run on. Tablets (even with a stylus) just are not accurate enough to do fine artwork on such a mobile device. The performance of this app exceeds the devices it is designed to run on. So don't blame the app, the developer did a great job. I use it for simple sketches or a quick mock up of a design idea so I don't lose it to my vast cerebrum before I get a chance to get it to paper or other media. If you can pick it up for free, don't pass it up. If you have to spend a bit for it, don't pass it up. Just beware that it is likely the hardware that will limit your use of this app, not the app itself. Draw on dudes!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just as good as the other 2 books in the series, I am not much of a reader, but I couldnt put this book down!  Read it in 2 days!  My children are also reading the book and they love it.  Would recommend to anyone!
B002OT730K|5.0|I ask this because it is he, I think, that decides what gets released from the Stones' vault of unissued material. To Mr. Jagger I earnestly plead....  What makes \\"Love You Live\\" truly, truly great is side three, a.k.a. \\"The El Mocambo\\" side, the name of a small Toronto bar where the Stones did a two-night stand in 1977, billing themselves as \\"The Cockroaches\\", as I recall from the press at that time. (You're welcome to correct my details, Mr. Jagger, if need be). The Stones tear through four outstanding live numbers, namely, \\"Mannish Boy\\", \\"Crackin' Up\\", \\"Little Red Rooster\\", and \\"Around and Around\\", along with Mick Jagger's hilariously sarcastic introduction of each bandmate to a deliriously happy crowd of 2-300 fans, tops.  The songs are just the kind of tunes the band would cover when they were just beginning in 1963, in just such a raucous atmosphere. Fed by the small crowd's energy, the Stones' performance is singularly white-hot brilliant.  That, my friends, is exactly the problem. Thus my plea to Mr. Jagger: Where's the rest of it, please? Another of the band's great live records, \\"Get Your Ya-Yas Out!\\", got a deluxe re-issue not long ago. So why not release the complete El Mocambo Concerts on CD/DVD? We ardent Rolling Stones fans can only wonder, given how great the four \\"Love You Live\\" tracks are, what gems await us from those shows, not to mention the \\"benefit concert\\" that Keith Richards did in Toronto in 1978. (That's another story in itself).  Moreover, there are other \\"Stones-as-bar-band\\" goodies that could be included. Just one that comes to this writer's slowly-vanishing mind has the Stones joining forces with their idol, Muddy Waters, for a few songs at Chicago's Checkerboard Lounge in 1981. (*) Heck, there are two songs from that evening on YouTube already. Just imagine what other delights there are!  Please, Mr. Jagger, let us see and hear that which has for so long been hidden, Thank you! You needn't contact me, but I give Amazon the OK to forward to your management my contact info if you so desire.  (*) P.S. My late brother and I saw all the Stones' tours together for decades. (I still go). We knew of the band's penchant for playing Chicago's blues clubs the night before their stadium show. The night that they played the Checkerboard Lounge in '81, we'd decided to \\"go for it\\", but guessed wrongly and chose another blues lounge in error. Ironically, we were just a few doors' down from the Checkerboard.  As always, though, the \\"big show\\" the next day, (Rosemont Horizon), was only fabulous....Thanks, boys!
0439023491|5.0|Had to rush out and get Catching Fire right after Reading The Hunger Games.  Couldnt put it down, read it in 2 days and I am not a big reader!  I recommend this to anyone and all of my friends have read it too!

B0073LWEXK|5.0|The navigation back and forth did get tiresome. It would be awesome if the map could be used for navigation. But otherwise great game. Kind of myst like. Was sufficient in length for the price and the graphics are beautiful on my Toshiba thrive. Can't wait to see more from this dev!
B0073LJ61S|5.0|I'm a life-long VH fan. Like many others, I started playing guitar because of the great EVH.<br /><br />When I first heard \\"Tattoo\\" I wasn't real impressed. It sounds like a DLR solo song. But then I heard the rest of the album and it blew my head off. This is maybe VH's heaviest album. The band sounds great, Eddie's playing is on fire, Dave's voice sounds great, and assuming Wolfie played all his parts, he's doing things on the bass I never heard Michael Anthony do. No disrespect to Anthony - I do miss his high vocal harmonies.<br /><br />This is a very dense album. I've listened through it 3-4 times and am still discovering it. There's a lot going on here - lots of dynamics. Some of it a throw-back to the early days, and some of it very new territory.<br /><br />I'm glad to see the mighty Van Halen is back. A true breath of fresh air when there's not much hard rock getting airplay.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|It was cool when it worked, but now it won't even open. Doesn't even force close, just throws me back to my app drawer. Will email dev for a fix.
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|This isn't a terrible movie. But if you were expecting even a medium good movie, you will be disappointed. The movie mostly consists of painfully long camera shots of people doing not much of anything while bland, unrecognizable music plays in the background. The plot is weak and has major unresolved holes in it. The driving scenes are not spectacular. The most exciting car crack up is one where you know in advance the character is doing it on purpose for his job as stunt driver on a movie set.<br /><br />The romance could have been good, but again consists mostly of long camera footage while we stare at the actors faces. My family remarked that Ryan Gosling didn't have to memorize very many lines for this movie. Spoiler alert: The only time that the romance actually seems to be on track is a kiss on an elevator followed immediately by a particularly violent event on that same elevator.<br /><br />I hate giving this movie the lowest rating. I generally don't give poor reviews. However, I bought this movie because it had more than three stars and yet it was all I could do to stay interested enough to see it through to the end. That's just not a three star movie.<br /><br />There are so much better movies out there for your money. For example, I also bought In Time, which has a better plot, more driving action, a better romance, more complex characters, a fascination premise, good social commentary, and a story that will keep you riveted to the end. Yet In Time currently has a lower rating than Drive. I really don't understand the people who rated Drive with 5 stars and talk about Oscars. Are they working for the movie distribution company? Again, Drive is not a horrible movie, but its nowhere close to best in any category. Thus my minimal rating for Drive - save your money.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great on Kindle Fire. My favorite weather app. I love the different views and the radar lookout. I would definitely recommend this app.
B004SBBDB2|1.0|Great concept, no doubt. I was so hoping that I could send my iPad signal to our 32\\" tv or my 24\\" monitor, both of which have Component input jacks. I guess I got a defective cable because I got NO signal with the 32\\" tv, and I only got the red channel on the 24\\" Dell monitor. I re-checked my connections several times to no avail, and I think I know why its not working (jsyk, I've been doing A/V work and video editing for years, I'm very comfortable with how equipment gets hooked up): the cable that was used between the splitter and each individual RCA connector is so cheap it almost feels like string. There's no way this type of cheap wire could ever last even IF the one I was sent actually worked. If it did work and I was doing a one-time permanent installation and never pulling the plugs out again, it might fly. But the point of this AV cable is for portable use with an iPad, so for that application, I'm afraid it's a major FAIL. The odd thing is, the RCA connectors themselves are GREAT. They have nice fat covers making them sturdy and easy to grab, but the wire is so cheap... what a disappointment. I don't often give one-star ratings but in this case it was a bad choice of materials. Even a working one will fail way too soon. Nice idea, but I wouldn't go with this particular one.
B000X107GI|5.0|Batteries arrived as promised and it is working fine.<br />No problems so far.<br />I would definitely recommend buying.<br />Pretty satisfied.

0307352145|5.0|For those who dread, rather than anticipate, parties, crowds and other social events, \\"Quiet\\" will take you from \\"What's wrong with me?\\" to recognizing the complex social roles that the \\"shy\\" or \\"quiet\\" personalities play.  Like me, you might end the book wondering why the hyper-social, extroverted kids aren't the ones sent to the Resource Room; perhaps their behavior could be modified to be less loud, more aware...?    Susan Cain's premise is that introverts have always gotten the message that there's something about them that needs fixing - or they're failing to meet certain social performance standards. But \\"Quiet\\" suggests that while Americans (and the world) enjoy outstanding benefits from quiet people, we also pay a high price for under-valuing them. (From the book-- how different Bill Clinton would be if he'd been pressured to conform to a \\"Bill Gates\\" personality or Bill Gates had been required to be more like Bill Clinton!) One of the best aspects of this book is how Cain zings in on introvert-specific traits (the ones even introverts view as quirky or fringy or even disordered) and demonstrates how absolutely critical they are to our progress in the arts and sciences.    \\"Quiet\\" is an especially timely book with the diagnosis of Asperger's and debilitating shyness and other spectrum \\"disorders\\" on the rise (and being behaviorally modified). It's naturally written and authoritative but there's no need (much) to buzz over scientific jargon; it's the kind of writing that makes me feel smart.:-)  Cain makes a solid, entertaining argument that the introverted personality that we've all been conditioned to be concerned about, would be better off celebrated and cultivated. As an audio book, another 5 stars.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I have put off watching this movie up until last night.  After all the Oscar and Academy Award buzz, I decided to finally make the time to watch it.  This movie is very raw, captivating, honest, heart-wrenching, and irritating.  It's irritating because you want to reach out and strangle Miss Hilly and the rest of her simple minded guppy friends.  This film/novel stirs up emotions from the viewers and I very much enjoyed feeling each emotion.  The passive-aggressive racism in this film is something that everyone should watch and feel ashamed and humbled.  As a minority race, I do not feel like society has evolved much more from what is exemplified in this film.  No, there aren't shootings and public outbursts of racism (as much) but honestly, the hate is still here.  You might disagree but if you are not a minority then you are in no place to disagree, sorry.  Emma Stone is a talent to watch out for.  She is so real and so entertaining to watch.  She is not like a Blake Lively or Mila Kunis.  For some reason, I feel that she is going to be the Cate Blanchett of her generation.  Classy.  Extraordinary in every role.  As for Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, wow.  These are relatively unknown actresses that made me both laugh and tear up.  I hope Ms. Viola gets properly recognized for her performance this year.  Bryce Dallas Howard is great as well even though I hated her character.  I swelled with gratitude while watching the last scene she was in.  She got put in her place and was visibly shaken- AWESOME and DESERVED.  Great film.  I'm disappointed that I didn't read the book first.  Lately, I've been finding movies very ordinary and very boring.  This one has cured my entertainment drought.  5/5
B004GGM444|5.0|This is one of my new favorite records. Whether you consider it dubstep or not (I do), you have to acknowledge Skrillex knows how to make some of the cleanest dirty beats you've ever heard. Skrillex brings a more accessible verse/chorus/verse style which may alienate some, but I find to be appealing as someone who grew up listening to punk rock. \\"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\\" is a song that's been getting a lot of time on my playlist, but \\"Kill Everybody\\" might be my personal favorite. It's a brilliant juxtaposition of antisocial lyrics with a dance happy beat, and its break is so huge. Definitely a song that would get you pumped up while working out. \\"All I Ask of You\\" does a 180 and delivers a chill beat with a more sentimental vibe and female vocals. \\"Scatta\\" is another personal favorite.<br /><br />If I sound like I love this EP, it's because I do. Definitely worth downloading.
B002BWP49C|3.0|I watched this last nite, i can tell you that ive never read the books, only watched the movies and i draw my opinions from the entertainment value of whats infront of me.  I gain from other reviewers that the die hard twilight fans that have read the books may love the movie more, or be more critical or downright mad/disapointed, Im neither, Ive watched the entire saga with my family and \\"Breaking Dawn\\" had a few highs and low's  A point of intrest is there are a few scenes in the movie that you wont get or understand if you have not read the books, I only know this from reading others detailed reviews.  SPOILER ALERT.. your faired warned.  The part with the wolves talking was just awfull, bad CG, and the fact that this ability only shows up in this movie is a little hokie, Bella's walk with her dad down the Isle before she lays eyes on Edward was also Horrable, she looked like she was in pain, not mental anguish but real pain.. I also agree that the whole \\"sparkly vampire issue\\" is true, why dont they sparkle in this movie ? The lovemaking scene that these movies have led up to this point was a big letdown, im not asking for porn but they coulda done alot better. If you can get past this stuff and take the movie for exactly what it is and not what you want it to be if your a die hard fan you can get some enjoyment out of it, I put my feet up, got snacks and crashed on the couch.. I think the Overall acting in this last installment is better than previous twilight movies, there's less fighting action, and just more storytelling.. a few parts drag but overall its a fun popcorn movie to continue on with the Twilight saga. i gave it 3 stars instead of four becouse the parts of the movie that i commented on were BAD and truly brought my opinion down.. and tweaked my overall opinion of the movie. If the mentioned scenes were better/different i would have no trouble giving the movie 4 stars on entertainment value.
0545323126|5.0|I bought these for my seven year old daughter. She really enjoys the movies and wanted to read the books. She is in 2nd grade and it is a good way to encourage Chapter book reading. Before these she was \\"scared\\" of a book being to long....now she enjoys it! Great choice. They are entertaining for adults too :)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I'm no good at bagging IRL.  Don't know why I expected it would be better in-game.Yet, funnily enough, it is!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not really a reader - more of a movie person.  In fact, this is the first book that I've been able to complete in over a year.  While that should be compliment enough, I would still like to explicitly recommend this book to everyone. It is written simply but elegantly. Collins sucked me in and had me emotionally involved with the characters in this imaginative tale of survival and love set in a brutal world. I can't say much more than \\"simply fantastic\\". If you want to pick up reading as a new hobby, this is the place to start.
1400069289|4.0|The marketplace is getting saturated with books about why we think the way we think and why we do what we do- and this is an entertaining addition to the genre.<br /><br />This book is much stronger on research and  anecdotes than on putting the information to work for you. If you're looking for a more self-help oriented book on habit changes, this is not the one for you, but if you're looking for an easy and insightful look into the psychology of  habits, this is a good place to start.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|The songs are classics - well done and absolutely gorgeous.  Some of us are sick and tired of \\"modern\\" music, having a lifetime fill of it.  We long for the classics of yesteryear.  This cd fulfills all its promises.<br /><br />I heard Paul sing My Valentine at the Grammys.  I was shocked.  I didn't realize he was as sentimental a fool as I am.  This song is destined to become a classic and elevates Paul McCartney even further into the realm of treasured songwriters (as if he wasn't there before!).  I've read some criticisms of his voice here.  So he's getting older like the rest of us.  Yes our voices can wear a bit thin at times.  This only adds to the absolute charm of this cd, and besides, I find perfection boring.  That said, Mr. M still sounds wonderful!<br /><br />I highly recommend this cd to those of us who love the old classic songs, tinged with jazz and an element of beauty that can't even be put into words.  Every single song sounds superb.  How many albums can you say THAT about?<br /><br />Great job Paul and accompanying musicians!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I think one of the most intriguing aspects of Steve Jobs' persona is that he didn't fit into the \\"cookie cutter\\" mold of what today's society may think of when they say \\"CEO.\\"<br /><br />I actually did not care for the book until I was practically done with it.  The author does a wonderful job in weaving people and places within its pages and appears to conduct many, many interviews in order to accurately portray Steve's life.  My opinion of Steve did not start out positive but ended that way.<br /><br />I found the book to be inspiring and contains lessons about a great leader.  He followed his intuition, heart, and most of all, his dreams.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Although this is an excellent book, I'm very disappointed in the Kindle edition.  Aren't publishers editing books anymore? The First letters of words that start every chapter are missing!! For example.....chapter 12, should read \\"Bringing in a shrink was Jonathan's idea\\". Instead it reads, \\"ringing in a shrink, etc.\\". I give the book five stars for writing. It really is a good book. I give it two stars for editing.  At $12.95 for this kindle edition, it is VERY annoying. [[ASIN:B0050DIWFC Defending Jacob: A Novel]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game had lot of super tiny but fun games. the best one they made was in the 320,000. it was great
1594744769|5.0|i had bought this on amazon without hearing any reviews after it caught my eye in the store and was extremely and pleasantly surprised at how riveting this book was with this being Ransom Riggs first book!! I finished it in a days times and cannot wait for the second book to this series!!
B006YXTRHY|3.0|In the interest of full disclosure: I think the novel was awful compared to the previous three.  Based on things I had heard from others who had already seen it (and my opinion of the novel), I fully expected the movie to be terrible.  Maybe my low expectations going into it affected my perception, but it really wasn't that bad.  Some of the dialog was awkward.  The music was annoying (this was a problem with the previous 3 films too, but it's even more pronounced in this one).  Robert P's acting hasn't really improved.  But all in all, it was worth the $4.  The only part that was unbearable was the honeymoon scene.  If I watched the movie again, I would skip it.
B006C45CFG|4.0|If you're looking for an intelectual thriller... this is not the movie for you. If you're looking for something with awesome fight scenes and a pretty funny concept, this is a decent choice.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this app. great way to pass the time. I liked that we were able to get new apps at half the points.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|It's frustrating this book leaves you in what feels like the middle of a story.... hanging. There were so many characters and amazing detail in this book that I feel like I am ging to have to reread it prior to the release of the next one in the series. I liked it a lot, as the writing and story are so much fun, but it was the least appealing book in the series., hands down.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Ever since I first fell in love with Phantom over 20 years ago I've wanted this video!  I've seen the stage production 3 times, with three different casts, and have long dreamt of a version on film that captures the soul of seeing it on the stage.  After seeing Phantom staged at the RAH on bluray my hopes and dreams have been almost fully realized.  Pros:  -It heals the hurts caused by the soul-less Joel Schumacher version.  -The casting is fantastic!  The Phantom is great, but Christine and Raoul shine in their roles.  -The wide shots are great, capturing the unique digital backdrops and staging.  -Seeing a cast of over 100 performing Phantom is wonderful!  -The little additions to the music (using a full orchestra) are great.  -It is a great production, performed remarkably well, in a timeless setting.  -The curtain calls, and all the bonus stuff afterward, is wonderful Phan service!  Cons:  -It is still a stage production, so the visible presence of microphones and stage makeup will likely jar some viewers.  -The closer the camera zooms in, the more the digital backdrops look pixelated.  -Despite the fact that it is Phantom, it is not staged as you would see it done on Broadway.  Large props (the elephant) are left out entirely, and the chandelier does not actually fall.  As long as you expect a new interpretation of some of these things, it is not a con.  And if this film inspires you to see it on the stage as it was meant to be seen, it is a good thing!  Bottom line: if you are a Phantom Phan, this is a must have!  If you want to see Phantom, see it on the stage, then buy this Bluray.  If you don't have the opportunity to see the stage version, then forget about the hollywood attempt and just get this one!
0307352145|5.0|I can honestly say, that this book changed my life. It made me realize that I'm an introvert with a unique mindset and needs, not a second-rate citizen. Reading the book felt enormously liberating and opened up my quiet brain to an infinite number of possibilities. I gained new insights, understandings and strengths from this brilliant book. But I also learned about my family, how everyone is unique and have different needs based on their temperament.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\" made me appreciate both introverts and extroverts, realizing that it's through collaboration and not competition that we can change this world into a much better place. Life is a journey and this book made me a much better traveler.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I'm not sure what happened but this app used to work. great. Now everytime I start it up it crashes about 5 seconds and says force shutdown. Try something else until they fix the bug.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I is so great get so many games and buy them with coins. you earn so yes is the most awsomest game I have ever played 101 games you cant go wrong with that
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|My cousin suggested Matched to me \\"which I thought was weird considering it was mostly a girl book\\" but I am also interested in dystopia societies so I started reading it just for the political side of it and found it quite interesting...regardless of the obsession of a love triangle and which boy to spend her life with. I was more interested in going against the powers that be sort of thing. When I finished the first book...I wasn't completely sure if I wanted to continue onward with the second book to the installment of the trilogy...but since I had nothing else to read, I chose to continue otherwise. When I started reading Crossed, I thought it would be a little more disappointing than the previous one. It was at first...until you get even further into the book, where it gripped me more since there was not as much love and gooey stuff like that that obviously is not an interest to boys...at least normal ones. There was a lot more action than in the first one (if there was any) and seemed to grip me more as a guy than a woman on her relationship point of view. Sure there are some chapters that are all about kissing and lovey dovey stuff, but it isn't hard to ignore or skip it and get on with the action. When I finished, the first thought that came to my mind was \\"Wow. I can't wait to see what happens in the last book!\\" And I ask all of you to think the same thing when you finish. What will happen to Cassia, Ky, Xander and the Society? Only Ally Kondie will know...for now!!! :D
B005ELZKWS|4.0|pretty good but not as good as the first one and i m not sure why  ,its kind of like ,there is a lack of inspiration ,it feels pretty plain and maybe pushed towards \\"lets make some extra money\\"type filled album,even Joe is lacking power !as if he would not have a lot left ?!,i know he s got a lot more to offer!song #10 and #1 to me are more favorable than others!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I originally wrote in my review that the application wouldn't open. After being contacted by one of the developers, I tried uninstalling, rebooting my phone, then installing. This fixed my problems.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|As a public speaker I encounter all sorts of A/V set ups. I keep this device handy for when multiple projectors are being used.  It has enabled me to run a second projector when older projectors lack an ability to \\"daisy chain\\" or cascade the VGA signal back out to another device.  Can't beat the price.  I would prefer the \\"block\\" termination where the dual outputs exist to be two loose cords instead of an integral block but the encapsulation does reduced tangles and makes it overall smaller to transport than a typical \\"Y\\" type cord.  It looks and feels a bit klunky but it does its job!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I just loved this backpack for my camera accessories, nice size and the division inside is very versatile. Good price, great backpack.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I became aware of Lana's existence since the day she released her video for 'Born to Die', some of my friends were sharing it on Facebook. I thought it was weird at first, then it grew on me, and I ended up really liking the whole feel of it. Went on to hear Blue Jeans and Video Games which, in my opinion, were actually better than BtD.<br />So I began to anticipate the release of this album, and now, having just finished listening to it, I'm taken aback. It's AMAZING, exceeding my wildest expectations.<br />The other songs are deep, dark, full of a depth that is rarely found on pop music-- arguably music as a whole nowadays. I love it. It's easy on the ears, but impacts you at the same time. Right now I can't stop listening to \\"Dark Paradise\\", a haunting piece on lost love that should seriously be considered as a candidate for future single.<br />There's a reason Lana del Rey should be as much talked about as she has been of late, and that's not because of her family fortune, or her lack of 'dynamics' in live performances, or even because of her drop-dead-gorgeous looks. It's because of her MUSIC. This album won't be soon forgotten.
