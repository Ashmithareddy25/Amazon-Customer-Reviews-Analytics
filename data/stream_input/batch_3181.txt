B008JFUNJQ|4.0|Although now the space marine sub-sci-fi genre imagery from this classic will seem derivative of Halo & Aliens & Starship Troopers, this project  actually does the novel(s) justice. Pity they didn't go ahead and shoot two films back-to-back as planed though. Sir Harrison Ford is fab as Col. Graff, Ben Kingsley as war hero Mazer Rackham, Asa Butterfield as the titular Ender Wiggins. Ender is sent to The Battle School with Earth's young hopefuls to be trained in space warfare through tactical games in zero gravity in the Battle Room, beautifully rendered on screen, they captured those scenes nicely. Some filming & casting took place down here in New Orleans... They're still giving studios Post-Katrina tax breaks for filming down here, so there's always something shooting at least in part. They did a solid job, I approved of the HUGE cuts to Val & Peter's part in the novel, the Mind game bits are much better than I expected on screen. Overall I'd say a win for the adaptation, in spite of Card's own unfortunate personal beliefs in the non-fiction arena.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is even better than playing it on the computer.  The graphics are large and clear and it seems more straight forward
B0009HKH6Q|4.0|Steve McQueen is a Bored Boston Donald Trump with better hair and worse taste in women, sorry Faye. Tommy C is SO bored and SO rich that he robs a bank, and once he gets his back to the wall HE plans another HEIST. He just might get away with it and live happily ever after with the sexy insurance troubleshooter if the Feds don't catch him first. Beautifully shot, with quirky editing, filled with some darn distracting jazz tunes. McQueen Is awesome as usual but Dunaway is distractingly... less awesome.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|give it a try.it's pretty neat to play..most deff a keeper.plus the dragons are cute .have fun playing. thumbs up
B000SW4DXK|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas movies of all times and a tradition on Thanksgiving. I prefer the latest version for its colors and clarity...
B00915G6R6|5.0|We were a bit worried that the fourth season would not live up to the first three (3) but our fears were quickly allayed after watching a couple of episodes.<br /><br />Unlike many American TV shows this total cast can actually act. Unlike NCIS L A where the female lead is just embarrassing to watch to say the least.<br /><br />The ending for season four (4) of the Good Wife completely took us by surprise as were expecting somebody else to walk through the door.<br /><br />We originally started to watch the show because of Chris Noth but soon warmed to the whole cast.<br /><br />A great show with a good cast and some really good story lines.<br /><br />I heartily recommend it.

B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I loved this book. I was afraid that it would be another EPL (I loved that one too, but one is enough), but it is very different. EG has taken a historical novel and added some very modern and feminist touches to it. From a historical point of view, the book details the life of a girl, Alma, born into a wealthy immigrant family in Philadelphia. EG could have left it at that, but the fact that she makes Alma, live a very unusual life makes this book a thrilling adventure. Alma never has a family of her own, which sets her apart from most women at that time. Instead, she feverishly pursues science, and ends up as an equal to Wallace and Darwin. I loved the fact that EG placed her next to these two lads, in an attempt to show that, although they may have been less visible, women played a major role in science.

0393088804|5.0|Joe Sacco is a journalist and comic book artist.  Born in Malta, he is now a citizen of the U.S. living in Portland, Oregon. He has gained a reputation for reporting on some of the world’s top hot spots in the manner of a comic book style. He has written books on the Bosnian War, the Gulf war and the Palestinian situation.  This book, which I received a couple of weeks ago, is somewhat of a departure from his previous subjects.  It is a continuous drawing of the battle as it develops from the evening of June 30th to the evening of July 1st, folded concertina style into 24 plates (or pages). Beginning with Haig leaving church that evening it then shows in the minutest detail how the preparations for the battle unfold.  The initial bombardment by heavy guns, thousands of troops moving into position with horses, men, wagons and piles of munitions are all meticulously portrayed in line drawings. Night falls and leads to dawn as men take up their positions and prepare for the assault. When they start going over the top, Sacco correctly portrays the men with arms at the port as they expected little resistance. There then follow several pages of the battle … shells bursting … the men struggling to advance … falling, dying … dead. It ends with the return, the roll calls, advanced dressing stations and burial.<br /><br />His research of the subject was extensive. Having spent fifteen years in Australia before he moved to the States in 1978, he became fascinated by the Great War, especially of Gallipoli and the Dardanelles and it apparently never left him. He has amassed a large library on the war and he states in the forward that his inspiration for the work was influenced by the authors Martin Middlebrook and Lynn MacDonald among others.<br /><br />This is a fascinating work.  Its approach is probably unlike anything we have seen in this field. Despite this, it must be taken for what it is. Without a proper understanding of the battle, the book can do little to inform one of the chaos and horror of that day.  The depiction of the dead and dying soldiers cannot by definition be close to reality.  One unfortunate note (for me) is that Sacco chose to include an extract from Adam Hochschild’s book &#34;To End All Wars&#34;, which is a history of the pacifist/socialist movements during the First World War. Although he doesn’t distort the history, Hochschild trashes most of the British military hierarchy including, of course, Earl Haig. He dismisses the more recent reassessments of the Field Marshall and falls back on the old ‘butcher’ treatment.  I would have thought an extract from Martin Middlebrook’s  &#34;First Day of the Somme&#34; would have been more appropriate.<br /><br />Having said that, there is no doubt that The Great War by Joe Sacco will become an important and unique addition to the literature and iconography of this terrible war with which we will undoubtedly be bombarded in the coming five years.form one of the chaos and horror of that day.

B0051YKV4A|5.0|if you like Alice in Chains you will love this disc! you get almost all there best tunes and get to see them screw up a little too. and Laynes vocals are great and Jerry's aint bad either and the band sounds great. i only wish they would have done the song queen of the rodeo, i love that tune and it is so hard to find anywhere. i have only seen it on a live recording and Layne did it in the studio of a local radio station here in Seattle live on the air years ago and it was great.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wonderful - I've seen it 3 times and will go again!  First time was preview on Broadway with Kristen Chenoweth, other two times have been on national tour in Cincinnati and Indianapolis, taking grandchildren, who are now fans too (who are eager to go again!).  This one is a real winner for all ages.  The staging, costumes, and, of course, the music are all beyond excellent.  And the story line is engaging as well (not a requirement, but it helps to know the Wizard of Oz front story).  Even the souvenir T-shirts and sweatshirts are well-done, good quality, and worth taking home (be forewarned;  best to get to the theater early and purchase them before the show, in order to get the best choices in the sizes you want).
B007IXWKUK|5.0|more crap the wife likes and has all of. i wish i would have wrote it and became rich of this crap.

B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|great album with some really good tunes, but not as good as black gives way to blue but still solid.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A must read for those of us who can not help but remain ignorant regarding the rest of the world.  A must read for those who witnessed and suffered through 9/11.  I can not help but weep for these &#34;innocent&#34; people who are at the mercy of ignorance.  Do not blame it on religion. Blame it on the human condition which has not evolved sufficiently towards love and peace.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|the wife (and most women) love this crap. she has all of them and is was really entertained by them. and she had some wierd ideas if you know what i mean after reading them.

B00BHHIWQO|1.0|This game is an awful waste of time. The graphics are horribly old and look terrible. The game doesn't even make sense.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|Not &#34;real time&#34;. Hoped it would hook up like an Android phone but it doesn't. Not a bad learning tool however.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|This Concert is pure Entertainment at its Madjestic best.  It's produced more like a feature film than a concert.  The sights and sounds will keep you enthralled.

B00B1LN8WY|5.0|Glad I discovered this newer release set is widescreen as opposed to the original box set is full screen - less expensive & better for my TV!
B008KE3960|4.0|Played this for awhile. Some of it is hard to figure out but it takes some time to catch on. Fast action, cool air craft.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Fantastic and beautiful! Absolutely love the picture and musical as a whole! Definitely recommend this to any musical lovers out there!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Some of the games are close to impossible to complete. Makes me lose interest. Overkill on the difficulty of winning. The bird noises are cool.
0670024856|3.0|I've never been so glad to finish a book and the last 1/3 was a drudgery. This should have been two books. I loved parts of it but it became so bogged down it was difficult to remember what I loved about the first several hundred pages. Three stars is generous.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Other reviews would say, &#34;Not Bad&#34;.  I would say &#34;Not Good at All&#34;.  It is a remembrance of the original - no more.  If the second movie were 1/10th as good as the original, then this is 1/100th.  Don't spend more than a dollar to watch this.  If you pay more than you got robbed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it. The book was very exciting and I found that I couldn't put it down. Being a slow reader, I was captivated by it for several days.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very entertaining. Good plots & story lines. Acting is good. Enjoyed watching this series very much & looking forward to new seasons.
B00BPA2PDY|3.0|Barebones is about all you can say. They didn't even put the damn commentary track on the new Sony made for 4K release. Damn it! That is all I wanted. They are doing that and more for Robocop's upcoming release and they also have plenty of room on this 50Gb Bluray. I guess they didn't want to bite into their other version. The problem is that this version is only mildly better. Yes, it will more than likely force me to get it because bitrate is important but they could have at least given us the commentary.<br /><br />The other version has tons of extras and a slightly different color tone and bitrate. I mean slight. For those that need the best for 15 dollars you get the best at the moment. Inevitable native 4K release in 3 years I'd say. Choice is up to you. I have a hard time deciding as the other version is cheaper and still has a bitrate around 27 Mbps which is better than most Blurays already.<br /><br />Anyway, whichever version you buy this is an all time classic. I'm knocking off stars for being so barebones and expensive.
030758836X|4.0|pretty good book, it kept my interest, but the story line was pretty predictable. it is a good read to get for free from a library- not worth purchasing.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Awesome game. There is plenty of content so I hardly ever got bored. Whether it was exploring the depths of the Underworld with my pet hamster or destroying harpies with a thorn chakram, I always had fun playing this game.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Hey it's free how can you give it to bad of a review. It had some great suggestions for starting conversation. Did I read the whole thing? NO. But I skipped around around and got some nice suggestions.<br /><br />Reads well on my Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Successful people in life have to learn to communicate with others and strangers and you can get a few ideas here.
0316322407|4.0|Dear Malala,  I enjoyed reading this. I lived in Pakistan 3 years and was there when 9-11 happened in New York, and as the Taliban took greater and greater power over the coming years. Although some reviewers complained there was &#34;too much&#34; history, perhaps this book served as a vehicle to bring more of this information out to a world that cannot otherwise understand the historical background that makes Pakistan what it is today.  Nor do most people understand what is a real Pakistani, their hearts and souls and desires. They are truly inspiring to the world. So in that respect your book is doing an excellent job. I recommend it to others because it does provide some needed historical background about Pakistan and what led up to attack on you, Malala.

B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is very fun yet time consuming I love it and I'm sure you will too!!! So it helps if you need to pass time
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|It is fun and different. Got it because I like the zoo one which I keep resetting and replaying all the difficulties. The pictures are nice but I like animals better. Too many similiar balloons. One picture could have had a better job of editing.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I just installed this app and it says it stoped running and did it again when I tried 're downloading it can this be fixed or what<br />Not helpful at all
0804161380|5.0|High quality magnetic chest box! This is so gorgeous and would be an excellent gift for any Zelda lover!<br />Hurry and get your copy before they run out. Only 50k were made!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I was really into this at first. But then i got further up in the levels and I kept getting stuck. Its really no fun when there is no absolute way of completing the level to move on. Also, you loose lives or something, still not sure what they are, but you have to wait before you can finally play again. A plus is that it is not timed, usually, but you do have to earn a certain amount of points before you move on in a certain amount of moves. I hate that. That's part of the reason I couldn't move on because I couldn't  complete the goal. It is un enjoyable when you keep failing. I don't recommend it unless you are super patient.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Really fun but a little confusing in the menus but gameplay is great and I think u should try it
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|dark , intimate, funny graphic novella.....captures the inner mind of depression and neurosis.  good for dog lovers and those who work with kids and other human beings.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great read,LOVED the story and to think this could one day be reality! I am head-on out to the Pines.
B005DIAJO6|4.0|A good and affordable version of the classic.<br />It is a fascinating story that held the attention of my 8 & 9 year old grandsons. Despite modern videos and movies this old-time book was exciting to read to them. Followed up with watching the video version of the 1950's Disney adaptation movie, which was quite accurate in following the book.<br />This classic deserved a better print version than the cheap print job we got.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it, can't stop playing this game. So addictive. Having to fight with my girlfriend for the Kindle so I can play.
1451648537|5.0|Really a fascinating biography and well researched. This was basically commissioned by Steve Jobs in his lifetime but the author had the freedom to tell it like it was. An American success story showing how a genius can overcome personality flaws to become wildly successful. Despite being a jerk to people close to him and especially being harsh to people who worked for him, Steve Jobs was a revolutionary in American business. He managed and developed great new things for society but he fell short in sharing his success and fortune to improve the many needs of less fortunate people. The author timed the publication just right to coincide with the demise of his subject. A great read about an American business success story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was hoping for a different ending. I was expecting The Girl on Fire to lead the next generation and have a little more insight on the New Order.
0316219266|3.0|A fascinating story of how in America somebody can become rich and famous by developing a new way to sell, despite being a jerk.<br />It follows a long succession of American moguls who have built their empires by degrading their workers. A lot like the story of Steve Jobs, but not as well-written and not really well researched. But interesting nevertheless.<br />Instead of using vast wealth and power to help humanity and many important causes, this man is investing in private rocket ships and Texas ranchland.<br />Writing a biography of a successful person in mid-career and midlife is sort of an unfinished story.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|My only issue is the constant link to Facebook. Believe it or not, but, not everyone has a Facebook account or wants one.  There needs to be another way to connect to friends to get additional lives.
0671646788|5.0|One of my favorites.  I bought it for all of my leaders on my doTERRA team.  I Love this book, and you will too.
B000FC1KBG|5.0|Just what I needed to hear.  Read it before the baby came, and again when she was 2 weeks old...  Great advice!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|It's a really good game I would totally recommend it for your kids. And it's also good for the family.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a good read but I was left wanting more, more of everything conflict with Cato, conflict with the cousins and overall more development of there relationship a last it is just a romance story.  So I guess it works
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|My family has thoroughly enjoyed watching these precious original episodes. Great writing, hilarious special effects and Shatner over-emoting…what more can you ask for! We especially like the updated effects, which mostly apply to screen shots of the ship and planets. It is easy to watch either this or the original version but we prefer the upgraded look as it makes the planets look cool. The imagery is definitely cleaner and the colors more saturated. There is a very annoying image of a film camera that pops up when the scene enters the upgraded effect mode and this is distracting. Perhaps there is a shut-off buried somewhere but we haven't found it yet. It was also fun to watch the original pilot before Kirk. Good stuff for trekkie fans and those who have never watched the originals.
0385537131|5.0|Total Grisham. One of his best. A good opening and an unforgettable ending. Heart pounding and intense. I love visiting the south without having to go there. Highly recommended.

B003Z49LYO|5.0|Really interesting, but dark. Acting was terrific and the scenery was as much a part of the movie as the time setting.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I loved it on PC before, and now it's on the go! I'll spend several days just playing one map for over 100 rounds. Way more than the money paid!
B008JFUS0U|5.0|THE MOVIE:<br />Now, I am a lady who enjoys her some Thor. So this movie could be 20 minutes of him reading the paper and I'd give it 5 stars. That being said, it really is a great movie. Better than the first, I'd say. I felt the first movie had more character development and set up (ie nothing really happened). This movie definitely had more action, but the interaction between all the characters, particularly Thor & Loki, was what made great.<br /><br />I have watched this movie over a dozen times (I play it in the bkgd while I work) and it makes for great company. Some standout moments for me are:<br />The music<br />The acting (except for Jane, she just doesn't fit for me)<br />The costumes<br />The plot (I'm not a technical nerd, so any holes are lost on me)<br />The levity (some very funny moments)<br />The Thor (Gratuitous shirtless scene!)<br />The funeral scene. I find myself watching this every time. It's just very well done. Beautiful.<br /><br />As popcorn-muncher flicks go this movie was a pleasure. Remember to stay tuned after the credits - TWICE - for extra content!<br /><br />THE DVD:<br />I'm not one to be suckered in by extra discs and downloads, and the standard DVD edition is perfect for me. Could be cheaper, though!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Loved it....  Must believe in true platonic love between two people.  Great movie to watch several times to find deeper means.  Dan T

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|this app is great! I have it on my kindle and my andriod phone. this app works great on getting rid of the junk files. I would reccommend this app for everyone.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Being a big fan of Superman, I was looking forward to this new movie, especially after seeing the great job that was done with the Batman movies in the last few years. When this film started my hopes were being met, since I encountered a very nice setup to the story, and I was appreciating the nice blend of original story with a some new elements and a very imaginative depiction of Krypton.<br /><br />The beginnings of the story in Earth was also good, with Clark discovering his powers and learning about where he came from, the relationship with his parents in Earth, and the fear of being discovered, while at the same time having the need to help others. But sadly, this is when thing start to go awry.<br /><br />The confrontations with General Zod and his group are a big part of this film, and here I felt that they decided to put the story in second place and focus on special effects. It may be cool when you see the first building collapse, or huge explosions take place, but after seeing this over and over, things get old pretty fast. I'd rather see a fight between Superman and Zod, than see one hit the other, five building collapse one after the other, going back to the fight for the next hit, etc.<br /><br />Overall this was an OK film, but it definitely did not meet the high expectations I had. A clear test for me is when I think about which movie I'd rather see, this one or the one from 1978, and in my case the answer is that I prefer the old one. Therefore, it is clear something went wrong in the way they decided to create this new film.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|I suggest this game for the hard core or casual gamer. Awesome game this is a good combo pack with iron man.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad there is finally a Candy Crush app for my Kindle. It was nice to be able to link it to Facebook, so my progress was not lost. My only complaint would be that it seems to freeze up, or need a moment to catch up sometimes. Other than that, love it!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Works really well for its purpose. There are clearly better Lavalier mics, but not for the price. Its great for clipping on my shirt while recording vlogs. The wire is really long and is hard to conceal at times, but that's the only real downside I've found

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Well written, interesting and witty. Should be required reading for all Americans especially for those who have loved ones on the inside.
B000WCDI64|5.0|Amazing! So glad to have her music to listen to. Wish she had been able to hang on and get it together.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|It was fast moving, just when you thought you had it solved, another problem came up.  Interesting ending!  It also gave me some insites in the trail procedures (don't care if they are real or not, just reads good).
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|I HAVE ENJOYED DISNEY FILMS FOREVER. THEY DID VERY WELL ON THIS FILM. JUST LIKE CARS, EXCEPT WITH PLANES.<br />HOPEFULLY THEY MAKE IN 3D.
B00EEL0LGY|4.0|The game is simple and relatively fun, but I can see it getting boring quickly. There is no multiplayer, as there is with the iPhone version, and playing against the A.I. is only fun for so long... I guess you can play online, and it compares your times against others, but you can't invite friends to a private race. On top of that, upgrades and new vehicles are pretty expensive, and there would be no way to get them without spending actual money in IAP. Even if you played long enough to save the in game cash for a decent vehicle, you'd be completely bored with the game and have to repeat levels a significant number of times. As with all new racing games, throttle is automatic, but you control breaking (which is hardly needed), a boost function, and can do tricks (which you learn each time you level up, and refill your boost if landed) by swiping your fingers in various directions on the screen (a trick list is available).<br /><br />It reminds me of the old N64 game \\"wave race\\" :). The graphics are decent (not as good as NFS MW, but still ok), and you can customize the vehicle and rider colors, which is nice. It's entertaining for a while, and well worth $1. If you enjoyed wave race or other such games, you'll probably enjoy this one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this item, it brings my Netflix Movies, YouTube, Laptop Chrome Browser, and Google Play Music right on to my TV. It's an easy set up with no hassle, the instructions are right on the box when you open it. Overall it's a great product. The kids will love it and it's a great Christmas gift!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If you like games where it requires check ins you will like this game while you are off you may be attacked and have to go make up the lost points it gives you something to do.
B003O86FMW|5.0|How refreshing thus series is, what an excellent reminder that courage can free the poor and the aspiring from the greedy and repressive.  We need such treatises.
B00FATEJYE|1.0|I really wish I hadn't tried downloading this, doesn't want to do it. Mistake, avoid the tomfoolery, and save your mind.
B005ORVN1Y|3.0|I'm happy to report that the Rush Sector 3 CD box set is a decent addition to my Rush collection. The packaging for this box set is in the same format as the other two Rush Sector sets, which is to say that it's nice but not overly elaborate. As far as the music goes, the biggest improvement here has to be Signals, which has finally been remastered so that it actually sounds good...too bad it took 30 years to get there. On the other hand, if you're not already into 80's era Rush, this collection probably won't appeal to you. While there's certainly enough solid material here, the heavy emphasis on keyboards and synthetic-sounding drums (coupled with the steadily declining contributions of Alex Lifeson's stellar guitar work) makes this collection less enjoyable than the previous two Sector sets. Personally, I still think Signals is a pretty strong recording and Power Windows is a good effort, but to me some of the other material sounds dated and irrelevant. And while the new remastering job by Andy VanDette is well done, in some cases the sound quality isn't anything special (Grace Under Pressure sounds flat and slightly muddy, and A Show of Hands is pretty wimpy in both sound quality and song selection). After careful examination, Power Windows gets the nod for being the best sounding CD in this set (I suspect this is in part due to the quality of the original recording, which sounded very crisp to begin with). Signals is much improved, and while not quite at the level of Power Windows, it's better than any other version I've heard. Hold Your Fire actually sounds pretty good too, but to be perfectly honest, it's a tough listen these days...I would classify it as over indulgent, especially when you compare it to classics like 2112 or Moving Pictures. And I really wish this set had included some unreleased rarities or alternate versions of existing songs, but that wish goes for ALL the Sector sets. Still, I'm a collector, so it's always nice to complete a run...it's just too bad that this third set in the Sector trilogy couldn't have had a little more to offer.

B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I have typically loved everything Patricia Cornwell has written in the past. However, I believe Cornwell using (there is not other word for it) the Sandy Hook mass shooting in her story is completely without taste, without compassion, and quite frankly, has ruined her writing for me. I doubt I will ever purchase another of her books. I have yet to be able to even read half of this book (when normally I finish her books in hours) because not only is it disjointed, I HATE that she is making money off the deaths of innocents.
0375842209|5.0|Terrific novel that carves new ground in the over-crowded genre of 'Holocaust Fiction'.<br /><br />Difficult to write a 'fictional' novel about such a real, tragic event --- but Markus Zusak has done the near impossible by penning an equally heart-warming and horrifying novel with THE BOOK THIEF.  Narrated by death (who has some very eerie insights into human nature) the story of Liesel Memminger, young Jewish girl adopted by a German family and growing up in a small German town in near secrecy is impossible to put down.<br /><br />I read in a newspaper recently (the terrible Long Island Newsday) that this story was the rosiest depiction of WWII since &#34;The Sound Of Music&#34;.  How ignorant can you be?  With more than half of the characters dying in horrific manner I find comments like that reprehensible.  Plus, I don't remember Death hanging over Julie Andrews shoulders as she sang: &#34;The hills are alive...&#34;<br /><br />The movie is very good but only scratches the surface of this wonderful novel about hope, family, tragedy and the power of the written word.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun game I play with my two little girls just wish there was a way to get coins and crowns faster
0071762345|5.0|I wish more marketers shared Dave Kerpen's philosophy of providing value content and attracting customers versus sticking advertising in our faces. I know there is a second book that might deal more with video and photo versions of Social Media; I'll have to che4ck it out and see if that is true. I hope that following the suggestions in this book works as well for me, since being the blabbermouth at the cocktail party is just not my style. Thanks, Dave. Great Read!

B001NLKXK2|4.0|Such an engrossing read.  Would highly recommend it and other books by Genova.  It's not long drawn out on details or diagnosis, but the story is just fascinating with enough medical info to help you understand.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|So far it works as advertised.  Slightly slow load time on kindle.  Easier to use so far compared to earlier versions.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Interesting background plot but not as much a cliff hanger as some of his other books which I've enjoyed more.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|At the age of 86, this is the most informative book I have read about Jesus of Nazareth, the son of man. Extremely well  researched and thoroughly grounded, it offers the curious reader clear and logical explanations to the many puzzling twists and turns in the life of Jesus.<br /><br />This is not a book on the religious teachings of Jesus, but on the historical events and times of his life and his role in them. However, understanding the times will enable the reader to better understand the Christian religion.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is an excellent comedy musical story that reflects the wonderful cast who make this a memorable and enjoyable film.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|my little sis loves this game almost everytime she gets on my kindle she plays this game!!! although it locks stuff up she still really likes it. I'm not that fond of it myself but that's only because I'm a tom boy but if you have a little sis you should so get it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I'd just like to know what genius--and I use that term in the most sarcastic way possible--came up with the idea of automatically filling in the names of people on one's Friend list when one tries to type in a word just because the word happens to share the first few letters as the name. And getting it to go away is no easy feat! If there's a way to disable that, would someone please let me know? It's a colossal nuisance!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Excellent Bond, creepy-crazy villain, and the introduction of Q make this a great addition to the Bond lore. Judi Dench holds her own with Daniel Craig expertly.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book threw me at first. The intersection of lives and circumstances is interesting and does make you wonder, &#34;what if?&#34;...<br />I like Ms Moriarty's perspective on family and marriage.
B000089RV6|4.0|This album should be available as an MP3 Download. Amazon, you can do better that give us a bunch of tribute bands in place of the real thing
B00EE3KMOI|2.0|Sadly, this series is bloated, bland and not worth the ridiculous amount of time it takes to get to a highly implausible ending.  David Tennant is wasted in a dull one-note role.  Some of the other actors are quite good, but their excellent performances are undercut by heavy-handed camera work and a mind-boggling amount of slo-motion.  (We got to the point where we just started fast-forwarding through the pointless slo-mo, lingering views of the sea and montages of each member of the grieving family.)  There is a moment of genuine emotion and tension in the first episode in which Beth is shown in silent slo-mo running to the beach. After that, the slo-mo is just an obvious device to stretch what should have been no more than 4 episodes into 8.<br /><br /> As a view of small-town life, it really doesn't show us anything we haven't seen before. Yes, we get it.  The seemly tranquil small town harbors all kinds of secrets.  Other films and series have done it much better.<br /><br />As a detective story, the series is particularly frustrating largely because there isn't a lot of detecting going on.  The detectives sort of stumble from one suspect to another, never bothering to follow up on obvious leads until the 7th episode.  Another annoying problem is that series can't seem to settle on a coherent time line.  We are told in the later episodes that nearly two months have elapsed (with VERY little to show for it on the detection front) and yet the detectives are still asking people if they saw the dead boy \\"in the last month.\\"  Important decisions that have been resolved in one episode are treated later as still unresolved, even though the time that has elapsed would have rendered the decision moot.  (Also, if a CCTV tape loops over itself, erasing earlier footage with later footage to save on tape, why is the earlier footage still available to the detectives, but not the later?)<br /><br />Among the many other annoyances that seriously undermine the series are littlethings like Tennant's facial hair.  How is it that this man, who we are to believe cares little for his personal appearance, carefully trims his neck and beard to exactly the same degree of scruffiness for 8 weeks?<br /><br />In short, don't bother.  Or, if you decide to invest the time, keep your finger near the fact-forward button so you can skip thorugh all the filler.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought the movies were good, the book is amazing! I couldn't bring myself to put it down! Ready for book two.
006202406X|1.0|I'm disappointed. And believe me when I say I could let a lot of flaws slide, but this book takes the cake. I won't write a lengthy review because I'm sure plenty of other reviewers have already said everything. Mrs. Roth's story-telling was superb in Divergent, almost as good in Insurgent, but just lacking in Allegiant. What a let-down. I feel like I wasted my time reading the trilogy.
1401307450|4.0|I've read a few of these rock star books and this one started out with the usual chicanery. Keidis comes off like a bit of a blowhard at the beginning of the book but the more you read you start to have some sympathy for his situation and it really picks up steam about mid-way in
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book stands as my current favorite - as soon as I finished, I wanted to start again to reread it.<br /><br />I am a huge Brandon Sanderson fan, but I will say that there are very common threads in the characters and magic systems between all of Sanderson's book; therefore, I think the enjoyment of this book might depend on which of Sanderson's books you may have read before.<br /><br />I had only read (what was at the time) the Mistborn Trilogy, Legion, and Emperor's Soul when I read The Way of Kings, so everything seemed very new and unique.  After reading Steelheart and the Alcatraz series, I feel like I might have liked the Way of Kings slightly less (4 star!).
B00FN5Z8UY|5.0|I love it!!! It has been great, I love The Walking Dead. It's the best show ever and I hope it never ends
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|It's a super fun game but it takes forever to load but overall I give it four stars...hope you enjoy it

B00GH4RKYM|3.0|It's super mediocre. There is no reason for the matrix baby backstory, nor for Zod's desire to terraform earth. There is no inspiration at all. Kevin Cosner spends every scene contradicting himself before being enveloped by a the first tornado to not pick up and throw people. The ending isn't that spectacular, and neither is the story leading up to it. Watch the fight scenes, then stick your fingers in your ears for 2 hours.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I guess I needed to read the fine print a little more before purchasing this.  I mostly watch amazon movies and it really doesn't work very well for it.  There was a delay in the audio and could not even watch pbs on it from the computer.  I would stick with app driven dvd players or smart tv's instead of this device.
B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|To be fair, the only reason I chose not to headline this as the best movie of 2013, is because I have not yet seen American Hustle, The Wolf Of Wall Street, Saving Mr. Banks, and I think even Out of The Furnace may get some attention. But today is a day I will remember for quite awhile. Here is my review for the movie 12 Years A Slave.<br /><br />This movie introduces us to the historical figure Solomon Northup (played very memorably by Chiwetel Ejiofor). He is a well known player of the violin, and he is soon happened upon by two men who convince Solomon to join a circus to perform. Unfortunately, things go from bad to worse quickly and soon after, Solomon is a slave.<br /><br />12 Years A Slave does so many things right that you almost forget that it is a movie. Michael Fassbender has really outdone himself with this movie. His character Edwin Epps, is the definition of sadistic evil. Michael Fassbender acted the role so well, I had to remind myself several times he's just acting. It is sad to see how his character tries to justify his harsh treatment of \\"his property\\" with the bible, but thankful for the characters like Benedict Cumberbatch's(yes he is in this movie) character Mr. Ford that sees that these people are humans just like the rest of them.<br /><br />How great the story is would be a summary of how I feel about the movie which is one word: Miraculous. I can go on and on about how great the actors/actresses are in the movie, but the story and direction are just as great. And with that being said, I agree with every positive review that has been said on Amazon(and in general) about the movie 12 Years A slave. Because without a shadow of any doubt, 12 Years A Slave, be it that it is a heart breaking, depressing re-telling of slavery in America, succeeds as film of hardship and courage. The Oscar race has just gotten tougher and I would not be at all surprised to see this movie win multiple awards including Best Picture of the year. Yes, 12 Years A Slave is a great movie, and yes you should definitely see it.<br /><br />5 Stars<br /><br />Starring: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Brad Pitt, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulsonis a great movie, and yes you should definitely see it.<br /><br />5 Stars<br /><br />Starring: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Brad Pitt, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Michael Fassbender, Sarah Paulson
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I love it when the bad guy is a she.  And Reacher could care less what the sex is of the bad guy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think its a very!good game becuaes you get to build and you have all of the difernt bloks and you can build a portel to the nether
B00E9A656K|4.0|Fun game, lots of action! Just wish there were some American brands included in the array of cars to choose from.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is wonderful!  Great characters, great costumes, great story line.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching all three seasons on Amazon Prime.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|The Death Cure was not everything I hoped it would be. There are still many critical questions left to be answered, and I had expected more of the finale. I suppose it's worth finishing the series if you've read the first two, but I believe so much more could have been done with this third and final installment.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My kids love the graphics and the interaction with the horses. Just wish items didn't cost so many gems. Would recommend.
0385537131|5.0|It is by far Grisham's best work to date.  He is truly one of the greatest authors of our times.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I think that injustice gods among us is one of the best games created.I like how you can unlock skins in the Mobile game and link your WBID account to your console and  get them.The skins that you can unlock is batman beyond ,arkham city harley Quinn,nightfall bane,New 52 green lantern,and prison superman.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game EVER!  I have it on my phone, kindle ad PC.<br />I can't stop playing ...this game makes you think,
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The packaging and was excellent and the device works as advertised... No complaints (there's always room for improvement, so I never give 5 stars)
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I played it on the pc ages ago but forgot the name of it, so I knew I had to get this app. You should too, you won't be let down.
0740785508|5.0|This book offers very clear, and well-illustrated, lessons about ways to make things that don't exist look realistic in a painting.  The book is VERY well done, and I think anyone like myself, who paints and draws, will find that it's a reference they refer to again and again.  Gurney is very generous to share so many of his techniques.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|The additional scenes in the movie are great, but the 3 discs of special features are utterly fantastic. This is a necessary addition to the collection of any fan of Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-earth.
B008JFURII|4.0|Not as good as the original, but it has its moments. The action was good, but it lacked something that the original had in spades.
B000FGGERC|5.0|I love Opeth when they are not doing death vocals. I realize the long-time fans probably hate this, but Mikael has a wonderful regular voice and it is truly amazing that he has such a range and I have become appreciative of that much. However, I still prefer non-death vocals. That being said, this is an excellent album. It is much more prog than metal. This is my second favorite, with &#34;Heritage&#34; being first. Both of which have nary a death growl…well, unless you count that little one at the beginning of &#34;Slither&#34; (on Heritage).
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Even more lovable than the first movie. And funnier, if that is even possible. I was laughing so hard at the ending scene my kids were getting embarrassed. This is one of those movies you can watch over and over, it never gets old.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|I just enjoy watching this movie even though I've seen reviews that it wasn't that good. In this case, I could care less about the reviews...
B000JCSBU0|2.0|This is a movie that is very hard to like, let alone sit through. It's like those movies film majors make for their senior theses— Dark and Artsy with an Important Message. I admired the actors though— they give it their all, and you can tell they went through hell to make this movie. I just know I went through hell to watch it. I guess the message is Say No To Drugs, but I didn't find the whole premise believable enough to be truly moved. The kind of horror these characters experience seems more like something one would experience in an Artsy Movie, not in real life.
B00F2HW20M|2.0|A great album for steve Hackett but for people who first discovered Genesis in the Peter Gabriel/Phil Collins days and they were playing in movie theaters forget it.  This album is for Genesis late comers who probably discovered them after The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. Great Steve Hackett album but not Genesis. If Hackett was so concerned about keeping the old Genisis around what was he doing the entire time Collins was making his presence well known? He sure did wait a long time. A better name would have been Hackett decides to bring back the old Genesis a few too many years late with members missing.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|This is one of those dumb action movies that also wants to make a Statement. And the Statement is this: Our real enemy is not Al-Qaeda. It's those gun-wielding rednecks from Duck Dynasty. Or any White Republican Male with a Gun or a Grudge, or both. Or anyone who disagrees with Obama…I mean… President Sawyer… about removing troops from the Mid East. You might lose track of the Statement, however, once Channing Tatum gets down to his undershirt. And he somehow manages to escape being hit by people with machine guns standing ten feet away from him. But the bad guys are always such lousy shots, besides being completely stupid and insane and Republican. On the plus side, Jamie Foxx is always fun to watch, even when he has a terrible script. And Tatum is fun to watch—period. Just don't let him talk too much. The guy needs subtitles. And he's supposed to have an 11-year old daughter? When did that happen? When he was, like, 14? James Woods does his best, trying to make sense of his character. He's a truly great actor. But even he couldn't save this whole movie from going down with the White House.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is a great device!  Its clearly a work in progress though as the available apps are limited.  I purchased the Chromecast as a second streaming device to an Apple TV (i.e. to bring a 2nd TV online).  I wanted it for Hulu Plus, and Netflix usage (and maybe Casting my Chrome browser).<br /><br />This device is easy to set up...and gets going really quickly.  The power chord is about 3' long...so it will fit in most places.<br /><br />I'm a big Google fan...but this device at this point in time is not up to the same level as an Apple TV.  So don't expect that.  If your looking for something that will throw Netflix and Hulu Plus on a TV...then this is your device.  I'm sure it will grow into itself in the not to distant future.  It is more than appropriate for the price though...when comparing it to the Apple TV
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|It's amazing how silly these comic book movies get when they try to sound smart. I miss the old days, when comic book movies were, well, comical. Now they are all dark and brooding and overly complex. And the budgets are so big you spend a half an hour watching whole cities be annihilated, and no one even bats an eye. The script of Man of Steel seems to have been written by a roomful of romance novelists with maybe one guy shouting &#34;blow something up!&#34; in the background. It was pointless and silly. What is Amy Adams doing in this movie? She didn't seem to know either. And Diane Lane? Kevin Costner? And Russell Crowe for goodness sake!!! The plots meanders around crazily until you have no idea what day it is. Or what is going on. Superman is supposed to be devastated by the part he plays in destroying Krypton forever, but honestly, I can't even say the word &#34;Krypton&#34; without giggling, so who really cares? Trying to assign Deep Motives to Superman is like trying to put a tutu on a hippopotamus. You just make the hippo look even sillier than it already is. Not that I wouldn't mind seeing Henry Cavill in a tutu.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great! I can see it prefect. I love the HD quality. Its a great movie to watch on the go.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|I admit I only watched this because Brad Pitt was in it. Somehow I thought this fact would make the movie more intelligent or interesting. But it didn't really happen. Like most movies of this sort, you become anesthetized to the killing and violence to the point that it doesn't even matter anymore. The emotional connection is gone, and you just have to wait around for the wrap up. This movie has some good tense scenes, like the chase scene in the lab, where it tries to build some tension, but that can only happen when you feel some empathy for the characters about to get annihilated. Remember &#34;Aliens?&#34; I wish every director who wants to make a zombie/alien/superhero movie would watch that one and see how it's done.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|A great dystopian novel with cunning plot twists. I've really enjoyed the first two books and am looking forward to moving on to the third.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have been looking at the Chromecast and when i saw it on sale at Best Buy it was an easy decision. It is so easy to use! I used to only be able to watch Netflix on one TV,  now it's easy to watch in any room. And I love being able to watch YouTube videos on my TV. It's worth it just for Netflix,  but I can't wait to see what is added next to this great little device.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The idea is awesome.  The price is great.  That said, it wasn't as easy to set-up as the follow along directions make it seem (things just weren't doing what they were supposed to do until the 10th or so attempt at doing the same thing).  Also, when watching Netflix, the video keeps having to buffer throughout the movie.  This could be blamed on network connection but I do have a great high speed Apple router and very rarely experience problems.  In my opinion, Apple TV works better at this point.  Maybe the next generation of ChromeCast will be better
1878424777|5.0|I loved both the book and the CD. It has given me the understanding of what it means to love oneself and to shine your light on others so that they may find themselves too. We all have the ability to be successful and to be what God intended for us to be. Taking the Four Agreements and integrating them into my life is going to be quite the adventure and learning experience.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I loved this game on Facebook, I was glad to see it for kindle fire HD.. good graphics good story great way to pass the time!!

B0037RDPEG|5.0|Every woman will be able to relate to Gilbert's experience. The pain of a difficult break up, the struggle to recover the self and finally the joy of love re-discovered. Many will envy her free spirit and her determination to re-discover her identity and find a new way of being after the grief of love gone wrong.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I am not the type of person that needs a happy ending, however I was so disappointed with this book! I absolutely loved the first two books however the last one seemed boring at times, over political at others, and rushed way to much in others! The catch 180 at the end of the story had me extremely upset. I found it in poor writing and ironic that a member of dauntless would forget a gun......on a suicide mission?????? Ummm made no sense...I did  cry like a baby as I fell in love with that character in the first two books! So I am left upset and confused at the end of this trilogy! I am so disappointed to feel this way! I kept waiting for it to.be revealed that the character was actually alive!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved the overall message of the story. The book was really good. Some parts seemed a little slow, but the end was really exciting and surprising.

B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I had high hopes for this series, but it was really boring at parts. The concept of really fun, but overall it was too slow paced for me.
B00EO87RIW|5.0|Saw the film in Paris, in june this summer. I consider it a new &#34;La dolce vita&#34;, somehow inspired in that film, and Fellini's art, and very much the film of Rome and its society today. A great film, in my opinion. And the photography is also excepcional!
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves this set.  He has already watched it multiple times.  It looks awesome on our 55' TV
0140177396|4.0|I am a ESOL student and when I first saw the book the title sparked a curiosity in my mind. While studying the chapters I have noticed that the author begun the novel with positive beliefs toward his characters, and unexpectedly the inevitable happened. The only thing that I don't  like at this book is the informal reading/words, because for foreign students is hard to understand the meanings, however, I very recommend the novel because is a very qualitative book.<br /><br />Gulerez, Daniela
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I like the characters, how they interact and how they look out for each other.  Am looking forward to Season 2.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|With death as a narrator, I was not sure what to expect, but I feel in love with Leisel and her story.  Terrible circumstances and terrible times,  made the small yet important likenesses in this story shine.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Can't miss with this classic movie.  We love it.  Nice to keep forever and ever and ever and ever. Done.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Have to say I was disappointed...had read other books on heaven really lifted up and glorified Jesus. This one did not
B00EKR61FM|5.0|Love the keepsake box & picture book that the discs are in.  You get all the movies, all the extras, and Ultraviolet copies!
B009NUV0E8|1.0|First I want to say that the one star review if for the Blu-ray transfer and not the movie. I love Goldeneye and think it's Pierce Brosnan's best outing as Bond. This Blu-Ray transfer is beyond terrible, It's loaded with DNR & edge enhancement. Projected on a big screen it looks like total garbage. This transfer was the one they used for the FIRST DVD which is inexcusable! They messed up the HD transfer for the remastered DVD when that came out so instead of striking a new and correct transfer for the Blu-Ray, they recycled the master for the *first* DVD. The word LAZY comes to mind.
0545265355|5.0|What a great trilogy!  These are all books you just cannot put down!!!  I've read them several times and they get better each time.  Collins is such a great writer & really lets you use your imagination.  So exciting to see the books come to the big screen, can't wait for the last two movies!
0385350864|2.0|Loved the first book. It was touching, as well as funny, with rich characters and left you rooting for Bridget. I read it years ago and remember enjoying her fumbling, insecure quest for companionship.<br />I tried to like this. Oh there are parts that are tender, her grief overwhelmingly realistic. I just couldn't take all of Bridget's insecurities. What was endearing at 20, becomes irritating at 50. Surely, after being married to such a paragon, something would have worn off. Was this a book about grief and loss, or a book about life not having a happy ending, or was it about Bridget rediscovering herself? I wish Fielding would have picked one and worked it rather that the confusing mismash of someone who never fit in, and never grew up.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Fun game to play looks great love the different types of lands and armor again love to play this game.
0399160450|4.0|Another Clancy book written to be made into a hit movie.  Too bad he is gone.  He will be missed.
B007ME5BUG|3.0|A decent chronological summary but the author writes in stream of conscious fashion, frequently without topic sentences for paragraphs, very often assuming readers' foreknowledge of names and places, and with some but not nearly enough maps interspersed - I often had to stop reading in order to check Wikipedia on specific places, battles and topic because the author chose not to furnish a coherent background explanation. Many passages with needless detail could have left out and explanatory analysis included instead.
0670024813|3.0|Not Diamond's best work to date, but it does make you think about how the western, develped world has missed the mark in a lot of ways.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i have had for 1 or 2 years.  i have loved it , and i  highly recommend  this game for any one.  i hope u love it.:) :) :) :) :) :) :):)=)=)=)=)=)=)=)=)=)=)
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|So far it is just as good using this app on a tablet as it is using Google on a PC.
0812416503|2.0|I barely made it through this book. It comes so highly recommended, I can't really imagine why. The author writes long tedious descriptions of trees and flowers throughout the book which literally made me scream and almost throw the book away half way through. The best part is the ending, which I will admit had a nice twist (and a relief because it was over).<br /><br />Quality: This printing is awful. It is a tiny little book that resembles a cheap romance novel and it made me feel awkward reading it in public.<br /><br />Pro: I can now speak on the topic of this book when it is brought up in conversation.<br />Con: I want my time and money back.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It is a fun post-apocalyptic story where the good guy (girl) wins and the silly looking bad guy loses. The acting is good, but not great. The tortured acceptance of the heroine's position isn't accompanied by a rage that validates her actions. Her reluctance to kill is laughable. In a real situation, killing anyone who was responsible for her family's/villages situation would have been cathartic for the character and the audience.<br /><br />Looking forward to the sequel.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|Overly long book! i was bored as the story dragged on and on. Theo, a junkie and a drunk inspired no sympathy.  One wonders why he managed to stay alive.  Big waste of my time.
B008EQIK90|2.0|Stupid premise, badly acted, direction was non-existent. The actors are a poor choice for the roles... or any roles outside of a Disney afternoon sitcom.
B0029VUV70|5.0|Excellent movie! Amazon keep surprising us with great choices for prime users. Great story about humanity, circumstances, choices, knowledge, and that voice in our heads. Nudity - not a family movie.
B0000AGQ6Y|5.0|One of my favorite pictures ever. The international version is better than U.S. version. It shows more of the relationship aspects between Jean Reno's character and young Natalie Portman's character.
B00ESJICMC|5.0|Great music by James Blunt. Strong song writing and production. Reminds me of his first CD and for sure I love his voice. CD is selling well and charting around the world. give it a try.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|overall game was a great choice but i wish there were more levels so i could play it for longer
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|You're going to love this game if you like city planning, building and strategy. It's not too difficult to master the basics; meeting all the goals in the allotted time is another story. I find this yo be a very relaxing game, with just enough of a challenge to keep it from being boring. I definitely recommend this game.
B00G4ZACLC|4.0|I enjoy playing the game.  I do wish, however, that there was a running scoreboard so I could compare my scores from game to game.
B0027BVMSY|3.0|not nearly as good as casino royal and honestly can be disregarded all together if you think you need to see it before watching skyfall. the plot is kinda flimsy and the whole movie feels like chase scene after chase scene.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has awesome games on it!!!!!! and if your a parent it ocupyes your kids like ive had my head stuck in it all day. for 5 hours!!!!
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|its a well made movie with good effects but the pacing is very poor and the overall story feels rushed even for the 2.5ish hour length. perhaps a two part movie with a good deal of the cut character development would have been better.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|FANTASTIC ALBUM!!! MUST GET THIS ONE!!! how many albums can you say you love almost all of the songs on?? not many, but this is one of them. Cher is the greatest.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Right on, I love to fly,fly,fly on right to the world. Girardsharon is a good flyer .I flu . All my life. Now,what<br /><br />........
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I like this one too because all the books after The Secret, The Magic are connected, but HERO doesn't has too much connection...
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I love the game but a lot of Internet connections haven't been working, and now the game is glitching!!! You need great Internet connections an order to play this game, and like it.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|Really folks? You really think this book is that good. I chose this book off of the other reviews. I really have to wonder if you all read the book. I get slammed for many of my reviews because they are hyper critical but at least when you read one of my reviews and its a good one, its a good one. There was one guy on here who said that this book bounced around a lot and was confusing while reading it but then it all came together at the end.<br /><br />I was waiting for a stirring conclusion and it was like a cement block dropped in a forest with just a thud.<br /><br />Sometimes these writers are living on their past works. In this guy's case the Kite Runner (admittedly I have not read his other book) or JK Rowling's Cuckoos Calling which was downright awful. But you can't tell me this book is even worth one star.<br /><br />It is a series of stories, the chapters last forever and I could not wait for it to end. Bottom line, the reviews on Amazon need to be more thoughtfully critical and not just oh its Khalaed Hosseini let me give this book 5 stars. I really wonder if people are reading these books all the way through.<br /><br />This book stunk!
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing... met and exceeded all expectations. It's refreshing to be able to listen to someone who can actually rap as opposed to the nonsense on the radio nowadays.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|The search algorithm is trash compared to the PC version. I got my kindle to study helicopter manuals and a search of &#34;Back-up&#34; in refernece to back-up hydraulic pump resulted in 1 find. The full version on the same pdf found all 500. Its on every page. More an annoyance on the kindle that you have to open two other programs just to open the book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Fabulous story with characters so three-dimensional they leap off the pages. The words are so beautiful I don't understand how it's possible. I bought the audiobook and hearing it was even better.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Great game. A most have if you are a fan of the series. this has six great games bundled together!
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I read a few chapters in this book, and immediately bought it for all our Partners. Required reading for any business just starting out. The authors ruthlessly cut through the BS that drives poor planning and execution for a small company with big ambition.<br /><br />Read it now.  Took me about three hours. Tops. Best investment I've made so far in infrastructure.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This version holds my interest longer than the first version. I struggled with navigation in the marketplace but once I got through it playing become easier. Great game.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well written. The story was gripping and touching . Well done. I enjoyed his other books also. They were different in style than I have read before
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Well since youtube videos were not playing I downloaded this. But every time I try to watch a video it closes. So do not buy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very happy to have kindle version so I can spread my addiction amongst my devices. sometimes slow probably due to my connection or my overburdened kindle.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Games ok Kills time and something to do it is fairly amusing and fun don't play th so it is stupid to duplicate off th but it is fun like I said
B0040I09RM|5.0|This is great for Walter Mitty types like me!  :)  I get to live vicariously a life that I have no clue about!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game! Im a horse lover nd this game makes me feel like its an acual horse!
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Longer is not necessarily better. This film is as much New Zeeland travelogue as hobbit tale. While I'm enjoying these films, I think Bilbo's story could have easily been 2 movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a amazing I play it all the the time but when my kindle froze I deleted it then a 're installed.  It but it doesn't work so I deleted all my apps and now I can't get I back minecraft pocket edition is better on other devices
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Superman does not--through inaction--allow someone to die. (Especially not his father?)<br />Superman does not kill.<br /><br />I saw tis in the theater, and will not be buying the DVD.  I already own a really good Superman movie on DVD.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is very fun for all ages to play. It works well to pass time. Also like all the graphics.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|Tasty mystery with lots of twists. Gave four rather than five because I felt other readers might think mystery equals drama and high suspense. This had those elements, but lacked brutality, profanity and crudeness, which I find profoundly refreshing and enjoyable! In fact have since read entire series and upset there is no number eight yet? Am currently beginning other series by Leighann Dobbs. Oh, forgot to mention inclusion of recipes at end of each book! Especially tasty after reading lucious explanations of pastry delights. Yum!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love this game so far, it's deep, great backstory and history, good gameplay and mechanics, and good artwork, the only downfall I see so far is I spent 5 dollars on the premium content and have no clue what It bought me, I thought it was going to be cards and decks but as far as I can see I haven't received anything but what I've won in the campaign oh well good game though
B004X6PRO6|1.0|This book depicts a lot of torture and despair. It was, to say the least, not a pleasant read. Very grueling to read.
B007V65R54|4.0|This book ranges from baseball to poker to the stock market to natural disasters to potential terrorist attacks.  A good introduction to subjective probability and forecasting for the non-specialist. The treatment of power laws is especially well done. The chapter on internet poker is boring and could have been left out without any loss to the rest of the book.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|one of my favorite movies...action packed, never a dull moment, angelina at her best. great guy movie and gals movie,,
B00EKXDVOK|3.0|I was very disappointed when this album turned out to be repackaged and perhaps remixed material that Barbra released decades ago.  For some reason, I thought this was new material but not the case.  Buyer beware.  That said, these are classics so enjoy.
B001BANK32|5.0|reread this book in anticipation of dr. sleep...highly recommend doing so...rediscover the smooth subtle quiet horror of a man being swept up in his own madness taken over by forces he cannot control...better than you remember i promise,,,
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally addictive. So glad they finally got a kindle version. Even though I play on my phone, it's still been fun to start all over on my Kindle. The candies look awesome in HD.
1451666179|5.0|i follow Allie's blog so this was a given to buy the book...all the fun stories from her blog and more awesome revelations in a bright big book. for amazing life insights and hilarity on top,,i recommend this book highly.
055338466X|4.0|This is a very broad brush, shallow, survey of modern physics. It's an interesting history of science with little substance. It covers history of science from Thales to Feynman and theory from atoms to cosmos. I doubt whether Hawking did much more than propose a topic or two before endorsing it to lend his name to the effort. It ranges from overly simple to ultra complex.<br />The idea that all elements are derived from hydrogen atoms seems to substantiate the alchemists. It's not a useful concept. The idea that “Philosophy is dead” is presented without much justification. I take it to mean that there is little that matters. The writers must mean other philosophy besides their own.<br /><br />There is everything from basic science to speculation on the source of molecular life. There are no conclusions. It's an interesting introduction to complexities of super symmetry, string theory, GUTs and M-theory, but for understanding, much more is needed. References to “Einstein's equations are not by themselves useful. Feynman's all path history concept is vaguely defined, as are QED and QCD, but the intro to diagrams with examples is informative. Modeling of life is interesting, albeit still simplistic and not likely to lead to anything useful.<br /><br />'Grand Design' is a curious strangely ambiguous title. The philosophical argument is obtuse. I get the impression that the door is as much open for intelligent design as for the possibility of spontaneous creation without a guiding hand. We need much more than presented here to attain any understanding of these complex ideas. It's an interesting read although we readers should beware of the deceptively easy reading style. “A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.” Herein is very little.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read this book about 25-30 years ago and could not put it down. I have frequently given a copy to teenagers I meet from time to time to fire up a love to read. It worked every time! I decided to reread it after learning that a nephew to whom I gave this book, when he was a teen, was introducing it to his son. To read it again was like reading it for the first time -- time changes one's perspective. When I read it the first time, it was a great read. To read it again was reading a timeless classic. This is one of the great books!
B004GNFSO0|4.0|It is very well written. It is also a very upsetting prtrayal of truth. It was too moving for me.
B000HF702E|2.0|The movie is rated PG for mild violence but I had no idea it would have bad guys with guns actually shooting at people.  If I had known this, I would NOT have rented it for my children.  If you don't like gun violence in the movies your children watch, do not watch this movie.
B0043VDIAG|2.0|It's surprising how badly written this novel is, since there are probably millions of women who read Nicholas Sparks's books (and yes, I bet no man will want to read these). The story was good and interesting and it gave some important insight to an abusive relationship. However it was quite boring, poorly written and the characters remained quite shallow. I wouldn't recommend this, better see the movie.<br />It makes me irritated that there are so few well written romantic or &#34;feel-good&#34; novels. If selling millions of books writing this poorly, I wonder why there aren't more Nicholas Sparks's?
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is ok because you don't get a lot of crowns and it takes a long time to do certain thing.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|beautiful intricate contrapuntal timings and notes. Love it. &#34;Angels We Have Heard on High&#34; is fabulously intricate. &#34;Oh Come Oh Come Emmanuel&#34; is haunting. Great album. I'll listen to it again and again.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I have been waiting for a kindle fire youtube app and the reviews on this one weren't that bad but when I went to install it it wouldn't install. Please fix this so that I can watch youtube.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Not bad at all. Fun game to play and easy to move up levels. Wish you could upgrade weapons easier but truly fun game
B005FDWM6M|4.0|Great read!  Wonderful read for nights after hitting all the parks in Orlando!  Not a big fan of ebooks so nice to have something to hold that doesn't glow
B00GINENG0|4.0|I had this app for two days. I went back on a day after, and I had to start ALL OVER!!! I was on level 10, not too high but I have to get there again. You can get this app, just make sure you don't have to start ALL OVER!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|One of the best series ive ever read! I was shocked to see so many negative reviews. Out of the three books this was my favorite! I loved the twists and turns and yes, the ending wasn't expected...but I think thats one of the things that made it great and not like every other book out there where everyone lives happily ever after! It was real and had a ton of great life lessons! LOVED IT!
0205606288|5.0|An excellent edition to keep on hand in the classroom for those students who cannot afford to purchase or rent their own copy.  Very well done.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|Hardly an dialogue - boring.  I could not care about the characters, which then makes impossible to like the movie.  Don't waste your time.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I picked this book after seeing the short-lived series KING AND MAXWELL.  This was a great book and I am looking forward to reading their further adventures.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game very addictive and finally on kindle. It's nice to be able to download it from Amazon and easily have it updated.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is just as good as Rosetta stone maybe better but they each take different approach. Both work but this is a little better.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Assuming you UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS AND WHAT IT DOES , this is the best thing since sliced bread . 99% of the complaints here are people who didn't do their homework and now are upset this doesn't do what they want .<br /><br />It's best if you have apps( I've only tested with my Nexus 4 ) that are compatible with Chromecast . Basically your device( phone , tablet , computer ect ) acts as a remote to tell the Chromecast what to play . I don't actually see the point in buying this unless you're using it with Chromecast compatible  apps . It's a cheaper alternative to the Roku or another streaming box . This is what the Chromecast is good at right now . If you try to use it for something else your results will vary .<br /><br />Google is coming out with the official Chromecast SDK in a few weeks , and then since I tinker with Java I might experiment with development , but for the price I'm already content .
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Fun. Good popcorn flick. Great special effects. Less campy than starship troopers but still doesn't take itself too seriously. Predictable? A little. But worth it.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|The game was very enjoyable as I was up to level 45.  However, the game glitched and I was reset to the beginning.  I contacted customer support for a solution and as was told that there was not one but a compensation was offered.  Two and a half weeks later with numerous e-mails between us I have received nothing.<br />  Needless to say I am almost at my previous level (35 currently).  The good news is that I learned from my initial mistakes.  I will not purchase the un-sellable concert hall nor that black cat.  By the way,  in the process of fixing my issue I was instructed to I stall ice age village.  Alas, to no avail.<br /><br />Summary:  kind of fun but buggy.  Poor customer service that promises but cannot deliver.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I must admit, . I expected this to be a try it once. and quit game, but I'm thrilled to say it's definitely worth the $1. There's nothing like killing everyone to release your frustrations, are all. And the abilities actually make sense. The game is well balanced, and just realistic enough to be a bit creepy. Definitely a keeper :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun, I love minions so this is my dream game. I would suggest this game to anyone.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|i do not understand how people give this movie one star? This is one of the funniest movies made in the last ten years, seriously. iits low brow and well i guess it is a stupid plot but i always laugh at it. I am a child of the 80's and watched it with a younger friend who thought it was &#34;lame&#34; i guess if your around 34-40 check itout
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This is the best Grisham I've read! Had trouble putting it down. Well paced, good character development, overall very enjoyable read.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Just plain addictive. I can't stop playing this game! I like the variety of animals to hunt. Fun and challenging.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just wanted to know his side of it I would read all three books all over just to see his point of view
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|This movie is as much a brain challenge to keep track of the 5 characters through their lives we see portrayed by &#34;A&#34; class actors as it is entertainment.  Don't let other 2-3 star ratings scare you, they just didn't get it and wanted something more simple.  But that commentary is not about the movie's high quality as it is about them. Take the dive, it will carry your mind off whatever you had going on, and the end of movie credits of just how many other characters each actor played will surprise you, no doubt.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|My sister loves Andrea Bocelli.  He keeps her company while she cleans. I generally buy things like this as what we call an &#34;I love you&#34; gift.  She never knows what to expect.
B006BQNJR8|3.0|Movie was ok. Just a remake of the previous Conan movie. If you liked the first you'll like this one too.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a really great movie!! I would definitely recommend this one. It came to us very quickly, sooner than expected.
0765356139|5.0|I really like all the Mistborn books so far.  Great plot and character development, as well as a very entertaining read.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This is a really great movie!! I would definitely recommend this one. It came to us very quickly, sooner than expected.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Scientist's record of his NDE while in a coma, and his journey from an agnostic to a believer.  Worth reading.
6305428425|5.0|This is a really great movie!! I would definitely recommend this one. It came to us very quickly, sooner than expected.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This has to be one of the most fun games ever! This game is extremely realistic and requires a lot of strategy.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is a really great movie!! I would definitely recommend this one. It came to us very quickly, sooner than expected.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After I saw catching fire in theaters and it ended like that I had to find out what happened to Peeta. I got mockingjay and couldn't put it down. I kept wanting Katniss to fall for Peeta again and she did even after all of their craziness. I was happy to see that there was an epilogue and that Peeta and Katniss ended up I guess you could say happily ever after. I read this book in only 2 days because I couldn't put it down...I can't wait until the movie comes out and I'll be sure to see it opening day!!
B0000YEEGM|5.0|This is a really great movie!! I would definitely recommend this one. It came to us very quickly, sooner than expected.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Event though there are 16 cards, there is so much game here! I can't believe it. The production quality is awesome and I love the packaging. I will carry this game where ever I go because it's so portable and a great gateway game for those who aren't into big euro or other big board games. This is well worth the money I spent! Love this!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this one it is much better than the dungeon hunter 3 graphics are great . I also heat really in to the story line all around it is a great game
B000000WG4|5.0|Tubular Bells was made famous by the movie the Exorcist. But the whole album is basically one continuous song. But it is so well done and relaxing I have gone through several tapes and one album from playing this over and over! Now to have it on a CD is wonderful!!
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|The Circle is a frightening look into a future that could be probable.  With the rise of technology, immediateness, &#34;friends&#34;, open comments and the ability to &#34;be seen and be known&#34;, Eggers novel provokes the reader to wonder the hows and whys of human desire to &#34;be heard&#34; but without actual human contact.  Eggers also shows how the rise in technology could, under the guise of open and free access, rob one of the heart of democrocy--the right to choose.<br /><br />This is a thought-provoking book and one, while perhaps not elegant in prose, will make one stop and think about how technology could re-shape our future.
1574535811|5.0|Do you want scientific information why a plant based diet is better than an animal based diet for human beings. Well this book is the answer for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101games is really fun cause you have a bunch of games to play and its intertaning and I play it all the time!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This game is really fun. You have to start with only earth, wind, water and fire and make all kinds of things: man, woman, beast, Yoshi (from Mario Bros). Totally fun and engaging!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|One of the best family movies ever . . . strong messages about love, family (family by birth and those we construct ourselves), and conservation. Beautiful colors, movement, and music! Highly recommended for all ages.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I really enjoyed the first 2 books, but this one made me feel like I was going around in a circle. Not sure if that was to make people feel like the characters learning so much new information or what, but I was tired of reading after the first 5 chapters.<br /><br />The ending did not make me smile either. I don't want to spoil it so I won't say any more.<br /><br />I thought it would be better, but it was a pretty good read.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's not too often that the 1st chapter of any book grabs me but this one surprisingly did. I was pleasantly surprised that it did have a good story despite the fact that everyone I asked (who has read it) seems to emphasized only on the sex scenes. The author captured the emotions quite well & found myself on edge with suspense and crying at times. The intimate scenes were described in pages of details but it got old (to me) by the second book & skipped those pages and just wanted to get to the actual story. I enjoyed the trilogy & it was one of those I can't put down until I finish type of book.

B00FB6FOEU|5.0|Old school Joan Jett.  JJ was a staple on my turntable during the early 1980's (still remember driving to Florida for college spring break with only an 8 track of &#34;I Love Rock n Roll&#34; in the car).  I've bought every release since and consider myself a big fan...but I like some stuff a lot more than others.  I put this one in the 5 Star category and love it.  All of the tunes are awesome but my favorite is TMI.  Enjoy Joan Jett doing what she does best....rocking it.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was definitely a page turner.  It's very similar to Pelican Brief (my favorite Grisham book), so I only gave 4 stars for similar plot structure.  There are so many complicated twists and turns that it keeps the readers attention.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|This review contains major spoilers. Please don't continue if you haven't finished the series.<br /><br />Before I read Allegiant, I saw the negative outpouring here and figured readers were upset because the romance did not resolve how they wanted. I was completely wrong.<br /><br />People are upset because they feel cheated--and very rightfully so. When you write a book series in the first person voice, you are entering into a default agreement with your readers. Veronica Roth broke this agreement, plain and simple. The first-person narrator always survives the story. To have any other result is ridiculously illogical and a cheap trick to boot. This is very basic, beginning creative writing stuff. If a student writer tried to pull something like this in a creative writing course, they'd be laughed out of the room.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Roth maintains that she planned the end all along. Okay, then why on earth wasn't the whole series in third-person voice, or at least in dual perspective as we had in Book Three with Tris and Four speaking? It's clear that Roth had certain philosophical goals here, but she could have met these goals easily without resorting to such a ridiculous solution.<br /><br />At the end of the day, some \\"rules\\" for writing exist because to break them means disaster, and that's pretty much what we have here. The story itself had other issues, but none are as significant as the point of view problem. It's a sad end for what had promised to be a stellar series.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Don't think I didn't like the book. I liked it a lot. I was very glad Doc didn't die by Rose, or anything else. The story did make me think that life is a wheel and spikes do get thrown in our path. How we get trough them tells a lot about ourselves.<br />I truly loved the story. Intense.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|Enjoyable read. There were some funny parts, however I didn't find it as laugh out loud funny as some other reviewers did apparently. It was cute and kept me interested and as I said, there were some funny moments. I would recommend this book. Once I've really some other books and forgotten some of the details of this book I'd say ill probably read it again.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|The good things are that there is adventure puzzling things.It is just like 2-D minecraft you can make 3 characters 3 world's and there is so many monsters to find and kill and it is multiplayer!!!!!<br />There are so things that are bad things a little blood sometimes when you kill there is one thing that says hell sadly and sometimes you lose contention in multiplayer but that's it and there is so much more that I haven't seen yet!

B000I0QK74|5.0|I love James Taylor and this album is simply a classic.  We listen to it all season and view it as a must-have for Christmas!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great, it was sad but it was something you couldn't put down. It kept you on the edge of your seat . I read it in 5 days. I was so caught up in it, I stayed up till 1:00am. I loved how detailed it was, and how it explained everything that Katniss was feeling.
B00GTZJLAK|5.0|Though in many ways this had a similar story line to the first Cars movie (rookie desires to win the big race), it still feels fresh.  Dusty Crophopper desires to be more than what his original purpose was.  He wishes to enter an around-the-world race that usually is reserved for planes that are built for racing.  When he manages to make the cut, he has to deal with the prejudices of being a &#34;farm boy.&#34;  Aside from the challenges he faces from the difficult race and his fear of heights (imagine a plane afraid of heights), he also has to put up with the dirty trickery from other racers who don't play fair.  However, he has old and new friends helping him out:  the grounded Skipper (a war hero who suffers post traumatic stress), Dusty's best friend Chug (forgetful and big-mouthed), the nerdy girl whose name I've forgotten but is just as endearing, and the Spanish plane whose name I've also forgotten.  The characters are memorable...the names aren't.<br /><br />In many ways, I like this story better than Cars.  It is more exciting and adventurous, since it shows the various obstacles Dusty has to face traveling around the world.  Dusty is a much more likable character than Lightening McQueen was.  The film actually promotes many good morals:  doing it anyway despite what anyone tells you and no matter how great the odds, always be a good guy (it does pay in the end), among others.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I'm having trouble with it.  Can not get into next level even though I've completed the previous level.<br />Have tried different things to no avail.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|At times I couldn't put this book down and at other times I felt the story was too drawn out.<br />A pilgrimage that went on too long, but in saying that...there was humour, heartache and a lot of blisters. A sentimental story following life's journey and putting love back into a marriage. Harold discovers when talking to people along the way, there are many people like him, struggling to put one foot in front of the other.
140006922X|5.0|I was quite surprised as I was reading it that it was as short as it was.  My Kindle only went to 60% when I suddenly found myself going over all of his research--kudos to Reza for doing his homework.  I really was impressed with this guy’s approach to a very controversial figure.  My own influence, education, indoctrination (my opinion) and knowledge is based upon a very loose knit “buffet” of catechism a smattering of Jesus Movement in highschool days and simple curiosity.  At this point in my life it seems to have been simple curiosity all along (attached to a greater interest in church architecture), but that is not what I want to talk about.  What I can say about Azlan’s book is that he has made in 216 pages a more cohesive and coherent story about the man Jesus than I ever got from any sermon, bible read or argument/discussion with anyone knowledgeable about this figure.  I can recall that my reads through the New Testament never made sense.  The Catholics were notorious for not wanting you to know the history, it was the message of faith in your god that made the import not trivial details like facts.  ANNNNNNNDDDDDDD let me tell you the real eye opener of this book to me was the story of Saul/Paul.  I knew of him and I also  knew his story and his revelation and his zeal for spreading the message of the Christ(not Jesus)--(great drama for impressionable young Catholic children).  But I never knew he was credited as the “writer” in the NT.  For some reason I thought it was the apostle Paul, who really doesn’t figure in any of the writings in the NT! (yes I am quite aware that those credited with certain books of the bible are not necessarily the writers another trivial fact that seems downplayed by the Christians today).  Boy I could have had a V8!  It certainly clears the air of so many inconsistencies that I have /had about the Acts and Letters.  The historical background of the charged environment of the day and the oppression's of the peoples, especiallythe poor, makes sense on the zeal that sent them looking for a new leader whether it be messiah or revolutionary leader-some things don't change I see this same phenomenon currently.  There is always a group seeking to find someone to dig them out of their hole.<br /><br />Azlan’s theory of a dual Christian movement makes more sense to me on how it applies to the history of those times and concurrently illustrates how this new movement evolved (it actually was more like a big bang theory—I say this because if Rome hadn’t razed the Temple  and  decimated the Jews it would be a wonder if the Vatican would be Saint James and not Saint Peters ).This insiduous evolution to adapt itself to the changing times and appeal to the pagan and gentile masses  (according to Azlan that was not the historical Jesus’ intention)  without it becoming a victim of Romes disfavor and thus risk extinction was a very good move by the leaders of that faith—boy this situation would do Darwin proud.  The picture of Paul’s zealotry carries still to this day; I can see that type of fervor in the Evangelicals and Fundamentalists –and they are as loopy as he seemed to be.  One more thing I have to mention which the book makes very clear in it’s presentation;  I have always known that historically the Catholic Church has practiced assimilation of beliefs into its own and simply makes things up as it goes along in order to get the followers (we know force is very effective as well and they certainly  didn’t hold back on that one).  It’s interesting to note that it was from the very beginning they had taken an idea and molded it to fit the times and people—I guess that continued up to the time of the  Council of Nicea and then they they put a stop to it.  Once that happened anything that went against the rules either you died as a saint or were burned as a sinner.  Gee and I thought that actually was a practice that came much later with the Conquistatores.<br /><br />Good read.  Its thought provoking.  I know it wont make Christians happy, but he does a good job at trying to meld history and legend/myth together in a more coherent way.  I couldn't discuss this book with my more fervently faithful friends, but I suspect they wouldn't read it anyway.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Got battery pro free, have been using it for several months. Seems fairly<br />Accurate, on occasion IT stops working and has to be rebooted. Thus I would give it a four star rating.
1416972242|5.0|Great fantasy story! I fell in love with the characters immediately and could not put the book down. I read all five books in the series in a matter of three weeks. I love the way Ms Clare brings it all together at the end.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|it's a good game to play. And seriously who doesn't love to play it on any device. Spectacular and fun to play.
B002CM03PQ|3.0|I bought this product for the additional performances not included in the regular director's cut.  It was good to see the performances of CCR and a few others not previously seen.  It made me appreciate the camera work and editing done on the actual movie performances, because the bonus footage was just standard footage and not nearly as interesting from a visual perspective.  I wanted to see the footage of the Grateful Dead and then understood why I hadn't seen it before.  It was a lackluster performance and the lighting was terrible, because the festival producers were not catering to the needs of the film crew.  Based on the extra footage provided I thought the set was way overpriced.  They tried to justify the high cost by including a lot of unnecessary packaging and nicknacks that didn't add much real value.  They even included a little Woodstock tambourine, which is not something I would have paid for.  I would say just buy the director's cut.  Most of the additional performances are available on Youtube.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is an engrossing read from beginning to end. Not only is it a great story, the writing is exceptional. If you enjoy reading books about characters - something a lot deeper than your typical NY Times best sellers then you'll enjoy this book. It's long but I had trouble putting it down and was sad when I got to the end. I'd actually compare it quite favorably to Catcher in the Rye but with a greater richness. It will become a classic and should.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft it is the best game ever.  when I turned on my kindle the app was deleted.  I thought that was really weird.

B000MD9UJC|3.0|Doesn't 100% fit the lite, but usable, I was disappointed.  Would not buy it again, it makes the light not very adjustable.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Great action and tickles the brain to think it is probably true. It is not a mystical clue-driven plot but is equally good for someone like me (who also likes Clancy type books with lots of real but little known facts).
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love buying on eBay.  Being able to use my Kindle when I am away is great.<br />It is convenient when I am away from home just need to be in a WiFi area.
0804165734|5.0|I really enjoy the unabridged version. It's a well done take on a huge idea in current pop culture. This version includes important pieces that were missing from the original.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Amazing best ever. I highly recommend this griping series<br />You should bye this before any other series James cashmere has put done his self
B003UD7JEE|2.0|Unfortunately I had already viewed the movie starring Bridgett Fonda in the role of Nikita based on the original French film plus had purchased and viewed all of the seasons of LaFemme Nikita starring Peta Wilson in the role of Nikita prior to purchasing  this version.  IMO there is no comparison between this version and either of the other versions of Nikita which I have already mentioned.  It just doesn't ring true and the relationships among the characters don't seem genuine; as a viewer I am not drawn in with this version of Nikita and have rarely found the action scenes that exciting.  To the credit of the writers and producers they did change the story line totally in an attempt to keep people from continuously comparing this version to LaFemme Nikita.  I do not recommend this version of Nikita; a much better choice for casting, writing, directing and acting for action/thriller fans is LaFemme Nikita available through amazon.com.
B00FXMECS6|4.0|This movie was entertaining enough but the audio of the HD Rental Version was awful.  We could not hear any dialogue no matter how high we turned up the volume and then of course we had to keep turning it down during the action sequences.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This is the best free book you'll read all year.  Maybe even better than that.  Ms. Swank has a fabulous eye for the details of southern life, she writes terrific dialog and her storytelling is second to none.  Her characters are real, easy to relate to, flawed, and ever so human.  There's humor and pathos and suspense and mystery and wisdom here.<br /><br />Rose Gardner is a joy.  She grows and changes, becoming more of the person she was meant to be and she struggles with that.  She finds love in the midst of loss, pain, and fear, and she never backs down from a challenge or a mystery.<br /><br />I love these characters, and I love this book.  If you like a good mystery, a good story, a world of interesting, realistic characters, and a few hours of an enjoyable book then read this one.  I cannot say enough good things about this book, about this series, and about this author's other books.  Denise Grover Swank is the real deal when it comes to writing and storytelling and you owe it to yourself to read her stuff.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|disappointing. shoot em up movie and not the typical good plotting and characterization that went into the shows. the element of the human condition is completely missing.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Clear, responsive.  Many of these games are somewhat blurry and &#34;jittery&#34; on the screen presentation.  Bubble Witch is clear, well presented on the Kindle and fun to play as if on a much larger monitor.
030759565X|4.0|I absolutely love the recipes from this cookbook and from Deb's blog. My one complaint is that the recipes are not laid out super clearly. The ingredients are on one page and you usually have to flip back and forth between the ingredients and the directions.

B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|A very cute show with a lot of very funny moments.The actors were well chosen for their parts also.A lot of adult situations and language,but used in a lighthearted, meant to be funny way.The language was not necessary and added nothing to the show,but seems to come with most movies now. I'd suggest  you watch it with people you know well and are comfortable with.

B005CAATXG|5.0|One of those groups that if you told me about them &#34;Their a Christian band, with a positive message&#34; I never would have given them a shot, instead stumbled across them one night during you-tube surfing and they easily stepped into my top listened to bands.  They aren't blatantly proving their religion, but rather take the core values and try to instill those into their songs.<br /><br />Top Track:<br />Theatre - such an awesome way to open an album<br /><br />but in all honestly every track rocks and cycles to the 'top' for me depending on my mood.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|I tore through the first two books in this series but this one wasn't doing it for me. It was slow paced at times and I kept having to go back to the front of each chapter to see if it was the Tris or Tobias chapter. There should have been two clear voices developed for Tris and Tobias but they sound exactly the same. I read the spoilers so the ending didn't shock me. Minor spoiler ahead: On some level I understood why the author ended it the way she did....the first book starts out with Tris thinking she's not selfless so in the end of the last one, what's the most selfless thing to do?? I was just ready for the book to end honestly.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Spoilers!<br /><br />What kind of book lets all the bad characters live (without a fight or climax I might add) and all the good ones die?  I get that sometimes good characters die and sometimes it's required that they do, but ALL of them?!  There is no resolution in this book, just misery, depression, and pointlessness.<br /><br />This book DRAGGED on, felt meandering, and had hardly any point at all.  There were all these extra plot lines that got introduced in the last book that were SO out of place.  I was willing to consider the genetic story line but what the heck was with the fringe people?!  They go into this story almost like for a change of scenery. They don't fix anything, help people, and it made no difference to the City of Chicago.<br /><br />I can't believe this got published.  I would have rather waited another year for her to come up with a better story.  It's almost like the author had three weeks write this.  I'm super disappointed, to the point that I won't be buying this for Xmas gifts like I had wanted to.  I'm actually hoping Hollywood fixes this mess because it was THAT BAD that they can't make it worse.
B00E1LR2B4|5.0|Was so glad our town finally brougt 20 Feet From Stardom here, and I was lucky enough to see it in the theatre. It is a great tale of several background singers. Their lives in and out of show business. Darlene Love was truly wonderful. And also enjoyed T'ata Vega, and Merry Clayton. They all really were terrific in the film. It was fun to see Darlene Love along with her group The Blossoms,  have a reunion after 40 years. I particularly enjoyed hearing them do backing on That's Life the Frank Sinatra hit. If you are a music lover, a follower of the girl group sound, or just someone who appreciates a good movie, see 20 Feet From Stardom.
031623480X|5.0|The book is awesome. I am so impressed with his ability to educate the masses about the dangers of refined carbs, sugars and<br />how it brings on depression, ADHD, Alzheimers, Dementia, Anger, Violent behavior, Diabetes, Constipation, etc etc.  Everyone should read this book today. Even if you are a strict vegetarian. On his website he goes into vegetarian meals. But the heart of the matter is that sugar and refined flour is killing us all and shrinking our brains!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is not a get to the point and get it done book.  Stephen King has changed a lot since I read nothing but his books as a kid.  I'd taken a hiatus since finishing the Dark Tower and i was mistaken, he has only gotten better.  Great book with lots of thought-provoking moments.  Read it, you'll enjoy it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Nice visuals and runs smoothly. Its a match three game with a little extra, a great way to pass the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I like the seeds nyan is  the best seed ever in nyan there is lava falls water falls giant cliff. And I love the building once I built a giant 7 story house.I would recommend that you get this game and try the seed nyan. GET THIS GAME NOW!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I like it when a book grabs my attention so thoroughly from the beginning. This one had me from that first chapter and I appreciated the twists and turns because they were not expected and even shocking.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Good device for low price.  Needs more app support to be great.  Tab casting (although in beta) is a great concept that can be improved upon.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|they should inform us that it can not be used with hard disks, i figured that out after reading the manual.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Just like any other game. Not that exciting at all and you have to wait for everything when you get it.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Great game! Fun to try to meet all the achievements. Just wish it would let me change the background to a pic on my phone. Won't work but at least can change color. Would like to have more card choices.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|My 8 year old grandson bought this with his saved up money for his dad for Hanukkah.  The dad was thrilled, he has always wanted a real DeLorean, but  is just as happy with this gift from the heart.  It has many more details than we first thought.  I highly recommend for any fans of the movies
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The graphics are amazing and it makes you feel young again, takes you back to being a child again, exciting and heart warming.  Love it !!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This novel was definitely a page turner. I could not put it down. It was touching, sweet, sad, and closely described what conflicting emotions can lead one to do.  I'm not sure I was satisfied with the ending but it was still a very good read.
B004DBU0UW|5.0|I just love this movie.  I've owned it on Beta, VHS, LaserDisc, DVD. BluRay, etc.  I'm sure I've watched it a hundred times.  It's a powerful story of a heroic, flawed, and tragic figure, and the movie somehow transports us into his life, and we join him in his journey.  Admittedly, however, my wife refuses to let me play it one more time in her presence; so pick your movie partner with care.
0385743564|5.0|Sanderson is a spectacular writer who manages to create a world of individuals with unique powers, but does so in a whole new way. The Epic's behaviors are an interesting take on how truly gifted people would act. I couldn't put the story down and this is one of the best novels I have read in a long time! Outstanding!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|A great collection of hits from one of the greatest bands of the 70s and 80s.  I regret that I never saw them live in their prime; it always seemed that there would be another opportunity, and this album makes your mind wander to earlier times,
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This crazy thing is Addicting and my kids love to play it too so they are always trying to steal my Kindle :)
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Season 2 is perhaps not quite the same fun as the first season, particularly as the storyline becomes somewhat darker, but once you're hooked you can't miss what comes next.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Interesting game, keeps you on your toes and thinking. Love it and would recommend to those who love being challenged.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|They have a lot if cool characters and when you upgrade they have a new level so download it and this will be you number one game so download.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Great CD, great rapper all songs are great and you will enjoy them all don't think it twice to get it
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|I didn't download it, my grandson did.  He seems to like it. It kept him busy for quite a while.
B0006JGFNQ|2.0|Does not dance as described only makes one noise. Replaced batteries thinkinking this wout help, but still doesn't do what it was described to do, Grandson disappointed and I am too.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I like that Jake is the main character.  I can still picture the characters from &#34;A Time To Kill&#34;.  Anything that John Grisham writes is going to be a great book.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|.Children love it as well as adults. Fun while needing to pass the time. Will not be disappointed with this one
B000005J56|5.0|Wonderful album!  Listen a couple times and you'll be hooked! If you buy this album, do yourself a favor and download the songs to FLAC or WAV lossless.  The sound quality will make you feel like your are in Old Havana.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a pretty fun game and the graphics are awesome for sure! It was a bit confusing at the beginning but figured it out.
B00G5G7EXY|2.0|Took my wife and kids to see this during the Thanksgiving holiday and felt the movie was mediocre at best.<br /><br />The story about a king/queen who have 2 young daughters.  The older daughter (Elsa) is has the ability to create ice/snow through anything she touches with her hands/feet.  Why Elsa has this ability is never explained.  Elsa accidentally hurts her younger sister while playing one day and is segregated from her younger sister so she won't hurt her again.<br /><br />In the meantime the parents die unexpectedly while taking a voyage.<br /><br />The two sisters then re-unite and invite the townspeople and others living abroad to Elsa's coronation to take over as queen.<br /><br />Something predictable happens and the rest of the movie is spent with the sisters battling, then re-uniting for the happy ending.<br /><br />Personally, I found the movie to be completely lacking in story-telling and character development.  There were no real villains, just a few individuals with greedy aspirations that were somewhat hard to believe (Hans).<br /><br />The supporting characters (snowman, trolls) did not add much to the film and the movie dragged on to a predictable but disappointing ending.<br /><br />My wife and kids enjoyed the movie and it is okay but if you compare it to films like Tangled or Brave my feeling is that you will come away feeling like it should have been much better.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I have officially became a recent fan of The Big Bang Theory series and so far I have absolutly nothing negative to say about this show. I was amazed to see how hilarious and awesome this show is. The series is made by a few people who made Two and a Half Men so if you like that show you will not be disappointed by The Big Bang Theory. The show has really good actors (ex: Jim Parsons) which makes the show amazing. At the time I make this review the series is currently on their 7th season and the first 6 Seasons are available to watch live on TV, you can buy the show on DVD and Blu-ray HD, or download it on iTunes and Amazon Instant Video. If you like Sitcoms/Comedy Shows like Two and a Half Men, Everybody Loves Raymond, Friends, Family Guy, American Dad, etc. you will definetly enjoy The Big Bang Theory!
B009G41CG2|5.0|Very challenging.  Lots of different puzzles to choose from and they vary in degree of difficulty.  I highly recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Really good novel. I really enjoy the character development. Waiting for the next Harry b. novel. Looking forward to it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a good game if you like locked room puzzles. I wish there had been more animation. That would make it more entertaining.
B00DZJ82TY|5.0|new remastering is great. extra or bonus songs for fans only. Mr. Morrison not involved in this project at all.
B00632HWOG|4.0|nice app, I'm not a big yahoo fan but I have an email account there, its very easy to use and very nice themes
B0042KA5EK|3.0|While this series is definitely entertaining, it's clearly not up to comparisons with the &#34;original&#34; La Femme Nikita TV series.  Many of the characters are just as compelling, but some of the differences throw off the balance of the show - and the overall theme of season one (Percy and the black boxes) is too over simplified in comparison to the 'original' show.<br /><br />That said, the show definitely had it's moments, and I did enjoy watching it through the first season.  &#34;Ask me how I got here&#34;.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Both challenging and fun.  Played both level 1 and 2.  Hope there is a third.  Pirate Adventure 3:  Kitty and Jack start dating?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is certainly right there with King 's very best.  Ride along on this journey and I guarantee you won't be able to put it down.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie, such fun to watch. I watched it with grandkids and it was fun to hear them laugh.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Fun, challenging game. Haven't gotten very far, but I love it so far. Great colors, and fun sounds. I would recommend it if you liked the other &quot;flow&quot; games.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|The events inside the airplane were great until the crash. The rest of the movie was dry and boring. Cannot believe this movie won an Academy award.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Just read Ender's Game and saw the movie, and needed more!  This was a fantastic<br /> sequel but not really a sequel since the Ender I knew was 3000+ years older and somwas civilization.  Amazingly imaginative aliens and ethical quandaries, I could not put it down.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easily one of the best media consumption devices for me - Netflix, Pandora, Google Play Music, YouTube and Hulu Plus!<br /><br />Awesome device!
B0013F1D02|5.0|The story is great, and it is very entertaining. Special effect is well done and not overdone. It's very enjoyable.
0525951652|5.0|Follett develops his characters so well, his stories are fascinating and entertaining, and his history lessons here are so, so interesting.  This is one of his many bests!
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|Despite 75 years of trying there is no one but Errol Flynn for this role.  He was/is/will always be the only true Robin Hood!<br /><br />Great story, great production, truly stellar cast.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you own a android device and an HD TV, you will not find a better value.<br /><br />This simple little dongle allows you to \\"cast\\" full 1080p video from your android device (or windows chrome browser) to your HDTV.<br /><br />I have owned one since the week they came out. It's support has gotten better and better. This is a product that has and will see strong support from the development committee. The SDK isn't even completed and it already has support from Netflix, Pandora, Google Play, YouTube, and now HBO Go to name a few. This product can only get better!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Good imagination and premise, but would've liked to have more insight into the inner thoughts of the heroine as she battled for survival. Some actions seemed out of character to me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addictive not just for kids but for adults too. So fun. I love how challenging it is for you. Really fun game.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Harry Bosch as usual- Harry against the whole LAPD.  This time I really thought they were going to fire him or press charges against  him for obstruction of justice. But  as usual Harry comes out smelling like a rose.  The book has a good rhythm to it and reads well.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Really like the game to pass the time, but I don't like that you run out of vault space and have to buy coin, etc.  Free game but not really.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is a great game that had me playing it for hours as soon as I got it. Hard to put down love the neon colors, the little explosions of sound, and cannot wait to get to more difficult levels!
1476729085|4.0|I don't know that I would characterize this book as \\"hilarious\\" but for me, certainly parts of it were so funny that I laughed out loud.<br /><br />\\"Discordant sound, wind, risk of death - I tried to assume the mental state that I used at the dentist\\" - Don Tillman to himself during an early-in-the-relationship outing with Rosie.<br /><br />There were also parts that I found aggravating (cheating best friend) and parts I found a little sad because Don knows he is not like other people - like when Rosie first gives him her phone number and he marvels at it because it's what other people experience but not him he says that he's been included (briefly) into a culture he felt was closed to him.<br /><br />I found this book a very fast read. I started it at about 3:00pm and finished it at about 11:30pm. It isn't my usual fare but I found it kept my attention and I thought Don Tillman was very engaging. I wanted to know what would happen for him next.<br /><br />There are no explicit sex scenes in this book and I can't remember there being any profanity either.<br /><br />From what I know of Asperger's, I felt the writing was mostly spot on for a high functioning individual with the syndrome although from what I've read, it can vary. In any case, it made me curious about how he came to write the character as he did. There is nothing that I can recall in the acknowledgments that mentioned anyone in the medical field giving him any help so is this just his \\"take\\" on how someone with the syndrome would relate to the world? Does he know someone with Asperger's? Probably this doesn't matter to most but I find lots of times after reading a book that I want to know more about the author and/or the subject matter and I wish in this case he would have included a bit about how he came to write about someone with Asperger's because it's not a subject you find very often in fiction.<br /><br />This is one of those books that I could have read in a chaotic place  or that I could have put down for a few days and not been lost when I found the time to pick it up again and that's not because it's simplistic but more because it's straightforward, I found the characters memorable and the author doesn't waste time going over and over anything the way some fiction books seem to. This book is cohesive and it flows.<br /><br />It's not a keeper for me (I won't be re-reading it) but it was an enjoyable way to spend a rainy Saturday..put down for a few days and not been lost when I found the time to pick it up again and that's not because it's simplistic but more because it's straightforward, I found the characters memorable and the author doesn't waste time going over and over anything the way some fiction books seem to.

B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|A wonderful book for the age of the writer. Offers the reader a greater perspective. Malala is a true hero.
B00FIUO8MI|3.0|The book was slow to get into and after reading a number of other dystopian books, the ending to this one was slightly dissapointing.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I just began playing Castleville. It is a beautiful game with great graphics and an interesting storyline. I can't wait to free the other characters.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I have a first generation Bose Sounddock that's been gathering dust for several years since I don't use my iPod Classic much anymore and listen mostly to streaming internet stations. This simple little device lets me hook up my iPod touch, iPhone, iPad and Android tablet and even my travel laptop to this fantastic speaker which now gets daily use. No flaky bluetooth to fool with which can fail without warning...and this simple solution works with ALL of my devices without any fuss or frustration. One of the best purchases I've made in the past year - so happy to be able to enjoy my fantastic sounding Sounddock again!! FIVE STARS for this clever and well constructed little gadget.

B00EW9GQR6|4.0|Well, let's start it! The album itself is great and danceable!<br />A lot of cool songs, I just do not like the song 'Aura' due the &#34;poor quality&#34; of the music where only the chorus is good.<br />This album talks a lot of sex and drugs, the song 'Dope' is so much depressive, I don't like it.<br /><br />I was waiting for an album with meaningful lyrics and life experiences that help us to overcome problems, but it was not! It is a danceable album, with fun, sex and drugs lyrics! I like it because I am a Little Monster and I love all her works!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game especially since it changes every month.cuff factor off f2f f t f f2f the f t
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Enjoyable the game but it can take a bit to finish levels. I feel like the booster prices are a bit high too.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is so fun i can play it all day. The person who made this game really need to start making more
B00BAXFECK|5.0|What can I say about this wonderful book to convince you to stop reading the reviews right this second and buy it? Whatever it is, consider it said. I have never finished reading a book and then immediately turned back to page one to begin again, except with The Goldfinch.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game even the movie. I been trying to get my family to get this game so I can see how they built their worlds
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everyone should read this.!! I love it.!! I've watched the movie, but the book is way better.!! Take a little time out of your day to read it.!! You won't regret it.!! I know I didn't.!
B00BATG18K|5.0|The main character, Violet Minturn, is a young girl raised in a courtesan house, where women are courted for sexual favors. As expected, Violet's life is fraught with drama and tragedy. She's fatherless, enjoys spying on the courtesans as they're having sex with their visitors and is a lonely child attached to her cat.<br /><br />Tan has a really good eye for descriptions and went into lengthy detail to describe every setting and person that the two main characters encounter. The first 75% of the book is written in Violet's first person point of view. Even though there is a lot of interesting historical detail, I found it strange that a young girl would observe and note so much detail about furnishings and locations.<br /><br />Lots of disasters happen to Violet, including being kidnapped from her mother and stuck in a house of prostitution, but Violet spends paragraph after paragraph describing the setting, furniture, business model and competition for the new house she finds herself imprisoned in. It was almost like she was an impartial observer to her own story and so intrigued by the political machinations of a house of ill repute that she didn't have time for emotion. I thought to myself, she got over that rather quickly.<br /><br />Although she suffers heartbreak after heartbreak, she is still naive enough to be tricked and betrayed by a slew of sleazy characters. We learn that the same thing happened to her mother years ago. She also imagined people were more trustworthy than they were.<br /><br />Violet's best friend, Magic Gourd, was the only constant in her life. She was the Tiger Mom to Violet, eager to make her the best courtesan ever. She pushed her to practice singing, taught her sexual techniques, told her stories and folk tales to please men, hired actors to help her learn her trade, sewed gowns for her, shopped for jewelry for her, checked out the suitors, and basically plotted and planned Violet's debut into the world of high end prostitution. As a typical Tiger Mother, she was disappointed when Violet was not voted Top Ten Beauty, and vowed to have her try harder the next year.<br /><br />I enjoyed the short-lived romance Violet had with Edward, an American, but as is typical in Amy Tan's books, no happiness lasts long.<br /><br />This book read like a history lesson mixed with graphic sexual descriptions with laugh out loud names for sexual organs: stem, petals, gates, sword, scabbard, and pudendum. Most of the sexual scenes bordered on disgusting, especially the violent ones. And Violet never really reacts to the pain and humiliation she endures. She's too busy describing the dents on the table, or the small pieces of lint on the rug, or the seams on the curtains.<br /><br />While I read the book eagerly, it was hard to connect to the main characters because they were too distant. They were more focused on storytelling than allowing the reader to experience through their eyes. The male characters were cardboard and generally a bunch of jerks, with Edward perhaps the only one with any redeeming qualities. Violet and Edward's romance was sweet and had some poignant moments, but passed away too quickly.<br /><br />[spoilers follow]<br /><br />The narration at 75% from Violet's mother, Lulu or Lucia, was all backstory and in my opinion not needed. We already knew what had happened to Violet and her baby brother. We know things went wrong with her relationship to Violet's father, and I felt we didn't really need to know all the details of her seducing him, and her cold relationship with her parents. Finally, I found it unbelievable that a shrewd madam like Lulu would so EASILY be tricked by Fairweather [in the turning point of the story] because darnit! This is not the first child who was stolen by a man she trusted! Didn't she have inklings of deja vu? Or thought to herself, I don't hand over a child to a man who says we'll meet on board the ship because years ago, I handed a baby to a man who said he'd take him to visit his family and never returned. And get this, the reason she's on the ship is so she can go to San Francisco to see this son who was kidnapped. But never once does she suspect her daughter would be stolen. This trickery could be seen by the reader a mile away, but because it is a necessary plot point, Lulu had to be temporarily blinded to the sneaky man who no one trusted, especially her side kick who warned her about it. [Incidentally, years later, Violet also persists on being easily duped despite Magic Gourd's repeated predictions of disaster. Like mother, like daughter?]<br /><br />Plot threads were also dropped and never revived. The entire plot hinges on Violet's abduction because her mother wanted to go to San Francisco to see the son who was kidnapped, but after Lulu returns home, she decided she didn't feel like seeing this son anymore because she grieves for her daughter who the scoundrels told her was killed while crossing a street.<br /><br />Lulu, we must remember, is a sophisticated madam in Shanghai where lies flow like wine. After arriving in San Francisco, she receives a telegram from her best friend/sidekick saying her daughter has died and she believes it and stays in San Francisco without even once going back to Shanghai to investigate. Lulu has ALL these contacts with men who frequent the courtesans in Shanghai. If she were to return, she would no doubt have ferreted out the truth, that her daughter [who was well known as the Eurasian courtesan of high demand] was a star vying to be one of the top beauties. She was even mentioned in the mosquito press. True, Lulu didn't have internet and google, but at the same time, Chinese people talk, servants gossip, and it wouldn't take a genius to go back to Shanghai to look for Violet's grave and find her instead plying her trade as a high demand courtesan.<br /><br />Add to the fact that Violet's father knew Violet was still alive AND he knew Lulu was distraught about losing Violet AND he lived in San Francisco where Lulu was, and you're telling me in what, 20 years, he never once lets Lulu know their daughter is alive because Violet once told him she hates her mother for abandoning her? So he respects her wishes not to talk about her mother anymore??? Can we just knock that man over the head with a 2 by 4 for stupidity?<br /><br />The other problem I had was plot structure. The rising tension was the question: will Violet ever find her mother again? Will she ever escape from the courtesan trade and later from her abusive husband? Will she find her daughter who had been kidnapped and brought to America?<br /><br />But the answer, when it came was already a letdown. After the daring escape from Moon Pond, Violet is going through her late husband's belongings when she conveniently finds a letter from her father saying her mother is sad that she lost Violet and never cared about the son she crossed the ocean to seek. Violet decides to contact her mother and find out her side of the story. They correspond and then her mother helps her find her daughter whom she easily locates and moves to their neighborhood. However, years literally go by from the time her daughter is seven until her daughter is a college student before they finally get together because the daughter was snooping while her adopted mother was away and found some letters intercepted by her adopted mother and decided to write back.<br /><br />The ending is a long set of drawn-out narratives as each woman tells the other two a summary of their life story, with Violet's daughter being the last one to speak. Lulu and Violet's daughter go back to America and Violet, Magic Gourd, and Violet's third husband stay behind. It was rather a sad, plodding ending.<br /><br />Although this may seem like a critical review, I gave it 5 stars for the historical detail, richness of description and extensive research that went into it. It is also literary fiction and not genre fiction, so I didn't want to mark itdown because it didn't have the plot and character elements of genre fiction [i.e. pacing, likeable characters, ending with all threads tied up.]<br /><br />The tragedy of these women is compounded by their inability to discern duplicity and their naive wish to put their trust in a man (basically an illusion), so while I might have made fun of them for not standing up for themselves or being more suspicious, their yearning for love and acceptance overwhelmed the advice of their sidekicks and the story ends in a way that resigns each woman to their fate. The American in me wishes for a fairytale ending, but the Chinese in me knows that happiness is fleeting and we need to grab ahold and savor those nuggets and be content.d in San Francisco where Lulu was, and you're telling me in what, 20 years, he never once lets Lulu know their daughter is alive because Violet once told him she hates her mother for abandoning her?

B006SV2LWA|5.0|I rate Contagion 5 stars (4.5 if I could) because it is believable. Such things *could* actually happen in real life.
B00DPUB56U|3.0|This movie was just OK, at least to me.  It is way too dark for my taste and by dark, I mean it looks as if they couldn't afford lighting.  The acting was good, the story line was OK and I really like vampire films, but this one was a bit too odd, at least for me.
0307346617|5.0|Great book - I only wish the movie lived up to this!  Brooks delivered this story very well, and it kept up as a page turner!  Thank you seller for quick shipment!
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|This was a good creepy movie with several of my favorite actresses.  The story was well written, the movie was well acted and it had some decent creepy moments in it.  I don't like to give away too much as you can read about it on IMDb and get more reviews as well, but if you like possession movies, then you really need to give this one a viewing.
B008R14YBK|5.0|My daughter knows ever word of this CD. It is a very good quality with very catchy tunes on it!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It's cool it love it, but at some points it's kind of bourding . It's fun. I would love to see a game though that doesn't have a special thing in it.
B000002LAC|5.0|Beautiful addition to my collection.  I've loved all three on singles for years, but now together - - -!  Their voices blend so well, that sometimes it is difficult to tell who is singing lead and who is on the harmony.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|I'm not coordinated enough for this game, but my young third cousins are (6 & 8 yrs old)  They both love this game.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|A return to their old sound, Black Sabbath sounds top notch. To be honest there's not a whole lot of things i will complain about. There is one thing, but its not the band's fault. Rick Rubin once again screws up another good album thanks to his assumption that we are all deaf or have day jobs working in a factory. There is little to no dynamic range in any of the songs and its kinda sad. Brad's drums sound small and wimpy. The vinyl version is only slightly better, the drums come out better but its still gives me fatigue from just listening to the whole thing. Everything sounds clipped too. Again, this is a great album i just wish they had released a remixed version that wasn't so brick-walled.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Not my type of game.  I guess I should say that my third cousins like it.  They are 6 and 8.
0770437400|4.0|“World War Z” is not meant to be a novel, and it is not exactly thrilling to read.  Perhaps the best way to describe it is to say it is an ethnological and anthropological thought experiment on the dangers and precariousness of globalization.<br /><br />Even though our medical establishment, technological progress, and scientific apparatus have reached an apex, we are less equipped and less ready to deal with a deadly virus than ever before.  That’s partly due to globalization (humans can span the globe in a matter of one day on a plane), partly due to urbanization (cities are perfect petri dishes for viruses), partly due to over-population (greater congestion in cities), and partly due to the inexorable human will to survive.  And while “World War Z” is both ambitious and epic in its reach and scope, it is the inexorable human will to survive that is on full frontal display.  The virus first spreads because those infected with it madly rush to safety in a last bid to survive, and it becomes a pandemic because the world refuses to wake up from the narrow comfort zone people cling desperately to and imagine the absolute danger that the virus represents.  And the virus is finally stopped because humans need to and will survive despite incompetent government, scarce resources, widespread fear, and general hopelessness.<br /><br />“World War Z” can both be exhilarating and exhausting read because it’s really a collection of snippets from a vast array of individuals who experience firsthand the coming of the zombies, and the upending of the existing social order.  Immigrant maids teach their Hollywood executive employers useful survival skills in their broken English, and Cuba becomes the world’s most vibrant economy, causing boatloads of American refugees to flee to its shores.<br /><br />Each nation responds to the zombie crisis in their own manner, betraying the certain mannerisms and habits that betray their culture.  China, where the outbreak firstoccurs, refuses at first to acknowledge that there is actually an outbreak, and provokes a Taiwan strait crisis to distract the world’s attention.  Russia is brutal and tyrannical in its response before finally turning to religion.  Israel is the first and the most ready to respond to the threat because it thinks about the possibility of its own extinction everyday.  The black leaders of South Africa must re-discover the country’s apartheid past in order to save its multi-racial future.<br /><br />Max Brooks is a well-traveled and well-read man who has been thinking both about zombies and about globalization for many years now, and “World War Z” is a feast for those who love zombies and those who are naturally curious of and afraid for the world we live in today.
B00868AF9O|5.0|I love this book.  Better than the Marley movie and Ole Yeller.  Or at least should be on the shelf next to them.  Labs rule.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love this movie.  Phantom of the Opera is one of my favorite Broadway shows.  This movie will not disappoint. It captures your attention from the first scene to the last.
0062107313|5.0|Yes, the book is long. Yes, it took me 2 weeks to read. Yet the time was well worth it.<br /><br />I have read other books by other authors that take place in China (I am infatuated with their culture's traditions and lifestyle) and there is something to be said about the mother and daughter or mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship. What readers have to remember is, sure this story has been told over and over, but not in the same way. If someone were to look at books taking place in the US, I'm sure they'd could say we have the same story too.<br /><br />Amy Tan has a way of storytelling that grabs you and brings you in, and this book does not disappoint. At times I was upset with Violet and other times I pitied her. I thought her mother, Lucretia was foolish for believing Fairweather, but yet haven't we all made mistakes that were blatantly obvious to others?<br /><br />This is a review of lives intertwined spanning almost 5 decades. The lesson I learned from it all was this: Life has its good and bad (obviously) but  if you really look at all the miracles that have happened, they couldn't have happened without the obstacles along the path. We all learn lessons the hard way and Amy Tan's characters are no different.<br /><br />I thought the ending was perfect. I have read some other reviews that thought it was predictable and pat. I personally didn't think so but that is just my humble opinion...

B002RL7W9W|5.0|A must have for all those who intend to invade the rebel base on Hoth.<br /><br />One can hardly go wrong with Legos, except for the fact that they're usually unspeakably expensive. The nice thing about this tiny set is that it's on the cheaper side. Okay, so it was on the cheaper side when it came out. It's an older model (2-ish years), so they're probably going to overcharge for it, but there are probably sets to be found on obscure toy store shelves somewhere.<br /><br />Lego does a great job with bringing out new sets each year. As long as the star wars franchise remains profitable for it, you can rest assured that new sets will pop up. True collectors will probably go broke trying to get everything, but it's fun to try.<br /><br />As for fun, the snow troopers look especially menacing.<br />As with all normal Legos, not for the super young as there are a lot of small parts.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|My nephew loves minecraft.  He put together the original lego minecraft, and he really enjoyed it.  I'm sure this will be a hit.  No problems with shipping
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I haven't noticed a huge difference between my memories of vhs and this blu-ray, but let's face it, it's been over a decade since I saw the classic star wars movies.<br /><br />The movies are definitely dated at this point, but if you were a star wars fan before, I don't see how you could possibly be disappointed with the fact that they made it clearer.<br /><br />I am disappointed that there's not the older version with the ewok party and song, but hey, can't have everything in life.<br /><br />Perfect keepsake for indoctrinating (I mean enlightening) all those friends who were deprived of basking in star wars as kids.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|After a almost GB download I am unable to get past the character creation screen since it won't bring up a keyboard to let me create a name or anything . Lack of response from devs show how little they care
B007FG9LIE|5.0|The story of Wayward Pines grabs the reader from the first page. Imagine finding yourself in a town where nothing is what it seems. I hope this book becomes a movie.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very interesting story and very well narrated. Am going to watch the movie next to see how Richard Parker and Pi look.

B004EPYZUS|4.0|yeah he is aging, still another &#34;impossible&#34; movie as he does stuff that you're like ok how is he alive from that? I say he has one more in him. He need other actors by his side like the female actress whatever her name is was just so blabla. The ending was ok.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Same thing over and over again as you advance in the levels.  They get so hard it forces you to buy things to help you get through them.

B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I don't know why I'm rating this, I didn't ever buy this.  At least I don't think I did.  Maybe in a previous life.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am completely addicted as I knew I would. I never got a chance to watch the show when it first aired season 1 so I dismissed it knowing I'd never have the time to catch up. Well, I caught up on all 3 seasons in one weekend! I couldn't stop watching. This is the best 1900's soap opera I have ever seen. Drama upstairs, drama downstairs, it always keeps you on the edge of your seat! It a must see, but I warn you, once you start you can't stop.
0812983459|5.0|If you haven't read this lovely book, you must!  I loved the characters, and was touched by their various journeys.  I kept thinking of The Short Happy Life of Francis MacComber!
1250038820|4.0|Very nicely done and it makes a really great conversation piece.  The pictures are nice and colorful.  However, some of the text on the captions aren't as easily readable because of the color choice.  Otherwise, it was well worth the money.
B0041KVZ1S|5.0|You can call it a mess and all the dirty words you can dish out but at the end of the day it's a very solid album from start to finish Phil Spector did a wonderful job on this one if you compare it to LIB naked you will notice and even feel somthing is missing and it's a little somthing called soul the naked album is good for new Beatle listeners but us the that went to the store and bought it brand new could tell you the original is best by far not to knock McCartney but this time he had it all wrong he was just thinking solo I have every single official lp and 45 ever made by the Beatles take my word for it even the solo of let it be yells this is the way it should be no matter if the apple is green or red
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|The number one reason to get it:  Original price 14.99, current price 0.99.  I bought it because it was cheap.  this will come in handy if I decide I need to edit something on the go (although I prefer the laptop over tablets).
B00BPLDCVM|1.0|Just seeing what is listed here, I wouldn't bother. The theme isn't the original...I don't generally care for remixes. The song from the end of the first episode of season one isn't on there...&#34;Space Junk&#34;...or even &#34;The Regulator&#34; by Clutch. There are other favorites not on this album. What were they thinking?!!

B000022TSH|5.0|Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score and particularly, the haunting main tile , played so feelingfully by trumper Uan Rasey<br />is unforgettable and a perfect musical setting for this great film.
B00EI4V3X2|1.0|First, let me start by saying that I had very high expectations for this headset.  Turtle Beach advertised this headset prior to its release as a multi-platform headset with Bluetooth capability.  When the headset arrived, I was very pleased.  The presentation was nice, materials felt sturdy and well built.  It didn't appear to be cheaply made.  I first set it up with my brand new PS4.  Oops, the wireless mic doesn't work.  You have to plug in a cable to the controller because they developed the technology without testing it first.  Then, I tried to use it for my Xbox 360.  It didn't surprise me that I needed a cable as the 360 is old and it's Microsoft.  However, once I plugged it in and tried to play online with some friends, I quickly learned that there is NO functioning chat volume control.  You can control how loud your voice is in the headset and how loud the game volume is.  But they did not include any mechanism for controlling chat volume, and apparently the default volume is set to 11 out of 10.  I nearly blew my ear drums out when I was testing it.  The chat volume functions on the side of the headphone are only for bluetooth, and have nothing to do with in game volume.  This product fails on every aspect that it was advertised for.  Can you plug it in and hear game content on PS4 and XBOX, sure.  Can you adjust chat volume or use the wireless microphone to chat on PS4 or XBOX, nope.  Useless.
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|Love it. Beautiful Christmas songs by a fantastic artist. What a fabulous voice. If you are a Barbra fan, you'll love it.

B00GX50BD2|3.0|This movie was ok but there really was no true character substance to the portrayal of Steve Jobs.  This should have been more aptly titled&#34; &#34;Apple, and their rise, fall, and .....&#34;  As that is all we really see.  We learn that Jobs was obsessive, like to garden, had a 'baby mama' that apparently slept around (or, he thought she did), was comfortable not being at Apple on the outside, but truly was laying and waiting to return.<br /><br />Now, we all know what he did when he returned, but it would have been nice to see how he pulled off ITune turning the music industry into his pawns etc.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy this game!!! I just wish they updated the game every few months &amp; added some more exciting levels.

B0013F1D02|3.0|Full of potential...but not worth watching a second time. Cheesy acting, flat script, corny comedy attempts, lame special effects and choppy editing. Could have been so much more.

B001DHXT6G|1.0|This thing was horrible. The series is a great series but the set I received, which the seller claimed was brand new, had about 75% of the discs scratched and unwatchable. It would have cost me money to return it and so I just kept it.
B008JFUS28|1.0|One of the worst movies of 2013, this is the second chapter in the adventures of Thor the Cosmic Douchebag and his magical hammer. Spoiler alert: this is the one where, despite living for thousands of years, with a duty to protect all life in the whole universe, he falls in love with Jane, a human mortal who will die in about 40 years. She also happens to be Earth’s dumbest astrophysicist.<br /><br />But I’m getting ahead of myself. The movie begins a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, where some bad guys are fighting some good guys. You can tell who the bad guys are because they are called Dark Elves. Their warriors are called Kursed, and they are apparently the only beings in the entire universe that don’t speak English.  Anyway, the Dark Elves want to take some red mist called the Aether, which is “the most powerful weapon in the universe”, and kill everyone (yes, there’s a lot of talk about “the universe” in this movie. You can’t get more epic than that.) Luckily, Thor’s grandfather wins, and hides “the most powerful weapon in the universe” in a rock.<br /><br />Fast forward to present day. Some kind of “convergence of the Nine Realms of the universe” is getting ready to happen, and it’s focused on England. This makes parts of Earth act all wacky. Jane’s science team finds one of these places - if you throw things into it, it makes them disappear. So they decide to throw their car keys into it. Then Jane decides to wander off by herself. She runs into the rock that hides the Aether, and it infects her, which wakes up the bad guys. Then some other stuff happens that is even less believable.<br /><br />Visually, the movie is interesting. Even though a lot of it is copied from Star Wars movies, it’s still fun to let it bounce off your eyeballs. Unfortunately, that’s the only positive thing I can say about the movie. The script is not just bad, it’s embarrassing. For a plot that revolves around the laws of physics, none of the three screenwriters seem to have heard of it (pro tip, guys: putting the word “quantum” in front of other words doesn’t count as an explanation. Oh, and a physicist would never exclaim, “It will tear the fabric of reality apart!”).<br /><br />Thor is such a fratboy Superhero that it’s impossible to take him seriously. He tosses his hair around, flexes his muscles, and likes to party. He stops wars and saves the day multiple times on multiple planets, but then he gets all weepy over some puny earth girl that he just met and who will be dead before he has time to hit the gym.<br /><br />The movie is stupid, silly, and boring. It has about as much suspense and depth as a television commercial. The cinematic equivalent of a pony keg of Keystone Light, it will actually make you dumber by consuming it.the three screenwriters seem to have heard of it (pro tip, guys: putting the word “quantum” in front of other words doesn’t count as an explanation.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This Chromescast is pretty awesome. Id recommend it. You will turn your flat screen into a Smart TV essentially. Keep in mind, you have to have the chromecast plugged into the HDMI and USB cable. They sort if misrepresent this fact. You should have a USB near your HDMI port on your TV, if not you have to have it plugged into the wall.<br /><br />Also, you need the Chrome Browser on your computer to cast non Cast video sources such as Sho Go or any website other than Netflix or Youtube which has the button to Cast directly. With the Chromescast extension you can cast anything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Plus you can still use your browser while in FULL SCREEN Mode. JUST PRESS THE WINDOWS BUTTON!!! Best tip I can give you. I have my phone, kindle and laptop all setup to cast to my CHROMEY (thats my Chromecasts name..LOL). Buy IT now if you need it. I stop playing online games on my Xbox and only watched Netflix and Vudu with it.  The Chromecast has allowed me to ELIMINATE my XBOX LIVE SUBSCRIPTION!!!

B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Just as good as seasons 1,2,3 - seasons not over so it's hard to give it a rating of 5 just yet.  Enjoying every minute.  The story twists and turns, but it's sure to satisfy.
B0061S0A64|4.0|I have this installed on my Kindle fire hd and my Samsung galaxy III  tablets, and I enjoy tinkering around with it. don't know if there are any kind of instructions (I didn't really look), and it's not exactly intuitive, but I've never been afraid to just push buttons. A lot of it does sound the same, but that's fixable for the most part by changing the type of scale.<br />All in all, it's a time-eater, but I'm okay with that.
B00CHCUR9I|1.0|This title, and a number of others Walking Dead issues, won't download.  The first clue appears when it doesn't recognize my account as having a compatible device.  Because the title is a Kindle edition, I'm guessing that for some reason it isn't available for earlier Fire (mine's a 1st generation Fire).
B001LF3YQK|4.0|Keeps the wipes moist and compact. Fits very well in our diaper bag. The only downside is it is a little on the heavy side.

0062107313|2.0|I've been semi-patiently waiting for this book since March, when I read Tan's [[ASIN:B006F5SUP6 Rules for Virgins (Kindle Single)]], which was available as an electronic excerpt of \\"The Valley of Amazement.\\" As a longtime fan, I was especially happy to see that the final page count topped 600 -- plenty of room for Tan to explore character interaction and development against a vivid, scenic, bustling backdrop.<br /><br />Thus, it is very difficult to make myself link \\"mediocre\\" and \\"Amy Tan\\" in the same sentence. She provides multisensory details of Shanghai and other venues. Several moments and turns of phrase crackle with vintage Tan energy and insight. And  certainly she develops and fleshes out several main characters so that you'd recognize them from across the proverbial crowded room. Even so, there is a sense of clich&eacute; that is hard to minimize or disregard. Yes, a flawed character can seem more human, and these flaws can contribute to the flow of a story. However, I was deeply disappointed to find that most of these characters' flaws and foibles did not make them sympathetic. Quite the opposite, in fact. I found myself hoping that several characters might develop more likeability along the way, but unfortunately they did not. As a result, it was difficult to become invested in them and lose myself in the story despite the sweep and opulence of the setting.<br /><br />For a loose, non-spoiler parallel, consider the character of Scarlett O'Hara in \\"Gone with the Wind.\\" At the outset, Scarlett is interesting but not necessarily likeable. As life buffets her and she makes choices, the reader may not agree with those choices and may find the effect on Scarlett's character and some of her future actions distasteful, but Scarlett does evolve. Through most of the book, I found myself unwillingly drawing parallels between and among Scarlett and the mother (Lulu) and daughter (Violet) in this story and waiting for them to evolve, as well. Unfortunately, the structure and story arc did not progress in a way that enabled any meaningful character growth. While I deeply respect Amy Tan as an author, I became increasingly frustrated by some of the choices she made for her characters, especially in the later parts of the book.<br /><br />In sum, if you are a fan of Amy Tan, you will find flashes of her adept storytelling, especially early in the book, during Violet's youth. However, you may be disappointed in the pacing and in the relative paucity of meaningful interaction between mother and daughter (heretofore a Tan hallmark). As noted, Tan's eye and ear for detail are sharp, and she evokes several settings quite vividly. Thus, I would give this book a tepid endorsement for those who've been waiting for the next Amy Tan tale. However, if you are new to her writing, you owe it to yourself and to her to begin with an earlier book.nd story arc did not progress in a way that enabled any meaningful character growth.

B00GO95TAC|5.0|One of the best Doctor Who Specials to date, I loved seeing Tennant back again as the 10th Doctor, I was a little disappointed in &#34;Rose's&#34; character, because I was expecting her to be the actual Rose companion.  Other than that small disappointment, I was blown away by this episode and can't wait to see the XMas episode this month.  And, to all the people giving this one star because they felt the price was too high, that seems a bit strange.  A review is supposed to tell you if you liked something or not, are most people's pleasures relative to price?  I find that I either like or dislike something, regardless of price paid.  If Total Relative Pleasure received = Actual Pleasure MINUS Cost, then by that logic, the Mona Lisa is a terrible painting because its &#34;priceless&#34; and therefore its price is infinity, and no amount of pleasure would ever offset the price.<br /><br />I find this ironic considering most people pay over $100 a month for full package cable television (which you need to include BBC America), so I guess 7 dollars doesn't really seem like that much for an episode that only occurs every 50 years.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A bull's eye hit.<br />This story is so brilliant and warm.The modern western society's understanding or rather lack of understanding of old people's needs and opinion is unvailed in a very humorous way.
B00GX59QO2|2.0|The plot  is really absurd, even for a movie of this sort, and leaves major gaps in what's going on and why.  It's not nearly as funny as the first RED, and the humor seems stilted and stale.  I'd pass on this one.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Steelheart is a very good YA novel. It is not as polished as Sanderson's Stormlight Archives novel, but it is well written. The characters are relatable and realistic. The dialogue is great. I would recommend Steelheart to anyone interested in reading Brandon Sanderson who wants to start on a smaller book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was a good story and you will enjoy reading it. It ends fairly well and it has twists and turns that you won't expect.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|For some reason I was skeptical if this movie it seemed they were building it up to much, and frankly loking at the preview  I didn't get it. I was wrong I found it very enteraining and out of the box ans it has a mesaage to boot.  In the back of  my mind I kpet thinking Jennifer Lawernce is to young for this role Bradley Cooper is much older I believe but she pulls it off nicely. Speaking Bradley he is amazing, perhaps his best role. Deniro is back in form. Two other actors, whose name escape me were equally brilliant and I enjoy over and over, his best friend who appeared in &#34;Pride and Glory&#34; and the Mom from &#34;Animal Kingdom&#34; (Australian Movie) are the icing on the cake.  Bottom line it is good to see Mr Cooper outside the &#34;Hunk&#34; fest and palying a less than glamorous role.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|SYCAMORE ROW by John Grisham deeply touched me. American history holds secrets too shameful to share; so I read about them in the dark. This story being too compelling to put down to sleep. Thank you Mr. Grisham for spinning these secrets through out this book, jarring a bit more reality into the picture I have of our past.<br /><br />Read this now. You cheat yourself if your pass it by.  Kaye Agle 2013
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I like to hear from both characters not just the woman. This book gave me that and also the quick marriage is a plus.<br />But I prefer the guy to be more real. Do they always have to be rich and gorgeous? I cannot stand an arrogant man. Stoic, strong, protective, sweet, honest, that is a man. She should stand her ground and not melt so easy. I like the woman to be strong, smart, and doesn't deny her feelings to get him to win her heart(yuck). She should be out of the ordinary and gutsy. A little comedy and adventure. Maybe some mystery and I love period pieces. No sex. That is just how I feel.
B00DPH7QFM|3.0|Musically this show was very tight. Blackmore was polished and of course a virtuoso, a master of his Fender. But, the energy that used to be so emblematic to Blackmore's Rainbow and of course Deep Purple was not there anymore. I could notice the lack of chemistry between Blackmore and White, although White had a great vocal performance, his showmanship was artificial and unwelcome.He Simply put, was not getting through the crowd. Lucky for him he was backed by the big name of the man in Black himself..<br /><br />But then again, if you just buy this DVD to enjoy the music and song selection, I think you will enjoy it. Great sound and a good show overall.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I have had no crashing or glitching problems, it runs very smoothly. The actual game itself is insanely fun. the concept is really different, and only adds cool factor to the game. I have never regretted getting the game.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|I'm a huge Darius Rucker fan and loved him when he was with Hootie too.  I could not pass up this deal at this wonderful price.  Totally awesome and an amazing deal to boot!
B007HUD6OS|5.0|The first, second, and third book, got based loaded, this one brought them all home! With suspense, happiness, sadness, and Theo, John Grisham has written an incredible book about kids fighting for what they want! I highly recommend it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this and want t read I again. Well written and engaging.  I definitely recommend this touching book. Great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|We need 0.8.0 update before Christmas 2013, please. It would be really helpful to all the people who have this game.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This story covered a wide range of attitudes and many diverse characters. The story presented several different characters or families and how they reacted to the loss of a family member. It moves back and in time to help make connections related to a tragedy and how chance, complexities of Law, and courage figure in to the situation.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun game but please don't keep erasing my points and coins every time I want to upgrade to the next town in the game. Thanks for reading this message··}
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This an okay game to play with your friends. It is not the safest game because it allows you to play with other people [strangers] everybody knows the saying: &#34;Stranger Danger&#34;. The game lasts about 1 week and then it freezes up whenever you try to get back on it and play again.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|its so challenging to play<br />gets u interested<br />and it is a really funny vid plus it sends a good message&#34;be safe around trains&#34;

B00594XOZU|4.0|its ok and kinda fun i mean like its not that diffremt from txting on ur own phone,  ut itz really good txting material
B00G32QIEG|4.0|My family liked it. It is very similar to the MIB movies but to be honest i liked this more than the MIB movies. Good movie for us.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I never get tired of playing this game it's very addicting just an awesome game hdhgshhzgsgsvvshggshgshhshshhg(rushes hashish gangbusters  hhshhshsbhhs hhshhshsbhhs hshhs
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My grandson loves this movie and all it's music as much as my children did when they were little...I still love it!
B002FQOI0A|5.0|i really like stories about interesting lives young and old. I also enjoy the different perspectives. I reccomend this book to all ypung readers
B0055SWM08|5.0|The music is nice and relaxing when you play the game, the game its self is really good. Get it if you are have interest in it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|after debating alot with myself abt either to get roku, other streaming devices or chromecast.. decided to get this.. its simply awesome. it worked seamlessly with my vixio and samsung tv's and I was worried that my bad internet connection would be issue.. but worked far better then I had expected.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|a beautifully written story which informs about the best and the worst in human nature and made me cry for all of us in our clumsy,messy<br />living of our lives.<br /><br />a
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Appeal is to the 12 to 21 set.  I did not see anything really extraordinary.  The portrayal of the elite was very cheesy, silly to the point of being ridiculous.  Miss Lawrence did a good job of acting.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|addicting!<br />levels and very similar to bejeweled<br />curious to compare the two.<br />late night, can put me to sleep with ease!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|My 5 yr old grandson loves this!! It is easy for him to use too. You should give it a try.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|I don't think this movie was critically acclaimed :-), but I have to say I laughed out loud several times in the theater. I rented it from Amazon during the holidays to watch with my daughter who was home on college break.<br />She laughed a lot and I laughed like I hadn't seen it before. If you want a laugh, this will do it.  Disclaimer though: my husband refused to watch it. LOL.
0385537131|2.0|Terrribly disappointed.  Only got good in the last few pages and even then was predictable.  cant compare to the firm or the associate, no thriller element at all.
1476734941|5.0|This is an easy to follow diet.  I have been on Weight Watchers for years and have been able to stay within my goal weight but really wanted to lose another 10 lbs.  After 2 mos on the Fast Diet, I have lost the 10 lbs.  I feel great and my hubby says I look great!
B00425S1H8|5.0|You plug it in and it works with windows 8. I had no problems with the device. Made my life easy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is a master at this genre.  He's about the only author that I will purchase even though the Kindle edition is more expensive that the new hardcover version.  Ford County MUST be a real place.
0375869026|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever. It is intended for a young audience (I am 50). My niece read it in 5th grade, and wants to read it again (which says a lot - she doesn't love reading). RJ Palacio writes in a way that all characters can be understood and shows us that there are multiple sides to every story. I can remember when I have read about a character with so much heart, humility and strength of character in a while. It should be read by EVERYONE! It has such a great message - I think that it should be compulsory reading in all 5th grade classrooms.
0803726570|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my cousin's baby shower. It was a big hit, and she appreciate the book. It's sure to become THE go-to bed time story! Even my cousin's mother (comparable to the wicked witch of the west) enjoyed it and thought it a clever gift. It definitely has a good moral message as well. Help those when you can, because you never know when the favor will be returned.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It was ok, it gets boring.  The minions cost too much money to buy.  I've seen better, i've seen worse.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love how easy it can be for children!!!! the kids love it and if they ever get stuck,  momma is there to help
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|U have to have the tokens to play the game and u get five when they run out  u can watch a 30 second video well after awhile u can't watch any video's and so u can't play the game until this certain time.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Need to ask the rep of kindle to add this on for me because it wanted me to pay for the item. I was told why I needed because it was charging me to download it. One-day it was on my kindle. Funny.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use and I love the fact that I can pick different version of the bible if I don't understand the version I am using at that time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book as part of my summer reading list in middle or high school. It has always been one of my favorite books.  I read it again after watching the movie and was reminded as an adult how awesome it still is. :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am hooked along with all my friends and family. Love the game and think everyone should be playing, I want more lives and extra moves the more friends playing the better I like it...  :)
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Watching these giant Mechs was a lot of fun. The logic and plot holes in this was a bit comical. REally they spend so much money on these films and can't hire someone to think.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book was just amazing. My English teacher recommend it to us and it was just s sweet. The only problems were that there was a lot of swearing and it starte off slow but again, it was just breathtaking.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Acting OK, Special effects cool, but the changes to the Star Trek Universe and the logic and plot holes are a tragedy. Sloppy work.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|No joke. Super easy to use and it worked. Gave me quicker web speed and more memory space. I highly suggest you try it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I can't wait till the sequel!  Very believable.  Characters well developed.  Also the author has given the reader an interesting world..
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I don't usually leave reviews but I feel like so many people are giving this book bad reviews and it's really not that awful. The ending makes since if you think about their actions and through out the book, that doesn't mean I like the ending any better tho.<br /><br />Anyways here's my review I'll keep it short and to the point :)<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in this last book. I was shocked about the obvious parts And wish she hadn't ended the book like that. (Trying not to give spoilers) However the book did clear up a lot of questions that lingered from the beginning, which was nice. But I would of still liked to see more action and some better development in Tris and Tobias relationship.<br /><br />I would still recommend this trilogy to a friend, the last book may not have been as I wanted it to be but it was still a wonderful and entertaining trilogy over all.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is ok but some levels are simply impossible to complete.  Like level 78, why can't I clear the cherries and the other fruits when they're stuck on both corners? There should be a help guide somewhere for glitches like that.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a GREAT app!  Alarms to remind me of recording times.  Allows me to listen to or record from an area that's not affected by blackouts, outages, or whatever in my local area.  If my local station fades, I can switch to Tune-In Radio and get my broadcast back.  Invaluable.  Absolutely love this app!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have played this before on my laptop with my children and I have to say I am very impressed. But, needless to say that since they loved Bloons TD 1 and 2 they liked it on the kindle as number 5! Keeps them busy and they have fun with it!
B00000JNO1|3.0|This was Skynyrd's third record, and it's it's ok with a few cool songs, but it's nothing like the first two.  You can see why it wasn't terribly well received.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|As a firm believer and writer in encouraging people to follow their dreams, I enjoyed this book tremendously. If you are a  person who hasn't the desire to follow his or her  dreams and live a life you  have always to wanted to live because of fear or discouragement, this is the book for you. Anyone would enjoy reading this book, as it will enlighten them and give them the courage to trod forward and meet their goals. Thank you Mr. Coelho for your inspiring words.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I have become a Downton Abbey fan.  The play between the downstairs house staff and upper classes view a life past or maybe not.  I was sad when Sybil died.  Lady Mary I'm torn-- do I like her or not? And Maggie Smith is priceless.
B008C2GVUG|5.0|Best movie. So happy to finally get this one on Blu Ray! What more can I say? I have not checked out the extra features yet, but they look great.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|one of my favorite games I have found. miniclip and ndemic did a wonderful job. very realistic and addictive. hope to see more
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Enjoyed the entire Divergent series. All the books kept your attention and made you wanting more. Also truly enjoyed the ending.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|Good read - Makes you think outside of the laws of physics box. Interesting concepts while not all new are well articulated in this book.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|I like the way the app works. Easy to use. I would like to see more drum patterns. Enlarge the visible metronome for Droid.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining was one of my all time favorite books.  I did not want to have high hopes for this one, so I began the book with an open mind.  Mr. King did not disappoint me.  I like all the characters and all their many different personalities.
B007URVZJ6|2.0|I still found it confusing, yet bits and pieces of information was helpful. Maybe an &#34;idiot's guide&#34; would fit me better.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This book starts slowly.  Harry Bosch is a complex man and a driven skilled detective.  Half way through the story the pace picks up.<br />His personal story contributes to this being more than a crime story.  It exemplifies free will in determining who we become and how we live our lives.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|It was a pretty fun movie. Probably not for everyone but if you think that it's fun to do bad things and you have a sense of humor, give it a try.
B000QE9ERK|4.0|Lansk il just let me say I am a big johnny depp Fan  And I first waTched this movie when it came out back in the nineties.still pretty good here In 2013 but you know how things loose their luster over the years. still I would give it a very good rating.. taUT tense thriller and I enjoyed watching it again. never seen a roman Polanski film I did not enjoy. if you enjoy this type of particular Genre, then I would recommend yes for 2 hours of viewing pleasure
B00AGH5LF6|5.0|Home alone is a classic... Home Alone 2 is just more fun off that classic... great stuff... It never gets old.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Takes a bit long to load, but that's because the graphics are all great. Well thought out game, how they come out with more levels.
B00E8B1358|5.0|I like the effects of this movie. And I also like the advanced technology shown in this movie! The movie is almost like mixture of Action movies. By this, I mean that the movie has Kung-Fu Action, Military Action, Sci-Fi Action, and Street-Action. Because of that, this movie is the best. I also like the part when Zartan is devastated London! Because of the advanced technology used in the movie, I rate this movie 5 stars!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Great game, I'm basically obsessed with it and can't stop playing. Always trying to get to 1%, the only bad thing, don't know how many hours I've spent playing it instead of working!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A great book. Twists and turns till until the very end. Loved the follow on to A Time To Kill.
B00EZZ77ZM|5.0|I love this album!!!<br />It's a bit sad that its so short (some of the songs) but they are all so good
B0037B6QSY|5.0|A beautiful masterpiece...I would recommend it to anybody interested in the path of mindfulness. Gives a clear understanding of what it means to live in the present.
B00G3P6VA4|1.0|Neil Blomkamp's second feature film, Elysium, is not as good as District 9,&#34; one reviewer says.  No kidding!  This film, despite Matt Damon's solid performance, is an embarrassment.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I was very happy when black friday came along and this game became free. Don't hate ninja kiwi for making it free, they are trying to be nice.
B003405MF6|2.0|How the mighty have fallen!  Beck blazes no new ground here. I used to love his Fusion work back in the 80s.  I used to keep his &#34;Who Else&#34; album in steady rotation in my play list for years....this album is a dust collector.
B008LXZFH6|1.0|I wish I could give it minus 10.  It was soooo stupid.  Turned it off after half an hour.  High school trash humor.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A friend recommended this book and mentioned it was on sale a few days ago. I downloaded it immediately and read it in one sitting. I have not felt this connected to a story in a long time. Hazel and Augustus are amazing characters. I knew I would be crying at the end of the book.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|This album has quickly become my favorite one I bought this year. Jake Bugg sounds a lot like it came out ot the 60's folk era with just enough modern in it that once you listen to it you want to just start over.<br /><br />For me it was hearing Lighting Bolt on the radio that attracted me to Jake Bugg in the first place. I hope he can continue to produce albums that are this fun to listen to in the future.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|this has to be the worst cinema graphically challenged action movie I have ever seen.  the producer should be shot for making this movie and be ashamed at allowing this off the cutting room floor. now I love action flicks and I don't watch them for the acting but this ... DON'T RENT IT
B0039USJMY|5.0|I bought this for my wife. She plays it all the time. I enjoyed the history and pageantry.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game had some hard levels, but it is very fun and everybody likes it a lot.So I think it is very cool.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|great movie, love the suspense, sit and watch it over and over.  My guess love it when they came to visit and watch it.
B007T99ENE|1.0|I tried very hard to get into this book, but stopped reading halfway through. It dragged on so slowly and was completely boring
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great item.  I can now watch my streaming TV shows on the big screen TV.  Has been working for several months with no issues.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I hate getting locked out. Frustrating fun I guess. It is stupid that you can't just buy the app. No more dollars for lives. Irritating.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Easily the best book of the Hunger Games series. It is amazing and has a huge plot twist near the end.
B007REV4YI|4.0|More in keeping with the original Bond style. Memorable lines, much better plot base, and a glimpse into the life of a 007 agent.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Great series, a good bit of repetition though. By the time you get to the last book, you don't feel like reading it anymore.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Awesome game. Would recommend this game to anyone who likes side scrollers and the teenage mutant ninja turtles.  Turtle time yo!!
0786962984|4.0|Great for encouraging my 9-year old to put down the video game controller and practice some practical math and develop some financial planning and risk management decision skills.  For most RPG gamers (whether live or video game), it is a bit simple and lacks any tactics or role-playing aspects. Other reviews have mentioned making add-on house rules to introduce a bit more complexity and encourage cooperative/team play - something we'll definitely be looking at if we play this again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had high expectations for Season 2 since I had quickly become a fan of Season 1.  It definitely did not disappoint.  I could not stop watching.  Romance, war, dysfunctional family--it's all there.
B00003CX8U|5.0|This is truly a classic. There is a solid story line and wonderful character development. The music is great and so is the dancing. I seldom buy DVD's- but we got the movie from Netflix because we hadn't watched it in years- literally- I knew right away that this is a movie I'll watch again and I wanted to own it.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I love this movie! if you enjoy comic books you will enjoy this movie. Has good action and some funny lines
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm not a music critic, but I love the music and lyrics on this album. So much so that I also bought The Open Door- Evanescence is one of my latest favorite musical groups. There is something haunting about their music- I feel like I can listen to it whenever.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I used this ap to restore a very old picture, it worked wonders! The filters helped to add definition and it actually looked &quot;professionally done.&quot; I would definitely recommend it.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|I love the music- I got the soundtrack as well- most if not all of the songs are covers of older songs- for example White Rabbit- but the style is completely different. I don't know if this is one of those really bad movies you just want to watch over and over again- kind of like Dirty Dancing- but I just watch it over and over again. I'm not sure what to make of it- what is reality and what is fantasy- but the music is key to the whole story- which is probably why I like it so much.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Almost fills the void a real horse would. I love this game and its a lot of fun. I highly recommend it to other horse lovers out there.
B001MYIQK4|5.0|If you like Downton Abby you will love this.  Great plot, excellent character development.  Amazing storyline that will keep you on the seat.
B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|Post apocalyptic tale, rather meandering through the story of one of the central characters, Zeb.  It's a little predictable in terms of the villians vs. the good guys.  I found it easier to put down than the first two books and, by this third book, I was very sick of the institutions and creatures of the final days of civilization and beyond.
B0037Z95Z6|5.0|If you like Downton Abby you will love this. If you like Downton Abby you will love this.  Great plot, excellent character development.  Amazing storyline that will keep you on the seat.
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|The whole family went to see it.  It was amazing!  Very funny and heart warming. The soundtrack is fabulous.  The kids sang it all weekend.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|He does it again with a book that teaches you more history then you learn in school and wish all history books were this interesting and informative on the nitty gritty of how and why it happened. More please. Will go back and re-read. Just terrific.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book had some story twists that i didn't see coming. The first two books are all about Tris while this books switches between her and Tobias. This story is more about their relationship and diffrent choices they make. The ending..... oh the ending was heart breaking.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|the movie was ok, it didnt live upto superman film. only bright side of the movie is russel crow. dont make sequel for this series.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It's a decent game for a buck. I really dig the map. It's a good way to kill time. Worked well on kindle fire.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really loved this book, it's a real page-turner and the character is really touching. I highly recommend this book!
0375869026|4.0|R.J. Palacio has created a character to love and admire in 10 year old Auggie - and his loyal friends. You will laugh and cry as Auggie navigates a new world that is often cruel and embracing. As the mother of a 10 year old boy, I so felt the pain of Auggie's rejection and the pain of not being able to make his world free from this pain or of his unfortunate disfigurement. I was horrified trying to piece together just how awful Auggie's face is and wondered how I, or my son, would react in such a situation. A great topic for discussion between me and my son.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars except for 2 issues for me. The author alternates in first person between multiple narrators and this works - but there are too many voices. I felt if she had selected 3 (Auggie, a friend, Auggie's sister) we would have enough of other points of view to see Auggie's world full circle. Also, the kids are 10 year olds in 5th grade but they seemed like 6th or even 7th graders with much older conversations than I hear 10 year olds having and especially navigating the dating world. I just couldnt suspend disbelief over that and kept thinking they were 12 or 13.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a &#34;wonder&#34; and so is Auggie.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|True to the book. A bit choppy though. Got for my spouse to view as we were going to see the new &#34;Catching Fire&#34; movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and my high score is 47,994 it is my favorite game and the best game I ever saw
B00EEXPDTM|5.0|Very good in depth look at her life and how porn was back in the early days. It shows the behind the scenes look that we never see or heard about back then.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works great and easy to use which is important for older users,  I highly recommend to at least give it a try you will like it.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Just too much foul language.  The story would have been much better told without the nudity and foul language. asdfasdfasdfasdf
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game was very fun and has a wide variety of maps that you earn by having Fun in the game also it has power ups that you can buy with the bananas that u earn by running
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Pictures need to be larger, items so small and missed easily.  Would like it better, if picture was larger and easier to see.
006202406X|1.0|This series could've gone down as one of the best Young Adult trilogies in recent memory. Veronica Roth had other ideas instead. If you forget the last 100 pgs of Allegiant, it is still only a 2-3 star book. I felt that the book was very slow and monotonous at times and that not a lot happened compared to the first two books. Four's point of view was awful to read and made me almost dislike him as a character. It also made it impossible to get into the book with the constant changing of POVs. Once you take the end into consideration it becomes a book worth 0 stars. Too bad I can't give that rating.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|This series is one of my favorites.  Got caught out to lunch without a book and was able to call this up on my phone's Kindle App - gotta love technology!  Philip Pullman launches the reader directly into this other-world so that as you follow the story you uncover the facts of this world naturally without a lot of wasted exposition.  He explores vast concepts of Truth and Religion and Goodness versus Evil and all while sending you on a grand adventure.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Omg luv this app it's so great on my kindle. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS APP TO you guys if your looking for a really fun and good game to play.
B0047S1KMS|5.0|This was for my daughter who had seen it on IFC, she told me that it was good so I got it. This was a good British import in the Zombie genre.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app!! Its a great app to play if your bored. And I love how every holiday the setting changes like for Halloween, instead of a police guard chasing you Frankenstein is chasing you and the background is all Halloween decorated. Another  example Christmas, instead of the police guard chasing you Santa is chasing you. And there's Christmas decorations in the background. But the problem is that this game gets really boring afterwards. But I highly recommend this game to you I  your bored of temple run.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Purchased the PC version and hated it because I didn't know how to play.<br />Decided to buy the mobile version because it was on sale, and I was amazed at how simple it was to play after I utilized the tutorial.<br />Due to the limitations of the mobile device I went back to the PC version.<br />Highly recommend this version though. Great for long periods of wait.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really love The Hunger Games series. I think Mockingjay was a great ending to for it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action, adventure, suspense and even romance. Suzanne Collins is one of my favorite authors.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The game is a lot of, albeit repetitive, fun! You know what is not fun? Being asked to review the game every half hour (or less) of play!
B000SGRONM|1.0|I've heard Sedaris  and had favorable impression of him. I wish I'd not read this book. Apparently 65% think he's clever ; cute as a button ; a subtle, sarcastic  genius; and the like . I found him twisted, depressing and dull. The elf story  is too cute by half. The Vietnamese girl in the family story is funny if you think Sedaris' instruction to   &#34;watch &#34; the baby can be interpreted in some alternate reality as &#34;wash &#34; the baby in a laundry machine until dead. It's a sick joke on a third grade level. Fact? Fiction ? Who knows or cares. New Yorker refuses to label his work nonfiction because it can't be fact checked. A wierd Christmas downer of a book.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Lots of action, surprises keep popping up all the way to end. I kept going back to the book whenever I could.
0767919408|4.0|Bryson is a wonderful writer and 1927 was a wonderful summer.  But Bryson is not always a wonderful researcher.  I say this only to note that his conclusions on Sacco and Vanzetti are simplistic.  It is NOT the consensus of historians that the pair were guilty of the robbery for which they were execute.  In fact, there is no consensus other than that they clearly deserved a second trial and that the execution was a grave injustice.  We will never know whether they were guilty but to cite Francis Russell (guilty!) as your major source and then lean towards guilt is to ignore the vast amount of scholarshi and evidence to the contrary.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read this book for my daughter and she was right, it's amazing! Thank you for an awesome way to remember my daughter!
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|The acting is incredible!  Walt is a unique character and well played.  The support actors are equally memorable.  Love the story
B00FHB7398|5.0|AWESOME. NO GLITCHES. EASY BACK AN  FORTH. GREAT GRAPHICS. THANK YOU BIG FISH FOR ADAPTING TO ANDROID SERVICES! CAN'T WAIT TO TRY MORE OF THEM.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun way to spend some time.  Glad I could get on kindle.  Was looking for since had on prior device. Try and you will enjoy.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|i downloaded it on the kindle appstore and got very addicted to it.I tryed to play it the next day but it froze my kindle.this game is ok but glitches a lot.
B00G3P6VA4|4.0|5 stars for the sociopolitical message, stunning visuals and fast paced action. Only drawback was that the dialog was hard to make out in spots - especially mad Kreuger's thickly accented grumblings. Will watch this several more times - not something I normally do.
B003ZJ70W4|2.0|the first movie felt more genuine and had truer characterization.  the 2nd movie felt forced and floundering.  i did like the questions about having one's best marriage, though.  sometimes, you really do need a break.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was even better than the first! I love how Prim developed maturely. I also like how Katniss and Peeta became genuinely attracted to each other. I would recommend everyone read this book since anyone can relate in some way to Katnniss's experiences.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|This is my favorite album they ever released. &#34;First Impressions of Earth&#34; is a departure from their first two albums, but still retains their classic charm. They have a variety of styles on this album to make it their most unique.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A fun game that has plenty of various challenges that keeps the game play fresh and exciting!<br />Let your inner minion out!
B00000JCB2|5.0|Even though the music is not what you would call &#34;good,&#34; it's a great nostalgic album for all those who grew up in the late '90s. Singles like &#34;Nookie&#34; and &#34;Break Stuff&#34; can bring a child of this era right back in time.
B00GQ7PILC|1.0|Seriously, unless you are so rabid a fan that it wouldn't bother you in the least if the writers were to have ended the series by having Dexter retire and open a Yarn Barn in upstate New York, save your money on this last season. Because it is THAT bad and will only p*ss you off that you wasted it.<br /><br />My wife and I were very big fans of the show and were excited to see the final season available, so we binged on it over the course of 2 days. The dialogue was forced and stunted, the acting was bad, plot depth was all but non-existent, there were a couple dead end sub-plots added that were nothing more than time fillers, etc. I am all but certain they essentially off-the-cuffed this whole season and could not have cared less about rendering a memorable ending to an otherwise superbly creative and out-of-the-ordinary series.<br /><br />No exaggeration: the worst last season and final episode to a television series I've ever seen. That the words 'brilliant' and 'satisfying' have been applied to the final season and conclusion of this series boggles the mind.<br /><br />All this said, I do understand that there's no accounting for taste. So, if you thought the ending to 'Breaking Bad' was really good, the ending to 'Lost' made you wish you'd never started watching the show, the ending to 'The Sopranos' was so-so, and no show will ever end as well as did 'Seinfeld' or 'Cheers,' you'll likely want to heed my warning about purchasing this last season of Dexter, and wait for it to be available for free (Netflix, etc).<br /><br />UPDATE: 1/4/14: For anyone that has Netflix, I noticed last night that the final season is now available.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|For those who were turned away by the change in AFI's sound over the last five years or so, this album will draw you back. And even those like myself who liked the change can love the darkness and power of this album. These songs are a complete departure from the happier themes of &#34;Crash Love.&#34; This is already one of my favorite albums by my favorite band. Songs like &#34;I Hope You Suffer&#34; and &#34;Face Beneath the Waves&#34; have the dark power that some AFI fans have missed. Others like &#34;17 Crimes&#34; and &#34;Heart Stops&#34; provide a nice variety to make this album complete.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its the best game.high score is 199333.I play it everyday.love it it is awesome.yeah.awesome cool amazing game.
B004EHZPEG|4.0|I don't recommend this particular edition, though. Layout is atrocious and there's even some uncorrected typos. Amazon or the publisher clearly didn't do too good of a job.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is awesome, play this game and you'll find out why. I have this on ps3 ( btw, I'm looking for people who play terraria on ps3, if you do, add me, oWiseGuyo) but back to the point,  it has accessories, these are really helpful, bosses dungeons legendary items found in chests and even more!<br />Try it, you will love it.
0307719774|5.0|the quality of this book is super great, it is super cute. The questions aren't always the greatest, but most are fun!<br /><br />The book is a great decor piece too actually. I even saw these for sale and Anthro!
0307454541|5.0|I read the whole trilogy and enjoyed all the action and excitement as well as the high technology theme and the interpersonal relationship between the girl and the writer.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great story and a good read. Had to put down . Wanted to see what Ender would do next. Special
1452117160|5.0|As someone who loves \\"the art of\\" books, this one is no exception. I absolutely loved the movie but also the art style. The animation gets better year after year and its really cool to see how it came to be. This book shows concept art, has notes from the directors and animators on why they made certain choices, and essentially all the drawing and sketches that made the movie what it is today. Like I said, I have many other \\"the art of\\" books, and I am very pleased to add this one to my collection.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|This is a stunning tale of the culture of a Google-like tech company that is dedicated to doing good but maybe is not doing well.  The author tells a tale that is both gripping and thought provoiking
B00EJB44VW|5.0|Thought provoking book that challenges what we have been taught about this cultural icon. Changes the way I think about Jesus.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This games has a lot of cool stuff and its extremely fun to play. I do wish that the goods ship came back faster but other than that it's great
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Well made there design is good and has plenty of levels to challenge yourself with. The idea is good and the fact that it is free makes it better
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is so addictive especially all of the upgrades in the game if you don't have the app yet GET IT!!!!!!!!
B00EUUJID6|5.0|The music is absolutely fabulous - out of this world!  I've already ordered three CD's and am already down to one.  Everyone I've played it for has wanted a copy so I've given all my extras away and will have to order some more.  I'm not usually into Xmas but this CD does make the Christmas spirit real.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm glad I had this book to read on an international flight. It grabbed my attention, and before I knew it, I was 2/3 done with the book and at my destination. The characters are well developed, flawed but likeable, and the dystopic story is original and compelling. I look forward to reading the next part of it, the Shift omnibus.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|This is a really good game but can not justify paying that much for it. This company has a lot of really great games at reasonable prices but will not pay this amount if it goes down in price I will buy it.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Saw this in the theater, and it was such a great true story I wanted to view the film again.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is a good game it looks really realistic and it is fun to play so if I were you I would get this game
B001AW156U|5.0|After using it once my mind was made up, I wont use a ps3 controller without these. Perfect upgrade. Good quality.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game looks fabulous, plays great, and even the music - which I usually turn off - is pleasant. I like to just play all the levels without paying too much attention to the number of moves. Then I go back and aim at getting the minimum number of moves.<br /><br />When I quit the game and later played again, all my gold frames were gone, and the checkmarks had reverted back to silver in lieu of gold. Strangely, the game remembered that my previous score was perfect, and the coins earned for perfect score remained. This happened twice. This of course means I have to manually keep track of which stages/levels I want to replay to improve my score.<br /><br />One star deduction for this glitch.
B00F35BV64|1.0|Just say no.  Awful film, may ruin the greatness of the first remake for you.  What happened? Just say no.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When i got this game i thought it was gonna be like temple run or subway surfers but its not it's way better than both.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is t he beeeeeeeeeeessst book in the history of mankind designed for the use of me and you boom

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Transforms a normal TV in a Smart TV<br />Works excellent with YouTube, Netflix and Chrome.<br />Works excellent without mayor configuration with Smartphone, tablet and Notebook.

B003G8Y4QO|5.0|you never think that you can ever forget the old doctor, but they do a great job in the series to keep you interested and entertained.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just love it!A very awesome game to play.Also a kid friendly game.I would recommend it to everyone.  Good and up:)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome<br />Couldn't be any better<br />If u count the intensity the romance the pride the n your result is this book
B005T87QCI|3.0|The controls moves on its own sometimes/most of the Times and that's all three stars is good.<br />Please fix or update if you need to
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|It was a very stereotyped knock off of Sherlock Holmes-like stories. It was very politically correct with a female asian Dr Watson who has to be a modern day anti-hero. She couldn't just be a doctor. She had to be a doctor who has failed due to contemporary pitfalls like malpractice.
B004UPANAI|2.0|This is a terrible movie. Wolverine busts out of a tank of water where he basically died a few minutes ago, then in the next scene his hair is perfectly coiffed and blow-dryed. That's the kind of storytelling and movimaking care in evidence through most of the film. Characters pop up then disappear, no one has any emotional depth outside of Wolverine and Sabretooth and even this is given short shrift in favor of annoying cameos by Deadpool and Gambit. Then nothing solid is done with either so they are there... why?<br /><br />Stunts are \\"Oh, this' ll be cool\\" rather than flowing from the story, the kid playing young Wolverine is not fantastic. And the one part of the film where something new with emotional depth occurs (Wolverine's retreat into the Canadian wilderness with a beautiful, seemingly caring woman, from what little we see of her) is rushed over in order to get to some more cliché \\"superhero movie\\" writing (i.e. think the derivative Daredevil, not Dark Knight), etc.<br /><br />I give this 2 stars because Hugh Jackman is awesome, as always, as is Liev Schrieber as Sabretooth. So much potential here for a great film, almost all completely wasted. What a shame. Fortunately, this movie is so bad the studio was forced to make The Wolverine very true to the source material and handed us a great film. Buy that one! Buy this if you can get it for $3 as I did.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy candy crush for the most part, even though I struggle with the levels. It's nice that I can play from face book or my Kindle and not have to worry about repeating levels.
B00BATG18K|4.0|I am only 42% into the book, it's a good read, but is very flowery and spends a lot of time analyzing the feelings of the main character.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Pot-boiler.  Has something to do with guns and Brad Pitt doing something.  It's been a week and I really can't remember.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Do we not live in the Circle now? Do we not routinely sacrifice privacy for convenience, security, self-esteem, validation, paranoia, worry, pleasure, and every other seemingly logical motive? What would the fulfilling of that desire seem to be at the beginning?<br /><br />It would look like now.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|There are plenty of great reviews of this fantastic Blu-ray music video. You don't need me to tell you Led Zep Rules!
B0062OCNAI|1.0|I too believed the reviews on this book and was sadly disappointed.  The storyline is depressing and tugs at all the wrong heartstrings.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|A friend recommended this flick. I bought it , played it, then played it again. I group it with 'reality within a reality' flicks like the Matrix series and &#34;The Thirteenth Floor&#34;. Haunting, get it and see if you like it.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|A very powerful movie and great acting the plane sequence was very well done and the endind was perfect thanks
0316055433|5.0|I am convinced that Donna Tartt, the beguiling, brilliant, and reclusive Southern novelist writes a novel every ten years so people can say: this is the best book I've read in ten years. Each of her novels are startlingly different in tone, subject matter, setting, and characterization, yet all of them are delicately composed, stunningly structured, and beautifully written. Her cult following is both assured and deserved. Her first two novels make my personal Top 100 list, and in my humble opinion, The Goldfinch is her finest work.<br /><br />I'm going to avoid the pretentious genre marker that other reviewers seem to be using on here with reckless abandon (hint: it sounds like an outdated font) and simply classify this novel as a present-day coming-of-age story. 13-year-old Theo Dekker loses his mother in a terrorist attack at the Met. In the hazy, horrific aftermath Theo commits art theft (referencing the painting of the novel's title, currently on display at The Frick, here in NYC, along with some other Dutch painters) and the book begins to explore its central themes of love, loss, redemption, and how no one truly survives a tragedy without having at least a part of them die in it.<br /><br />But the book goes deeper than that. It tests the bounds of friendship, how much of our familial flaws are entrapped within our DNA, snaring and empowering us, and the power and beauty of art: how it seduces and destroys us. \\"Dickensian\\" is an apt description of the novel, and fitting since Tartt was wholly influenced by Dickens (there is a lawyer named \\"Bracegirdle\\"), but I believe those who do not like Dickens will still enjoy this novel. Like Dickens, the engine of the story is in the fascinating and varied characters that Tartt creates (even the minor ones) as Theo, a sudden orphan, lost and alone, gets shuffled around as grief, terror, and tragedy loom up around him, blinding his conscience as well as his future.<br /><br />The conflict builds through characterization,and the action of the book spirals out of the souls of each of these frighteningly vivid and multi-layered people, most of them haunted and lost (to a degree) themselves.<br /><br />The frosty, fusty, slightly campy world of Park Avenue and the Barbours (in one of the novel's funniest and most chilling sections) gives way to the phony glare and gleam of the Las Vegas desert (in the novel's most effective section) as Theo is reconnected with his deadbeat actor dad and his dad's dopey, sleazy girlfriend, Xandra. We begin to understand, in the world of The Goldfinch, how some people wear their wounds as scars, while others swallow them like benzos. Everyone is broken, it's all in degrees.<br /><br />Theo befriends Boris, a drugged-out, alcoholic, abused, ambisexual Russian boy, who teaches Theo all the wrong ways to both soothe and manipulate pain. He's a millennial Artful Dodger. Their friendship is the heart of the book, even if that's not what Tartt intended. Boris is an ingenious accomplishment, one of the strongest aspects of the book, and certainly one Dickens would have raised a shot glass of vodka for.<br /><br />It's only because the first chunk of a fairly long novel is so strong, so deeply felt, that the second half lags (a tad) as Theo grows up under the tutelage of an overly kind antiques dealer in Greenwich Village named Hobie, and falls in love with Hobie's dead business partner's daughter (the man also died in the blast, stringing fate together like a runaway kite). Here, Theo falls back into the clutches of the Barbours as he comes to terms with the demons of the past (the stolen painting) and the demons of the present (his addictions) as he tries to carve out some semblance of a livable future for himself.<br /><br />The climax is set in Amsterdam and the events resemble the last fifteen minutes of a Guy Ritchie film.<br /><br />Some may say Tartt ran out of ideas, and the novel devolves into unbelievable circumstances and stream-of-consciousness rumination, but I loved this book so much, I think it all fits together perfectly, and I began to appreciate the book's flaws just as much as its strengths. This is, without question, a five-star novel and a book that deserves to be read and studied alongside other edgy coming-of-age classics like The Catcher In The Rye, Huck Finn, Oliver Twist, and Lord of the Flies.<br /><br />On a side note, David Gilbert's recent, under appreciated novel [[ASIN:0812993969 And Sons: A Novel]] works as a fantastic rejoinder to this one, like a troubled step sibling. It covers familiar territory in a very different way, but ultimately can't touch Tartt. No other recent novel, even recent ones I liked very much (Marisha Pessl's Nightfilm, for instance) can touch The Goldfinch.<br /><br />It is interesting to me that the best writers I've read of late (Tartt, Lorrie Moore, Gillian Flynn, Sarah Waters, Roxana Robinson) and the worst (Karen Russell, Monica Ali) all happen to be women. The men (Updike, Roth, Fitzgerald, Hemingway) who once dominated the game are sliding into the middle-of-the-road like they're afraid to take the same risks. Good for Tartt, et al. And good for the South, which continues to produce this country's most gloried writers like some kind of magic kingdom. What's going on down there?<br /><br />I couldn't stop thinking about The Goldfinch while I was reading it, and I can't stop thinking about it now. I've become Theo, seeing beauty and madness in a single work of art.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is completely filled with some expected and some not so expected turns.  Very infusing. A definite must read.
0761172726|5.0|I just bought this today.  I LOVE Sandra Boynton's Mom's Family Calendars and have bought one every year since 2004.  They're very practical and perfect for a busy Mom or Dad.  There's a column for each member of the family to track everyone's events, and pages of stickers like Dentist, Sleepover, Library, Doctor, Game, Company, No School, Birthday, etc to label different events - my daughter is 14 and still loves putting the stickers on the calendar.  It also comes with a magnetized card &#34;Mom's Family Phone List&#34; for doctors, neighbors, parents' work, maintenance, etc phone numbers - a great reference for Mom/Dad, kids home alone, or babysitters.  I absolutely love everything about his calendar - for the past 10 years, I have never looked for another calendar.  Thank you Sandra Boynton!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Gave it one star because there was no 0 star choice. Look, this evening had an aggravating portion because Google is not an honest company. Period. In addition to being purveyors and supporters of child pornography ... until, um, last week ... due to their support  .... I digress.<br /><br />The Chromecast was purchased for me as a gift. The buyer bought it based on the FALSE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN -- that shows easy, 'one click' from tablet/computer to TV screen.<br /><br />Problem -- there is no Chrome browser 'tab' to 'cast' from -- the extension is &#34;not supported at this time&#34; as per ... Google. So you can play Netflix, sure. Youtube. Whee! But the buyers that are sold an expectation that they can see their screen on a TV are sadly ripped off.<br /><br />Soo... luckily this useless P.O.S. was purchased from Best Buy so it can be returned with a little, er, urging at the customer service desk. Nothing new there either. And anyone with an HDMI out on a notebook can watch ANYTHING from their browser on TV without this limited little gadget. So bye, and really, be warned before parting with any more $$ to Google anything -- did I mention my company's early experience with Google advertising ... aka vacuuming our money away on false clicks ...?
B006GLSO7I|3.0|Season 1 is not the best of all the seasons, but it was the start of what was the most epic series for women.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I got it on the free for the day. that's why I rate it 5. but don't get it another day.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|Hambo is a simple physics game, similar to Tennis in the Face but this time with bullets.  Basically you're a pig serial killer, aiming to kill a few army pigmen each round (well you need to kill all of them).  You do this by either shooting the other pigs, or destroying a glass platform they are hiding on resulting in them plummeting down off the screen and I assume to their death.  In the initial rounds you are armed with a pistol and as you progress further, a machine gun, and then on some levels both.  Later you get a bow and arrow that explodes on impact, later still grenades, after that C4 which you can explode when you want. You do need to do some thinking but really none of the levels I've encountered so far are that much of a challenge.  Basically you have to work out where the army pigmen will fall, as a result of your shooting so that they are still able to be shot by you would be the most difficult factor.  Sometimes you've got to time it right so you also shoot them plummeting in the air, (sometimes you have to quickly switch weapons mid victim fall). At other times you need to wait so they knock you off the platform you're on, as your character cannot move on its own.  If you make a mistake, die (you can shoot yourself by ricocheting bullets) or run out of bullets you can simply replay each level.  Although you are unlikely to need it, there is a view solution button on each round as well.  I pressed it on one just to see what will happen since it is free, and basically it is like a watching a video of someone else controlling the pig and shooting in all the right places and at the right time.  It is free to cheat if you want by doing this, but honestly none of the levels are hard enough to need to.  There is actually a limited number of times your allowed to cheat by either viewing the solution or skipping a challenge, the game of course makes its money from you by letting you purchase more opportunities, as well as coins to make costume changes.<br /><br />At one of the levels in the early 20s you will have obtained enough coins (which you get by completing each level) and be offered to change costumes.  There's actually a fair few of these, although Rambo is probably one of the best ones anyway, you can choose from being Hambocop, a Cartman from Southpark type pig called South Pork, Swine Reaper, Spider Pig (not the one from The Simpsons),  Adham (no costume), Just a Beaver (tryhard pop star), Boris (Borat parody), Hamo (Goth), a wizard pig, Hamrisson Pork (Junior from Indiana Jones parody), Sir Spam-a-lot (Knight), Hog of War, Pig in Black, Hampache (Native American Pig), Imotham (Mummy), Wild Hog (missing link pig), Pork Ranger (Mighty Morphan Power Rangers parody), Santa, Roman Soldier pig, Star Pork (Trekkie parody), ExtraHam-inator (Terminator parody), viking pig, zombie pig, Money Pig (Angry Big parody), Asian ancient warrior, Hog Norris (Chuck parody), pirate pig, pixel pig, Starlett Jo Hamsson (Scarlett parody), and a few that are dressing up as characters from the developers other game apps.  In the Robocop costume the pig acts and can do the same things it could as Rambo, and all the other pigs are still army men.  I assume this would be the case with the other costumes.<br /><br />The music is simple but catchy, sort of 80's movie soundtrack score style and sound effects.  The graphics are simple but colourful and fun.  When a pig gets killed it turns into a can of Spam, if you shoot yourself you turn into a grave so it's pretty child friendly.  You can also die if you land on a stray stationary or rolling bullet, so don't get too trigger happy. You also only have a set number of bullets. It is really not that difficult so kids would have no problems playing it.  Hambo works in airplane mode so you don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play it (and so kids can't accidentally or on purpose make those in app purchases).><br />At one of the levels in the early 20s you will have obtained enough coins (which you get by completing each level) and be offered to change costumes.  There's actually a fair few of these, although Rambo is probably one of the best ones anyway, you can choose from being Hambocop, a Cartman from Southpark type pig called South Pork, Swine Reaper, Spider Pig (not the one from The Simpsons),  Adham (no costume), Just a Beaver (tryhard pop star), Boris (Borat parody), Hamo (Goth), a wizard pig, Hamrisson Pork (Junior from Indiana Jones parody), Sir Spam-a-lot (Knight), Hog of War, Pig in Black, Hampache (Native American Pig), Imotham (Mummy), Wild Hog (missing link pig), Pork Ranger (Mighty Morphan Power Rangers parody), Santa, Roman Soldier pig, Star Pork (Trekkie parody), ExtraHam-inator (Terminator parody), viking pig, zombie pig, Money Pig (Angry Big parody), Asian ancient warrior, Hog Norris (Chuck parody), pirate pig, pixel pig, Starlett Jo Hamsson (Scarlett parody), and a few that are dressing up as characters from the developers other game apps.  In the Robocop costume the pig acts and can do the same things it could as Rambo, and all the other pigs are still army men.  I assume this would be the case with the other costumes.<br /><br />The music is simple but catchy, sort of 80's movie soundtrack score style and sound effects.  The graphics are simple but colourful and fun.  When a pig gets killed it turns into a can of Spam, if you shoot yourself you turn into a grave so it's pretty child friendly.  You can also die if you land on a stray stationary or rolling bullet, so don't get too trigger happy. You also only have a set number of bullets.

B001I45UFC|5.0|I loved the book.  It was just like the movie.  I really want to read the rest of the series.  My 10 year-old son stayed very interested in the book all the way to the end.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I really wanted to like it, but it didn't deliver.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Cheap(er)<br />- Easy to pair<br /><br />CONS<br />- Wireless network speed too low, always pausing and buffering (my other devices just streams fine)<br />- Chrome browsing lags big time<br />- Disconnects very often (almost everytime)
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|A great game with amazing graphics. It didn't take long to get addicted. I love how it tells you that your crops are ready
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is the best game I ever played!! I cant stop playing it!!<br /><br />Its the best game in the world,and if you dont have it you need to get it its AMAZING,AWESOME,AND GREAT!!! I love it!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second time I read this so I could refresh my memory before I see the movie. It is a totally awesome book. Can't wait to read the third one. Highly recommended trilogy.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|when I went on this game I was so siprised I thought I would be so stupid but its not its awesome
B00957T6X6|5.0|Fall in love with a character and live with the consequences - fate has no favorites and life's not fair.  Love the brutal honesty and can't wait for the next book.
B0036WHM1E|5.0|Very interesting music. I had to listen to it a few times but now I'm a big fan.  The sound quality is excellent (except for track 5 which has a bit of background noise) with good bottom end and very clear vocals, guitars and string instruments.  I'll be looking for more of their music.
B00004Z4SD|4.0|Heartwarming, good family fun !!  We really liked it.  They say it was a true story ... just wish it would  of told more of how he got home from his long trip.
B000002KK2|4.0|Nice smooth easy going and enjoyable.  Reviews of here second album say she changed her style and still sounds good so I'll try that next.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Great book hope there is more to come from Alex and aiden. Love the ongoing adventure and can't wait to read another jennifer armentrout series
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is another great book from John Grisham.  If you like his other legal books, this is not one you should miss.
0756656230|5.0|Was buying for Christmas present for my Grandchildren and loved all the information about Lego. Know they will love this book
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|The book is good, but could have benefited from some truly disruptive thinking about what is possible... The innovations described are very near term... Perhaps this is part of the power of the book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is loads of fun and can be very challenging at times....it doesn't matter because you keep going back for more....can I say partially addictive....love it...:-)
B00ESY77LO|2.0|We thought this was overproduced with marginal acting and a bizarre soundtrack.  Read the book instead, or watch an earlier adaptation.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Addicting.  I love it.  Just wish the update kept records of time like the original app did.  Play it till my battery dies every day.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|The Breaking Bad blu-ray box set is the pride and joy of my collection! It is every bit as beautiful as advertised, and comes with such a wide range of bonus material and special features that if you were to put them in their own set, they would likely be worth as much as the series itself. That is no exaggeration! The set comes with a two hour documentary about the making of the final season which is practically a feature film in and of itself. Not only that but every disc from the individual seasons comes packed with deleted scenes, commentaries, and featurettes relevant to that season. The commentaries themselves were endlessly entertaining, and the banter between the actors and production staff just serves to show how much love and care went into the making of this series!<br /><br />The set itself is gorgeous, coming in a study barrel just like the ones used to store money and dissolve dead bodies (morbid, I know, but the fact is that the barrel is iconic for the show). The blu-rays are stowed compactly inside, accessible by a door in the side. Though confusing at first, you can soon tell that the discs are held between plexiglass plates that are fixed together with tiny magnets. At first I was worried that the magnets would corrupt the data on the blu-rays, but I have yet to notice an issue. The plates themselves are printed with small but iconic images from the season they contain, and when you take one or more discs or of the case, these images fit together like pieces of a puzzle. Touches like this really distinguish this set from your average television show!<br /><br />When I inspected further, I noticed that the top of the barrel comes off, which was how I found the documentary previously mentioned. The disc is plainly marked by the GPS coordinates where Walt buries his money in the final season, and was hidden in the cap of the barrel, so finding it made me feel like I had stumbled across some great secret that I was never meant to find. Inside the barrel itself was the Los Polls Hermanos apron that I was so excited about when I bought the set. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it) the apron was so beautifully wrapped that I didn't want to open it. I felt less bad about taking out the collectors coin that comes with it.<br /><br />In summary, every little thing about the set from the packaging to the special features to the collectors items inside are inherently Breaking Bad. Every moment from the time you first open that little black barrel to the title menu screen with its twangy Breaking Bad theme song gets you pumped up to watch the series all over again from start to finish. Every disc has something new and special to offer that putting in the next one is almost like unwrapping another small gift from Vince Gilligan, and everyone else involved in this fantastic series!
B008D28HYS|4.0|When I first started this I absolutely loved it!  But now am stuck on a puzzle that I can't seem to solve.  Wish I could just skip it and do another one.
B008I34XUY|5.0|I ordered this for my husband for his Birthday. He has it in Vinyl but wanted it on CD so he could listen to it in his vehicle on road trips.
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|Just not my kind of game I guess.  For those who are into this type I believe they would probably really enjoy it.
B008B37C8Q|5.0|I ordered this for my husband for his Birthday. He has it in Vinyl but wanted it on CD so he could listen to it in his vehicle on road trips.
B005ZMTXMY|4.0|This movie has a great plot, and a powerful, witty, somewhat emotional perspective. You could get it at a movie store for cheaper than Amazon Instant Video.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|This is a Christmas for our 4 yr. old grandson who is a Batman nut!  He loves anything and everything Batman related.
B000W9EOEC|4.0|Alive 2007 is Daft Punk's live masterpiece. I truly believe that. Be warned though... this CD doesn't include the encore track 13.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Stop selling me out!!! Why do you keep changing your privacy policy, I can't keep up, I know you need to sell my info, but please slow down
B00FEN1C50|4.0|There's a copy of the last bonus feature - it appears twice. They should've fixed that before distributing it. Other than that, it was awesome. The movie has a good plot and it's well done.
1476729085|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It's a fast read, fun, sweet and romantic.<br /><br />This is the story of geneticist Don Tillman, who has resigned himself to a life without a mate because, as others have told him time and again, he is too weird to find a wife. It might have something to do with his literal-mindedness or the fact that he eats the same seven meals every week or that he doesn't understand sarcasm. At any rate, he seems to repel women.<br /><br />Don decides to take one more shot at it by creating the Wife Questionnaire. He sets up a series of questions meant to eliminate women who are incompatible with him. But, his best friend (actually, one of his only two friends) sends over a girl named Rosie who ostensibly took the test (she didn't). When Don meets her, he finds he is enraptured by Rosie, so much that when she confesses that she would like to find her real father, he jumps in and volunteers to help.<br /><br />As they begin working on the Father project, Don realizes clearly that Rosie is not a good candidate for a wife...but he can't stop thinking about her and even concocts excuses to see her.<br /><br />But, are his feelings permanent? Can Rosie be in a lasting relationship with him? Don realizes he has changes to make if he will be able to win the incompatible woman of his dreams and he sets out to make them.<br /><br />There are a few specific reasons why, to me, this is not a five-star book. First, although Don Tillman is an interesting and quirky character, his weird behaviors grow weary after a while. In addition, the plot is a bit thin and predictable. But, despite these deficiencies, the book is engaging and fun to read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is an ok game I think the prices are outrageous I mean who earns all those coins anyway the compositions are so boring why can't we win a horse as our prize because the horse's are like 2000 coins the land is 6000000 I mean this game needs to lower their prices before nobody plays their game anymore !!!
B00594XOZU|1.0|I am disappointed because kik is currently unavailable on the Amazon Appstore ... but I don't understand why because my friend has it on her ipod touch and its available on her apple Appstore.<br />But when this app is available I love it! When this app is available I give it 5 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game running through obstacles and objects making the game amazing:)<br />It is amazing who wouldn't love it the minions are so cute Iove the clothes that they can wear I love that you can get bananas to level up
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Gave up on Grisham a few years ago but saw the racketeer hanging around the best seller list for awhile and took a shot. I read it in a day on the long Thanksgiving day weekend and have to admit, it was enjoyable and made the non working day pass quickly.<br />  The plot is a little far fetched but it's a great screenplay that begs to be made. Now that I read it I will read Sycamore Row. Nice job. Perfect for the beach , pool or in front of the fireplace!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I am enjoying trying to beat myself time and time again. I am getting a little annoyed that it is taking a while to get there. Overall fun game.
B00457WZEI|5.0|It is a great story with turns and twisted that keep you reading, with the correct ending. ENJOY the travel I did.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I love ANIMALS and this is great for someone who loves mincraft or animals u should get it but they need more time to play:)
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This was by far and away, the best non fiction book I have ever read!  How is it that a lot of this stuff wasn't published before?
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|It is a great book. I couldn't stop reading it because it was so amazing. You will definitely love it.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|absolutely amazed that this is free. great for advanced learners to test out of lower levels, get to the good stuff and brush up on grammar and vocabulary. syncs w app on my phone for seamless use.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I loved the back to the basics feel, loved the history part about James, sad over the ending. I am a big fan of Javair- Talk about a mommy complex. I would see this movie again.
1476729085|5.0|Graeme Simsion's The Rosie Project, had me rooting for genetics professor Don Tillman, whose life is based on logic and control, as he searches for a life partner with The Wife Project.  Along the way, Don meets Rosie, looking for her biological father, and he puts the Wife Project on the side to help her find her dad (The Father Project).  While Rosie is pretty much the epitome of what Don is not looking for, the reader knows she's perfect for him, breaking Don out of his logic-ridden shell.  Around Rosie, Don finds himself breaking his own rules and discovers moments of pure joy- &#34;Another world, another life, proximate but inaccessible.  The elusive… Sat-is-fac-tion.&#34;  My heart broke for emotionally-crippled Don as he realized the emptiness of his routined life, and it soared for him when he began to slowly alter his over-regimented life.  Filled with thoughtful insights and complete with proven statistics, The Rosie Project taught me a lot about human nature and their ability to love.  I am in love with this unique and quirky book and the realistically vulnerable characters that it brought to life.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|A fun and entertaining movie with a great Hulk character piece at the end of the movie while he is taking care of business. Fun to see more than just grunts and general smashing.
B0031QNDUO|5.0|One of my all time favorites!  A must see every Christmas season!  So happy to have this to watch with just a click of my remote!
B005GO5B2W|5.0|There are no better entertainers and musicians than these two and what a great cause! I loved the CD and it was in perfect condition. Thanks
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like this game. I played castleville on Facebook and enjoyed the game but didn't like that you couldn't do anything without having it all over your wall and filling up the news feed for your friends. So far, this isn't a problem with castleville legends on my kindle Fire.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Sort of a modern-day version of “Charade” (much better than the ACTUAL modern-day remake, “The Truth About Charlie“), “Now You See Me” is a phenomenally entertaining piece of prestidigitation about four street magicians - Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Isla Fischer - who form an act called The Four Horsemen, whose claim to fame is that they have the ability to rob banks without leaving the arena where they’re performing. Like the Stanely Donen classic, “Now You See Me” is built on a series of plot twists and character turns in which no one or nothing is quite what it appears to be.<br /><br />The always engaging Mark Ruffalo is the skeptical FBI agent trying to catch the criminals in the act, while old pros Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman have the time of their professional lives as a veteran magician and a veteran magician debunker, respectively. Their scenes together are alone worth the price of admission. And Ruffalo is perfection as the slightly disheveled and perpetually outmaneuvered law enforcer who finds himself up against a quartet of antagonists who always manage to be a good half-dozen or so steps ahead of him.<br /><br />It’s hard to overstate just how much fun this movie turns out to be, with well-earned kudos going to Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt for their infinitely imaginative screenplay, Louis Leterrier for his turbocharged direction, and all the technical wizards who’ve engaged in a little legerdemain of their own by making the magic scenes so seamless and convincing.<br /><br />And if it all doesn’t seem entirely plausible in the end, and you walk away with the nagging suspicion that the writers must have cheated in some way - well, that IS the power of magic, after all.<br /><br />Hollywood filmmakers please take note: THIS is how you make a crowd-pleasing blockbuster!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I enjoyed the story and really didn't see the ending coming.  I usually know who done it long before the end.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Took me a minute to figure out by how to play (you just tap in the direction you want to move), but after that, smooth gameplay. Much preferred over Room, which I found difficult and not so fun.
0545128285|5.0|I love this book, it is so much fun to read and I love the artwork on the cover! This is a must have for any Harry Potter fan!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Catches you in the beginning and never lets you go.  Great read!  Keep reading to the end to get the true impact of the book.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Love love love Gideon and Eva's relationship very upset that the 4th book isn't out it only took me less than a week to read all 3 books just to be told the 4 and 5 are being delayed wtf you need to get them out asap
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Always wondered about the start of Reacher and why he existed.  First book explained a lot of gaps in my Reacher history.  Loved the new forward.  Great job
B004UO0SAO|5.0|I have always used the reverse polish notation,  thanks HP, It's just the way you logically think about doing math problems.
0767919408|5.0|I think I would like anything Bill Bryson wrote, but this book was superb. Bryson obviously did his homework (check out the notes at the end) and the result is the telling of exactly the title of the book. One Summer. It's wonderful history without having to take the exam. Kudos to Bryson.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I love that this has two usb ports so I can charge two things at the same time. It comes in handy.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|First Time player, but where is the online mode? When I hit join gAme it just loads an  loads and nothing happens...
B007SGM084|3.0|I read the first book and wasn't really anxious to continue reading more of the same but my friends told me it does get better and actually evolves into a good story.  However, $7.49 for the whole set is not at all attractive to me particularly since I've read the first installment. S
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the most heartfelt books I've read in years! Really makes you feel as if you are living the story.
B000HF6XV8|4.0|I am a school teacher.. our children should observe movies such as The Secret Garden.....mostly, parents could discuss the morals, values, and lessons taught in this wonderful movie... the BOOK could either be read before or after the movie... we prefer before.
0307476073|2.0|Well, I had a family member rave about how good this book was and it may be but for now I can't get passed the foul language to even get started good on reading it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so amazing. It's a book that you can't just put down. Anybody can relate to it and if they don't then they weren't paying attention.
B00006AG5N|5.0|i bought this CD for my dad for Christmas last year (hes a huge Elvis fan) and he loved it he never stops listening to it it was great i would definitely buy it again, its a great  Christmas or birthday gift for any age and any Elvis fan.
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|There were occasional funny parts to the movie.  All in all, this is just a re-hash of what we've seen before.  I couldn't wait for the  movie to be finished.
B00G32TD98|3.0|I liked the movie and thought it was scary, not cheesy like other horror movies. The acting was good as well as effects.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a wonderful book if you like stories about friendship and loyalty if you like these kind of books you will LOVE this one:)
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Take it for what it's worth.  A semi-cheesy action film with a lot of shooting and blowing things up.  I found it to be entertaining and worth an hour and 45 minutes.  Also, I'll say I don't think you need to have seen RED to enjoy RED 2, but it would probably help a little (not like there's a whole lot of context, or some extremely deep story here).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Bought this to play with because I love horses and ride. This app has everything you could want you can groom your horse ,go to shows with it, feed it , and play with it and the graphics are great.  LOVE IT!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is so fun ! This app is good for all ages. I LOVE THIS APP ! IT IS AWESOME! !!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't believe that this was on the app store I was so happy when I  saw  candy crush on the app store.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|This was a great game. The puzzles were challenging but possible to achieve lol. The story line was interesting and I like how it ended with having a choice to make.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought Katniss was very brave. She helped peeta, fought to the death but did not die.<br />I love this book
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in at least the last ten years.The writing flows smoothly and there are layers upon layers to plumb in the psyche of the main character. As heavy, as depressing as conditions get at times, there is always a strong desire to read on to see what happens next. The writer obviously knows much about life in North Korea under the Dear Leader. The characters come alive in this fascinating story.
B001GMQE7E|5.0|This cut inspired me so much, I wrote a short essay and submitted it a magazine. It was published by The Sun Magazine in Readers Write and won me a years subscription. I liked the one track so much, I bought the rest of the album.
0151003084|5.0|I love this book but it is not for the faint hearted. Terrible things happen to Edward Gorey's tinies as he gives you an illustrated alphabet which I think is hilarious. Some may be offended but I love Mr Gorey's sense of humor and his witty if somewhat ghoulish work.
B00122ORBI|5.0|I really enjoy Vangelis when I'm writing. This album inspired parts of my book, Painting the Rain. I needed moody music (again discovered on Pandora.) They didn't play it as often as I wanted to hear it. That buy now button had brought me back to Amazon downloads more times than I care to admit. Listen to the preview buttons to see which tracks you like best.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|A brilliant piece about the spirit of individuality and the courage of your convictions! These timeless truths never grow old. Students should have this a required reading, along with Anthem.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is awesome. I have never had such a satisfying game. This rocks and if you're considering getting it you should. It is a great way to kill some time.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Haven't reached the level where they ask u to pay yet. Kinda hard to get used to using the bow (I have large fingers).  Otherwise average and fun game. I will keep using it to kill time.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I could not keep away from it !!!!!!! I loved this tale of romance and tragedy! Prince maxon also sounds really cute!
B007BLCGNU|5.0|When I first heard that Leonardo DiCaprio was playing J. Edgar Hoover I didn't think he was a very good choice.  Don't get me wrong - I think he is a very good actor.  I just didn't think it was a good fit.  Boy was I wrong!!!  History buffs may be disappointed with some of the historical &#34;goofs&#34; in the movie, but keep in mind - this isn't a documentary, it's a movie.  Very entertaining from beginning to end, and a tip of my cap to Leo.  Nicely done!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Really similar to flow free. But I like the colors and the noise it makes. Really easy the first twenty levels.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love the game. Very addictive and fun for children and adults have recommended this game to everyone. Great enjoyable fun
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This sounds really promising. Unless you are like me and the 20,283,000 folks that use Comcast for broadband service, in which case you bought a $35 cord.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|normally good. once it streams I don't think you can pause it, rewind, etc.  It seems to play anything that has video embedded.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book compels me to read more about the history of the writing of the Bible and about the evolution of Christianity. The author says he is Christian, but his book suggests that modern Christianity is largely based upon the beliefs of Paul and upon Paul's teachings. It makes me wonder about the specifics of the author's beliefs. Given his findings about the historical Jesus, does HE believe Jesus of Nazareth was divine?
B008Q08IV4|5.0|a classic movie. has humor, warmth, and lots of love. a simple man who looks at life through simple eyes
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Although I am glad I read some of the other crappy reviews, so I knew what to expect.  I might not have been so generous with my stars, without the prior knowledge.<br />Yes, the changing viewpoints are a bit annoying, sometimes it's hard to know whether Tris is talking or Tobias...but it was still a very fast and engaging read, for me.  And knowing the bad horrible thing really was going to happen (because of a review I read that gave it away without warning and really pissed me off), I was able to appreciate the really excellent things about this book (and maybe I'm not so pissed about the spoiler now--lol).  So Ms. Roth has some great quotes, but there's an absolutely amazing one from this book, which transcends it--I will love this book forever because of it.  This is that quote: &#34;I used to think that when people fell in love, they just landed where they landed, and they had no choice in the matter afterward.  And maybe that's true of beginnings... I fell in love with him.  But I don't just stay in love with him by default, as if there's no one else available to me.  I stay with him because I choose to, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other.  I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.&#34;
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|David has created a compilation of music that harkens back to the early days of Bowie. The words and music require time to absorb, you will need to spend some time with this one, but you will come to appreciate. I suggest finding the lyrics online so you can read them, the insert of the CD is very difficult to read.
B00B00RJJO|5.0|I hadn't bought a Billy Bragg record in twenty years but I ordered this one after listening to the preview samples and I was glad I did.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|This is an awesome EJ album, sounds like a merge of old Elton and his collaboration with Leon Russell. It has become one of my favorite EJ albums. Bernie Taupin lyrics and EJ's music hit home.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is what i really, really needed. It's a good way for me to organize my notes. This is what i would recommend
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|Was a gift for my stepson and he love it. He has others dragonball characters and he love it. Great
B004X6PRO6|4.0|No review must have eighteen words why I do not want to write a review five more words required really why must i
0634049011|4.0|My stepson is learning to play guitar and this book is easy to understand and the price is good and fair
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game I've ever played in my whole entire life best game ever cant stop playing it and I love horses!!!
B002ZG997C|5.0|Denzil was spectacular in this astonishing movie! Awesome cineaphotography and screen casting. It had an astonishing ending and street scenes.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Absolutely one of the best Christmas stories of all time.  Told exactly as it was in 1843.  If your looking to experience Christmas in a whole new meaning, read A Christmas Carol.  It truly will change your heart.
B003YV64OI|4.0|A solid processor for someone who does not do a lot of hard core processing.  Replaced motherboard and this processor for my parents simple needs.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Really enjoy...this is getting played in heavy rotation at my home, on the ipod, etc. I like every song...think I will go play it again...now I want all the previous QOTSA cd's... Thanks to Dave Grohl and Them Crooked Vultures for turning me on to the very talented Josh Homme!!!
0545615402|5.0|My daughter is a Harry Potter nut, so I bought these before she wears the regular books out!  Good buy!
B00E6890RG|5.0|during my long years of being a musician and listening to music (i'm 60+, like classic rock/jazz/fusion/prog rock) i've purchased numerous albums/cd's on faith alone... sometimes i got lucky. sometimes i didn't. amazon recommended i consider The Mountain due to my recent purchases (Steven Wilson/Porcupine Tree/Spock's Beard). i decided to go ahead and give it a try. wow, what a find. great cd. several of the melodies i cannot get out of my head. great vocals and musicianship. i would highly recommend that anyone who likes refined progressive rock should give this cd and group a listen. you won't be disappointed.
B008VLWE5E|4.0|I'm self learning how to draw.  It's very useful indeed for understanding the anatomy and how to draw it.  Gives clear instructions and great illustrations too.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a gem this author has written. The writer so completely captured the pain and stupidity of overt discrimination. Without being preachy, the book makes you realize that we all have some trait or condition that may be viewed as unacceptable and thus become the object of ridicule without warning. So, instead of being judgmental or hateful toward people who seem to be different from you, take the time to get to know them; you might be pleasantly surprised.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Disappointing. This is the result of a writer giving up and not caring. I do not expect flowery endings but this whole book was pointless.<br />Roth was on a path to be in a special league but after this, forget it.<br />Waste of money and time.
B00GDFVTZQ|5.0|Love this game!  My only (small) complaint is that on the map page, I often have trouble with the map zooming in and out instead of opening the level when I tap it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is a great read and adorable as well!! Lots Of LOL moments and I can't wait to get my hands on the second one. A little too gruesome for anyone under the age of 15 IMO but seems to be written for 10 y/o and up.
B0013F1D02|2.0|I love all the actors in this movie. So talented and I really like fairytales so i really really wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately i dont think the story was very good something was lacking i dont know what exactly it just was not grabbing me. Maybe it is for young tweens and children and not for a 30 yr old woman.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Its a very relaxing date friendly movie. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a funny movie and is more concerned with laughing than and a nice story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was so beautiful in every way. I enjoyed the characters so very much. I unexpectedly loved the contemporary romantic feel for literature and poetry. This book makes you ponder life, and it will impact how you view life's toughest mysteries. I also have a new respect, or a positive altered view for those with terminal illnesses. The book had me in tears by the end. I got so caught up in the characters, unknowingly. Yes, it is a definite tearjerker but yet beautiful one. I could not put this book down and I finished it in under 24 hours. Highly recommended. My review cannot do it justice.<br /><br />17 year old female, with a new favorite book
B009LQKHIO|1.0|It's a toss-up which was worse - the poor writing or the complete lack of editing.  There are places in this book where the construction of sentences and paragraphs was so bad that reader could barely understand what the writer was trying to convey.  There is already a noticeable lack of accuracy in our country in respect to writing and speaking English.  The author and whoever published this book has just contributed to furthering this regrettable trend.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|changing the hair and eye color. They also enjoy like the accessories like purses shoes earrings necklaces tights. They think putting cucumbers. on their eyes is silly.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Although this book is a page turner, it is a bizarre story. There is no one in it that you can like.
0062107313|5.0|I think this is her best novel yet; it was so informative and so beautifully written. I have read all of her books,  but I liked this one the best. Her other novels left me very depressed. I have also  read all of her friend's books, whose name escapes me at the moment - Lisa See. I have learned so much from both of these women authors. I lived in San Francisco from 1965-1970. They are both such great authors.I feel privileged to have learned what they both wrote about; I had no idea. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a poetic, beautifully written novel.This is a book that I would read again.
B00BSJ2YVA|4.0|Not quite as heavy as their debut, but it has grown on me more and more over time!  This album has a more 60s feel to it, and showcases the band shedding some of their dependence upon Sabbath-like riffs, and coming more into their own!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This movie is so far out of my realm, maybe I am getting too old but I did not like it.  I am a big fan of Tom Hanks I thought I would try this movie...Wow! too strange for me, I gave up early and thought I had better try again...I did and no, not for me.  I read lots of reviews and so many folks liked it.  I recommend reading lots of more serious and complete reviews...I just wimped out!  Thanks
B003VBNN7C|3.0|This is a fun little chic movie. It not the greatest movie but okay to watch every once in a while.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|my friends got this game and liked it so I got it and love it so get game you'd love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This works excellent on kindle fire. Waited along time for it to be available for the kindle. Its the exact facebook game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addicting!  If I could get more lives sooner,  I'd probably never put Candy Crush Saga down!!!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Super easy so far no challenge at all I'm at level 20, the only reason I'm writing this review is because the pop up asked me to. Also, got it free of not I would give it 3 stars and I'd be not very happy after paying for it
B00DXP7L88|5.0|What can I say!  Dexter is a serial killer that captured my  heart.  The only thing I disliked about this is that it is the last and final season.  I own the entire collection and have watched it over and over
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|This is the most important app on my Kindle. I am in the early stages of Dementia at age 54, so I must use my thought processes as often as possible. Game of Words helps me to do just that every day!
B000VWYNNW|5.0|Every bit as good as I remember it! If you were ever a fan of Zeppelin, this is the &#34;must have&#34; album.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book captures you. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the next book, but I don't want them to end
B005L38QHA|4.0|Had this mouse for over 6 months, good so far. Its drivers functioned fine before and after Win 7 reformats and been able to successfully reinstall to working settings (with the enhanced macro functionality). Size-wise this mouse is indeed wider than most mice but that's why I bought it - if you don't want a mouse like that I recommend you research the size of a product before purchasing it if a product of smaller or larger than average size would greatly offend you. Just looking at a picture of the thing should either clue you in to the fact that either the mouse itself is going to be pretty wide or the mouse buttons are going to be pretty small to accommodate such scaling. If you have problems with the side of your hand cramping like I did a wider mouse like this might help you - since I've bought this mouse all problems I've had with that have gone away entirely.<br /><br />I took off a star because I felt like the LED color options were poor and didn't display clearly. That's also beside the fact that the design of the mouse itself is actually colored orange/yellow in parts to give the body of the mouse the appearance it has, and looks pretty terrible with anything other than red/yellow/orange - it isn't clear or see through on the body at all. Only the center circle changes color. That's a picky aesthetic thing though, that most people wouldn't care much about to be honest - functionally the mouse has done everything as advertised.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read, well written for any sailor, soldier or even Marin  to follow.  Civilians can easily keep pace because the military jargon is minimal.
B00EEDNA4M|2.0|I absolutely love this show. I've already watched it start to finish twice, and could go for  third. I dont usually partake in box sets or collectors editions, but this was one I felt like owning. Unfortunately my barrel came in broken. not smashed, but the door comes all the way off due to the hinges being broken clean off, as well as the plastic tube in showed up in being broken in a few pieces. VERY disappointing. I feel like with the price tag put on this, it should have a little more strength and definitely more padding for shipment.  It still holds shut, but must be opened very carefully.
0061684384|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for a friend and she loves it.  It was a nice hard cover copy and it had lovely photos inside.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm So ADDICTED To This GAME I Love That U Can Join Servers With External Also When Will 0.8.0 Come Out
B003F3NDP8|5.0|My daughter and I are big fans of the show, we have the entire collection, I bought this to complete our set.  Always great entertainment!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this game. Me of course keeps running into things. All in all its a pretty good game!!!
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|I bought all the Desperate Housewives dvds for my daughter because its her favorite show.  She watches it all the time.  Had a great price and it added to our collection nicely.
B00336C3EY|5.0|The dialogue is wonderful, the characters flawed but lovable.<br /><br />It is inspiring to be totally entertained without exploding cars or hybrid heroes.
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|PDK is an uncanny writer.  This book has perhaps the best description of what it is like to die ever written.  It is also one of the best satires of the consumerist society ever penned.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great game love the graphics on this game the animals look real an it keeps u on your toes whole playing
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Like the new update with the best costumes and awesomest  New levels . Great for kids ,cause I'm a kid
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Cinematography and special effects are good.<br />Plot is fairly predictable - subplots are few and they are not explored to any depth<br />If you are a fan of Denzel Washington's acting then you may enjoy his performance
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game. I am really enjoying it. Graphics are good it's not hard to play. Best of all, it's free... I will be playing this for a while..yup yup.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Super game. First time playing and already addicted! However . . .I don't appreciate being timed out and pushed to pay for power ups.
B006S01GH2|5.0|This is a lovely, whimsical tale of a girl looking for a friend and ending with love.  A wonderful cast of characters for anyone who's been alone for a while.
B005FPT51K|3.0|decent baby monitor, but definitely has some issues.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. easy set up<br />2. great connectivity over WIFI, never had an issue<br />3. Pan and Tilt work great<br />4. Audio is clear and loud... only a 2 sec. delay for me<br />5. decent resolution, zoom get blurry but thats expected<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. The app is horrible... some functions don't work at all<br />2. Snap a picture does not work, at all.<br />3. Notifications don't work well, too sensitive even with adjustments<br />4. Night vision is washed out with over contrast even when adjusted<br />5. Doesn't work on Android devices, even though they are &#34;working on it&#34;<br /><br />I am going to try to get a different baby monitor, this was the first one I bought and it does some things well but not enough to justify keeping it or recommending you buy one.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Had to clear out some space on 2nd gen Fire but runs fine and is very addicting.  Tutorial and in-game info are very helpful.
B00168OIP8|3.0|Review is for condition of the movie.  Blu ray case had several puncture marks in the back that damaged the plastic and the slip cover.  The disc itself was undamaged and I was able to watch it.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|fun match three game with different. twist must look st rules to know how to get rid pf the things you will find on the new boards. Starts out easy. Then things are added to make achieving. your goal harder.  Good game for all ages.
B00GX598FO|5.0|Great comedy. Good action. Bruce Willis does a good job as an old spy. We'll put together supporting cast. Possible 3rd movie?
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very addictive and hysterically funny. Still glitches a bit after recent update causing inability to control minion movements and inevitable loss of progress, but hopefully this known issue will be resolved soon. Also freezes and crashes in El Nachos lair since update... but it's still loads of laughs.
0786860707|5.0|This is by far the best produced book I received from Amazon.  Well produced, well written, and pages of pages of stories, principles, and materials.  It is entertaining as well as inspirational to read.  And I am glad I bought the 1st edition as others commented, that the color of the artwork maintains its integrity.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love playing it on my kindle fire. I really was glad to see it for my kindle.  I have told my family about it. We all play it almost all the time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good variety of games. Easy to earn points to unlock new games. Games are simple to play and don't require a lot of time.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Just like LoL on pc but is hard to get used to kindle interface after being on pc. Recommend getting especially since it is free
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun and what I think of it is one of the vest games. It is also a very good game for rode trips that take a long time to get to.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is great, although the version of this app that costs real money has more detail and extras it isn't worth the cost. With this game you can have as much fun and as much benefits as the original for free. This is a wonderful game that the whole family will enjoy.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I was waiting to injustice to come in kindle but it was in apple  so i waited and waited but now it now became true. THANK YOU
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Lots of fun! Easy to get the hang of it and more fun than the Facebook version.<br /><br />Get at least two oat fields...
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Awesome great game you should get it also hooks up to the console version of the game<br />Dc superheroes rock
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A very good and enjoyable book.  I love John Grisham as an author and have enjoyed every book I've read of his and this was a really good book.  It kept my interest all the way through but it was very predictable for the most part after about the half way point.  I still highly recommend it and if you don't pay real close attention there will be some surprises.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app it's AWESOME it's the better version of subwaysufers it's much more entertaining I recommend this app fosho
B00GH4R95C|3.0|I am going to blame the writer on this one.  This man clearly likes sex on the first date and then probably spends a lot of money on gifts trying to find romance.  The Superman story is a classic mythology that has been told many times better than this.  Of course he has a ton of video games to his credit, so that explains the jerky back and forth story line that relies on too much flash back, because he wanted to get to the action right away.<br /><br />What this does is steal from the audience, that wonder of self-discovery and conflict of the youthful Clark Kent.  Also lost is the Clack and Lois dance of discovery.  What we are left with is lots of top notch special effects, some clever game puzzle moments and a story that in the end is not satisfying.<br /><br />It would be as if Harry Potter started at the last half of book seven than inserted parts of the previous six books to try to get you to care about the characters you never had a change to grow with.  My wife who enjoys the super hero genre went to bed, annoyed with the whole mess.<br /><br />Particularly bad is the self-indulgent, hot aired pretentious Jonathan Kent, played and I suspect partially written by Kevin Costner at his worst.  Even John Schneider of TV's Smallville was a more down to earth and real father.  {small spoiler}  When we reach the moment of Papa Kent's required death, it is over the top, pretentious and pathetic.  Our reaction was, &#34;I hope that's the last flash back with him in it, glad he's gone. &#34; This moment should bring pain to the audience.. It won't because the relationship is disjointed.<br /><br />When I look at the cast on paper.. this should be a winner.  but in the end.. The writer gave the director very little to salvage out of this weak video game construction.  I gets three stars because I like who this Superman is trying to be you could do something with this cast as long as you never ever let the writer of this film near the franchise.  And I shudder to thinkhe is on track to do Justice League ... I grew up a DC Comics kid.. but now the only decent story telling is happening on the Marvel side.  The Man of Steel is no Iron Man.. and he should be better.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Really great game. I kinda wish customization offered more than just an old bot with a different color though. And it's too hard to get gold coins
B004KKX80A|3.0|Hard to screw the pieces together.  My son is frequently asking me to take it apart and re-assemble but it is hard for me.  The screw should be longer.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is a good time wasting game that keeps me coming back.it could be beter if everything didn't cost so much.
B005R32L66|4.0|Works well, Some distortion in voice and video but not enough to be a problem. Now my Tablet is a wifi phone.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This solitaire game is one of the best! Here are some pros:  1: editable setting for the cards.  2: it is a great game for beginners AND pros alike!  There is only one con i can say: if you choose a winning deal, you have to have wi-fi. Summary: This is an awesome game, and i would really recommend it!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I really did not expect much of this film last summer, not being much of a Brad Pitt fan or of director Marc Foster, the man who directed one of my 5 least-favorite Bond films: Quantum of Solace.  Furthermore, like many, I had heard the stories of a confused script and a new ending forced to be filmed.  However, upon seeing the film, I found it to be a gripping and intense experience.  I watched the blu-ray unrated version yesterday and my opinion hasn't changed.<br />This is an epic film of a world catastrophe going from Philadelphia, (actually Scotland) to North Korea to Israel (actually Malta) and a tense conclusion in Wales.  Like so many of the films of today, this film would not have been possible without CGI, particularly the scene of thousands of zombies climbing over each other to get over an enormous wall protecting Jerusalem. (Probably the type of wall we could use along our porous southern border.)<br />Unlike The Walking Dead, where the world suffers a similar disaster, these zombies do not shamble along, they run and run fast.  And they bite, thats the way the zombie virus is spread. Pitt is surprisingly good (and he should be since he is one of the film's producers.)  I also like Mirielle Enos as his wife.  I've enjoyed her on the AMC series The Killing, and since she is always so grim and depressed on that series, it is nice to see her play a normal role and actually smile here (although, to be frank, the events of this film do not really give one much to smile about.)<br />As stated, this is an unrated cut.  There were some scenes that did not seem too familiar to me although I have to admit that I don't remember what they were.  The picture and sound on the blu-ray were fine.  The special features consisted of several relatively short documentaries on the making of the film. (This is not a Peter Jackson film with 10 hours of special features.)  The &#34;making of&#34; documentaries were fine and just about everyone was interviewed with the exception of Pitt.  (I guess he was too busy.)<br />In conclusion, this is a very exciting, fairly violent and bloody epic  that keeps the suspense and your interest up throughout.  As stated, I did not expect all that much of it, but it turned out to be one of my favorite films of last summer (right behind Star Trek and Man of Steel.)  Check it out, you won't be bored.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a spoof subway surfers but much fun.<br /><br />you can run through Grus lab and have a one on one battle with vecter while avoiding his robots if you can defeat him you'll continue running collecting despicable bonuses and avoiding obstacles on the way<br /><br />or you can run in machos lar or the mall or nude beach<br />don't worry its kid appropriate and tons a fun<br /><br />I would highly recommend this game to people of all ages
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm a hardcore Def Lep fan from wayyyyy back....my boys do not disappoint!!!!  I've seen them live a zillion times (I can't even count how many times, LOL)<br /><br />Hysteria is my favorite album of all time....so awesome hear it straight through.... So nice to hear a few songs that they hardly ever do live!<br /><br />Love that they &#34;opened&#34; for themselves!  And ended the opening with Switch 625....which I tend to dance crazy to when they play it live (yes, I'm THAT person....LOL)<br /><br />Do your eardrums a favor.....GET THIS!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome amazing you get too play feed and enter competitions with your horse I recommend this game for people who like action explore and creativity in games
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter recommend this game and its a blast!!!!<br />The minions are adorable and I am chuckling the whole time playing.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Loved it.  I am a huge Pearl Jam fan and this CD was much more than I expected it to be.
B00FVZJYK6|4.0|It is a great movie but I like #1 better so, 4 stars. Still, it's really funny. It is so different from the first one.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great way to watch Youtube videos on my TV.  I wish I could cast Amazon Instant videos too though.  Ta da.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Great box set in a simple and attractive box set.  The first three volumes of this box set are great (the fourth not so).  Definitely a must for collectors and fans of the franchise.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|It has all been said in the above comments. Destruction porn and trying to make Superman &#34;dark&#34; and brooding was unnecessary.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|It's not a bad movie, but not up to the old James Bond movies. The stunts and action parts seem to be replaced by views of different parts of the world. Cheaper! The old Bond is replaced by a much subdued Bond. Just my opinion.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|On my first game, I am not sure if it is crashing or if it regrets being a free app of the day and is trying to still sell me stuff. When it crashes, it blanks out the screen and brings up the Amazon add, which I never mind, but it is still annoying. It is doubtful I will buy any apps from this company if their paid versions are still going to &amp;#34;crash&amp;#34;.
B0061S073A|1.0|This app was wonderfull! My daughter used it everyday and i had not a single problem with it - until i applyed it's update. Now, even after a fight to uninstall, reinstall, and uninstall again, i wouldn't recomend it. It literally took control of my daughters tablet. I couldn't exit from the app. Everytime i tried it popped up w 'action not allowed' and reloaded itself. Even after disabling the home lock i could only exit the app for a matter of seconds. Repeatedly - i had to hit the home button, select settings, hit the home button, select apps, hit the home button race to select the app, hit the home button (and through the double tab next to it) race to uninstall the program before i had control over the devise again! So long as this program was on here i couldn't access anything but what went through the app. Never again. I'll find something else thank you.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|CastleVille is fun and addicting. I think that it would be best for preteens and teens. It's one of my favorite apps.(or games)
B0094BB4TW|2.0|*  I  cannot adjust settings on news feed<br />*  Kindle does not support most Facebook games<br />*  I can't go to friends pages<br />Overall this app is very disappointing. I can't believe how poorly it performs.
B004QSQMKE|3.0|This is a great film for the whole family. If you like fantasy films about the good guys being out numbered and still being able to triumph over a bad guy who is quite literally the devil, then this is the movie for you. There are some corny lines and acting but what makes up for it is a good story and characters that make it worth being an 80s kid. It has a young Tom cruise still feeling out his acting chops and an incredibly frightening Tim Curry with one of the greatest makeup jobs ever done in Hollywood history. This is Ridley Scott's dream film by the way and FYI he's the guy who made Blade Runner and Alien so it's defiantly worth 2 hours on a Saturday night.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A hard story easy to follow but depressing rather than uplifting like u might expect with a angel involved not for people having problems
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Easy to play. It has the same concept of chess. You have to see the moves before you and then how they will affect your future movements.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This should be rated a 5 star it is a fun game and very addictive. I am only giving it a 3 star because I hate the fact that you can't  just sit down and play it when you want to play it. You have wait for every new life to continue. When you get to the quest you have to wait 3 days to continue because you can only play 1 quest each day. This ruins the fun of the game because when I have time to play I usually can't play because of the previously mentioned reasons.
B006CHML4I|5.0|STRIKING FACE AND THE MOST COMFORTABLE MATERIAL BAND I HAVE EVER OWNED.<br />LIGHTWEIGHT AND MADE WITH GREAT MATERIALS THAT YOU EXPECT WHEN YOU OWN<br />A SEIKO.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones produce clear, professional sound. Perfect acoustics for editing videos! They are pretty comfortable on my head for hours if necessary.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun game. It really makes you think and use your brain. I like it. I can't wait for the other rooms to come.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's fun and addicting at the same time. I really enjoy this game and it challenges you on each level. Couldn't put it down!.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Beautiful and challenging and I will probably do more games from this producer if the advertising isn't too annoying. Hint
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|So I'm playing along, enjoying otherwise boring down time, building my cute little town and completing the challenges. Then I log on and get an update notice, but there's no way to actually update the game. I will never play another Zynga game. I've already been through my Words With Friends corrupting so that I had to remove it from my Kindle. There's no help for fixing whatever's gone wrong. You're just out of luck. Hello, EA games! I'm your newest customer!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a great game . I would recommend it.I saw the movie and love the game but plz add multiplayer online.
B004EPZ070|1.0|This was the worst movie I have ever seen. The only thing that kept me watching it was John Krasinski.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The feast for crows was a bit boring and there were several story lines that went nowhere. This book reignited my interest in the plot. By the end, I feel like I understand so much more of the overall plot. I can imagine there being 5 more books, though. So much yet to happen and even once the Lannisters are driven out of Kings Landing, there is much potential for the story to continue. It stinks I'll probably be waiting a few years for the next one.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|OMG!! I just can't get enough of this show!! Rick, Herschel, Maggie, Glenn, Carl, Michonne, Tyrese, Darryl !!!! If you like Zombies and kicking butt, you will love this show!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fabulous game, my kids and husband love it. Great hand eye coordination activity. Have to set limits or they would play it all day.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Despite the fact that I am still mourning the death of a few characters,excellent read and satisfying ending.  Thank you,  Veronica Roth for such strong characters.
B00EAZTONU|5.0|Really great product. Goes so well with extended LOTR collection. The statue is great too. The best part is that it shipped safely all the way to South Africa. I am really, really pleased with it.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Fast paced and fun game. Minions are really cute! Game is kept fresh with new places to visit and different ways to win. Friend challenges are neat to try too.  Without. purchasing tokens it becomes difficult. to advance which is a bummer.
B00E6D4HHO|5.0|How can anyone write a review for a product not released yet. I think it looks great my final decision will be when i GET the product. They did the same for the new batman box set. And thank  GOD I didnt listen because it ended being a gorgeous set. you have no idea what the claw is made of or how it will feel in your hands. if you wanna say it sucks after you get then fine but not before it hasnt been released unless you aquired some other way migHt that may not EVEN be the real one. look i bought all the blu rays and now i buying this but i dont look at as lost money i get to give my old to my best friend who cant afforfd it and he is so excite that alone is worth it. SO to ALLL the other people reading don't go by what people are saying who havent even purchased it yet it comes out Dec 2. After people receive them then check out the reviews to better judge or like myseld i dont always go by what people say. its a 124 dollard how much more do they want for that price?? Thank you
B001DJLCRC|5.0|These are very good.  No big deal with adult content.  It's really not that bad.  If your comfortable with the overall story you can probably handle the extra material.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|don't get me wrong the game is fun. after the first 5 levels it gets boring.its good if u like to challenge yourself
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|A good movie. Enjoyed it even the second time, but naturally not much to take away and think about, just enjoy it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Best game ever that I played in my life .That game should get ever review as a perfect game .And it also should get five stars in the stars Carigioty
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Best hunting game on my kindle. Downloaded another game but got tired of getting eaten by a wolf and the graphics on this game are better.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I believe it was very well written and also extremely detailed. But instead of giving it 5 stars I gave it 4 stars because i believe Katniss deserved to get a better revolution instead of losing the things and people that motivated her to do the things she did in the first place. But overall it was well done.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The saga continues in A Dance With Dragons. This is not a book that is for a light reader, you have to take your time to absorb everything going on. Once I started I could not put down.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Arrived on time. My granddaughter just got hooked on Grey's Anatomy, and<br />I brought this for her so she can see of it all began.  She enjoyed it very much,<br />I am ordering season 2 for her next . The price was very good .
B00BMNM4H6|2.0|Interesting game!!!! Definitely keeps you moving and thinking, I found it that it gets harder as you move up. Good game.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I've read this book at least 5 times in the past 10 years and each time I think I will manage, but by the final pages, I am devastated.  It is a beautiful, indescribable story.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Chromecast is OK, Hopefully it will improve. There are already Many ways to stream Netflix, Hulu and other &#34;common&#34; sources. What I wanted was the steam from tab in Chrome with the plug-in. So far this has been a poor performer and not compatible with many sources. Most disappointing is not being able to use it with my Amazon Prime Instant Video account. This is not the final or best answer for those of us who do the majority of our viewing off of computers or devices. If you are using Amazon Instant Video or other TV/Movie sources - stick with a computer and HDMI connection. The &#34;supported&#34; venues work well off of laptop, tablet and phone.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I simply love this movie!  Not only is the animation great, but the story teaches great life lessons.  My granddaughter loves this movie as well and we've spent great times watching this movie together.  I highly recommend this movie for the whole family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun game. The storyline and graphics are amazing. My daughter and I find the choice of characters amusing and hallarious.
B004LWZW88|5.0|Another delightful movie I'm glad I purchased for my granddaughter's collection that stays at my home.  I happen to also love this movie for its animation and color quality, but also for its story line.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I think she ended the book a little soon but she put the right people together. Sookie needed to be with Sam and I always hated her with Eric. To much like dating a politician and a caveman mixed. Some people said everyone seemed different. Not to me. Everyone finally showed their true colors. Eric became the lapdog he deserved to be and sookie found true happiness.
B004G6009U|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie, but I love it as well.  It's classical Disney when it comes to the superior quality of the animation and color.  Not only that, but it's a modern twist on the old Rapunzel fairy tale that I'm sure will delight all.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I like the setting that takes place in this book. This book basically describes the life of an Irish CItizen.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I liked this movie so much I had to buy it so I could watch it again and again. I recommend this movie, if you are into zombies and mild sci-fi.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|awesome totally beast you should get it. I cleared 2.4gb the first day I got it. I recommend to every one out there
B0064X7FVE|3.0|App is okay. Liked the old one better because it was easier to set for severe weather alerts. DO NOT play the stupid m points game. It let's you get close to your goal then changes the game making it harder to get points. Also one of the apps it wants you to download will put PORN on your phone. Not one of my faves anymore.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game. I love the increasing challenge each level brings. I can't wait to play again. Thanks
1451629192|5.0|What an amazing read! It was wonderfully written by Jaycee Dugard.  To think the life she had to endure from this evil man and his wife is just incredible that she's here today.
0857685848|5.0|this is absolutely brilliant! I got this for my daughter for Christmas and am absolutely loving the quality of this. She will love it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Fantastic!!  I don't want to give away too much about it but it was a wonderful read. I rarely &#34;highlight&#34; quotes in books but this one had so many wonderful ones.
B00068C7WA|5.0|I really like Billy Joel's songs.  I love to listen to this in the car. and I sing very loud.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It's cool, but my glasses aren't breaking clean. I'm not sure if it's my technique or what, but I've had some pretty funky breaks that cause the bottles to be unusable for drinking glasses.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|i bought this for my son and he loved it.  he is a collector of silent hill things and is looking forward to more
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Let me start by saying that this is not a happy book. Nor is it anything like the first two. What it is, is a realistic, gritty, fascinating war story and character study. This book pulls no punches, nor does it cut any corners. And without further ado, here are the three best things about Mockingjay:<br /><br />1) The Characters<br />Katniss Eveerdeen's character arc is completed in this novel, and it was perfectly closed out. I've heard many complain that she acts out of character for the entirety of this book, but I couldn't agree less. Katniss has been through hell and back again, her home has been destroyed, and one of her best friends has been taken prisoner by The Capitol. By the end of the novel, Katniss has come full circle as a character, and as a person.<br /><br />Along with Katniss, Gale, Peeta, Prim, Johanna, Haymitch, and above all, Finnick, have great closure<br /><br />2) The Realism<br />This is a very realistic story. Katniss doesn't go all &#34;Wonderwoman&#34; on The Capitol, and doesn't just rescue everyone she loves without consequences. She suffers heartbreak and loss on the way to an eventual &#34;victory&#34;. And that's how it should be. This brings me to my third point...<br /><br />3) The Ending<br />I absolutely loved the ending. It showed just how devastating war is, and how it can dramatically affect those in (and around) it. I won't spoil any more, but suffice to say that this ending will tear your heart out. However painful the ending is, it is 100% necessary.<br /><br />And now, my sole qualm with the novel:<br /><br />1) Rushed<br />The book seems slightly rushed. I feel as though Suzanne Collins had a page limit, and was forced to keep her book under 400 pages. This caused some parts to seem rushed, and others to seem bloated. This is the reason that I took a half star off of my review.<br /><br />Overall, this is the best book in THG Trilogy. Read it and weep. You won't regret it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Love this game.  If you haven't tried it by now, you need to get this game now!!! Been playing this for over a year and I'm still loving it!!!
B00BGV0YD0|5.0|This has songs that I had not heard before from the Doors and I love them all, can't stop listening.
B004V9MU86|5.0|I am a 44 year old male father of two girls. It made me cry. I think that makes for a great review.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very funny movie, the kids love it and so did we...lol...now we have to watch the next part. I wish these were included in the Prime membership.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Good read for anyone who want to start their own business.If you are low on money and ideas then buy this book.Might change your life.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was funny, sad, thought provoking. I think there will be some who prefer not to read this type of book.  It is very happy and sad.  I would  have made the same choices as either one of them made.  I remember a old movie called &#34;Whose Life is it Anyway&#34;  with the same needs starring Richard Dreyfus. We have come along way but we still have a long way to go when some is not capable of doing for themselves.<br /><br />This is a very good story with real needs that has been presented in a very thoughtful way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was so breath taking. So moving and you have to read the second book to keep the story going. The book is so descriptive you can picture everything.
0316044695|5.0|This was a gift for my husband's birthday. It came QUICK and he loves it! He can't wait for the movie to come out in December.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Although I was,disappointed in the outcome based on choosing sides it  was difficult to put this book down.  I also like fiction based on actual events in history
B005WMQFOQ|1.0|The doll shown and described is a Mattel doll. The doll I received is a Universal product and not the Mattel doll I was looking for. The hair is very different. I'm very disappointed and it will have to go back.
B001BANK32|5.0|I've watched the movie dozens of times through my life and I had so many unanswered questions. I get it now. Excellent book, thick vocabulary and a rush that keeps the reader riveted.
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|It took me about 2-3 days to fully appreciate this album.  I would have initially given it a 3 but now has evolved to a solid 4.  This album is different than her previous ones and can best be characterized as Electronic dance although there is an R&B and rap number in there too.  I admit I am unable to comprehend the overall ArtPop concept of the album.  If anything I find it a bit chaotic and lacking a degree of cohesiveness.  Having said that it's still a fun album that generally doesn't take itself too seriously (with the exception of Dope which I don't care for). My favorites include Do what u want, GUY, gypsy, Fashion and Donatella.  While i wouldn't say this is Gaga's best, I think it's still pretty good.
B000NY12LO|5.0|As usual, Jodi Picoult takes a current subject and leads you through all sides of it. She never takes sides or even leads you to take sides. She merely takes a touchy issue and forces you to look at it through all those who are unwillingly forced to be a part of the problem. You end up with a deeper understanding of (and greater sympathy for) all who struggle with being forced to become part of a very difficult social issue.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Not a bad way to pass the time.  Lots of different puzzles to pass the time.  Don't have to play all in one sitting.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Better than the first Red.<br />This movie was  funny and full of action . I hope there is a RED 3 in the future
B00F87ZUYG|1.0|I would give it 0.0 it won't let me watch the video. I have not had a problem with previous purchases
B0033AI48Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting and scripting is wonderful. This story helps show that there is always hope, even when life seems hopeless.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very interesting and great how all of the characters lives were intertwined! Lots of secrets in this book....characters could be real in today's world.
B00FOT936Y|4.0|Must read for anyone who's starting a career.  Questions the world where money is almost the only parameter of judging success. Very nice read.
B00C7607FS|5.0|Usually classic love stories like this start with a pizza delivery or a plumbing repair but this one gets going with a Prince's dog finding a nude girl washed up the beach with no voice.  After the prince lets her stay in his beach front castle the fun begins.  If the Prince lived in Malibu he would be Charlie Sheen.  Not many guys will let nude girls who comb their hair with forks stay at their place.  The nude girl only has three days to get the &#34;kiss of true love&#34; or the witch will keep her voice and she will go back to being a women of the sea.  The witch turns herself into a hot brunette copy of the nude girl but uses the voice to seduce the prince.  After some weird animal scenes the witch loses the nude girls voice.  Just as it looks like she is going back to being a women of the sea, the Prince saves her and rams the witch with his massive wood stern killing her.  This movie is every mans dream.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is so addicting, fun, and I can't put it down started playing it 3 days ago and all ready level 11
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|basically this is a green banana when it comes to network streaming. Doesn't support your own media files, which is a big drawback. No very many apps, give it some time and maybe it will turn yellow.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP THERE ARE NO BAD REVIEWS!!! I ALWAYS CAN NEVER WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT NEW UPDATE!!!!!!! EVERYBODY HAS GOT TO GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!
0385528752|5.0|Below are  key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1) &#34;What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem.&#34;<br /><br />2) &#34;Now you've had a glimpse of the basic three-part framework we will unpack in this book, one that can guide you in any situation where you need to change behavior: 1) Direct the Rider. What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. So provide crystal-clear direction. 2) Motivate the Elephant. What looks like laziness is often exhaustion. The Rider can't get his way by force for very long. So it's critical that you engage people's emotional side—get their Elephants on the path and cooperative. 3) Shape the Path. What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. We call the situation (including the surrounding environment) the &#34;Path.&#34; When you shape the Path, you make change more likely, no matter what's happening with the Rider and Elephant.&#34;<br /><br />3) &#34;The Miracle Question doesn't ask you to describe the miracle itself; it asks you to identify the tangible signs that the miracle happened...Once they've helped patients identify specific and vivid signs of progress, they pivot to a second question, which is perhaps even more important. It's the Exception Question: &#34;When was the last time you saw a little bit of the miracle, even just for a short time?&#34;&#34;<br /><br />4) &#34;Big problems are rarely solved with commensurately big solutions. Instead, they are most often solved by a sequence of small solutions, sometimes over weeks, sometimes over decades. And this asymmetry is why the Rider's predilection for analysis can backfire so easily. When the Rider analyzes a problem, he seeks a solution that befits the scale of it. If the Rider spots a hole, he wants to fill it, and if he's got a round hole with a 24-inch diameter, he's gonna go looking for a 24-inch peg. But that mental model is wrong.&#34;<br /><br />5) &#34;Ambiguity is the enemy. Any successful change requires a translation of ambiguous goals into concrete behaviors. In short, to make a switch, you need to script the critical moves.&#34;<br /><br />6) &#34;In creating change, though, we we're interested in goals that are closer at hand—the kinds of things that can be tackled by parents or middle managers or social activists. We want a goal that can be tackled in months or years, not decades. We want what we might call a destination postcard—a vivid picture from the near-term future that shows what could be possible.&#34;<br /><br />7) &#34;The Rider's strengths are substantial, and his flaws can be mitigated. When you appeal to the Rider inside yourself or inside others you are trying to influence, your game plan should be simple...First, follow the bright spots...Next, give direction to the Rider.&#34;<br /><br />8) &#34;Kotter and Cohen observed that, in almost all successful change efforts, the sequence of change is not ANALYZE-THINK-CHANGE, but rather SEE-FEEL-CHANGE. You're presented with evidence that makes you feel something. It might be a disturbing look at the problem, or a hopeful glimpse of the solution, or a sobering reflection of your current habits, but regardless, it's something that hits you at the emotional level. It's something that speaks to the Elephant.&#34;<br /><br />9) &#34; Most of the big problems we encounter in organizations or society are ambiguous and evolving. They don't look like burning platform situations, where we need people to buckle down and execute a hard but well-understood game plan. To solve bigger, more ambiguous problems, we need to encourage open minds, creativity, and hope.&#34;<br /><br />10) &#34; In the identity model of decision making, we essentially ask ourselves three questions when we have a decision to make: Who am I? What kind of situation is this? What would someone like me do in this situation? Notice what's missing: any calculation of costs and benefits. The identity model explains the way most people vote, which contradicts our notion of the &#34;self-interested voter.&#34;&#34;<br /><br />11) &#34;That's the paradox of the growth mindset. Although it seems to draw attention to failure, and in fact encourages us to seek out failure, it is unflaggingly optimistic. We will struggle, we will fail we will be knocked down—but throughout, well get better, and we'll succeed in the end.&#34;<br /><br />12) &#34;Change isn't an event; it's a process. There is no moment when a monkey learns to skateboard; there's a process. There is no moment when a. a child learns to walk; there's a process. And there won't be a moment when your community starts to invest more in its school system, or starts recycling more, or starts to beautify its public spaces; there will be a process. To lead a process requires persistence. A long journey requires lots of mango.&#34;ains the way most people vote, which contradicts our notion of the &#34;self-interested voter.&#34;&#34;<br /><br />11) &#34;That's the paradox of the growth mindset.

B00FATEJYE|5.0|Never played it till now but it is a very good game.If you.like super heroes this is the game for you.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Finally on android. I've been waiting for this for quite a while and now it's here. Can't wait to unlock the costumes for the console edition.<br /><br />Update. This game is great for being free, there are a lot of character and power cards to unlock. The costumes you unlock for the console are quite good, especially the batman beyond skin. Overall a great game.
B00F2362IE|5.0|This game is AWESOME.When you get the bar at the top of the screan full you get a power up type of thingy.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This Battery HD APP is very nice! Always accurate and very easy to use! The features that come with this are nice.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not at all what I expected, this was a great book. Looking forward to more books from Suzanne . .
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is soooooo fun I love it I play with my fiance on this game. the only thing I do t like is of how much and how long you have to wait for a new area. other than that I LOVE IT.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is one of the best possible games to play that's for free<br />Awesome awesome awesome may I repeat AWESOME
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|Wonderful movie. The little boy is played by the person who is now Batman. He does a wonderful job. I highly recommend this movie
B00G32TD98|5.0|A real scary feature is the best discription. The scenes are schocking, quick and very intense. I was afraid to watch this movie a second time because it creeped me out that much. I gave it five stars for that reason alone. Warning: Don't watch it alone. SKC 11.30.13
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think candy crush is magical. All the beautiful colours burst on the screen. I personally recommend this for you. I KNOW you will like it.
B00COHIFQS|5.0|One of the best written and well performed thrillers of the season. It is edge of your seat eye ball to screen kind of film that is thought provoking as it unfolds. There is never a dull moment.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is awesome. I recommend it to anybody that elves hunting cause it feels like the real thing!<br />The graphics are really realistic and the shots are accurate unlike hunting reloaded.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Loved it from the beginning and had the most fun and funniest moments on this game. Hope every one else loves it to. But I will have to say it will get boring after awhile like temple run
B009WUBERW|5.0|Fun movie with lots of action and a few tidbits of comedy that were well placed in the script.  Would watch again.
0385537131|5.0|A sequel to [[ASIN:0440245915 A Time to Kill: A Novel]].  Several years have passed.  Jake Brigance is still living in Ford County, struggling along to earn a living as a small town attorney in competition with other attorneys, and living in a rental house after his original home was burned by the Klan.  Now he has a new case - a wealthy white man has left 90 percent of his estate to his black housekeeper, deliberately cutting his children and grandchildren out of his will.  The man tended to be a loner, divorced twice, and with an eye for women.  Now the fight is on.  Jake is the attorney representing the estate, a potentially lucrative position if the case lingers on and goes through appeals (I believe Dickens wrote a novel about that).<br /><br />The book goes through details of legal maneuvering as the litigants go through discovery and eventually the trial.  There is a lot of back story about everyone involved, and some details about the racist past in Mississippi.  Keeping in mind that the author started his career as a small town attorney in Mississippi, the story is well researched.  This is a prize winning novel by any set of standards, possibly a Pulitzer Prize.  It is certainly one of the best novels of 2013.
B002WJI65S|5.0|Goomba has always been one of my favorite characters, and this plush doll caught the essential qualities of a Goomba; short round and cute. The size and details are perfect!
B0087DFIOU|5.0|Shows what is likely the true corruption that goes on in Mexican prisons...but then, I've never been in prison in either the USA or Mexico :-)  Great acting, especially by the young boy.  Does crime pay...well, in this case partially.
B002WJI66C|5.0|Look like an original Boo character from the series, and its measurement to the rest of the characters is perfect. It is not too big when compared to Mario, just right.
B00170F0WU|1.0|Generally when I write a review, I try to take a little time to be sharp and thoughtful, but this movie doesn't deserve it.  It's just preposterous, stupid, disgusting nonsense.  I wish I hadn't wasted two hours.  Maybe I missed the whole point but somehow the movie seemed to support the idea that Leon was a hero because he murdered so many police officers.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Good, but not the &#34;Old Bond&#34; unfortunately. Good plot and follow-up. It was just lacking something, although I can't tell you what.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Darlene really brought together quite the team of folks to assist her on this project.  The one artist who might be getting overlooked here is the incomparable Miriam Webster.  Although she was not a featured singer it truly Made Me Glad to see Miriam up on stage with Darlene.  For those who never heard of Miriam Webster, trust me, her songs are very very awesome indeed.  It was no mistake that I typed Made Me Glad in capital letters since that is the name of her stellar solo CD.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I bought this charger for my Android phone.  It arrived within the expected time frame.  The product is simple and pretty solid.  Though, I can charge my phone and my daughter's iPhone at the same time, I haven't done it yet.  Overall, it is a great product.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the best $35 I have ever spent. This device is like magic, and I am an IT. In just a few minutes it almost sets itself up. I plugged it into my HDMI port on my TV and not only powered up the TV but started installing itself! Once the software had loaded on my laptop I was ready to stream media. Next I set it up to stream from my smart phone.  One issue I did discover is that after the Chromecast app is loaded on the phone I needed to update my media apps, like Netflix, Youtube, Pandora. I have an Internet TV but it has always had issues streaming from Netflix, but with the Google Chromecast it works all the time.  The &#34;magic&#34; in this device is one you start streaming you can use your phone, tablet, computer for other task. I am streaming music right now while composing this review.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Thought it was a very good read but the ending was a little weak. Grisham is a master at defining characters though.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very interesting read. Intro was almost as good as the book. Very insightful about how &#34;big money&#34; controls so much in this world.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It sets a whole new bar for the super hero movie.  Since it's theatrical release, others have done it as well, but this one, in my opinion, will always be the first one to get it right.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read and reread this over and over and it never gets old. By far my favourite book of all time
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. They are so adorable, I think I have become addicted to this game. Are there other ways to earn money other than buying them?
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|wow. I look forward to more Preston child's novels. I also hope Corrine will continue on. since her debut in one of my favourites still life with crows.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I really like this game. Simple enough for kids to play the easier levels and fun and challenging for adults.
