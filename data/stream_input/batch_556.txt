B000001G5H|2.0|I used to think it was hilarious that people found Pollini's recording the best, but now I've realized that it is only because they haven't heard Garrick Ohlsson's recording. <br /> <br />Ohlsson's recording of these etudes contains FAST tempos, similar to Pollini (usually a bit faster still), but he actually makes music out of them; fancy that. <br /> <br />Pollini's interpretations sound all Forte, all emotionless/expressionless.  His \\"ocean\\" etude (c minor) sounds like a heart attack.  Ohlsson's actually sounds like the ocean.  The difference is insanely noticable; check out Ohlsson's recording now. <br /> <br />Get the Ohlsson over this.  Enough said.

Read about the way societies succeed, and fail, and think about all the similarities to other great empires that had no thought about ending.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|First off, let me answer one of the complaints that I've been hearing a lot. Strawberry Fields Forever is not here because it did not reach number one. It reached #2 in the U.K., due to a poor decision by Brian Epstein to release Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields on a double A-side(at least that's what I've heard). Anyways, Penny Lane reached #1, Strawberry Fields didn't, let's move on. Should you buy this album? If you don't wish to purchase the anthology, and don't have any of the original albums, go ahead. If not, forget about it. It's a waste of money. If you're just starting out, it's a great way to gather a lot of great music in one fell swoop. Just keep in mind that  <br />none of the songs from Sgt. Peppers, Rubber Soul, or With the Beatles are on here. That's a lot of music to miss out on. <br />Not to mention the fact that great songs like Revolution and I  <br />Am the Walrus, which were moved to B-side to make room for Paul's work, aren't on here either. I'd say that you should purchase with caution, but what the hell, I got it for ten bucks at Target, so it's not that big of a waste anyway.

B000B8QEYC|4.0|My first inclination toward Amarantine was to be very disappointed. But I decided that I would wait and see how I felt in a few weeks. When I first heard `Watermark' I disliked it for weeks. Anyway, I have waited for a few weeks and am ready to give me review, I know how long you've all waited to hear it. <br /> <br /> First off the picture is a good representation of the music on the CD. It is of a more stark nature and very simple. Don't come into this hoping for Sheppard Moons or the Celts because you won't find it here. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Less then a Pearl : I was impressed with this piece right away but was unsure of the mood it was trying to show until my sister gave me an insight into it. \\"Think of it as a mourning song,\\" I do and it all makes sense. I personally love this one but everyone might not think so. <br /> <br /> Amarantine : This is the first catchy song of the CD and is a good way to get into it. However, after a bit I do get tired of it. Amarantine is rather like cotton candy, good for a while, but you wouldn't want to eat it forever. I also thought the video for this was a little bare. <br /> <br /> It's In The Rain:  This song is one of my least favorites because I feel as though it was unfinished somehow. I like the rhyme and bounce it gives and it has a more traditional swirl to it. But I find that I skip this track more then any of the others. <br /> <br /> If I Could Be Where You Are:  I listen to this track and am never disappointed. I love Enya's ballads and this is one of the good ones. I think of \\"When the Evening Falls\\" as another one. This is bitter sweet in its simplistic nature. I think that Enya's deeper vocals give this a more real sound. It's like something that anyone might feel. As a writer this is a big influence on my work. <br /> <br /> The River Sings:  My first metal image was of people working together and singing to pass the time. This song lifts the heart and gives you the desire to move and dance and you feel happy for on good reason. This is one of the best racks and has a real Enya flavor. This is also one that you will have a hard time tiring of. <br /> <br /> Long, Long Journey:  This is by far my all time favorite track on this CD. The lyrics and melody give it almost a lullaby air. Everyone in my family loves this song and (even the boys) know all the words by heart. It shows that while we are away we have the joy of knowing that soon we will be home. A master piece indeed. <br /> <br /> Sumiregusa:  A moving and flowing piece that will leave you wondering in a beautiful frame of mind. This is also one of the more traditional Enya songs in its sound. Of course the Language, (Japanese) is different but that's about it. This does not happen to be one of my favorites but I couldn't tell you why. I still don't know why myself. <br /> <br /> Someone Said Goodbye :  This is another one of the bouncy songs. It has a more `been there, done that' feel. Where in her songs Enya usually shows love in a more distant way thi seems to be something she feels inside herself.  This also makes me feel sad because I know people like this. I think the lyrics could have been better.  <br /> <br /> A Moment Lost :  This sounds ever so much like someone who has had a terrible argument with their spouse and is trying to make it right again. It's lovely and gentle with just the right bit of sadness that you would feel after arguing with someone. Beautiful! <br /> <br /> Drifting : I make one secret that I thought this was a pointless track when I first heard it. However, I think is one of the hidden master pieces on this CD. Slow and tender you really have to listen to this one an let it soak into you before an hasty judgments are made. The cello work was perfect and deeply moving.  <br /> <br /> Amid The Falling Snow :  My second favorite track on this CD and one of the brightest gems. The playful air and sound sets everyone to dancing around the house (my family is weird) and singing along. It is a wonderful little winter time piece that could fit into an Christmas CD in the business.  <br /> <br /> Water Shows The Hidden Heart:  Perhaps I haven't given this one enough time, but I do not think it is as great as everyone else seems to.  I am not fond of this song and can't decide quite why. I think perhaps because I feel that in this song there is no point. No story or feeling but wandering around for...no....reason. I don't like the sound of the Loxian in this either...The words are interesting in what they say but there's no real....I am wandering again sorry...but I thin it's too long and rather boring. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />I think over all that the lyrics should have been better and that it was not quite worth the five year wait But I still love the CD and would encourage people to get it. I think that it should be taken apart from the things Enya has done in the past. I think that `May It Be' was better then some of the songs on this CD were.  <br /> <br /> However, it is still a good CD just not what I think everyone was hoping for. <br />
0307276902|5.0|this book is probably the best book I have read in 10 years.  Which really surprised me since I just grabbed it in an airport knowing nothing about it.  It is inspiring for any kind of life struggle -- not just addiction.  And I say Pshaw to those who say this is not a good example for other addicts -- it is HIS story and it worked for HIM.
B000AA305M|5.0|The album itself is great, perhaps David Gray's best.  This is an opinion that most would agree with.  However, many are giving this album one star ratings because they are mad with Sony for the protection they placed upon the CD.  Well, I understand that you are angry with Sony, but don't punish David Gray's work itself by marking the music itself down.  Instead of punishing Sony with your low rating, you are possibly dissuading many who would purchase his music after they see a three-and-a-half star rating on Amazon.  Rate the music on Amazon based upon how good the music is, and complain to Sony directly.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This album is simply the best of Elvis Presley. It includes all of his classic hits. Its filled with classics such as Love Me Tender, Hound Dog, Jailhouse Rock, Dont be Cruel, All Shook Up. <br />It also includes later hits Such as Suspicious Minds, In the Ghetto and many others. <br />This is a great addition to anyones record collection and certainly a must for any Elvis fan who does not already have these songs in their library
B000B8QEZG|2.0|On Madonna's latest offering (In a long line of albums, this is her 17th studio album, she's also featured on 4 soundtracks and 5 compilations. Along with releasing 66 singles, in which 59 are hers and 7 she has featured on), she goes back to when she hit her straps and has gone back to the disco days. In fact, there are no ballads on this album, no signs of a ballad either. This album has 12 tracks, and 12 are faced paced, high intensity tracks and 10 run for more than 4 mins each, with the other 2 only just coming shy of 4 mins. She's packed in plenty here and the album runs just under an hour, clocking in at 56:28. Her previous effort flopped by her standards and listening to it, you knew why, but thankfully, she has polished off some dust and put on some new material and this album is as flamboyantly disco as anything I have ever heard. So, is it that good? Well, I have read other reviews of this album, especially in Australia and I haven't seen anything under 4 stars out of 5, but to me, I don't think its worth 4, I disagree, I'm giving it 2 1/2. <br /> <br /> By now, everyone knows the sound of 'Hung Up', and instantly if you don't like it, steer clear. The album, not even once, drops the intensity of 'Hung Up', it's disco the entire way. 'Hung Up' is a highlight and a good album opener, but unfortunately, by half-way through the second song, you feel like fast forwarding. Because plain and simple, Track 2 'Get Together' is unforgivingly annoying and repetitive. Thank God track 3 'Sorry' makes amends otherwise the album could've steered into a disaster very quickly. 'Sorry' is poptastically innovative, sounding very much like 'Hung Up'. <br /> 'Future Lovers' sounds like it was created by robots in outer space, again it sounds refreshing and new, however it is far from a standout. The album then makes a right-hand turn into \\"electronic sounding Madonna\\" with 'I Love New York'. It's a danceworthy track that will be a massive hit in night clubs, if released, along with the entire album. The song however, is also far from the albums best, but still good. Track 6 'Let It Will Be' is annoyingingly repetitive and Track 7 'Forbidden Love' is not much better. At this point, you are hoping that the album picks up. Because from the first 7 tracks, only 2 and perhaps three (I Love New York) are worthy listens. And your prayers are answered with 'Jump'. However at this point, everything is beginning to sound the same, and it wouldn't have hurt to throw in a ballad or two to first, slow things down and secondly, to throw in a different sound. <br /> With track 9 'How High', Madonna hits her strides, the way she did with 'Hung Up' and 'Sorry'. It is a very good track, and has a slightly different feel to the rest. 'Isaac', track 10, is among the worst on the album. A pointless inclusion to the album and it sounds frighteningly like her previous stuff with the \\"MMMMmmmm's\\" put into it. It's almost as if its of middle-eastern descent. Terrible! But thankfully, the final two tracks on the album save it from a 1 1/2 out of 5. They single handedly take it to a 2 1/2. 'Push' is the album standout and sounds like nothing I've heard before, an instant classic and 'Like It Or Not' is possibly fourth best on the album. It also sounds unique and Madonna's vocals are great too. It feels like a hip swinging fiesta when its heard. Fantastic! <br /> <br /> Overall, this album will be an instant classic with her Gay community (with whom she has a HUGE following), because to put it simply, it is an outright disco album, meant for dancing and having a good time. But unfortunately that doesn't cut it for me, an album has to be diverse and not have so many of the same old same old songs lined up back to back together. And this is what Madonna's 'Confessions On A Dancefloor' is. Not so much terrible is the album, as it is disappointing. It could have easily been saved with a ballad or two, but she has stuck with the outright disco feel. Good, but expected much more. 2 1/2. <br />
1591391105|3.0|I bought \\"The First 90 days\\" by Michael Watkins and Neff/Citrin's book titled \\"You're in Charge - Now What.\\"  I found Neff's book to be a stronger and more practical guide.  Both offered excellent guidance however Neff & Citrin produced a more interesting and readable (less text-book like) book with real life examples and a road map.  Word of warning in that both books are written for senior business management and less applicable for lower levels of management or line positions.
B000BVD460|4.0|Eminem has got a great back catalogue of albums, and this here is no exception. His 'Curtain Call: The Hits' album is filled with fantastic singles that he has released from his back catalogue. And he's thrown in some future singles too, thankfully, they are worthy. <br />  After an interesting Intro, where Eminem does 'Grease', we are thrown very quickly into the now familiar playful persona of Eminem. 'Fack' is possibly the most uncomfortable listen of a song he has ever done. And that's saying something. But among the dirtiness of it, it sounds great and is very funny and cheeky. It is a highlight of the album. Then, the album steers into very familiar territory, Eminem's hits. 'The Way I Am' and 'My Name Is' both sound fantastic, and are both very cheeky, but it isnt until Eminem's best ever song 'Stan' comes on, on track 5, that it is realised, that Eminem is best when he is serious. 'Lose Yourself' from the movie '8 Mile' is also great and it is clear why Dr. Dre was so interested in snapping him up. 'Shake That' featuring Nate Dogg, is a quick, booty shaking number that is very clever and it sounds refreshingly good too. But from Track 8, 'Sing For The Moment' to track 12 'Mockingbird', Eminem hits a slump. With only 'Without Me' and 'The Real Slim Shady' worth mentioning. After that though, is the fantastic 'Guilty Conscience' featuring Dr. Dre. It is hilarious and sounds great too, it is a guilty pleasure listening to it, just like 'Fack'. 'Cleaning Out My Closet' and 'Just Lose It' follow, but fail to ignite, with the latter being slightly better. And then comes 'When I'm Gone', easily one of his best ever released singles, this song has everything you would ever want in a dramatically charged rap song. Incredible! Then finally it's 'Stan' again with Elton John doing Dido's original part. I don't know what it is, but it just doesn't have the energy and drama that made the original so brilliant. <br /> <br />  Overall, Eminem has had some great songs, butalso some stinkers too. But the good easily overcomes and hides the bad here, which makes me give this album a 4. His serious stuff is his best, but every now and then, Eminem comes up with a very clever, funny non-serious song. All I have to say is, thank God the vile 'Ass Like That' wasn't included. Phew!
B000BW7QWW|1.0|Don't buy this should-have-stuck-to-the-small-screen movie.  There are reasons for movie rentals.  This is one.  FX's are great.  Script is so tedious and goes nowhere during the first hour.  First five minutes are among the best.  Try Cowboy Bee bop for the real thing.
B0007O38F8|5.0|<br />Hands down, 50 Cent is definitely one of the greatest rappers of all time, dead or alive. He started out small on Columbia records, releasing several underground albums before being shot 9 times and having his record company disown him. But instead of losing hope and giving up rap all together, 50 let his wounds heal over and signed up to work with two of rap's finest, Dr. Dre and Eminem (although neither of them come even close to touching Fiddy), and was soon back on his feet, better than ever. He could've let the gun wounds turn him into a bitter, enraged person, but instead, he released his G-Unit debut full of deep, introspective lyrics about life and how he handled everything. We can really learn something from this guy: no matter what trials you face, you have to come back. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.  <br /> <br />After GRODT sold well over a million records, many thought it would be hard to beat. But nevertheless, 2 years later, 50 came out with a new record, even deeper and more personal than the last record. Sure, 50 may be carrying a lot of guns and talking about killing people, but we all know that deep down, 50 Cent is a \\"cent\\"-sitive person who wouldn't harm a fly. Few people appreciate 50 for what he's done for the world of rap. So before you start hating on him, think about all the good he's done for the world since releasing his music.  <br /> <br />And why the hell does anybody consider Jay-Z to be the greatest rapper alive? He's so self-promoting it's sick! I'm glad he retired, because now he won't put out all that crap.
0060825219|1.0|I am a great admirer of Coelho's other works but this one was an utter disappointment.There was nothing obsessive except the idea of obsessiveness. I became so bored that half way through the book I almost decided not to finish it. Reading \\"11 Minutes\\" after \\"The Zahir\\" will surely not only cheer you up, but also make you wonder if the author was the same one who wrote both novels.
0140177396|5.0|This tightly crafted story's surface level of life for Depression-era farm hands in Caifornia kept my interest even though that's not the sort of thing I'm usually drawn to.   <br /> <br />This book showed me a dimension to humanity I had never before been able to articulate:  The paradoxal, divine, yet fungamenta nature of friendship.   <br /> <br />Steinbeck's gritty characters and setting are the perfect vehicle for a message that only sounds intellectual until you feel it.  There is no fanfare, no flourish of trumpets, no pomp and circumstance, no canned philosophy -- just raw emotional truth. <br /> <br />Some stories hold the mind's attention; this one touched my soul and made me simultaneously both proud and ashamed to be human. We are capable of ugliness but also such loving sacrifice.  For a little book, it packs quite a punch.   <br /> <br />I am breathless.  Give this book an afternoon and you will be too.
0441172717|5.0|I will keep this brief. This is one of the mostly richly filled stories ever written. It has great action, intrigue and moves quick. But what sets it apart from the rest is the unique outlook on human nature and the way the universe works. Although set in the future, it is a very plausable concept of where we as a species may evolve to. I read it every time I start a new job for its machiavellian intrigues and insight into human nature. I am now on my 6th copy, having worn out a couple and given a couple away. Do yourself a favor and get this one, you will be a smarter sharper more intutive individual for reading it.

It is clever, and uses many different approaches to help the reader retain the information. <br /> <br />Note that this book isn't a reference manual; it's more like a very well-crafted laboratory notebook containing examples and explanations of what your experiments are, why they work, and how you can help yourself remember the material. <br /> <br />I'm working my way through Head First Servlets and JSPs now, and can't wait to pick up the Head First Design Patterns book next - they're THAT well written.
B00006I53S|4.0|Finding unbiased, reasonable, reviews of camera lenses can be more difficult than one might imagine. A large percentage of the reviewers deem anything that does not live up to the quality of the highly esteemed \\"L\\" class of Canon lenses to be, frankly, inferior.  <br /> <br />I almost didn't buy this lens because so many members of a forum that I frequent bashed this lens and recommended the 24-105L as the only really \\"good\\" choice in the focal range I wanted. Fortunately for me good sense pevailed and I bought the 28-135 anyway. The fact that the 24-105L was three times the price ($1200) certainly weighed heavily on my decision.  <br /> <br />SO GLAD I DID. <br /> <br />This lens is well built, has a very usable focal range and (at least my copy) is RAZOR sharp. I expected good quality of a lens this price, but I was not at all prepared for the stunningly sharp images that it renders. Color and contrast are very good. The other good \\"walkaround\\" lens in this price point is the 17-85mm. I tend to prefer a longer focal length and the 28-135 qualified me for Canon's generous triple rebates so the choice was clear. F3.5 is fairly fast and the IS does allow hand holding in lighting conditions that would otherwise necessitate a tripod, but for very low lighting you may want to try the 50mm F1.8 prime (They're only $80, buy one). <br /> <br />So if you are hesitating to buy the 28-135mm for any reason please don't listen to the \\"L\\" snobs, it's a great great lens.
B000002GB4|4.0|Crystal Ball, the 1976 release by Styx, is almost unmistakably of their most underrated releases, and in many terms I'd say that it is their most underrated release. Common knowledge holds that this was the first album to feature newcomer Tommy Shaw from Alabama, and his presense is immediately felt. Styx's first five albums were all quite experimental - even the previous year's release of \\"Equinox\\" had some very experimental outings on it, and a lot of it was due to John Curulewski, who left immediately after \\"Equinox\\" was released. This album, on the other hand, provides Styx with their most straight-forward outing up to this time. It also provided some of their best and most underrated material.  <br /> <br />As previously stated, this album was, at the time, the most straight-forward release of Styx's career, which gives the album an immediately brighter sound and feel. This is much to the album's strength, but in many way it makes the album pale instrumentally next to \\"Equinox\\". Although \\"Equinox\\" was a more complex outing than \\"Crystal Ball\\", its' songs often lacked hooks (which had become rather constant in every prior album release). From the onset, every single one of the songs on \\"Crystal Ball\\" has a memorable hook that you may find yourself humming to yourself more than once!  <br /> <br />When people talk about \\"Crystal Ball\\", they often say that \\"this album is suggestive of things to come with Styx\\" in it's relationship with \\"Grand Illusion\\", but this is a better album. It's arena rock at it's finest, and the only time that Styx managed to match it was on \\"Pieces of Eight\\". Check this album out if you're a Styx fan in general - or a fan of good rock music. This album will not disappoint you.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|After reading rave review after rave review about how this was the best album of the year, I had extrememly high expectations that \\"Funeral\\" would knock my socks off.  I didn't know what their sound would be like... and it sounds cliche but when I put it in the CD player and the first track came on, I knew I loved it.  That first track, \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\", is still my favorite song on the album, with \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" coming in an extremely close second.  It's a great mix of up-beat, energetic, exciting songs (\\"Neighborhood #1\\" and #3, \\"Rebellion\\"), mellow tracks (\\"In the Backseat\\", \\"Neighborhood #4\\", \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\", \\"Crown of Love\\"), and the rest which to me are kind of stuck in between.  The lyrics go beyond those of typical artists, even typical \\"indie\\" artists, and along with their unique sound, the band seems to transcend the restrictive labels of a specific genre of music.  There's not much else to say except buy it... and this is an album you should actually purchase and not just download, because the liner notes provide interesting background/information about the album and the artists behind it.  It's worth it.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|This is another Western series that I bought from Columbia House (everything that they would sell) in VHS format, something like 50 episodes.<br /><br />The only problem with releasing \\"Maverick\\" as a limited 'sampler' is that the standard for DVD sets is release by seasons, so people won't buy a few episodes when they know that they can get a full season for $30 (or less.) So, by taking a limited marketing approach, Warners (or whoever made this decision) has corrupted the information they probably hoped to acquire about the potential for a more robust - full seasons - release.<br /><br />As much as I like Clint Walker, for example, Clint is not James Garner. Garner has such a strong track record with \\"Maverick\\" and \\"Rockford Files\\", plus his extensive film career, that holding back on a robust release of \\"Maverick\\" is the mark of a wimp, not a cautious marketing scheme.<br /><br />I also bought almost everything that Columbia House offered for the 30 minute episodes of \\"Gunsmoke\\"... and I see that \\"Gunsmoke\\" is being sold not as seasons but as 'volumes' with selected episodes from the first 9 seasons. That may well work better for marketing purposes, but Columbia House released the episodes in chronological order, and I can tell you that to see \\"Gunsmoke\\" in order of release is VASTLY preferable to seeing the episodes selected using any other rule of thumb. To fully appreciate \\"Gunsmoke\\" you have to transport yourself back in time, into the homes across the country which were being lighted by B&W TV so powerful that \\"Gunsmoke\\" was truly the first \\"must see TV\\" series.<br /><br />Anything less than a release of the seasons of Gunsmoke in order of release, is a cheat of not only the consumer but also to demean the brilliant efforts of the cast. I understand that \\"Gunsmoke\\" has epsiode commentary by James Arness and Dennis Weaver as well as other guest stars, so I will probably buy Volume 1 just for that, but personally, I want to experience this groundbreaking series as close to the way it was originally presented as possible. Over and out.ng series as close to the way it was originally presented as possible. Over and out.
B00005JOHI|5.0|The characters were amazing, the scenes were lovely, and the pacing was excellent.  Late teens and up should find this a delightful romp through romance.

B00005JJX8|5.0|Cary Grant is The Cat, a one-time burglar on the French Riviera who's now gone straight, but is suspected in a recent rash of burglaries. He decides the only way to clear his name is to catch the thief himself. Along the way he meets Grace Kelly, and a romance blossoms.<br /><br />Hitchcock goes more for sophisticated fun than suspense here, and succeeds quite well. Grant is eloquent and droll, and Kelly is livelier than usual - and quite lovely to look at, too. Basically a piece of fluff for Hitch, but done very well. The photography along the Riviera is beautiful.
B00005JO04|2.0|In all fairness, I hate subtitles.  Many films with them are tolerable because they are entertaining or informative or something.  I found it too choppy to follow most of the time.  I also found that I spent so much energy trying to follow what everyone one was saying that I often missed the point (if indeed there was one).  The best scenes seemed to have nothing to do with the themes.  Soy bacon was the highlight of the film for me.

B00005JNX0|2.0|And  couldnt afford to give it a decent ending or relaly develope a great story and characters...<br /><br />Concept, 5 stars<br /><br />characters: EH 3 overall, they had some GREAT characters (mainly the penguins), greaty moments.  BUT Too many left underdeveloped or actually were too much the \\"actors\\" who voiced them and not more unique movie characters you can connect with.<br /><br />Beginning of movie: 4 stars...<br /><br />It was cute, it had some funny parts.  BUT it was no shrek, or Nemo.<br /><br />Ending 1... I have never been more dissatisfied with a movie ending before.  BLAH<br /><br />And there are actually some disturbing parts in this movie.  WE get that Alex Goes a bit wild but they went overboard on that for a kids movie.  I had to give warnings to peers with kids.

020161622X|3.0|I have to be frank - I didn't really enjoy this book much.<br /><br />I fear I'll suffer a big backlash from that comment. After all, this book is well spoken of and is even revered. I bought it expecting to find a real tome of expertise and insightful comment from genuine front-line coders.<br /><br />Instead, I just got a collection of cutesy titles and mixed metaphors which are meaningless when listed by name. Oh, make no mistake, the author is undoubtedly an excellent coder and has a lot to offer. However, the myriad of section topics are simply named according to bad over-cliches. And, sorry, to me, this made the book painful to read and extremely forgettable. Looking at the title of contents brings back nothing; I have to re-read sections to remember just what the salient point was supposed to be.<br /><br />I realise Americans enjoy cliches and I don't want to sound humourless. However, it just wasn't a readable or memorable book.<br /><br />And, while I'm at it, I didn't really learn much either. Perhaps I'm a better coder than I thought or perhaps the book doesn't go into huge depth. Regardless, I'd rather read Joel on Software than the Pragmatic Programmer.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|When I 1st listened to Korn, I was hooked.  Songs like Here To Stay, and Freak On A Leash got me instantly craving more.  I have their Greatest Hits, and was quite impressed.  When I found out that \\"Head\\" left the band, I was crushed like most Korn fans.  Not only did they lose half of their 7-string guitar duo, but they lost they supporting vocals as well.  So what did they do?  They ADAPTED.  I'll give the critics one thing, it does not sound like the old Korn we new and loved, but this album is certainly the \\"evolution of heavy\\", and not much can be taken away from this album.  I mean, yeah, they had to use more effects on this album, THEIR GUITARIST LEFT, they had to make up for it somehow.  And I'm not taking anything away from Munky, he's one of my favorites.  But your sound isn't going to be the same when one of your core members leaves.  Songs like Twisted Transistor, Love Song, Open Up, Seen It All, and Coming Undone are the highlights of this CD. <br /> <br />Now, I got this CD for Christmas, so I don't know how much it cost, but I do not regret putting this at the top of my wishlist.  Go out and buy this CD people, you will not regret it, and if you're a true Korn fan, you will stick with them.

B0000029AP|1.0|This gets boring. Sweet Emotion gets played on almost every radio station in the world. And probably the only Aerosmith song <br />they ever play besides the Dream On song. 2 really annoying rock <br />songs. Get Your Wings is all you need from Aerosmith. But for sure, radios need to stop playing just Cars, Nirvana, & Aerosmith.
B00000JQFL|5.0|This is one of the few recordings I've owned in 8-track, cassette, vinyl, and now CD formats. The live cuts are so superbly tracked it sounds as though you are standing on the stage with the band. I love the slighly overdriven bass speaker cabinet, especially. Gorgeous vocals and an audience that came to celebrate... a must-have among your must-haves!
1932100385|5.0|I have studied nutrition the way only a person with a heart problem, and a desire to get the best out of whatever years remain can.  With a passion.  Without a doubt this is the best book ever written on this subject.   <br />  My only advice besides to read it, is to read it from cover to cover, and do not skip around in the book.  Read even the areas that you might not have an interest in (ie: Breast cancer if you are a male, you might be tempted to skip by, but do not).  Campbell feeds the information to you in acceptable pieces, and you will miss a lot if you do not read every word.  <br />  This book will change your life in a most positive way, it has mine.
B00002DF9N|5.0|This collection is a wonderful package in that it brings together one of Strauss's life friends and largest advocates (Karl Bohm) with two incredible GERMAN orchestras playing their own nationalistic music.      These recordings rank among my most cherished and loved.  Highlights (for me) include the climax of sunrise in the Alpine Symphony, the huge reverberations as the massive sound of the fff chords carry over into silence in Heldenleben, and the wicked-crazy horns as they rip through the Waltz from Rosenkavalier.      These are prime interpretations (better, I feel than any other -- and I mean ANY - sorry Karajan fans!!!).  And these two wonderful forces play their musical heritage with passion and brilliance.    As another reviewer pointed out, the sound quality leaves something to be desired, however it is not quite as bad as they would have us believe.  What we first must take into account is that Strauss' huge tone poems put enormous demands on the recording equipment of its day that could not be met.  Also, Bohm was stressed above all else that \\"the melody be prominent\\".  Yes - as a result the recording really kicks out the melody line.      Okay - take that into account and listen to these with some imagination.  I assure you that you will be able to hear the detail of Strauss' music - but more importantly the style and idea of it.  Listen like you would look at a black and white photo.  While the B&W leaves more for your imagination, you still \\"get the picture\\" - and sometimes the B&W reveales more!  It's exactly the same with this incredible box of Strauss.    The interpretation is absolutely stunning and revealing.  Bohm nailed this on the head and truly captured the essence of this music.  I feel this is a wonderful place for you to start if you know little Strauss - and if you know much about Strauss, this is a great place for you to hear a different, but seemingly perfect interpretation of Strauss.
B000002UDB|5.0|The Magical Mystery Tour doesn't get all the attention it deserves, and it surely didn't get it during the magical days of 1967. It was released after the spell binding \\"Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". A TV Movie was also released, and the songs on The Magical Mystery Tours accompanied that movie. However, from the start of the whole concept, things went wrong. The TV producers didn't show the movie in colour, and therefore sacrificed the soul of the album.  <br /> <br />The soul, a mix of \\"Pepper\\" and \\"Revolver\\" is what drives this beautifully crafted piece of work. It is solid, and definitely a collectable, with tracks like \\"Strawberry Fields Forever', \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"All You Need is Love\\" and \\"I am the Walrus\\". What more can you want from an album?  <br /> <br />The Beatles took their creative talents and tangled thoughts about societies webbed culture into high gear, as they continued to get \\"weirder\\", experimenting with sounds and chords never performed before.  <br /> <br />Other than the hits, there are other tunes that deserve to be mentioned. Paul McCartney shows his love for \\"English Tea Music\\", with \\"Your Mother Should Know\\", a well crafted track with a melody that will soe a broken heart.  <br /> <br />In fact, a Paul fanatic would really appreciate this album. His tracks are scattered like star dust across the album. Along with \\"Your Mother Should Know\\", he leads \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", \\"The Fool on the Hill\\" and \\"Hello Goodbye\\". Of course, the sparkling \\"Penny Lane\\" is here, which speaks volumes for one of Paul's most creative works.  <br /> <br />Not to be outdone, John is also present in this album. Some critics argue that this album was the last sigh that John breathed into any work the Beatles breathed. But that sleepy eye doesn't show as he swings by the thoughtful and ever so real \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\". His trademark voice and gripping tone is also very real in \\"Baby You're A Rich Man\\". But the most provoking song, one that really shows John's frustrations and intermingles with the world, is \\"All You Need is Love\\", a simple, almost childlike look at 1967 society.  <br /> <br />And then of course, they're George, who surprised more than his share of individuals, as his talents begin to show up, both in his lyrics and delivery. He stars in \\"Blue Jay Way\\", and shows that Paul isn't the only one who can mend you with melodies.  <br /> <br />Is Magical Mystery Tour the Beatles greatest album? Well, that's anyone guess. However, it is their most creative, both as individuals and a group. The songs on this album are a shun carpet towards \\"The Beatles: (The White Album)\\". And, honestly, who can argue with that?
B0001GF2DS|5.0|First off let me say that this film is one of my favorite westerns ,I saw it when I was a kid and loved it . I just picked it up about 6 months ago and my son who is 14 now has watched it about 7 times. Tuco is the our favorite guy in the film but clent and angel eyes are great as well.
1400043662|5.0|A good way to judge a book is to consider if it inspired feelings you will always remember and in this regard I am fairly sure that this truly remarkable book will stay with me forever. Being my first Japanese book I had no idea of what to expect but what a surprise (a pleasant one that is). I found this book - on love, life and growing up - to be a real page turner. The novel is difficult to get into but once inside you are treated to a magical mystery tour of a young boy's first step into adulthood.<br /><br />Murakami may at some points be going a bit off the limb with his metaphors and allegories (he is no Fitzgerald in this area of writing) and one could even argue that the book is 100 pages to long but it doesn't matter because the scene, the characters are so exiting that it is hard to put down.<br /><br />To put it the same way one of the books main characters: \\"I want you to remember me. If you remember me, then I don't care if everybody else forgets.\\" -  and yes I will remember and I will read more works of this strange, mystical author.
B000002KJQ|1.0|Yes, I too agree with others here about the echo and what sounds like a cheap drum machine instead of Beard.  There  may be good news for us...I first heard the entirety of this album when I bought the tape a few months back at a small gas station in the middle of Pensylvannia.  Since then I've learned how to play some of the songs and could listen to this every day.  When the purchase of the CD came along, we all know what happened from there.  My solution is simply to record the tape to a .wav file and burn yourself a CD...(Dont sweat, Amazon.  It ain't piracy if you've bought the tape and the CD is for your own use.)  <br /> <br />I'll base my rating from the tape/LP and say that where some songs are obviously better than others, its one of those albums you can leave on and not have to skip a track.  If some songs come off raw in the vocal department or slow, perhaps blues is not for you.  I find it packed with soulful (J.J. Left Chicago) and sometimes funky (Sheik) playing styles that are just short of a religious experience.  Warning! The instrumental bridge of Precious and Grace can sometimes cause one to mash the accelerator to the floor.
0385338686|4.0|Sophie Kinsella's books are guaranteed to be fun reads, and this one is no exception.  I think that I especially enjoyed the book because it is about a successful corporate attorney who never leaves home without her Blackberry.  And who would rather pay for catered dinner than cook one.  I live a similar life, though no one I know is as far gone as Samantha Sweeting. Anyway, as a lawyer, I just loved the line, \\"I'm not a workaholic! I'm a lawyer! It's different!\\"  That's kind of true.  <br /> <br />Some reviewers found the plot implausible. I don't think that's a problem.  I thought the antics of the Shopaholic were much worse.  But, in fact, all Kinsella's plots are somewhat implausible. Naturally, everything Samantha is or does is an exaggeration of real life -- that's what makes it so funny.  I mean, her incompetence at general household tasks is absolutely hilarious!  Kinsella's humor and timing never disappoint.  This is a book that made me laugh out loud.   <br /> <br />But it did have one drawback -- the book was too quick of a read. I bought it in the airport and finished it before I landed. It was just way to fluffy for a hardback book, so I think I should have waited for the paperback, or borrowed it from a friend.
B000002LFU|4.0|this album was the start of there WB years and they kicked off with a good start.  i'd like to comment on each song indivisually. <br />1.pop song '89:a great upbeat song to start with. preety much a  pop song and basic lyrics repeated throughout. <br /> <br />2.get up:realy nice melody,dreamy song which is nice to wake up to. <br /> <br />3.you are the everything:a nice relaxed song. a lovly undercurrent that makes it seem like a love ballard like the one i love. one of my favrouites on the album. <br /> <br />4.stand:not the best song on the album but fun to jump around to just for the sake of it. <br /> <br />5.world leader pretend:a calm lyricaly strong song which has a very light 'in your face' undercurrentcy to it. <br /> <br />6.the wrong child:beautiful song which will have your imagination matching the lyrics. <br /> <br />7.orange cruch:possibly the most famous song of this record. another fav of mine even though i have no idea what its about, but that doesn't stop me enjoying it. <br /> <br />8.turn you inside-out:another fun song to jump about to with a killer chrous. <br /> <br />9.hairshirt: another song to relax to. <br /> <br />10.i remember california:a song that i have been addicted to since i got the album. intence, strong and addictive. <br /> <br />11.untitled:this song has no tile being a type of bonus track which u can skip to.  the last song and also one of the best which ends the album in a relaxing melody.
B000002KHH|5.0|I love this album. War Pigs would be my favorite song as it was the first song I learned on guitar 9 years ago. There is really no bad song in my opinion. Fairies Wear Boots (Jack the Stripper) is another of my favorites. This album should be in the collection of any Metal fan or even some Rock fans. It's not quite as hard as other Metal so it sholdn't bother Classic Rock fans. Don't get me wrong though, it is hard, real hard. <br /> <br />I'm writing this because I have to whole-heartedly agree with BeBop Bounty Head. People that think KoRn started Metal need to die. I don't mind them liking KoRn but... they did not start Metal. Black Sabbath started it followed closely behind by Judas Priest. In the 80s Metal really took off with NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal). The NWOBHM included Heavy Metal Legend Iron Maiden (my personal favorite). Alot of the good bands in the 80s were from Britian (hence the name NWOBHM). There were other good bands that even people that think KoRn invented Metal should like... unless it's too hard for them. Bands like Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Testament and a few more 80s bands should be Metal enough for KoRn fans. They are some of the heaviest bands from the 80s that in my opinion are MUCH better than KoRn, one of the main reasons being GUITAR SOLOS! KoRn did not invent but they helped save NU-METAL, I'll repeat, they did not invent but they helped save NU-METAL from being taken over by grunge. I can list other bands that I think overtake KoRn anyday. Iced Earth, Blind Guardian, Demons and Wizards, Fear Factory, Children of Bodom, Sepultura, Exodus, Angra, System of a Down, Machine Head, Pantera, Dream Theater, Overkill, Lamb of God, Trivium, Mudvayne, Disturbed, Nightwish, Stratovarious and MUCH more. KoRn isn't my least favorite band or anything but I'm trying to say that they didn't invent metal, most of the bands i named were around before KoRn (I know alot of them came after and some were about the same time)whichproves that they didn't invent. If you just listen to some of those you'll hear that they are metal. Same goes for Linkin Park... I don't even consider them metal, i consider them alt. rock.  <br /> <br />This is one of my top 20 albums of all time though, it is a great album for any true metal fan.
0393327655|4.0|Oh. My. [Insert deity here]. Sam Harris is my kind of philosopher. If I'd had this book 35 years ago, I would've understood why philosophy class in college made me feel suddenly alive and more resolute to leave the evangelical Christian fold in which I was raised. My Co-pilot was oblivious to the clear danger signs I saw on the instrument panel: using Christian jargon as a language that never made actual sense; allowing no gray or colorful areas in a black and white world; implying that billions of people who weren't in our denomination fell under the Wrong on Judgment Day column; referring to other religions as infiltrated (if not guided) by Satanic forces; requiring my life's work to be that of changing billions of hearts and minds; learning to ignore this world because a better one was promised after we die...Eject! Eject! Eject! <br /> <br />Believers, gird up your loins for this book. Harris may repeat his point every way from Sunday just to makes us read his impressive list of footnotes, but I do believe he, and many others, would like us to use the minds, if not the hearts, we received.
B000001AKM|5.0|Lionel Richie reminds me of the boss at my first part time job workplace who had the exactly the same hairstyle and had similar face. Lionel Richie is a perfect student of Motown school and created some of the finest love songs of the 70s and 80s either during Commodores days and his solo works such as LIONEL RICHIE (1981) CAN'T SLOW DOWN (1983) and DANCING ON THE CEILING (1986). Also he contributed a lot to make ADULT CONTEMPORARY household words for ordinary music fans.<br /><br />It is true that this compilation has some flaws seen from seasoned fans because it misses a lot of great songs that should have been here such as YOU ARE from LIONEL RICHIE or BALLERINA GIRL from DANCING ON THE CEILING. Yet for music fans that are new to him this compilation is an excellent guide to know his music.<br /><br />EASY, THREE TIMES A LADY, STILL, SAIL ON comes from Commodores all of them are some of my all time favorites. ALL NIGHT LONG is a fun reggae-like pop song and one of my all-time 80s hits. RUNNING WITH THE NIGHT and DANCING ON THE CEILING are the power pop track with excellent guitar solo. HELLO, STUCK ON YOU, PENNY LOVER are the love ballads so unforgettable. ENDLESS LOVE duet with DIANA ROSS is the theme title for the film. Newer tracks are of lesser degree than all time favorite hits but enjoyable. DO IT TO ME might be for someone else to sing, say , LUTHER VANDROSS? MY DESTINY could have been CAN'T SLOW DOWN track.<br /><br />MY OH MY seems to find a place in WE ARE THE WORLD soundtrack.<br /><br />Verdict: All Time Favorite Compilation though missing some great songs.<br /><br />Rating: 94 out of 100<br /><br />Recommended for: Wide range of music fans who are new to Lionel Richie.
0440241588|2.0|This is the second book of Grisham's I have read.  The first was A Time to Kill, and, while I enjoyed it, it did have problems.  I figured that all good writers tend to improve their craft, so I decided to get Grisham's most recent work.  Big mistake.  The Broker is not very good at all.  The suspense and intrigue are pitifully absent.  In their place are sprawling discussions of the Italian language and cities.  Both of these may be interesting subjects in their own right, but I felt a little cheated by Grisham's obsession with them.  Bait and switch I would call it.  I thought I would be reading something akin to The Bourne Identity, obviously I was wrong. <br /> <br />The Broker is a waste of time.  If you read books precisely to while your time away, then it isn't so bad.  If you read books looking for action and intrigue, read a Ludlum book.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|Walter Salles has proven himself a formidable director with his successes in 'Central Station', Behind the Sun', and The Motorcycle Diaries': he is an artist unafraid to approach unfamiliar terrain in his growth as a director, yet always proving that the most important element in making a good film is to explore the characters more than just the atmosphere.  Those who find faults with DARK WATER seem to be concentrating on critiques of special effects and manufactured terror machines. Where Salles succeeds in this adaptation of the original Japanese film by Kôji Suzuki (novel) and Hideo Nakata (director) is his concentration on developing interesting and strange people, characters with whom we can identify and thus whose encounters with the 'unknown' feel more intensely internal.<br /><br />The story has been related ad infinitum: Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her daughter Cecelia (Ariel Gade) move from Manhattan away from her recently estranged husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) to a creaky apartment building on Roosevelt Island to the benefit of real estate agent Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly) and under the suspicious eye of building super Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite).  The building and the constant rain are ominous from the start but soon strange events happen that suggest either mental decline of both Dahlia and Ceci or the presence of ghosts.  The title of the film describes not only the bleak atmospheric element that drives the story but also the netherworld that admixes surrealistic phenomena with psychosis. Characters enter the story naturally and comfortably: Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth) offers his legal defense of Dahlia in a manner that belies his mode of existence; Ceci's Teacher (Camryn Manheim) brings reality testing to the fuzzy world of imaginary friends; Alison Sealy-Smith as a supervisor where Dahlia seeks work is one of Dahlia's few kind encounters.<br /><br />Though the pacing seems slow it does march like the descent of a mind into the unknown and Salles manages that well. The film's cinematography by Affonso Beato maintains the grunge effect that intensifies the terror and Angelo Badalamenti has provided a musical score that bears just the right amount of supportive suspense.  But as with other Salles movies the work is supported by truly fine acting and once again Jennifer Connelly proves she can convey much with very little.  Give this film a chance, without comparisons to other films of the genre, and see what Walter Salles can do with a story. Grady Harp, December 05anages that well.

0525948023|1.0|I gave one star to get your attention.  <br />In this relative world of \\"ours\\" as it is well proven by all the reviews posted here, all the negative as well as all the positive points of view towards the book, some call it better/and /or worse than his previous work. It's all relative, the fact that you choose to cling to one idea of how things work or how things should work is irrelevant, the author doesn't even care, he is just stating facts that you may or may not be aware of. <br />I myself feel like I'd jumped in the bandwagon, and joined all the supposedly reviews of the book which are no more than mere opinions of their own either contradicting the book or agreeing with it. (duhhh) <br />So here it goes, I am the typical 32 year old man who wakes up in the   <br />in the morning wondering why am I here at all in this world. I am afraid of death as most people are, I am also in a constant state of unhappiness, the only thing that provides some satisfaction is  <br />as with most man sex, yet the rest of the day is just a waiting period untill I go to sleep and then the same thing the next morning, this book addresses all these subjects and lot more with such an unusual perspective that either you love it or hate it, as I stated in the begining it's all relative, but what really matters  <br />is that is has the power to shake the very foundations of any beliefs that you hold to be true at the present moment. <br />I know that you don't care what makes me happy, what my gender is or any of the things I descrived here about myself, this so called \\"review\\" is for all those men who share the same miserable   <br />life as I do to go ahead and give this book a chance. Don't be afraid, be prepared though because is not easy to digest such profound content.  <br />Also I got tired of the tone of most reviews here the stereotypical guy who meditates all day and thinks that \\"he's made it\\" just by reading the book. <br />No, it won't solve your problems,,, just buy thedammed book you'll be glad you did, or will you? ...
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I am a huge fan of gilmore girls.   It is enlightning and funny, its one of the only good shows on TV right now.  But I am warning you not to buy this on amazon because my 2nd disc didnt work and i didnt have an eposide guide.  I still do encourge you to go out an buy Gilmore Girls 5th season in your local store.
B000002IZM|5.0|This is an amazing soundtrack to an amazing film. A few reviews complain because there are some lines from the movie played during the beginning of a few songs. These lines don't distract very much from the music, and in my opinion they enhance it.I love this film, and so I like hearing the lines. This music is a major inspiration for my own art, and I highly recommend it.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|The effects were wonderful. It was a very enjoyable movie once it started. The first 30 to 45 minutes was full of sub-plots that added complexity when I was just looking to enjoy a King Kong movie. Maybe this is just me, but I could have done without about an hour of this movie. My suggestion is to view this movie in a theater with comfortable seats.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|but otherwise the story was maddeningly dull...I love Japan and Tokyo and wanted to connect to the story. Did not.<br /><br /> Bill Murray's character was bitter and mean, blaming his wife for their crumbling marriage when, to me, he was rather undesirable and hateful. And one subliminal message in the film was blame the wife, she doesnt understand poor Bill M's character, he is a complete mess but it isnt his fault...it's because she is so concerned with interior decorating that he takes up with a Japanese hooker. Oh poor man! No wonder he was drawn to a nubile 19 year old blonde babe ( uhhh..DUH)<br /><br />And he just has to suuuuuuuffffffer.... not at all look at himself or his flaws. It was  humor humor humor ( dark at that) with the premise that he was a bumbling aging misunderstood semi tragic hero.<br /><br />And blah blah blah  we're still  seeing movies with 50 ish leading men connecting with/wooing/wanting/getting girlwomen more than half their age. I know that comment may anger some, and seem like I am putting my issues onto this review, but what I am trying to say is this kind of pairing in movies is so so so common, predictable , rampant and basically a turn off; it did contribute to my disinterest in the story line, though I promise, I tried to like it.  But come on! Only in the movies would a luminous blonde fall for aforementioned \\"hero\\". I can hear it now: \\"But it IS a movie\\" I know that, but again, this kind of storyline is so commonplace that when the old guy gets the girl it is never meaningful, it's just a way to market a film by showing a chick in her underwear.<br /><br /> I agree with another reviewer who mentioned ethnic stereotyping... much of the film's supposed humor was based on making fun of Japanese language and customs.<br /><br /> I want more in a film and especially in the female characters. I just did not believe in their connection or even care, actually.<br /><br />BUT I will say, ( don't want to give it away) the very last scene was lovely, it really was. Throughout the movie, the visuals were great, and Sofia Coppola has credited the more experienced people in her crew that helped her achieve such a look. Too bad the richness of her crew's experience did nt help the characters.very last scene was lovely, it really was.

Some of the lyrics on this album are post 9/11 (this album was released December '01) as Ghostface Killah says \\"Who the f*** knocked our buildings down? Who's whe man behind the world trade massacre step yp now?\\" as some members express their thoughts and feelings on 9/11 (who didn't talk about that event?). The song \\"Soul Power\\" features loud (and possibly pointless) yelling from P.E.'s Flava Flav. \\"Pinky Ring\\" was their first single, which featured vocals from (most) members from the Wu. I as pre-fan was very happy to hear this. \\"Yall Been Warned\\" is the song that Method Man takes over and holds some of it down (Meth did step his lyrics back up--briefly for this album). One person I have to knock is RZA for comming with some wackest lyrics I've heard from him. An example, just pop the CD in and listen for the first 10 seconds (was that even a rhyme), but that goes away and the song \\"In The Hood Starts\\" as Masta Killa, Rebel Inspetah Deck, and Method Man's newest recruit Streetlife, the low profile members shine together on the frist track. Streetlife, is he now part of the Wu, since he's on this album and the previous \\"The W\\" album? Lets hope his situation doesn't end up like Capadonna's. Later on in the album, you get to hear the Wu do a colab with Ronald Isley in the song \\"Back In The Game\\" as INS, Meth, Genius (finally he comes correct too on this song), Rae, and Ghostface handle this song. For some older Wu members, this may anger them, but I like it and has became one of my favorite tracks. The song behind the title track \\"Iron Flag\\" is \\"The Glock\\" which is pretty pointless as \\"Good thing we brought the glock\\" is repeated after every line someone says. The last track \\"Dashing\\" is a good way to close out the CD was Inspectah Deck begins singging beginning to a famous Christmas song, but the Genius closes the song off, ending the album on a good note.<br /><br />Some songs the production is not on point and comes off kind of soft on such songs such as \\"Iron Flag\\" but it doesn't make the song that bad. Other things that could have used improvement is the lyrical content. Mr. Bobby Digital aka RZA can come up with some of the most [unthoughtul] lyrics ever. The guest appearances on the track \\"Chrome Wheels\\" is not all that good. And the Genius (I hate saying this) comes at the begininng of the album meidocore, but fixes that problem towards the end. And I can't go without saying that SOME vocals from Ol' Dirty Bastard would be appriciated to this album (as much as his voice is recycled since he died, you'd question why didn't they do this much while he was locked up). Not to mention that Capadonna would have been a good addition to the album.<br /><br />Much older Wu fans may not appriciate this release because of how they've became more softer as time went on from their debut. But after hearing this, it would make you dust off the \\"36 Chambers\\" album for you to bring back memories. Newer fans (like I was when THIS was released) would find it to be enjoyable to listens to. I recommend this to new fans (new meaning post-\\"Forever\\") fans of the Wu. People considered this was the worst anything from the Wu-Tang has ever made, that was until Method Man's \\"Tical O\\" and Raekwon's \\"The Lex Diamond Story\\" came out later on. Now this below average album sounds like one of the best they released since 1997. Probably since they droped as a group every 3 years previously, this CD was released too fast after \\"The W\\" (2000), thats why I'm not mad at people giving this album 3 or 4 stars. I for one like this, and don't believe that fans should bash this one. Pick up a copy and enjoy it.<br /><br />Lyrics: B<br />Production: B-<br />Guest Appearances: C+<br />Overall: B-<br /><br />Standout tracks: Rules, Uzi [Pinky Ring], Ya'll Been Warned, Back In The Game, Dashing [Reasons]e album on a good note.

B000BNX3B4|5.0|Read the book and THEN see the movie! Diane Lane brings the character of Sarah to life perfectly. Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing are wonderfully cast; Sarah's big Irish family is a hoot and a mixed bag. Sarah, a preschool teacher, has been divorced for 8 months and is convinced to put herself on Perfect Match.com! She has some meddling sisters but it works when John Cusack answers her ad. Of course, love never runs smoothly for the two but happiness steals the show. Great chick flick!
B000AP04EW|1.0|I believed that the average rating for this movie of four stars indicated that it would be good fun. It was not. This movie was like a bad video game. I am annoyed that I wasted two hours on this movie. I kept expecting something clever or interesting happen and it never did. Even the moments of interest in the movie rated only three stars. There was absolutely no attempt to develop the characters and, although something interesting probably could have been done with the main premise, it was not. Instead of trying to develop any suspense, the director chose to have yet another ridiculous shoot-out. This movie was a huge disappointment.
0385486804|5.0|Prior to his deadly trip to Alaska in 1992, Chris McCardless spent some time in Carthage, South Dakota with the Westerbergs, people who took him in for a while.  Mr. Westerberg's mom spent about five hours with the young McCandless one evening and was mesmerized by his both his erudition and the strength of his convictions. She said, \\"Considering that I spent only a few hours in Alex's company, it amazes me how much I am bothered by his death.\\" This is a sentiment shared by many, including Jon Krakauer, the author, and myself, the rapt reader of Into the Wild.  What we have here is a foolish young man, a back-to-nature type, who dies a horrible death by overestimating his abilities to survive the inhospitalities of the Alaskan wilderness. Or maybe not.  Maybe we have someone a lot more complex.     <br /> <br />Krakauer, himself an edgy explorer, guides us on an investigative journey to determine what kind of man would expose himself and his family to such pain. Was McCardless a romantic seeker of the truth, a Diogenes who insisted on mining the finer truths of human existence by exposing himself to the harshest of environments?  Was he lacking in common sense? Was he mentally ill? What about his relationships with friends and family could shed light on his headlong rush to mortality?  Was his life a pathetic intellectual affectation, a fatal exercise of arrogance?   Each page is a carefully crafted, insightful look at human life on the edge, in as clear focus as we will get it. The Alaskan environment, not mere background in this work, is portrayed with precise and chilling detail.  Krakauer is a tough and tender anthropologist who dug very deep to unearth some truths about what it means to be human.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Today's computerized animation cannot begin to hold a candle to the gorgeous hand-drawn animation of days past (well, almost past). That may change someday, but until it does some of the most beautiful animation currently created comes out of Japan's Studio Ghibli. And the team that created Ghibli started out with this movie. \\"Nausica&auml;, of the Valley of the Wind\\", released in 1984, explores themes and characters that appear throughout Studio Ghibli's films (particularly those of Hayao Miyazaki). Including powerful lead female roles, nature versus technology, domination through technology, the diminishing returns that can occur when humans try to control nature through their creations, and redemptive villians. Thus, it provides an appropriate starting point for the now world famous studio.<br /><br />The story revolves around Nausica&auml; herself, the last surving daughter of King Jil of the valley. The Fukai, a poisonous forest threatens this valley (and slowly ossifies the bones of its residents), and giant insects of many forms roam the earth. Humans no longer possess the top spot on the food chain. Of course some humans miss thier dominant place, and attempt to destroy the Fukai. A Tolmekian ship, carrying dangerous and mysterious cargo, crashes near the valley. This prompts an invasion of the valley by the Tolmekians. Their leader, Princess Kushana (whose husband \\"will see much worse\\"), reveals that the Tolmekians will attempt to destroy the Fukai with an ancient soldier-God and give the earth back to humanity. One big thing (or more accurately, many big things) stand in the way: the enormous insects called Ohmus. They have thwarted all attempts to take over the Fukai. But, as the Tolmekians point out, no humans before them possessed an ancient soldier-God. The people of the valley do not agree with the methods of the Tolmekians (they think humans should try to live in peace with the insects), and so Nausica&auml; is taken hostage as insurance. The film climaxes with a huge battle scene in which Princess Kushana uses the reconstructed soldier-God against the furiously stampeding Ohmus.<br /><br />The DVD also includes a great documentary on the beginnings of Studio Ghibli. It tells the story of just how difficult it was to get a Japanese studio to produce Nausica&auml;. Miyazaki and others tried to make this movie without an accompanying Manga (unprecedented for the time; most movies then typically went from Manga to film). The solution was obvious: they made Nausica&auml; into a highly successful Manga and then the studios agreed. After the subsequent film also became a huge hit the people involved decided to form their own studio. So Studio Ghibli was born. But the documentary doesn't stop there, it goes on to summarize all of Ghibli's films up to \\"The Cat Returns\\" (and, according to this documentary, \\"Castle in the Sky\\" was actually the first \\"offical\\" Ghibli release). All Ghibli fans should see this piece.<br /><br />Anyone who has enjoyed \\"Princess Mononoke\\" or \\"Spirited Away\\" should also check out \\"Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Winds\\". It presents a great story with incredible animation. The amount of work that goes into these films must be staggering. But the effort pays off, as the detailed animation and backgrounds never lose their magnificence even after multiple viewings. And as the years went on Ghibli just kept releasing amazing films. Hopefully they'll keep on going.huge battle scene in which Princess Kushana uses the reconstructed soldier-God against the furiously stampeding Ohmus. <br /> <br />The DVD also includes a great documentary on the beginnings of Studio Ghibli.

B000006MS3|5.0|Out of all of her albums, this one still resonates the<br />loudest if a qualified listener is aware of the great synths<br />and beats inherent throughout.  This could easily be called<br />her \\"cult favorite among happy thieves\\".  Everything is in<br />a good space here.  Aside from a few overtly anxious pieces<br />that stretch a bit farther than most dullards can swallow, this<br />album has no true flaws.  It really is up to the listener's willingness<br />to succomb to her sonic demands.  It ranks up there with Dark Side<br />of the Moon and America The Beautiful as one of the densest and joyful<br />experiences in modern music.
B00000FCBC|3.0|The second CD is good. The first has its moments, but the cover of Nick Cave's \\"Loverman\\" is pretty bad despite what the Amazon review says. James sounds way too corny. Cave was way more terrifying. The cover of \\"Astronomy\\" is noteworthy though. All in all its kind of a toss-up. If I hadnt been a Metallica fan before the album I probably would have hated it completely. Like other people have said though, it is the last album Newstead was on, and I think he got out just in time to tell you the truth, maybe even a tad late.
B000BNI99K|5.0|This boxed set was given to me as a Christmas Gift...but the memories each song has stirred up in my mind is more than any gift could have given.....memories of my parents dancing together...family gatherings from the past....old high school friends...unbelieveable--Thanks for the Memories!
B00005JOT1|4.0|The film is titled `A Good Woman,' but it is actually filmed version of Oscar Wilde play `Lady Windermere's Fan.' Wilde's original, which was put on stage in 1892 and became the first `hit' for Wilde, was set in the drawing room of end-of-the-century England, but `A Good Woman' shifted the background to the Amalfi coast (South Italy) in the 1930s. The director is Mike Barker from England (`To Kill a King'), but some of the main characters' roles are played by American actors. <br /> <br />Two women play the central roles in `A Good Woman.' One is Mrs. Erlynne, `a woman of experience' (Helen Hunt, cast against type) a seductive middle-aged woman from New York. Shunned by the aristocratic society, she still hopes to win the love of gentleman - a rich gentleman - and here in Italy, it seems, she has already attracted some of them. One of them is `Tuppy' (delightful Tom Wilkinson), who refuses to listen to the rumor about Erlynne. <br /> <br />The other woman is Lady Windermere, `a woman of innocence' (Scarlett Johansson), who is newly married, and devotes herself to her husband. After arriving at this beautiful Italian resort, however, her husband Lord Windermere (Mark Umbers) seems to have got nervous about something, some secret he knows, which lady's man Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore) also happen to notice in his checkbook. <br /> <br />The film retains the basic storyline of Wilde's original. There is a twist (as in the original) which might or might not surprise you. All in all the filmed version is successful in maintaining our interest in the story, which gets melodramatic especially in the second half. The changed location is not a bad thing to me (the `stagy' films are not my cup of tea), but the changed times are a different matter. The 1930s is, I m afraid, too modern a period to make the rigid social conventions of late Victorian convincing. The first part of the film is, I think, considerably weakened by the changed situation and lengthy introduction.  <br /> <br />Here is another complaint. As the film's title suggests, `A Good Woman' is more about the ladies than about the gentlemen. That is good. Consequently, however, unlike the original play two male roles Lord Darlington and Lord Windermere look less impressive than the ones you meet in the book. This is a problem because many of the witty lines of Wilde are uttered by Lord Darlington and his character as a flirt plays an important role in the second half of the play. He should be more attractive, hopefully devilishly charming. <br /> <br />You may object to the casting of Ms. Hunt and Ms. Johansson. I find Helen Hunt's lady Windermere sexually seductive enough, but not really seductive enough to make her look like a social climber. Not that her acting is bad, but you may name a name or two of someone who could play the same role as good as, or perhaps better than, Helen Hunt. <br /> <br />`A Good Woman' is easy on the eye with two beautiful leading ladies in gorgeous costumes, and fun to see with intelligent dialogues (and it is Oscar Wilde, the genius, so why not witty after all?) The original play's social satire is no longer compelling, now. But `A Good Woman' is light-hearted, maybe too light-hearted you might say, but is still sweet and pleasant.
B000002GYR|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but I do listen to a lot of Tom Waits. A lot. This was the first thing I got by him from before his Island stuff. It isn't my favorite. It isn't the most exciting or groundbreaking or anything like that. It's just really good. If you are sitting around tonight alone put this album on. If you are sitting around with too many people and you wish you were alone, put this album on. Some of the songs you find here will surely hit close to home and others may serve as a heads up for things left to experience (\\"Martha\\"...), but all of it will slow the evening down and put you in a mood to appreciate whatever life has dealt you.
0156907399|5.0|Not written for the attention deficit disorder generation. If your preference is children's literature, shallow fantasy, Republican politics, or weak science fiction (Star Wars III), this book is not for you (see Jonathan Pike). This is a book dealing with subtle emotional currents which requires a little effort by the reader. Those of a lazy inclination, I can see, would rather deride the book than admit to-if possible-their own intellectual inadequacies or sheer laziness.  <br /> <br />There are no explosions, gunfire, or whatever fantastical nonsense the television generation requires to distract them from ever having to think or wonder about their petty, shallow, and meaningless existence. They are all 'W's I guess. <br /> <br />Woolf is rightly thought to be one of the greatest writers of all time. This book proves it. She was indeed a master.
B0000025KI|5.0|In 1981, I was asked by a friend of mine if I'd like to go and see Bruce Springsteen in concert. He had an extra ticket and I dropped a couple of bucks to him and went to the show. The crowd was entering the arena laughing and thrilled to be at the show. Over the next few hours I was released into a world I had only dreamed existed. It was one of a rock-n-roll revival show. Except the band was young and full of an optimistic energy that was so genuinely sincere it engulfed every single person in the crowd into a sweaty dance party from some old 50's movie and equally brought you to a variety of scenes from the classic film noir cinema of the same era. The songs though, were brand new or very recently released within a ten year period. I had never, ever seen or heard anything at this level of quality.<br /><br />For the only time in my life I went to the local music store the next day and bought every remaining Bruce album I hadn't yet bought. A worthy investment to say the least. I am to this day an avid Bruce Springsteen fan. The River was the tour and the album that made me a fan for life. On another note, Bruce Springsteen is a true patriot.Proven, tried and true. Anyone who dismisses this purely because he has the freedom as an American to speak out about what he believes and does. Is wrongly accusing and misinformed.Above all else, anyone with this opinion about Bruce's music. Isn't listening to it. Simply put, nothing more and nothing else.
B000BB1MHS|2.0|I am a huge fan of the original, in fact it is one of my favorite \\"kid\\" movies of all time. And until this movie came out I had not read the book and therefore did not know that the new movie was truer to the story than the original movie. Or so I thought.  <br /> <br />After reading the book I have found that both movies had their variences to the book. Neither one followed it to the T. That would be impossible. The amount of differences were about the same for each movie. <br /> <br />I think Gene Wilder made a more believeable Wonka than Depp did. The whole time I was watching I thought Depp had a mental defect. I swear it seemed like he was on something the way he was acting. Don't get me wrong, I like Johnny Depp in other movies, just not this one. Gene Wilder was 10 times the Wonka that Depp could ever hope to be. <br /> <br />My daughter got this movie for Christmas and while she thinks the movie was good, she thinks the original is much better. Even though I own Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory on VHS, I think I should have just bought that one on DVD, I don't think my daughter would have minded one bit! It was actually kind of a waste of money to get the new one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0140120416|5.0|I am a beginner student of Russian and I love this course. It is a wonderful introduction to all the aspect of Russian. My biggest love of this book is that out of all the Russian books I have, it has one of the most wonderfukl overview of cases I have seen. It also does a lot for pronunciation which is sometimes that the beginner always struggles with, it also in this arena weans you from the anglicization after a while which is a tremendous help to becoming fluent in reading and writing the language.
0671027387|3.0|Hi, this is a mixed review as I found the book entertaining at one end but certainly not a book to remember. The good points are that it is fast paced, has a lot of supposedly factual technology in it (I have to take his word on some of the technology used) and there are enough chapters that you do not need to worry that you have 13 pages to go before you can put you book mark in again (at most there are 4 pages in a row).<br /><br />The negative points are that this feels like a highly condensed book that could have been expanded well, but because such little attention is given to anything at any one time you feel that there is little to get you sympathising or empathising with any character, and it is is this which lets you down. Spielberg does it fantastically well in film with children for example, meaning you feel for the characters and what they are gong through. Dan Brown does not allow this to happen and I fear that he is actually lacking in the ability to do this as I cringed a couple of times in his description of the characters past or the last 'romantic' scene which was as badly played out and cheesy as you could read. This is a shame as the book deserved more narrative and filling out which quite often gets overdone with other authors.<br /><br />However i am looking forward to reading his next book as it does engage the reader and does make you want to find out what happened next. This makes me think it would be good for a paper serialisation but if this ever gets made into a film will need a director with the ability to draw every inch out of the characters to make the film a must see. Get stuck in and enjoy.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|It's been a while since I have been able to put an album in the CD player while I'm online or going to the coffee store without skipping a single track. Despite that this is the first time I have heard Death Cab for Cutie, I have to say that this album touches on why I continue to buy CDs as opposed to ripping single songs off the 'net. Every track gives a different emotion, yet it seems like the whole CD is just one big song. \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\" gives the feeling of an overcome sorrow, and \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\" is also a personal favorite.  <br /> <br />Overall, Plans was very worth it, and gives me an insight into their other albums, which I'll definately look into.
0784010501|1.0|I saw this movie (for free) in the theater when it came out and if I had to pay good money to watch it I would have demanded my money back. It has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen! I was so bored I almost fell asleep watching it. This movie is a waste of good hard earned money and I would not recomend buying it or wasting your time watching it.
B00005QIPH|5.0|\\"Is This It\\" is a very entertaining and satisfying album that came out of left field when it was released. It was completely different from what all the other mainstream bands sounded like, and every song was great on top of that! With \\"Is This It\\" Julian brought his now-somewhat-famous singing style of being VERY close to the mic and sounding very croaky. The great thing is that some bands are even trying to copy his style now (see Razorlight)! The lyrics are well-written here and very catchy and memorable (see \\"Hard To Explain\\" and \\"Someday for examples). Musically the album is very good but not too complex - it's like lo-fi alternative pop rock I guess?. What makes this album deserve \\"5\\" stars is that every song here is very good plus the inclusion of three songs - \\"Hard To Explain\\", \\"Someday\\" and \\"The Modern Age\\". If you're fan of rock you'll most likely dig this album. Absolutely Recommended!  <br /> <br />Highlights include:  <br />the entire album!

0060194995|5.0|Twenty-five years after first reading it, I zipped through the story again. I wanted to understand why the novel has endured so thoroughly, and I think it has something to do with Lee's wise acknowledgement of the flawed South of her childhood filtered through the innocent eyes of a child.

B00003CXDV|5.0|Almost 20 years after their phenomenally successful sci-fi TV show has been cancelled, the once proud cast of \\"Galaxy Quest\\" is relegated to making autograph signing appearances at science fiction conventions and strip mall openings. Only their faux captain, Jason Nesmith, who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart on the show (played here by \\"Home Improvement's\\" Tim Allen), still enjoys his fame among the obsessive fanatics. That is until Jason overhears what a joke he and his \\"crew\\" have become among the less enamored public. Jason's zest for life and his sci-fi legacy is renewed, however, when he is approached by a group of odd \\"Galaxy Quest\\" fans in need of help that turn out to be REAL aliens! Before long, Jason has the whole \\"Galaxy Quest\\" cast along for the ride of their lives in a spaceship designed to look and work exactly like the one on their old TV show. The benevolent Thermians believe the TV show \\"Galaxy Quest\\" is actual historical footage. Commander Taggart and his crew are their heroes, and they've modeled every aspect of their lives, and their highly advanced technology, after the hokey television fantasy. Now, they have sought out Commander Taggart and the crew of the NSEA Protector to help rid them of a villainous alien warlord (played by Robin Sachs) who has already destroyed the majority of their population! It's all a bit overwhelming for the group of mostly disgruntled actors who are both terrified and clueless about how to handle the situation. To defeat the evil General Sarris, each will have to adopt the talents and tact their characters had all those years ago, not to mention the bonds those fictional counterparts shared!<br /><br />\\"Galaxy Quest\\" is unquestionably one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences the science-fiction fanatic can have outside the realms of his or her own obsession! Gently poking fun and paying tribute to everything from the obvious Star Trek to X-Files, Sailor Moon, Star Wars, Heavy Metal, and a million more, it does so gracefully and hilariously! Tim Allen leads a crew made up of Sigourney Weaver as the resident blonde bombshell (and I've never seen her look so good!), Alan Rickman as the bitter Shakespearian sell-out, Tony Shalhoub as the far too mellow Fred Kwan, Daryl Mitchell as the cast's junior member, and Sam Rockwell as Guy, the one-episode cast member with great fear of being killed-off in real-life as quickly as he was in the show! All make up an ensemble cast that plays perfectly together! Backing them up are Enrico Colantoni as Thermian leader Mathesar, the always hilarious Justin Long as obsessed fan Brandon Wheeger, fantastic music by David Newman, and glorious creatures and effects by masters Stan Winston and ILM. The sci-fi fan-pleasing ending is not to be missed! \\"Galaxy Quest\\" looks great on this widescreen DVD which includes fun animated menus, a behind the scenes featurette, hilarious deleted scenes, an actual Thermian language track (I'll have to check that out, I only just found out about it by reading the back cover), cast and crew bios, production notes, and the customary theatrical trailer. If you are a major fan of any sci-fi show or film that is popular enough to warrant a convention or lifelong devotion, \\"Galaxy Quest\\" should be added to your wish list today!

B000AGTPUU|4.0|The Polar Express turned out to be a decent cartoon, one with a lot of nuances that bring character to it.  At first, though, the characters were a little creepy.  The little black girl sitting in her chair hunched over and staring at the boy, or the annoying character who pops up and pipes in with that high pitched voice.  The elves were a little creepy, not to mention even Santa had a strange look to him.  And what is with the cheesy scene where the black girl sings with the poor boy in the back of the train, eventually holding hands and singing into each other's eyes?  But these are all initial reactions. <br /> <br />Once you get past the creepiness you begin to enjoy the story.  The characters begin to look so real and the special effects were breathtaking at times.  But, alas, this is simply a Christmas story, so it can only be enjoyed during Christmas.  Get it for the kids and watch in the Holiday Season, otherwise hold off. <br />

I couldn't put it down, it came to the gym with me, to work, and was aways in my living room.  It was so intense, I just felt like I was there with James.  I became one of his friends.  I loved it.  Thank you James Frey for openning up your heart and sharing this with people who are trying to understand addiction, and what addicts are going through during detox and rehabilitation.  I am so excited to read My Friend Leonard.

B0002DB52M|5.0|You have probably already noticed this but I'll put it in anyway. All great movies take their time. All the great Stanley Kubrick movies are as long as Dogville. And now look at him, hes considered one of the greatest directors of all time. Obviously just because its long doesnt make it good, but dont say making it long makes it bad, because brilliance takes it time. Remember, the longest film ever to win a Best Picture Oscar (Gone With The Wind, 1939), runs for 3 hours and 44 minutes and is the highest grossing film of all time ($5.6 billion).*    Now, back to Dogville. When I put on this video, I hardly expected the result I recieved. At first I was a bit put off by the very original set, but I was also very intrigued by it. I am automatically attracted to things that are different from the herds, but this absolutly struck me off guard. I was not expecting this at all, as the only thing I had read about this film was the blurb once a day or two earlier, and some reviews on here a few weeks earlier, and I did not remember a whole lot about it except that Lars Von Trier was a unique film maker. So the only thing that made me want to watch it was the faint memory of this, and the fact that Nicole Kidman is amazingly beautiful.    There is no point explaining the plot as it has already been done countless times by earlier reviewers. So that brings me to the films budget. I have absolutly no idea why its so high, seeing as though the movie is a bunch of people walking around a room with chalk drawn on the floor, I cant think of anything to spend it on besides a hell of a lot of green screen.    This film explores many themes, all of which deal with human nature. I think while there is a definitive \\"message\\" in all good filmsor art for that matter, but the one that you get out of it is always stronger, no matter how close it is to the artists desired one. That being said, what I was thinking while viewing this is is the arrogant selfishness of human nature. No way is Dogville anti-American, that thought didnt even enter my mind while watching it. Dogville represents the selfish side of every person on earth. No matter how much pain and suffering the people of Dogville cause Grace, they couldnt care less how she feels about it, and they pretend to them selves that they are doing it for her sake, when they are just taking advantage of her good nature. They just keep pushing their lies until they believe it themselves. Anybody can do this given the circumstances, everybody is capable of doing anything given the right circumstances. It is not specific to any race, hence the tag line, \\"A little place not far from here\\".    Now, I absolutly love this film. This is the only Lars Von Trier film I have seen, but I will be watching the other two of his films I own at earliest convenience. I truly believe Lars will go down in history as a great director. The only people who are really recognised and remembered for their work, not only in film making, are the ones who are original and innovative and bring something new to their chosen field. And Dogville is mighty original. Also a lot of things that are now considered brilliant, upon first release were not. Take artists for example, they only became famous after their deaths, and the Beach Boys \\"Pet Sounds\\" album was shunned upon original release, now the editors of Rolling Stone magazine voted it second best album ever made. Nevermind all of this, Dogville is still one of the best movies I've ever seen, no matter what the future holds.    And no one can tell the future, but I predict great things for Mr Von Trier.    -    * Gone With The Wind is the highest grossing film if you account for inflation. Becasue it was made so long ago, and inflation keeps going up obvioulsy its going to keep changing. The current record holder with the current inflation rate is Titanic ($1.5 billion), but I doubt in 50 years that it will still be Titanic.
B000301YY8|5.0|I suggest that Jasmine never buy a CD that says it contains \\"Explicit Lyrics\\". Her review of this CD was based solely on the fact that the word \\"f***ing* was used, rather than the word \\"flying\\". <br /> <br />Her review never discussed the merits or flaws of the CD in terms of the music itself. Giving the CD a 1 rating is not very fair just because you dislike 1 word.
B00005GL0U|5.0|There has never been a band like The Beatles, and Abbey Road is their crowning achievement. The album explores a wide variety of styles from the heavy, driving \\"I Want You\\" to the delicately beautiful \\"Here Comes the Sun\\",  but it's not just the greatness of the songs, the production, and performance that sets this album apart; it's the overall flow.       The closing medley that starts with \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" and runs through \\"The End\\" could be the greatest 15 minutes of pop music ever recorded. Never mind that it was recorded in 1969. If this were released today, it would sound fresh and engaging. And of course, the lyrical message in \\"The End\\" is an all-time classic, and the perfect way to wrap it all up.    Nevertheless, there's still one little ditty tacked on after \\"The End\\".  Although some people feel that \\"Her Majesty\\" doesn't belong there, I love it exactly where it is. There's a bit of political sarcasm in this number, but once again, in a playful, melodic way, and The Beatles had a knack for making things fit just perfectly in places where you wouldn't expect them to.
B000002UAR|5.0|Best album ever, bar none.  Pet Sounds is close.  Exile On Main Street, Highway 61 Revisted; all close.  But none as good.  Simply the best rock album.  Period.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I discovered the Firefly series after watching the movie Serenity last fall, as apparently many others did.  I am mourning the loss of this series, which is truly a unique and artfully crafted production.  Every one of these episodes were a delight--just like the movie Serenity.  I'll be watching closely to see if Sci Fi channel or one of the other networks notices what's going on with this franchise--it shouldn't take a \\"rocket scientist\\" to see that Firefly/Serenity has achieved the necessary critical mass to be a successful program or movie series.

B000063DFW|5.0|Ok this is a great album by all means. But im sorry I HAVE to adress this cotton hell loser. First of all jennifer while brad delson is a good guitarist he doesnt blow any of the people you named away in any sence of the word. 2nd of all Linkin park does not blow Killswitch Engage or Chimaira away either, are you some kind of retard or simpleton? Dude seriously while this is a good album and a great listen raise up off these guys nu*s its not gonna get you backstage or VIP treatment. Grow up and get a grip on reality before somebody slaps it into you. <br /> <br />Moving on now this is a good album for a listen here and there but does get repetative, I had the pleasure of seeing these guys live in 2003 on the Summer Sanitarium tour in Columbus Ohio with names such as Mudvayne (who by the way is the best and put on by far the best show). Mudvayne stole the show and im not saying this because they are my favorite band. Anybody that was at the show can vouche for that. Anyway Linkin Park did do an amazing live set also but they are not better then this moron leads you on to believe. <br /> <br />By this time the band name has been around long rnough to be noticed and become known. Anybody that owns this album knows how good it is. Anybody that doesnt just plainly flat out doesnt like them, not everybody is gonna share your opinion moron. <br /> <br />SORRY
B000005HFH|3.0|You'll either get it, or you won't.   You either like it, or you don't.   Soft-voiced musical genius, or tempermental poseur.  Only the individual listener can decide which they prefer to hear. <br /> <br />   Perhaps this is Chet Baker's vocal legacy.  He is described in the liner notes as either alternating his vocals in emulating \\"a hip Alfalfa...singing grown-up songs...like a child feigning emotional maturity\\", or coming across as \\"a rather tainted Lothario in a fruitless search for lost innocence\\".  Additionally, it also seems, at times, as if \\"there's a whole lot of nothing going on\\". <br /> <br />   These songs are culled from five recording dates in Los Angeles, which took place between October 1953 and July 1956.   Chet sings, and backs up with his trumpet.   Russ Freeman provides the requisite piano emphasis throughout.  Carson Smith and Jimmy Bond alternate half the disc's songs on background bass, while Bob Neel, Peter Littman, and Lawrence Marable split most of their duties whisking the drums.  Joe Mondragon, bass, and Shelly Manne, drums, help kick off the CD on 1953's 'The Thrill Is Gone'. <br /> <br />   Chet's almost androgynous cover-boy looks, and beguilingly winsome sound, contribute to the atmospheric ambivalence. <br />
B00003CWOL|1.0|A poke at religion is ok. But a poke at religion where there is constant obscenities is unsettling and detracts from the movie. The Matt Damon character is particularly hard to listen to.  <br /> <br />There are plenty of movies that are extremely funny but don't have to lower themselves to the gutter to be so......
0974872407|5.0|Definitivamente uno de los mejores libros que he leido en mucho tiempo. <br /> <br />Despues de leer \\"La sombre del viento\\" es muy probable que sientas que otros libros y novelas no te atraigan mucho ya que el gusto que te deja este libro hace que muchos otros te sepan insipidos. <br /> <br />Creo que costara mucho encontrar otro libro de esta calidad en el mercado actual.  <br /> <br />ALtamente recomendable. *****
B00004VXF2|1.0|Like many reviewers have stated this is not music. This is cacophonic noise. You can't listen it throught without getting a headache. I can't play any instrument but I could make a better album. I could for example bang trashcans and record nonsense dialogues and it would be a more interesting album than this. In fact this is the quite boring and annoying experimental album. I can't listen it more than three minutes and it didn't hold up interest. There are not hidden layers under this cacophony.You don't find new things after repeated listenings. Compare it to Frank Zappa's Weasels ripped my flesh and you have to admit that that album has more depth. Unlike many other experimental albums I listened this only twice (Not trought ofcourse) and I didn't want to come back. What is the main problem on this album? The whole idea sucks. Lou Reed's ego probably got too big and he thought it was a masterpiece. Instead of this I recommend Frank Zappa's Weasels ripped my flesh and Alice Cooper's DaDa. Those are great experimental albums.
0316168815|4.0|The has been a lot of \\"hype\\" surrounding this book. It has been on bestseller lists since it was published in July, 2002. That being said, I was never very interested in reading it. The subject matter was not intriguing to me and it's usually not the kind of novel I enjoy reading. However, when I found out that director Peter Jackson (The Lord Of The Rings, King Kong) would be directing a live-action adaptation of it as his next film, I decided to go ahead and read it.  <br /> <br />The Lovely Bones revolves around a fourteen year-old girl (Susie Salmon) that was brutally raped and murdered by a neighbor. She watches from heaven how that single horrible event effects those that were closest to her. Her family is thrown into chaos. Her mother eventually leaves to escape the pain while her father is left to raise her younger sister and brother while still trying to hang on to the memory of the daughter that he will never see again. She also watches the relationships between her friends and how they too were affected by her death. Further still, she watches every move that her killer makes in the hopes that someone will find out the truth about her murder. <br /> <br />There are times when this heart-wrenching tale is somewhat depressing and leaves you wondering if you should keep reading. However, the author's premise for the book is to not have the reader dwell upon the grisly details of a horrible tragedy, but to realize that even in our darkest moments there is still hope that we can cling too. To realize the \\"big picture\\" behind the novel, you have to read to the end. <br /> <br />Alice Sebold is a very gifted writer whose style is very akin to poetry. Her characters are well-developed. At times, I even found myself upset with some of the choices a character would make here or there. Especially the mother, Abigail. Instead of being there for her family when they needed her the most, she returns to a child-like immaturity and runs from her responsibilities including involving herself in an adulterous affair.  <br /> <br />Throughout the entire book, I kept thinking about how lonely these characters were. If only this family was centered around a relationship with Jesus Christ, I believe the events would have unfolded quite differently. They would have found their hope in the grace and love of Christ instead of looking for it within their dead child. This was a perfect example of how life is like without a relationship with God. Tragedy happens to all of us and it is up to us how we respond to it. However, with Christ as the center of our lives, we are assured hope and a love beyond all understanding. <br /> <br />I also found Sebold's view of heaven and out-of-body experiences quite specious. Her heaven is far from perfect. It is where our dreams come alive, but there is still a sense of loneliness the presides. Thank goodness that the truth of heaven, as promised by Jesus, is far greater. This, in itself, is one of the greatest hopes we can have while we are temporarily residing on earth. <br /> <br />I am glad I read this book, but it is definitely not for everyone. It makes you think about tragedies and how you, yourself, handle them. It also seeks to answer the question of how we as individuals seek out hope in the most darkest of cirumstances. It will be very interesting to see what Peter Jackson does with it since it is so far removed from anything he has done yet.
B000AU9UYW|5.0|I just watched Batman Begins and all I can say is WOW!!!, this is \\"THE\\" Batman movie. Its to bad this wasn`t the first of the Batman movies. Its well written with lots of action. The first of the movie is a little slow but the rest makes up for it. If your looking for a couple of hours of good entertainment get this movie.
B000001EXR|4.0|What a shame that at some point someone penned the term \\"grunge\\" to describe this album, and then so many others could find no way to describe it other than using the term.  To me this album is indescribable, but certainly not grunge.  I have been a fan of KISS since the early years, and my musical tastes changed along with the 80's and 90's, I listened to every type of heavy music imaginable, and somehow I cannot see the relation of this album to any Seattle sound.  Definitely a departure from the norm for KISS.  Definitely darker and heavier than Revenge, but I think KISS was at a point when they knew their current lineup was about to disband (Gene and Paul had the reunion planned for years- don't kid yourself if you think otherwise) and they had nothing to lose.  This is purely a stripped down, bare-bones metal album, very introspective and creative, and believe me, it takes alot to impress me musically, but I believe KISS fans of the future will look back on this album as a lost classic, much the way a hardcore group of fans clamor for Music from the Elder today.  I agree that Mr. Simmons rarely does anything without seeing dollar signs behind it, but i think just this once KISS let everything loose and just jammed.  After all, the reunion was a carefully calculated business move to reap more bucks before the band goes out with a bang for good, KISS knew the reunion tours would be successful, and they weren't hurt at all if Carnival of Souls was not a commercial success- as evidenced by shelving it for two years. Just my opinion.
1402714572|5.0|This is the story of a young boy who searches for treasure. The characters are the most memorable thing about this story, including the blind pirate Pew, the passive-aggresive Long John Silver, amongst others. There's some hidden meaning here, but it's pretty buried and probably not noticable if someone doesn't point it out to you.     That said, I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone, only adults who are looking for action adventure. The dialog can be pretty tough in places because it's full of slang. The pirates are especially difficult to understand, even the main character jokes about not understanding one of the pirates. There is a lot of violence, and it's pretty realistic, which is probably not ideal for the little ones.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I own about 60 concert/music DVD's. The video quality of Pulse is average and the 5.1 mix is slightly above average but not crisp like the Eagles and most of the Eric Clapton stuff, among others. The thing I like about the audio is that the surround speakers are very active in this concert. The downside of the audio is that DG's vocals can get washed over by the music and other vocals from time to time. I think if you play around with the subwoofer and center/rear speaker levels you can probably get a little more out of the lead vocals without sacrificing the integrity of the 5.1 mix. However, if you are at all a fan of Pink Floyd you will enjoy the concert. Disc 2 alone is worth the price of the 2 disc set.

B00003CXTG|3.0|On 7 December 1941, Japanese naval aircraft launched a devastating attack against the U.S. Naval Fleet at Pearl Harbor, killing over 2,400 sailors, soldiers, and airmen.   This attack shocked a complacent and isolationist America into action, and the real truth is that only over time did this nation recover from that attack and fight through hard years of combat to win the war and bring it to an end.   The story of Rafe and Danny, and their accidentally-shared relationship with Evelyn, is an honestly emotional story, told well against the backdrop of, and deeply affected by, the onset of the war.  This, I feel, the movie does well.  This reviewer's problem is with this \\"Pearl Harbor's\\" historical inaccuracies.  \\"Before the Doolittle Raid, America knew only defeat, after it, only Victory.\\"  No, not quite.  The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo did NOT turn the tide of the war, as Kate Beckinsale's voice-over at the end of \\"Pearl Harbor\\" claimed. Instead, America continued to face many other other setbacks in the war after the December 7th attack, and it was not until the terrible and bloody battle at Midway - which happened some time after the Doolittle raid - that the fortunes of the war were reversed in the Pacific to America's favor.   According to this movie, however, something more important than that was the love triangle story going on between Ben and Kate and Josh. Now, don't get me wrong - during wars, men who were presumed dead in combat probably have returned home to find that, in their absence, when they were presumed dead, their wives had re-married and gone on with their lives. IF things like this happen in real life during war, then it's one of the many sad costs of war. I grant that.   But, let's be honest - If you see that a film called \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is about to be released, what do YOU expect?   While \\"Pearl Harbor\\" placed a heartbreaking and honestly emotional lover's-triangle story in front of the attack on Pearl Harbor, it gave us a very fictionalized visualization of the attack itself. I was in the Navy and stationed at Pearl Harbor in the early 1970s, when Knox-Class escort ships were in service, and the then-new Spruance-Class destroyers were just coming off the drawing boards, and Ticonderoga-Class Missile Frigates were brand-new warships in the 1970s, a full 30 years AFTER the attack on Pearl Harbor. These obviously 1970-vintage ships stick out like a sore thumb all over the \\"Pearl Harbor\\" attack scenes. [There were a few glimpses of these types of vessels in \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\", but in that superior film, this error was mercifully minimized.]   The use of 1970s-built ships for a film about events in 1941 just does not fly.   The Battleship USS Nevada was the only armored battleship int eh harbor to get under way during that attack.  Her sortie is a major part of the story of the Pearl harbor attack.  It is not in this movie at all.  If all that money can be spent on CGI re-creations of ships like the USS Arizona and her destruction, then it could and should have also been used to make sure that every ship we saw in film was a ship built prior to 1941.   Imagine a film set during the American Civil War of the 1860s with Model Ts chugging around in the background.  You KNOW they will not be invented until forty years later in the early 1900s.  Do YOU think that would be good filmmaking?   Add to that the images \\"Pearl Harbor\\" gives us of 1941 Japanese planes that seemed to be able to out-fly today's jet aircraft. Jerry Bruckheimer brought a little too much \\"Top Gun\\" to the flight scenes of this film.   If you want a well-told accidental love triangle played by attractive young actors in front of a film about the attack that brought America into World War Two, and you are willing to risk missing the truth about one of the most tragic events of the 20th Century, which changed the course of history, and re-shaped the world that you and I wake up in every morning, then \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is for you.   Also, if you wantto see a romance played out against the time and place of the days leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, you might also like \\"From Here To Eternity\\".  That film may be old, but it's a good one.   And finally, I will say what so many other people who honor the memory of our   brave armed service men and women who have fallen in battle have said:   For the ultimate movie about the real events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor,   and the attack itself, buy the widescreen edition of \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\".   THAT movie gets the real story right.   Doug Peschka,   U.S. Navy Veteran
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this <br />album is the worst Korn album ever. <br />There is only about 2 song's that <br />I like on it and that are good. <br />The first song,\\"Twisted Transistor\\" <br />is a good song.Also track #11 called <br />\\"Liar\\" is a great tune.But other than that <br />there is no song's that are musically <br />worth a listen too.If you're a fan that <br />wants to own all the albums just to collect <br />tham that's fine.But if you just wanna listen <br />to it just buy the singles. <br /> <br />I hope this was a helpful review for everyone. <br />
B000002BMD|5.0|All the songs of this albums are brilliant, i haven't heard such a 100 % accuracy since Ramones selftitled album. Lirically, the Manic Street Preachers do have something to say (unlike the tons of crap we hear on the radio every day). And the music is just excellent. Interiors (song for willem de kooning) is my favourite song of the album, the vocals really hit your nerves, and the guitar dives in a supersonic limbo. <br />I wouldn't put the MSP among the bands of the brit pop wave, they AIN'T BRIT POP. This is a great welsh alternative rock band, not some Oasis copycats. No fancy looks, no multimedia fights between it's members, just tight, well executed, full of emotion, rock. <br />Get yourself a copy, this album is a jewel of the ninetys, as good as Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\".
B0009A21R6|5.0|I own 7 versions of this album now (LP's, Cassettes, CD's ect.), and this is by far the best for one reason: The 5.1 mix. As many times as I have listened to this album, I hear things I have never heard before with the 5.1 mix. In my opinion, this is THE greatest album of all time. They did a superb job on the 5.1 mix, as it isn't rolling around the room, but has a combination soundstage and background. Some percussion and specialty instuments are in the rear channels, but Knopfler is in the center channel, where he should be, and the main instruments are well placed to create a life-like soundstage. Just writing this review makes me want to plug it in right now.  <br /> <br />If you are not sure weather or not to get it: <br />You made it this far, you are interested. If you are the least bit interested.... GET IT! You will be glad you did.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|This is another re-release of Lucas' directors' cut, now with even more changes than last go 'round. I don't want a paste in of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker at the end of Return of the Jedi, I want to see what I saw in the theaters! We'll have to wait for Lucas to die to see the real movies we saw in the theaters. Would I mind the extra footage if it were optional? No, of course not. But with today's DVD technology, the USER should get to decide whether or not to view the original theatrical releases vs. the director's cut. Bad form!
0783228457|4.0|Videodrome is a good movie.<br />I'm not here to write Cronenberg hero worship. There is enough of that here.<br /><br />I don't aim to delve into the sterile observations on the darker side of humanity. I think others here have indulged that aspect of the film to exhaustion. After all, psychoanalyzing the depth of human depravity, and the way TV and mass-culture desensitizes us was hardly a revolutionary concept, even in 1983. Cronenberg obviously toys with the audience as Brian O'Blivion plays with Jame Woods' character Max, when he says:<br /><br /> -  \\"Why would anybody watch a scum show like Videodrome?<br /> -  Why did you watch it, Max?<br /> -  Business reasons.<br /> -  Sure, Sure.\\"<br /><br />We're all just detached observers, right?<br />But this is all well treaded ground.<br /><br />For all the touting of its special effects, the mundane objects of its fetishism- CRT picture tubes and VCR tapes, are decidedly dated and the movie will feel dated when you watch it. Possibly because the presentation is contextually in the low-fi analog past, a large part of its mesage seems to be lost on many viewers:<br /><br />What even constitutes reality?<br /><br />The quantum leap that a hyper-real projected reality will have, when we are no longer simply \\"observers\\" of the screen, but immersed in this video world where the real and the unreal are perceptively indistinguishable. This will change us as a society, as a civilization, even as a species.<br /><br />Videodrome introduces a headset device:<br /><br /> -  \\"Here she is. This is our prototype.<br /> -  This is the little number that started it all.<br /> -  Max, I would like you to try this on for size.\\"<br /><br />I will give away part of the movie here- at one point Max never takes the apparatus, the headgear, off (Note the similarity to the plot device used in 2001's Vanilla Sky.). Is this machine really \\"recording\\" Max's hallucinations or creating them? From this point forward, Max is stuck in his own virtual world, created from his own mind, and whatever sensory input Spectacular Optical's device is projecting- the infamous \\"signal\\", of course. Is it real? Where does the line blur? Is it just one hypothetical future for Max? If it's all projection, does this make it less real? If it is believed to be real by Max, is there really any difference? If other reviewers seemed to have overlooked a central point of the movie, does that mean it doesn't exist?<br /><br />1983, Videodrome's Brian O'Blivion:<br /> -  \\"After all, there is nothing real outside our perception of reality, is there?\\"<br /><br />1999, The Matrix's Morpheus:<br /> -  \\"What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.\\"<br /><br />Videodrome foresaw the kind of fully-immersive virtual reality that we are just now beginning to see hints come into being with video game headset consoles and the like. William Gibson's Neuromancer, which coined the term \\"cyberspace\\", wasn't published until a year later.<br /><br />1983 also saw the cinematic release of Brainstorm, which covered some parallel territory. Though exceptionally different in tone and presentation, these two movies make for good contemporary juxtapositions to one another.<br /><br />I do recommend this movie.is projecting- the infamous \\"signal\\", of course. Is it real? Where does the line blur? Is it just one hypothetical future for Max? If it's all projection, does this make it less real?

If other reviewers seemed to have overlooked a central point of the movie, does that mean it doesn't exist?    1983, Videodrome's Brian O'Blivion:   -  \\"After all, there is nothing real outside our perception of reality, is there?\\"    1999, The Matrix's Morpheus:   -  \\"What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.\\"    Videodrome foresaw the kind of fully-immersive virtual reality that we are just now beginning to see hints come into being with video game headset consoles and the like. William Gibson's Neuromancer, which coined the term \\"cyberspace\\", wasn't published until a year later.    1983 also saw the cinematic release of Brainstorm, which covered some parallel territory. Though exceptionally different in tone and presentation, these two movies make for good contemporary juxtapositions to one another.    I do recommend this movie.
B000000OU0|5.0|If you were a fan of the Eagles back in the 70's and 80's you probably know the meaning behind the title. For those of you that don't, when The Eagles took \\"a break\\" from playing together in the early 80's they did so because of a lot of fighting. When asked when they would play together again the response was \\"When hell freezes over!\\".<br /><br />The full concert that's on this CD is their first performance (talk about guts!) back together again. The song selection, performances and audio are amazing. I loved all the old classics but also loved the new song \\"Get Over It\\" which came from \\"Watching too much daytime tv where there are way too many stupid people with way too many stupid problems\\".<br /><br />Easily 5 out of 5 stars. Click add to cart and enjoy!
B000BO0LKY|5.0|The album is very good; it is well over an hour long (which is what I always like). But it could be real complete with \\"Sprung\\" and \\"Secret Love\\", the two Japanese bonus tracks and the Mariah/Jadakiss duet, \\"U Make Me Wanna\\" (they'll fit!). This album does deserve the title of 2005's best selling album, ALONGSIDE Madonna's \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\", not just the latter. For all those negative reviews of this wonderful album, you're merely jealous.  <br /> <br />It's Like That - Hang-out anthem? Maybe. That's the song's theme, after all. 5/5 <br /> <br />We Belong Together - One of my most favorite songs ever. A sequel to the first song? Maybe just the videos, but this song rocks SUPER!! 5/5 <br /> <br />Shake It Off - Why oh why is this song's theme so opposite to \\"We Belong Together\\"? The tune is very good for dancing, though. I COULD shake someone off.... 5/5 <br /> <br />Mine Again - A ballad in this album? That's EXACTLY what it needs! We could do with a duet, though. 5/5 <br /> <br />Say Something - Here Mariah says \\"****\\". I don't care, you know; the song's still real nice! Why don't you rap instead, Snoop Dogg? LOL 5/5 <br /> <br />Stay the Night - It does sound like you want your friend to stay the night. Doesn't sound as party-ish as \\"It's Like That\\" and \\"Shake It Off\\", though. 5/5 <br /> <br />Get Your Number - I've never heard Jermaine Dupri sing before. Personally, he is better off with rapping. 5/5 <br /> <br />One and Only - What can I say? There's a Part 2 still! Twista, you did real great in those tracks.... 5/5 <br /> <br />Circles - Quite all right.... 4/5 <br /> <br />Your Girl - Too short....I'd give it a five if it was longer. 4/5 <br /> <br />I Wish You Knew - Knew what? Hahaha (LOL) 4/5 <br /> <br />To the Floor - Another dance anthem? 4/5 <br /> <br />Joy Ride - Very good song. 5/5 <br /> <br />Fly Like a Bird - Normally I don't like Christian/Gospel music much, but this one I really like! 5/5 <br /> <br />Don't Forget About Us - Yep, it's a sequel to \\"We Belong\\", as far as the theme is concerned. Sounds very 90's, and I like it! 5/5 <br /> <br />Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do) - Cute tune ^__^ and cute JD rap! Should I dance to it...? 5/5 <br /> <br />So Lonely - The sequel is better than the first part. If this song becomes #1 again, Mariah is the best artist ever! 4/5 <br /> <br />We Belong Together Remix - More disco-ish than the original version (which I still love more). I love this track. It gives new meaning to \\"remix\\". 5/5
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am going to keep this brief, since there are a couple thousand people that have said the same thing.<br /><br />GO BUY THIS SHOW! I never saw the show when it was actually on, but I purcahsed the DVD set because of all the rave reviews I was hearing, and I have to say that it was the best blind buy that I have ever had.<br /><br />With all the garbage on television, Firefly offered something new, different, funny, and well developed. Purcahse this series NOW! You will NOT regret it!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I'm a relative newcomer to the world of The Beatles myself, and logically decided to start off with a compilation of their hit singles. While 1 is a fair overview of songs in which the band found the most commercial success (and hey, how can you beat a 27 song CD for value?), most songs (particularly those from their earlier era) held little appeal to me. It wasn't until I heard the brilliant Abbey Road in its entirety, that I was convinced of The Beatles' genius. Like in many other cases, it's in the individual albums that you find the real gems. I'd recommend starting with that release, and then moving on to the equally essential, Sgt. Pepper's.
B000BNI90O|5.0|This is a great addition to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Anyone that is a fan of music and how music is composed and used in thematic fashion should have this set. The Adams booklet is outstanding and the annotated score found on the soundtrack website is also great. <br /> <br />The music is so much more complete here than in the regular soundtrack. I agree with the earlier review that said you could really trash the soundtrack purchased originally and use this one. The motifs used are absolutely amazing and they have added in the bonuses of hearing the Lay of Luthien by Mortenson and the Lament for Gandalf. Wonderful pieces. <br /> <br />Also, many of the tracks are extended from what they were in the movie. Just a great collection of Shore's music and is really shows was a great composer he is.
B000BNX3B4|1.0|As far as movies go, you must love \\"dogs\\" to like this one.  The story is totally predictable, the dialogue is banal, the direction is wooden and the pace can be charitably described as glacial.  The movie is like that battery rabbit-\\"It just keeps going and going and going\\".      Yes, it's a 'chick flick', but that doesn't explain why this one just lays there.  Yes, we have the requisite gorgeous and intelligent female protagonist who inexplicably thinks she can't enter into a relationship.  We have the sensitive \\"diamond in the rough\\" man who doesn't yet realize that he is damn near perfect.  We have the standard misadventures until they realize they are Meant To Be Together.  So what's wrong?      I wouldn't have believed it possible, but someone has actually made Diane Lane uninteresting.  You really don't care about her, and it's hard to tell if she cares about the men in her life because she really cares or because she thinks she should care.  She eventually meets two men who seem great and there are a few humorous incidents, including the \\"search for condoms\\", but mostly it just excruciatingly drags along.      One problem they write themselves into is that the guy who is a \\"rival\\" to John Cusack (whose character also has no charisma) is such a great guy.  The only way the writers know how to handle this is to have him turn out to be an ass.  Problem is, this is totally out of character relative to how he's been in the entire rest of the movie.  Diane Lane then has no choice (after the standard epiphany of self awareness) but to fly to the man who basically is second choice.  In other words, \\"We belong together because who I'd rather be with is a bum and I choose you by process of elimination\\".      The real flaw is here is that none of the characters have any depth or are particularly interesting.   \\"Chick flicks\\" can be well done and fun, just go back about 10 years and ask Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock.  They aren't though, when everyone walks through \\"ChickFlick by the Numbers\\", which is what we have here.  Come to think of it, that would have been a better title for the movie.
B000BISBDY|5.0|I have never been a big fan of country music. My main music of choice is of the heavy metal genre such as Black Sabbath and Judas Priest, and newer groups like nine inch nails, and the harder edged industrial stuff. I always thought Johnny Cash was kind of cool, but until today I never really listened closely to his music. I recently became curious about the CD, and was happy to get it as a Xmas gift. I went for a ride on this cold, cloudy day in late December, and it could not be a better day to introduce myself to the man in black's music. All I can say is this Cd, of what are his classic songs, is just brilliant, and timeless - a very enjoyable listen. The CD is a real gem, and I would suggest anyone who is even the least bit curious about Cash to go out and get this. To me, it's a work of art that deserves a spot on my shelf right alongside the other CDs from varoius genres that I consider essential classics.
B00005V9IJ|4.0|I picked \\"Cast Away\\" with some hesition = previous<br /><br />effort by Zemeckis and Hanks - \\"Forrest Gump\\" was<br /><br />annoying, calculated and syrupy feel-good movie that<br /><br />was constantly tugging your sleeve to nag you \\"oh -<br /><br />please - feel TOUCHED by this movie\\". \\"Forrest Gump\\" was<br /><br />OK and entertaining - but emotionally did nothing for me.<br /><br />So I was pleasently surprized by \\"Cast Away\\" (which I<br /><br />finally watched on DVD). Zemeckis managed to keep  the<br /><br />sentimental part under control and let the story unfold<br /><br />and speak for itself (kudos for last scene!).<br /><br />Hanks acting and reality of the life on a small island<br /><br />is done very, very well. I especially liked the distance<br /><br />surrounding him after his return.<br /><br />It is a solid, entertaining movie that respects your IQ<br /><br />and delivers the package. You finish it and you feel that<br /><br />it left you bit richer and not wasted two hours of your life.
B00003003R|5.0|GnR was one of the best live bands ever...whenever Alx showed up that is! If you don't have any GnR albums and you want to start out pick this one up. It has all their best...except \\"Civil War\\". Disc one pretty much covers everything from Appetite For Destruction - Disc two mostly covers hits from Use Your Illusion 1 & 2.  <br /> <br />Favorites: \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", \\"November Rain\\", \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", and \\"Dust N' Bones\\". <br /> <br />[...]
B000BYRCH4|3.0|From Smother Magazine  - smother.net:<br /><br />This movie stars Jessica Alba in a bikini. Okay, so there's other elements to the movie but the one that will get all the guys flocking to Blockbuster is Alba's bum-but don't worry girls, you get to see Paul Walker being buff and what-not. Besides the obvious T&A (PG-13 style), the movie is pretty entertaining in the way that action-adventures can be. Throw in some hilarious Scott Caan moments and Josh Brolin (forever known as \\"Brand\\" to me from his role in \\"the Goonies\\") and you have yourself a nice popcorn bash. The movie is about a young diver who hunts for sunken treasure and boats off the coast of the Bahamas. After discovering a downed plane that contains kilos of cocaine, Walker and his friends find what they believe to be a buried pirate ship near it. Now they just need to raise some cash to unearth the buried pirate ship and its wealth before someone else lays claim to the find. And how do you think they'll do that? Exactly. Entertaining and fun.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|Legendary Led Zeppelin frontman, Robert Plant, shows he still has it after all these years. Out of all of Plant's solo albums this one is the best. The Strange Sensation is Plant's band and they play good on this album.     \\"Another Tribe\\", \\"Dancing In Heaven\\", and \\"Mighty Rearranger\\" are my favorites off this project.    [...]  [...]
B000BW7QWW|4.0|From Smother Magazine - smother.net:<br /><br />I wasn't holding my breath for this movie but my good friend at work kept insisting on its state of awesomeness so I figured I'd give it a whirl once it the DVD circuit. I watched the first half an hour and thought to myself what a bad straight from UPN (or WB, whatever network \\"Firefly\\" was on) but thankfully it got a lot better once the action really started. As far as Sci-Fi goes, there usually aren't a lot of good movies out there; sure every now and again you'll get your \\"Matrix\\" or \\"Alien\\" or even \\"Predator\\" but typically they're low budget affairs that have horrible acting and even worse cinematography. While the dialogue throughout \\"Serenity\\" was cheesy and comedic (Captain Malcolm Reynolds reminded me of the captain prince hero from Mel Brooks' \\"Space Balls\\"), the action was great and the storyline was compelling. And a virgin viewer of this movie whom had never seen nor heard of \\"Firefly\\" can still follow the plot without struggle. But what really stood out for me was how intriguing the cinematography was; the galaxy was etched well as were all of the sets on the ground. You won't find any big name movie stars here, unless you count Adam Baldwin (based on his last name and not his acting skills of course), but I will tell you that Yan and Rafael Feldman are NOT related to Corey! Go and rent it, my work buddy will be happy you did!
0679882820|5.0|This book was one of my favorites as a kid.  This version, though edited/shortened to fit a board book format, still maintains the charm and fun of the original.  We purchased it for my 3-month old son, and he absolutely loves when we read this book to him.  The different sounds and the rhythm of the words mesmerize him.  Highly recommended!
B0000028M7|5.0|Buy this album, simple and sweet. one of the best albums from one of the top 5 greatest bands ever. nuff said.
0441003257|5.0|Everything that need to be said about this delightful book has been said. Written in 1990, Good Omens and its 2 endearing characters, Aziraphale and Crowley, have not lost their magic the second time I finished it today (Dec 31 pm 2005 and the apocalypse is not here yet? eh..) Do yourself a favor and get this book. This is one enjoyment any reader should not miss.
0895260131|3.0|I went ahead and gave this book three stars because I was impressed with the author's bravery in refuting some PC myths. I was perturbed to see my president pleading for friendship with the Muslim world after 9/11. I found equally, if not more, daunting that more decent mainstream Muslims did not come forward to condemn these acts of terrorism. I realize it could just be a bias of the mainstream American media, but it seems to me that after each of the bombings Muslims somehow made themselves the victims instead of the civilians who were murdered.    At times the author uses tenuous claims and descends into outright bashing. If he had included the many atrocities committed by Christians he could have called his book The Ugly History of Monotheistic Offshoots. Moreover, if he had included the Cultural Revolution he could have called it Loathsome Fanatics Go Wild and probed the origins of virulent fanatical devotion to some higher power, whether it is Mao and the Great Proletarian Revolution, Jesus and a Salvation, or Allah and jihad. He doesn't really delve into the question of what makes otherwise nice normal people turn into murderous fanatics whether it's Nazis who murdered children at Auschwitz and then sat down to dinner with their own children or bands of teenaged Red Guards who turned on and sometimes beat to death their teachers. And what is it that causes others to sit back and do nothing?    Where is the chasm between the Ayatollah Khomeni calling for the death author Salman Rusdie and Evangelist Pat Robertson declaring on international TV that the US should assassinate Venezuela's president? (I am no fan of Hugo Chaves Frias. I was living in Caracas when the coup d'etat against him and the subsequent counter coup took place. Rioting ensued and I couldn't leave the apartment for two weeks. The official number of those killed in my middle class neighborhood was 14. The guy has a screw loose and he tried to violently overthrow is predecessor. The fact of thematter is; unfortunately, he was democratically elected by his compatriots, just like Bush.)    When I asked a pastor about the history of atrocities committed by Christians against the Jews (Crusades, pograms, Inquisitions,Holocaust) who gave us the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and a \\"Savior\\" he explained to me that those murderous fanatics weren't \\"real\\" Christians. I suspect if I asked an imam about the Muslim aggressors in this book he would probably say the same thing.    For those who would be swept away by the fervor of this book consider that Christians conquered all of the Americas and the Caribbean with gunpowder as opposed to the sword and the New Testament as opposed to the Qu'ran. I'm not out to vilify, justify, or apologize and I realize that this is a book about the history of Islam and it should be read and the links visited but I ask that readers keep it in balance by also researching: Cortez, Pizzaro, Inquisition, autos da fe, pograms, Crusades, the other 1492 (the expulsion of Jews from Spain and confiscation of their property which helped finance Queen Isabella's conquests), the Cultural Revolution, Tamil Tigers, Sendero Luminoso, ETA, and the IRA.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|<br /> <br />As a child, I really knew nothing about music beyond Shari Lewis and Lamb Chops or Kids Songs. But I was fortunate enough to remember hearing Sarah McLachlan's \\"Possession,\\" on the radio: A song destined to be stuck in my head until I heard again at a much older age. The older I got the more I heard about Sarah McLachlan and her musical exploits through the CD \\"Surfacing.\\" That CD was heavy on the sadness, but it was beautiful sadness expressed through Mclachlan's lyrical talents and piano playing (accompanied by her band members respectfully) that brought tears to my eyes. I practically wore out my Mother's copy of the last CD Sarah Mclachlan made before her hiatus and I am proud to say that I own my very CD by the artist. Ironically it would be her 2003 release \\"Afterglow.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />While many people (loyal fans or not) were disappointed in this CD saying that it wasn't her best work, I have basically have to disagree. AFTERGLOW is a more light hearted approach of Sarah's music while still retaining the melancholy emotion \\"Surfacing\\" without so much angst included. I've listened to the CD in its entirety though I do not most of the tracks on the CD by heart despite how few there are. The most recognizable tracks are \\"Fallen\\" -- \\"World on Fire\\" -- \\"Stupid\\" -- \\"Train Wreck\\" and \\"Drifting.\\" All of which are my favorite because if my honest opinion, there are the most diversified, if not the more gripping songs on the track. Many of the songs are relatable with me, because of the way the things written in the lyrics.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And while the entire CD itself is an overall joy to listen, there are times when it does seem a bit lackluster and ultimately boring to listen to if played one too many times. One out the Ten tracks on this soundtrack I do not like is the song Dedicated to Mclachlan's husband (as she said in her \\"AFTERGLOW - LIVE\\" concert I saw with DIRECT-TV FREEVIEW) \\"Push.\\" While it has its own sweet tune and Sarah Mclachlan pulls it off in such a way you have to like it, to me it just sounds like another Romantic song you hear from lesser singers in my opinion. All in all AFTERGLOW is a riveting listen for anyone looking for a break from today's would be singers with lyrics written for them. Its defiantly Sarah Mclachlan's best current CDs out at the present moment, though I would recommend the AFTERGLOW - LIVE CD/DVD for those weary of buying this one. <br /> <br /> <br />1. Fallen - 5/5 <br /> <br />2. World on Fire - 4/5 <br /> <br />3. Stupid - 5/5 <br /> <br />4. Drifting - 4/5 <br /> <br />5. Train Wreck - 4/5 <br /> <br />6. Push - 3/5 <br /> <br />7.

0316666343|4.0|While reading Sebold's work I found myself looking back on my own childhood, however her writing style is honest and simple which holds the readers eyes down upon every page. At first, the book reads very slowly although the first chapter which clearly shines a horrid light down upon a rape scene touches the heart of the victim Susie who becomes a spirit in her own heaven. But as her haunting story unfolds the reader begins to understand the different characters in her life, school mates, friends, family, teachers and each individual person brings a beautiful element to the novels dynamic plot. The structure of the book itself is very deep and often layered with fluent language that speaks to the mind, body and soul. The book is a wonderful debut novel from a very good writer, I hope that everyone reads this book. When you discover yourself turning the last page you can't help but miss all of the situations and people you encountered. Alice Sebold is a brilliant story-teller and her work will be read by the curoius minds of tomorrow, perhaps for ages to come.
068987474X|5.0|This is an excellent book. I got it and finished it in the same day. I am going to pass this on to every woman I know!
0307276902|3.0|The good:  An excellent job of describing addiction in a way I can only imagine.  I've had friends nearly as bad off as James was upon entering rehab (one has since died) and I know how hard it is from the loved ones perspective.  I felt for his desire to change and feel I can maybe understand a bit better about my friends' addictions. <br /> <br />The bad:  The man is a narcissist.  He doesn't need to follow 12-steps, he doesn't need to listen to lectures, he doesn't need advice offered by counselors in rehab, he doesn't need to follow rules, he goes unpunished when he fails to follow rules, he can bitch about a rock star embellishing, and turn around an clearly embellish his own life story, he can jeapordize another's (Lilly) recovery by thinking of his own desires, everyone who likes him loves him, everyone that doesn't like him is an f'n loser. All typical addict thoughts, how he stays in recovery is beyond me.  How they let him out with that attitude is beyond me. <br /> <br />The book overall was still riveting, albeit a bit long in places.   As other's have expressed in reviews, my biggest concern is for addicts who read this and come to the conclusion than can go solo because James did.   So maybe the book would work best as a \\"scared straight\\" for youngsters thinking to experiment, but it will only enable the full blown addicts to continue their life without real change.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|Into the Blue was not a disappointment. The best part about INTO THE BLUE was the direction. Seriously. There were actually some scenes that looked like Walker and Alba maybe just learned their lines THAT DAY. Other scenes seemed smoother, but you could actually tell that the actors were not familiar with the material and the dialogue seemed stilted and like... well... being an actor myself... it seemed like they were struggling to remember what they had to say as they were talking.<br /><br />Otherwise... the movie was actually really good and I credit the director, John Stockwell, who is also known for acting stints in Top Gun, Christine & My Science Project. FOR ONCE!! A DIRECTOR TREATED US LIKE WE ARE INTELLIGENT BEINGS AND DIDN'T CHEAT US! No, movies most important job isn't to inform, but they are supposed to be realistic. After watching INTO THE BLUE, I had a better understanding of the DIVE trade and it was completely necessary to move the movie along.<br /><br />Stockwell did his homework. He cared about the audience and cared that they know what was going on. He didn't preach or bog the story down with diving lessons, he made diving and what they had to do part of the story.<br /><br />Stockwell shot a beautiful movie with wonderful underwater scenes that are engrossing and sharp. Not to mention, necessary story movers.<br /><br />Not only did he deliver the goods with the diving scenes, he delivered with a sharp story about modern day ocean pirates, club life, drug life and WHAT TRULY MAKES A person successful? Is it money? or is it Love?<br /><br />You know what. I hope Hollywood stops giving these great idea movies to the Emmerichs and Bays of the worlds and starts giving more of these movies to people like Stockwell. Directors that don't insult our intelligence, do their homework and understand that movies have to be more than just an explosion here and there. It has to be sensible. Fine job and I'm looking forward to owning this one on DVD.
0316776963|1.0|You may like Sedaris only if you watch network television sitcoms religiously. <br />  <br />Needless to say---------This book is a complete waste of money. <br /> <br /> The myopic and tired humor is great only for a specific audience, the male homosexual drug having lived in France. If you fit this demographpic, perhaps you will feel some bonding that may get you through the bad writing, though it may still be a battle. <br /> <br />There is not a shred of true wit in this book.  It is simply cheap poor lifts from the Hunter Thomas genre and perhaps preening gay dialogue found in a gay TV sitcoms( if they existed.) <br /> <br />This book simply does not appeal to a general readership.  Literacy  seems to have not yet reached bottom yet in the United States.  <br /> <br />A total waste of time. <br /> <br />I hope your bookstore will allow you to exchange the book so you do not take the hit from paid promoters here and from the advertising/marketing machine.
0767802470|5.0|I'm a big fan of submarine movies and this is a great one. I really appreciate the obsession for technical accuracy.<br /><br />Not much I can add to the other reviews here but I think it's curious and worth noting that the English subtitles are completely different from the English dubbing. Unlike some reviewers I thought the dubbed version was just fine, but it must be a separate translation from the subtitles. In some cases the meaning is subtly or completely different.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|i really wanted to like this movie..great cast..well acted..the look of the movie gives off a very eerie presence..but the ghost aspect of the movie and the ending very disappointing..connelly is superb
0790729601|5.0|I'd just like to know if this Eraser dvd is the full uncut version. I bought the vhs here in the uk a few years ago, only to find it had been chopped to pieces. So much had been taken from the cinema version to get a 15 instead of an 18 rating that even the train hitting the limo at the end was gone. I mean, what the crap? it was very annoying to say the least and I've recently hired the dvd and that too is missing the final explosion along with having several other very badly edited scenes. What is with the distributors? I thought we'd got over this whole chop everything to pieces thing that went on back in the 80s/90s. So if someone on here reading this knows if this is the full version, then I'll order it from here. Eraser is a great movie and I'd love to see the full movie again. Cheers.
B00006G8G1|3.0|If you saw this band and video for the first time, you would think it was several different solo acts.  The video editing is downright frustrating to watch.  You hardly ever see a full band shot for more than 2 seconds.  And...why video instead of film?  Bad decision.  Watch both Alice Cooper videos..TRASHES THE WORLD and BRUTALLY LIVE if you want a lesson in live video.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Omg I was a fan since the first episode.  All you need to know about this series, pretty much sums it up in the first episode.  It has to be the best pilot I have ever seen.  I know that Emily and Richard are snotty, but I do not think that there would be any Gilmore Girls without Friday night dinners.<br /><br />The show wouldn't be the same with different actors, its perfect!<br /><br />I just have one question about it, I mean I know who Kirk is, but in the 2nd episode (The Lorelais' First Day at Chilton), when Lorelai comes home to find him installing a DSL, well he says his name is Mick, so that can be confusing to some people.<br /><br />Dean has to be the most perfect boyfriend ever, I want my boyfriend to be like that, it wouldn't hurt to look like that either.  Also, I know that Triston likes Rory and she has no clue, but they could've went further on that, I think it would have been great if they would have done more than kiss, I mean like date or something, not sex!<br /><br />I am officially addicted to this show, and I cant wait until the 6th season comes off TV and on to DVD, I hate waiting a whole week to watch it.  I mean now that I have the DVDs seasons 1-5 I need to watch it everyday, can't go through a day without a Gilmore moment lol.<br /><br />Anyways, in the 1st season, Lorelai borrows money from her snotty parents and has to now come to dinner every Friday night. She meets Max, it doesn't work.  You can tell Luke and Lorelai like eachother! Rory gets her 1st boyfriend Dean, who is perfect. Rory gets accepted to Chilton, a prep school, one step closer to Harvard. Max and Lorelai get back together, with a unanswered purposal and 1000 yellow daises at the end.  All in all, its a awesome show, no one will be disappointed!<br /><br />I had my friend watch it with me, she was hesitant and now she is just as addicted to it!<br /><br />Buy the 1st season, its great!
B000002MFN|5.0|The Erotica CD was released in October 1992 when Madonna was beginning a downward slide in popularity in the U.S.  Just two years earlier she ruled the world and could do no wrong, but the release of Madonna's Sex book and the steamy video for Erotica put Madonna on the front lines of controversy again.  Many people, some fans included, just thought she was going too far with the sexual provocativeness this time.   <br /> <br />As a result, the sales for Erotica were disappointing compared to her previous CDs, and the singles didn't fare as well as one might expect:   <br /> <br />Erotica #3 (BB Hot 100)/#1 (BB Dance) <br />Deeper & Deeper #7 (BB Hot 100)/#1 (BB Dance)  <br />Rain #14 (BB Hot 100) <br />Bad Girl #36 (BB Hot 100) <br />Fever #1 (BB Dance) <br />   <br />Erotica is without a doubt one of Madonna's finest albums - in my opinion it is her fourth best behind Ray Of Light, Like A Prayer, and her current release Confessions On A Dancefloor.  Many fans rank Erotica at #1.  An argument can easily be made that this is her most underrated album.   <br /> <br />Madonna up to this point had been commercially huge, but only when Like A Prayer hit in '89 did she first really get some critical acclaim.  She had always been accused of being deliberately cold and calculating in her music career: \\"calculating\\" new trends, \\"planning out\\" the hits.  With \\"Erotica\\" she stuck her middle finger out at the critics with an album that's deliberately cold and calculating but brilliant at the same time.  Madonna worked with producer Shep Pettibone on this CD, and the production is slick, methodical, and mechanical.  Lyrically, the album definitely has a darker tone compared to her others.   <br /> <br />As I read in one description Erotica was Madonna's statement about love in the era of AIDS.  And that theme is reflected clearly two of the three ballads on the album:  \\"Rain\\" and \\"In This Life\\", which both address the issue of AIDS.  \\"Rain\\" still stands as one of Madonna's bestballads and vocal performances to date (should have been a bigger hit!), and is the more subtle of the two ballads. \\"In This Life\\" talks about people Madonna had lost in her life to the disease.  The other ballad on the CD is \\"Bad Girl\\", a track even more underrated than \\"Rain\\".  This is a song about a woman that can't seem to keep herself headed in the right direction, and ends up on a fast path to self destruction.  The video is a classic - starring Christopher Walken.       <br /> <br />\\"Deeper & Deeper\\" is the standout dance track on the CD, a song somewhat open to interpretation but to me talks about someone falling deeper and deeper into a trap of short-lived meaningless relationships.  The song has a great breakdown to a Spanish flamenco guitar in the middle. <br /> <br />\\"Fever\\" is a cover of the Peggy Lee classic hit and became a #1 Billboard dance/club hit in 1993.   <br /> <br />And of course who can forget the title track.  This song has grown on me over the years - definitely memorable as the point when Madonna was at her \\"baddest\\".  The video was unforgettable - Madonna as her alter-ego Dita - and was only played on MTV late at night. <br /> <br />Of the non-single tracks on the album, \\"Why It's So Hard\\" is my absolute favorite.  In fact, this is one of my top favorites of all of Madonna's unreleased album tracks.  This one sums up the album's theme quite well - a song simply asking why its so hard for people to love and respect each other in the world.  This one was a hit when Madonna performed it on her \\"Girlie Show\\" tour. <br /> <br />This is the type of album that makes Madonna stand out as an artist from her other contemporaries like Janet Jackson or Mariah Carey.  I'm sorry but as talented as they are, they could never make (and have never made) an album as complex and multi-faceted as this one.  This album is one of Madonna's strongest statements, and sounds completely different from anything else she's done. <br />
B0001HAISG|4.0|It is undoubtedly fun to watch but if you were a kid in the 90s, you'd know what happens next. You can just predict scene after scene.<br /><br />The guy playing Peter Pan was a great actor in my opinion, he had different expressions which fully showed what he felt like. Wendy, on the other hand, wasn't as pretty as the cartoon. She was also a marvellous child actress.<br /><br />The scenery and setting was all the same as the cartoon. New bits and pieces were added at times but mostly, it was the same. I honestly have to say, this movie is a lot of fun for the family, although less cheerful than the cartoon but if you want to have a movie for your child to watch, buy the 1953 cartoon version. The music there had a very happy atmosphere.<br /><br />I suppose the dog was one of the best actors. I most appreciate animal actors. I mean, where could you get an actor dog? Really, the dog was hilarious.<br /><br />There were some long scenes that somehow dragged the movie a lot but anywho, it was still fun.<br /><br />Good for the family<br /><br />Kirstie Mabitad
B000BKVQTS|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. My poor, poor cousin purchased this movie after being pressured by her sister because we all wanted to see it so bad, and we sat there through about 30 minutes before we started cracking up hysterically after realizing just how bad it was. The movie follows the Brothers Grimm, who are fake witch hunters who end up getting forced into trying to find out why 12 girls have gone missing in a small little european town. Heath Ledger and Matt Damon give the weak characters there best and it is obvious that the main weakness of the film is the writing and the off-center humor that never seems to work. We were literally laughing so hard at some of the scenes, just in awe that someone had spent the time to write and create a lame movie like this. In one scene a man actually kicks a tiny little baby kitten into a spinning fan blade-with bloody gore splattering onto someones face...how is that for children?? Another nightmarishly bad scene was when a pile of goo attacks a little girls face and sucks it off of her head. She ends up running around with no face while the Gingerbread man chases her. We peed our pants laughing at this scene. Anyways, this movie is BAD. Please, don't waste your money on buying it. If you MUST, rent it...but, don't make a mistake and buy this awful movie on a whim. You will seriously regret it later.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is THE BEST Christmas movie.  Well acted performances by David Niven, Loretta Young, and Cary Grant.  David Niven plays a bishop who ignores his wife, daughter, and old friends, and compromises his principles to pursue the building of a grand cathedral. It takes an angel played by Cary Grant to teach him not only the true meaning of Christmas, but the true meaning of life and what is really important.
B00005ASOI|3.0|I picked up a copy of Suspiria at a local book store after hearing so many good things about it. I was expecting a polished, visually stunning horror film that would possibly scare the crap out of me. I was fairly dissapointed after watching this movie. The dvd quality seemed to be TV QUALITY at best which made watching this movie a painstaking task. The VERY thin plot revolves around a young american ballet student who travels to Europe to board at a private ballet academy. Little is revealed about the main character as she tumbles into a BEYOND confusing world of wicked happenings, and it is hard to form any emotional bond to her. The acting is absolutly awful and this movie supplies some of films worst conversations ever made. There is even a terrible scene where a poor blind man is mauled and killed by his own seeing eye dog!!!!! Who wrote that???? The opening death scene is supposedly one of horror's greatest scenes and that is somewhat understandable. A young girl is stabbed repeatedly (it even shows a shot of the knife slicing into her beating heart)and thrown through a stained glass ceiling window, with the shattering glass resulting in the murder of her friend. It is a visually disturbing scene that really made me squeamish. I think the movie mainly lacked a cohesive plotline and that is what took most of the glory of this film away from me. There were times during this film that I would just think, \\"What the hell is happening?!\\" I would have to say that the best part of the movie were the colors and the eerie and almost OVERLY loud synth styled theme music. I will give this movie three stars because of it's stylishness and atmoshpheric moments, but the plot is very poor. Jessica Harper made a great heroine too with her large doe eyed look and her lithe figure. I found it interesting that Dario Argento picked Ms. Harper because of her resemblance to SNOW WHITE, which I think is very true. Overall, if you decide to get this movie, make sure you are getting a digitally restored version and be prepared for a mind bogglingly confusing plot, but some great cinematic visuals.digitally restored version and be prepared for a mind bogglingly confusing plot, but some great cinematic visuals.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This is the best musical ever made and a great movie too.  Many musicals have great songs, but unfortuantely most of their story lines are all fluff and the characters are not very well defined or developed, just a prop against the song. BUT this movie not only has great music, but a good story, fun characters, well acted. Also the costumes the actors wear and the house and it's furnishings are eye candy--great to look at!  FANTASTIC MUSICAL!!! FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!!!
B00005JO1Y|5.0|First was Kong from 1933. I watched a long time ago and rewatched these days before entering the movies to see Peter Jackson's version. I also watched the 1976 version with an actor in a Kong suit when I was a kid. Then I came in a conclusion: Peter Jackon was mastering the masterpiece.<br /><br />There is the famous story of the first one here, mixed with some characteristics from the 1976 version, like the chorophorm. He really did an outsanding, fantastic job on here. An I even dare to say that Jackson's version surpasses the original one! Call this an heresy, but I think Jackson made the ultimate Kong movie! I went to the movies and watched 3 times so far, and I never get tired to watch it!<br /><br />Now I'm looking forward with good expectations for the DVD, while I keeps watching the original version here on DVD that I got in a local store that sells old rarities.<br /><br />Hail to the King!!!
0553801503|4.0|I just finished reading A Feast for Crows and shockingly, it was a struggle to complete.  There are obviously problems with this book.  The question, I think, is \\"why?\\" <br /> <br />One possibility is that, as Martin says, the book is merely one-half of a story broken into two (due to the physical limitations of publishing).  I'm not so sure about this.  Even if it is the case, then why does the story feel \\"padded\\"?  That's not necessarily the same as \\"poorly written\\" - but rather just \\"flabby\\".  I think we all know what I'm talking about - that school paper that you write because you have to.  You're up against a deadline and you have to deliver a certain number of words.  You can write, but you can't write with passion...and so you deliver a \\"product\\".  In the end, you hope that your teacher mistakes your ability to write for an ability to complete that particular assignment. <br /> <br />Sometimes it even works, especially when that teacher has no idea how great your papers can really be when you're truly inspired. <br /> <br />Still, I can't accept that this is all that's going on here.  Let's imagine, for example, what would happen if Martin were to complete this tale in 5 books - each one superbly written, judiciously edited and carefully crafted.  For one thing, I think that the series would be a best seller and that both he and his publisher would make a lot of money.  But, ask yourselves, aren't the shelves littered with authors who had one decent trilogy and were then abandoned by the public when their follow-ups proved to be less than riveting?  By contrast, isn't their more money to be made by stretching a once excellent series a few extra books and hoping that the \\"hard-core\\" buyers will continue to buy in the hopes that the writer will eventually rediscover the inspiration that once made the series so riveting?  Even if a certain percentage of readers abandon the series at some point along the way due to frustration, the loss of these purchasers will arguably be offset by the increased revenues generated by additional title releases within the series.   <br /> <br />As much as Martin is an artist, I have to believe that he is confronted with the same personal, professional and financial pressures that we all are.  Further, I think that he writes well enough that he hopes that most people won't mind too much. <br /> <br />In response to that, I have to give you a \\"B\\" on this assignment George,...not because it's not well written, not because I don't appreciate the realities of the publishing marketplace, not even if you had trouble finding the passion to pump this volume out, but because you and I both know that you can do a whole lot better... <br />
B00065GWK6|1.0|I think I may have cracked a smile once during the entire movie.  Napoleon Dynamite appears to have no real story line, but is more of a movie following the daily life of one dorky nerd.  Perhaps the only good thing about the movie were the actors -  I felt they did an excellent job.  All-in-all though, I'd have to say it was the worst $10 I've ever spent!
078681859X|5.0|A total enjoyment, I read this in a few days and enjoyed every aspect of it. The way Nat is transformed from a path of revenge to one of responsibility is an excellent example. Bartimaeus is true to his selfish character and the book being written from his perspective brings back visions of an autistic jinn ;) ( Curious incidnet .. for those who know.. ) <br /> <br />My 9 year old is now enjoying this book.
B0006957SA|5.0|I was first introduced to the Pogues by an alternative radio station, reporting on Margaret Thatcher's censorship of the Pogues--presumably because the band was supporting the Irish who were allegedly (wrongly) accused of terrorist acts against England. The song of the Birmingham 6 is really beautiful. It really stands alone.  And it's so different from the rest of the album which is so upbeat, wash-buckle rock! The lyrics are all nonetheless thoughtful and socially reflective. <br />Definitely recommended.
B0009VRHLK|2.0|Well, this is certainly much ado about practically nothing. As anybody who keeps up with the current cinema scene outside the \\"Sound of Music\\" type of offerings knows, \\"The Brown Bunny\\" is supposed to have one of the most controversial \\"live\\" sex scenes of any legitimate movie ever made. And perhaps it does. But if you are not careful you will have fallen asleep and will miss the \\"money shot,\\" since what causes all the consternation from the public occurs in the last 5 or 10 minutes of the film. It is also at this late date of this 90 minute film that that you find out what has been ailing the morose Bud Clay all along. He is mourning the lost of the love of his life Daisy (Chloe Sevigny), certainly a respectable subject for any work of art. She gets resurrected, of course, to perform the sex on Clay.<br /><br />The actors to a person mumble-- if they talk at all-- the first 10 minutes or so of the movie are about a motorcycle race with no dialogue at all. In much of the movie we see the director/actor Vincent Gallo driving across the U. S. with shot after shot of a closeup of his profile that covers about 1/3 of the screen. Then we have a section where all we see are the windshield wipers against out-of-focus rain. The camera often jumps as well. Even in so-called \\"art\\" films, shouldn't whoever is shooting have the technical skills necessary to do a professional job? This movie reminds me of something an acquaintance showed me he had made in a beginning film class. I was embarrassed when I watched the film since he was so proud of his creation and expected compliments. About the only good thing about the entire movie is the soundtrack, particularly the song by Gordon Lighfoot.<br /><br />Supposedly because of negative reviews after this film was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, Mr. Gallo edited it, thus producing a better Bunny. I cannot comprehend of a version worse than this one.<br /><br />This movie can be summed up in one word, boring.
0385335482|5.0|This book got me started in the 'chick-lit' genre, and for good reason.  I don't think I've ever laughed out loud in public while reading a book as many times as I did while I read this.  A few reviewers commented that this book is unrealistic.  Of course it is!  That is one of the best things about it.  You can't tell me you've never wanted to dump a bill at a construction site before opening it.  I LOVE Becky for actually doing it, her antics are charming and hilarious!  Kinsella is able to depict a wacky, resplendent, humorous, mult-faceted character that you can't help but love despite her contretemps. A GREAT READ!
0553062182|5.0|I found this book helpful and comforting.  Learning the information the book shares with readers and making adjustments in my life have all ready made a difference for me.<br /><br />I have learned that I'm not \\"\\"backward,\\" or \\"stupid\\" because I need more time and quiet in order to focus on what I'm doing or learning.  I'm not lazy because I require more sleep than most.  I'm not anti-social or strange because I often shut down when in a crowd, at a party, etc.  I'm not a wimp because I don't like confrontations or disarray.<br /><br />Being highly sensitive is not a negative - it is something I should respect and treasure.  If others don't get it, that's their problem, not mine.<br /><br />I've been much happier since I've read this book.  I'm very grateful for having found it.
0385338082|3.0|I read this book on a whim.  I went to the library for Confessions of a Shopaholic (which I wholeheartedly recommend) but it wasn't available so I checked out this.  It is just average.  It is a quick read, like all of Kinsella's works, but it is forgettable.  Not horrible, but not wonderful either.  The plot has its moments, but it is fairly predictable and slightly uninspired.  Those who are devout Kinsella followers should still read this book, but those who happen across it by chance, as I did, should keep going.
B00081H018|3.0|The first half of this book went by very slowly. So slowly, in fact, that I almost put it down.  I was glad that I didn't in the end.  The plot starts to pick up and the reader gets engaged in the final resolution. It's not the most clever or best written book I've ever read but it was certainly ok.  I bought it on the bargain shelf and felt it was worth it - decent entertainment for a few hours time.
0385338686|4.0|It seems as though every book I read in this genre features an overworked attorney disappointed with her job.  Sometimes it is good (Something Blue), but many times it is boring and unoriginal.  That is not the case with this book.  In featuring a lawyer who 'falls from grace' in an emotional and honest manner Kinsella spices up the overworked formula and produces a wonderful, memorable dish.  The relationships Samantha develops are as sacred and warm as the transformation Samantha endures as the book progresses.  What she takes from each of these relationships is noteworthy, we would all benefit in heeding many of the lessons Samantha learns from Iris, Nathaniel, Eddie, and even Trish. <br /> <br />My only point of contention is Samantha Sweeting's arrival to the setting of the bulk of the story.  I don't want to give it away, let's just say it is less than realsitic.  Otherwise, a great read!
B000BNTM96|5.0|Simply put, the best musical DVD I have ever watched.  The production values are great.  The sound is great.  The extras are great.  The setlist is great.  I have always wanted to see QOTSA live, but they keep skipping my area.  This DVD was just the fix I needed.  Of coarse every song has a little extra jam that you cannot find on the studio albums.  <br /> <br />QOTSA really did a nice job on this DVD, so plese do not copy it from someone else.  Go out and purchase it.
0385510454|1.0|I have enjoyed past Grisham books and think he has a talent of creating suspense. <br /> <br />This book however is trash after it has fermented.  The author always puts himself to some extent in the book.  The problem is he writes about learning a Italian and how great the expresso is and when to order, what to say in Italian.  Learning a language should never dominate a book like this.   <br /> <br />Shame on John for trying to pawn his boring life onto us.  This is what happens to writers who have too much money and time, they become boring. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money.  This book won't even work as toilet paper on a camping trip.
B00003CXAW|5.0|But you know one thing nobody ever considers? Maybe Kong got really tired climbing the Empire State Building. Maybe it took a lot of the fight out of him.
0446310786|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the greatest books ever written. I love how the characters seem like real people, like people you've known all your lives. Harper did a great job in showing the point of view of a tomboyish girl called Scout who is just realizing the horrible secrets of her town and discovers more than she wanted to. This is a book everyone can relate to. If you haven't read this book go find a copy and read it now!!!!!!!!! I promise you'll love it as much as I do.
B000002UAX|5.0|I am not going to be like every other person and say that Sgt. Pepper's... is the best. I have been a Beatles fan for over 30 years now, and I own almost anything that has to do with the band. I'm old... what can I possibly say. And I am glad that their are teenagers that are listening to the Beatles and not what the modern generation call music. But thats a whole other argument. Its just great to see that kids actually appreciate good, classic rock nowadays then ever before. Sorry for my random rambling on the modern generation; now onto the actual album. <br /> <br />The White Album is on of the Beatles greatest albums. Most of these songs are greaat, and classics like \\"Dear Prudence\\" contain this album. Even if you are a casual Beatles fan, then you must own this album, just because it is one of the best albums they have ever released. But, I am not going to say that it is better than \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\", because honestly it is not. That album is their best, in my opinion. But, thats just my opinion. <br /> <br />If you are just starting to get into The Beatles (where the hell have you been all your life?) then I would definately recommend a greatest hits album, and if you like them, move on to The White Album and Sgt. Pepper's. If you do not like those two albums, then just forget about being a Beatles fan, because you wont like anything else. I hope this was helpful... Happy New Year!
B00005JLWN|5.0|The action in this futuristic parable on censorship (of mind, body, and perhaps soul) is by far the best I've seen in a long time. The idea of gun katas is genius and inspired and Christian Bale was obviously tapped to be the next batman after someone saw this film. Sure the future world isn't perfect, as several critics pointed out, but then again it is a parable NOT a REAL view of the future. So if you go in looking for a good action/drama/parable then you will definitely enjoy this one.
0316857750|1.0|Kiyosaki is correct saying that schools don't teach money skills, and that much of what we buy (eg. cars, boats) are poor investments because of the immediate and substantial depreciation upon purchase. (Kiyosaki is reported to own seven cars.)<br /><br />However, to also state that an owner-occupied home is a liability (incur taxes, repair, and other costs), not an asset, is going too far. An owner-occupied home may be the only \\"asset\\" that allows personal enjoyment and substantial appreciation gains at the same time. (Kiyosaki bought a $1.2 million Phoenix home in 1999.)  Further, unlike owning rentals, it has a much lower risk of serious damage from irresponsible occupants. True one does become exposed to the risk of losing one's home if one becomes overextended; however, many have lost money on rental properties also - forcing unplanned early selling because of various inherent problems. And once one reaches retirement age, the home can be reverse-mortgaged and provide a good supplemental retirement income.<br /><br />The author's bias is towards buying rental properties. However, this \\"business\\" is one that has been sold for years by others (eg. Allen), and I've always wondered why, if the business was really so good, they would want to focus on teaching others to become additional competitors bidding up acquisition prices to unrealistic levels, instead of quietly doing it themselves. The \\"business model\\" quickly becomes overcrowded and infeasible, and is vulnerable to market downturns when one is heavily mortgaged.<br /><br />\\"Rich Dad/Poor Dad\\" also suggests buying stocks, but the methodology is simplistic, at best - move money in and out of stocks per your broker's recommendations on what is going up.  Another approach is to buy shares in a company before it goes public - my understanding is that one has to either be an insider or know an insider well to do this.<br /><br />Kiyosaki also makes a big point about wage-earners constantly paying taxes and increasing expenditures at a rate equal or greater than income. Unfortunately, he forgets to mention that wage-earners have an increasing number of means to reduce taxes (eg. Keogh and IRA plans), and those deriving income from investments are just as vulnerable to becoming over-committed financially as wage-earners.<br /><br />The other problem I had with the book is that it is too verbose - taking entirely too long to make a very few points. Perhaps that was the point - to drag it out so that readers wouldn't realize how little they were getting. Apparently this is not new - a 2/2003 article in SmartMoney states that Kiyosaki's seminar was comprised by 2 hours 55 minutes of general nothings, followed by five minutes outlining the basic mathematics of a leveraged real estate deal.<br /><br />Other sources report that this book spent 124 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list - the only reason I can think of for this happening is that it ended up being sponsored by Amway.  I'd suggest \\"Millionaire Mind,\\" or anything by Suze Orman instead.al or greater than income.

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|As a lover of the old Greek/Roman epics it was good to see a modern one.  This movie isn't much different from the old Hollywood versions so I won't quibble with the story changes to the Iliad.  However to make it work the acting has to be stellar.  Eric Bana delivers but Bloom and especially Pitt don't add a lot to the movie.  I wanted to like Pitt, he clearly took the part seriously and worked at it.  However I found is acting wooden and his character uninteresting.  Bloom didn't show the charisma that would make Helen run away with him.  The fight scenes were stages well and the scenery was magnificent.  Too bad the lead couldn't make the story compelling.

B0000AK7AA|4.0|You would think Casper would just be a silly little film that only a child could possibly love.  Surprisingly, though, it's actually a very entertaining film that even manages to produce a poignant moment or two in between scenes of regular hilarity.  The fact that Christina Ricci is in the movie doesn't hurt either - that's the main reason I wanted to see it.  The whole cast is actually quite good, even Bill Pullman (who I'm grudgingly beginning to halfway like for some crazy reason - and yes, you do get one of those vintage Pullman turnaround shots before the movie ends).  The non-human characters really steal the show, though, as Casper's uncles Stinkie, Stretch, and Fatso are a real hoot and steal every scene they're in.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, you've got this old abandoned mansion in Maine where Casper lives with his three obnoxious uncles.  Casper is of course quite lonely, and his uncles will not tolerate humans at all.  Then the old dude who owns the condemned place dies and leaves the house to his greedy daughter Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty), who comes running in search of a hidden treasure.  She and her friend/partner in crime (Eric Idle) don't last more than a few seconds in the house.  With a little secret encouragement from Casper, however, Carrigan finds out about a ghost shrink named Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) and invites him to the house.  Casper is overjoyed because he has a potential new friend in Harvey's daughter Kat (Christina Ricci).  There are several little subplots that play out rather well, but it's mainly just a matter of sitting back and letting all the ghostly hi-jinx work their magic.  That's not to say the movie isn't sad at times, as you can't help but feel sorry for poor lonely Casper.<br /><br />I thought the animation and digital effects were done really well; it would have been so easy to go way over the top, but ILM knows what they are doing.  It can't be easy to work with characters you can't even see (except via their stand-ins during filming), but I found the interaction between ghosts and humans to be very natural and believable.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|Peter Jackson has made a dual love story here -- Kong and Ann, of course, but just as surely New York and 1933.  That's why, for me at least, all the fabulous graphics work on Skull Island is largely wasted.  The scenes are vivid, nearly constant, and in one or two cases (think man-eating giant slugs) not at all for the squeamish.  This film earned its PG-13 rating.  Parents of impressionable kids below that age should not bring their children to it unless they are prepared to be sleeping with them at night for a few weeks.   <br /> <br />But most of all the stay on the island -- and the journey to reach it -- are just plain long.  I want to get back to New York, to hear some dialogue again (don't miss the throwaway homage to the original when Jack Black is searching for his female lead), to revel in the billboard and Broadway recreations, and to see the King and Ann atop the Empire State building as \\"beautiful\\" dawns over the city and its waters.  That's when this story really becomes something not to be missed.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|I hated the first half hour of \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\\" I thought it was quite boring, with scares that just didn't come off and acting that wasn't very impressive. I thought, \\"Hey, this movie exists to remind us how great 'The Exorcist' was.\\" Imagine my surprise when, after that first thirty minutes, I was on the edge of my seat, in the grip of a fascinating story.<br /><br />\\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" tells the story of a girl (Jennifer Carpenter) who dies after an exorcism performed by Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson). Moore is brought to trial for negligent homicide. The attorney for the prosecution (Campbell Scott) argues that Emily was suffering from epilepsy and psychosis, and that Father Moore was directly responsible for her death. Erin Bruner, the attorney for the defense, elects to argue the unthinkable, that Emily Rose was actually possessed by demons.<br /><br />First of all, the film combines two genres that are massively entertaining, horror and courtroom drama. The heart of the movie is in the courtroom, and those scenes tingle with suspense. The sequences of Emily's possession and exorcism are told in flashback, and I must admit that the latter is very disturbing. The cinematography is very atmospheric, especially when the film is set on the bleak farm where Emily lives.<br /><br />Second of all, the acting is very superlative. At first, I was wondering if this might be the first bad performance Laura Linney has ever given. Then I realized that she was giving a great one. Erin Bruner, \\"a woman of doubt\\" who does not believe in demons, is simply not a good lawyer. She gets by on luck and her passion, and she knows that. There are also moments when Linney lets us see the inner fear that haunts Bruner, and its these tony moments that make her great. Campbell Scott is absolutely wonderful as Ethan Thomas, the prosecuting attorney. Scott makes the character so despicably mean-spirited that you hate his guts, but you also know that he is a capable lawyer who really believes in what he's doing. Tom Wilkinson does a very solid job as the accused Father Moore, whose conviction never wavers. And finally, Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose gives a performance of great suffering and double-jointedness. Her possession, or is it epilepsy, is painful to watch, and always totally convincing.<br /><br />\\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is a gripping and extremely well made thought-provoking film. It combines legal fireworks with supernatural ones, and the mix is unique and completely successful. I genuinely believe that this movie will, in time, be regarded as a classic.e lawyer who really believes in what he's doing.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Pros: <br /> <br />- top-notch cast AND supporting actors <br />- brilliant writing <br />- VERY BRILLIANT directing: nothing is glazed over for TV's sake. If the bad guy is trying to incapacitate the good guy, he'll hit him in the head to knock him out. Then hit him several more times to make sure the job is done. Most everything looks like it was done with a handheld camera - it feels like it's real and you're there. <br /> <br />Fox will someday go out of business, and we'll laugh at them for cancelling such great shows. But at least we can enjoy 14 of the best episodes of television that have ever been made on DVD.

The small per-episode stories are moderately captivating, but the main story running through the whole series is what kept me glued to my computer watching this show...that and Kristen Bell's exceptionally seamless acting. <br /> <br />Ich empfehle
0385510438|5.0|I don't always love Grisham -- but this book is wonderful. Not all crime story; but a wonderful tale of a small southern town that has been sort of left out of the civil rights movement, and one young reporter who finds friends, a family to love, a mission, and a fortune. It is just great.

This CD is more likely a Daron Malakian solo album serj has almost no point in being a vocalist and most of every song is just guitar leaving John and Shavo with almost no purpose either.    Attack-6/10 its an alrite song serj is back-up of course    Dreaming-9/10 serj has more of a voice in this song    Kill Rock N' Roll-7/10 it's about half and half vocal wise    Hypnotize-5/10 definetelysh*t this has probably the most boring guitar of all time and daron sings with each breath like he needs to be 10 times louder than everything    Stealing Society-7/10 not much can be said about this song its  good    Tentative-6/10 not very good kinda good chorus    U-fig-9/10 funny lyrics    Holy Mountains-10/10 serj sings    Vicinity of Obcenity-11/10 all about ppie lol serj sings    She's Like Heroin-12/10 daron sings but its the best song on the cd    Lonely day-6/10 crappy music writin best lyrics \\"and if u go i wanna go wit u, and if you die i wanna die wit u\\"    Soldier Side-9/10 good stuff
0679720200|3.0|Camus captures the nihilistic, narcissistic mindset of 20th century man hauntingly, simply, and without apology. His protagonist Meursault is a man with very little thought beyond his own physical comfort or discomfort.  His reflections rarely even go deep enough to ascertain his own motivations and feelings, much less those of others.  The only time real emotion is elicited from him is when a priest visits him and urges him to believe in God, in an afterlife, in something more and with purpose.  Meursault suddenly snaps and begins shouting.  Finally something has touched his soul, which had been untouched by love for his mother, the love of his girlfriend, or the murder of a man. <br /> <br />The Stranger is a modern classic and those who wish to call themselves well-read should read it for that reason alone.  To become a classic, however, it had to reach deeper, to address some basic human thought or motivation.  In this case, Camus shows us the end result of a philosophy that sees no hope, no direction, no point to life or the things associated with it.  This is nihilism, and it leaves us despairing -- and glad to close the cover on the book and know that we are not nihilists.
0876855575|5.0|This being the first book I ever read of Bukowski's, was the one that made me fall in love with him and his writing. It took me on a literary journey into a beautiful, sad, intelligent landscape that drove me to set higher standards for other writers.  This story felt very real, I hated him and loved him and felt sorry for him...the imagery was so perfect I was there all the time.  I felt everything and could empathize and understand the core of his actions and thoughts.  The first paragraph hooked me and kept me intrigued until the last page and left me wanting more.  I have now been on the hunt for all his books,not to sure I am really into the poetry, but still would love to own them for fear I may miss something incredible if I don't.
B000002GQE|5.0|In search of a more \\"successful\\"  musical chord, the Moody Blues ditched their blue suits and brum beat style of music, and this concept album was their huge breakthrough years ago.  When Justin Hayward and John Lodge replaced Denny Laine and Clint Warwick, the group retreated into hibernation, and developed a personal and unique musical style all their own.  The result of this venture was \\"Days Of Future Passed\\", and the Moodies were then on their way to becoming one of the beloved rock bands of all time.  And today, they still are!<br /><br />A musical storyteller of the day and life of one person (it could just as well have been me or you), The Moodies, with the assistance of long-time producer Tony Clarke (often called \\"the sixth Moody\\") weave a magical spell of light rock and orchestration that has never been duplicated since this album initially was released in 1967.  The timeless classics \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" and \\"Nights in White Satin\\" plus other self-penned songs from the band, blended with the occasional flourishes of orchestration make listening to this album enjoyable over and over again.  So what if you can't dance to it?  People listen to music more than they dance to it, and although \\"Nights\\" is perhaps the only song you could dance to on the album, it does make for a wonderful number to slow dance with the one you love to close out a romantic evening.<br /><br />Although major hit-making albums for the Moody Blues may have long since passed, this landmark album is a must for anyone remotely familiar with their music.<br /><br />Now how about getting these guys inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame??? LONG OVERDUE!!!
B00008CMR6|4.0|Not that it's bad, of course.  Fans of the Duke will want to add \\"Rio Lobo\\" to their collection because it's classic John Wayne stuff.  This time, the Duke is a Yankee Colonel who attempts to track down a pair of Union traitors responsible for the theft of Union gold shipments during the Civil Was and ultimately, the death of a Yankee Lieutenant who was like a son to Wayne's character in the movie.  Along the way, he is aided by a pair of Rebs (Jorge Rivero and Chris Mitchum) and beautiful Jennifer O'Neill.  The quartet find themselves facing overwhelming odds (don't they always?) as they attempt to get the bad guy, while at the same time helping the oppressed citizens of Rio Lobo.<br /><br />Director Howard Hawks sticks to his tried-and-true (and successful) formula and puts together a fast-moving, action-filled film.  OK, so the acting (especially poor Jennifer O'Neill) is stilted, but viewers of this film didn't go to it (or get the DVD) because they were looking for Oscar calibre' performances.<br /><br />It's pure Duke with copious amounts of gunfire, self-depreciating humor and great Western scenery.  The film score ranks with some of the best work done by Jerry Goldsmith.  Hawks uses his patented clipped dialogue to keep the plot moving.  The supporting cast, including Victor French, Mike Henry, David Huddleston and Western veterans Jim Davis and Jack Elam, are great components to the film.<br /><br />If you enjoyed any of the aforementioned Duke classics, then you'll enjoy \\"Rio Lobo\\"
0312979479|5.0|Agatha Christie's \\"And Then There Were None\\" is a superbly written mystery in the whodunit mode. It is invigorating how she is able to intertwine the ten characters, and suspects, within the novel and tie everything together. I also thought the ending was rather unexpected and made for a fantastic murder mystery.<br /><br />Ten people, all of whom have shady pasts, are all summoned to a private island known as Indian Island. Once they arrive their host, Mr. Owens, is no where to be found. A curious nursery rhyme about 10 little Indians is left behind in some of the rooms, and then an even more curious message is played to the guests by the butler, accusing all 10 people of murder in one form or another. From here, people begin to be plucked off one by one, and as the bodies mount, the secrets become revealed and more and more suspicion arises from the guests. Pay attention to the nursery rhyme at the very beginning of the story, as it is an intricate part of the story's plot. It was ingenious how Christie's develops the ending, especially those final three chapters.<br /><br />If you are a fan of mystery and suspense, and love to play the role of detective as you read, then this will be a unique read. It is also a very easy, quick read, as the pages just seem to fly by. I was quite impressed with this novel, and it certainly makes me want to check out more Agatha Christie novels.
B000BKDOCA|1.0|When you put this CD into your computer, it installs software that damages the security of your computer.

You will be mesmerized, hypnotized and amazed.  The music is out of this world.  They couldn't have selected more fitting music.  Goblin almost IS this movie!!  Go and buy it!!  This is digitally mastered and looks beautiful.  BUY IT NOW!  I promise you won't be disappointed.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Started to watch this movie with a great expectations & so did my dear wife. How could Bruce Willis fall downstairs to star in a goofy movie like Sin City. That Hollywood  is more than goofy, everybody knows that, esp. us, \\"old timers\\" who saw in their younger years good old King Kong, Gone with the Wind, Ben Hur & James Steward in any of his movies. It seems to me like good actors take anything that comes their way as they one by one have been loosing their acting careers and stand in an unemployment line unless they belong to a so called \\"minority!\\" If I were an actor of Bruce Willis's type, I would get together w/other top caliber actors & create a \\"new Hollywood\\" company without those 4 letter words & sexual perversity. People or public is just dying to see real good movies. And, I must add, those cartoons for kids could really use also some redoing too - nice looking characters & not monstreous & ugly looking faces of kids & people. Is it, maybe & only for the reason to accept ugliness?? Sin City? It's a sin to even spend a dime to watch it. Carl Hodek
B000062YAZ|5.0|Of course everyone has heard Reign in Blood. Once you have heard it, you will certainly have an opinion on it, and this album certainly is one that causes strong ones.  <br />   On the surface, this is brutal speed/death metal with the atypical \\"evil\\" lyrics that come along with (most) of the genre. Some people bash Slayer and get up on a pedestal, saying the lyrics are \\"stupid,\\" and my favorite, \\"its impossible to distinguish from song to song.\\" I'll admit, Slayer's lyrics aren't the most original. I sometimes find myself laughing as I listen to Altar of Sacrifice, Necrophobic,etc., realizing the words I'm mouthing are flat-out ridiculous. Yet, I'm fine with it. For most other bands it would turn me off, but for Slayer they fit perfectly. In all truth, they are quite vivid and delivered with apparent sincerity. I think that you need to listen to them with a grain of salt and not take them too seriously. A band trying to act tough and scary is going to fall flat on their faces. Slayer seems to pull it off.  <br />    Regarding the guitar/drums (bass is not much of a factor here), the speed is ridiculous. The distortion for someone not really into metal will also be astonishing. But being the fastest or the heaviest doesn't make an album great. At the time it might have been, but it has been surpassed in extremity long ago.  <br />    So what is it that draws me to Slayer and this album? Pretty much all of the other speed metal bands I used to listened too have kind of been forgotten. Yet not a day goes by when I don't listen to them. Their lyrics may be somewhat corny, Tom Araya may not be the best \\"singer\\", and the all-out, un-ceasing speed on this album (not on laters) may be repetitive, but I still love this album. I realize its shortcomings, but I still always find a place for it. Listenable in its entirety, listenable with just one song (see Angel of Death, Postmortem, Raining Blood), this album is a memorable classic. Everyone has their favorite Slayer album (mine being Season's), but this album is special. Its a cliche, but this album is a MUST-HAVE.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|What's going on with these EMI guys?, I almost sold my LD version of Pulse (not as complete as this promised DVD)...
0553573403|5.0|Ok, now that I have given the one word review, let me go a little more in depth.  I have been a fantasy and sci-fi junky for a long time.  I have been extremely disappointed with a one Robert Jordan the last several books and needed a new fantasy fix.  Fortunately, some other disgruntled Jordan fans pointed me to George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.  Let me tell you I am glad Jordan has sucked and I found his author.<br /><br />Martin introduces the reader to the Black Watch and The Others in the prologue.  After the prologue, each chapter of the book focuses on one of the main characters of the book.  There are a lot of them, but this is a good thing.<br /><br />Each character chapter has three things in common: it 1) advances the plot through a different perspective, 2) it lets you learn more about the character's history, and 3) lets you learn about characters that don't have chapters told through their eyes (Jaime, Robert Baratheon, Varys, Littlefinger, ect.).<br /><br />Another aspect about this book that makes it such an excellent read is the complexity of the people.  Martin does a good job making the good guys good and the bad guys bad without being one dimensional, which is a trap that other fantasy writers fall into.  There are a lot of twists and turns and ambiguities.  People that you really cared for have painful things happen to them and their families.  People you aren't so sure about can do good things.  It is all woven into an exciting tapestry that really kept me guessing.<br /><br />The plot is kept moving along at a perfect pace.  Lets face it, Tolkien had a lot of stuff that slowed down the plot and don't even get me started about Jordan.  This book definately doesn't drag the reader along.<br /><br />I am not sure what else to say except this is one of the best books I have ever read in the fantasy genre.  It is powerful, brutal, revealing and above all entertaining.  I would glady recommend it to anyone needed to find a new fantasy author.nd a new fantasy author.
B000006AXE|4.0|This is the 'March of the Penguins' for a displaced group of Canadian geese, the flight of the birds.  Developers' heavy machinery scared the geese away from their nesting area at a lake on the property beside the home of a young girl played by Anna Paquin and her unconventional dad (a long haired Jeff Daniels).  Amy moved the abandoned eggs to their barn and kept them warm with electric light bulbs.  When the baby geese hatch out, they looked like Easter chicks, and she becomes their adopted mother.    Since geese learn everything from their parents, from eating to flying (and where to fly), there is a problem.  When her dad remarked that it was amazing how they follow her about like that, the local deputy said it was called 'imprinting.'  He told them that the birds are possession of the Crown and tries to clip their wings; he's promptly ushered off their land, but he kept watch looking for his chance.     They used to be declared an endangered species by the Wildlife Agency in America, but no more.  Animal Management can relocate a flock from one place to another.  I too had a group of geese who adopted me as their mother about three years ago.  But my pleas to the Wildlife Agency were in vain; the maintenance man at the apartment complex was allowed to harrass the group and shoot bottle rockets to hit them.    As the fifteen birds grew up, looking now like their parents, and spreading their wings (losing the yellow downy feathers), Amy also started to grow up and learned to adjust to the loss of her mother.  While her dad and his friends work to perfect an experimental bi-plane (a glider with an engine), Amy devoted her time and devotion to her feathered friends, giving them names.  \\"My geese are not going to have anything to do with your crazy ideas.\\"  They need to be shown how and where to migrate to the South for their own survival, out of harm's way.  They use the bi-plane to show the grown geese how to fly.  It seemed so perfect.    The birds always returned to Amy's protection and so she did a daredevil stunt on her own to make sure they would follow her.   She learned to maneuver a flying machine sabotaged as a large goose so as to be able to lead them away.  The whole flock \\"flew the coup,\\" leaving behind Igor, the one with the damaged wing.  Of mine, the male leader had a crippled leg; I called him Jack because he was so ornery sometimes when the flock left him behind.  One day Igor attempted to join the flight but an accident caused them to leave the others unprotected while they searched for Igor.  The deputy abducts the other fourteen.       A flight plan had already been mapped out to start on October 22, to get them in place by November 1st.  They will fly to Lake Ontario, then to Pennsylvania over the Appalachians, on to Maryland, and settle on the Virginia Shores, a four-day trip.   Amy is their leader after the dramatic rescue from the Animal Management's imprisonment.  They caused quite a commotion with aviation radar and security at the border in New York.  An entire military base was put on the alert because of the birds, with Igor riding in Amy's backpack while the others soar to freedom.    Along the way, the flock (or gaggle) followed a huge group of wild geese into danger as it was open season at the ponds and lakes in America.  Because of the New York television publicity about this project, an old lady with a gun at the pond where they'd landed came to their aid; soon, they are airborne again.    They caused havoc in the office buildings of downtown Baltimore as they glide a bit off course.  Amy is on her own for the last thirty miles after ther father's plane crashed.  The ground crew had gone on ahead and lost contact.  \\"Fare the well, my own true love\\" was like one of Sharyn McCrumb's Appalachian ballads, played as they landed at their destination, a new home for Amy's birds.  Truly a miracle -- this old movie (new to me) was much better than 'March of the Penguins' anytime.

B000000OA6|5.0|I purchased this album the day it was released, as I always did when new Queen music was available. It begins with the magnificent \\"Innuendo\\" one of Queen's best. \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" is a funny, but in retrospect sad song about Freddie's health at the time. \\"Headlong\\" is a straight up rocker as only Queen can do it. \\"I Can't Live With You\\" is an amusing song that will grow on you. \\"Don't Try So Hard\\" is a chilling song that seems to talk to you individually. \\"Ride The Wild Wind\\" is like going on a musical motorcycle ride. \\"All God's People\\" is a gorgeous song that makes you feel closer to God. \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\" is a touching song that makes you appreciate the simple things while you can. \\"\\"Delilah\\" really gets to me because I can imagine how Freddie felt when he wrote it. \\"The Hitman\\" is one more chance for Brian to prove he is the king of the guitar. \\"Bijou\\" is one of those musical moments that are hard to put into words. It is just beautiful to listen to. \\"The Show Must Go On\\" is the best song in rock and roll history. I still can't hardly listen to it without getting teary eyed. A farewell song that is majestic and heart wrenching. If you need proof of Queen and Freddie Mercury's genius this album will do.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|I was pleased by In The Mood For Love's visuals and such.  2046 is obviously a much bigger production, and there is so much more of everything I liked about the first movie.  This is one of the best looking movies I've ever seen.  The 60s Asian places, clothes, and people look really cool, and the colors are saturated and beautiful. <br /> <br />In \\"Mood\\", Chow lets his own honor keep him from starting a romance with the woman he truly loves.  2046 picks up with Chow changed by the experience in the first movie.  Now he's a cynical womanizing bastard with a little moustache.  He's way cooler now. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled by the name or the opening sequence.  This isn't a scifi movie.  This is the continuation of Chow's life.  Most of the movie takes place in Hong Kong in the 1960s.  There is a segment of the movie in which Chow writes a story that takes place on that futuristic train.  The futuristic part is a visualization of a story Chow writes.  And it is very cool, but different from the rest of this very cool movie. <br /> <br />See this movie if you enjoy stunning visuals and badass characters more than you enjoy clear stories that go somewhere.  This movie ends at a place not much more appropriate than any other part in the movie.  Watching it was just so enjoyable that I wanted it to keep going for another hour.

0440237688|5.0|As someone else stated, the concept and plot of this book has been mentioned many times, so I will not cover that area. I will simply explain why I love this book, and why I would recommend it to others.<br /><br />I simply fell in love with this book in the sixth grade. We were required to read it, and we were supposed to read a chapter a night - I read mine in a few days. Now mind you, that was over 10 years ago. I have since read it a handful of times, and each time, I draw different conclusions. I love that the book always leaves me wanting more; always leaves me imagining what would happen next; and always leaves me envisioning myself in the World it creates.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, including young adults all the way up to the elderly. It gives you a greater appreciation for things you would normally take for granted - like colors, emotions, and freedom to choose what to do with your life. I would also recommend seeing the movie equilibrium, or reading the book 1984 if you enjoy this quick and easy read. It's a more adult view of the same concept - a World with no emotions, no war, no pain, and sadly, no love.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|I'll start by saying that I loved the original Willie Wonka and Wilder's performance (although I'm not a big Gene Wilder fan).  So much of the original charm of the movie was removed and replaced with Burton's tradmark \\"darkness\\" and special effects.  Burton and Depp did not improve the movie one bit.  I watched the movies back to back and Depp cannot hold a candle to Wilder's performance.  Wilder is so complex--there is something so sinister, maniacle, yet loving about Wilder's Wonka.  I was definitely scratching my head at the scene's Burton decided to remove from the original movie (some of my favorites).  I wasn't expecting an exact remake of the original, but I didn't think they would remove some of the most charming scenes. For example, there is no fizzy-lifting pop and floating by Charlie and Grandpa (I remember that being the coolest and scariest part of the movie when I was young), he eliminated the scene where Charlie is stuffing his face full of chocolate after finding the coin in the street (which was used to purchase the bar with the ticket--that was such a meaningful scene where Charlie finally gets to be like the other kids who were overindulging in chocolate and not worrying that the money could have been used for food for his poor family--it was a such a pure response that most kids would have done.  The songs you identify the original film with are removed for techno/digital (and from my point of view--boring/blan) songs by digitally created oompa loompas...the Oompa Loompas (?) are also very disappointing.  It seems like the movie was PC'ized with respect to oompa loompa's replacing actors with digital recreations--it's sad.  The children are the same characters as the original film -- as such, you can't help but make comparisons between them.  In every case, except for maybe Violet, the original cast was better.  The original Veruca is untouchable--her performance was classic--you just can't match that brat!!  On a stand alone basis, the film wasokay.  However, if you are going to take on a remake of a great film --you need to withstand the comparisons and this film fails.  I recommend waiting for it on Cable or free tv..it's not worth cluttering up your dvd collection...(unless your a teenager swooning over Depp--which is obvious from some of the reviews).
B000A3DFZE|5.0|It does my heart good to see Clapton enjoying life, and this release reflects just that.  Do yourself a favor pick up this disc, listen without prejudice (sorry folks this isn't Layla), and enjoy life with him, you'll be glad you did.  God bless you Eric !!!!
1932907009|5.0|Finally one of Hollywood's finest spec writers put pen to paper and wrote a practical insightful book on the tricks of the craft, trade and insides of Hollywood's screenwriting business.  <br />Blake Snyder's \\"Save the Cat\\" is by far the best book I've read on screenwriting. Not only does \\"Save the Cat\\" unleash truth upon truth, Blake Snyder also paints those truths vividly making them easy to comprehend and to apply effectively time and time again (even for those non-academic cave men like myself).  <br />\\"Save the Cat\\" kicks off with four principles to create a killer logline and title from which the entire story unfolds. There's no excuse to run astray or loose the essence of your story ever again! These tricks will help you keep it clean and your head above water once you write \\"FADE IN\\".   <br />The greatest revelation was reserved for \\"Save the Cat's\\" close up on genre; the ten \\"story types\\". Story types cut across the board of genre. One story type can be told as drama, comedy, horror, thriller etc. etc. Blake shares the principles your story and its predecessors, of the same type, abide by. Discover why so many different movies are actually \\"the same thing only different\\": \\"Amadeus\\" and \\"Forest Gump\\", \\"Titanic\\", \\"Die Hard\\" and \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Spider Man\\" and \\"A Beautiful Mind\\". <br />After reading \\"Save the Cat\\", the most used tool in my writing box is the BS2, the Blake Snyder Beat Sheet. Blake's fifteen point beat sheet is the perfect tool to build a structure for your story and to conquer the dreaded Act II! Fair enough, you might yawn and say: \\"I already know the hero's journey\\". So do I. The BS2 is fresh, will open a whole new world of structure and give you plenty of ammo to write a story that works. Furthermore, it is practical and easy to apply. The BS2 is applicable to all movies that work, ranging from films like \\"Wedding Crashers\\" and \\"American Beauty\\" to \\"Casablanca\\". (I even applied it to the script of a spec commercial I recently shot and it came through with flying colors!) <br />\\"Save the Cat\\" provides the reader with a lesson in practical application of the use of 3x5 cards and the \\"board\\". Blake shares what crucial information of each scene should go onto the card and where to position crucial turning points on the board. Within a matter of days you can have your entire screenplay mapped out scene-by-scene on the board and be ready to write \\"FADE IN\\". <br />Finally Blake leaves us with the \\"immutable laws of screenplay physics\\" - covering principles like \\"Save the Cat\\", \\"The Pope in the Pool\\", \\"Covenant of the Arc\\" and many more - and a dozen thought-starters to problem fixing during re-writes. <br />\\"Save the Cat\\" is an invaluable tool for all professional, part-time and aspiring screenwriters, advertising agencies, directors, producers and storytellers. I give Blake Snyder's \\"Save the Cat\\" both thumbs up and a full hand of stars!
0307276902|5.0|The most appealing aspect of Frey's non-fiction(?) account of his rehabilitation from addiction is his enviable honesty. Frey's clear on who he is, what he's done & where he must go to get what he wants. He doesn't play games with himself or others. He has no patience with self illusion. He has no patience with others' illusions, and he isn't concerned with assisting others in maintaining those illusions.<br /><br />His rejection of Alcoholics Anonymous and of the concept of a higher power is thought-provoking, challenging and not entirely convincing.<br /><br />He rejects God in any form, yet the early stages of his recovery (a questionable word, since it suggests REcovery to something & for many of us addicts returning to anything we once were is the last thing that'll keep us sober) are significantly informed by the \\"Tao Te Ching,\\" a Taoist RELIGIOUS text.<br /><br />Sometimes Frey's very rejection of God itself rises to a level  suggestive of belief: He protests too much. But this isn't to criticize Frey--his candor is extremely thought-provoking and simply brave, given the likely reaction from much of the recovery community (some of it reflected elsewhere in these reviews).<br /><br />He rejects AA and the 12 steps, but in the period of recovery he describes in \\"Pieces\\" he appears to do pretty much everything a newcomer to AA would do. He in fact follows the program a great deal more assiduously than many who are actually TRYING to follow the program. He gains a remarkable degree of insight rapidly in his recovery (whether this is the insight he actually had at this stage in recovery or the insight he gained in the years before he sold the book is another question) & much of it's identical to things people say in some of the better AA meetings. Many of his insights are familiar to addicts in 12 step programs to the degree of being cliched.<br /><br />His rejection of religion, AA and steps seems to come down to a rejection of ORGANIZED religion, establishments, institutions & any structure he thinks others would impose on him. This is admirable, enviable, challenging &, at the same time, possibly to some degree illusory. Though he clearly doesn't use meetings, religious services, etc. to support his recovery, he does follow the same path as AA, down to having sponsors, though he never uses the word and assuredly would reject it. But he recruits others (notably, Leonard) to play roles identical to the sponsor's role.<br /><br />AA has problems, two of which are the impression some devotees give that it leads to religion (it might for some, but it certainly isn't a requirement) & the awkwardness with which the program often deals with drug addicts in a world where many of us are cross-addicted or dual-addicted & where for many (the majority?) of us under say 50, drug use went hand-in-hand with alcoholism. To tell a drug user they can only discuss alcohol is to send some right back out the door. Drug use is one of the issues that goes with alcoholism like divorce, debt, etc.<br /><br />I imagine Frey will enrage some & be denounced because of his attitude to AA. This is unfortunate. He offers a welcome, honest, useful perspective that deserves to be read, mulled over, discussed & debated.<br /><br />The book moves fast. The narrative techniques (no quotation marks, minimalized punctuation, esoteric capitalization, repetition) work beautifully for both the subject matter & the author's voice. It's as though Frey dispenses with quotation marks as he does with the rest of the social conventions he dismisses as worthless. It's Frey's iconoclastic nature that's so appealing.<br /><br />His account of addiction & the early stages of rehab rings entirely true to a fellow addict, even if the slickness of his narrative suggests CREATIVE nonfiction.<br /><br />His decision to save sharing some of his deeds until late in the book is an excellent trick. We like Frey & so are unable to dismiss him by the time he reveals the depths of hisslide in active addiction.<br /><br />His insistence on taking responsibility & rejecting the notion of disease or blame on anything or anyone other than himself is extremely appealing. Commendable, actually.<br /><br />One particular outcome in the book is heart-breaking, yet also so true of the world of addiction. Such a small percentage of us make it for sustained sobriety. Such beautiful people sometimes fail. It is heart-rending, & it is true.<br /><br />The book is compelling, fast-moving, at times breathtakingly well-written. The other characters are very well-developed. The (essential) first-person narrative works because Frey's good company. It wouldn't work were he irritating or unlikeable.<br /><br />At times profane, violent & explicit about drug abuse, \\"Pieces\\" isn't for the squeamish.<br /><br />The book led me to study the \\"Tao Te Ching\\" next, an outcome Frey would like. It's one of my favorite things, when reading one book leads to another.<br /><br />I mean no offense by this, but I was left wondering whether Frey is a sociopath, based largely on his lack of empathy, the way he seems to project his ideas about others onto them rather than actually seeing them for who they are & his iconoclasm. Maybe active addiction & early recovery is marked by sociopathy. Frey clearly is very intelligent, excellent about taking responsibility, at times a petulant child--in short, another flawed human.<br /><br />Myself, I'm conflicted on many issues surrounding recovery & Frey's book is an excellent resource for any addict who finds themself struggling with issues revolving around higher powers, steps, etc. because it contributes powerfully to the debate. To dismiss Frey's book as potentially harmful to the addict is to take just the kind of paternalistic attitude that reinforces the addict's alienation.<br /><br />Is it a good idea to give this book to an addict you know who's in the very early stages of recovery? On balance, probably not. Addiction kills & providing addicts with tools to help rationalize their excuses (which some might find in these pages) is probably not a good idea. But let's be in no doubt that this is a brilliantly executed, challenging piece of writing that deserves a wide audience. It's probably a must-read for addicts with some degree of comfort in recovery because of the questions it raises.

B0000C9ZLD|1.0|I admit it.  I began to buy into the media hype (Rolling Stone, Time Magazine, etc, etc) that these guys were going to save Rock and Roll.  One of the last \\"real\\" bands.  Well, if these guys are Rock's saviours then please, let it die and I'll just listen to the old good stuff.  This album is a bore with a capital B.  The lyrics aren't smart, the musicianship is good, not great and the singer, well I guess he tries too hard.  Their swagger seems concocted (no new incarnation of the Stones or even Oasis here).  I can't even imagine how boring these guys must be live.  Please, don't buy this CD and maybe the Strokes will have the good taste to just go away.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I watched this on a recommendation from my sister.  I'll have to talk to her. <br />This movie was a disjointed collection of little relationships, none of which really had any magic or interest.  There were random relationships thrown about without any real underlying theme or story.  Many of the interactions were just plain stupid.  And why the porno stars having on-screen naked intercourse and oral sex?  Love Actually is a typical example of an attempt to pull together popular actors and actresses in a weak movie.  I'm glad we only rented it.  I definitely wouldn't recommend it.
B000002A3T|5.0|Ok, if you stand it up against Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here, it comes up short.  But compared to the other music being produced in early to mid 1990s this album is one of the best of the decade.  Inventive, interesting, listenable, moving and dynamic, these old British guys (less the other old British guy Roger Waters)make an awesome album.  Gilmore's playing is still unique- no one else can quite capture his phrasing and tone.  If you want to own the 10 best Rock albums from the 90s this is one of them.
076790592X|5.0|A characteristic of a good story is that a character changes over time. In \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" there are two characters that go through a transformation while their lives coalesce like the twisted pair of DNA. Back and forth conversations of a dying teacher named Morrie and his once and again student Mitch Albom, the author, reminisce the dialogue standard of story telling of the ancients to teach a moral: the moral of forgiveness.<br /><br />Morrie Schwartz, the full name of the sociology teacher, who had taught at the Brandeis University for several decades, lived an active life of teaching, loving his wife and his own children, and dancing, until one day when he was struck with Lou Gehrig's disease. A fatal disease of the nervous system that works its way up from the feet all the way to the brain, killing its victim through torturous and sad journey to the end of life. But ideas live forever, and the idea Morrie had was to recruit his student sixteen years ago to write a book, which came to be \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", that chronicled the thoughts of a wise and dying man, himself.<br /><br />Although the book is short (a mere 192 pages with lots of space between lines and words) there is enough material to provoke thought and appreciation of the human life. While Morrie and Albom discuss myriad matters of life, one pervasive yet sometimes subtle element of the story's fabric is about the act of forgiving. Morrie did not live a perfect life. As wise he had been he realizes many mistakes he had made, but none of which as egregious as the one about not forgiving: Holding a grudge. Why do we do this? Morrie asks.
0515125024|4.0|Strong characters, excellent dialogue and non-stop, albeit very violent, action combine to make this a fast, entertaining read.  I'd categorize this as a perfect airplane book-a great book in which to escape for a few hours, but not one you're likely to collect or reread.
B0000256RB|5.0|There is no doubt that Arjen Lucassen could easily earn a living from the creativity in his writing alone but this album is pleasantly different and well articulated with the music; his canvas (and that`s another story all together). Disc one is slightly mellower with a bit of a psychedelic aura to it. Deep Purple anyone? Whilst Disc two delivers a harder punch and a little more diverse sound, with some dark elements even, so I do find myself playing it more often, a lot more often.     I find this to be a project based on a series of varied ingredients, both musical and lyrical. The depth of meaning behind EVERY track is incredibly satisfying and authentic. Regardless of how irrational the story might be at a first glance, it is dressed in a graceful faade and with a larger than life message anywhere you look at it.       \\"...Our hope's dissolved  for man's evolved into another state of being  have we \\"progressed\\" beyond the need of feeling?    A cyber-brain  the last in the chain of man/machine allience  have we become the victims of our science?    Evil devolution  is this an illusion  out here in space    Human humiliation  this mutation  of our human race    Is this the end  will we transcend the need for human pleasures?  will we abandon all our earthly treasures?    Will mankind yield  on the battlefield of natural selection  to an inorganic digital perfection?    Human humiliation  this mutation  of our human race...\\"      ...and this is what real music is about. Not just about creating groovy riffs (more than often mass-produced to satisfy our prostituted-market) but to construct legacies and congregations that will transcend to greater reasoning and further generations, here you embrace its sovereignty and will fear all mediocrity sh*t-albeit imitations possess.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|I don't have this remastered version, but have the one disc version. I will come back to write a full review, but have a question? I've had all the studio albums of Jethro Tull, so I would like to know where the songs &quot;Conundrum&quot; and &quot;Quatrain&quot; come from. I'm pretty sure they aren't on any of their studio albums, unless I'm forgetting about them. If they are new songs that they never had put on any of their albums, I don't want to hear them, but would like to hear a couple of their better tunes instead. I'll probably have to get this remaster because I've heard that it sounds a lot better than the issue that I have. I wish that they would have recorded it right after the &quot;Songs from the wood&quot; album and not after the &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; album, because they would have probably got to put on a couple of more from SONGS, or maybe they could have got a couple other classics fitted on the disc. If you are a Tull fan, you need not hesitate, because this is one of the better live rock albums (arguably the best) you will ever hear. Enjoy!!!
B000683VI4|5.0|Oh, what a story!  <br /> <br />I had no idea what I was getting myself into...there are just not enough kleenex for this movie, which I saw at the theater. At least 20 people emerged from it red-eyed and I (not usually being one for this variety of sappy) cried all the way home. Then I cried later, and then the next day. Sweetest love story ever.  <br /> <br />After seeing the movie I then read the book. It was one of the rare few where the movie was better!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Suddenly, I am obsessed with a four year old show that was cancelled after 14 episodes.  So are my kids.  And my husband.  Why is it that so much crap makes it onto television and theatre screens and this film wasn't somehow more successful?  Universal, Joss Whedon, actors and crew of Firefly, don't give up--this DVD is selling like crazy and you are slowly by word of mouth building an audience from people like me, who missed this gem the first time around.  Don't give up! I don't give a crap about Wonder Woman, Joss.  Firefly is where your energy should be directed.
B000AMJDHY|2.0|its hard to find a more cliche poppy rock band out there right now. Oh yeah i forgot this one has a synth in it.... and it still sucks.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|If what the credits say on the sleeve is true that Mayer played guitars on all tracks except the last one, then Mayer is really an excellent guitarist! If you listen to track 2 Good Love Is On Its Way, it's no easy task to sing and pluck out those great guitar licks at the same time. I am a Mayer fan and I know I am going to get alot of heat from the non-believers for saying this but Mayer truly has the guts to try out the new territories in blues and done it well. Hear the track on Something's Missing and you know its vintage Mayer on good old rock n roll with the audience going wild in the background.  You'll somehow arrive at the conclusion that he is at that stage of his career that he wants to experiment on new sounds and I give him credit for his bravery.     I've got everything the man puts out so far and I've watched his career going well. For me, Try! may not be his best work but as the name of the album suggest, he's trying things out. Keep it up John, most of us will be keen to watch how your career develops going forward.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Being a browncoat for a long while after seeing the TV series definitely got me hyped up about this movie! I wasn't able to see it in theaters so I immediately took a chance and pre-ordered this Dvd just the same as I did with the series (see my review for Firefly)! Finally seeing this movie, I was overly impressed with Joss Whedon's storytelling ability and the homely feel I felt when I saw my firefly.  <br /> <br /> First of all, for those who expected this movie to be another episode of the Tv series, it's not. What Whedon did with this movie is bring in old concepts he had for the series that FOX axed. For example, some who had seen the series complained about the darkness of Mal Reynold's attitude, as opposed to the lighter side of him on the series. Whedon always said that his initial take on him was to be a dark character, but because he was under FOX's wing, he had to lighten him up per their orders. I totally get that, and actually seeing the darker side of him in this movie made me like him even MORE than in the series. So basically, I'm saying expect the much of the oldness of the series, but don't be turned off to the newness. If you see the movie in a sort of symbiosis, you'll find the movie way more enjoyable... <br /> <br />  To the newbies reading this, if you haven't seen the series, it won't hamper you from understanding the movie. Actually, I've heard of many first seeing the movie and liking it so much that they went and bought the series afterwards. Don't be afraid to take a chance with Serenity - you'll be glad you did! <br /> <br /> All in all, a beautiful space western that deserved to have its story told. Trust me, in a sea of constant horror movies and chick flicks - not to mention all those action flicks that were all flashy lights with no substance - this one was truly a breath of fresh air. Take Serenity in...and breathe deep...
B00008H2LB|5.0|well all i have to say about this cd is that it is in my oppinion, one of the best cds on earth. <br /> <br />breaking the habit is the most popular song on this album but not my favorite. I'm surprised the song \\"faint\\" doesn't get more credit. its in my oppinion the best song on there. <br /> <br />it was one of the best christmas presents that i have ever gotten. It's really great and has no song that I don't enjoy.
0062515675|1.0|Utter childish nonsense. The author dosen't seem to know the first thing about the search for spiritualilty or meaning . He just rehashes often repeated sayings and makes a fantastic story about some foolish lawyer who goes off to the himalayas in search of meaning. He meets himalayan sages who live in huts built of roses!. The women gurus wear pink sarees and white flowers in their heads! What is this if not a childish construct of paradise?    Its one of those instant things. Like instant coffee. It might perk up someone after a reading for a day or two. But it is no profound pool of wisdom. It dosen't come from an internal awakening that happened to an author. The kind of stories and \\"fast food\\" kind of spiritual wisdom presented here have been around for years. I fail to see what is new or original about it.     I am amazed there is still a market for this kind of pop spirituality.

One of the Club has a friendly relationship with Secret Service Agent Alex Ford, who is gradually drawn into the Club's efforts solve the murder without being eliminated themselves.  The story requires you to suspend credability at points but the characters and the observations on US-Arab relations make it well worthwhile.  It's a pageturner that's hard to put down.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Admittedly, I was one of those people who didn't give Firefly much of a chance when it first debuted.  Work among other things kept me from watching more than a handful of episodes before the abrupt cancelation, but what I did see had me intrigued.  At least, I'd figured I'd be able to catch up on enough reruns before the next season started to fully understand what was going on.  Obviously that was a bad plan on my part, so thank god someone wised up and decided to put this series out on DVD.   <br /> <br />The acting is stellar, which is surprising considering, with the exception of Adam Baldwin, Gina Torres, and Alan Tudyk, I'd never heard of most of them.   <br /> <br />The slowly revealed plot of the series, as well as the individual episode storylines were all intriguing concepts as well. <br /> <br />The down side?  Television wasn't ready for a serial science fiction show when this came out.  We'd spent too many years raised on crap like Star Trek, whose storyline ended after an episode or two.  The only ongoing plot there was the Star Trek franchise. Firefly was more for a thinking audience. <br /> <br />It's too bad that Fox television chose to pull the plug so early on this show, leastwise without giving it much of a chance.  If the success of the DVD sales was enough to launch the movie Serenity, maybe the success of Serenity will spawn some sequels.
0786889284|4.0|Fires of extreme ferocity are literally vaporizing women in Seattle.  This is no ordinary arson - it burns so hot that there is almost no evidence to examine and the means of setting the fires cannot be determined.  Lou Boldt, Seattle Homocide, and Daphne Matthews, forensic psychologist, are at their best.  Very intriguing mystery that will keep you reading carefully until the end.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Or, at least it is one of my favorite movies of all time. Everybody is cast very well, and I guess this is just one of those movies where you just love them to death, and I certainly do. This movie has everything you could want from the genre: Comedy, mystery, peculiarness, CGI effects, and beautiful sets. I just can't quite explain \\"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory\\" because it already seems to do everything for itself when you watch it.  <br /> <br /> <br />Johnny Depp is very well cast as the suspicious Willy Wonka who has been a recluse for 15 years in his chocolate factory. That's another glorious thing about Tim Burton's films is that they normally revolve around outsiders that are much different than they appear, but that's besides the point. Tim Burton is my favorite director and I think this movie was perfectly done, and I'm probably one out of few people who love both movie versions of the book. Deep Roy plays the oompa-loompas all by himself and performs their songs well in dance and tune, also. They all sound very different from each other, but maybe they're supposed to. I actually haven't read the entire book myself but I have skimmed through it a couple of times and it resembled both movies to me, and most people have compared at how close this was to it, but I don't really care. This is just one of my favorites out of many movies that are my favs, and I will continue to love it as much as I do now and might even grow to keep loving it even more. You just have to see it to believe it.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|How can someone write a review saying how \\"crappy\\" an album is with out backing up their opinion? This is one of those cds that when you first hear it, it sounds a little too much like the very annoying Fall Out Boy, but as you listen more and more, you notice huge differences, especially in lyrics. It really sucks when a band like Fall Out Boy has huge talent in everything except that the lyrics just whine and complain, thank God, Panic! fixed that problem for a truly indie, catchy, near perfect album.
0553801503|3.0|In the five years since the third volume in his _Song of Ice and Fire_ saga, George R. R. Martin has become the most popular and most respected author in epic fantasy.  This fanfare has attracted expectations and scrutiny to the fourth volume, _A Feast for Crows_.  _Feast_ does continue the saga in Martin's uniquely brilliant style, but it suffers from an expanded scope and an incomplete cast of characters. <br /> <br />As Martin remarks in the Afterward, his planned story for this book grew too long, so he kept back half his cast of characters for the next book.  _A Feast for Crows_ includes such point-of-view characters as Jaime and Cersei Lannister in King's Landing and Sansa Stark in the Eyrie.  However, it does not feature many of the most popular characters like Jon Snow on the Wall, Tyrion in exile, and Daenerys across the sea. <br /> <br />After the frenetic tone of the last two novels detailing the war, the slower pace of peacetime events in _A Feast for Crows_ feels welcome.  Yet only half of the plot threads continue the general thrust of the previous novels--the struggle between the Houses of Lannister and Stark, within the war for the throne.  The other threads cover new, peripheral plotlines such as the political machinations in Dorne and the Iron Islands.  These locales simmer with Martin's trademark vivid descriptions and detailed world-building, but the lack of familiar characters and the rotating points-of-view in the same locale make these two plotlines feel disjointed. <br /> <br />With so many point-of-view characters in the saga, it's inevitable that the plots for some will move faster than others.  Martin doesn't write chapters where little happens, so the characters with slower-moving plotlines end up with only three or four chapters in the whole book.  These unfortunately include almost all of the remaining point-of-view characters from the previous book.  Here, _A Feast for Crows_ clearly suffers from the decision to hold back half the characters. <br /> <br />The scope of the _Ice and Fire_ saga has widened with every book.  Sadly, this expansion has shifted the focus away from the initial characters--the Stark family.  _A Feast for Crows_ does include one sign of the epic scope possibly starting to narrow--several factions seeking to find Daenerys across the sea.  Hopefully this consolidation of plot threads will continue as Martin moves through the proposed next three books to the conclusion of the saga.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The Serenity movie was a movie I saw  accidentally last September. One of those sunday afternoon when nothing is showing in the cinema that you either haven't seen already or you have no interest in seeing. Anyhow...Serenity got rave reviews and as a science fiction writer/publisher and lifetime fan I had to see what everyone was talking about. NOTE: I'll admit that I abhor and detest ALL COMMERCIAL/NON-SCIENCE Soap Opera/Sci-Fi fiction entertainment like Star Wars, Star Trek, Babylon 5, Stargate and almost every movie/sitcom/garbage that has been ejected from the SciFi channel. I enjoy psychological sci-fi like the Outer Limits, Twilight Zone, etc... or hardcore Sci-fi like Space Odysey 2001, Aliens, Dark City, BladeRunner, 2046, I even enjoy comedies like the MST3000 series.<br /><br />But Serenity as a movie blew everything I'd seen before it away.<br /><br />This movie wedges a new genre into the sci-fi space opera type; Call it sci-fi western! It is well written, directed, acted and produced. If there is any gripes from the mindless masses is that the movie did not suffer from the guady overstaged over production of the StarWars sagas that movie goers today seem to suckle on as if poorly scripted battlefield scenes of non-developed characters and a go-nowhere plot is the sweet milk of artistic movie production.<br /><br />Serenity succeeds because it out does every recent Star Wars episode with far far far less. Five or Six main scrappy characters, chugging thru space on a ship that is the equivalent of 1970 beat up old Pinto at a 2005 Ferrari car show.<br /><br />At throw in some real plot, good acting, good-evil tension (in the very modern sense where everything is grey and not painted black and white like commercial sci-fi), a novel&working concept of western drama meets intergalactic space and a good script and you got the awesome movie that is Serenity.<br /><br />Since then I've bought the FireFly dvds and discovered that Joss Wheadon and his amazing cast are very talented.<br /><br />Good stuff all the way thru.<br /><br />Get it.> <br />Good stuff all the way thru. <br />Get it.
0679422714|5.0|Mao was a bad guy.  Very simple.  Over 70 million people died because of him.    If you are a communist sympathizer, if you are a quote \\"intellectual\\", if you are a university professor who thinks they know more than everyone else, you will not like this book.  You will probably tell people the book is no good.    If you want to read a very reader friendly, accurate, truthfull biography of Mao, you will like this book.    I recently saw on C-Span the authors of the book giving a speech at Havard and it was so sad to see some of the academia and the \\"intellectuals\\" try to attack the authors and defend Mao.  As the authors point out in the book, very few of the communist leadership were actually workers.  And Mao was no exception, as are his modern academic apologists.  Jung Chang lived through the Mao years, check out Wild Swans, and knows first hand what a totalitarian dictator Mao was, it was said to watch American academics challenge someone who was actually their.    There have been other books on Mao.  In my opinion this was the best biography on Mao since the slightly dated \\"China's New Emperors.\\"  Short's biography on Mao was boring and really dry and afraid to take a stand on Mao.  You do not need to be politically correct with a guy like Mao, he was a bad guy and Short is afraid to say so.  Spence, the so called \\"China guru\\" wrote a short biography of Mao, but who can read that.  Much like his other stuff, Spence writes for the Columbia University crowd and not the average reader.    Mao the unknown story uses many different sources from many different places to talk about Mao and his life and policies.  The authors also know how to write which makes the book very readable and offers access to the average reader.  This tends to scare those in academia.  Look at the reaction people like Ambrose or McCullough would get...the \\"intellectual\\" crowd never likes authors who make history interesting for the masses.    The book does a great job showing how Mao rose to power and the negative affects of his policies.    I suggest reading Wild Swans first and then if you are still interested in learning about China then move onto this book.  I also suggest Orville Schell's \\"Mandate of Heaven\\" which is in my opinion one of the best books on modern China.    I am all for biographies that show the good and the bad sides of people.  Look at Manchesters incredible biography of MacArthur.  But I do not like books that are so politically correct that they won't glorify those that should be glorfied and they won't villify those that need to be villified.  The authors clearly show what Mao really was.
B0002F6AZC|5.0|The raft story with the teenagers was so scary it stayed in my mind for years after.  I don't know what it was about this one short segment of Creepshow 2, but let me say, it was quick, it was brutal, and it was clever.  I feel bad saying it, after all, people work hard and spend a lot of budget money to bring us all these modern scares, but this one simple, frightening, story sticks to your mind.
B000AOEN2C|4.0|I have enjoyed watching TNG, Voyager, and Enterprise. I am now convinced that Star Trek is far more interesting than Star Wars thanks to Enterprise.  Season 3 of Enterprise in undoubtedly some of the best story-telling, directing, acting I have ever seen on the small screen (5 stars!!). My compliments and thanks!! Perhaps if the Trek movies were made more along these lines of creativity and skill, they wouldn't have fallen way short of fan-expectations (ie. Insurrection, Nemesis, Star Trek 1,5).  Perhaps instead of concentrating in North America, the producers should try reaching a more international/global audience (half of the income from Star Wars comes from outside N.America).  Also, I don't think Trip died just yet, Hollywood has ways of resurrecting the dead (see Planet of the Apes original).  He could have just missed the conference because of his condition.  I certainly didn't see the rest of the bridge crew \\"miss-him-because-he-was-dead\\" while at the conference if he was really dead.  I would also like to add, that I really liked Cmdr \\"Shran\\" the Andorian aside from the rest of the regular Enterprise crew.  He has the best and funniest one-liners. Anyway, do give this series a chance, I for one will give DS9 a chance too (I have yet to see more than 10 episodes of DS9) and certainly try to watch the original Kirk series (have only seen less than a handful).  I also wish the DVDs could be much more affordable  ($$500++ for a 7 season Trek show is way too much even for a Trek fan like myself, the wife would never approve).  The Enterprise introductory music isn't so bad, it's different and bold, but I got to like it after just few runs.  Just let the franchise rest a little, fans will welcome it back again I'm sure, once they realize it's been missing from their lives. I get Star Trek only once a week, and only Enterprise at 10pm on a Saturday, and a re-run of the same at 2:30am on a Sunday.  Some of you guys have all the luck and not know it.
B000AYQLX6|5.0|\\"Walls and Bridges\\", fue lanzado en 1974, en ese tiempo, John Lennon estaba en el \\"Lost weekend\\" y tambien distanciado de Yoko Ono, por su relacion con su secretaria May Pang.  En todo caso, John Lennon, lanza en mi opinion, uno de sus mejores trabajos. Temas como \\"Going down on love\\", \\"Old dirt road\\", \\"Steel and glass\\", son parte bastante personal de parte de Lennon. Tambien vienen los grandes exitos \\"Whatever gets you thru the night\\" (con Elton John y N 1 en USA) y \\"9 dream\\", que son temas totalmente clasicos. Casi al final, un tema totalmente epico que es \\"Nobody loves you when you're down and out\\", que para mi, pienso que es uno de los mejores temas que hizo John Lennon, a lo largo de su carrera. De todas maneras, es un gran disco, tal vez poco comprendido por algunos, pero de todas maneras muy recomendable.  La nueva caratula del disco es bastante graciosa e interesante, pero de todas maneras me quedo con la primera caratula. Un traspie, que en el diseño del CD, aparece la imagen de Yoko Ono, que en 1974 estaba totalmente alejada de Lennon, en ese entonces; realmente es algo muy raro.    Rating: 4.5 estrellas
6304076517|5.0|Shakespeare's play known as The Tempest is the most mysterious play one can imagine. Greenaway who is the most uncommon English filmmaker gives to the play a visual meaning that the text cannot have. He keeps the text, most of it, adds rather little to it, also keeps the characters, the situation, the period, and many other things. Yet the adaptation is extremely original because of the visual wrapping Greenaway adds to the play itself. First the style : baroque, modern baroque with loads and loads of visual elements and visual special effects. We are overwhelmed by them so that we end up not seeing the details. There are too many details. Hence we capture this visual spectacle as a ballet and we follow trhe general movement. The second element is of course the nudity of the actors and actresses. But since most of them are nude after a while it is not seen any more. Greenaway has in a way bared our own minds so that we have dropped all the preconceived ideas we may have and we can follow the show with virginal, or nearly virginal, or more virginal eyes. Greenaway insists then on two elements. The first one is on water, hence the tempest itself. This is quite in the tradition, just heavily present, including with inserting images in the main screen. Then Greenaway adds a visual element that gives a meaning and a semiological structure to the film : the books. And he also adds some presentation and commentary of these books. The meaning, as it seems to appear, is that books are the most human part of man and man can survive any treachery, any evil act if he is able to retain his books. The choice of books insist on science and knowledge. Books are the shrine in which humanity has invested and condensed its knowledge that is its power over the world and nature. But the strangest part is the end. After justice has prevailed and the Duke is back in his dukedom, he burns, along with his Ariel and other spirits, all the books, or rather he throws them into the water, the sea, the ocean where they burn. The meaning of that ending is not easy to imagine and any interpretation would be tentative and controversial. I lean towards thinking that this burning of his books by Prospero himself means that humanity can get to justice thanks to its accumulated knowledge but that books can die, because there will always be a new level of knowledge, a new generation that will write its own books. Losing books is not a catastrophe in other words. I am aware that this reading is optimistic, and that a very pessimistic reading is possible like books are useless. Justice is always the result of pure accidents and private interests. If circumstances are right one can expect to get some justice from one's fellow human beings. But the favorable circumstances are like a tempest : rare, unpredictable and destructive.

B000003FMY|5.0|What a treat for the ears!    The Living Stereo series was wonderful then and it's even better now. There are two releases of this album, this 2 channel CD and a hybrid SACD with both this CD's track and a 3 channel version, which is how it was originally recorded. If you have a player that can handle it, I strongly recommend you get the SACD.    Although this review used the hybrid SACD it applies to both.     This release has fantastic sound quality and, thankfully, is completely true to both music and the original recording. Originally recorded in \\"3 channel stereo\\" that's what you get here--no, there's nothing in the rear channels of the surround mix but that's exactly the way it should be. Taken directly from the nearly 50-year old (!) masters, the engineers did nothing at all to the sound except digitize and transfer each track to the SACD/CD master. Nothing added, nothing subtracted. And the quality of those masters is astounding--clear, bright and full. No tape hiss. No loss of highs. Just wonderful music expertly performed.     Dissapointed you're only getting 3 channels and not 5-7? Don't be. You'll hear the musicians arranged across the broad, but shallow, Chicago Symphony Hall just as the engineers heard them in the recording sessions in 1957. And those musicians are superb, particularly to my ears, the brass and woodwinds. This is an excellent orchestra caught at its prime.    In short, get this CD! Even if you don't have a universal player now, the 2 channel transfer is equally good, a faithful recreation of a classic LP. And if you can play the SACD layer so much the better because for the first time you'll hear exactly what was recorded and what the engineers heard in nearly 50 years ago.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|What can I tell you about this movie? Well, lets see.... upon leaving the theatre the one thought on my mind was \\"It could have been so much better.\\" It really had everything going for it, good actors, very good special effects and lets face it wonderful materal to work with. I really think that was part of the problem. Just too much material to work with. If the writers had just focused on fewer fairytales I think the movie would have flowed better than it did. The Brothers just tired to do too much and the movie ended up lost.<br />Now all that being said, I am talking about paying 9.00 to see it at the movies or buying it for 18. If you're going to rent this movie you should enjoy it very much.

B000BW7QWW|1.0|I'd heard good things about this one.  I stuck with it for almost an hour and gave up, which is very unusually for me.  I then read the Amazon reviews again and was convinced by how strong they were to give it another chance.  I stuck it out till the end, but I caan't recommend it to anyone.  Its hard to follow, and frankly boring compared to other sci-fi flix. I also found a few scenes suprisingly unsporting, e.g., when the hero shots badguys out of the blue. Not even a late night filler film for me.
B00000I07P|4.0|I got the remastered CD version of Slippery When Wet since I didn't want to wear out the cassette version.  The sound is so sharp and you can hear the lead guitars and drums quite clearly. <br />Slippery has lyrics that are a little cliched at times, but Jon Bon Jovi wrote from his experiences and life in many of these songs. Desmond Child and Richie Sambora wrote with Jon as well as the band.  But the album is full-blown arena rock at its loudest in the '80s. Let It Rock is so full of energy for all its 5 minutes, it should be the song to open up all their concerts, even for their latest album , Have a Nice Day.  It pairs well with their first #1, the danceable and sometimes funky You Give Love a Bad Name. Never Say Goodbye is a nice power ballad, sometimes sappy and would be perfect to play on prom nights today. Wanted Dead or Alive I still love today with its acoustic guitar leading to the big bombastic guitars in the song's middle.  But I don't want to leave out the other songs. There are some solid numbers with Social Disease, the big album closer Wild in The Streets (they danced to this a lot on the USA network's teen dance show Dance Party USA in mid-1987, which was taped in Philadelphia),Raise Your Hands, and my favorite, the charging I'd Die For You. It's New Jersey-based rock with the feel of being in a big arena with the band performing loud in front of 60,000 fans. That's how good this album sounds and that's why it's still one of my favorites out of my music collection! The album that the band took control of their music career and succeeded!  I still can't believe that it's sold over 12-15 million since '86!

044022425X|5.0|Diana's books take a long time to read. They are so rich and well developed that I like to savor each chapter. I received \\"The Outlandish Companion\\" as a gift while I was in the middle of \\"Drums of Autumn\\". It helped me immensely in understanding some of the Gaelic and other languages that are interspersed throughout the story. I only wish I had the \\"Companion\\" before I started reading the series. <br /> <br />Like the first three books, this one covers a lot of territory and introduces some more notable characters. The personalities of Briana, Roger, Lord John, and Ian are better developed in this book and they will hopefully provide us with more entertaining reading in the next. I am constantly amazed at the struggles that each day presented to Frasers & company during the 18th century. The perilous ocean travel, the thieves, the devastation from illnesses such as measles, not to mention the hard life in the wilderness. (The part with the snake in the privy really got my attention!) As in the other books, Diana doesn't sugar-coat any situation or any bodily function! <br /> <br />Jamie and Claire are truly partners and soul mates in every sense. I felt they became even closer in this book, if that is possible. I love Jamie's steadfastness and noble character. He becomes quickly initiated into the roll of father when he makes a truly human error in judgement pertaining to his daughter's virtue. The argument with Brianna & the estrangement that ensues seem very realistic. Claire has settled nicely into the roll of mother and country doctor. She is not as much of a firecracker as in previous books, but then again she is still remarkable for a middle-aged woman! <br /> <br />There are a few slow parts to this 800+ page book, but I never found it boring. I can find no reason to give this less than the 5 stars that it deserves.
B00062IDCO|5.0|Voyager got of to a shaky start, but the seventh and final season bubbles over with the magic that makes Star Trek the phenomena that it is. The series finally, \\"End Game I & II\\" is, for me, the best Star Trek story ever. Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) breaks stereotypes by being a powerful female leader who does not sacrifice her femininity in the process. She can be as diplomatic as Picard or as ruthless as Kirk without missing a beat. Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) discovers her humanity and proves again that women can be both beautiful and powerful. The Doctor (Robert Picardo, a truly gifted actor), who's character is a hologram, adds both comic relief and expands the definition of life itself. Testing the limits of the human potential is what makes Star Trek great and this season of Voyager shows us just how powerful, alluring, and compassionate humanity can be.
B00009ATIX|5.0|WARNING:  Solaris has a double twist/surprise element in it which definitely adds to the impact of the story.  This review doesn't give them away but others do.  If you don't know the story and want to watch this movie, you really shouldn't read some of the other reviews.  I strongly encourage any future reviewers to not give away any of the surprise elements!<br /><br />  I specifically looked up \\"Solaris\\" here on amazon to give it five stars because it's my favorite sci-fi film of all time.  I was staggered to find out it's a remake of a 1972 russian film of a polish book.  I'm definitely going to watch and read those.<br /><br />  It's perverse to call this a sci-fi film though, since it merely uses science as a means to an end which could have been achieved in any other suitably fantastic way.  I think in our day though it's especially appropriate to use science as that means.<br /><br />  I'm really not surprised at how extreme the reviews have been... some demanding 0 stars, others 5.  Criticisms include that it's slow or boring, and that it's emotionally inert or emotionless.  I think rather that this is a mood deliberately set to reflect the depression of the protagonist... he chooses to not feel because otherwise he would only feel pain.  His life is dull and hard after having been filled with a bright light of hope and love.  He moves slowly and deliberately in it with controlled motion... almost like a robot?  He's a bastion of strength, but he's hollow on the inside.  He's narcotized himself... he sleeps.<br /><br />  And then he awakens, metaphorically and literally, and the whole movie takes a radical new direction.  As soon as I saw what he did on his first awakening I was blown away.  Was that courage?  Was it fear?  Whatever it was, it was the first time he had reacted instead of just acted in years!  I don't know but something seemed so horribly right about it and it grabbed me!<br /><br />  The film is set on a space research station with only three living occupants... sort of.  It's dark, it's cold, it's metal, it's austere, it's floating alone in space orbiting a strange celestial phenomenon.  As a counterpoint to this, much of the film is told via flashbacks of Clooney's intimate, often very warm memories.  Also, almost every scene is filled with human bodies, especially human faces... of all objects, the one that most impresses itself on our memory.<br /><br />  The theme of (in)completeness and of what makes us complete is central to the film.  So too are the notions of dream and reality, and the question of which we are.  Also, the issues of the nature of representation/represented and the pervasiveness of the mental.  I fashion myself a panpsychist so I loved this.  Finally there's the issue of how to control is to destroy.  The whole film can be read as a battle between two basic urges... the one to control, guard against, or destroy; the other to surrendur, understand, and love.  Each urge is manifest in each character.  In the scientist the former is dominant (science as understanding but only via or for the sake of control?).  In Clooney, the latter is dominant.  In the pilot, the urges are mutually-annihilating, resulting in apathy.  I won't spoil it by telling you which urge wins.  (They both do in their way!)<br /><br />  As you may have gathered from this and other reviews, this is an unabashedly \\"philosophical\\" film... there's so much ground covered by it in so many ways so fast, with so much left unsaid or only hinted at that it's hard to take in at first.  When I finished watching Solaris for the first time I was just kind of quiet.  I didn't know how to characterize what I had seen.  I knew it was basically good but not much more.  But so many of the images and scenes and themes kept coming to me in the following weeks and months... I started thinking of how the film was doing or saying something that I had never realized before... that I eventually came to think it was really quite extraordinary.  Later viewings only reinforced this opinion.<br /><br />  You may end up completely uninterested in it.  Then again you may find that you have the capacity to really enjoy this film and find that you want to buy it to watch over and over again!  Either way, give it a try.<br /><br />  Final words:  \\"We don't have to think like that anymore.\\"reinforced this opinion.         You may end up completely uninterested in it.  Then again you may find that you have the capacity to really enjoy this film and find that you want to buy it to watch over and over again!  Either way, give it a try.

B000005RUG|5.0|I think it's fair to say that this was the album Metallica decided to try something new and cater to the masses a.k.a. sell-out.  It's also fair to say that their best ever albums are their 3rd (\\"Master of Puppets\\"), 2nd (\\"Ride the Lightning\\"), 4th (\\"And Justice For All\\") ones and in that order too.<br /><br />However, this the 5th album isn't all bad; as far as sell-outs go, this is actually very good.  \\"Enter Sandman\\" is a great track and has all the elements of one too: great slow intro buildup, great catchy riff, the necessary repetitive metal rhythm open low E string pedal bass, one heck of a brilliant guitar solo and a great ending.  For this brilliant track alone, I'd give this 5 stars but the other tracks are all also very good and most importantly while alienating many of their existing fan base, managed to gain many, many more crossover ones.<br /><br />This version comes in a very nice cardboard mini-lp sleeve replica package and with an extra track that's a nice have but not essential.  The sound quality is good but is NOT remastered and so isn't much better than the one you already have except for the fact that from my experience with many other cds the Japanese pressings almost always seem to sound better than the U.S. or any other country pressings for some reason.  I wonder if it's because they take better care and effort at mastering?<br /><br />You'll find that this is the case for all the other albums released in this format from Metallica.  Maybe, someday, they'll re-release all the albums in this format again BUT remastered for an improved sound.  However, even though this version of the \\"Black\\" album is not remastered, the sound quality is pretty decent and I'm happy with it which is a compliment because if you read my other reviews, you'll find that I have very little tolerance for badly mastered discs with poor sound quality and especially those that claim to be remastered.  I hate false and misleading advertising and I like to be sure that I get what I paid for as advertised.<br /><br />My recommendation: if you don't already have this given the high price just to get the mlps packaging and the fact that this is not remastered, you are better off not getting this version and holding on to the original that you have.  If you are new to Metallica and don't mind paying a premium for this, go ahead as although this is a sell-out compared to their better earlier albums, this is still a very, very good album and I highly recommend this album although not necessarily this high-priced version.to be sure that I get what I paid for as advertised.   <br /> <br />My recommendation: if you don't already have this given the high price just to get the mlps packaging and the fact that this is not remastered, you are better off not getting this version and holding on to the original that you have.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|I am in almost complete agreement with a previous review about the Eagles performing live in Australia. For example, I was frustrated when they eloquently performed \\"Take It to the Limit\\" and, ironically, defied logic by not getting off their granddaddy butts and TAKING IT TO THE LIMIT BY BELCHING OUT THE LAST PART OF THEIR CLASS SONG in high notes!<br /><br />However, when I saw the DVD for sale, just sitting there by itself on the shelf, I jumped off my own granddaddy butt and rediscovered California Gold.<br /><br />If anyone wants to hear the pure sound of California, the music of the Eagles is the direct pipeline. It is vibrant, regional and full of melody from the harmonious singing to the acoustical guitar strumming, horns and violin. In the old days, I remember when the Eagles had entire orchestras (more than one violin) and choirs performing with them.<br /><br />I was also delighted to watch them play \\"Already Gone.\\" In their previous live recordings, they seemed to always avoid playing that hit. Therefore, this song alone is worth the purchase. By the way, you must buy this DVD to watch their THRILLER performance of \\"All She Wants to Do Is Dance!\\" OUTSTANDING!<br /><br />The quality of the recording is totally excellent, the Aussies are radically excellent and the memories are mesmorizingly excellent. TAKE IT EASY!

B000BP86OG|2.0|The Darkness' first disk \\"Permission to Land\\" is a metal classic. In 2003 the music scene was devoid of any meaningful heavy metal bands. \\"Permission to Land\\", with its unabashedly loud riffs, searing guitar solos, and incredible falsetto voice from the lead singer was the best hard rock disc in decades. With one stroke of the sword The Darkness were metal heroes. It would take two years before their follow-up effort and frustrating is the word that springs to mind. On \\"One Way Ticket\\" there are glimpses of the band's brilliance but overall the disc sounds like another band is performing. <br /> <br />The Darkness have a new bass player and signed on Roy Thomas Baker to produce the disc. Baker, best known for his work with Queen, injects bombast and frills into his work. Rock is not about bombast and frills, it is about \\"Permission to Land\\" and the Hawkins brothers forgot this. What possesed them to incorporate strings, french horns, honky tonk piano, and opeartic choruses is beyond comprehension. But as the title of one of their songs declares it \\"Must Have Seemed a Good Idea at the Time\\". <br /> <br />\\"One Way Ticket\\", the title track and first song begins with a minute of chanting and flute. Yes a flute. The song finally kicks into gear and is a reasonable effort, despite the sitar-rather-than guitar solo. \\"Knockers\\" is the next track and has witty lyrics and an engaging slide guitar riff. However right when the song should have a kick ass solo we get a honky tonk piano and a 5 second solo. The third song does rock but after that it's as if the band fell off the face of the earth. \\"Lady Dinner Arms\\" is an attempt at a metal ballad, but it's replete with violins. At this point I began to realize that Justin Hawkins' vocals were getting overly multi-tracked, hence his falsetto sounded much less entertaining than on the first disc. The sixth song on the disc \\"Girl with the Hazel Eyes\\" epitomizes the frustration of this effort. The opening 45 seconds is a bizarre, oriental sounding synthesizer bit. It adds absolutely nothing, in fact its absolutely annoying. When the song starts to rock it becomes enjoyable. But again when a prolonged solo is badly needed we get a 10 second tease. \\"Bald\\" is the only song on this disk that sounds like it came out of \\"Permission to Land\\". It's a masterpiece about the guilty pleasure of a rival going bald. Just a flat out great song that's evidence that the band still has substantial talent. The last three songs are embarassing. The Darkness sound like just another big hair band, albeit with strings galore. \\"Blind Man\\" has no guitars in it, just piano. I don't think it will inspire many fans to hold up a Bic lighter. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm being a bit too hard on the band. But I listened to \\"Permission to Land\\" again yesterday and I almost wanted to cry. It's sooooooooooooooo good. And so frucking hard rock. Here's hoping The Darkness return to this planet. They will have permission to land.
B0002XDODU|4.0|this album is very solid, both musically and lyricly.  i love it up until ohne dich... thats wher eit kinda loses it for me. i loved mutter, it had a nice balance of heavy then slower then heavy, reise reise maintains that until the end then there is 3 slowish songs in a row. i dont mind the songs themselves, but maybe they could have been broken up a bit, possibly just change the tracklisting order.  all in all the songs are much more harmonic and musically advanced than on mutter with less of a synthesizer feel and more of an orchestrated feel. they also have a nice choir singing backup on a few tunes.  my favorite songs are mein teil and los, it has a strage sound to it. i quite enjoy it.  buy it.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|Being into MTV and TRL, I rarly listen to albums this good. Avril is probebly the greatest guitar player ever and she can easiely hang with the best. This album is a punk masterpiece. What more can I say, Avril is my favorite artist and this is her finest album. A must have.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The Cd is \\"Classical\\" favorites so the emphasis is not so much on emotions but rather on instrumentation and orchestration. These are all very exceptional and I guarantee satisfaction. Anyways, I am not a classical listener as far as radio stations go but my musical tastes vary dramatically. I found this album to be a phenomenal bang for the buck as I can, on occasion, listen to the classics of which I have heard and thoroughly enjoy listening to. This album has it all.......Mozart, Brahms, Chopin, Bach, Pagony, Tchaikovsky, etc. <br /> <br />I really like listening to this CD........ <br /> <br />Musical tastes vary dramatically which, if you think about it, is kind of ironic given that a CD is anywhere from 60-90 minutes and a book may take 3-5 hours to read but, for some reason, people tend to be socially grouped more by music than books. Just something to think about.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is a mesmerizing and epical movie directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back To The Future), and starring Tom Hanks (Big) as Forrest, Sally Field (Mrs. Doubtfire) as Forrest's mother, Robin Wright Penn (State Of Grace) as Jenny, Gary Sinise (Ransom) as Lt. Dan Taylor, and Mykelti Williamson (Heat) as Bubba.    Tom Hanks shines as the dim-witted southern simpleton named Forrest Gump who loves his country, his mother, and his only childhood friend Jenny, and that's about it.    The film follows Forrest through an inspiring journey from his childhood in the 50's through his college years and Vietnam in the 60's, to his admirably successful shrimping business venture and settling down with a family which concludes in the early 80's. And throughout this incredible journey, Forrest has no clue how great a person he is and becomes.     We get to share history as it unfolds with Forrest through the simple mind of Forrest himself. We get to meet different people who mark a significance in Forrest's life: his Vietnam buddy, an African American simpleton named Bubba, who constantly talks about shrimps and an interest in starting a shrimping business after the war, Forrest's superior officer in the war, Lt. Dan Taylor, who's saved by Forrest against his will and in the process loses both of his legs. On top of all that, we're amazed at how Forrest gets to meet three US presidents: John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon; and musical icons Elvis Presley and John Lennon, and make history as he becomes a state football champion, a national war hero, and America's ambassador to China as a ping pong player.    Forrest Gump will take you along on his thrilling, funny, and sometimes sad trip through his very simple but stunning life, and you will be unable to pull away from it, not even for a minute.     Another important feature in the film is the soundtrack which covers each period with the songs that defined the era.    Recommended    A
B00005JO1Y|4.0|First off, I have to list the things I did not like about this remake: <br /> <br />1) Too long. Peter Jackson seemed to have his brain on \\"Lord of the Rings\\" mode when making this. Either the editor was bribed or somehow forced to neglect his job, because many scenes should have been cut (they would make for some interesting deleted scenes though). Case in point: the romance between Adrien Brody and Naomi Watts. Was there a purpose to it? No. I don't mind a long movie, but I do mind pointless screen time. <br /> <br />2) Jack Black. Sorry Jack, you were miscast. Peter Jackson said in a recent interview that he casted Black mainly because his children are a fan of Black's. That's all cute and fuzzy, but what about the rest of us who have to witness him in the role? I like Jack Black actually, but he was way over his head here.  <br /> <br />3) Peter Jackson resorts to a lot of cliche. Group of cast members are able to escape being flattened to pancakes when having a marathon race with a bunch of dinosaurs. Young inexperienced rebellious castaway sneaks into the group after being told by tough-as-nails superior to stay away. Minor character is killed right away by island inhabitant yet major protagonist is saved at the last second from the same fate. Etc. <br /> <br />4) A plot hole big enough for Kong himself to jump through: how did they get Kong back to New York? As bad as the 1976 version was, at least they explained how Kong was transported back. So I guess in this version Kong was forced to swim to New York City at gunpoint. Or does Peter Jackson expect us to believe that they used that hunk o' junk ship to take him back? <br /> <br />5) Some scenes are insulting to the viewer's intelligence. Case in point, when tons of bugs are shot off Adrien Brody by a punk who's probably holding a machine gun for the first time in his life. Brody should have looked like a spaghetti strainer, but no, not one single shot! A suspension of disbelief is required for this type ofmovie, but this is laying it on just a little too thick. <br /> <br />What I liked about the movie: Everything else. Enough to give it 4/5 and purchase the DVD. And I didn't even mind the Central Park ice skating scene. <br /> <br />Naomi Watts carries the film and proves (yet again) that she's one of the top actresses we have. Fay Wray's shoes were hard to fill but she did it.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Titanic is possibly THE GREATEST movie in the history of EVER! I was crying (NOT because of Leo) but because this was a real event once upon a while ago, and even though the story of Jack and Rose is fictional, it is very well written and performed. Too all of you POO HEADS out there who gave this movie a bad rating, you can all SUCK EGGS because this is a heart-touching story about a real event. I suggest you read up on the real story to get the full effect, but this movie does perfectly well as a way of telling the story if you're too lazy to READ!  <br /> <br />     Documentaries SUCK...we all know that. But with a playful plotline that you can focus on that brings out the reality of this story, you get the full effect. Yes, this movie is three hours long, but you can't rush history. For all those who think this movie should be rated R, please keep this to yourselves. Back then, the human body was a beautiful thing. It still should be, and to some people it still is, but with our trashy world today, people think of the body as a thing to mess around with for a night. Jack respected Rose; TO ALL MEN AND LITTLE SMELLY CHILDREN: the scenes where they are together should be a message to all of you to GET YOUR HEADS ON STRAIGHT and start thinking the right way about the female body...it is NOT a toy! <br /> <br />     Yes, this is a long review and kind of a rant...but I think the point is WATCH THE FRICKIN' MOVIE! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />      <br />
B00005JKN9|3.0|Director:  Martin Scorsese <br />Cast:  Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, Henry Thomas, Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson, John C. Reilly, Gary Lewis, Stephen Graham. <br />Running Time:  166 minutes <br />Rated R for intense strong violence, sexuality/nudity and language. <br /> <br />\\"Gangs of New York\\", Martin Scorsese's epic that nearly never hit the big screen, begins when the year is 1846, and a clan of Irish immigrants, lead by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) have come to the deadliest part of the burgeoning New York City, the Five Corners, to battle with a madman named William Cutting, aka Bill The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), and his horde of Anglo-Saxon `natives.' When Priest Vallon is killed by William, his son Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) is sent away to an orphanage, and spends the next 16 years stewing in his plans for retribution. Arriving back at the Five Corners, Amsterdam plots his way to William, who now runs the city. Seeking help from all the individual gangs that creep and swindle around the streets, plus assistance from a pickpocket (Cameron Diaz) who has direct access to William, Amsterdam tries to overthrow the Butcher. And all the while, the city is bulging with the violence which will culminate in the draft riots of 1863. <br /> <br />Visually, the film is a masterpiece, offering some of the best cinematography, art direction and costume design of any film released in 2002. With the help of some master craftsmen, Scorcese has created a complete world unto itself, one that doesn't look quite like anything we have ever seen on film before. The setting provides a stunning mixture of the real and the surreal, with everything from the clapboard buildings to the foot-tall hats deriving their style from extrapolated exaggeration. It is truly an astonishing, eye-popping achievement; however the same cannot necessarily be said for the rest of the film.  Based on a story by former film critic Jay Cocks, the screenplay by Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan and Cocks himself never quite achieves the level of greatness promised by the setting. The main drawback is the story itself, which is basically just a trite revenge melodrama all gussied up in fancy period clothes. Leonardo DiCaprio takes center stage as Amsterdam Vallon, a young man who, as a boy, witnessed the murder of his father (Liam Neeson) at the hands of Bill `the Butcher' Cutting (played very well by Daniel Day-Lewis), the meanest man ever to terrorize the streets of this fledgling metropolis. Bill, who is an expert with knives and other cutting instruments, is the man all the denizens of the section of the city known as The Five Fingers fear, and he is able to use that fear to make himself undisputed king of the area. After a 16-year absence, Amsterdam returns to the scene of the crime, determined to even the score and make Bill pay for his offense with his life. <br /> <br />Despite the glories of the setting, Scorcese is never able to bring the story itself to life. Perhaps DiCaprio is just too weak and passive to make a very convincing foil for the hard-as-steel Bill Cutting (who seems heavily derived from Dickens' Bill Sikes character in \\"Oliver Twist\\", a literary source that never seems too far from the minds of the movie's authors). Perhaps Daniel-Day Lewis is just too convincing in the role of villain to make it seem like anything even close to an even match; perhaps, too, the obligatory romantic plot strand involving DiCaprio with a miscast Cameron Diaz is simply too hokey to fit into the grim tale being told here. Whatever the reason, the core of the film turns out to be the weakest element of \\"Gangs of New York\\".  Moreover, the dialogue is utterly banal and uninspired, consisting mainly of syrupy platitudes and half-baked philosophizing. Lucky for us, then, that the director has provided us with enough visual stimulation to keep us at least intrigued, if not quite fascinated, throughout.  What does fascinate us; however, is all the historical detail that permeates the outer fringes of the story. These include the ever-present backdrop of the Civil War, which keeps encroaching into the world these people inhabit, and the anti-war riots that tore virtually all of New York City apart, both of which the filmmakers use as a kind of macrocosmic comment on the petty battles and rivalries taking place in this hellish part of town. In moments like these, \\"Gangs of New York\\" almost touches greatness. Also of interest is the way in which the film highlights the fervid anti-immigration attitude that has so completely permeated the history of a country that, in a bewildering paradox, has always prided itself (in theory, at least, if not always in practice) on being the great `melting pot' for the world's downtrodden and disenfranchised to flock to - and the film reminds us of how prevalent that anti-immigrant attitude still is today in many quarters. Truly, some things never change. <br /> <br />In some ways, this film might make an interesting companion piece to Scorcese's \\"Casino\\", in that both films deal with the theme of lawlessness and corruption making way for legal conformity and respectability. Each of these works, so distant from one another in time and place, manages to portray the kind of epic birth pangs that cities and countries often have to go through before they can call themselves truly `civilized.' This theme is, undoubtedly, what led Scorcese to compose a kind of visual ode to New York City in his closing shot, his own personal valentine to a city that has suffered so much in the past few years. It is his way of saying that, from such squalid beginnings, New York City has grown into the great cultural center that it is today and that it can be proud of its heritage and the people who helped make it. After the events of 9/11, that is a very powerful and stirring sentiment indeed.  Yes, \\"Gangs of New York\\" is a severely flawed film in a lot of ways, but it is also a work ofvision and of almost unparalleled technical accomplishment that deserves to be seen. Even if there is not much here to engage the mind or the heart, you can always feast your eyes on the glorious visions unfolding up there on the screen.

B00009L1TA|2.0|Director:  John McTiernan <br />Cast:  John Travolta, Connie Nielsen, Samuel L. Jackson, Timothy Daly, Giovanni Ribisi, Brian Van Holt, Taye Diggs, Dash Mihok, Christian de la Fuente, Roselyn Sanchez, Harry Connick Jr. <br />Running Time:  98 minutes <br />Rated R for violence and language. <br /> <br />John McTiernan's (the mastermind behind \\"Die Hard\\") \\"Basic\\" opens up in a rain-drenched Panama jungle at night on an Army training mission headed by Sergeant West (Samuel L. Jackson). Flash forward to the next day. An Army chopper picks up two men from the training mission, one injured and one very much alive. The injured man, Kendall (Giovanni Ribisi), is sent to a hospital, and the alive man, Dunbar (Brian Van Holt) is sent in for questioning by the very sexy and very Southern Osborne (Connie Nielsen). Dunbar refuses to speak to anyone except a Ranger. So in comes Ranger Tom Hardy (John Travolta) to piece together the events surrounding the death of Sgt. West and his team.  Most of the film takes place at night, during a rainy hurricane, and adds to the nonexistent plot. What is so intriguing is that the plot isn't really there, but the writer tries to manifest one, and we feel as if we are staring at some nonexistant, material wad of words and flashbacks and images thrown together in a blender, the writer hoping for it to come out smelling of roses.   <br /> <br />The writer of \\"Basic\\", James Vanderbilt (whose screen crudentials consist of \\"Darkness Falls\\"), has so many twists and turns that the film is impossible to keep up with. It becomes hard to seperate present from past and what's real from what's not. So many revelations happen that the audience will feel they are in the middle of the writer's mind, as he comes up with new ideas and tries to squeeze them in time after time after time. There is a limit to how many times you can use \\"surprise\\" revelation endings. Vanderbilt uses three of four in a row, piled on top of each other, time after time after time. Just as we think the plot twists are done, and we start to smile because we think we might finally understand the basis of the plot, something else happens, and we zoom in suspensefully on John Travolta's face as he, along with the audience, realizes something.  The performances of Basic's cast are a mixed bag: Travolta is watchable as usual, and he brings a believable sense of self-assured cool to Hardy, but he is frustratingly unable to contain his hammy instincts. The quality of a Travolta performance appears to be inversely proportional to the volume of his voice.  When he's quiet, he's very good; when he yells, he quickly becomes a cartoon. This movie has enough credibility problems; it doesn't need a cartoon hero. <br /> <br />If Travolta is mixed news, Connie Nielsen is plain bad. It's not so much that she can't seem to make heads or tails of the convoluted story - heck, no one can. But she seems less to be stymied than just exceptionally stupid. The scenes that are supposed to establish romantic tension between her and Travolta fall laughably flat. To top it off, she is saddled with some Hollywood nimrod's notion of a Southern accent, which blinks on and off like a turn signal. The smaller roles, though, fare much better. Van Holt as the prisoner does especially well, flavoring his defiance with feral intelligence. There is also nice work by Taye Diggs as the unit's misfit and Tim Daly (where has he been since \\"Wings\\" folded?) as the base commander. The most memorable, though (and you sort of knew this already) is Jackson. He has the lunatic drill instructor bit down pat, and delivers it with relish. His is the one character in Basic who is supposed to be larger than life, in part because he is seen in flashback, which means that we are seeing not the man himself, but other people's impressions of him. In his commando sweater and poncho thrown over one shoulder like a warlord's cape, he looks twenty feet tall and invincible. Still, one of Jackson's great talents is his ability to project nuance and smarts to even the most unsubtle characters. His Sgt. West is the shadow leaning over the whole incident, and the movie would have been smart to take more advantage of that.  The real disappointment in the supporting cast is the normally talented Giovanni Ribisi as the wounded survivor, a hospital-ward weirdo who is supposed to seem mysterious but mostly comes off as jokey and annoying. Ribisi seems to have shoplifted his performance from Gary Oldman in \\"Hannibal\\", down to his marble-mouthed line deliveries. <br /> <br />Though \\"Basic\\" is shabbily conceived, it is at least presented well by John McTiernan, who manages to wring what tension may be had from the loopy script. The movie is lacking in the action set-pieces McTiernan usually employs, but he nails the atmosphere just right. The use of weather to convey emotion is certainly overdone, but it is still effective when done right, as it is here. The pounding, ever-present rain and the dim, shadow-tinged interior lighting gives the movie the feel of an approaching end, a kind of despairing resignation to horrible things. It's a shame that the drama can't keep up with its own visual metaphor.  It has its merits, but strains your suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point, and washes its credibility away like bloodstains in a rainstorm.

6304795254|3.0|Director:  David Fincher <br />Cast:  Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, James Rebhorn, Peter Donat, Carroll Baker, Anna Katarina, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Charles Martinet. <br />Running Time:  128 minutes <br />Rated R for language, and for some violence and sexuality. <br /> <br />Michael Douglas is on reliably good form as Nicholas Van Orton, a millionaire investment banker who lives in stately, joyless, isolated splendour in the mansion he inherited from his millionaire father. His father, Nicholas Van Orton Sr., died at 48 by hurling himself off the mansion's roof. Now having reached 48 himself, Nick, the man who has everything, is given an intriguing birthday gift by his rebellious younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn, sadly under-utilized here): an invitation to participate in a 'game' staged by the mysterious Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Their games involve the individual participant in a seemingly real-life scenario which blurs the edges between fact and fantasy, and which is deliberately tailored to suit each participant's personality. Reluctantly Nick signs up, as much out of boredom as anything else. It seems that for CRS, Nick's highly charged but emotionally austere and control-freakish personality calls for a high octane adventure in which he risks losing all control of events, and will thus be forced to depend on others for his physical, if not his psychological, salvation. And so the game begins.  Nick soon comes to doubt that he is playing any kind of game. Has he instead become the latest victim of a monumentally sophisticated scam? Or is it all a bad dream? Throughout this is all very gripping, and being a David Fincher (\\"Seven\\") film it has a dark atmospheric gloss which keeps you unpleasantly hooked; however, as the plot unfolds like a Chinese puzzle, the film gradually reveals itself to be pure surface. Despite Douglas essaying yet another hard-nosed anti-heroic establishment outsider with characteristic intensity, there is onlyan intermittent sense that Nick is in psychological rather than physical danger, even though this, underlined by the constant home-movie flashbacks to Van Orton Senior's demise, seems to be what's actually at stake. The lack of psychological menace in the film hinges on the fact that no other character in the film is properly developed, so no one really seems to carry any real threat. Perhaps the real threat to Nick is within himself, his own demons, which somehow the game is intended to help him exorcize. But it's questionable that this is what we actually see portrayed.  <br /> <br />The film is boistered by superb performances, including Douglas' best since \\"Wall Street\\". Deborah Kara Unger impresses as Christine, the waitress (or is she a waitress?), while Sean Penn is quite good at playing the somewhat spoiled and mouthy little brother. The script has wickedly funny dialogue and gives the film a slight \\"black comedy\\" feel. As usual in a Fincher film, the cinematography is dark and forebodding and creates a noir atmosphere of sorts. Howard Shore's music is excellent: Instead of attacking us with bombastic chords, a sound as simple as a piano tinkling is used to make our hearts race. The plotting is ingenious and one plot twist after another is instigated until the film creates a spider-web of fear and paranoia that has us mind-boggled. The films themes of redemption and paranoia are followed through right to the end in an ending that some think is supremely contrived.  Despite its pretentious packaging, the constant hints that we are watching a dark psychological thriller, a morality tale, 'The Game' turns out to be merely a well-executed action adventure that plays on the audience's paranoid fantasies, and it is to this end that Nicholas Van Orton seems ultimately to have been created by the film-makers.

B00003CXSP|2.0|Director:  Ridley Scott <br />Cast:  Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Giancarlo Giannini, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta, Frankie Faison, Francesca Neri, Zeljko Ivanek, Hazelle Goodman. <br />Running Time:  131 minutes <br />Rated R for strong gruesome violence, some nudity and language. <br /> <br />When \\"Hannibal\\" was in the process of being made, it seemed like it was going to be a thrilling exciting follow up to the Oscar-winning, highly acclaimed \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\".  Hopkins was back as Lector, Ray Liotta was to play the obnoxious Paul Krendler, Gary Oldman was the severely distorted and disabled Mason Verger and the film was being directed by the recent Oscar-winning director Ridley Scott (for \\"Gladiator\\"). Although Foster turned down the role of Clarice again, it went to Julianne Moore which seemed an astute move by the film crew.  Unfortunately, \\"Hannibal\\" turns into a campy shockfest more concerned with orchestrating gory death scenes than actually creating a tense, atmospheric adaptation of Thomas Harris's critically supportive third installment of the Hannibal Lecter novel series. <br /> <br />Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is now famous for her work with Hannibal \\"the Cannibal\\" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the notorious killer who has since escaped to Venice. After a bloody drug bust resulted in a mother being shot while holding her child, Starling is tormented by her co-workers and various other people. Meanwhile, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) is hunting down Lecter in hopes for revenge. Verger is the only victim to have encountered Hannibal and survive, but he's horribly disfigured from the experience and has become obsessed with Lecter. While all of this is happening, Lecter is living the good life in Venice, becoming a very respectable yet creepy fellow. Things become complicated though when Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) finds out who he really is. Verger tells Starling that he may know where the great cannibal is and this sets things into motion. Now with co-worker Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) breathing down her neck, Clarice revisits her experiences with Hannibal and starts to contact Pazzi. Unknown to her, Verger has paid Pazzi a hefty sum of money in order to catch Lecter alive. After the failed attempt resulted in a gory manner, Lecter comes back to America to visit Clarice and break the silence.  Julianne Moore made little impression with her portrayal of Starling though that`s through little fault of her own because it`s always the most difficult job of an actor playing a role made famous by someone else , and Starling is sidelined in much of the film . As for the other actors, Hopkins is competent but by no means spell binding , Liota gives the impression that a robot played his role throughout the film, Giancarlo Giannini is good, but Gary Oldman absolutely steals the show as Mason Verger playing the role just the right side of camp complete with some great make-up . <br /> <br />As for the other aspects of \\"Hannibal\\", Ridley Scott directs with an almost operatic touch.  You really do get the feeling watching this that Scott`s ambition in life is to do a remake of \\"Amadeus\\" with Hopkins in the role of Atonio Salieri; however, the one major flaw with \\"Hannibal\\" is the script by Mamet and Zaillian, only moderately staying true to the book and deviating from the original components that made \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" so efficient and engrossing, especially with the ending which is riducously over the top .  Despite Scott's ability to make a visually stunning and intriguing film, we are still left with a lack of narrative thrust, so that while individual scenes, particularly those depicting Lecter at large in a gothically-rendered Florence of shadows and fog, have a certain fascination, they don't really join up to make a satisfying whole. Besides which, Anthony Hopkins does not seem to have re-discovered the inimitable creepiness as Lecter that he nailed in \\"Lambs\\". It seems that uncaged, Lecter lacks thecoiled menace of his earlier incarnation, and Hopkins seems to have merely turned up to collect his paycheck this time round. Possibly the biggest problem with \\"Hannibal\\", however, is the absence of Jodie Foster. Into her shoes steps Julianne Moore, a fine actress in her own right, but a calm, almost ethereal presence where Foster was pugnacious, edgy and brittle. Foster defined the role, and Moore has a thankless task made all the more difficult by a script that gives her little to do but react to the machinations of the corrupt men that surround her.  A major letdown from a big-time director and a usually solid group of cast members. <br />

1558908323|4.0|Director:  Guillermo del Toro <br />Cast:  Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam, Alexander Goodwin, Giancarlo Giannini, Charles Dutton, Josh Brolni, Alix Koromzay, F. Murray Abraham, James Costa. <br />Running Time:  105 minutes <br />Rated R for terror/violence and language. <br /> <br />\\"Mimic\\", like all great genre pictures, exists comfortably in two spheres: on the simple level, it speedily entertains as a gory fright film imbued with mordant humor; on the more difficult level, it provides symbolism and thematic undertow. Best of all, these two levels often work at the same time, such as when an old priest gets tossed off a building by one of the creatures, plummeting past a neon \\"Jesus Saves\\" sign, and crashing to a gory death on the pavement. A little while later, the creature drags the dead body into the gaping black maw of an open sewer.  The latter is what \\"Mimic\\" is really really for: the importance of breeding and offspring. The movie's surreal opening, with its rows of linen-canopied hospital beds all in a row like so many little coffins, shows us sick children, gasping for air because a cockroach-borne disease is carrying them off. The battle lines are drawn in the first few moments: Us versus Them.  Scientists Mia Sorvino and Jeremy Northam glean the cure for the dread disease by concocting a genetically-altered bug whose secretions kill off the diseased cockroaches; \\"Judas Breed\\", as it's called, will be the only true breed this couple will engender: Sorvino fails pregnancy tests at home, while their creature, supposedly unable to reproduce, grows apace underneath Manhattan's fallopian sewers. It merely seems like \\"nature's way\\" that the Judas Breed has mutated to the size of six feet, and can mimic standing upright like their human prey, It's also fitting that these creatures instinctively hone in on the vulnerability of children: they viciously rip apart two kids, and befriend another who has managed to communicate with them by clicking soup-spoons together.  <br /> <br />This is an atmospheric thriller from Guillermo del Toro, director of \\"The Devil's Backbone\\" and \\"Cronos\\", who manages to mix great direction with good old fashioned monster horror to great effect. The concept itself is clever, even if the idea of bugs evolving to look very like humans is a little fa-fetched; however, once the action moves to the subway the fact that the bugs are clearly lethal no matter what they look like, makes this less important. The film is quite short and makes the action come quicker and seem more urgent. Several people get killed by the bug that wouldn't usually get killed in this sort of horror (children for example), this is very effective as it is quite scary to see the unexpected happen.  The mood is dark throughout and Del Toro uses the sewers and subway to great effect, creating a real sense of claustrophobia, like the humans have entered the bug's world and not the other way round. The bugs are shown early on in the film - usually not a good idea (keep it hidden in the \\"Jaws\\" way), but here the special effects are good enough to make the bug really believable, yet the horror is not in seeing the bugs but in they way they hunt and kill, but the fear is in what could happen.  The cast are great, Sorvino especially is very good in the lead. Jeremy Northam and Charles S. Dutton are good in support and Abraham Murray adds a bit of cameo class (though his role is quite unnecessary). The director is the real star, adding some genuine scares and real mood to a film that could have easily been just another creature-feature that goes straight to video and straight to the back of your mind.  Overall a superior creature horror film.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I first heard of the Mars Volta while reading a review of a Miles Davis album in which the author compared the mid-seventies experimentations of Miles Davis with the music of the Mars Volta. Naturaly, I was intrigued. I listened to Intertiatic ESP, L'via L'viaguez, Drunkship of Lanterns and various other tracks. Love was in the air that day.  <br /> <br />I got this album in early september, but it took me a few weeks to get my head around it. It sounded more than a little strange at first, but eventualy the picture unfolded, and it was wonderful. Some songs, like Roulette dares (the haunt of), Televators, and Eriatarka didn't do much for me at first, but after more listens I appreciated them much more.  <br /> <br />My favourite track on the album is Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt. The bass, guitar, and keryboard solos are all highlights. It's always nice when a brilliant album ends with a brilliant song, too often last songs are lack-luster, but TMV know how to end an album with style.
B00000JGHL|2.0|Cast:  Harold Becker <br />Cast:  Al Pacino, John Cusack, Bridgett Fonda, Danny Aiello, Martin Landau, David Paymer, Anthony Franciosa, Richard Schliff, Lindsay Duncan. <br />Running Time:  111 minutes <br />Rated R for language and some violence. <br /> <br />\\"City Hall\\" is one of those hopeful yet ultimately frustrating films that never really delivers toward its potential. It's as if the characters, the plot, and the pacing of the film were kept apart throughout filming, and then only introduced in the editing room.  The film begins with a lackluster conflict, the accidental shooting of a child by a drug dealer with relatives in the NY mob families who looks as if he came directly from Central Casting, and acts just as stiff. Before we even know anything about this character, he's confronted by a possibly corrupt cop ( the entire background motivation and confusion regarding the cop's rational for meeting with the drug dealer alone, without backup and without reporting in first is left completely unresolved), gunfire is exchanged, and everyone is dead, including the innocent child, who is clearly injected into this formula for nothing more than aesthetic/emotional purposes, and is treated like \\"cinema-chum\\", shot dead for instant sympathy by the audience, only to draw in the bigger fish in the water, the primary characters. <br /> <br />On the heels of the shooting, we are introduced to our principles, Al Pacino as the mayor, John Cusack as the deputy mayor, single-handedly managing the entirety of New York. The completely contrived setup of the administration of a city the size of New York being managed, at least from all appearances we are given on screen, by these two characters is beyond laughable, but  insipid.   The central plot of the movie springs from the reaction by City Hall to this one shooting incident, as the world is (we suppose) put on temporary pause for days afterward in New York by this event. Cusack abandons his supposed position with City Hall and becomes a knee-jerk Mickey Spilane, trodding beside Bridget Fonda on some half-ass investigation of the politics surrounding the now dead cop, suspected of corruption, and the question of why the drug dealer was ever on the streets in the first place, having been questionably released on parole years before. Everyone phones in their performances, which appears as if everyone approached the movie with high hopes, then got distracted by something better to do, (possibly calling their agents for better scripts once this movie started filming) and just showed up to through with the dialogue.  Numerous gaffs, faux pauxs regarding life in New York, cornball accents by Cusack, Fonda's character operating with the depth of a spring puddle, vanilla backgrounds, boring dialogue (save Al Pacino's impassioned, yet ultimately weak tirades toward the shooting of James Bone and his personal conversations with Pappas) make for a really unsatisfying films; \\"City Hall\\" just can't deliver and feels like a TV movie of the week.
B000B8QF00|4.0|The career of Alanis Morissette has been long and winding, despite the fact that the average music fan cannot see past her 1995 breakthrough \\"Jagged Little Pill,\\" the best-selling album ever by a female artist. Now, it is finally catalogued on \\"The Collection,\\" a disc that spans the last decade of the Canadian singer/songwriter's music.<br /><br />Those of the opinion that a hit package from Morissette would essentially be a repackaging of Jagged Little Pill have a point; she has released only a handful of hit singles since that juggernaut. Nevertheless, in paving the road that subsequently ensued she released records that were true to herself and did not cash in on her initial success as an \\"angry\\" young singer/songwriter. The result has yielded her a rabid fanbase and music that has affected many listeners in a positive way, which is hardly something to look down at.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"The Collection\\" is a rather iffy collection that comes off sounding disjointed when it comes to summarizing the Morissette's last decade. Right off the bat, anyone who has even a minimal knowledge of her career will see that some notable singles are missing such as \\"All I Really Want,\\" the swashbuckling \\"So Pure\\" from 1998's \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" and \\"Precious Illusions,\\" a sharp radio-ready single that reached the Adult Top 40 in summer 2002 but ultimately went over everyone's heads. Also, two \\"personal favorites\\" she chose for the collection, 1999's unplugged performance of \\"Princes Familiar\\" and 2002's excruciatingly sad \\"Simple Together,\\" sound completely out of their element on a retrospective. Perhaps a better idea would have been a \\"Hits\\" and \\"Misses\\" pair of releases a la fellow Canadian songstress Joni Mitchell. Still, her unforgettable staples such as \\"Thank U\\" and \\"Ironic\\" are dutifully included and have not lost their power with the passage of time.<br /><br />Especially of interest are tracks making their debut on a proper Morissette record. One such is \\"Mercy,\\" a selection from Jonathan Elias' 1999 project \\"The Prayer Cycle,\\" an album of swirling, devotional vocals in multiple languages that featured recording artists such as James Taylor and Linda Ronstadt. Morissette sings in Hungarian (her mother's native tongue) on the track alongside the vocals of famed Qawwli artist Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, who passed away immediately before she was asked to join the project. The result is something as spine tingling as it as sophisticated. Included also is her zesty take on Cole Porter's \\"Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love)\\" from the \\"De-Lovely\\" soundtrack. Morissette played a bit part in the 2004 film that told the life story of the late tunesmith.<br /><br />There's also \\"Uninvited,\\" a fan favorite that Morissette wrote for the soundtrack to 1998's \\"City of Angels\\" where she sings not only from the perspective of the main character but also her own in the face of overwhelming fame in \\"Jagged Little Pill\\"'s wake. An even stronger inclusion, however, is \\"Still,\\" which Morissette wrote for 1999's \\"Dogma\\" soundtrack. In the film she played the small but crucial role of God, and thus chose to write the song from His perspective.<br /><br />\\"I see you altering history/I see you abusing the land/I see you and your selective amnesia/And I love you still.\\"<br /><br />The biggest slice of ear candy on the disc, however, comes in the form of her take on \\"Crazy,\\" Seal's classic 1991 hit. A song with a catchy groove and powerful lyrics, it is easy to see why it is one of Morissette's favorite songs.<br /><br />\\"Crazy yellow people walking through my head/One of them's got a gun, shoots the other one/And yet together they were friends at school/But we're never gonna survive/Unless we get a little crazy.\\"<br /><br />The scarce but desirable limited edition of \\"The Collection\\" contains improved artwork and a loaded DVD with an hour-long documentary, photographs, overviews of past tour itineraries and three bonus performances including an unreleased track from the mid-90's entitled \\"King of Intimidation.\\"tion.\\"
B0001GL3K4|3.0|Love Actually is a story...no wait, I should say it has different stories within itself about people from The Prime Minister, to an aging Rock Star, to a Writer, to a guy who wants to meet women in America to other people who fall in love around Christmas time. Hugh Grant (upcoming American Dreamz, About a Boy) plays The Prime Minister who falls in love with his catorer Natalie played by Martine McCutcheon (Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang). Liam Neeson (Batman Begins, Kingdom Of Heaven) lost his wife and his son is falling in love with a girl from America, so the son learns how to play drums to try to impress her. Colin Firth (Girl With a Pearl Earring) is a Writer who falls in love with Aurelia, played by Lucia Moniz (29 Golpes). Alan Rickman (Die Hard, Dogma) is married to Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee, Dead Again), go figure, and he also is getting hit on by a woman he works with and Bill Nighy (Underworld 1&2, Constant Gardener) plays Billy Mack, an aging Rock Star. It's really funny at times, especially Bill Nighy who delivers a great performance. It's filled with a lot of British actors and actresses...a lot but then there are some cameo appearances by Billy Bob Thornton (Bad Santa), Denise Richards (Wild Things), Elisha Cuthbert (House Of Wax), January Jones (Amerian Wedding), Claudia Schiffer (Black & White), Ivana Milicevic (In Her Shoes) and Shannon Elizabeth (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). It's quite long (135 minutes hmmm, they could of shortened it dont you think?). Also starring Keira Knightley (Pride & Prejudice, Domino), Chiwetel Ejiofor (upcoming Inside Man, Serenity), Martin Freeman (Shaun of The Dead), Laura Linney (Exorcism of Emily Rose, p.s.), Andrew Lincoln (Enduring Love), Sienna Guillory (Helen of Troy), Heike Makatsch (Resident Evil) and Rowan Atkinson (Johnny English, Bean). Probably not for everyone but it is certainly enjoyable. Billy Mack says \\"Hiya kids. Here is an important message from your Uncle Bill. Don't buy drugs. Become a pop star, and they give you them for free\\"

B0009MDPYM|1.0|Dreary action thriller that would like you to believe that its about something when it's really about nothing. Keanu Reeves gives another one of his great wooden performance as a supernatural detective who helps a cop (Rachel Weisz) try to solve apparent suicide of her twin sister unknowing of the dark forces that are at work. Safe to say that Keanu is ready to save the world again but when he does it, you don't believe a single thing he does because you don't believe him in the role. The movie would have been better served if they got an actor who would have played the role a bit more maturely and with a bit more feeling but Reeves just seem more like a cry baby than a man who know what he is doing and he just does not come across well in the role. The script unfortunately adds fuel to the fire with its unfocused story and lousy lines of dialog, which is literally over juvenile for a movie that has such dark themes.  The direction also adds nothing in terms of helping the movie out of its dilemma with way too many unfocused shots and too many unnecessary scenes that adds nothing to the movie at all. <br /> <br />There is some good in this movie and it comes from Rachel Weisz, who gives the movie's only stellar performance. She's so good that you feel like you're watching a better movie with her on the screen while you know deep down that the movie is not as good as her performance.  Another good performance comes from Peter Stormare who is criminally underused in a bit part as the devil himself. His performance is ten times more potent than the lousy performance of Keanu Reeves as the lead and he's only in the film for about five minutes. <br /> <br />I don't know exactly what went wrong with this film but if the producers of the movie wanted to make a better film, they just could have cut Keanu out all together and just focus on the great performance of Weisz and Stormare. Add a director who knows what he is doing and a script that makes sense and you have a greatmovie there. This movie unfortunately is not very good and you can thank Keanu and the director for that.  <br />
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I'm confused. On one hand, Guru thinks Tom Cruise can act, while complaining that Reeves cannot.  Okaaaaaaaaaaay. Gotcha.   <br /> <br />While NOT a huge fan of Reeves myself, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this film (which I now own...bought it used of course!) :-)   <br /> <br />I am a HUGE fan of Rachel Weisz, however, and while her talents were regulated to the \\"greiving sister\\", I thought the movie (plot and all, folks...) was enjoyable. <br /> <br />I could care less whether or not it was \\"true\\" to some kid's comic book.  Obviously, the written vs. visual representations will differ, but I have begun to reevaluate my estimation of K. Reeves as an actor (until he does another Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!)
B00003CX9E|1.0|After seeing it for the first time, I returned it to the sender with a note telling him to find a better film for a gift next year. Does the director realize that movies are not made for putting people to sleep.
B00005JNEI|4.0|While I understand that Michael Moore had a skewed agenda in producing this movie, I think a lot of what he has portrayed cannot be ignored. <br /> <br />The truth is that George W Bush is just as corrupt a politician as most in WA.  He can hide behind \\"God\\" all he wants but if Jesus came back, he'd be one of the first ones to be thrown out of the temple. <br /> <br />To think that we as a country are not driven by power and gain is ridiculous.  Of course Bush shelters the Saudi's just like almost every other president has done because we are not in the business to care about freedom unless there is profit to be gained.  We don't invade other countries unless we can get something back for it.  We don't invest in other countries unless it benefits us. <br /> <br />We have no problem giving weapons to monsters, to use them for our cause, even though time and time again those monsters turn those weapons back on us at a later date. <br /> <br />We barely fought a war on terroism because of Bush and his Iraq agenda.  People dont like to be lied to and that is where Bush made a mistake.  They concocted a story to get us to back them when the rest of the world wouldn't even back Bush.  I think that if American people truly knew the reasons, agendas, and politcally motivated decision making that takes place in WA everyday, we probably couldn't even handle it.  If we knew the depths of the lies, we couldn't even process it.  It's much easier to trust in our government then to comprehend it's weaknesses. <br /> <br />I would never ever enroll in the military.  I think the govenment is disrespectful of these men and woman who put their life on the line every day for us.  When things go bad over there and our children come home injured beyond repair from chemical warfare etc., our government pretends it didn't happen.  And if you are not a lifer, forget getting help assimilating back into society after you've killed and had to watch war atrocities.  You're on your own and goodluck finding a decent job when all you've been trained to do is fire artillery.  We as a country fail these miliary personnel every day. <br /> <br />So, if it takes a Michael Moore to throw things in our faces to make us want to find out the truth or pay attention to what our pitiful government is concocting, then so be it.  Power to the people.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I loved the original film. It was light and fun...great kids movie. I still love it. I found this movie just as good, but completely different. It has Tim Burtons trade mark darkness placed into it. And I feel more of Dahl's book is actually in it. This one does follow the book more closely, though this movie does add an extended ending, which does not exist in the text. But do not expect to see the same charming movie...it is not here.    Johnny Depp's take on the reclusive Willie Wonka was strange and interesting. I could see his character being a recluse. And he has the typical quirkiness of a true genius. Who, in this case puts his driven and strange intellect toward making chocolate.     Mr. Burton decided to make the tribe of Oompa-Loompas played by Deep Roy. Who does a great job considering everything that this placed on his shoulders. The lyrics from these songs come right out of the book. But I must admit I had a hard time hearing them with the music chosen. I would have liked to be able to discern the lyric better. Other then that, I thought the movie is great. And I recommend both versions, but only the original one I feel is appropriate for young children.
0679777547|3.0|I'm not a big mystery fan.  But, having read several glowing reviews about The Dumas Club, I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about.  It didn't take long for me to see why others liked this book.  Perez-Reverte does a masterful job of setting the mood and ratcheting up the tension throughout the story.  What's more, his development of the story's protagonist, Lucas Corso, is strong enough to cause the reader to become emotionally attached to Corso as he moves through this mystery.  Still, the ending is a letdown after such a good build-up.  Additionally, Perez-Reverte's incessant \\"title-dropping\\" of obscure books was a bit less clever than what it was likely intended to be.  In the end, these flaws left me believing that The Dumas Club is not as good as the hype would lead one to suppose.  Still, if approached with lower expectations, it will provide the reader with a good diversion for a few hours or days.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I've been reading the other reviews on this product and was a bit surprised to see so many bad reviews because i really like mine. I agree on the battery problem. It doesn't last long while using the sweeper, about 15 min. but mine's always worked again after it's been charged. I think people need to know that it works best on carpet that is like indoor-outdoor carpet. We are in the military and are stationed in Okinawa Japan, and usually base housing never has carpet, especially here because it's a tropical island and mold is a serious issue. But we have an apt on base that is newly built and they put carpet down, but it's that kind that is  indoor-outdoor carpet, you know, no padding underneath. They just roll it out and I guess glue it down, but my swivel sweeper works so so so so wonderfully on it because of the type of carpet it is. With carpet like this, where it's real close to the ground, regular vacuums just seem to throw the stuff back at your feet because they can't reach that close to the ground. But because the swivel sweeper works the way it does, it's perfect for our house. I would have given it 5 stars but the cannister doesn't hold much and has to be emptied often but i really don't mind that. It's been a lifesaver to me with the kind of carpet i have. I've not had a problem using it on my kitchen floor either.  Hope this helps!
B000A59PMO|5.0|I have watched plenty of television shows in the past and I can honestly say that none of them have gripped me quite like Veronica Mars has. This show has everything that you could possibly want: drama, intrigue, romance, and comedy all rolled into one brilliantly written package. Added to this is the superb acting done by the cast. They all shine in their respective roles and really and a sense of believability to the show.  <br />    I highly recommend that people find a way to watch the show, whether by buying the DVDs here on Amazon or renting them through Netflix. You are missing out if you haven't seen this show. <br />    Rob Thomas has really created a masterpiece here with Veronica Mars. Hopefully UPN will also see this and renew the show for a 3rd season!
B0002EXH5E|1.0|Ok first off, unlike, I'm guessing, a lot of people rating this album 1 star, I am willing to give it a shot.  I pride myself on being able, for the most part, to find at least one song on every album released by a band I like, that I enjoy, and this is no exception, but come on...  Honestly I don't know what to believe, when it comes to this album.  I've read quotes where Dave has blamed the producer, and I heard an interview where he blamed Marty.  Megadeth was and is always Dave's band, so I find it hard to believe he'd release this unwillingly, and think, just my own opinion, that its failure, and the backlash from fans sparked his statements, and finger pointing.  Either way we have for your listening pleasure, I use that term loosely, Megadeth's much maligned 1999 release \\"Risk\\".  When listening to this album it's important to note that this is more of a sellout album than any of the loads metallica dropped in the late 90's, and honestly, although those clunkers contained some REALLY bad songs, much worse than anything on here, I'd still take the better songs from those albums over this one.  It's also worth noting that being a sellout album, the trends for rock music at the time.  Metal was just not allowed on radio, PERIOD.  As a rock or metal band you had two choices, if you wanted to be successful, thankfully Dream Theater ignored both of these in their 1999 album \\"Scenes from a memory,\\", great album by the way.  You could either do soft alternative rock, similar to matchbox 20/third eye blind, hey anyone remember those crappy bands, or you could go industrial and use all sorts of electronic crap effects and techno dance beats, Gravity kills, NIN.  And, most bands chose one of these two directions.  Smashing pumpkins released a techno album, I've tried desperately to forget, except for a song or two, Foo fighters released a fairly soft album, \\"There's nothing left to lose.  All this to say you can't completely blame Megadeth.  All sorts of bands everywherewere selling out.  Still as a long time Megadeth fan, for me their sound is one of the key things that define them, as a band.  Heck Dave's replaced every member since this release, several times.  Seriously he's had at least three drummers, two bas players and three second guitarists, at least.  I could be wrong on the numbers, but his later albums have that Megadeth sound.  They're still not up to the level of Rust in peace, but they're getting there.  And I'm not one of those people stuck in the past, who can't accept a band developing or growing, but growing or evolving is a band taking what they already do and expanding on it, not throwing everything their fans want away for something completely different.  Ok as far as this album itself, they tend to be all over the place, going in BOTH God awful directions I mentioned earlier.  You have soft alternative songs like Breadline, and Ecstasy, and industrial garbage like crush em, seriously couldn't write out \\"them\\"?  I don't have a track listing in front of me, so forgive me if I miss a song or two, but here goes.  Insomnia; 4/10 - This song would be better if they'd come up with better lyrics, especially in the chorus.  The melody is ok, but the insomni, omni, omni, omnia, this is VERY cheesy.  It's a pretty fast paced, not compared to old Megadeth, industrial rocker, filled with all sorts of electronic noises and an annoying violin that screeches throughout most of the song.  It's ok I guess, but definately not a favorite of mine.    Prince of Darkness; 6/10 - This song starts with an annoyingly long intro, with a drum beat, and Dave rambling about being the devil.  Seriously, this album's bad enough as it is, just get through it as quickly as possible, and stop wasting our time.  Once the song does kick in, it's a mid tempo rocker, with a sort of groove to it.  It's got a decent melody, and thankfully I was able to cut the intro, when putting the song onto my computer.  There's an annoying violin section in the bridge.  Ok now don't get me wrong, when used properly a violin is NOT a bad thing, but using it in this high pitched screeching way they do here is just awful.  Enter the arena or whatever that one's called -infinity/10, simply a bad intro to Crush em; 0/10 - Ok so I should not hear an intro to a Megadeth song, that reminds me of an intro to a Gravity kills song.  They released an album called \\"Perversion\\" right around this same time too, 98-2000, can't remember, and also a much better album.  At least that band is suppose to do industrial rock.  Anyways this song has a crappy disco/techno beat, with Dave talking some garbage, and a random guitar lick here and there thrown in.  It builds to a little more of a rock sounding chorus, but it's still overly cheesy, with the shouts of \\"Crush, Crush em?\\", thrown in there.  Seriously just a horrible song.  Breadline; 7/10 = I actually enjoy this song.  Granted if it'd been done by the Foo Fighters I'd have liked it better, but whatever.  It's a soft alt rock song.  It has a groovy beat, when the drums  kick in.  Still the song's well put together, and there's nothing annoying about it.  Wow, sad that a song having nothing annoying makes it the best song so far.  Doctor is calling; 2/10 - Should get a 1, just for the intro of the kid saying \\"daddy the doctor is calling\\".  Very stupid.  This song is filled with all sorts of vocal samples, something that'd plague the next album as well.  The verses are alright, and the chorus is ok as well, but the intro, riff included, are awful, and I can't get past the annoying voices thrown about randomly.  Awful song.  I'll be there; 2/10 - The vocals are actually alright in this one.  The chorus is a bit cheesy, but if the music had been better, it'd be tolerable.  The song starts with a weird distorted guitar before quickly jumping into a dance beat, sort of, with a weird keyboard.  There's also some soft guitar notes being played during the verses.  It gets heavier in the chorus, but heavier for this album still doesn't even come close to Cryptic writings, so it's not saying much.  Wanderlust; 3/10 - I actually like the chorus.  The vocals and the music make me think of someone walking into an old saloon in a western looking for a fight, don't know why it makes me think of that, but whatever.  Unfortunately the rest of the song sucks.  The verses are a drum beat with weird noises and I think a little guitar, it's been a long time, and Dave talking softly.  Seriously half the time I couldn't even hear the verses, even when I would listen to this song.  Seven; 5/10 maybe 6 = Well this one sort of rocks a little.  It's one of the heavier songs, which is sad.  It moves faster than anything else on the album, except for Insomnia.  Still the song should have been heavier, and the chorus melody neded some work.  I don't know what it is, but it bugs the crap out of me.  Ecstasy; 3/10 - Another groove induced soft song.  It has a soft alt rock guitar strumming during the verses, with a groovy drum beat.  The chorus bugs me almost as much as Seven's.  Time both the beginning and the end; 8/10 - Ok so every Megadeth album has its classics, and this one manages to have one song I really like, granted it could be better, but whatever.  Now why they split these is beyond me, but luckily I have a program which allowed me to merge them, so whenever I listen to it, I hear it as one song.  The Beginning is essentially the verses and choruses of the song.  The first verse is acoustic guitar drive with Dave singing and I think some drums, but I can't remember right now.  I know they kick in during the second verse, which gets annoying because some keyboards kick in and overpower the acoustic guitars.  Seriously the song worked a hell of a lot better as an acoustic song, at least this part did, and made it seem less sell outy.  But that was maared by the keyboards.  Still a nice start to the song.  I like the vocals, and the acoustic guitars, when you can hear them.  I'm indifferent to the lyrics, but they're not bad, so I can live with them.  The end is a heavier part that serves and the bridge and solo.  I don't really have a whole lot to say about it, except the first part has nothing after the second chorus, so this ends the song nicely.  I recomend merging the two songs, because they should've been from the start, one song.  If you're new to Megadeth, definately DO NOT start here.  I'd recomend Rust in Peace or Countdown to Extinction.  Youthanasia, Hidden Treasures, and Killing is my business are also good.  After you have all the other Megadeth albums you could do what I did, and turn Risk into a second Hidden Treasures.  I just added Kill The King, One Thing, Strange Ways, and Crown Of Worms to the few ok songs I could tolerate.  I also joined the 2 Times to make one good song.  Overall I recomend downloading Time, Prince of darkness, Breadline, and maybe Insomnia and Seven, and avoid the rest.  You can also listen to the whole album on youtube and decide for yourself, but overall I say avoid it.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I'm wondering, cuz I saw this early in 2005 when it was in theaters, but the description of the DVD says the following: <br /> <br />Available Audio Tracks: (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround) <br /> <br />Now, I want to buy the DVD, but not if it's been dubbed. So, can anyone help me here? Is it? Is it not?
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved this movie almost as much as the series. It's visually interesting without the special effects being overdone; it's fast-paced and entertaining; and the dialogue is snappy and fun. Reminiscent of the first Star Wars, it shows a \\"realistic\\" future and \\"flawed\\" heros rather than the idealistic future and bigger-than-life heros of adventures like Star Trek.  We need to see more movies with these fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants adventures...  <br /> <br />If you can't stand adventure movies, science-fiction or fantasy, you should steer clear of this gem, as you will never give it a proper chance.  However, if you are like me, always on the look-out for a well-done science-fiction, fantasy and/or adventure movie- than buy/see this now!
B000ASDFJU|5.0|This is a beautifully packaged set and I'm so glad I waited for it. I was tempted to buy them individually, but figured that I would wait for the complete set and YEAH! it was worth it! Although, I haven't watched all the DVDs yet, the album layout and extra featured make this set a special little treasure.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Her strong voice orders me to dance! <br /> <br />Her soothing voice is alluring! Her profound lyrics arouse the wolfman in me! Her stellar dancing reminds me of Ginger Rodgers dancing with the dead Fred Astair! She moves like a rapacious taurine searching for her next mate!  <br /> <br />The best tracks are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11! The stirring lyrics of #10 made me convert to religion! The steamy Hung video with her stretched out on the floor made me sweat with anticipation! Mercy me!  <br /> <br />Madonna is so hot! Her deep cleavage is pure enticement! Her big, round breasts are delectable! Her luscious midriff is so exciting to look at! Her smooth, creamy thighs are pure pachyderms! Her hair shines like the morning sun! Her smile is toothy! <br /> <br />She looks better now than in her Penthouse portfolio days! She has aged gracefully! I love her new man arms! She sings better now than in her virgin days! You can tell she has been exercising like a hungry beaver! (A beaver needs thick long branches to survive.)  <br /> <br />Thank you very much for reading my review! Happy New Year everybody! Thanks again! Happy Kwanza! Thanks!     <br />

B00005JO1Y|1.0|I first saw King Kong back in the early 50's when i was a kid. Then i saw the 1933 version again back in the 70's at a revival on the big screen.  That was impressive. But this new version with it's special effects totally take away from the story line and is way over done.  I'll never understand what and why Hollywood has this obsession with special effects.  I much rather see a film for it's acting and who can beat the old way of special effects before computers.  You call computers creative?  Anyone can do this type of thing but in the older films it took TALENT to make a film like \\"King Kong\\" something that Hollywood doesn't believe in anymore.  Save your money and get the newly restored 1933 version.  Much much better.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|If you are into Hip-Hop or Barney music, you may not like it. If you are a normal person who has good taste for music, you will love it!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|2001's \\"Exciter\\" was a slightly-above-average album, but if you were to compare it to masterpieces such as \\"Black Celebration\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Ultra\\", it would not seem like a good album at all. Depeche Mode never quit, though. They were certainly aware that they could do much better. Recently, they went into the studio  and recorded their next masterpiece, ranking up there with \\"Some Great Reward\\", \\"Violator\\", and yes, even \\"Ultra\\". <br /> <br />Meet \\"Playing The Angel\\". From the gigantic layer of noise in the beginning of 'A Pain That I'm Used To' to the last spacey sound effect in 'The Darkest Star', you'll be pleased. This is obviously a must in your collection. Still, I don't understand why everyone is dissing this album, going so far as to call Martin Gore a 'horrible lyricist' and to call the production 'messy.' Yes, I am aware that this album is far more dark than \\"Exciter\\", but the only song that sounds anything like NIN is 'The Sinner In Me'...\\"Yeah, I know. Depeche Mode is horrible, just like Duran Duran. Let's go listen to AUDIOSLAVE.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />As for the songs themselves, they're spectacular.  <br />'A Pain That I'm Used To' is a great industrial-esque piece with some great lyrics...'I'm not sure what I'm looking for...anymore.' Actually, I lost myself in your lyrics, too. First we're talking about rebuilding ourselves, then we're discussing faith and devotion, then we stumble upon the topic of love thieves...I'm confused!  <br /> <br />'John The Revelator' is a much better song than it is given credit for! So he rhymed elevator...with revelator...and then rhymed that with operator.The lyric of one song shouldn't matter when you're reviewing THE WHOLE ALBUM. Some of these people are like children! <br /> <br />I also love 'Suffer Well', a great dance hit with a good, punch-you-in-the-face bassline with lyrics 'Just hang on...suffer well...sometimes it's hard...hard to tell.' I know that some of the background noise can be frustrating, but give the album a chance. If people didn't give OK Computer a chance, it wouldn't be seen as one of the greatest albums of all time. If people didn't give The Beatles a chance...oh help me. <br /> <br />The other great songs are 'Precious', a retro-DM song that's great to listen to after a bad breakup. Ouch. Martin Gore sings 'Macrovision', another good song but perhaps too boring. 'I Want It All' is a great, dark song with the patented 'DM Guitarline'. Top-notch. 'Lillian' and 'Nothings Impossible', along with 'Damaged People' are choice. <br /> <br />All in all, I would really like it if someone were to play 'Precious' around New York/Long Island. I've seen the music video on local music channels, and Depeche Mode along with Bon Jovi are becoming the latest 'word-of-mouth' bands in my school. I'd rather have them be great bands than 311 or The Used. I'd reccomend this album to goths, people who like music in general or maybe people who like noise and depressing lyrics! Excuse me for now, I have to go lend out a copy of 'Ultra'.
B000001ES9|4.0|If you know Rush only from what's on their 80's/90's albums or their classic 70's Sci-fi Rock albums brace yourself. Their first album is a time capsule from the band's early days when they were slogging it out on the Toronto club scene and before Neal Peart joined and changed the sound of this band forever.<br /><br />I remember buying this album in high school on a $4.00 budget cassette when I was fascinated with \\"2112\\" \\"Kings\\" and \\"Hemispheres\\" and doing a mental \\"WTF?!\\" when I first heard the raw demo-like production and those \\"Baby I'm in the Mood..\\" lyrics.<br /><br />Still its a fascinating look at the band's early influences (Zep, Who, Cream, Hendrix, Sabbath, Deep Purple) and a good look at their early club repertoire. You can really smell the cigarette smoke and spilled beer on this album. Despite silly lyrics and some misguided arrangements (Geddy tries to sing the Blues!) it's still a lot of fun.<br /><br />Unlike Rush's later albums, this LP was originally self-released on the band's own indie label and self-distributed in Canada before they signed with Mercury in the USA. It was recorded very cheaply and quickly between gigs and day jobs. The cheapness shows right down to that fugugly comic book cover design. But the cheap production works in it's favor giving it a raw punch that Rush never duplicated again with more time and money in the studio. It's still the band's hardest rocking album, and you can bet Metallica was listening carefully to this LP and trying to copy it's super-dry production style on their 80's albums.<br /><br />The remastered CD is a big improvement over the old 80's vintage Mercury/Phonogram CD (which was hissy and muddy sounding) and a worthy upgrade. And I agree with another reviewer it would have been great to have the groups first single on it as bonus tracks, since its super rare and a lot of fans have never heard it.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I had never heard of Damien Rice until I went to scotland for the semester and everyone who listened to him had nothing but amazing things to say about him and I completely understand now. He sings with emotion that isn't seen very often and it adds something to everyone of his songs. Somehow through his lyrics and playing you feel exactly what he is feeling when he plays these songs. <br /> <br />I have to say my favorite song is cannonball, and that is one of the more popular songs on the album but I think its one of the best. Volcano is another amazing song that has a haunting rhythem and is just another good work. I Remember is just an emotionally charged song with Lisa Hannigan singing the first half and Damein finishing the rest. One of the best cds i've heard in a while and I am shamelessly trying to get all of my friends into it because it is just that good.
B000059H98|5.0|I have never seen, nor did I ever expect to see, and I <br />never plan on seeing another flick like the one I just <br />finished watching.  It was so bizarre I LOVED IT!  <br />First, some history.   <br /> <br />I discovered this film on the Internet Movie Data Base <br />(IMDB.com) while searching for films that starred <br />Naomi Watts...star of the recent Holiday classic \\"King <br />Kong\\".  I knew she was a great actress after watching <br />her star with Sean Penn in \\"21 Grams\\", but I never <br />knew she was the co-star of a film entitled \\"Tank <br />Girl\\".   <br /> <br />All you have to do is take a look at the cover of the DVD box and it makes a statement in itself.  .   <br /> <br />It is one of the strangest, most enjoyable, offbeat <br />films I have ever seen.  Set in the year 2033, the <br />true star is Lori Petty...a solid, rigid, comedic <br />performance that ranks right up there with many dingy <br />blondes...however Lori is actually the smartest dumb <br />blonde I've ever seen on film.   <br /> <br />If you just wanna have fun, see \\"Tank Girl\\".  It'll <br />completely blow you away.  There is no way I can prep <br />you for this film.  The box states it is a definite <br />4-star production and (I quote), \\"This movie kicks <br />major butt!\\"  That it does!  Along with special <br />effects that go beyond Hollywood.  This film (coming <br />from a psychedelic Sixties nut like me) is a total <br />trip.   <br /> <br />There are not too many films out there that I can give <br />a rating of 10 to without it being a box office smash, <br />but this unknown nugget is a must for anyone wanting <br />to just have fun and be blown away (literally).  Naomi <br />plays a naive worker that befriends Lori and they go <br />on a rampage of the new millennium.  No more from me.  <br />I never give away a plot.  Just rent it and enjoy.  <br />Turn up the sound, kick back, take the phone off the <br />hook, and ENJOY!

055380457X|3.0|A good book, but nothing really special. Provided excellent information about the Google culture, probably its key competitive advantage, and some good stories. However, Vise's writing style is not fantastic. The story is all over the place, with no apparent order. Interesting to learn about Google, but not written in the best way, so would have to say its an average read.
B000002UXZ|4.0|This album was recorded live at the Fillmore East on New Year's Eve, 1969.  Jimi Hendrix had disbanded the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and formed a new band with Buddy Miles and Billy Cox.  The sound of Band of Gypsys is a lot less accesible to the general public then the Jimi Hendrix Experience.  I personally don't enjoy this album as much as any of the Jimi Hendrix Experience albums, although it's still quite good.  It has a rambling, shambling bluesy feel to it.  Buddy Miles wrote and sang two of the songs here, including his most famous composition, \\"Them Changes\\" (which is mistitled \\"Changes\\" here, despite the fact that Jimi introduces it as \\"Them Changes\\").  This is Jimi's least popular album, although it's some people's favorite.  If you like Hendrix, give it a listen.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|As I rarely write reviews, I felt compelled to add my two cents for this movie; which I saw after viewing the dvd series.  I'm not into Buffy/Angel/other Joss Wheddon shows, so I was a bit of a skeptic while watching the series.  The humor was biting, the action plausible, the characters developed and the plot was ORIGINAL.  God it was great seeing a sci-fi flim that didn't rely on crappy dialogue (Star Wars II), a boring storyline (Star Wars I), and overly dramatic theme music (Star Wars III).   <br /> <br />Without taking anything away from Wheddon's stand-alone movie, you will appreciate it more after seeing the series and that is most definitely not a chore. <br /> <br />I really can't pick a favorite character because they interact so well together- each one has humorous/kick-ass moments.  Obviously, I'm eagerly awaiting word of the sequel/continuation of the series and anyone who enjoys this movie will be too.
0679736646|5.0|This book is an extremely compelling and entertaining novel.  Written in a fast-paced style, it is replete with interesting characters, an enticing mystery, foreshadowing elements, and well-placed humour. I was so enthralled with the novel that I could not put it down and finished it in one night. <br /> <br />If you are well-read in sci-fi and watch a lot of sci-fi movies, you will be familiar with the universe and themes here. The novel takes places in a future where pre-cogs and others with telepathic abilities are commonplace, exactly as was portrayed in Minority Report (the PKD novel made into the movie). There is also an overarching theme of living in a virtual world that just isn't right and having to find one's way out (c.f. The Matrix, The Thirteenth Floor, and many Star Trek episodes such as Spectre of the Gun and The Royale).  <br /> <br />This book is simply outstanding. From the opening chapter where the morbid idea of preserving a dying person in \\"cold-pac\\" is presented, I was intrigued by the mix of dystopian future and mystery throughout.  <br /> <br />The only negative about this book is that whoever wrote the synopsis on the back cover of this Vintage edition was an idiot, giving away way too much information. The information there references a key point that doesn't occur until half way through the novel, and even then that info gives away the whole nature of the remaining story.
B000007177|4.0|Nightcap is exactly what the title implies. This is a collection of unreleased masters or out takes of songs by Jethro Tull. <br />Several songs appeared on either War Child or A Passion Play. <br />Tull recorded these in France and abandoned the project to return to England. <br />There are two sides to this compilation, My Round which includes the Chateau D'isaster Tapes. <br />The first few songs are direct from A Passion Play. <br />Solitaire sounds practically identical to the version on War Child. <br />The last few selections spark my interest. These songs are among the best songs Tull recorded at this time. <br />They had been in a vault and never saw the light of day until this was finally recorded. <br />Anderson released this collection because of fans who kept asking for it to be released. <br />Your Round or side two is not as good but worth a listen for Tull fans. <br />No Jethro Tull fans collection is complete without this CD.
B000A88F22|4.0|It's not a must have cause it's not a musical dvd with performances and stuff, but the Bonus part is just great! The video quality of \\"Do Somethin\\" and \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\" is GREAT. Full screen you can enjoy Britney dancin her 'selfmade' video of \\"Do Somethin'\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\".  <br /> <br />It is very funny to watch her have the time of her life, tough she's been always busy workin' with music and stuff. I'm happy she finally finds some time to spend on Kevin, altough I don't like the fact he's always partyin' and lettin' Britney with Sean Preston... But the DVD is fun yes :). It'd like to see the following dvd [Chaotic, Part 2] or somethin :P
B000002UCN|4.0|It's long past time George Harrison had an anthology of his work.  Sadly, this collection omits some of his finest Beatle classics, such as \\"I Need You,\\" and \\"You Like Me Too Much.\\"  George himself said he never cared for either 1965 composition, which is too bad as they are really excellent songs.  \\"I Want to Tell You\\" is an outstanding song that was sadly omitted from this collection as well.<br /><br />It would be nice if this collection included \\"Deep Blue,\\" and other \\"obscure\\" songs.  George was reported to have been working on another collection that would have been such an anthology that included some of his more obscure and no less nonpareil songs.  Fans are hoping such a collection will be released.<br /><br />The majority of songs on this one are Beatle songs.  Most fans already have these songs on other albums.  My ideal Harrison recording would be B sides; obscure songs and album tracks as well as some bootleg recordings.  I would also include \\"Awaiting on You All\\" and \\"If Not For You.\\"<br /><br />Yeah, I like what another reviewer suggested - \\"The George Harrison Anthology\\" would be a good name for such a collection.  Although George is no longer living in the material world, his influence continues to move and touch countless people.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|\\"Greetings from Amazon.com. <br /> <br />Just a note to confirm that we've received your request to be <br />notified when \\"Pink Floyd - Pulse\\" is available for ordering.\\" <br /> <br />That's how the reply starts off when I asked amazon to be notified of the release of this DVD. BTW it's dated 1/1/2004! <br />Two years we've been waiting!  Enough already you'd think the greatest Pink Floyd video ever would best be released, say, after the historic reunion at Live 8 or, maybe, in time for the  Christmas Shopping.  Ya think?  If ya don't eat your meat, ya can't have any pudding, I say we've eaten our meat for 2 yrs. can amazon put any pressure on these morons.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great TV series and a great movie.  While the movie may not be as good for people unfamiliar with the TV series.  It is still the best scifi movie of 2005.  Sure Star Wars looked great, but that was about it.  At the time of my review(20:56 11/31/05) Serenity was the #2 selling DVD on Amazon, with Firefly DVD being #3.  So there is definitely an audience for quality scifi with humor.  The question is:  Where was the movie theater audience?  The movie was well written, acted and produced.  All for a measly Hollywood budget of $50M.  Joss Whedon shows that he is a more than capable movie writer and director.  The sound and picture look great.  The extras, while not abundant more than make up for it with quality.  The deleted scenes are fantastic.  And the gag reel is hi-larious.  It shows just how much fun the cast had making this movie.  Truly a labor in love.  A must have for any true scifi fan. <br />The one minor gripe I have is of the chinzy DVD case.  It feels flimsy and for any viewers that buy movies to watch many times over will probably eventually break the clasps that keep the case closed.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|Another remake of a classic, right?  Well, although I did not see the original, I did enjoy watching the remake.  Adam Sandler turns in a good performance as star quarterback Paul Crewe who has fallen from greatness to disgrace after throwing a game.  He eventually ends up in jail after a high-speed police chase.  One hilarious scene after another during the chase.  It all begins with Crewe taking his wife's car on a joy-ride without her consent.  She calls the police and reports the car as stolen.  Once pulled over, Sandler delivers one funny line after another.  One officer smells alcohol, so he asks Crewe if he's been drinking.  Obviously drunk, Crewe hands over one can of beer to the officer.  He says \\"you can have that one, I have 5 more\\".  He then rams into the officers' vehicle parked behind them, thus leading the officers on the high-speed chase.  He ends up in jail, where he is forced into forming a legitimate football team to play against the guards.  He eventually meets up with CARETAKER, played by Chris Rock and they start the long journey of finding jailmates willing to play against the guards.  Many funny moments occur throughout the search with all sorts of characters joining the team.  Last but not least, Coach Nate Scarborough (played by the original Burt Reynolds) joins the team as coach/player.  Finally, the team is complete and ready to play the guards in an incredible game of big hits and hard tackles.  The ending is fairly predictable, but it delivers big-time.  The movie proves entertaining thoughout.  Laugh after laugh.  You won't be disappointed.

B00006F7IM|5.0|Tom Berenger, Corbin Bernsen, Charlie Sheen, and Wesley Snipes star in this fun film about the woeful Cleveland Indians baseball team and how a group of misfits and castoffs came together to make the Indians pennant winners again. <br /> <br />Berenger stars as Jake Taylor, a former all-star catcher who has been toiling in the Mexican league.  He gets a call from the Indians GM to come to spring training to be the team captain and help mentor the younger players.  These players include Willie Mays Hayes (Wesley Snipes), a speedy outfielder who can only hit pop flys, Rick Vaughn (Charlie Sheen), a flame-throwing pitcher fresh out of the California penal league who possesses a blazing fastball but has no control, and Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert), a hard-hitting Cuban who defected for religious freedom.  He can crush fastballs, but nothing else.  He also has a shrine in his locker with an idol named Jobu. Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen) is a high-priced third baseman who cares more about his investment portfolio than he does about baseball. <br /> <br />Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitten) has inherited the Indians after the death of her owner-husband.  A former showgirl, she is determined to move the team to Miami, where she will cash in on several perks from the city.  But to do this, the team's attendance must fall below a certain level.  Determined to get what she wants, she begins taking things away from the team, such as whirlpools, and even their private plane.  Soon the team is travelling to games by bus.  However, the team has Lou Brown (James Gammon) as their manager.  He is determined to make the Indians winners, regardless of what Rachel does. <br /> <br />The season starts off slowly for the team, and they are in their traditional last place position.  But the GM lets Lou in on Rachel's scheme, and things begin to change.  The players realize that the only option they have other than becoming free agents or being released is to win it all.  And that's what theyset out to do. <br /> <br />I'm a big baseball movie fan, and this movie is one of my all-time favorites.  The story is excellent (being a Cubs fan, I'm glad the producers didn't pick them as their team to use), and the acting is tremendous. The choice of Bob Uecker as Indians announcer Harry Doyle was a stroke of genius.  His announcing and one-liners really add a great dimension to the film.  Rene Russo does a good job as Jake's on again, off again girlfriend Lynn Wells.  Its fun to watch their ups and downs throughout the movie.  There's even a take-off on the then-popular \\"do you know us?\\" American Express Card commercials. <br /> <br />I give this teriffic movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see how a bunch of no-names and has-beens bond together for one magical season to become winners.

B0000AQS6R|5.0|Mary being the lingerie saleswoman dressed in red... In the Lampoon tradition of Christie Brinkley, the divine Nicolette Scorsese provided Chevy's Fantasy Babe interest in this excellent movie. The scene in which Randy Quaid's beer swilling Cousin Eddie transitions into Nicolette, standing on a diving board and teasing Clark, as she peels off a hot red swimsuit is just one of a thousand laughs in this utter classic. <br /> <br />With a cast like this you can't really go wrong, and Brian Doyle Murray (Bill Murray's older brother) plays his Scrooge role flawlessly. <br /> <br />Hard to pick out my favorite crazy scene, although the sequence in which Clark goes on an unwitting death ride in a super slippy saucer sled (hey, how about that alliteration?) is certainly a major thigh slapper. <br /> <br />The Special Features are rather limited, and for some reason Chevy is absent from the track Commentary, which is entertainingly handled by Bev and Randy etc. <br /> <br />Definitely a classic.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|After reading the reviews of this film on this site, I purchased this dvd.  I was prepared for it not to be as good as the reviews indicated; however, I am happy to report that all the hype is true.  This movie is FANTASTIC!  I dare say I liked it better than Wives & Daughters, which I also loved.  The script is enthralling, the cast, who were all virtually unknowns to me, are mesmerizing, the production is astounding, and the music is breathtaking.  Seriously.  I cannot think of any better adjective to describe this film other than engrossing.  If you loved Pride & Prejudice, then you'll love this film.  Even the cotton-mill, fighting for a living wage backdrop for this romance is interesting.  Give this film a try.  I'm so very glad that I did.

B0004Z33EQ|3.0|Come to think of it after seeing this sequel to the first movie FIRST BLOOD (based on the novel by David Morrell (wherein the character played by Sylvester Stallone- Johnny Rambo, a soldier who fought in vietnam is killed by the ending))- I find that it's not quite bad at all inspite of what the detractors would say.    Scripted by TITANIC movie mogul director/writer James Cameron - Stallone did more than to work out and really learn a lot of actual skills for his portrayal in this movie, but also came in volutarily for some personal touch of his for the script, and thus this flick which went co-scripted by Stallone himself, makes it a real well thought-out sequel to the previous movie.       This time picked from a prison camp by his superior played superiorly well by Richard Crenna, to take pictures of P.O.W.'s on a vietnamese war camp for evidence, Johnny Rambo is promised that upon the success of his mission -a presidential pardon shall be granted for his release, but Rambo did more than just that. However it turned out, he was framed to an abandon so as to set him up for failure on the mission by one of the superiors who are more concerned on covering his own butt than rescuing the Prisoners of War who are caught in Vietnam.    A lot of emotional juice are drawn regarding the matter concerned with the movie's plotline thematically, the concept purveyed in the movie regarding some validity in coming to love your country in spite of valid reasons there may be to hate it - is something thought provoking. And I'm yet to see how one could apply it personally into one's own system.     Anyhow, overall a good composure and budget is met in the movie with just the right amount and measure. I think, although not to top its predecessor- this sequel is decently good, it's quite alright.     AS FOR the sequel to this sequel RAMBO 3 -- I haven't seen it until recently, since the time when it first came out back in 1989, due to the many bad reviews it had received panned bythe \\"critics' - when come to think of it, it ain't so bad either. On the third installment to the Rambo series, Stallone in the role of this one-man army hero, embarked on a personal mission to rescue Richard Crenna's character who's kidnapped as the hostage by russian terrorists who're operating a war against Afghanistan, shot under the great locales of Israel (rather)... the reason winds apparent why the movie is so panned its that the movie came out during in the time when Nancy Reagan (wife of the former US pres Ronald Reagan) is already making up some truce with the russians during the Gorbachev days and its reform - so needless to say (and yet I'd say it such), that the reason for its bad publicity is nothing short of being political. Actually based on the events of the Russian bombing in Afghanistan back in xmas of 1979 (d-day of my very own late grandmother as well), and its peculiar who would have known that shortly by the turn of the century, there are some connecton to this that such an event would cumulate to a yet another terrorist attack that would shatter the world by the 9/11 incident.    Welp, as for them so-called professional \\"critics\\" -- they're only getting paid for doing their reviews, so chances are if they'd promote something as 'that good' , that movie might not be that good at all, the reason why their \\"professional\\" opinions are hired is to give a boost of publicity for any soggy film, all for the interest of sales. Thus those critics rather should not be given credit but are best left ignored.
B000055ZB8|5.0|Nosferatu is, and will be, the best horror movie of all time. If it wasn't for this, there would be no \\"Excorist\\" or \\"Frankstein.\\" The whole concept of vampires is amazing. This movie is so well made with good acting. I believe that the fact it is silent makes it even more terrfiring. <br /> <br />I read that some don't like it alot because of the music score. I don't think that should have a real bearing on the the film. It is a silent film, your lucky you even have some music! <br /> <br />All in all, this is one of my favorite film of all them. The character of Nasferatu still gives me chills when I see him.
B000C1ZXEU|4.0|The author's command of the youth's narrative voice was superb. I was captivated by the beauty of the land's description, and the language of the people. This story unmasked the secrets in religious customs and the households of ordinary people. The way Adichie weaves the abusive angle of the father into the tale was genius.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|With his sprawling, thoroughly amazing Brazilian gangland history CITY OF GOD, director Fernando Meirelles showed viewers in the U.S. that he knew how to make a damn good movie. With this complicated thriller, Meirelles \\"went Hollywood,\\" meaning bigger stars and bigger budget, but he didn't abandon his knack for clear storytelling, beautiful visuals and his ability to create a setting that's exotic yet filled with danger. The film, based upon a John Le Carre novel, centers on a stuffy, boring British official working in Kenya named Justin Quayle, played by Ralph Fiennes. At the film's beginning, Quayle's pregnant, activist wife Tessa is killed by a Kenyan roadside, and it's suggested that a friend killed her in a crime of passion. Quayle, suspecting he didn't actually know Tessa at all, goes back over his memories of their lightning-quick courtship and marriage and through all of her things in an attempt to discover who she was and what really happened to her. Rachel Weisz gives her best performance to date as Tessa. Though the murder is key to the plot, the real mystery that Quayle tries to solve is Tessa herself, and Weisz is able to play her in flashbacks as a sometimes tender, sometimes volatile, thoroughly passionate woman whose motives are always suspect. THE CONSTANT GARDENER succeeds at what other films this year, like THE INTERPRETER, tried and failed. The film manages to be suspenseful, romantic and political all at once.

B00099BPP6|4.0|The casting of german baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau as <br />Rigoletto in this otherwise all italian production is a bit <br />odd and though he sings beautifully and eloquently ultimately <br />the voice is wrong for the role lacking weight, color and bite. <br />The young Renata Scotto sings very well and is an affecting <br />Gilda but even at this early stage the voice has an unpleasant  <br />edge. Carlo Bergonzi is - as always - all elegance and refine- <br />ment but his Duke comes accross more gentleman than rake. In <br />sum a lot of talent assembled here but in the end somewhat un- <br />convincing dramatically.
B00006HAZG|5.0|This was a superb product with several well known actors, such as Daniel Radcliffe (\\"Harry Potter\\"), Maggie Smith (\\"Harry Potter\\" and \\"Hook\\"), and Bob Hoskins (\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\").  The story flows well and can easily be compared to a Hallmark production.  The movie is about 3 hours long.   <br /> <br />The story itself is heart wrenching and similar to \\"Nickolas Nickleby.\\"  If you are looking for romance watch Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  There is romance in this story, but it more of a story about David Copperfield's birth to maturity and the lessons he learned about life along the way.  Typical of most Charles Dickens' novels, the  story is full of minor characters and subplots, all of which just makes the story even more interesting. <br /> <br />Daniel Radcliffe plays the young David Copperfield, while Ciaran McMenamin was the adult David Copperfield.  I noticed that some reviewers primarily liked the first half of movie with Daniel Radcliffe.  I personally liked Ciaran McMenamin's performance.  Also note that the romance is in the 2nd half of the movie.  <br /> <br />I think that the problem is this: The audience has a difficult time identifying with another person playing the main character after spending 90 minutes watching someone else in that role.  I had a similar problem with \\"Great Expectations\\" where the main character growns up during the story and several people play the main character.
B0000214F0|3.0|I knew that Bob Guccione's Caligula, was rumored to be salacious, but after watching over two and a half hours of mostly, cruel and explicit debauchery I am both stunned and intrigued.<br /><br />Was the movie erotic? Sorry, I don't find unbridled depravity erotic or even pornographic as a whole. Yet, one couldn`t help but be stimulated by some of the graphic sex scenes, when isolated from the overriding baseness of the story. Bacchanalia scenes that included fornication, fellatio and cunnilingus. To be truthful the showing of actual sex were in two main scenes, not throughout the movie. In any case, though there was penetration in only a couple scenes the intimation and display of sexuality was overtly depicted throughout.
B000003TAW|5.0|Where Nirvana was the prologue, Weezer was the start of my intrest in music. <br /> <br />I grew up in a town called Groningen in the north of Holland. When I was 15 I spend most of my days listening to either the local radio stations or the alternative music shows late at night. I heard the first Weezer songs there. When the magazine of the legendary Vera club put the album on the top of their charts it really started coming. I had the song on a tape and listened to it all day. Besides 'Orange' by the Blues Explosion and 'crooked rain' there is no album I have to listened to more than Weezers debut album.  <br /> <br />There is not a bad track on the album. Starting off with 'My Name Is Jonas' Banging on the drums and the powerchords, singing along with \\"The Workers Are Going Home\\" with the great acoustic intro and outro. <br /> <br />\\"No One Else\\" is the first nerd song, about the singer only wanting the girl for himself, afraid to lose him. For someone who is 15 the uncertainty, dreams and weird interest and social awkwardness are so well expressed in all the songs. <br /> <br />The feeling of solitude after a break-up can be felt the best in the downbeat song 'The World has Turned and left me here', perhaps the best and most mature song on the album.  <br /> <br />That 'Weezer' maybe the teenage album of the 90's is also thanks to track 4, the now classic 'Buddy Holly'. Who doesn't want to be a star, a star like Buddy Holly. Besides the lyric it's also the song you can sing along with the easiest. And the little 9 tone break is a stroke of genious, as is the little difference in chors that follows it and leads in the end of the song. <br /> <br />An easy picking guitar and some voices lead in 'Undone', also a great song. <br /> <br />Teenage fun starts with 'Surfwax America', It has a thumping verse but the melody really starts in the chorus. The melody changes somewhat when the singer starts feeling the undertow and he is afraid he will never grow old. A greatmiddle part with just voices and some keyboards repeats the never grow old part. But it ends well after all. <br /> <br />I never liked 'Say it ain't so' so I won't talk about that song <br /> <br />The funniest song must be 'In The Garage' the nerdiest song of all. Dungeon Master, Kiss etc. However, the theme of teenage awkwardness pops up again. 'In the garage, i feel safe, no one cares about my ways, in the garage where i belong no one hears me sing this song' <br /> <br />'Holiday' can be a song about spring break, however it is not about a booked holiday in a hotel. To me it always meant to freedom of just going away when you felt like it. <br /> <br />The album ends with the long and musically most interesting 'Only In Dreams', about the boy not getting the girl. <br /> <br />Maybe now 12,5 years after it was released do I really realize how great this album still is. Weezer still make good albums but none of them has reached the overall standard of their debut which I really think it was on the best debut albums of the 1990s. Their follow-up 'Pinkerton' was certainly not bad but sounded a little scrappier. <br /> <br />Every guitar on each song might make this album seem monotone but it's how it was meant. Also the order of the song is perfect, no wonder that when they first toured Europe they played this album from track 1 to 10 in that order. <br /> <br />A classic, a real real classic.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|Wilhelm & Jakob Grimm are famous for writing \\"fairy tales\\", which were grotesque and extremely \\"grim\\". How they became so popular to kids is only that kids' minds have a more resilient approach to horror. Here we have a big bad wolf and Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel & Gretel and a sort of Rapunzel character, but in the hands of Terry Gilliam, it's all given a new approach. Will & Jake are con men trying to scratch out a living, in a German countryside that's infested with the French army. (Imagine that!)  Without giving anything away, they save a village and children, purge a wicked queen, and make everyone happy. Everything in between is most amusing. Matt Damon & Heath Ledger are the attractive brothers, and Ledger shows a special flair for physical comedy. There's a happy ending, and it suggests that the brothers got the ideas for their stories from experience. Peter Stormare is especially delightful in his parody of the frightened Italian soldier. Special Effects were used (CGI) sparingly, but to good advantage. I enjoyed it a lot.
0553801503|3.0|I wanted to give this book a raving, positive review in light of the previous excellent books in the series, but in all honesty, I just can't do it. <br /> <br />I fear that Martin has fallen in line with the Jordan debacle, The Wheel of Time, although I'm reluctant to make that comparison (not too reluctant, because I just did it). The first books of this series were unlike any I had ever read, and still rate number one in my list of favorites, but this volume has me rethinking. <br /> <br />Publishing concerns aside, someone dropped the ball on this one. It is good, don't misunderstand me, but I don't think it's on par with the rest of this excellent series. <br /> <br />I recommend you read it and see what you think, but it may not be something you want to rush out and buy in hardback. Jordan has convinced me that going to your local library first might be an excellent idea.
B000002P5W|5.0|I am going to go out on a limb and say that this Jimi Hendrix's finest album ever. Are You Experienced and Electric Ladyland are also both excellent. However, in terms of sheer beauty and listen-ability, this is Jimi's best. <br />Most of the songs on here clock in at around three and a half minutes(with the exception of axis and 6 was 9, I believe). For me, this is a relief. I like my songs a little shorter and concise.  <br />Each song is a tight little jam, and the longer ones simply compliment the compactness of the rest of the album. And there is plenty of variety. One of the above reviewers mentioned how funky and jazzy some of the tunes were, as opposed to some of the more psychedelic, previous albums, probably due to his blatant lack of fuzz and feedback on much of this album. You can actually hear Jimi play with clean tone- amazing.  <br />Axis Bold as Love is Jimi at his most subtle. You are not going to be overwhelmed by his guitar work, initially. You will be after a few close listens.  <br /> <br />

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I have already reserved the English version of this movie at EB Games for 30 dollars, as it is currently on pre-release there. They claim that the DVD should be out in the US, anywhere from January 3rd, to January 10th, 2006 (SIX, NOT TEN). But, are unsure of this. But at their best estimate, it should be out rather on Jan. 3rd or 10th, OR sometime in March of 2006 at the latest. It WILL be one or the other though, and that was a promised statement.    So just keep your fingers crossed and pray to God that the 3rd and or 10th of Jan. estimates are legit. That'll mean that we all only have to wait not even 2 weeks for the long awaited English release of Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children. ^.^
B0007Y08IS|4.0|I loved this movie, the reason is that it didn't get five stars is because of the sex scene they put in this movie.

B000002U9L|3.0|I have a tendency lately to purchase soundtracks to some of my favorite movies and I purchased this one specifically for the beauty of Bowie's \\"As the World Falls Down\\".  I was mesmerized by the music in the film's ball scene and I find the music stands alone just as beautifully. <br /> <br />This soundtrack is a return to 80's electronica (Trevor Jones) with Bowie vocals thrown in for really good measure.  If you're a Bowie fan you'll be happy; his original lyrics/music are classic, even though they weren't chart toppers.   <br /> <br />Some of Jones' tracks are a little odd (as are some of the scenes in the film...I still don't like the freaky creatures who play basketball with their heads and the music is just as unpleasant to me), but all of Bowie's tracks are a pleasure to hear. <br /> <br />Like I said, I purchased this primarily for the one track, but was happy with all of Bowie's productions.
B00065VTU4|5.0|There really isn't much more one needs to say about the guitar work of Eric Clapton, every album is going to have some stellar axe work regardless. So every now and then Mr. Clapton has to break out of his shell and come out with a great song album, and this is it. 461 is the pinnacle of Clapton's solo career and will probably never be equalled. Most of this album is subdued and melancholic, with a rocker thrown in for good measure. However, songs like the brilliant \\"Please be with me\\" dominate this mellow and resonant album. There are no real hits on this ablum with the exception of motherless children. So in a way, it may the least familiar sounding of Clapton's work.  <br />Mr. Clapton has always wanted to be a singer/songwriter of sorts, even with his considerable guitar work. In this particular case, he pulls the singer-part off quite well.
0385504209|3.0|Is a good read, but somewhat a bit too hyped. I'm mainly into perusal and critical analysis of political works or works of writers of the likes of Hemingway, Dickens, Dostoevsky and Seth (lately). A number of my buddies at college, outside college and others have had highly recommended me this book over time and again. So, I decided giving it a shot! Though I've had the chance of reading a couple of detective novels/thrillers by Michael Connelly and Val McDermid, but I must say, though the overall macrocosm in this book is finely painted, a lot remains to be asked about the underlying microcosmic current which sweeps across in resemblance to a tempest.<br /><br />I personally have no faith in God! But not because of the reason(s) the author chooses to express here. He talks about the secret society, pagan worship and other related things which are very difficult to prove indeed. Though all religions and all gods are basically man-made things, there's only one line in the whole book which is an eternal truth. After losing the Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon had truly mentioned, \\"History is a set of lies agreed upon by victors!\\" If this holds true, then maybe the way Catholic Church have had oppressed the pagan worshippers and the whole cult as a whole does make sense, but to prove that Jesus indeed was a married/familial man and Lady Magdalene was pregnant with indeed his child is, at this very point, at this very juncture in 21st century, quite difficult. Though a very good work of fiction, but would fail to impress fatalists, existentialists and cynics. As for myself, I'm happier with Feuerbach who mentioned, \\"Religion is the dream of the human mind\\" or Marx mentioning, \\"The concept of God of man is the divinized concept of man himself\\".<br /><br />Subhasish Ghosh<br /><br />St Cross College<br />University of Oxford

B000002UAX|5.0|I have to laugh when I read that review by Kyle Trane about how horrible the Beatles are when talking about the white album.He compares them to Limp Bisquit and some group or whoever called Hawthorne heights.The Beatles have retained their popularity all these years because how good they and thier music is.If they were a crappy band with no talent you could bet they would have died off a long time ago and not remember some thirty six years later.Because todays music is so shallow and unoriginal,alot of youth are turning to groups like the Beatles.Its highly unlikely that Limp Dougnut,Im sorry,I meant Limp Busquit,will ever be in the Guiness world book of records or even remembered thirty years from now.As for the White album,it is one of the best albums the Beatles released with only one bad song,or should I say noise on it.The disposable Revolution #9,which we can thank Yoko Ono for.Nineteen million copies sold since 1968 says something about how wonderful this album is. <br /> <br />
B000BGH22W|4.0|I'm a diehard Potter fan and have been a longtime fan of John Williams' soundtracks...but I'm a purist and decided to buy this cd unheard to keep my Potter collection going, even though I was initially disappointed that Williams didn't compose for GoF. <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised. The soundtrack grows up with Harry in this installment of Potter music and I was thrilled with the beauty of \\"Potter Waltz\\" and \\"Underwater Secrets\\"...even \\"Voldemort\\" is beautiful in its own dark way.  It's a little jarring to hear \\"rock and roll\\" vocals on this soundtrack and these songs are my least favorite (The soundtrack would really have been better without them, but oh well).  \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" only makes two cameo appearances and that's the extent of Patrick Doyle's homage to John Williams. <br /> <br />What can I say?  If you expect John Williams' style, you may be disappointed...I suspect those who are disappointed totally in this new composer are also those who couldn't, or had a hard time to, accept the difference between Alfonse Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban from Chris Columbus' first two films, If you spend your time comparing things (director to director, film to book, etc.) you WILL be disappointed in a lot of things. But if you let the music speak for itself, you will probably be pleased with the beauty of Doyle's compositions.
B00003CXD0|4.0|Tootsie is a complicated film to say the least. An actor has perhaps too much pride in his art for his own good and subsequently alienates any director he ever could've hoped to work for. He needs to finance his friend's play, but he can't find work. The obvious solution: disguise himself as an actress and get a part on a daytime drama. <br /> <br />In the wrong hands, this could've played out like a daytime drama, but smart dialog, careful direction, and brilliant performances give the film a clever grace that raise it above the trappings of its plot. Watching Dustin Hoffman obliviously speak out against his own discretions force us to somewhat reevaluate our own views about gender. I can't think of another actor who could've pulled off that character, even those who have given great drag performances (I'm not referring to the Wayans brothers, in case you were wondering). Bill Murray also achieved brilliance as the roommate who does his best to take everything in stride but thinks that maybe \\"we're going into a weird area here.\\" <br /> <br />The eighties-ness might be a little much at times (and I was a little dumbfounded hearing my mother sing along to one of the musical interludes from the next room), but this film is as entertaining as it is contrived. It doesn't logically work (and I'm a little curious how they wrote Hoffman's character off the show after his secret was revealed), but in a film this inspired, who cares? <br />

B0007GAERG|3.0|I remember when Mariah Carey dropped \\"It's Like That\\" earlier this year, I didn't pay a lot of attention to it. It's not a bad song, but it's not her best song either. But when the follow-up single \\"We Belong Together\\" zoomed to #1, I thought that maybe Mariah was finally getting her groove back because she had been slumping ever since Butterfly. But after listening to The Emancipation of Mimi, it's clear that Mariah -- I mean, Mimi is still struggling.<br /><br />The fact that this album has spurned several hit songs yet still received a three-star rating from me coins what I've said before: \\"Well, at least she released the right songs.\\" Yep, the best songs on here are the singles [\\"It's Like That\\", \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Shake It Off\\" and \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" (the latter is actually a bonus track; more on that later)]. And \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" is a nice inspirational ballad that takes me back to her Music Box days when she sang alongside a choir. The rest of the album leaves a LOT to be desired, however.<br /><br />Mariah still seems to think that catering to the younger crowd is a tactic that DOES work for her. This method results in embarrassing uptempo cuts, like the album's worst track, \\"Get Your Number\\" (with Jermaine Dupri). Other failed party joints also feature guest rappers of the moment, like Twista on \\"One and Only\\", Nelly on \\"To the Floor\\", and Snoop Dogg on \\"Say Somethin'\\". By the way, the latter two songs are also obligatory Neptunes tracks.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are basically ballads, and they come off fine but they get buried underneath all that high-school-tailored crap. And there are a few bonus tracks that appear on a few of the re-releases of this album (why any album would have to be re-released three times is beyond me), but with the exception of \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", they almost made me knock down this rating to two-and-a-half stars.<br /><br />While this is far from Mariah's best work, it ironically became the force she needed to restart her career (and at least people are buying it; how many people do you know that own Charmbracelet?). Still, there are too many flaws on the album to call it a real emancipation.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert<br /><br />P.S.

0312330529|5.0|India, drugs, mafia, war -- what could be better?! This book was so awesome. It's like the tough-guy version of A Suitable Boy (in that it's great, hard-to-put-down, long and takes place in India). I wasn't expecting to like this book but ended up LOVING it. Plus, it's kind of based on the author's life, so you realize that most of what is in the book probably happened (making it that much more fun to read!). Even my husband, who usually reads nothing more than STOP signs, is jonesing to read it!
B000B0QOJA|5.0|So here we have another previously unreleased performance by John Coltrane, this time with his own quartet. Even though I am used to hearing music deemed \\"out\\" (Albert Ayler, Ornette Coleman, etc), there's just something about Coltrane. In these performances, the musicians seem to be playing as if it was going to be their last show ever. On the first track, \\"One Down, One Up\\", the intensity reached by the interaction between Coltrane and Elvin is just mindblowing. After the bass intro by Jimmy, it's just non-stop beautiful madness for 25-plus minutes. This tune is definitely a high-point of the album, but the rest is definitely not bad. This is the John Coltrane Quartet at their most extremely uninhibited, their most explosive. Some people prefer Coltrane's \\"calmer\\" material, but for me, these seemingly chaotic explorations provide a deeper, more primal musical experience that just oozes unbridled emotion. The only little gripe I have is the voice-overs by the radio DJ. But, given the nature of radio, that was to be expected. For those who like boundary-smashing improvisational Jazz, this is IT. Enjoy.
B00005JOHI|5.0|Ok...so I've seen the movie ten times, downloaded the screensaver from the official site, bought the soundtrack from Amazon, and I'm reading interviews and the production notes (long, but fascinating), and also reading the book for the second time.<br /><br />Although Colin Firth was sensational in the miniseries, I think it's unfair to compare Matthew MacFadyen with other actors who have played the part. In one of MacFadyen's interviews, he said that you can't allow yourself to be intimidated. Just because great actors have played Hamlet, doesn't mean no one else can play the same character. Each actor brings his own art and interpretation to the character. Why do we have to choose? Can't we enjoy them all? That's what Roger Moore said during an interview when he was asked who was his favorite Bond. He said they are all good. Why do we have to choose?<br /><br />I also read somewhere that Colin Firth was making another movie during the BBC miniseries and had no idea that he was becoming such a sex symbol. He said he tried hard NOT to be sexy in this part.<br /><br />I think this movie version is visually stunning, the music is wonderful, and the dancing is exciting. I thought Simon Woods (Mr. Bingley) was adorable. I read that he and Rosa Pike (Jane Bennet) had gone together for some time and broke up a couple of years ago. Joe Wright, the director, wanted them both for these parts but was afraid it would be painful for them and uncomfortable on the set. But he chose them anyway. They didn't find out until the night before the first day of the shoot. Joe Wright and Rosa are now going together.<br /><br />I thought all the acting was very good, and although I had never heard of Matthew MacFadyen, I fell in love with him during the course of the movie, just as Lizzy did. I really think the most inspired acting job was the character of Mr. Collins. Tom Hollander played him as ridiculous and a bit creepy. I was happy to find his bio on the imdb and see that he is actually handsome, and sexy, with blond wavy hair. If he looked like himself in the movie, she may not have turned him down.<br /><br />This was Tamzin Merchant's (Georgiana) first acting part. She is a huge Jane Austen fan and wrote to the casting director that she would be perfect for that part. She even learned to play the piano.<br /><br />I, too, wish the movie was longer...perhaps another hour, and would like to have seen Mr. Wickham's character more developed.<br /><br />In the production notes, they thought of Darcy as a tragic/tortured character. His parents die while he is still young and he inherits this huge estate to manage and must raise a young sister. He had to take on a lot of responsibility at an early age.<br /><br />Keira Knightley says that the girls socialized easily with the cast, until they got dressed up. She said the men were so sexy in their outfits that the females couldn't even put sentences together.<br /><br />Austen's writing is an interesting style. It's not grammatically correct and there are spelling errors. But it's difficult to put the book down. Most of the text is dialogue. It reads like script. And the book is posted online in several places. If you missed some dialogue because the British accent, just check out the book online.<br /><br />Also in the production notes, they mention that Austen wrote P&P during the French Revolution, where the underclass revolted against the upper class, and American just won  independence from England. At that time, the upper class was encouraged to socialize with the middle class to avoid unrest. Bingley had no problem, but Darcy and Caroline Bingley found it difficult.<br /><br />All in all, I think they did a beautiful job with the movie. I love the story and the characters. I'm anxious to see all versions. I own the Greer Garson/Lawrence Olivier version, the 6-hour miniseries, both Bridget Jones movies, and I can't wait until this DVD becomes available (February 2, I think). I also own an Austen boxed set of British productions (haven't seen them yet). I just saw the P&P movie with Orlando Seale and Kam Heskin. It's so silly that it's actually funny. Haven't seen Bride and Prejudice yet, but it's on cable this month.). I also own an Austen boxed set of British productions (haven't seen them yet).

B000B7BRMM|5.0|Swingy and spot on. The band is great. The arrangements are a perfect update from the originals. Diana does an excellent interpretation. Perhaps some of the songs are a bit melancholy, but I love this Christmas album. It's a warm fire, some snow falling outside, the smell of pine, and a crinkly pile of wrapping paper every time I put it on.
B00030590I|3.0|The only reason I give this film 3 stars is due to its magnificent visual accomplishments.  The visual effects leave the viewer mesmerized and brings the film out of the gutter, but otherwise Hero is a monumental disappointment not even in the same league as other recent hits such as \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and the like.  The film's theme is boring, tedious, arrogant, and morally suspect.  The moral of the story is that the means justify the ends, and if the means involve pillage, murder, coercion, and forced conformity then the end result, which is ultimately Chinese unification, is justified.  If you agree with this sort of logic, then you will more than likely love the film.  This, in combination with the visual acrobatics, will dazzle you.  But if you value the individual, if you value free will and a person's inherent right to determine one's own future without excessive extraneous external influence, if you despise the insanity of blind nationalism and the megalomania associated with the imperialistic impulse, then I doubt you will enjoy this film.  I certainly didn't....

I appreciate the gift, thank you Paul, but I couldn't get into this book at all.  Chance happens.  It isn't that hidden unless you have your head buried in the sand.  Emotions happen.  Contemplation happens.  Discipline happens. <br />This author seems like one confused soul.  He glumps everything he can't understand, and perhaps even more, into randomness.

B00002E233|4.0|I am well aware of the flaws in this movie, but to truly appreciate it, you must understand its great strength. bear with me. First, so you know where my info comes from. I'm a diver, and when I was about 8 or 9 my oldest brother brought home a book on sharks which included a rather large appendix of recorded attacks. My love and fascination of sharks and the seas was born. Since then I got into diving and love photographing sharks which are truly beautiful and awesome in their own habitat. I have even worked with a few while volunteer diving for Marineland (The first marine aquarium in the world, the pioneer of the field, and one which has been brought to the brink of closing by places like Disney and Sea World but yet remains open). In the fourth or fifth grade I also took on mythology which includes oceanic civilizations who worshipped sharks as gods. Sorry for the longwindedness but I'm working my way to the point. <br /> <br />Jaws was an excellent story but written at a time when sharks were still very misunderstood. Even Benchley, in retrospect, regrets writing it because it gave sharks a bad name. Keep in mind that his expertise came from being involved with sharks and working on documentaries such as \\"Blue Water, White Death\\". Therefore, he knew how fictitious his story was, but never counted on people taking it for the gospel. Since that time it has been discovered that the vast majority of white shark attacks were not white sharks at all, but bull sharks. So the white shark has since lost a lot of its bad reputation to a shark that is worldwide and even comes to live in fresh water. Unfortunately, the general public doesn't follow these things but hopefully Discovery's \\"Shark Week\\" parades of info will eventually change that and even make people realize shark attacks are accidents and these movies are just fictitious stories. That was Jaws, now on to Deep Blue. <br /> <br />In recent years studies have been conducted on mako sharks which are the kind in the movie. The general belief about sharks is that they are brainless eating machines. True, most are likely outdone by most mammals alive, but not the mako. The mako is the PERFECT shark for such a work of fiction as Deep Blue. Why? Because they are the smartest of the sharks as it is. How smart is that? They likely learn more swiftly than your favorite dog. They can even set instinct aside as a choice made by thought. This may not sound so spectacular but it is a clear sign of intelligence, especially in a wild animal. It is in the wild that these studies were done. Now add their natural speed of up to approximately 60 MPH and their general fearlessness to the point of being known to attack boats. They have even jumped into boats for who knows what reasons. <br /> <br />Add these factors together, then multiply by four (makos are only about 10-12 feet long naturally) for the size differential. Now what do you have? A damned smart shark that fears nothing short of a ship (okay, maybe that's a bit extreme but you get the point), and has the speed and strength to cover distance in an instant and smash through most anything that isn't made especially strong and can swallow a person and barely notice. <br /> <br />Look up information on the extinct carcharadon megalodon if you'd like visual aid to imagine size. That shark had a tooth length of about 6-7 inches whereas a big white shark has teeth about 2-2 1/2 inches long. A shark the size of those in Deep Blue would even undoubtedly feed on killer whales. And most likely, nothing could contest its rule of the seas when full grown. <br /> <br />A final note to any reading this far. The movie \\"Open Water\\" is a rag. Whether you like the way it was filmed or not, the shark attack ending is nothing but a work of exploitation. They don't know what happened to them and threw sharks in because, quite frankly, sharks sell. And quite frankly, every dive boat I have been on has been either very efficient or very inefficient. I have yet to see one display efficiency like that in the movie, but not check role call again later. I'm not saying there aren't any like that, but I haven't seen any. <br /> <br />Sorry for rambling so long. I had many people ask me a lot about sharks after watching Deep Blue and appreciated it much better afterwards. So just thought I'd try and help to understand it.

B000BYRCH4|4.0|I don't think I have ever watched a movie for reasons that have been stated here. Besides, though Walker may or may not do a nude scene in his career, Alba isn't likely to unless it is something she wants to do. She has fame now, and doesn't need to do nude scenes.  <br /> <br />Besides, as the burlesque \\"stripper\\" Gypsy Rose Lee, I believe was her name, proved it's not what you see, but what you don't see. She was the stripper most everyone wished to see, undoubtedly the most successful, but she never revealed herself. She was nude but did the \\"fan dance\\" and she cleverly used the fans to always block her body from view. Alba is certainly a pleasure to the eyes, but, leave her clothes on and wonder at what lies beneath. Once an actress takes them off, the wonder is gone because now you know what you could only imagine previously and wished you knew. Fulfill the wish and it becomes just a memory. <br /> <br />What caught my attention was the storyline which reminded me of The Deep. Into The Blue is really just a rehash of The Deep, but most definitely a good rehash of it. True, the wrecks aren't stacked, but they're pretty close to it. Watch the movie, it's good. Watch the actors, but try leaving their clothes on and you'll get a much better experience from this one. As for the stunning underwater footage, well, I'm a diver and can sum it up with the words of Johnny Depp as \\"Captain\\" Jack Sparrow - \\"Welcome to the Caribbean\\". Water clarity in the Caribbean gets to about 200 foot visibility and coupled with the tone of color, often looks like water in a nice clean pool.
6305428042|5.0|Halloween has never been this hilarious. Disney has always had a way with making great family movies, but HOCUS POCUS just tops all famiy movies. <br /> <br />    On October 31st, 1693 in the small town of Salem, Massachutsets, three witch sisters: WINIFRED SANDERSON (played by Bette Midler), SARAH SANDERSON (played by Sarah Jessica Parker), & MARY SANDERSON (played by Kathy Najimy) have kidnapped a little girl by the name of EMILY BINX. Her brother, THACKERY BINX (played by Sean Murray) has followed them to their little house, hidden deep in the woods. Sipping a potion they have made especially for her, Thackery appears and tries to save his little sister, but he is too late, for this potion has brought Emily's life force, where they suck out her life, which turns the Sanderson sisters from old to young. As punishment for stumbling upon the sisters and nearly foiling their plan, Winifred and her sisters transform Thackery into a black cat for all eternity. At that moment, the villagers of Salem, led by Thackery and Emily's mother and father, grab the sisters and ready them to be hung in front of the Salem townfolk. At that moment, Winifred's book of evil spells and potions lets it be known, silently, that on Halloween Night, a virgin shall resurrect the witches. After Winifred informs the town of her curse, they are hanged and killed. <br /> <br />    It is now October 31s, 1993, Halloween, 300 years after the Sanderson sisters were killed. There is a new kid in town named MAX DENNISON (played by Omri Katz). He has moved to Salem with his mother and father (played by Charles Rockett and Stephanie Faracy), and his little sister, DANI (played by Thora Birch) from L.A. Max is having trouble adjusting to the small town of Salem. After leaving school, Max has a little conversation with the beautiful ALISON (played by Vanessa Shaw), who Max goes to school with. Max has crush on Alison, for Alison likes Max too, but is a little shy. On his way home, Max runs into twobullies, who rob him of his sneakers, putting more of a bitterness in Max. <br /> <br />    Two or three hours later, Max and Dani head out to go trick or treating. They have a brief argument, but Max, feeling sorry for treating Dani badly, makes up with her. They head into a huge house. They find that this huge house is the residence of Alison. The three talk for awhile and find that Alison's mother used to own the Sanderson Sisters' Museum, which was actually the Sanderson's little old house. Max thinks it's a good idea to go. The three head out to the house where Alison gives them a tour. They find Winifred's book locked in a glass case, where Max finds the black-flamed candle. The candle, when lit on Halloween night with a full-moon in the black sky, will awaken the Sanderson sisters. His stupidity leads Max into lighting the candle, where Winifred, Sarah, and Mary return. They have a brief outting with the sisters, where Max tells Alison and Dani to head out, where he'll catch up. As he leaves, he runs into...Thackery Binx. Turns out Thackery is still in the form of a cat, but he has the ability to talk. Binx decides to help out the kids, where has Max steal Winifred's book. <br /> <br />    The Sanderson sisters fly out to find the kids and Binx. They are at a nearby cemetery, where Binx shows the kids the grave of a man named BILLY BUTCHERSON (played by Doug Jones). Billy was Winnie's boyfriend, but she found him one day fooling around with Sarah, forcing Winifred to kill Billy. Binx then shows the kids the grave of his beloved sister, Emily, where tells them of what happened to her. But at that moment, the sisters arrive and wreck more havoc, including resurrecting Billy Butcherson. <br /> <br />    The kids arrive at the townhall party, where they try to tell Mr. and Mrs. Dennison about this, but the sisters show up and break into a song and dance, putting a spell on all of the party to DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! UNTIL YOU DIE! The kids escape into the high school and try torching the sisters, but they escape as the kids sleep at Max and Dani's house. Alison and Max head downstairs, ready to walk Alison home, but they hear noise from upstairs. They find the book in missing and find that the sisters have Dani. They explode on out through the roof and head out on their way. Mary and Winifred head on home, where Sarah, through singing, has all the children of Salem in a trance, where they will head over to the Sanderson house to have their lives sucked by the sisters. At that moment, Alison remembers what Winifred had said just before they took Dani with them. She tells Max that Winifred had said the candle's magic will soon be spent and Dawn approaches. This means that the black-flamed candle only brought the witches back for this one Halloween Night. They have to steal the lives of children to in their youth and remain immortal. If they cannot do that in time, they will explode to dust when the sun rises. <br /> <br />    As the sisters try to make Dani drink the potion, Max enters and saves Dani. But Winifred realizes that he has tricked the sisters again, where they head out after Alison, Dani, and Max back to the cemetery. The kids run into Billy Butcherson, but they find he only wants to help the kids defeat the sisters. Winifred actually kills Binx in the process, but they cannot get the kids in time, for the sun has come up and turned the sisters into dust. The witches are dead, Thackery's soul is free, where he is reunited with Emily. <br /> <br />    This movie was a really fun-filled movie for all kids. Some images maybe a little frightening, but your children will really enjoy this film. I have enjoyed this film since I was eight years old. A definite family classic.
076790592X|5.0|As a critical care nurse, I share the last days and minutes of many peoples lives with them and their loved ones. Oh, to be able to die with dignity and surrounded with love as Morrie does in this book. A man who faced dying for what it is -- a passage, not necessarily an ending; an opportunity to teach and to learn. The best part for me (as a nurse) is his family loved him enough to not prolong his agony, but to let him die with dignity. Oh, but to be loved that much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I have been a long time Enya fan. I have always found her music very soothing and comforting to listen to. After a lengthy five year absence since \\"A Day Without Rain\\", Enya finally released her new album \\"Amarantine\\" late last year. It is another gorgeous collection of new age. Her voice remains as breathtaking as ever. I was grateful that on this album, the length of the album was a bit longer than its predecessor which I thought was too short. I was immediately enchanted with the album the second I heard her Ahhh'ing on the opening track \\"Less than a Pearl\\". The title track is simply classic Enya. It is a beautiful song. \\"It's in the Rain\\" sounded like it could have easily fit in with the other songs on \\"The Celts\\". \\"If I Could Be Where You Are\\" is a beautiful, intricate ballad that has a folk element to it that I enjoyed immensely. This song would have been perfect for The Lord of the Rings soundtrack. It has that mythical, folklore element like her song that she contributed to the first LOTR soundtrack. All of the songs on this album is enchanting. I admit it took me a few listens for the album to grow one me unlike her earlier albums but \\"Amarantine\\" proved to be just as enjoyable. People harp on Enya for never branching out with her music. Enya is like the hard rock band AC/DC. Why change something if it ain't broken? I think that could be said the same about Enya's music. If she did change her sound, would it still sound good? I enjoyed \\"Amarantine\\" immensely. I hope I don't have to wait to long to hear more music from this lovely chanteuse.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about...this album is one of my all time favorites. It is different from everything else out there. I saw them live and i was blown away. Its experimental and catchy...i can't even explain. These guys are only 18 and 19 years old and to make this good of an album on the first try is incredible. They even have accordian in some parts.. come on. Who thinks of that?? These days in music everyone strives to be different and P!ATD has hit the mark. Buy this CD!!!! <br /> <br />Favorite tracks- <br />I write sins not tragedies- my favorite favorite <br />but its better if you do  <br />time to dance
B000AADYRQ|1.0|I love DC4QT.  Have been a fan for YEARS!  I love when bands do there thing and do it well.  I enjoy the fact that they make money and final one day get signed onto a major label.  I hate the fact that the label makes them.  They turn there music into junk.  If you like DC4Qt then buy there older albums.  Ones that don't include someguy in a fancy leather chair sayin .... no that is no good give me the pop crap.  This album is horriable.  I regrete buying it.  But... buy there olders stuff!
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is a great CD. The music is great and has excellent vocals by one of the best singers in the world. Her vocals may not be the same as they use to be but she can still belt it out like nonother. She has an amazing range which is showcased in songs like \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Circles\\" and by far the best song on the CD is \\"We Belong Together\\".  I don't know why people feel the need to compare her to Mary J. Blige and Madonna.  They are their own unique talents.  We are not here to compare but to review the music.  Great Job Mariah!
B00005JLEU|5.0|<br />\\"Spirited Away\\" is one of the most profound animated movies ever made. It's simple enough to attract the youngest viewers, yet deep enough to be read between the lines by the adult audience. As many of the reviewers noticed, the movie characters are non-cliched and multi-dimensional, which makes the Japanese feature stand out from the other animated ones. Also I'd like to mention the English dubbing is extremely well done - it perfectly reflects the soul of the original. Daveigh Chase (of \\"Lilo and Stitch\\") voicing Chihiro gives a very moving and memorable performance, so does Suzanne Pleshette as a perfectly rough witch Yubaba. I also loved Susan Egan (Broadway B&B's Belle and Megara of Disney's \\"Hercules\\") as Lin - she was just wonderful. Flawless voice acting plus the amazing animation and original story really stand for the movie's brilliance. Anyone, no matter the age, should see \\"Spirited Away\\" - it will truly inspire you.
B00004KD1L|4.0|\\"Vertigo\\" has its share of high moments, but it also has some pretty terrible songs (mainly just the hit single \\"I See You Baby\\". It gets annoying after a while, and compared to the rest of the album it's pretty subpar. \\"If Everybody Looked The Same\\" would've been a better single). It also has some noticable filler, unfortunately. Despite this, there are definitely very good groovy tunes on this album that make it a satisfying purchase. \\"Whatever, Whenever\\" and \\"Serve Chilled\\", for example, are excellent tracks. Some songs tend to settle for some cheesy lyrics or instrumentation, but the ones that try hard to be good definitely hit their target. Overall an uneven album, but I still think it's a worthy purchase. Overrated maybe, but still slightly recommended.  <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />\\"Chicago\\" <br />\\"Whatever, Whenever\\" <br />\\"Dusk, You & Me\\" <br />\\"Serve Chilled\\" <br />\\"If Everybody Looked The Same\\" <br />\\"A Private Interlude\\" (to an extent) <br />\\"I See You Baby\\" (even though it gets old after a while) <br />\\"At The River\\" (parts of it)
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban is one of the best male singers out there today.  This is an excellent CD that showcases his wonderful talent.  Every song is great but highlights include \\"Oceano\\", \\"Remember When It Rained\\" and the inspirational \\"You Raise Me Up\\".  With CD's like this I know he will have a very long and prosperous career. Great Job!
B0002OERI0|5.0|The impact of Green Day's super-hit breakthrough album, Dookie, is reestablished every time another cookie-cutter pop-punk band lands another song in another hour-long WB teen drama. Whether or not the band, themselves, are responsible for this is open to debate - I, personally, don't think they can be blamed, but I know people who do - but the fact is that Billie Joe Armstrong and company haven't said much of anything about it, one way or the other. In fact, if one looked on the punk landscape recently, it's safe to say that Green Day wouldn't have really registered that much at all amid the sea of its own imitators. The group's last original album, Warning, came out in 2000, and even with a 2001 greatest hits release doing moderately well, many listeners were left wondering if these guys had anything left in the tank.<br /><br />All of that is different now that American Idiot has arrived. The latest release from Green Day is their most complex, fully-realized work to date, and it's probably the most ambitious rock record since Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Like the much-lauded alt-country pioneers, Green Day has twisted the conventions of its chosen genre into something that stands apart from its contemporaries. It's a concept album - yes, a full-length story told over the course of a record's running time, framed by two nine-plus minute, multi-part epics. It's the most defined statement about suburban angst yet made by a group that has made singing about suburban angst a specialty. And it's also a really good listen, full of catchy melodies and the kind of musical complexity you might not expect out of a punk band.<br /><br />The \\"plot,\\" as it were, of American Idiot isn't as clear as that of other famous rock operas, such as the Who's Tommy. Rather than tell a direct start-to-finish story, the album seems to be more about an idea - the idea that, under the seemingly apathetic sheen of modern suburban America, there lies a rage and desire for control that's being smothered by chain stores and mass media. Think of it as 1984, but with shopping malls. Certain characters recur - Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy, and a girl named Whatsername - but they serve more as the embodiment of the band's expression of frustration and a desire to break free of society's norms. But there is something of an arc, with St. Jimmy and Whatsername following the Jesus of Suburbia's preachings about the dead-end nature of their respective lives to their own ends. Hey, it's not, Les Miserables, but it works.<br /><br />But don't let all this stuff about theme and plot scare you off - unlike some groups that attempt concept albums, Green Day haven't forgotten their sense of economy. All of these tunes hit hard and cut to the chase. \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\" each clock in at over nine minutes, sure, but they're both subdivided into parts, most of which could almost stand alone as their own song. Razor-sharp guitar work permeates it all, making sure noise isn't sacrificed for thematic purposes. Tre Cool's drums come in rapid-fire volleys, and you never get the feeling that the band is just filling time - something too many groups do on normal records, let alone those that aim for something experimental.s being smothered by chain stores and mass media.

B000003S5H|5.0|\\"Moon Safari\\" isn't perfect, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a very influential and fun album. The first song, for example,  easily sounds like it was done by a live band, but in fact it's all digital. Knowing this makes the experience infinitely more interesting. Sadly, not every track is fun like on \\"Talkie Walkie\\", not that there are bad songs, but the ones that are great trump the rest (\\"La Femme d'Argent\\" especially). This also, obviously, hurts the experience if you're trying to listen to it from start-to-finish. All things aside, it's a very entertaining and satisfying album with great historical value. Highly recommended!  <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />\\"La Femme d'Argent\\" <br />\\"All I Need\\" <br />\\"Talisman\\" <br />\\"Ce Matin-La\\" <br />\\"New Star in the Sky (Chanson Pour Solal)\\"  <br />\\"Le Voyage de Penelope\\" (parts of it)
0679731725|5.0|The spolight reviewer who called Kazuo Ishiguro's masterpiece \\"deceptively simple\\" got it spot on.  This is a brilliant book, ideally realized.<br /><br />The tone of \\"Remains of the Day\\" is set immediately in the first paragraph, when the protagonist, butler Stevens, goes on rather obsessively about a small journey he's about to undertake.  Over the pages that follow, we see and listen to Stevens overanalyze everything to the point of absurdity, but - as we slowly find out - his attention to detail and duty has resulted in a dually tragic \\"can't see the forest for the trees\\" lifetime of missed opportunity.<br /><br />Indeed (as Mr. Ishiguro would surely preface), his blind sense of devotion to his employer has prevented Stevens from seeing the man's tragic missteps; and, he's completely bollixed up clear signals of romantic interest from Miss Kenton (idelibly portrayed on-screen by Emma Thompson).  The author's triumph is that he manages to convey both these disappointments whiile never breaking the stride of Stevens' perspective of remembrance.  It's no wonder Ishiguro's best work ran off with the UK's prestigious Booker Prize.<br /><br />You've got to imagine that when the production team of James Ivory, Ismail Merchant and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala got their hands on \\"Remains of the Day\\" when it came out in 1989, they must have thought they'd died and gone to heaven.  Along with \\"Howard's End,\\" the 1993 film version of the book captures the essence of the Merchant-Ivory production house style.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I haven't heard the other two soundtracks but I KNOW that this one is an absolute gem. Every track is extremely emotional and conjures up very pleasant memories of the films. Howard Shore is at his prime here with a ton of memorable compositions (and for a movie that's very hard to do). If you're a fan of this kind of music or if you're a lord of the rings nut you'll no doubt love this CD. <br /> <br />Hightlights include: <br />the entire album!
B000BW7QWW|3.0|My overly dramatic opening statement is completely false, if this film wanted to divide the nation, it would have to actually be seen by the public. Serenity bombed at the box office but for the people who have seen it, they can be divided into two camps. Fan boys who have an unhealthy fixation with Joss Whedon of all people and the other camp is the general, all purpose hater who despises anything that might be remotely different from the status quo. Allow me to be the voice of reason as I am not of either camp, not a Whedon fan, nor a hater. <br /> <br />No one can possibly claim Serenity is off the beaten path, unique or should enjoy cult-like status, this movie is a highly predictable space adventure of the kind you've seen or heard countless times before. What makes this movie somewhat different is the writer/director Whedon's light touch. Whedon has certainly seen too many westerns and sci-fi movies, he's read too many adventure novels and comic books and he's seen countless hours of television and been the producer of countless hours of television. Whedon knows what he's about, he's ironic, he's smart and in Serenity he shows himself a capable director. <br /> <br />Serenity is very breezy, tongue in cheek, full of humor, sharp as a knife dialogue and even dramatic at the appropriate places. In it's own way, this film is more satisfying than Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. I still have reservations about Serenity because the final act is somewhat cliche ridden, we know at least one of the crew has to die for instance. It devolves into a terrific made for cable TV movie in the last half hour, like a cheesy sci-fi channel flick with a big budget. Don't take those words too harshly, as Serenity is still very entertaining and will quench your thirst for a decent sci-fi movie, just don't expect anything on the caliber of Blade Runner and you'll have a pleasant experience.
B00013RC9I|4.0|This album is no \\"Moon Safari\\" (as far as musicianship and creativity goes), but at least it's very entertaining. As opposed to \\"Moon Safari\\", however, there's no \\"filler\\" (although I suppose a better way of saying it is that all the songs are equally good) which is great if you're trying to listen to the album straight through. The only downside, though, is that the songs aren't as influential or great as the ones on \\"Moon Safari\\" (but really, who would expect them to be?). Nevertheless they are very entertaining, even if some of them are a kind of guilty pleasure (such as \\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\"). However, if you like Air or electro-pop in general you will most likely enjoy this album, though not as much as \\"Moon Safari\\" (at least you'll recognize that the best tracks on that album are much better than the best tracks on here). Definitely one of 2004's better albums. Highly recommended!    Highlights include:   the entire album!
B000AARKOO|2.0|My review heading is a bit misleading, I don't hate this movie nearly as much as you think. How can someone hate such a trite, safe, easily digestable Hollywood blockbuster such as Kingdom of Heaven? Ridley Scott is primarily known for his visual style, he's a visualist. He himself says he enjoys creating worlds on film. Places you've never been to, some other places that don't even exist in films like Blade Runner, Legend and Alien. However Ridley Scott is not a political filmmaker like Oliver Stone for instance, so what the hell is Ridley doing tackling this thorny subject matter in Kingdom of Heaven? Middle Eastern war and ethnic tension is not conducive to the Ridley Scott approach to cinema. This film is a beautiful looking, spiritually empty, politically correct Hollywood movie, the kind you've seen way too often and know in advance what to except.    Ridley Scott or the producers of this movie are supposed to be impartial in this sensitive material but they are clearly not. The Christians in this film fall into basically two camps, the evil psychopaths and the emotionally distant, quasi-agnostics. The Muslims in this film are portrayed much more sympathetically, they are all good and noble people, including the leader Saladin! In the special features documentary, the historians state that Saladin allowed to leave unharmed, only the Christians who could pay their way out of Jerusalem. Thousands of Christians who could not pay their way out were sold into slavery! But of course you can't show that in a politically correct movie, Saladin is a hero! There is only one Muslim guy in the whole film who is perhaps clamoring for war, but even he is portrayed quite nobly. Half the Christians are totally evil murderers, the other half are the Orlando Bloom type who have basically lost their faith in God and are just fighting to stay alive or something. The character motivations in this film are pathetic, Orlando Bloom decides he wants to save his dead wife's soul ( shekilled herself because their child died ), so he goes to Jerusalem with his father, once his father dies, Bloom decides to maintain his father's ideals, then those ideals become meaningless to him but he still stays on to fight for Jerusalem for no purpose. In the meantime he also has sex with some married whore by the name of Sybilla. Nice way of honoring your wife's memory! Sybilla tells Bloom's character Balian that she is not a wicked whore and is not simply bored, she sleeps with him because in Jerusalem, there is only light between two people! What? Huh? Whore! This is a really deep perspective on the inner workings of the human psyche, Ridley! NOT!     Gladiator was a simplistic film with a simplistic character motivation device, the device was REVENGE. That's one of the most basic character motivations you can think of and it works! It worked in Gladiator, even though the film wasn't great, it was very entertaining. Kingdom of Heaven does not have access to such a simple plot scheme, which means it should approach it's delicate subject matter with greater intelligence. It fails on those levels completely. It's not even entertaining, it just meanders in this hazy field of lukewarm empathy. Ridley Scott also bogs down the battle scenes with slow-motion all the time, probably to send the message that war is pointless and stupid, ( which it is ), but this Hollywood treatment of war just doesn't cut it. The music that plays over the battle scenes is so tacky and pleading, it's laughable. Harry Gregson-Williams is the composer of the score and he uses all the old ticks of the trade that Hollywood musicians know so well. Ridley Scott has practically used the same method in Black Hawk Down and Gladiator as far as music mixed with images go, plenty of slow-mo action coupled with silly, pandering music trying to tell you that oh, war and fighting and killing is so bad!     This film can only be recommended to people who like easy, simplistic, predictable stories catered to you by Hollywood without the slightest hint of controversial material, well except for the constant Christian bashing, Hollywood loves that!    Wouldn't it have made a much more interesting film if Orlando Bloom goes to the place where Christ was crucified, ( he does this in the film ), but instead of whining like a baby that God didn't talk to him, he instead is filled with crazy religious fervor, like some nutty fundamentalist and then Bloom goes ballistic and wages a huge war against Saladin. Saladin ultimately triumphs but not before Bloom's character Balian screams, \\" You may take my life but you will never take my immortal soul, you heathen scum!\\" Now, that would be a lot more of a passionate film, don't you think? Hahaha! Also when Sybilla approaches Balian romantically, Balian should say, \\" Begone you wicked whore, I love only my wife, even if she is only a memory, she is still better than a whore like you!\\" I'm a man and I know that it's difficult for us guys to turn down sex so Orlando Bloom would be a hero if his character could muster up that courage.     I enjoyed seeing Jeremy Irons in the movie and I have to say that Edward Norton as the masked King was the best part of the whole film, unfortunately Ridley Scott does not know the concept of directorial restraint because he ultimately reveals the king's disfigured face. If you're an intelligent filmmaker, don't strip your characters of their dignity, especially when the character actually demands it on his deathbed!    Ridley Scott is a wonderful filmmaker, everyone has their ups and downs, right? Yes indeed, Ridley is so much better than his brother Tony Scott, who is a complete moron 95 percent of the time!      Good day to you all!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen's self-titled debut essentially launched hard rock into the mainstream, and rightfully so. Even though the lyrics are kind of sub-par, the hooks are infectious and the songs are entertaining. The musicianship is extremely good every song (I like the guitar solo, \\"Eruptions\\", especially), and the energy here is just awesome. Every track here is just hard rock gold. The remastering was also really well done here. The acoustic \\"Ice Cream Man\\" is also a pretty funny addition after an onslaught of pounding hard rock songs. David Lee Roth is also one of the best hard rock singers ever and definitely helps make the songs great. A highly recommended album for hard rock fans as well as music collectors/historians. If you like this album I also highly recommend AC/DC's \\"Back In Black.\\"     Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|Great family movies can be hard to find. Sky High has a rare combination of humor, action, and plot. Sky High also addressed issues around family, the struggles that a teen will face in high school. Any one looking for a great family film this is the one. I would love it if Disney would make a series of sequels, after all this was just their freshman year. Sky High is light, fun, and depicts morals and values (once again something many films are seriously lacking). Sky High is fun for all ages; personally I prefer it to the Harry Potter films for family entertainment. I highly recommend this movie. If you want a clean, safe movie for the family you won't be disappointed!!!
0812550706|2.0|How on Earth this book is a Nebula and Hugo Award winner is passed me. What a terribly boring book that revolves around a final twist that drops in at about page 300 and does not justify anything else that came before it. The ending also just pops out of nowhere. Military science-fiction is certainly a very tough piece of wordy action sequences to stomach when compared to the heady wine offerings of most of the top science-fiction authors. Maybe teenagers or first time science-fiction readers will find this book amusing or even identify with the central character of a kid who is being trained by space marines by practising war games to eventually fight an alien threat. The whole book is just a series of `Ender Wiggin wakes up and goes to a battle room to train and fight' and then goes back to bed. This sequence of events is just repeated over and over with nothing to test the intellect. Then there is the final battle and a very silly ending. That is all there is to it. Its popularity lies with kids and Mormons and probably Amazon.com with all the reviews, but that is it. Trying to find it on science fiction fan lists is near impossible but book sales seems to have earned it a Nebula and Hugo although I would question if the judges really read the book. Something this mundane and simple can hardly be justified as good science fiction let alone, top science fiction. I wonder if a single person here has ever heard of Ray Bradbury or Philip K. Dick. My advise is to avoid this one like the plague unless you are 12 and love military science-fiction.
044651652X|5.0|If you can relate this story to your own life, you'll probably love this book, and it'll bring you to tears.  If not, they'll probably be tears of boredom.  Morality aside, it's probably the best novel of it's type ever written, and although I hate romance novels, I loved this book.  Someone gave me a copy, and I knew it had been on the bestseller lists forever, so I started reading it and couldn't put it down.  Makes you want to reach out and pat these poor people on the head for what they suffered through.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Suspenseful action movie with Angelina Jolie and Iain Glen. Beautiful landscape scenery, thrilling action and a lot of irony. Appealing movie performance of a computer game.
B000000W5N|5.0|With guitarists Mick Taylor and Keith Richards in the lineup for \\"Sticky Fingers\\", The Rolling Stones proved that they could rock, rumble, and sway like no other band.  The song selection for this album is very consistent, with the only dud (my opinion) being \\"You Gotta Move\\".  That said, the rest of the songs are definitely satisfying. <br />    Not only are the songs skillfully selected, but they are arranged in a very meticulous way.  \\"Sticky Fingers\\" hits the ground running with the number-one hit \\"Brown Sugar\\" as the title track, which is followed by the powerhouse, string-backed tune \\"Sway\\".  The moody, unforgettable \\"Wild Horses\\" changes the pace of the album, but in a good way.  \\"Wild Horses\\" is like a water-break from a hard cross-country practice, or any fast-paced activity (hopefully that simile worked, but if it didn't, I apologize).  \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking?\\", the longest song on the entire album, puts \\"Sticky Fingers\\" back on the fast track with an opening guitar riff that makes even today's best guitarists sound like amateurs.  Then, of course, there's the previously-mentioned \\"You Gotta Move\\".  If \\"Wild Horses\\" is the water-break, then the fifth track of this album is the nap after practice; it's just plain boring. <br />     The pace briefly returns to its hard-rocking beginnings with the immortal \\"Bitch\\".  From there, the pace gets rather interesting, as it jumps from crescendo-heavy blues (\\"I Got the Blues\\") to spooky drug anthem (\\"Sister Morphine\\") to cruise-control country (\\"Dead Flowers\\") and ends with another blues-influenced song (\\"Moonlight Mile) that, to me, sounds strangely Oriental; thanks to the way that the guitar and piano/keyboards sound together.  As erratic as this combination sounds, it all blends together well. <br />     \\"Sticky Fingers\\", in the long run, is a must-own for any Rolling Stones fan.  Hopefully, someone out there will realize that to buy this CD, he/she will have to move at a faster pace than the one exhibited on \\"You Gotta Move\\".     <br />
0783233477|5.0|Romantic movie with Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani and Anthony Hopkins. Death takes a holiday on Earth, and promptly falls in love. Under these circumstances even for death it is hard to let go. A highly lovable personification of death!
0792844882|4.0|All one has to do is observe how the mainstream media and critics deal with nudity.  They translate their discomfort into criticism.  This movie was no exception.  I first saw the R rated version and hated it.  There seemed to be too many ubrupt cuts.  Then, I saw the unrated version and the flow was so much smoother. <br /> <br />Granted not all of the acting was award caliber but Gershon stood out and some of Berkley's acting was noteworthy.  Three instances stand out.  Twice when someone put her in a humiliating situation, first when ordered to apply ice to her nipples and then with Gershon while the two are rehearsing after lunch.  Each time she goes to the brink, so to say, and then her self-esteem kicks in and she storms away after an emotional response.  The third was when she knocked Gershon down the steps and got to take over from her. <br /> <br />Maybe the movie was not award material but it was far better than the savage treatment it and Berkely received.  To me it was a reflection more on the inability of the critics to deal with their own emotions and less with their ability to objectively rate this movie.
B00003CXIY|5.0|Entertaining comedy with Breckin Meyer, Amy Smart and others. Accidentally Josh sends the video recording of his sexual bit on the side with the pretty Beth to his girlfriend Tiffany. Now, with three colleagues, he goes for the long trip in order to catch the video recording, before Tiffany receives it. Much joy in naked scenes and in less appetizing scenes. Great fun movie.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Okay I've been reading through these reviews and I'd like to rebuttle some of these remarks from other reviewers.  What's wrong with being 47 and releasing an album full of club/dance tracks?  Madge looks damn good for her age, and hey if she wants to feel young, why stop her?  47 is NOT that old anymore people- I hope I have those good looks and high energy levels when I get to that point- you're not required to become an old prune just because you reach a certain number, that's bull.   <br /> <br />Okay, having that said, I love this album!  Understandably, it's not for everyone.  This album is pure fun, somewhat superficial, and meant to be happy-go-lucky.  It is an antithesis of her darker, politically strong contented album 'American Life'...people responded in various ways to American Life.  So for the next album, Madonna decided to do something fun, no sappy ballads, no contraversial material, just fun fun fun.  I do admit, some of the lyrics need some help, especially on I Love New York.  But maybe this was intentional.  People don't have to be deep and philosophical 24/7, just take two seconds off from being a deep thinker who criticizes everything, and just ENJOY it!!  I like the tracks- but I don't really care for Like It Or Not, Future Lovers, and How High. The other tracks I love.   <br /> <br />So bottom line people- just stop bashing Madonna because of her age, 47 is NOT old, just enjoy the music and wonder what she'll be putting out two years from now, and don't expect something similar.  If you aren't sure about whether or not to purchase 'confessions', just go to iTunes and download a couple of tracks to get a feel for the album.  Oh and by the way, the photos inside the cover are pretty amusing- she attempts to position herself in some very suggestive poses, but ends up looking like she has to pass gas instead.  I think that would be the main flaw in this album, is the choice of photos for the cover.
0767817710|5.0|Entertaining western comedy with Sharon Stone, Russell Crowe and Gene Hackman. A woman takes revenge on a small town tyrant for the assassination of her father. Shooting competition with one duel after the other. Western parody with a female gunslinger in the leading part. Many beautiful close-ups. <br />
0553801503|1.0|I only came across the 'Song Of Ice & Fire' series about 4 months ago, thanks to Amazon reviews from people like you, and reading the first three volumes in very quick succession was a trip, truly. I was engrossed, amazed and plain impressed at the many webs that Martin was able to weave. Like everyone, I took to my favourite characters and my most hated, and 'A Storm Of Swords' shocked me not only in WHO it killed off, but how. One character in particular, ahem, R, I really didn't expect to see killed off, especially not in such a horrible, brutal way. I also love that Martin pulled in narrations from some new characters in 'A Storm Of Swords,' especially Jaime the Kingslayer, and gave us a whole new perspective on him.  <br /> <br />I'm not running out to grab this new one in hardcover, because the same people that turned me on to this series are telling me that the new episode is kind of weak. And honestly, it's hard to imagine progressing this story without the presence of Tyrion, Dragon Gal and Jon Snow. I think I'll wait for the 5th volume to come out, buy it with this one and read them in sync. <br /> <br />
B0007RT9LM|5.0|Entertaining comedy with Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia. The bashful Violet comes from the province to the turbulent New York, in order to realize, despite her terrible stage fright, her dream of a song writer. She finds support in the charming Kevin. She works in Coyote Ugly\\", the most hip club in town. After lots of obstacles she faces her first performance.
B000AOEN2C|1.0|first of all, let me explain something.(to you who are NOT finding the 1 * review helpful at the bottom of this page)  If you watched the original series closely(or at all for that matter) you'd find that thier is an insecurity aboard the enterprise(as in Kirk, McCOy and crew ect.)  This is \\"New Fronteir\\" as stated by Kirk himself.  Enterprise(as in the seires Archer) is a lackluster attempt for nostalgia without even knowing what the true concept is about!  The crew is too comfortable, and worried more about how \\"irritating\\" the smell of human is to vulcan females, rather than how dangerous space travel can be.  Thier is no sense of anxiety as in the kirk series.  It does not feel as it took place before; but after.  I am infiriated to the point of rage by one season in particular as it reflects 9/11 in a macho attempt to appease our war-hungery audiance.  T'Pau(or whatever you spell it) is much of the time out of character for a vulcan.  More than the music, most of these characters are sappy(particuallarly the male characters) and unfriendly.  They have no respect for one another, and are not inspiring at all.  I don't feel I could care weather they lived or died.  I always routed for Spock, McCoy and Kirk(and crew) but not with the Archer Club.(as in Culture Club).  After Next Generation the writers got soft from being in the tank too long and laid in thier money bins not worried about \\"New Frontiers\\".  If you rate this anything other than one star, you odviously are too young to know better.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|I actually had reasonably high hopes for this film.  It stars Jennifer Connely and John C. Reilly, two actors whose movie choices I generally trust.  In addition, I have an affinity for good horror flicks, and the trailers for this movie led me to believe \\"Dark Water\\" would be a creepy, psychological thriller.   <br /> <br />To some extent, the movie works:  the visuals are very dreary, and that stain on the ceiling, as cheesy as it may sound, really does take on a supporting role.  However, the movie fails to deliver any real scares and never does anything more than to build up only the slightest amount of tension.  Jennifer Connely does as good of a job as she can do given the material, and John Reilly does a passable job as the building's owner (although part of me feels he was miscast).   <br /> <br />Horror films sometimes have a bad habit of bringing a film to a nonsensical crescendo, and \\"Dark Water\\" is no different.  The movie fails to tie the plot together into something that makes any kind of sense, although this would have been more forgivable if the movie had been decently scary throughout.  For people who reaaaaaaaally are still curious to see this movie, I would recommend renting the movie and splitting the cost with a group of four or more friends so you don't end up feeling like you wasted much more than 75 cents and two hours of your life.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|With my husband making constant references to Gene Wilder, I missed seeing this in a darkened theater - too bad!  I wasn't prepared to laugh so much at the delightfully playful wit and dark humor.  Loved the melting dolls!  My impression of Willie Wonka's character on first seeing and listening to him was also of Michael Jackson, but that immediately vanished.  I loved all of the director's choices so far as actors were concerned, the costumes and sets were exceptional.  Within five minutes, I loved this movie!  It's light years removed from \\"Willie Wonka\\", in the best way possible.  To compare the two is like comparing apples to oranges, but this is the film I'll watch again and again.
B0007OCG56|4.0|Of course it is not a masterpiece, but if you have a good sense of humor and same knowledge and understanding regarding other cultures, you will enjoy it as I did. (If you do not have this atributes, probably you do not qualify to watch this movie) I like a lot Sandler's movies.  Anger Managment, Happy Wilmore, Puch-Drunk Love (different but still ok.)     Spanglish is not the exception.
0060763280|5.0|This book really opened up my eyes to my limiting beliefs.  I read this a year after reading \\"Creating Money\\" by Sanaya Roman and Duane Packer... both are great reads but this really made me see how certain attitudes I had were not going to help me get rich.  I think everyone can benefit from this book.  Note- he does plug his seminars a lot but he explains why and also offers free tickets to the seminar, so it isn't like it would cost you anything to go!  He makes a good point about all the people who say they \\"just want to be comfortable\\"- that's all you will ever be; you will you never get rich with that mindset.  That really hit home with me!
B00005YXZH|5.0|A brilliant album. Truly a breakthough in modern rock music. YHF combines beautiful melodies with unique arrangements while maintaing the basic rock feel. Wilco is the best band working today. Combine this with \\"A Ghost is Born\\" and you have two of the best records of the last ten years, hands down.<br /><br />However, this LP has to grow on you. Like many other Wilco efforts, I had to listen to it a few times to \\"get it\\". I am sure you will have to as well.<br /><br />Get this record, you will not be disappointed.
0740748475|5.0|I have been building a good book collection over the years and this set, as well as the Far Side collection, will definately be great additions.
0671027344|1.0|I hate to be so forward when reviewing things, but I have to say that this book is pretty much terrible. I was recommended this book by a friend who \\"absolutely loved it\\" and \\"had a touching emotional experience.\\" The only thing touching here was this book and the trash can.<br /><br />The book's concept is an overall interesting take on growing up through the eyes of a \\"wallflower.\\" The presentation of the book is pretty much fine and the added typographical errors made the protagonist seem his age (although I hope they were intended errors). However, from there, everything just goes downhill.<br /><br />After about thirty pages, I definitely was questioning his integrity. A fifteen year old kid had no idea about masturbation? Let me guess, the kid has never picked up a magazine, book, or even turned on the TV? Further, he's never gone through the sex ed classes (which in 1991 were basically mandatory and more aggressive than the sex ed classes of today). This loss of integrity continues when the first mention of a homosexual relationship is started; the kid is clearly a Christian and has a hard time even saying curse words -- yet he's A-OK with non-heterosexual relationships? The kid doesn't even comment on it or explain it, as he does with trivial things like the English teacher.<br /><br />I guess I'm being a little critical here, but the book totally lost my interest early on. Without a protagonist that seems real, the whole story just falls apart. I even question the realism of the other minor characters in the book. A guy in the park, the toasting teens who drink to the protagonist's name, and so on. I really hope that this isn't based on real events because the author has failed miserably.<br /><br />What's so great about this book? Well, I suppose it shows all walks of life and the struggles of growing up. I personally really enjoy this sort of book because it usually deals with isolation and complexity of daily situations to people at certain ages. But what is this book? Everything has been pushed to some extreme: the kid is so naive that he appears to have a slight case of mental retardation or he was in a coma for nine years of his life. It's trying too hard to be emotional and it feels like an episode of MTV's \\"The Real World\\". (That is ironic because apparently MTV had something to do with the publishing of the book. Maybe this is less ironic and more predictable, in fact).<br /><br />I wholeheartedly suggest another book, no matter who you are. There are so many better books out there that give the reader insight into this interesting sort of subject.. But what is this book?

B000BP86OG|4.0|For years my ears have had to put up with boy bands, pop idols and Britney spears.<br /><br />Finally an album that brings back kick ass rock n roll.<br /><br />The ballads are huge, the riffs rock, the singing is put on your leather pants over the top, awesome singing.<br /><br />I read some reviews of this album, nearly every one saying how much this album rocked. I bought it and those reviews are right.<br /><br />If you long for the days where Motley Crue and Guns n roses ruled the music jungle then gives this album a listen.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a king among nerds, a slack-jawed, mouth-breathing high school student who suffers the slings and arrows of perpetual ridicule, yet who gives as good as he gets when the treatment gets too rough.  Luckily, Napoleon is far from alone in his nerddom. He has an older brother who wears buttoned-up short sleeve dress shirts and black-rimmed glasses, and whose social contact is limited mainly to people he meets in internet chat rooms.  Napoleon's Uncle Rick is what might be called a \\"muscular nerd,\\" a used-up, middle aged football player who dreams of his glory days in 1982 when he was just one play away from a career in the NFL and a life of fame and fortune, and who now spends his time hawking Tupperware products, selling miracle breast enhancement devices, and investing in time travel machines he finds in catalogues.  Napoleon also befriends the school's newest nerd, a transfer student named Pedro, and tries to start up a romance with the shy and awkward Deb, who sheepishly goes door to door drumming up business for her studio that specializes in \\"glamour\\" photo shots for a decidedly unglamorous clientele.<br /><br />Set in a small town in rural Idaho, \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is a quirky regional comedy that achieved phenomenal mainstream success at the American box office.  Its appeal is in its low-keyed, understated look at a group of people that more of us probably identify with than we would like to acknowledge.  This is a movie for anyone who has ever felt unattractive or unpopular, who just never quite \\"fit in\\" with the people who really counted, especially in those dark ages known as the \\"teen years.\\"  One can't help liking and rooting for these bizarre and eccentric individuals who are really just looking for the same love and acceptance that we all are.<br /><br /> Director Jared Hess, along with co-writer Jerusha Hess, never feels the need to exaggerate or overstate the comedy.  It would have been easy for them to have turned this into another \\"Revenge of the Nerds,\\" placing their characters in over-the-top predicaments and situations to appease audience expectations.  Instead, they let the story develop subtly and gradually, making the film feel more attuned to real life in the process.  It may seem like a contradiction in terms, but the writers achieve their humor through a kind of understated hyperbole that allows us to laugh with the characters rather than at them.  These nerds may be nerds to the core, but they reflect the longings and doubts common to all of us at one time or another.  As a result, \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is warm and humanistic where it could easily have been cruel and condescending.<br /><br />The filmmakers are helped immeasurably by a wonderfully talented cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly.  Joe Heder as Napoleon, Aaron Ruell as his brother, Kip, Efren Ramirez as Pedro, and Tina Majorino as Deb all deliver their lines in a flat, emotionless, singsong monotone that perfectly captures the defense mechanism each of them has set up as a shield against a brutal, uncomprehending world.  Yet, Napoleon and his fellow nerds never settle for victim status, as each finds a way to assert his individuality and carve out a little piece of happiness for himself.  As an actor, only Jon Gries as Napoleon's Uncle Rico gets to break through the somnambulist haze and go for the fences in his delivery.<br /><br />\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is clearly not the kind of movie that every audience will appreciate, but those movie watchers with a taste for the offbeat and quirky will have a fun time with it.rned this into another \\"Revenge of the Nerds,\\" placing their characters in over-the-top predicaments and situations to appease audience expectations.

B00005JN0T|1.0|In iRobot, Will Smith reprises his role as the Fresh Prince of Bel Air; only this time, the Fresh Prince is in the future! The movie starts out with the government hiring Will to teach the increasingly disgruntled unemployed worker robots how to rap and breakdance. It works and Will soon enrolls his electronic proteges in a rap and breakdance competition where they have to face off against Boogaloo Shrimp and his evil robot pal 23465477. Will's robots win and they sign a deal with Arista. The end. This movie sucks.
B0007OCG56|4.0|I must admit that it took a little while for \\"Spanglish\\" to completely win me over - but win me over it did thanks to its sharply observed social commentary and winning performances by a first-rate cast.  At first, the film threatens to be swept away by a tidal wave of stereotypical characters and cliches, but it doesn't take long for the subtleties and complexities to kick in and to lift the movie to a higher level.<br /><br />This is James L. Brooks' witty take on the cultural divide that separates the \\"master class\\" from the \\"servant class\\" in multi-ethnic Los Angeles.  The Hispanic side of the equation is represented by Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a gorgeous single mother living in Mexico who heads to America to start a new life for herself and her daughter.  Eventually, despite the fact that she cannot speak English, Flor finds a job as a fulltime housekeeper and nanny for a wealthy white family named the Claskys.  The wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni), is a deeply neurotic limousine liberal who drives her family crazy with her obsessive compulsiveness and lack of a clear mental focus.  Her husband, John, is a mild-mannered master chef who has become completely exasperated by the intensely mercurial nature of his wife's behavior and moods, and who yearns for nothing more than a little peace and harmony on the home front.  The Claskys also have a sweet-tempered but homely daughter, Bernice, who bonds with Flor's beautiful daughter, Christina, who narrates the tale.<br /><br />What distinguishes \\"Spanglish\\" from so many other American comedies is its staunch refusal to adhere to a cookie-cutter formula.  Brooks has written a screenplay that allows the characters room to breathe and to interact with one another in complex and surprising ways.  He doesn't even feel the need to tie up all the loose ends in the closing minutes.  He is perfectly willing to let the characters continue to live their lives even after the closing credits have scrolled by.  What he captures best is the subtle tug-of-war that develops between the two mothers over their respective daughters, particularly Deborah's intense devotion to Christina, which seems partly a result of a genuine desire to help her get ahead in life, and partly an unconscious preference for this beautiful child over her own overweight daughter.  Brooks understands the sore spots inherent in parent/child interactions as well as relationships in general.  Naturally, a romantic attraction eventually develops between John and Flor, but one that is handled with charm, delicacy and tact.<br /><br />Sandler and Vega give warmth, touching performances, and Shelbie Bruce, Sarah Steele and Cloris Leachman offer superb support.  Leoni starts off so over-the-top that one fears she will throw the entire movie off-kilter.  But damned if she doesn't grow on you, as she turns what could have been a psychological gargoyle into a sympathetic woman filled with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.<br /><br />Happily, the humor in the film arises naturally from the characters and situations and almost never feels desperate or forced.  And, indeed, there are some very hearty laughs generously laced throughout the movie.<br /><br />\\"Spanglish' doesn't try to \\"solve\\" the ethnic and race relations problems that still plague America's largest cities.  However, in its own quiet, humor-filled way, it reminds us that the caste system is still very much a reality in a country that prides itself on its supposed lack of class-consciousness.-of-war that develops between the two mothers over their respective daughters, particularly Deborah's intense devotion to Christina, which seems partly a result of a genuine desire to help her get ahead in life, and partly an unconscious preference for this beautiful child over her own overweight daughter.

Its more than THE WAR,its the people as well as the feeling of the times. What a gift of prose he has. This book made me come to respect Michael Herr as the most articulate writer i have ever come across.    <br />
B000669GAI|5.0|Ignore the idiot below, the fact that he thinks Tool are a grunge band shows that he clearly knows nothing about music.
B00004TWZF|4.0|Issues of format aside, people either love this movie or hate it, depending it seems on familiarity and acceptance of the metephore on which this movie is based.  The US is rooted in English culture, a society with a singular relationship with the ocean:  dark, violent, and cold - a sea so dangerous, they dug a tunnel under it.  Most of the rest of western Europe, and all those shown in this movie, are connected to the Mediteranian.  This creates an all together different relationship with the sea, a bright, warm, and calm place where the ocean is mother, giver of life, and the depths of the sea are the womb of the Earth.  Understand and accept this relationship, and the movie makes sense - a cascade of elegant gestures.  Do not and the story is but a series of weak and unrelated sub plots.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Michael Buble's \\"Caught in the Act\\" is shear viewing pleasure!!  Michael is a phenomenal vocalist and an exquisite entertainer.  He can make an old standard sound brand new.  His voice is beautiful, sexy and mellow!  His sense of humor is enjoyable! His little banter with Josh Groban is hillarious! His duet with Chris Botti is fabulous! What a great concert!!
B000ARTMU2|4.0|The sound was very good and the picture was great. Alot of action in this flick. I am not a real fan of Stalone but Rambo is a character to watch. Very good buy.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|This is a great CD, great Band.  BUT, the content protection that is a part of it won't let you copy the music to your hard drive or put it on an iPod.  This may not matter to you, so don't bother reading on.  However, if this does matter to you then don't buy the CD.  The fact that I cannot put the music that I purchased onto my iPod is extremely annoying.  I do not appreciate this feature in any way.  So, five stars to the band, no stars to this CD.  From now on, if I see \\"Content Protected\\" I'm gonna steer clear.  I feel stupid having wasted money on one of these, but oh well, live and learn.  If you care about this, learn from me.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Very intelligently made, this movie takes the viewer through a reflection process in a very pleasant and funny manner. Bill Murray is a very egocentric and unhappy weather man that goes through a transformation process in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania where he is covering the Grounghog Day celebration for the 4th time in a row. Initially, he is a very frustrated, selfish, sarcastic person that transmits his negativeness to everyone that is around him. He finds himself awaking everyday in the same town and the same day - every day is Grounghog Day and only he knows. The first couple of times he &#34;reincarnates&#34;, he's kind of scared about it. The next few times, he tries to take advantage of the situation, such as manipulating people to get what he wants. After awaking again, and again in the same place, same day, he starts to feel empty and depressed. He then touches bottom and kills himself several times trying unsuccessfully to end his suffering &#34;reincarnation cycle&#34;. After realizing that there's nothing he can do to stop it, he then gets closer to his feelings and starts an attitude changing process. He becomes less egocentric in every cycle. He becomes closer to his colleagues, and the community, and starts to give more instead of receiving. He becomes truly concerned about the rest of the people more than in himself. He realizes that this new attitude makes him happier. The less selfish he becomes, the happier he gets. This is the key to stop his suffering reincarnation cycle: unselfish love.
B00005QCVY|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made. Supurb cast, well acted. Shows how our lives are interwoven with one another, and what we do, DOES make a difference not only in our own life, but in everyone's life!!! Of course we all know the story, In the picturesque town of Bedford Falls, an angel trying to earn his wings shows George Bailey what happens if he had never been born. It also shows that people with all the material things in life aren't necessarily the happy ones (Mr. Potter), and although George Bailey didn't live in the best house, his kids weren't the best dressed, but he was the one that was actually \\"the richest man in town\\"
B0009WFFS6|1.0|What a disappointment! I am a huge Eric Clapton fan but this is perhaps the most boring DVD I ever watched. Three old guys remembering the good old times, barely awake. With a few exceptions, they are completely detached from the music and each other.
0060899190|5.0|I love this book!  I received it as a gift and it's very interesting.  Some of the secrets are kinda weird...but I guess that's what makes it interesting.  I would recommend it to anyone!  :)  I also love how part of the proceeds of this book go to a suicidal hotline.
B000002KDO|5.0|This is my favorite Sabbath album and also the heaviest of the Ozzy period (also my favorite period of Sabbath) every song on this album is good from the beginning of \\"Sweet Leaf\\" to the end of \\"Into the Void\\" no metalhead should live without this metal classic.
B000ASSDVA|4.0|Many people know nothing about the history of Spain or its culture and heritage.  From this viewpoint the movie very richly describes a Spanish legend that is truly inspirational. <br /> <br />Granted, the beautiful music by Miklos Rozsa, and the scenery, and several scenes, are warmed-over \\"Ben Hur\\". Try to get around the \\"letcha\\" (\\"let you\\"} and \\"gotcha\\" (\\"got you\\") lazy language. This is \\"Ben Hur\\" a thousand years later and set in Spain.  But the message remains a good one: peace (remember, Charleton Heston and the NRA) but not at the cost of integrity.  El Cid's deathbed request that he would be on his horse at the head of the army, is truly the stuff legends are made of. <br /> <br />In summary, enjoy the historical and inspirational facets of the movie and let the rest just flow over your shoulders.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|This movie takes on a storyline never done before. Underworld is an excellent movie and i recommend it to any fans of the vampire/werewolf genre.  Kate Beckinsale plays selene perfectly.  The other cast members of the story play their parts very well and make this movie a very good movie.  I highly recommend this movie because it has a great story line.  I cant wait till the next one comes out it should be a great movie just as good as the first if not better.
B000BVEKO0|2.0|Let me start off by saying this isn't a bad album. It doesn't blend in with the \\"nu-metal heap\\" or anything, it is worth listening to, but if you're an old school Korn fan who was far less than content with Issues and/or Untouchables stay away. There are two major problems with this cd that I can pinpoint exactly: 1)only one guitarist...there's nothing wrong with munky, but there's only one of him, 2)NO SLAP BASS!!! I miss fieldy's slap bass...hearing the smack of every note as he pounded it out was incredible, and it's gone. To me, that sound coupled with Jon's voice was Korn's identity. On a larger scale, the whole album just doesn't sound as great as it could have. Have of the stuff is too melodic nu-metalish, and the other half is too Nine Inch Nailsish. I was hoping Korn would be able to continue with the lose of Brian, and though they are, their change in sound will not appeal to old school fans, but it will most definetly bring in a new generation of fans.
B00005JOFO|4.0|Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two down-on-their-luck cowpokes looking for a summer job as they silently meet outside a dusty ranch trailer in 1963 Wyoming. Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid), ranch boss, gives them the duty of moving a herd of sheep up to a spot called Brokeback Mountain where they'll wile away the hours protecting the flock from predators and allowing them to graze. Their lives are pretty boring and tough, each having to cook, keep an eye on the sheep, and suffer their daily routines. Until one night ...<br /><br />Ennis comes down from the mountain and is too drunk to go back up, so falls asleep outside Jack's tent. Ennis' shivering awakens Jack and he tells Ennis to get inside the tent before he freezes. It is here that something extraordinary and frightening happens: they have sex. It isn't the soft, touchy-feely kind either. It's rough and earnest, as though they had hidden something deep down inside each of them that finally was allowed out for some air. But their activities don't go unnoticed ...<br /><br />Their boss, Joe Aguirre, catches sight of the two of them \\"wrestling\\" and decides to pull them off the mountain. Their summer is cut short and as they part ways, Ennis and Jack are awkward and hesitant. Jack drives away and Ennis walks down the street, watching Jack's truck vanish down the road. And as this happens, Ennis suddenly become overwhelmed and crumples to the ground, acting as if a part of him has been ripped out.<br /><br />Jack and Ennis won't meet up for another four years, during which time they both become married, have children, and develop a semblance of societal normalcy. But when they do finally meet up, they run into each others arms and are immediately back on Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />But can their relationship survive in a time when \\"alternate lifestyles\\" were taboo? Can Ennis give as much as Jack wants (Jack continually asks Ennis to move with him to a quiet cabin spot and help with a herd of their own, but Ennis can't break away from what his family and society expects of him)?<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Ang Lee (HULK, 2003) delivers his best film to date.

The pacing was very slow, like the lives of these two men, so if you're expecting a bang-bang (no pun intended) action, don't get your hopes up. But if you don't mind a very leisurely pace (I'd say it's about on par with the film SIDEWAYS, so if you didn't like that film's pace, stay away from this one), you'll probably love it to pieces.<br /><br />The \\"love\\" should've been ratcheted up a notch. The scenes took on a sense of paramours meeting rather than two people truly in love.<br /><br />But the upside of the movie can't be denied. It touches on relationships in a way that most films can't get close to, and does so in a dramatic and thought-provoking way. And ogling at the stunning mountain backdrops added that extra bit of flavor, too.lp with a herd of their own, but Ennis can't break away from what his family and society expects of him)?  <br />______________________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br />Ang Lee (HULK, 2003) delivers his best film to date.

B000AWYOG4|3.0|Raphael Yglesias, the man who wrote THE RING, must have a thing for water and dead girls.  This theme from THE RING is given a new life in DARK WATER.  While the movie is certainly spooky at times, I felt like I was watching THE RING all over again.  It's not hard to predict where the story is going, and this lack of suspense makes the movie seem a little lengthy and protracted.  Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly gives a top notch performance as Dahlia, a young single mother who moves with her daughter into a low-rent apartment on Roosevelt Island.  Facing nasty custody charges from her ex-husband, Connelly takes the apartment to start her life anew.  But things go awry when the apartment starts sprouting leaks all over the place.  Water is everywhere in this movie, from the relentless rain outside to the faucets, commodes, sinks, washers, etc.  The psychological occurrences are deeply rooted in Connelly's own past, and as the movie unfolds, we know there is something definitely going on in the dwelling.<br /><br />All this is effectively chilling, but since its predictable, one doesn't get totally involved.<br /><br />Ariel Gade is marvelous as young Cecily; Tim Roth, Dougray Scott, and Pete Postelthwaite are equally effective.  Only John C. Reilly in a basically utilitarian role is wasted as the apartment's manager.  The musical score by Angelo Badalmenti (the man who did the wonderful TWIN PEAKS music) is quite good.  If you haven't seen THE RING, you may enjoy DARK WATER; however, isn't it time to leave the possessive child demon behind?

0790729393|5.0|SLEEPERS is a difficult movie to watch, but one cannot deny its impact.  Allegedly based on a true story, Lorenzo Carcaterra's tale was finally discredited and found to be bogus.  While this lessens the impact somewhat, director Barry Levinson has assembled a brilliant cast and the story catches you from the start and never lets up.  A tragic accident that springs from a boyish prank lands four boys in a detention home where they are brutalized by four of the guards.  The movie shifts to 1983, where the boys are now young men.  Two of them have turned to a life of violent crime, one is a minion at a newspaper office and the other is now a district attorney.  When a chance for revenge (a strong theme in the movie) occurs, the story becomes a combination of courtroom drama and behind the scenes corruption.  You'll find yourself questioning the actions of some of the characters and how they achieve \\"justice,\\" but you can't deny its forceful conclusion.  The cast is marvelous:  the young boys (particularly Joseph Perrino and Brad Renfro) are superb, in difficult roles; Robert DeNiro is wonderful as the boys' priest friend; Dustin Hoffman in a smaller role is great as the alcoholic lawyer who defends the boys; Vittorio Gassman is very effective as the gentle mob lawyer who pulls his strings; Minnie Driver shines as the boys' childhood friend all grown up and who loves them all; Kevin Bacon is absolutely astonishingly chilling as the head guard; Terry Kinney gives a solid performance as the other head guard; and of course, the adult boys are brilliant:  Jason Patric as laidback Shakes; Brad Pitt as the attorney; and Ron Eldard and Billy Crudup as the accused murderers.  SLEEPERS is a disturbing yet powerful film that will haunt you after it is over.
B0001HAISG|5.0|To present, I've seen ten different versions of Peter Pan, from live stage productions to animated films, TV series to TV specials.  Quite simply, this one is the best. <br /> <br />The faults are tiny and easy to overlook, and the good aspects too numerous to go into.  The cast is quite simply astoundingly good.  Each of the \\"main\\" characters (Peter Pan, Wendy Darling, Capt. Hook/Mr. Darling, Smee & Tinkerbell) are better than any others I've seen, and I've seen some fine performances in each role.  The visual effects enhance and don't overshadow the story and acting.  The supporting cast is equally well-chosen, with stand-out jobs by the young actor & actress playing Slightly and Princess Tiger-Lily.  When all the elements mesh so well, that means good directing, and PJ Hogan deserves a big round of applause for that. <br /> <br />As for the DVD itself, there are a lot of nice extras thrown in which give you both some technical glimpses and a look at the players and how they behave towards each other off-camera. <br /> <br />After seeing so many ho-hum attempts at the story (I include the Disney animated among them), it's so nice to see someone really do it right.  Barrie would have approved.

0345363132|5.0|If you're a fan of historical fiction, and value honesty to the facts as well as spellbinding storytelling, then this is your book. Flawlessly researched and written. When the book is done it'll take you a day or two to pull out of the languid feeling of having lived in another time. Seamless point of view changes. A stunning read that will be one book you'll want to keep and read again.
0312263120|3.0|Entertaining ride, but the events in this book require a complete suspension of any knowledge you might have of computers, viruses, encryption, etc. If you don't know anything about those fields, and you like his other books, you'll like this one, too - but treat it as fiction. If you do know anything about those fields, check your knowledge at the door.
B000BW7QX6|1.0|Anybody want a used copy of this bummer?  I have it listed here for $13, and only played once.  Very boring.  Lame, and hard to follow.  Anybody who rates this as an excellent movie-----Well lets just say it doesn't take much to amuse them.  I love a good sci fi, action/adventure.  Although the special effects were great, it isn't enough to make me want to watch this movie more than once. If you want real good sci fi watch the Star Wars Saga's.
0156027321|2.0|A coworker of mine loaned me this book because we talk books a lot and make recommendations to each other and she LOVED it.  I read the back and was pretty skeptical, but I dove into it yesterday and shouldered through the whole 319 odd pages.  I am a very fast reader, but this was a horribly slow read for me (2 days when I had little to do).  I found it very difficult to get engaged in the story until after the boat sinks... and although I found it mildly interesting after that, I'm not fond of stories about people getting stranded on desert islands or on boats in the middle of the ocean, and I especially hate hearing of all the disgusting things they have to eat to survive.  I have to agree with another reviewer in that I would probably last about 2 days stuck in the middle of the ocean on a boat... animals or no animals. <br /> <br />Anyway, although my personal feelings against the subject matter may have prevented me from liking the book as a whole, I could have been very drawn in and fascinated by the right book or the right story.  I'm not sure exactly what I disliked about the book, but there was something about the writing style that simply failed to capture my attention.  Everyone is talking about the \\"message\\" they gleaned from the book but I didn't come away from it with any new groundbreaking ideas about God or religion or anything else... although I was a Religious Studies major, so maybe I already know it all, just like Pi. ;) <br /> <br />In sum, I really don't think this book is for everyone as some other reviewers claim.  I don't particularly think it's a children's book, and I certainly don't think it has the widespread appeal of Harry Potter, which has been referenced in other reviews as a comparison that escapes me completely.  Perhaps for me it was a combination of the subject matter, the male point of view, and the unsatisfying ending (in my view) that all contributed to my dislike of the book.  However, I read like a crazy person and I very rarely come across a book that I do not read more than once or 4287591 times.  This is a book I simply would not pick up again.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Overall not as good as the second one major area to blame is the plot way too dissapoint of Neo Perfomance at this one, is like watching a david beated by goliah. however a must watch for special effect alike fan, this one due to had great scene, such as the robot ! very cool and the final fight,  not enought melee fight or beside the final fight special effect dominate this one but little hand to hand combat.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|i cannot say how disappointing this movie was, after loving the TV series so much.  the movie lost everything that was good about the series:  relationships, values, wit, and quirkiness that comes along with people just trying to make it the best way they can.  serenity pandered to 10 year old boys who want kick boxing and space ships shooting at each other.  i was bored out of my mind.  now, don't get me wrong:  i love a good fight in any format, when there is some motivation behind it that is worthwhile.  i wanted so much to love this and cannot express fully my disappointment... sorry, joss, but this, in my opinion, is the stake in the heart of one of my favorite scifi TV series ever.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Even after nearly 2 year after release some of the effect still shock me such as the freewat chase, multple smight fight with neo, and alot more, if u haven;t watch yet then i might missed something beyong belife in your eye.
0393327655|4.0|The author admits that the end of faith is nowhere near, specifically religious faith. But it is not that he would not like to see that occur. Religion is the anachronism of our age that for the most part is dominated by rational thinking. Most of the main tenets of religion are at best nonsense. But it is the major point of the author that religion is hardly a benign force in the world.<br /><br />Religion is the only body of belief that encourages non-believers or those who violate religious tenets to be found and punished, if not killed. It is most uncomfortable in our world of imagined tolerance to understand that for hundreds of years the Christian church tortured and executed tremendous numbers of people as heretics, witches, skeptics, etc - all over a philosophy of most dubious merit. But the author is most concerned with modern day Islam. He counters the claim that Islam is basically a religion of peace by turning to the Koran. The Koran is simply riddled with instructions to the faithful to destroy infidels; furthermore, paradise immediately awaits those who do so. The Middle-eastern terrorist movement is largely an Islamic reaction to the infidels of the West.<br /><br />It is the fundamentalists of the various religions that take religious dogma literally and then act on those notions often with all sorts of repercussions to \\"others.\\" The author is concerned about the tolerance shown by religious moderates towards fundamentalists. It seems that a protective veil exists around religions as far as criticism goes. Yet not all religions are equal in their service to mankind. Islam is dominated by fundamentalists - it is risky to be a moderate. The author forecasts that if left unchecked - not condemned by other religions and moderates - Islam may be on a relentless course to destroy the world as we know it.<br /><br />How about the spiritual aspects of religion? The author consistently maintains that the spiritual nature of life is best contemplated through reasoning, based on worldly evidence. Religion because it suppresses discussion of its core tenets can never be the means to the more profound insights of our lives. It is not the intent of the author to construct some sort of elaborate system of thought to replace religion.<br /><br />The author points out that religion does have tremendous sway in the U.S., supposedly a country of immense rational thinking. For example, a person could not run for President as an atheist, regardless of qualifications. The author does not discuss a long-held view that religion is the opiate of the people. In other words, those who wish to control society are only too happy see a substantial percentage of the population be diverted by nonsense, ignoring the reality of their lives that could be ameliorated politically. But that is another book.<br /><br />What is probably most interesting for most readers is the violent nature of Islam - it is in black and white. The author pretty much endorses preemptive war against the most active Islamic elements. The author would like to \\"out\\" Islam in all of its rhetoric to destroy, but that hardly seems politically feasible in the world community. It is unlikely that the book will change many minds. Those who find religion to be nonsense, if not harmful, will be confirmed in their belief; those who are religious will more than likely find the book to be blasphemous. Of course, the author would hope that the religious, especially the moderates, might see that religion is totally out of step with what mankind has learned over the last two thousand years. There may be someone out there.through reasoning, based on worldly evidence.

B00000K19E|4.0|No doubt alot modern film copy matrix famous for bullet proof shoot at his 180 or 360 degreea like shot no doubt this make the movie famous for it self and top of that is the plot something very intersting.  However still won;t satifst my 5 star cause it do bad acting in this one, a boring start, and is like alot of highs and lows in this one.. Not good organize but is still a charm in this one.
B0009R1T7M|2.0|It just goes to show you the sad state of the music industry when anything that comes along showing the slightest bit of ambition or originality, is instantly praised as a masterpiece and given Best of the Year honors.  I am the victim of the hype and countless glowing reviews that this album generated. <br /> <br />I enjoyed his album on Michigan.  I was hoping the reviews I've read about Illinois were correct, but I lost that bet.  This album is annoying and very pretentious.  Each of the 22 tracks has something in it that I don't like.  Whether it's stupid instrumention, lame lyrics that don't make any sense, background vocal choirs that do not fit the songs, etc.  I can't find one song I can totally get behind, which was not the case with Michigan. <br /> <br />I heard the song \\"Chicago\\" was good.. but what does it mean?  He sounds like he's trying to be artsy and vauge and therefore we are stuck with lyrics that can't possibly tell a story.  He also mentions crying in about every song, which is a real downer.  I got this on the hype, hoping for something like Michigan, but instead we got the most overrated album (the album you want to try hard to love so people will think you're cool) of the year.
B000065U1N|2.0|I watched this a few days after watching the 2 hour documentary on the History channel, and it didn't compare at all to the real story. Want to really have your eyes opened? Watch the documetary. I loved it, and I hate documentaries!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is just incredible all the songs are really good!!U will enjoy this album trust me!!it's my favorite cd to dated wow im still impressed about Madonna!
B0002858YS|1.0|Well, I hate to be the one to break the news to you, but The Killers are absolutely horrible! With monotonous music that I can play on a melody pop, they added such lyrics as:<br /><br />\\"Well somebody told me<br /><br />You had a boyfriend<br /><br />Who looks like a girlfriend<br /><br />That I had in February of last year<br /><br />It's not confidential<br /><br />I've got potential\\" (Somebody Told Me lyrics)<br /><br />\\"Please believe me, Natalie<br /><br />Listen Natalie<br /><br />This is your last chance to find<br /><br />A go-go dance to disco now\\" (Believe Me Natalie lyrics)<br /><br />\\"But, Alec, I like them so much! How can you say this?\\" They play music that is poppy and catchy, so it is no surprise that they are loved by many people. Just because you got to listen to The Killers before someone in the boonies doesn't make the band or their music any better. Time is no factor when it's about good music. And just to prove my point, we'll see where they are in a year. Also, how about, oh, I dunno, SINGING a song, and not saying the words... \\"Now, he takes off her dress ... now.\\" (Mr. Brightside lyrics). I'm sorry people, but The Killers are no good. Thank mainstream for making them popular, because they don't have the talent to do it themselves.
B0006IJ5PM|5.0|\\"Friday Night Lights\\" tells of the 1988 Odessa, Texas high school football team.  In Texas, football is king, and the hopes and dreams of entire towns can ride on their team.  Odessa won state championships before, but this team is perhaps a bit smaller than usual, and the coach is new and untested.  Fortunately, they have Boobie Miles, a star player who could possibly carry them to the state championship.  The movie follows these players over the season, as the town alternates between rallying around them and vilifying them.<br /><br />Based on the non-fiction book by Buzz Bissinger, \\"Friday Night Lights\\" doesn't rely on the \\"big game\\" ending typical of sports movies.  The movie focuses on football, but it relies more on the characters.  It's about a town that is economically depressed and needs something behind which to rally.  \\"Friday Night Lights\\" could be just another Cinderella sports story.  However, it's not about winning - it's about the pressure the town puts on the team and the coach.  Fortunately, the acting is superb, especially Lucas Black (\\"Sling Blade\\") as the glowering quarterback and Derek Luke (\\"Antwone Fisher\\") as the star, Boobie.  You feel for these boys; you want them to win; but most of all, you want them to have some kind of life after the season draws to a close.  That's what \\"Friday Night Lights\\" is all about, and it's a really terrific movie.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Somewhere between sheer fear and repulsive gore lies this movie racing against few others for the best horror film of 2004. If for some reason you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and watch it.<br /><br />The premise is simple: Two men wake up to find themselves chained to metal pipes on oposite sides of a ridiculously large and open bathroom. They're the next \\"murder\\" cases for the Jigsaw killer. I'll keep this spoiler proof, and not go any further as to the guidelines they must obey in order to escape.<br /><br />The camera work in this movie is not complex, but it's exactly what was needed to convey the scenes.<br /><br />The ending twist is beautiful! Even if someone has been a jerk and ruined the ending for you, watch it anyway.
0679422714|3.0|...for people who know nothing about Mao.  But then go and read some other stuff (Schram, Spence, and Snow).  This is written by a woman who experienced life as a wealthy child in the early years of the PRC, who fervently believed in Mao's dreams for China, and whose hopes were ultimately disappointed by his brutality.  Chang was herself carried along in the chaotic violence of the Cultural Revolution.  Her task here is to put Mao in the same historical category as Hitler and Stalin.  If you believe this is a useful way to think about history, you'll like the book.  If you think the world is more complex than a Grimm brothers fairy tale, with evil dragons and noble knights, you might still learn some important things from this book, but then also benefit from further reading.  Chang is less responsible than an average journalist or a historian in the way she extracts contradictory sources and chooses ones that fit her agenda.  Still, Mao's brutality is indefensible, so she puts her critics in a very tricky spot.  Her methods are poor, and ultimately may be problematic for her cause, leading to negative reactions to her work that potentially have more sound empirical grounding (like Iris Chang's \\"Rape of Nanking\\").  Ultimately the book is an easily digestible read with a clear goal, but it could do more harm than good in its essentialization of a complex figure.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|KONG improves with new watchings and that does NOT slow the impact or the emotion! I watched twice last December! It's a real cinematic wonder! Indeed!    I have read an interview (published on NY Times I guess) on kongisking.net with a primatologist which works for the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International who said that Kong is authentic not only by its moves or the way he picked up objects but \\"Kong's protective nature - Gorillas will defend members of their family to the death\\" and - as said by the primatologist - \\"Kong laughed in the movie - Gorillas do laugh\\"    This movie brings us what we seek in the movies - at least what I seek in movies - action, drama, romance, emotion! I think Kong is TRULY AMAZING!!!    I really enjoyed the all-action sequences in Skull Island because it developes the drama and the danger of this menacing Island! And it's pure cinema and pure entertaining!    That said - this is one of my 2005 favorite movies!  Thanks - AGAIN - for the wisdom and magic of Peter Jackson!    It's reaaally good! Go and see...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Wow.  That's really all I have to say.  Wow.  I had never watched Firefly before, in fact I just don't watch much TV at all these days.  But I saw a quick trailer for Serenity and thought, \\"eh, that looks cool, I guess we'll go see it to hold me over until Narnia and King Kong\\".  Boy was I shocked when this film rolled.  I was treated with a film that had less than 1/3 the budget of the last star wars, but Serenity was better written, better acted, better paced, and just about anything else you can put after the word \\"better\\". <br /> <br />The one thing that impressed me the most was that the creators of Serenity never seemed to relegate themselves to the typical \\"look, it's sci-fi, so just go with it, it's not always gonna make perfect sense\\" that so many Star Wars movies and it's clones have fallen into.  Serenity does nothing that it doesn't explain.  For example, at first I assumed (from past movie-going experience) that the \\"Reavers\\" were the obligatory evil presence with no explanationa and little motivation for being evil.  But I was enthralled when the presence of the reavers was believably and logically explained later on in the film.  Kudos to the filmakers! <br /> <br />There are numerous things like this in the film that go so far in truly creating an experience for the filmgoer.  Yes, there is some cheesy dialogue, and more one-liners than you can shake a stick at, but that's Whedon's style (at least I realize now that it is after watching the first few episodes of Firefly). <br /> <br />I know I'll be stoned for saying this, but I honestly believe that Serenity is a better movie than any of the 6 Star Wars films.  Granted, Star Wars has a certain appeal to it because of the cultural significance and the circularity of the movies, but Whedon's storytelling makes George Lucas look like junior high play.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I love the X-Men, Spiderman and even Fantastic 4 movies as I think they let you be a kid again but at the same time at least in X-Men you have some political thinking too!!<br /><br />I admit I am a fan of Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman and Halley Berry who all do an excellent job on their characters.  I also enjoyed getting to know the younger fans and more on Magneto and Mystique.  The new Nightcrawler is a great character and fine acting as well.<br /><br />Whenever you just want to escape and have fun -- this is the movie to see or rent!  I look forward to X3!!
B00001NFCY|5.0|Ever since Creed broke up I have been saying to myself...what the hell??? Alter Bridge and a solo Scott Stapp...THEY BOTH SOUND LIKE CREED!!! I loved Human Clay, ALL the albums... but it makes you think that while they where good when they where a THEY if you add up Scott Stapp's album to Alter Bridge's album you get the amount of sales of a Creed album....this is what confuses me as to why they broke up in the first place. Human Clay was a great album, only reason it's great is because they where together!!! Makes you miss 1999!!!!
6305692572|5.0|This movie gave me hope that I could find a a solution.  I will always be grateful.
B0002IU988|1.0|Unfortunately I am not one of the Alter Bridge fans and let me tell you why. I was a huge Creed fan, I had the shirts I had the albums, I was a big Creed fan. Now when the Alter Bridge album debut came out I was eager to hear the music. I was dissapointed to find that even though the band members where there it sounded like a stappless Creed. Myles Kennedy to me has no talent whatsoever he sounds like a cross between Three Doors Down and Keith Urban. Two very good bands when mixed together=Myles Kennedy. I'm sorry to say that he didn't impress me at the least bit. Music is still the band but Kennedy doesn't live up to Scott Stapp's voice, which draws you in and keeps you there. The Great Divide got my vote, I think Scott Stapp did a better job this year than Alter Bridge.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|as with their first album, it took a while before this one sank in.  but once it did, what a trip A Perfect Circle takes you on! <br /> <br />this album is an emotional rollercoaster and it is vital to listen to the CD straight through, not on random tracks.  \\"The Package\\" opens up slowly but builds up nicely to a heavy closing.  \\"Weak and Powerless\\" keeps an upbeat pace and is somewhat positive, even if it is tempting sin.  the strongest song is \\"The Noose.\\"  dark and smoldering, its build up is phenomenal and leads you to an abrupt end and awakening. <br /> <br />\\"Blue\\" is again \\"upbeat\\" and wonders if you really want to know where the trip that APC is taking you.  the next two tracks -- \\"Vanishing\\" and \\"A Stranger\\" suspend things for a while and allows a calm to come over you leading into \\"The Outsider,\\" where the listener is becoming \\"disconnected\\" from those not on the ride.  \\"Crimes\\" is a countdown of sorts and leads to the oft-criticized, but beautiful \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me.\\"  \\"Pet\\" is an attempt to calm you while the song itself is not being calm (and somewhat unstable).  heavy and emotional, it is as though they are trying to convince you that the \\"sins\\" or pains of the trip are not going to hurt you --  to \\"go back to sleep\\" and enjoy the ride. <br /> <br />One last interlude (perhaps the \\"echo of the solitary siren\\" that was mentioned in \\"Weak and Powerless\\") leads to the release of \\"Gravity\\" -- a calming end to APC rollercoaster. <br /> <br />so is it a drug trip?  perhaps.  but for argument sake, let's just say it is a trip that APC wants you to go on -- with or without mind-altering elements.  perhaps it is all an attempt to get individuals to overcome the pains of letting go (whatever it is they are holding on to).  APC gives you twelve steps to help you get started; taking the Thirteenth Step is up to you. <br /> <br />Definitely recommended to everyone.  some may find the slow down on tracks five and six to be a turn off, but only if you listen tothe album randomly.  but listening to the album from track one through track twelve is definitely the best way to experience \\"Thirteenth Step.\\" <br /> <br />Highlight tracks: \\"The Package\\" \\"The Noose\\" \\"Pet\\"
B00000DHZJ|5.0|I wasn't a Jimi Hendrix fan until this year when I decided to buy Experience Hendrix out of the blue - I really had no idea what his music sounded like.  This is quite possibly my favorite album of all time.  Each song is catchy and unique, and musically superior. <br /> <br />I particularly enjoyed \\"Red House\\" for its blues feel, and \\"Dolly Dagger\\" for its cinematic sound and lyrics.  Hendrix is one of the few who has written lyrics that I truly enjoy.  The carefully written \\"Bold as Love\\" is another one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Hendrix also impresses me with his political expression! <br /> <br />And of course, he manages some amazing work on the guitar.
B0000024K1|5.0|You're an idiot. I don't ever recall Danny trashing this record. And stop using your dumb racist words, it's stupid as hell. But you're right about MTV supporter, so I'll give you that.    Now I'm making this review short. As for this album, this is by far the best of all of Public Enemy's albums. Chuck D is at his best with his lyrical rhymes here. Flava Flav adds some good \\"flava\\" in this album by being comical with Chuck. And Terminator X is at his best \\"speaking with his hands\\" on the turntables and mixers.    This is what REAL Rap/Hip-Hop should be like, not the dumb \\"I want to see your booties and get filthy rich\\"  and \\"I wanna be gangsta\\" themes like the vast majority of today's Rap is. Get this album. And ignore \\"thaman,\\" he's a fool who thinks Black people are better than all races.
0307276902|4.0|This is such a powerful book. James Frey does a tremendous job allowing people to really get inside his head and know exactly how he is feeling. The sentences are short and choppy but if you read the book as if you were James experiencing what he has and really put yourself in the moment it is so inspiring. To know that somebody has gone from the absolute bottom and acheived success when nobody believed puts tears in my eyes.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005NKKY|5.0|This album is brilliant from beginning to end!  It's got it's share of immediate hits, as well as immensely rewarding 'growers'!  Tracks such as 'Punky's Dilemma' and 'Old Friends' didn't jump out at me upon the first few listens, but they've since become favorites.  The only track that is skippable is only so because it's not a song ('Voices of Old People', which is still a good track) but rather a sound collage.<br /><br />The way the strings at the end of 'Old Friends' swell and become dissonant, only to return to the final resounding chord?  Glorious!<br /><br />'Save the Life Of My Child' - listen to those ghostly voices in the background, and the synth that starts the song.<br /><br />If you like thoughtful arrangement, progressive, yet tasteful,  studio technique, and incredible songwriting - you will LOVE 'Bookends'.
0451528956|2.0|Robert Louis Stevenson portrays every man's double character and how one chooses who he is in this mysterious and full of suspense story in which we see enfold the urge to know who Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are. We see the whole mishaps through the mind and point of view of Mr. Utterson, who is a lawyer and respected friend of Jekyll. His curiosity leads into getting himself involved on the strange transformation his good friend is suffering of, and after a murder, the itch to know intensifies as Utterson decides to end all the mystery for once and for all. To do this, he counts with the help of Dr. Lanyon, another of Jekyll's good friends and Mr. Poole, Jekyll's butler. <br /> <br />Set in London, England, around the 1870's, Stevenson describes the city, buildings and people as if they were real and the reader becomes Mr. Utterson and can actually see all the things he sees as the reader becomes another character in the story, following the prying of men to know everything.   <br /> <br />Stevenson writes in a captivating matter and is always up to the idea of describing thoroughly the environment in which the plot unfolds right at the most anticipated moments of the story. <br /> <br />The characters were real and credible, some may even be compared to people on our own lives, but I found that the whole plot was a slow going at the beginning and came as an intense rush towards the end. <br /> <br /> <br />On the other hand, there seemed too much suspense on the story for such a short and simple explanation. Since this story is very old and famous, the book cannot be much appreciated since almost everyone knows what is known to happen to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by either word of mouth, by watching movies or by others that also refer to this book and situation which lowers the reader's itch to know the solution to the plot.  <br /> <br /> A double personality everyone has, in which one should be chosen over the other. This seems as looking everything in black and white, when most of the things and people are grey. There is always the constant struggle of choosing whether the good or bad option which we know clearly, but a bad one amidst a million good does not convert you into your evil self. The book also portrays that once you turn evil; you cannot go back, which in a way I agree on since the guilt of the malicious things done would be a too great burden for an innocent person to live with. Still, being positive minded, I'd like to believe it's never too late to change, and that without the need of potions, only through determination, Jekyll could have found an inner strength to suppress his evil side and transform back into himself, which is what many people have proven to be able to do these days.  <br /> <br />Jekyll is a wealthy man from a respectable family. He finds the need to divide himself into two sides to be able to do the things he wishes to do without damaging or ruining his reputation. To do this, he uses a potion he created that divides his evil and good side and created Mr. Edwards Hyde, whose name could be a symbol to J's living style in which he feels suppressed and hidden. To do all this he does take precautions such as selecting Hyde as his inheritor, letting his household keepers that Hyde is allowed, writing a letter explaining all, being all secretive... but he did not expect his supplies to run over or his \\"evil side\\" to overrule him, which later results in Hyde killing himself. I believed the story had a greater potential and could have been more developed.   <br />
0609610570|5.0|I found this book to be superb. Few people tell it like it is told in this work and I'm surprised to see it is only 3.5 stars. That is a testament to how many people out there today in leadership positions dont get it. Bossidy has been there and done it and I tell you this is a must read if you want your organization to get things done and not just talk about it. If we had more people like Bossidy we'd have fewer Enron's, GM's and the like. Great read.
B000062YAZ|5.0|I bought this album about a month ago, with a gift card. I had heard samples and didn't really like it but I could only find one other CD I really wanted and thought the album cover was really cool so picked it up. The first chords of Angel Of Death are what the album is all about, full out utter aggression meant to flatten you. I listened to the album in its 28 minute entirety. The tracks that stuck out most were Angel of Death with its slow groove oriented middle section (depraved), Altar of Sacrifice, Postmortem, Criminally Insane, and Raining Blood the awesome closer. However more listens showed that the entire album pretty much kicked ass (bar reborn). I also listen to Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Megadeth but had never heard anything this extreme before. This album does become a little one sided as their isn't quite enough variation but taken as a whole its like a unified depraved violent aggressive vision. I've heard all these songs a ton of times by now, but it seems to never get boring, which is why it has such a high rating. Is it the best metal album ever? No I still think Judas Priests Painkiller, and Maiden's The Number of The beast offer more depth and probably better musicianship though Slayer definately have their own distinctive style which they've mastered, showcasing some of the fastest and most twisted solos and riffs I have ever heard. However thrash fans can rejoice, this is easily the best thrash album ever far superior to Metallica's boring overly long monotonous (yes way more monotonous and boring than Slayer believe it or not)albums. (though rust in peace comes very close to being this good) Also Tom's voice isn't as bad as everyone says it fits the music very well, its not really screaming or singing sort of like a military drill sergeant that never runs out of breath and he has a killer scream he uses occasionally. Overall an adrenaline pumped album that never gets boring well that anyone with an even casual interest in metal fan shouldtry.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Unfairly classified as pure sci-fi - this movie is long on the witty, quick dialogue and subplots and and does not rely on the overused digital effects. Was recommended to me and was fairly shocked at how intelligent and engrossing an experience it was. Highly recommended for those of you looking for something other than the sophmoric bathroom humor comedies that plague hollywood these days.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|This album has been well reviewed and it should be understood that this is Megadeth's most publicly accessable record (it was a risk, hense the title)... simply put, in my opinon: Megadeth is the greatest band to walk the planet, but RISK is their worst album! Now it might not be as good as the rest of the Megadeth catalogue BUT it's still an amazing album by any standards and I dare say if you hand't heard the rest of Megadeth's work prior to hearing risk you'd think you'd just struck pure gold! <br /> <br />My advice on buying this album however is to seek the original recording. The remastered version destroys the intro's to some songs and some annoying backing vocals have been added in places. Plus the 'bonus' tracks ain't no bonus if you ask me, absolute terrible versions of the originals. There is a Enhanced recording of RISK which has the tracks in their original form but also includes a short video of the making of the album... PLEASE try get your hands on this one before opting for the remaster. <br />RATTLE YER GODDAMN HEADS!
B00005JO1Y|5.0|first i will state that i am NOT objective, as a result of my 15 year long expectation to see the classic kong redone with modern technologies, my absolute contempt for the de-laurentiis sacrilege, and a life-long fetish of dinosaurs, especially from the old school that began with jules verne and sir arthur conan doyle, the apothesis of which king kong is. <br /> <br />i am in awe of what we have here, an epic tribute to that sub-genre in adventure fiction, all too rare in this day and age, with gothic touches reminiscent of fritz lang, murnau, and coketau. the world of kong is extremely well planned, and the brontosaur stampade is everything i ever wanted to see . kong himself is a titan while carl denham is indeed a promethean figure. the only sour note for me was the exclusion of some scenes from the original trailer, and the speculation about dinosaurs filmed but also excluded. which brings me to the issue of cuts: even those who believe the film is too long, will only benefit from a LONGER dvd version. <br />yes, LONGER, since not only will we get more exciting scenes, but also a fuller and richer plot, which would bring us closer to the spirit of the classic adventure stories. so, please opt for more rather than less in this film which is a dream come true for me as well as meny others, i hope.
B000002H72|5.0|I first heard the Pixies at a friends house in the late 80's. He had just been to England and said that this band were huge there at the moment.  He played me Doolittle (just released) then Surfa Rosa (me mate preferred it to Doolittle.) I immediately fell in love with the band... they were just so unlike anything else around at the time. The rifftastic precision of AC/DC married to Velvet Underground-esque lyrical sophisication. Guitar solos that didn't rely on timeworn scales and runs, yet sounded perfect... and all that screaming in Spanish!  I was amazed at the drum sound on Surfa Rosa...  finally a producer had arrived who new how to record drums. <br /> <br />I immediately acquired all the Pixies albums released to date... and though i love them all equally I think Doolittle is the greatest testament to their genius. The rough edges of Surfa Rosa have been honed into one of the most sublime pop albums ever released. My fave trax are \\"No. 13 Baby\\" (for its amazing Link Wray-esque surf guitar solo coda) \\"I Bleed\\"... because it really is a spooky song and has that unsettling, you could die tomorrow sort of mood the Pixies did so well, and Kims harmonies are superb, and Crackity Jones... Frank Black lyrical outrageousness at its best... the band blasting away at full speed... so tight everything perfectly orchestrated. However, every song is an absolute gem and the sign of a great album is that everyone has a different fave song.

B0006L16N8|5.0|How can the anti-DRM campaign lose its credibility the fastest? When they exaggerate the problems associated with copy-protected CDs, and the majority of people experience no problems. They will think the critics were full of hot air and won't think twice about those negatively impacted. <br /> <br />Anyway, back to the review. I think X&Y is right up there with A Rush of Blood to the Head. AROBTTH will always be my favorite, but X&Y has a consistency of high quality that can't be ignored. With every listen I have a new favorite.
0385338686|4.0|This holiday season I decided to catch up on some of the reading I'd been neglecting. Books by some of my favorite authors have been piling up on my nightstand. My first choice was Sophie Kinsella's Undomestic Goddess (UG). After reading Ms. Kinsella's shopaholic series and Can You Keep a Secret I was sure it would be a winner. (UG) did not disappoint! This gem of a book is written in the chick-lit genre. It's about a high-powered, workaholic 29yr old lawyer who works so much she's forgotten to have a life. After making a career-ending mistake the main character, Samantha flees to the countryside and a chance encounter changes her life and career-path. As Samantha takes on the role of a housekeeper the fun begins. Going from a London Lawyer with a blackberry to an Edbury (small town in England) Housekeeper with a toilet brush is quite a change and the antics Samantha goes through to keep her new job will have you laughing out loud. The Undomestic Goddess is highly enjoyable and I can't wait to read Ms. Kinsella's next book!
0425152251|5.0|I so envy the talent of an author like Jostein Gaarder who is able to craft such a clever book. If someone has no interest in philosophy at all, they might find the book boring. However, for anyone who has even a passing interest in the subject, this book will grab their attention, entertain them, and provide them with a solid philosophy 101 introduction to the subject. Using the vehicle of a novel, Mr. Gaarder provided a thought provoking read that weaves fiction and non-fiction into and out of each other many times. I think this book should be required reading for everyone at some point in their late high school or college years. The world would funtion as a better place if every human on the planet possessed at least the basic knowledge provided in this book. Unfortunately, probably less then one hundredth of one percent of people in the world even come close to understanding what this book teaches.

0156421178|5.0|Like many I suspect, my knowledge of  George Orwell's writing begun and ended with 1984 and Animal Farm. However, recently much to my pleasure I have started to discover some of Orwell lesser well known, but equally brilliant works. <br /> <br />Homage to Catalonia is the story of Orwell's time serving in the republican (government) forces in the Spanish civil war. Homage is part memoir, part adventure tale, part history and part dissection of the politics which finally destroyed the  republican cause. Orwell originally went to Spain to serve as a correspondent but shortly after arrival joined to the Socialist P.O.U.M militia, a decision which was made largely at random but which was to bring Orwell into conflict with the mainline communist supported government, and which finally forced Orwell to flee Spain after the P.O.U.M's suppression. Orwell's description of warfare, including the chaos of the actual fighting, the difference in experience between senior command and the soldiers on the ground, the period of extended boredom where more mundane concerns such as staying warm, obtaining cigarettes and the constant battle against lice are some of the finest that I have read. Also of note is Orwell's description of the sensation of being shot, which captures the fear of eminent death, but also a detachment which allowed him to lucidly record the experience.  <br /> <br />Finally if you are interested in the origins of 1984, Homage is important in that it shows how the political infighting within the republican side, including the pogroms which where conducted against the smaller non communist militia's and use of blatant falsehoods to discredit the cause of the socialist and anarchist militia's in the eyes of the world at large, served to shape Orwell's future political thinking and his distrust of totalitarian governments.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I was never a huge fan of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but I could certainly admire his tremendous achievement at bringing the trilogy to life. You certainly have to hand it to him, he's one of the most visionary directors working today and the fact that he can combine state of the art jaw dropping special effects with stories that are also deeply human and so often heartfelt, says a lot about his enormous talent.     Told in three parts, the story the story begins in New York where Ann Darrow (a ravishing Naomi Watts) works in vaudeville in Manhattan. When her theater closes, a desperate Ann runs into Carl Denham (Jack Black), a shady movie producer who's looking to make an adventure film on an island no one's sure even exists. Once Ann signs on, she meets playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), who has been tricked into sailing with Denham so he can finish the movie's script.     Once the group is shipwrecked on the island, the movie ramps it up, with the first appearance of the big hairy ape making a classically enormous entrance. Keep in mind that it takes almost 70 minutes for the three-hour movie to provide our first view of Kong. But once we meet him, the stage is set for a battle involving the scary human residents of the island and some of the most amazing looking prehistoric creatures that you will ever see on screen.     In fact, the Island sequence could be enough for one movie, as the unrestrained Jackson has Kong, Ann, and the shipwrecked humans going up against all kinds of scary creatures, including stampeding packs of bloodthirsty dinosaurs and hordes of monster insects with super-viscous insides. This is a nerve giggling, audacious spectacular movie that ultimately will go down as one of the years best.     Of course, Ann eventually realizes she can handle Kong, and she charming and entertaining the beast with her vaudeville. Kong falls in love with her becoming her protector, while Ann holds a deep gratitude to him for saving her life.  And it just adds to the movie's poignancy because we know that she's the only being to whom Kong seems connected.     Insatiability trumps trustworthiness and kindliness, and Denham eventually captures Kong anesthetizing him and putting him on display in New York, as a carnival spectacle. The movie culminates atop the Empire State Building - in a series of startling effects sequences  - where Jackson creates an emotional whirlwind around Ann and Kong.     The acting is generally top notch with Watts turning in an especially nuanced and earthy performance as Ann. She could have camped it up, but to her credit, she plays it straight. The rest of the cast is also impressive, perfectly cast in their respective roles. Kyle Chandler does a lovely supporting turn as Bruce Baxter the preening actor who plays the first mate and Ann's love interest in Denham's movie and supplies the silly, B-movie dialogue for the film within the film; and Adrien Brody is also good as the offbeat, ruminative and ineffectual playwright who falls in love with Ann and sees through Denham but lacks the ability to stop him.    Yes, the film is bloated and overstuffed and the middle section of the film is a little too long, but Kong's climactic scenes in New York are acted with such clarity and precision against a backdrop of such breathtaking sweep and detail of Jackson's re-created 1933 Manhattan, that it's excesses almost assume an operatic grandeur. Despite its shortcomings, Jackson's Kong is - especially in its last two-thirds - a thing of raging beauty, a gorgeous hairy beast that packs the unadulterated emotional whack of a tearjerker.

015626224X|5.0|As an avid reader, I had read both 1984 and Animal Farm many years ago, but was largely unaware of Orwell's other works, so I picked up Down and Out largely on a whim.  Down and Out has turned into a very pleasant surprise combining amazing narrative, incredible observations on human condition and some of the clearest purest prose that I have read for many years.  <br />Down and Out is a semi autobiographical tale written in the period of Orwell's life after he had left the Indian Police force and dedicated himself to becoming a writer. During this period Orwell, lived hand to mouth in Paris in a series of cheap hotels doing whatever menial jobs were available including working as a dishwasher in an overprice hotel and in a small specialty restaurant. As a word of warning, I would not recommend reading this section before going down to your local restaurant - you may loose you appetite. When he returned to London, Orwell lived for several weeks as a tramp traveling from Hostels to \\"Spikes\\" living off charity, while awaiting for a teaching position to become available.  <br />In Down and Out, Orwell manages to treat the lives of his fellow tramps and plongeurs - those people who have dropped through the cracks of society - with a sense of compassion and  understanding, rather than the contempt that is reserved for them by the majority of society. He shows them as men and women who have failed for a variety of reasons, including mental and physical illness and simple bad financial luck. Orwell also shows that once an individual has fallen into poverty without friends and resources they often face a near insurmountable task  to resurrect themselves in the eyes of society, resulting in the creation their own society driven by its owns rules and codes.
B000003TBP|5.0|Odelay is one of those albums that leaves you smiling and thinking all at once. There are all kinds of genres crossed in this album. You'll hear funk, rap, bossa nova(he quotes Antonia Carlos Jobim briefly) and rock. The most interesting part of this album is not only the lesser known songs but that it still sounds fresh today almost ten years after it's release(June 18, 1996). There is something for everyone one this album which makes it a popular hit at parties. I'm new to Beck and Alternative Rock and I think I'll buy his Mellow Gold album next.

0393035158|1.0|As a Christian scholar with a skeptical streak, I am always on the look-out for good attacks on my faith. Harris, a neuroscientist and Stanford grad, is bright. He has a gift for good, straight rhetorical jabs -- \\"120 million of us place the big bang at 2,500 years after the Babylonians and Sumerians learned to brew beer;\\" \\"It should go without saying that these rival belief systems are all equally uncontaminated by evidence.\\" And there is no doubt he is aiming at theistic faith. He wants to show that (1) Religious faith does not care about evidence; (2) It is also contrary to the evidence; (3) Religion is more harmful than just about anything; (4) Moderation in religion is no virtue; (5) We can get by without God anyway, thank you very much, and (6 ) The only good thing about religion is the unitive state of consciousness, as experienced in Advetic and Buddhist meditative practice.  <br />  <br />Harris did not challenge my faith, though, for a simple reason: he appears almost entirely ignorant of what Christians think, why we think it, and gobs more.  Despite a long bibliography, in essence Harris is asking us to take his points on blind, or at least tunnel-visioned, faith.   <br />  <br />First, in his discussion of faith itself, Harris reveals how thinly he has read in Christian thought. Referring to a few Bible verses and often out-of-context quotes, Harris concludes that religious faith by definition is \\"an act of knowledge that has a low degree of evidence,\\" or none at all. He ponderously and repeatedly informs us that such \\"faith\\" is a bad idea. Of course it is! The fact is, the need to base faith on evidence has been the NORMAL Christian position for two thousand years. (Including such central thinkers as -- list alert! -- Justin, Clement, Origin, Gregory of Nazianzus and of Nyssa, Augustine, Aquinus, Calvin, Matteo Ricci, Descartes, Locke, Pascal (The \\"wager\\" is not all he wrote!), Cotton Mather, John Wesley, Kepler, Schaeffer, C. S. Lewis, J.P. Moreland,John Eccles, John Paul II (read fairly), Richard Swinburne, Mortimer Adler, and John Polkinghorne.  I can provide quotes for anyone who wants them.) In fact, Harris' view depends on stacking the deck and culpable ignorance.  He cherry-picks a few quotes to show Pascal and Augustine in the worst possible light, pans John Paul's thoughtful book in a glib sentence or two, misrepresenting his views on faith, and ignores the rest entirely.  <br />  <br />Harris is wrong then to assume that in theory, Christianity recommends \\"blind faith.\\" But what about practice? How does Harris' argument that religious faith \\"floats entirely free of evidence and reason\\" make out? Or his argument that \\"religion\\" is liable to get us all killed, and freedom from religion to save us?  <br />  <br />Here again, the problem is not that Harris grapples with contrary arguments and loses, but that he does not appear to have met any at all. I realize some of the examples I give may sound fantastic to readers who share Harris' views. But the only way one can know if they ARE fantastic is by reading and fairly considering these arguments; to deny arguments without reading them is simply to beg the question.  <br />  <br />Harris is a philosopher. Has he read debates between William Lane Craig and leading atheist philosophers on the existence of God? Has he read such seminal philosophers as Plantinga (at Notre Dame) and Swinburne (Oxford)? These folk are several rungs above him in the academic pecking order. He has a right to challenge their arguments. But for a neophyte to dismiss the contrary claims of leading thinkers in his field without so much as a mention, reveals an arrogance, ignorance, or both, that disqualify his views in the mind of any reflective person.  <br />  <br />In the 20th Century, leading astronomers were shocked to find the universe had a beginning, sometimes resisting the idea because it seemed to veer too close to Genesis. Many have also been amazed to find how finely tunedthe cosmos appears for life. (See quotes by Einstein, Jastrow, Davies, Penzias, Ellis, etc in Ross, Creator and the Cosmos.) Steve Hawking credits the same Augustine upon whom Harris heaps such scorn with being the first person to realize that time began with the universe -- an idea he and other early Christian thinkers likely derived from Scripture. What does Harris have to say in response to these well-known facts? Nada.    <br />  <br />Harris also ignores the Pullitzer-Prize winning arguments of the atheist psychologist Ernest Becker, who records his shock at finding the insights of Otto Rank closely following the \\"naive\\" Biblical intuitions of Kierkegaard: \\"Such a mixture of intense clinical insight and pure Christian theology is absolutely heady. One doesn't know what kind of emotional attitude to adopt towards it.\\" Harris has his attitude picked out: contempt, based on unsullied ignorance.  <br />  <br />Nor does Harris deal well with history. If evidence for the resurrection is so bad, how do people like William Lane Craig come off so well in debates with leading skeptics? Has Harris tackled the arguments of the great British historian N. T. Wright for the resurrection, or the evidence Gary Habermas has amassed after a thorough review of the relevant literature? How does he deal with the detailed arguments of sociologist Rodney Stark (and leading secular historians) that Christian theism led to the invention of science and the end of slavery? What does he say to Indian philosopher Vishal Mangalwadi, who argues that the mysticism Harris loves ruined India, and Christian reform helped save it? Or Shanghai historian Gu Weiming on how the Gospel helped China? Was the great scholar Hu Shi (a skeptic and colleague of the founder of the Chinese Communist Party) mistaken when he said Christian missionaries \\"taught us many things, the greatest of which was to look at women as people?\\" How does he respond to U-Cal Berkley historian Irwin Scheimer who described the great good \\"Samurai Christians\\" did in Japan? Has he read Brian Tierney's anthology in which medieval philosophers quote the New Testament as they formulated the modern concept of separation of church and state? Or Stanford anthropologist Rene Girard's argument that the Gospels \\"secretly controlled\\" the long process by which mankind realized that the poor and weak should be treated kindly?  <br />  <br />On all this and more, Harris offers not a peep. He simply asserts, over and over again, that only a child or a fool would think there is evidence for religion. He even shows contempt for the Bible as literature, in the teeth of the views of even great writers who were atheists.  This is fanaticism.     <br />  <br />Nor, as informed reviewers note below, does Harris do better in regard to Buddhism, on the history of which he is surprisingly naive.  (Tibet Buddhists, white hats, Chinese, black hats?  There have been entire dynasties when Tibetan Buddhists were the oppressors and the Chinese were on the receiving end!  As for Inquisitions, I could show you hot springs in Japan where Catholics were boiled to death.)       <br />  <br />Nor, again, does Harris deal seriously with the most spectacular social experiment of modern times -- the rise and fall of Marxism-Leninism. He mentions communism three times, only to dismiss it as a secular \\"religion,\\" along with Naziism -- which he blames on Christianity!  But in the 20th Century, communists helped one third of the planet throw off the bonds of religion. Harris writes of the Inquisition, \\"There is no other instance in which so many ordinary men and women have been so deranged by their beliefs in God.\\" Yet over twenty-five years, Joseph Stalin alone killed more innocent people EVERY DAY on average than the Spanish Inquisition over all Spanish dominions in all of 300 YEARS! (Read the books, Harris, and do the math!) Communist torturers taunted victims with some of the same enlightenment slogans he finds so liberating. (Lenin himself shared Harris' view of religion, and his talent for anti-religious hyperbole: \\"A thousand epidemics and plagues are to be preferred to the slightest notion of a god.\\")  Despite this history, names like \\"Solzhenitsyn\\" and \\"Wurmbrand\\" are absent from his bibliography.  I have known some of the victims.   <br /> <br />A rabbit in the Chronicles of Narnia sat by a great waterfall and listened to whispered conversations a hundred miles away.  So Harris sits in close chronological proximity to a roar of suffering caused by his fellow skeptics, and hears the pin-prick of the Inquisition a thousand miles away.  If a materialists want to argue that religion is harmful, they need to grips with the dark side of anti-religious history.       <br />  <br />How could anyone make it through one of our best universities, study in graduate school, write a book for a major publisher, and take such a profoundly shallow and ignorant approach to his subject? And this book is lavishly praised by the Economist, Guardian, New York Times, Amazon, Richard Dawkins, and -- sorry to see -- John Derbyshire!  His ignorance is obviously a symptom of something in the air, but seems self-imposed as well. He has, after all, read the Bible, along with a few great Christian thinkers of the past. But he notices only the worst. He is like a person who goes into a mine of rich gems, and comes out with scraps of sub-bituminous coal.  <br />  <br />On page 13 Harris complains that \\"The central tenet of every religious tradition is that all other religions are mere repositories of error.\\" As a scholar of religion, I consider this ignorant poppycock, as regards many religions, including my own. But on page 15, Harris writes, \\"The very ideal of religious tolerance is one of the principle forces driving us towards the abyss.\\" So \\"religions\\" are intolerant and therefore bad, and yet his own intolerence will save us, somehow.  <br />  <br />One feels, as William James put it, an \\"impatience at the ridiculous swagger of the program, in view of what its authors are actually able to perform.\\"  Like fireworks over a lake, Harris' rhetoric sizzles, but little but himself is illumined, still less set ablaze.  <br />  <br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Man
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I bought this CD regardless of all the bad reviews it had here. It sounds like John Mayer to me with a definite blues sound. John has been on Austin City limits with Buddy Guy and still people think he is un original and somehow a fake. He locked himself in his room when he was young and played his butt off and guess what he got good. He sure has sold lots of cd's to suck. I will never forget the night he played on the Grammy's and stole the show. That was the year he beat out James Taylor in his first appearance. The only reason I give this a 4 star rating is the sound mix. Just a little bass heavy for me but the bass player is killer no doubt. Go get this cd and you make the call for yourself.
0553382179|3.0|I like the suggestions to set a timer and spend 15 minutes in one room clearing clutter. This works for me, especially when I'm having trouble getting started. When it seems like just too big a job, then the 15 minute tip overcomes my resistance. Sure, I can manage 15 minutes. Once I start, I'm so encouraged by the results that I keep going.<br />Making something routine (making the bed, emptying the dishwasher) is a big help for me. My old tendency was to note something needing attention and promise myself to get to it later. Making the bed is now automatic to me and I don't even think of it as a chore. As you create the habit of tidiness, one chore at a time, your home becomes an attractive haven to you, not the constant reproach of undone tasks.<br />I did knock off 2 stars on the review for the drawbacks pointed out by some other reviews. The tips are great and do work for many, but the tone and organization of the book could improve.  Most of us have tried a variety of clutter-busting books.  Maybe this is the one that will fit you and make a change in your life.<br />I recommend also reading The 10 Minute Clutter Control and Christopher Lowell's Seven Layers of Organization: Unclutter Your Home, Unclutter Your Life.
0689865384|5.0|I first heard about this book from my Honors Language Arts teacher when we did Lit Circles. I chose the book because it looked interesting, and I was astounded when it turned out to be better than I thought it would. Scott Westerfeld has a way of creating characters that are down-to-earth and have their own share of flaws.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading adventure books with a touch of romance. Since there are some scenes that may be inappropriate for younger children, I would guess anyone above the age of 12 could read this book.
0679424741|5.0|I picked \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" up before Oprah Winfrey mentioned the book and put it in her club.  Interestingly enough, the book was referenced to me by someone who is quite different from Oprah:  The late controversial poet and novelist Charles Bukowski, \\"The laureate of the low lifes,\\" as Time referred to him disgustedly.  For the last five years I have been utterly obsessed with this man and his writings.  It was Bukowski who had turned me on to other fantastic writers like John Fante, Celine, Ezra Pound, and Sherwood Anderson.  He also name drops Carson McCullers in many of his poems and in some of his published interviews (As a big fan of Henry Miller, I found out that McCullers was also a favorite of this author of \\"Tropic of Cancer\\" and the Sexus/Plexus/Nexus trilogy).  So I picked up as many of her books as I could find, and I started off by reading \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.\\"   <br /> <br />And what a fantastic book it is. <br /> <br />I could identify with so many of the characters in this book (published in 1940) that I was like, \\"where has this book been my whole life?\\"  Unbelievable!  Yes, it is sad in some few parts but it is never \\"sappy\\" sad.  For me, the saddest part was when Bubber accidently shoots another small child - and whereas before this incident Bubber was a chipper, talkative boy who liked dressing up in costumes (although he was often made fun of for it) and singing, he breaks down after the accident and becomes totally withdrawn, and stops playing with other kids. <br /> <br />It is remarkable to think that Carson McCullers had the keen political and social insight to write this book at the age of 23.  This book was years ahead of its time in its social and political commentaries.  Besides the aforementioned gun accident (which subtly painted an ugly picture of a culture obsessed with guns), this book addresses class struggle, racism, bigotry, political apathy, materialism, drug abuse, the inequalities of the criminal justice system, and other important issues. <br /> <br />Most of this book found me smiling and nodding my head up and down.  This is so true in reading about Blount and Dr. Copeland.  Blount is a white, blue collar worker who is frustrated with the capitalist system in America, but he is laughed at by other poor whites and greeted with apathetic indifference when he suggests that they should band together and strike for better conditions.  Copeland is a black doctor who also tries to get black people in this depression-era town to strike, but he is greeted with the same responses as Blount.  In fact, the poor whites and the poor blacks in this town would rather remain separate from one another drowning to the bottom of their liquor bottles than to try to make their lives better.   <br /> <br />Political apathy?  My, how little has changed from 1940 to 2005.  <br /> <br />When I first read this book I had to force myself to put it down, and every year I find myself re-reading the entire book or parts of it.   <br /> <br />All I can say is that this is a fantastic novel, one of my top five books of all time.  I don't know how or why this book could merit less than five stars.  Read it.

6304873441|4.0|One of the few movies made by the now non-existent Fox Animation Studios, this is their best attempt at creating a masterpiece. Many beautiful backdrops (i.e. the ballroom), wonderfully written songs, and a fantastic love story make this movie well worth watching.<br /><br />The acting could be much better, including both the voice acting, and the non-verbal expressions in the animation. My biggest critique of the movie though is the Ras Putin subplot. The real villain in this movie was deception, and it almost conquered the hearts of the protagonists. Without the little demon fairies, the evil sorcerer, this movie could have been amazing. A simple re-edit to exclude those elements would have made a much more memorable movie experience.
B00008S2VG|4.0|This album wasn't given enough credit when it came out. It made the top 40, but didn't get any higher on the charts. All the songs on there are great (the standout track is \\"Intervention\\"). Now that her new album \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is out and on top of the charts, people have seemed to forget about this CD. Yeah, her newest album is better than \\"American Lfe\\" but this should have been given a better chance. It's a must for all people who listen to pop/techno.
B00005JKES|5.0|No, Twin Peaks is not for all tastes.  However, the show is undeniably intriguing, moving, well-acted, and beautiful.  The quirky, dark comedy mixed with the creepy surrealism makes for a hugely original show and a mesmerizing viewing experience.  Kyle MacLachlan's memorable and eccentric turn as intuitive Agent Dale Cooper makes for a different sort of charismatic lead, the ensemble acting is strong, and Mark Frost's and David Lynch's writing is always fascinating.    I enjoyed every episode of this DVD set, and all of the special features are wonderful.  I highly recommend this Special Edition to any fan of David Lynch and/or film noir, or to anyone looking for something fresh, fun, and unique.  It should be noted, however, that this DVD set does not include the pilot episode.
0553573403|5.0|This book rocks! I totally enjoyed it. The action was good and kept me interested. Unlike other authors these days, this one has a way of making it interesting as well as diverse. In a world of Robert Jordans, this man stands apart. Another one I'd reccomend is Brian S. Pratt's The Unsuspecting Mage, while not as diverse as this one, at least keeps you intrigued and interested, which is what every reader wants.<br /><br />Mr. Martin gives you that, and more so. If there is but one book you want to read, it's this one
B000AARKOO|4.0|This is not a particularly good movie.  Orlando Bloom is supposed to carry most of the weight of this movie, and, continuing the work he did in Troy and Pirates of the Caribbean, his acting is consistently outpaced by those around him.  Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton, Liam Neeson, and Ghassan Massoud all act rings around Bloom (and to a slightly lesser extent, Eva Green as well.)  This makes for a decidedly lopsided movie, one in which I was hoping for less screen time for the stars, and more from the bit players. <br /> <br />Other than the lack of chemistry and believability of the two stars, I thoughly enjoyed this movie.  To those who find it historically unbelievable, I suggest Robert Payne's The Dream and the Tomb, Amin Maalouf's The Crusade Through Arab Eyes, or Johnathan Riley-Smith's The Oxford Illustrated History of the Crusades.  Balian's history is changed, and those he knighted were certainly not commoners, but the movie wasn't nearly as historically inaccurate as many people would have you beleive.  I won't say that Hollywood got it right (I'm not certain there were all that many secular humanists in the Crusader Era) but it didn't get it as wrong as it usually does.
B000AYNFWG|4.0|Unquestionably one of the most popular and influential movies of all time, Federico Fellini's masterpiece is presented digitally remastered in its entire rich, moody black and white splendor. Nino Rota's score remains crisp and expressive, and Fellini's smooth evocative camera work has seldom been equaled. This three-disc set comes, of course, with better than average filler (including a collection of never-before-seen Fellini shorts), including interviews with performers and writers, audio commentary by Richard Schickel and a variety of other ephemera. However, at the end of the day, and the beginning of the night, is there anyone as photogenic and lustrously beautiful as the film's two leading players?  It's almost as if Fellini's effort was to better the Hollywood glamour factory, and with Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni he succeeds. Their images glow as if lit from within, and all the angst and pain and shallowness of the '60s are mirrored in their radiant faces. La Dolce Vita reminds us, some 45 years after the film's initial release, that tales of celebrities and gossip mongers floating through life in search of meaning hasn't aged badly; that the scene with a luminous Ekberg basking in a Roman fountain is still awe inspiring, and that Fellini is, perhaps, the master movie maker of the twentieth century. A sweet film, indeed.
B000002J6F|4.0|After taking much abuse from the critics for his under-rated second album, and for strutting his English squier horseman self around in the time of peace and love, and for distancing himself from Crosby, Nash, and Young, Stephen Stills brought it all home on this two-record tour-de-force. <br /> <br />For once, Stills was able to indulge all of his various styles, and with a band that could keep up with him. There are a great many top-notch songs here, and the singing and playing has an honest quality lacking in the previous efforts, which leaned on endless overdubs and slick production. And, by this time, much of the hype around Stills had worn off, and the expectations were not as great.   <br /> <br />The highlight of the first section is Rock and Roll Crazies/Cuban Bluegrass, which shows Stills' latin side in full bloom. When he sings 'your feet leave the ground', he really means it. It certainly worked for me.  <br /> <br />Other gems include Johnny's Garden, Bound To Fall, The Treasure,  <br />and the last of his brilliantly inspired Judy Collins songs, So Begins The Task, which was later recorded by the lady herself. <br />If there is one song by Stephen Stills that anyone should hear, it's this one. Just make sure there isn't a bottle of something strong nearby. <br /> <br />It retrospect, it would have been wise to spread this material out over two albums. The regretable follow-up, Down The Road, marked the end of Still's lofty status as one of the better songwriters in the business, and he was forced into reunion status with Crosby, Nash, and Young, which once again pumped up the hype-machine, but didn't inspire much new quality material.  <br /> <br />A good accompanyment to this album is the German concert DVD, which shows Stills and band at the top of their form. The appearance is a bit dated, but the music is hard to beat.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Man, lotsa people are taking this movie way to seriously, particularly those who don't like it.  Frankly, I don't know what most of the negative reviewers were doing in the theater in the first place.  It's a big, stupid, over the top action-adventure movie that 3 hours long.  If that doesn't sound appealing to you, stay away.  Of course, I'm not typically that big on this kinda thing either.  I'm not really opposed to it in theory, but this kinda ultra-populist stuff is almost guaranteed to be to gutless and middle of the road.  Fortunately, Peter Jackson is no Michael Bay, and while I'm not as big on his stuff as many others, he definitely has a grasp on this sorta material.  Of course, this doesn't totally compare to the LOTR movies, as those were quite a bit more serious, but his ability to work with grand action scenes remains here.  And frankly, it seems like I shouldn't like this movie as much as I do, as it does have a number of problems.  But, what can I say, I had a helluva good time.<br /><br />Many, many people have complained that this movie is too long.  I disagree.  I mean, geez, it's an epic.  It's supposed to feel big and the length fits the general tone and mood of the film.  The increase in length is largely just a sorta ballooning of the elements that were already in the original.  The one major exception is the addition of the bizarre romantic relationship between Kong and Ann.  I think this works a lot better than I would've anticipated, but that no great feat as I anticipated that it wouldn't work at all.  I think it's interesting that this romantic subplot seems far more tailored for male tastes than female.  After all, it is the story of the big, stupid, ugly filthy man-beast that earns the love of beautiful woman for no apparent reason, other than, perhaps, the sheer fact that he really, really likes her.  That and I gotta wonder how many women are really wishing that King Kong will come take them away.  Still, though this stuff works alright, it's too drawn out.  To be blunt, these scenes take up a lot of screen time, and there just isn't a whole helluva that can happen in them, what with Kong being unable to talk and all.  So it largely comes down to alternating close-ups.  Man, you wouldn't believe how much time is spent with the camera pointing at Watts while she is looking at Kong in an affectionate manner.  Personally, I wouldn't have thought that a film could spend too much time staring at Naomi Watts in closeup, but there ya have it.<br /><br />The film does have a fairly lengthy opening section, but I was always passably amused.  It spends most of this time introducing us to a lot a deliberately cliched characters and a sorta intentionally dated either excessively whimsical or ominous tone.  I certainly can understand why some people would be bored with this portion of the film.  In fact, it's seems like I should've been, but I wasn't, so whatever.  But seriously, people need to get over this.  The movie has got like 2 hours of action in it, so the longer wait has got a longer payoff.<br /><br />Once they actually get to Skull Island we are fairly quickly treated to some more or less endless action scenes, and they are generally quite spectacular.  The one exception is the big, silly dinosaur stampede, which is just too wackily improbable, and just doesn't look very good.  It is kinda amusing in it's stupidity, but that ain't worth too much  Many have complained about the frightening, demonic natives, but I think they work very well and are, well, frightening and demonic.  Accusations of racism are stupid-- These people aren't related to anyone in the real world, what with their not being any Skull Island.  And frankly, I think you'd be pretty crazy and upset if you lived on an island filled with monsters, regardless of your race. But, on the other hand, maybe the critics are right.  Maybe they  shoulda had the nutty natives be a bunch've white men in business suit.  Thatta really made ya think.<br /><br />After Skull Island things are perhaps drawn out a little too much.  We don't really learn anything new in the delay between the major action scenes, and it would flow better if Jackson had tightened things up a bit.  Still, once Kong gets back to smashing stuff it's pretty sweet.  The finale is also pretty well done, though I think it's a bit excessively operatic.  Again, this goes back to the whole overly drawn out Kong-Ann angle, and we can only stand to see Ann being sad that Kong is going to die for so long before it gets a little tiresome.<br /><br />The acting is generally pretty stylized, so it isn't really good by modern standards, but it does fit the mood of the film.  Many have complained about Jack Black's performance, and while I hate Jack Black I think he's getting a bit too bad of a rap here.  Yes, he can't really handle the more dramatic scenes so well, and I definitely wearied of looking at his fat face, but he's fine in the lighter parts of his performance. (Which, of course, makes up the vast majority of his role.)  Watts is good enough as Ann, making her affection for Kong more plausible than one might've anticipated.  Brody is a little dull as Jack, but he doesn't have much of a role, frankly.  No one else stands out too much other than Thomas Kretschmann as the ultra surly, eastern european boat captain with a heart of gold.  What can I say, I like that guy.<br /><br />I guess that's it.  This is a just a big, fun, silly movie, albeit with some heart.  About as good as this kinda thing gets.  File alongside `The Mummy' and `Pirates of the Caribbean'.<br /><br />Grade: B+/A- Can't decideland things are perhaps drawn out a little too much.

B000683VI4|5.0|The Notebook, is a beautiful romance, set in South Carolina. The story is narrated by an elderly man, who is reading to an elderly woman with alzheimer's.<br /><br />To begin with the artistic filming is breath taking. Each shot is more beautiful then the last. Every shot seems like an artwork waiting to be painted. The smooth transitions, use of color schemes, and leit motif, all add an amazing sense of warmth and love.<br /><br />The story is nothing short of amazing. Though it does fall into some hackneyed moments, by the end of the film no eye is spared from tears. Tears of Joy.<br /><br />This film fills the emotions with warmth and joy and a feeling that can only be described as \\"floaty\\" I love this film.<br /><br />The acting excels beautifully. Rachel McAdams, who plays Allie the leading lady, breaks out of any shell of a stereotype Mean Girls tried to capture her in. She enraptures audiences in her feelings, charisma, and spontaneity.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling, who plays Noah, forces the audience to feel his heartbreak and love as it progresses through the movie.<br /><br />I give this movie an A++ and I pray that Hollywood begins to make more terrific pictures such as this.<br /><br />I also pray that I start meeting Men like Noah ( ha ha)
0789723107|5.0|This is the web usability book that's easy to use. Steve Krug makes a potentially dull subject like web usability, ridiculously funny and interesting. The book got me excited to go out and find people to test our sites. This is actually a book that was hard to put down.
B000002P2W|5.0|Connect the dots and you'll find that this is easily The Who's greatest work. The lyrics, the drumming, guitaring, bass, even Pete Townshend's vocals don't ruin this album - they make it better. Roger Daltrey does his part, as well, delivering roaring vocals that really express Pete Townshend's lyrics. The opener, \\"Slip Kid\\", shows this all, starting off with some good drumming, a count in and then it explodes, and it's all pure Who for the rest of the album. The second track, \\"However Much I Booze\\", is one of my favorites on the album simpy because this is pure Pete. He does the vocals, it's him singing about... himself. Not his generation, not a character, it's him. Thats what makes this song and album great. <br /> <br />Song three is \\"Squeeze Box\\", the hit song off the album. It's Pete trying to make a song that takes us back to earlier Who, yet it's a perfect example of the 'new Who', what they've become since songs like \\"Happy Jack\\". The song is one of those Pete Townshend hidden \\"sex songs\\", and it's brilliant. A good song from the album and very catchy on the radio. <br /> <br />After all the banjo soloing comes song four, \\"Dreaming from the Waist\\", originally titled \\"Control Myself\\". This is another favorite from the album, right from the cymbals crashing in to the bass doing insane-only-John-Entwistle bass on the fad out. The lyrics are top notch and it's one of Daltrey's best vocals. <br /> <br />Next up to bat is \\"Imagine A Man\\". This song sounds like an outtake from the Tommy sessions, with the spacy guitar and Daltrey's very high vocals. This is another great song for lyrics, one of Townshend's best. This one took me some time to like, but when I listened to it on my headphones, it shocked me how great the song was. <br /> <br />Next song is great, it's the only Entwistle written song on the album, and it's called \\"Success Story\\" about him in the Who before Tommy and how long it took for them to get rich. Very explosive from \\"Imagine A Man\\", and that'snot bad, Entwistle's lyrics are always fun. But it also shows the pressure at the time; \\"Take two hundred and seventy six? You know this used to be fun...\\" <br /> <br />Then it's time for \\"They're All In Love\\", a very head swaying lighter moving song. I don't really like Daltrey's vocals, but the backing vocals on the chorus make up for it, as well as the lyrics. Then the secon verse saves the song when Daltrey gets a little more umph. Then a ukelele starts playing as the song fades and it melts into another track... <br /> <br />...\\"Blue, Red and Grey\\". My favorite song on the album, because it's so calming, the brass is so beautiful and Townshend's vocals really show what he could do here. Having Daltrey sing this would have ruined the whole album for me. This is my personal favorite Who lyrical song, also. A very nice track. <br /> <br />Then we break into guitars again on \\"How Many Friends\\", another very cool track with tearing vocals and awesome drumming (which \\"Blue, Red and Grey\\" lacked, which is fine with me) about people who say they're your friend, but deep down they just want your money, your fame. Lovely song, as well. I really like this one because of the lyrics, I can imagine it all happening. <br /> <br />Now we go to the last track, a song called \\"In A Hand Or A Face\\". This one reminds me of sitting in a studio watching The Who talk about people and things they've seen on their way to where they are now. Very dark and very awesome choice for a closer. <br /> <br />The Who By Numbers is an all around nicely made album, no song is filler and even the cover art by Entwistle is great. I'd give this 10/5 if I could, any Who fan should enjoy it, and if you like just classic rock, it's a great buy.
B000AYEIZY|2.0|I have to admit that I have had an unnatural attraction for Cream's busy, jittery and bombastic blues improvisations for decades, as they've been a source of pleasure since I saw them first and three time total at Detroit's Grande Ballroom in the late Sixties. Euphoric recall? Maybe, but I still play the thirteen minutes of \\"Spoonful\\" from Wheels of Fire a couple of times a  year, and the sheer mania of Goodbye's \\"I'm So Glad\\" gets played just as often.<br /><br />The riffs, interweaving and interjections of the three musicians holding the stage  was a busy sort of vibe that was somewhere between musical worlds--too fast and loud for blues, too repetitive and unmelodious for jazz, too arty for rock and roll. It was a sound from the the nascent electronic wilderness that was a new kind improvisational sound, influenced by the three aforementioned styles (with occasional garnishes from Classical or English music all  traditions), but coming in the end as a new sort of strident , crackling noise; metallic, assertive, all conquering, sometimes searing when guitarist Eric Clapton was in the mood and made each of his blues intonations speak volumes of what his own voice could not manage.<br /><br />It is something that has less to do with sheer mastery of their respective instruments--in a heartbeat I could name a dozen musicians who are better guitarists, bassists and drummers than Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker--but with how the three of these guys gibed and gelled, how well their busy techniques meshed.\\"Meshed\\" might not be the right word, but what it gets called , Cream's sound was a wonderful clash of distortion and blue notes, a feedback laden trio of howling wolves. There is less of that shamanistic howl in the reunion double CD set Royal Albert Hall May 2-3-5-6 2005 ,  which is understandable given that all three members--Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton on drums, bass and guitar respectively--are in their Sixties. It wouldn't be incorrect to say that there are enough rousing performances here of old Cream and blues standards to fill one excellent live disc. Still, this is better than any expectation I've had over the last four decades daydreaming in off hours about a make believe reunion; the performances are solid for the most part, and I'm glad that Cream's essential duty as performers is to stand there and play their instruments. Unlike the Rolling Stones, whose rebel youth glory days have given way to a routinely graceless stage presence that would make a newcomer to their music wonder what the big deal ever was about these guys, Cream have only to instrumentalize, extemporize, improvise.<br /><br />Again, you wish there was only one disc, as some of the material suffers from obvious nerves, miscues, a lack of direction. There are moments when Clapton's guitar work simply quits in the middle of an idea, with the rhythm section  failing to pick it up again and fill the arena with the sort of muscular blues Cream made it's reputation. The best performances, in fact, are the blues number, especially  Albert King's \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" and \\"Stormy Monday\\", wherein Clapton vexes self-anointed blues traditionalists yet again with some guitar work that  transcends income, nationality, or skin color. It's not a conspiracy against the blues that B.B.King and Buddy Guy have no hesitation saying wonderful things about his playing. The muse is something that moves around and is not at all loyal to matters of class, race or political stance, and in this case the essence of what allows blues music to convince  you , at least momentarily, of the universality of a nuanced sort of suffering has taken a home in the center of Clapton's best fretwork.  His own solo work in the days since Cream's demise in the late Sixties has been largely wretched pop variations on roots music--please note that Layla is the very notable exception-- but however mediocre a songwriter he has become , his touch on the blues is the  touchof a master.<br /><br /> \\"It's all in the wrist\\" said Frankie Machine, the junkie in Nelson Algren's masterpiece The Man With The Golden Arm as he tries to describe the sort of body finesse it takes to win at throwing dice. It's all in the wrist with Clapton as well, and the fingers as he awards us with one ghostly tremolo and one screaming ostinato after another, the approximation of the human voice emerging from the din of electronic straining.

0743454529|4.0|I will not give away any spoilers in this review.  I read this book over the summer. It was very well written and I liked how Picoult developed the characters. I kept thinking how I would have responded if this were my family. I know I wouldn't have taken the same route as the mother did and some of the things she did made me a little angry.  At a birthday party, I was talking to my mother-in-law, and she also read this book. She started crying b/c her son had survived cancer and this book brought back a lot of painful memories for her...like the problems with insurance...his battles...etc.  I read this book by the pool and remember crying at a few pages...it was a real tear jerker.  We both had the same reactions to the ending and found it rather odd. I did see it coming where she did not.   We both loved this book, even though some of it was rather \\"strange\\" and I look forward to reading another of Picoult's novels soon.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First off, I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but I am a fan of a good story.  Secondly, I was never a fan of Whedon's until I saw the Firefly short-lived series in its entirety.  My husband convinced me to go see Serenity when the movie came out.  I was reluctant, but went anyway, and fell in love with the characters and story immediately.  I must say that I'm glad I saw the movie first, as I wasn't as emotionally involved with the characters until after viewing the tv series (therefore, some losses did not hit me as hard!).  Went out to pick up the DVD set after seeing Serenity.  After viewing the complete first season, I am convinced that television executives are clueless when making cancellation decisions.  To cancel a show like this, and keep some of the other crap shows alive is beyond me. <br /> <br />The series was smartly written, characters were multi-dimensional, no cheesiness, no corniness, none of the \\"what were they thinking\\" moments.  Plots were fun, lots of action crammed in, special effects were top notch in terms of television limitations, and perfect timing on injecting humorous moments and/or comments.  The actors were perfectly cast in their character roles, and you could tell they loved their roles, unlike other shows where the actors phone in their lines.  If you love westerns with an international flair, sci fi, great acting, great plots, comedy, and drama rolled into one, I highly recommend this dvd set.  But, keep in mind, when watching the dvds, it's like Lay's potato chips, you can't just watch one - you'll go through all four dvds in one day. <br /> <br />Side note - if there is a drive to resurrect the series, sign me up!
B000BO0LKY|1.0|This re-release does not offer enogh bonus material to make fans buy it again. <br />This is an amazing album, but the new edition is not worth the money. <br />If you already have the album, avoid this re-release.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|What is it with all these reviews mentioning Mariah Carey?  Do you realize that these are reviews for a MADONNA album?  Who cares how much Mariah or anyone else has sold?  You completely miss the point.  If you want to argue about who's better, go find a message board. Next time you're filling the text field with junk, glance up at the words \\"Please be sure to focus your comments on the product\\" on the form page. <br /> <br />Now, that being said...I like this album.  It feels as if it's an inside look at Madonna before we knew her, when dancing was a bigger part of her life.  It isn't solely disco; I'd say it was giving techno a disco *feel*, making it more mainstream.  <br /> <br />\\"Hung Up\\" (now that I know which song was sampled - it was really bugging me!) will probably always be my favorite.   <br /> <br />I like \\"Issac\\", even though I may not understand the controversy surrounding it. This is one of the times we shouldn't assume that Madonna just loves to find new ways to tick people off and is doing it again here. I think you're reading more into the song than is actually there.  <br /> <br />\\"Like it Or Not\\" really does sum up the damned if you do, damned if you don't situation Madonna has always been in.  When her songs are political or sensual, people complain.  Now people are complaining these lyrics are too simple and corny.  It makes me wonder if this song was added onto the end of the album deliberately.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I absolutly loved this movie. The action and special effects are so spectacular that I almost forgot I was watching I movie. I laughed, I cried, and couldn't close my mouth for the entire movie. Add the brilliant soundtrack and once again Peter Jackson has a spectacular hit on his hands. Now I haven't seen the 1933 version yet but I can bet you, you've never seen KIng Kong like this. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
1573301183|5.0|I have only been a fan of AIC/grunge music for about a year (I'm sorry I missed it's youth but I was still hung up on classic rock at the time being forty-____.) but I am now a firm fan of grunge and especially of AIC. Rarely will you ever see such gut wrenching emotion in music and emotion is what I love. If you want to just plug in something and let it be wallpaper don't bother with AIC. If, on the other hand, you want to plug something in and be riveted by the sheer power, professionalism, and musical prowess try AIC.  <br /> <br />Few things AIC have ever done demonstrate this better than \\"Unplugged.\\" Rarely do you see a group perform studio recordings as near flawless as does AIC. The repeoduction is almost exactly the same as you would hear if you listened to a studio recording cd, with the exception of course that they are using acoustic guitars instead of electric. The tempi is as near exact as the ear could detect unless of course one is a music expert. I find that many bands play their songs either slightly or quite noticeably faster live that they are on their records. Not AIC as far as I can tell. The acoustic instruments take nothing away from the power of AIC's music either. In fact, the subtleness may even add to the emotion of the songs. It's like someone whispering, it may not be as loud but it gets your attention more that if they yelled. <br /> <br />I was totally parylized by this performance when I first saw it. I could not take my eyes off of Layne when he was on screen. Rarely do you find a performer who can elicit such feeling by just the sound of his voice alone. Of course his tortured persona adds to this but I'm sure I would be just as captured by him if I were listinging to the \\"Unplugged\\" cd rather than watching the dvd. <br /> <br />I think the three songs that best demonstrate this are \\"Nutshell\\", \\"Down In A Hole\\", and \\"Rooster.\\" Astounding! I firmly agree with an earlier reviewer who said you don't have to be an AIC fan to enjoy thisdvd. All you have to be is a lover of good rock music and if you are also a lover of good rock music performed really well live you will be richly rewarded by this dvd. <br /> <br />P.S. Sean Kinney is indeed a fantastically gifted drummer. He knows that drumming is about timing rather than noise and he an Mike Inez are like the siamese twins of rhythm sections. Watch, listen and marvel.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Shakira - Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 <br /> <br /> <br />I have been a fan of Shakira since I first heard \\"Si Te Vas\\" and fell in love with the CD Donde Estan Los Ladrones.  Her Spanish-language recordings exhibit such fire and raw emotion that transcends the language barrier. <br /> <br />In early 2005, Shakira released Fijacion Oral Vol. 1and \\"La Tortura\\" (featuring Alejandro Sanz) was a huge international hit.  I was expecting some of the passion on volume 2.   <br /> <br />The problem is that on her Spanish-language recordings, Shakira exhibits such heart and drive and solidifies each number with a bout of confidence.  At best, Shakira is shaky on her English-language recordings.  Any fan of her entire catalog will agree; Shakira lacks the same intimacy when singing in English. <br /> <br />Now that I have put this disclaimer aside, there are a few songs worthy of consideration. <br /> <br />First single, \\"Don't Bother,\\" has taken a rough road to the charts.  Radio is not playing like they had \\"La Tortura\\" and her English-language hits from Laundry Service.  Albeit a departure for Shakira, give the track additional spins and it will soon become a favorite. <br /> <br />My favorite song from Oral Fixation Vol. 2 is \\"How Do You Do\\".  This is by far one of Shakira's most introspective songs to date.  I find it totally intriguing and hope that this is chosen as a radio single. <br /> <br />I suppose any contemporary Latin crossover CD would not be complete without the touch of Mr. Carlos Santana.  No need to worry, Shakira has harnessed his guitar riffs for \\"Illegal\\".   <br /> <br />I also enjoy that track, \\"Something\\".  I imagine that most agree that there is something intriguing about hearing Shakira speak a foreign tongue; even if this time it is a brief introduction in French.  This song definitely captures an international flavor which makes it appealing to me. <br /> <br />\\"Timor\\" is an excellent choice to close Oral Fixation Vol. 2.  This song exudes a retro-feelwith a vibrant dance beat and a rock edge.  DJ's would be wise to remix and spin in clubs.    <br />
B000002UAO|5.0|I am now channeling Amazon.com  Are you ready?<br /><br />  Was this review helpful to you?---<br /><br />  ---- yes  --- no<br /><br />Are you kidding me? If they had a 6 star rating I would do that. As I have said before things started to change after this album. The Beatles set the bar higher and all the groups I've written about responded in kind. (Read Metamorpho's other reviews. Become delighted-enlightened!).<br /><br />  I remember going to Hackensack, as a young chile, and this album was out and I had to be REDUCED to buying an open copy! It didn't matter - it was SUPERB! The ever wonderful Beatles were examining new directions. And this was just more DIFFERENT than the Help! l.p. - but in a much better way. Oh! The things that came out of this music! Friends of mine were trying to learn french because of Paul McCartney's 'Michelle', and people caught on to John Lennon's play on words, Norwegian Wood for \\"Knowing She Would\\", and I, Metamorpho, found myself singing as I walked through a graveyard, \\"I'd rather see you dead little girl, than to be with another man.\\" How can one disregard the total impact of this album?<br /><br />  It is there for the ages. And, anyone who knows the Beatles will always have their own memories to deal with and cherish.  I only feel sorry for anyone who didn't grow up with it. That they didn't feel the full impact upon it's release. But, as in all great music, it is preserved for all who come later to take into their world the way they want to.  The Beatles discovered \\"music\\" on this album, not just \\"rock music\\".<br /><br />And this, dear people, are what legacies are made of. Wonderful....fresh....sounding actually BETTER today than it did back then. Decades and time will not dampen this masterpiece! A glory now - and a glory then - and a glory for coming ages. One of the 'Best' from the 'Best'. Indulge and glory in this! With \\"say the word\\" Love- to all. Metamorpho.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Greenday from 1039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours to now have had a great journey. This is by far a different formula of music for Green Day, I would like to say this is alot different than dookie. Is it better? In some parts yes, in other no. Are their chorus's still catchy? YES. Guitars Still Rocking? YES Same Emotion put in to the album? YES, plus much much more. This cd is more alternative/rock than dookie which is more punkish. This cd has alot to offer, it may not be as crazy or wild as dookie, but you see this isn't just songs that you can relate to, they are songs that tell a story, they tell you a GREAT story at that. This is a \\"Rock Opera\\". This is something never done before, it will change the way we look at music forever, just like Dookie did. It is diffrent, but does it have the same effect as Dookie? Yes, it got people hooked on Green Day, It even helped Dookie sell at least 1 million more copies, because it helped people re-discover the band we know as green day. This album is a masterpiece. . .    American Idiot-10/10 Great Opener full of energy and it shows Green Day taking on Politics    Jesus Of Surburbia-10/10 A 9 Minute Masterpiece, from the opening lyric: \\"Im the son of rage and love, The Jesus of Surburbia\\" you know this is going to be one of the best tracks on the cd. This song has so many different genre's all packed into one emotionaly powerful song    Holiday-10/10, as Billie Joe says, \\"This song is not Anti-American . . .it's Anti-WARRRRRRRRRRRR\\" A catchy chrous will have you singing along in no time and it does the perfect fadeout  of holiday and into. . .    Boluvard of Broken Dreams-10/10, First i'd like to say YES it is overplayed. But, why is it overplayed because it is such a great song, thats why    Are We The Waiting-10/10 Starts out with the drums and the guitars come in so perfectly . . .a great slowish song    St. Jimmy-10/10 Old Green Day fans rejoyce this has the same exciting speed and punk guitar playin as dookie and 1039, a great song, its the fastest song on the cd    Give Me Novacaine- 10/10 Once again starting out with drums and then in comes an acoustic guitar, great song, with a catchy chrous    Shes A Rebel-10/10 Punk Green Day again, fast paced and energetic song, with a great line, \\"Shes holding on to my heart like a hand grenade\\"    Extraordinary Girl-10/10 It starts out with indian/folk like music and then explodes into a fast paced rock extraveganza    Letterbomb-10/10 \\"Nobody likes you, Everyone Left You, They're all out with out you having fun\\" BOOM Guitars come in and seconds later so do the drums a great paced song with a good beat    Wake Me Up When September Ends 10/10- Time Of Your Life? Don't you mean Wake Me Up When September Ends, my fav track on the cd, This is time of your life, for the new generation . . a song filled with so much emotion, you can't help but shed a tear, great emotionly powerful song, starts only soft then boom the drums come in so perfectly its like your in heaven. . .    Homecomming- 10/10 Another 9 minute masterpiece. Great song it has alot of the chorus's from the other songs on the album, great great song    Whatsername- 10/10 Another Drums into Guitar beginning, great finishing to a great album, it reminds me of Macys Day Parade because of the tempo . . .great great song
B00006AW2L|5.0|People.  One must read between the lines, or the buttons, so to squawk. Let's not quibble on this one, o.k?  I am just beginning to come out of my New Year's comatose state.  So.........let's see.<br /><br />  This is a wonderful c.d. Got it when it first came out on L.P. back in the changing 60's, and I was always impressed with the sound quality on it. Crisp, clear, every instrument coming out to greet you done in that inimitable 60's style stereo. Who could ask for more? And the diversity of the tunes! As the Beatles did with Rubber Soul, the Stones were onto the same track with this album. They went beyond popular artists to becoming recording artists. You may think they're the same - they're not. There is some real thought here on sound and song construction.  A conscious effort. And it shows.<br /><br />  All the songs are unique and take on their own particular life. I think I'm at King Arthur's court while listening to \\"Lady Jane\\" and \\"I am Waiting\\". What is Brian playing? A dulcimer? I am at some country front porch while listening to \\"High and Dry\\" and flying into Newark Airport as \\"Going Home\\" comes across the headphones. As I said - diverse. And there is much creativity here, and in your mind, to keep you satisfied. And, unlike Mick, you can get some satisfaction here. Try creating your own scenarios as you listen.<br /><br />  I won't get into archival notes here. Too much work and others have done this for you in other reviews. I operate more on the emotional level. How the songs group, the underlying effect of the whole experience - the feeling upon listening. To me, that is the important thing. The great discovery in this recording is that the old adages disappeared.  You didn't have to rock hard anymore. Rocking soft was another trail. And everything in between.  The Stones got that key early. All songs very listenable - and the Stones are creating their own style of blues.  Highly recommended!
0316172324|5.0|In education, standardized tests have become a way of life.  As a student, I happened to be very good at these types of multiple-choice tests.  One reason I was good at these tests was that I realized something early on:  my first instinct was almost always right.  The few times I thought over an answer and decided to change it, I nearly always changed the right answer into a wrong one.<br /><br />This experience came to me as I was reading Malcolm Gladwell's book, Blink.  Essentially, this is a book about making snap judgements.  As Mr. Gladwell points out, all of us are constantly making choices \\"in the blink of an eye.\\"  The question is, why are some people better at making these kind of snap judgements than others?<br /><br />The answer, as Mr. Gladwell describes it, seems to be:  preparation.  All of us make our judgements based on our experience--experience that becomes so ingrained that we can become ultimately unaware of why we know what we know.  I was a rigorous student, so I was prepared to make the right judgement on tests and I learned to trust that judgement.  In his book, Mr. Gladwell describes a number of interesting instances of this: art critics who can instantly recognize fakes, tennis coaches who can predict a double fault before the serve is complete, the counselor who can tell which marriages will fail from listening to a couple converse with each other.  He then goes on to describe research that can pick apart these situations and help us understand what in these persons' experience has given them these abilities.<br /><br />But Mr. Gladwell is also aware that snap judgements can lead us into error.  In Blink, he looks at some great failures of judgement like the Diallo shooting, the election of Warren G. Harding as U.S. President and the introduction of New Coke.  What seems to set these events apart is that, whereas in the successful examples the judgements are made by individual experts in narrow fields,  in the failures the settings are social ones where the decisions are made by groups.  In these groups, cultural influences have colored our experiences and often in a negative, albeit unconsciously negative, way.  The subtle associations of African-Americans with crime and charisma with success can lead us down the wrong paths in ways we may not even expect.<br /><br />How, then, to successfully \\"thin-slice,\\" as Mr. Gladwell calls it?  Awareness.  Once we become aware of our prejudices, we can mold our minds and sharpen our experiences.  Then we will be better prepared to make choices.  In this powerful book full of excellent examples and descriptions of current research, Mr. Gladwell has provided a step to that awareness.  It is well worth reading.are social ones where the decisions are made by groups.

B0000025D0|5.0|Being a manic-depressive, Metamorpho has extremely keen senses into the sheer depth of songwriting. There were only 2 albums in the 70's that were of high, asylum quality. One was Jackson Brownes' \\"Late for the Sky\\" and the other was this gem. Love Bruce. He's from my home state and has the ability to write poetry and relate the struggle of the common man as well. But, in this one folks, he goes way deep.  It cuts very deep.  And I found myself in a puddle of tears many times as I listened and clawed at my own soul and being to make sense of this world.<br />  All of the rest of his efforts are great achievements and many are worthy of high praise.  For me, though, 'Darkness' is THE MASTERPIECE! It's all a struggle. A struggle for redemption, for meaning, for elevation onto a better plain. Bruce doesn't mince words. Reality is what it is. The pain, hurt and depression are always there. We all must find a way to rise above it all and go on.<br />  It's about the human need to redeem oneself. As in 'Racing in the Street' - \\"tonight my baby and me are going to run to the sea, to wash these sins off our hands.\\" It's about faith. As in 'The Promised Land' - \\"there's a twister that will tear everything down, that ain't got the faith to hold it's ground.\\"<br />But he will survive. He'll be out beyond 'the darkness on the edge of town'.<br />  Bruce is very much a considerable song writer. He uses the sea in the classic English prose interpretation - as the flow of life, as a clensing.  His talent extends well beyond the ordinary.  Whether people really \\"get\\" all that he writes about is up to speculation. But, take it from me, Metamorpho, your favorite reflective seer, there is positively nothing shallow about Bruce Springsteen.  For those that can delve into their soul - this album is a must.  Yes---- we know that it isn't always pleasant - but how are you ever going to grow spiritually if you don't take the chance?  Methinks, one of his very best.  Trust Metamorpho.

B0007Y08QA|5.0|Christian Bale (Batman Begins) shines in this small underrated gem about a factory worker named Trevor Reznik who is suffering from severe paranoia and a serious case of insomnia and weight loss.     He hasn't slept in a year, and his health is not great- he's losing weight at an alarming rate. And worst of all, he encounters things and people, creepy as they may be especially his co-worker Ivan, that seemingly exist only in his head (or do they?).     The only people he can turn to for a little bit of comfort are Stevie, his next door prostitute neighbor and occasional lover, and Marie, a waitress at an airport snack bar.    You will feel hypnotized and entrapped as you follow Trevor in his demonic nightmare trying to figure out what all the sticky notes are about, who all these people are that he is encountering, and whether or not they are plotting against him and why. I will stop right here because the movie holds many secrets and surprises along the way.    What keeps the movie highly interesting is Bale's incredible performance -he actually shed 63 pounds to play the role, something that will make such sophisticated charactor actors as Robert De Niro jealous!    Overall, The Machinist is an extraordinary film that will keep your eyes glued to the screen, and keep you on the edge of your seat.    A top notch psychological thriller!    Recommended    A-
B0000025RI|5.0|Metamorpho just stopped in from his planet to peruse the current state of affairs of one Michael Jackson.  I can't believe it. He may or may not be ill. Depending on which side of the jury box you sit on - but be real! Many of you walk around like robots with no feeling or compassion. Is this what the world is made up of now? Ugh! And.....so willing to pass judgement when you really don't know anything. Really. Time to stretch those humanistic brain cells for a change - laying dormant for such a long time as far as I can see!<br /><br />  'Thriller' is a classic. Back in the early 80's, like EVERYONE was playing this album.  Everyone had it(as the sales will testify to). Parents were playing it as lullabyes for their children. People - this was MEGA!<br /><br />  I have come here not to bash Michael Jackson. I still say that, no matter what, you cannot lessen achievement simply because the artist may appear no longer in vogue...or controversial.  Michael Jackson never KILLED anyone, and, as I may point out so succinctly, Governments have! If you think what he may or may not have done is more monstrous than ordering people to die in combat than you all need a serious mental make-over.<br /><br />  That said, 'Thriller' is a thriller and a gem of an album. It was listenable, had great beats, and utilized just fantastic production (and the use of Vincent Price) to create memorable landscapes and scenarios.  Need I relate all the tunes? Forget that. The guides tell Metamorpho that you know them all to well.<br /><br />  This album  is a testament to good pop. It is a pleasure. The press (which is an ABOMINATION in this country), close-minded judgemental cretins and just negative people, stay away!<br /><br />We don't need you and can appreciate artistic achievement on it's own merits! Thank-you. Always willing to please- yours, Metamorpho!
B0007OCG4W|4.0|\\"Closer\\" is a film about four people and the role that truth (or different kinds of truth) plays in their relationships as they try to get closer to themselves and to each other. The mixed reaction from viewers is because while \\"Closer\\" is a nicely packaged film and a fast-paced intelligent screenplay; the four main characters are \\"extremes\\" or at least extreme examples of the behaviors at the allegorical core of the film. These \\"expressionistically\\" drawn characters offend and disappoint the viewer segment expecting realistic and sympathetic portrayals (insert \\"characters with whom they can identify\\" here).<br /><br />But they are extreme because they are intended to illustrate (in obvious ways) certain subtle elements of our romantic relationships. The two male characters, Dan (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen), are products of and participants in the most fundamental Darwinian courtship process. Despite making a pretense of having evolved from the competitive courtship of male primates, they are still driven more by the need to win and secure a trophy than by a quest to love. Likewise Anna, the older female (Julia Roberts), is attracted by the male demonstrations of dominance, both the physical bluster of strength and the mental head games intended to manipulate her emotions. Accordingly her behavior encourages these demonstrations by the males.<br /><br />Contrasted with these three is the younger female (Natalie Portman) who seeks a man who can transcend primitive drives, loving her and allowing her to love him.<br /><br />Into this mix writer Patrick Marber inserts the truth factor in an ironic way. Portman's character places little value on words, adopting a false name at the beginning of the film. That she is superficially living a lie is ironic because she is the only one of the four who does not lie about their true feelings or engage in self-deception. Her transparency and detached self-awareness is symbolized by her job as a stripper.<br /><br />The otherthree torture themselves and each other with superficial truths while engaging in compulsive deception about their actions and actual feelings, to each other and to themselves. Their duplicity is symbolized by their occupations. Dan is an obit writer, skilled in the use of euphemisms to disguise the unflattering characteristics of the deceased. Anna is a photographer, skilled in freezing a single moment in time uncharacteristic of the actual subject she is representing. Larry is a dermatologist focused on the superficial surface that one publicly presents.<br /><br />The key exchange occurs early in the film as Alice and Dan discuss how essential euphemisms are in his job:<br /><br />Alice: What would my euphemism be? Dan: She was... disarming. Alice: That's not a euphemism. Dan: Yes, it is.<br /><br />Alice's up-front and open behavior causes him to let down his guard and feel a higher level of emotion, but his need to make new conquests and to test his attractiveness soon reasserts itself. She is willing to forgive this until finally convinced that he cannot transcend something so much a part of his basic nature.  With this realization she falls out of love.<br /><br />\\"Closer\\" is much like \\"XX/XY\\" in its exploration of the mysteries of male discontent although it is philosophically deeper and much better written. Mark Ruffalo plays Coles (the Dan character in that film), but Law's portrayal is more convincing because he does not have to alternate between rebel and wimp, something that Ruffalo could not quite pull off.<br /><br />All four performances are solid although Roberts is given very little with which to work. Portman is especially good. The problem with \\"Closer\\" is that its symbolic message is not getting through to most viewers (at least it would appear so from the many clueless reviews and comments) who try to relate to it on a literal level. But if you like abstract tales deceptively showcased in a realistic package you should really enjoy this fine film.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
B0000AZAUM|5.0|Metamorpho is a space invader comin' to praise David Bowie - the ever omni-present changling.  Oh people. What can I tell you about this classic?  We had parties. Many, many parties way back when.  Oh the absurdity--the laughs - the incongruous incongruity! What fun.  Ziggy was on - one of the main essentials to the evening.  I admit - at first listening one is prompted to ask \\"What's this?\\" But, after awhile, does it even really matter?  Just go with the flow.  Bowie is so remarkable because he tried on many personas - some to shock - and some to catch you off guard.  And while your delicate synapses were busy being assaulted - you had this gnawing fear underneath that, perhaps, just perhaps, this music was just great innovative rock and maybe, just maybe, your dear ol' grandparents were wrong! (We won't get into Mom and Dad here.  My energy is not up to snuff at the moment).<br /><br />  As all great artists do, Bowie knocks down barriers between us all with music.  And, face it, sometimes music can do things that all the governments and religions on earth can't do - and that is, make us all get along.<br /><br />  The music is apocalyptic, ethereal space musings, Lady Stardust singing songs of darkness and disgrace.  We are treated to Bowie, as the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star!<br /><br />And.....the energy.  So great.  You know you want to groove with it all.  Go ahead. Nobody's watching.<br /><br />  And.......an added bonus.  Bowie had the good sense to have Mick Ronson along for the ride. What a guitar player! Ziggy, I am convinced, would not have been as strong without this incredible musician.  I miss you Mick. You were essential life-giving substance in my book.<br /><br />  People.  I am not good delving into seperate songs for albums.  I deal mostly on the emotional level. But if you like good ass-kicking rock and it playing very loud - this is a true classic in that genre.  Great tunes by a great artist. Rock on. Wishing all a great soul evolving New Year! Yours, Metamorphoevolving New Year! Yours, Metamorpho
0761129235|4.0|Because I have several criticisms of this book, I should say at the outset that I found it helpful and worth purchasing. Stripped to its essence, Dr. Maurer's program consists of taking a series of very small incremental steps towards self-improvement instead of taking on the entire project with one gulp. Good advice, and it works. While he engages in the typical doctor/author approach of telling little stories about his patients (Do doctors all go to the same \\"Famous Authors School?\\"), his stories are shorter and more to the point than those of others. Overall, I found the book to be helpful.<br /><br />Now for the criticisms:<br /><br />1. This is not a book about Kaizen, which is a collection of Japanese manufacturing techniques involving the elimination of waste, Just In Time delivery, production load leveling, standardized work, paced moving lines, and right-sized equipment. There is some small overlap with the program described by Dr. Maurer, but his is aimed at personal improvement and is much simpler.<br /><br />2. Like many doctor/authors, Dr. Maurer suugests that he has found the solution to all of the reader's problems, the key to the universe, rather than a simple, useful tool.<br /><br />3. The book is way too long. Fortunately, there are chapter summaries at the end of each chapter for those who prefer a quick read. An executive summary at the beginning of the book would be a welcome addition.<br /><br />Readers who would like to see how the same approach can be applied to business should consider [[ASIN:0070479046 The Mind Of The Strategist: The Art of Japanese Business]] by Konichi Ohmae, one of the few great business books.
0062502182|5.0|That is a line from Hafiz, and to me \\"The Alchemist\\" is a little life boat. Find inspiration in it and you can get to the other side. <br /> <br />The story is deceptively simple, and I suppose that people that come with big expectations for enlightenment are disappointed, but if one simply reads along, he/she will find a little treasure, a little inspiration to go a long way. What can be more simple than a boy-sheppard looking for a treasure? Then finding the treasure within. And let's not forget Fatima, for what is a fable without a little romance? <br /> <br />I bought \\"The Alchemist\\" along with another book it was advertised with, \\"Dream Maker:A Mystical Tale\\". (two books for a reduced price!) For those who complain that \\"The Alchemist\\" is not deep enough, try \\"Dream Maker:A Mystical Tale\\" It will make you think, for sure.

B000003GBN|5.0|This generous CD (79 min.) fuses two recording sessions devoted to Beethoven. The first, from 1955, produced the Fidelio Over. and Seventh Sym., the second the Coriolan Over. and Fifth Sym. In both sessions the Living Stereo sonics are world-class. Nothing more could be asked in terms of impact, fidelity, and depth of sound, particularly in the Coriolan, which jumps out of the speakers--it's firghteningly close to real.<br /><br />Reiner led thhe CSO for barely nine seasons, I believe, and yet he produced a wealth of great recordings. In this case the Coriolan Over. stands out as something exceptional. The combination of abandon and precision is astonishing; one hardly associates the meticulous Reiner with runaway passion, but here it is. The finale of the Seventh, indeed the whole of the Seventh, rises almost to this level and on its own is a performance to rival Carlos Kleiber's with the Vienna Phil. on DG, though Reiner is more exacting in ensemble and a touch less free in tempo. Some listeners may be disappointed that he suppresses the thrilling horn calls in the first movement, but that is a small blemish.<br /><br />The Fifth Sym. lacks the unsurpassed inner tension we've come to associate with the great performances by Toscanini and Carlos Kleiber, but if those readings didn't exist, Reiner's would be on a par with Karajan's 1963 reading for DG. The CSO plays better than the Berlin Phil. of that era, however, and the recorded sound is much clearer. I cannot describe any peculiar touches that Reiner adopts in either symphony; he was an objectivist but of the best kind, without the sacrifice of expressivity and drama. One is amazed throughout at the orchestra's ability to play with perfect intonation and balance no matter how loud or fast the music gets.<br /><br />I would wager that this is the best Beethoven recording ever made by an American orchestra, equalled only by Bernstein, who was Reiner's pupil, and even there the younger conductor is less impassioned than the older. Five stars without reservation.ssioned than the older. Five stars without reservation.
0451191153|4.0|Ayn Rand has been an interesting influence on me throughout. While I have never subscribed to her objectivist phiolosophy outright, I value her opinions about individualism and share her passion against anything remotely to do with Communism.    The following is, however, a spoof on her first major success: Fountainhead. Hoard Roark is the protaganist of this fictitious venture and epitomizes individualism. However, since I feel it's neither possible nor practical to live like him, I have come up with this little take-off on one of the meetings Hoard Roark has with his friend Peter Keating.    =======    Hoard Roark was sitting at his desk in his office. He was looking at the designplans for the new building he would be working on. \\"Would\\" is the operative word here because nobody has offered Hoard Roark any work in the last 3 months. He had to pay his landlord. He had to pay the Electric and Gas services. He had to pay and he had nothing to pay with.    Peter Keating made a sudden entrance into his office. Keating was famous for his sudden entrances. It gave him that extra power, that extra hold over his audiences. However, he realized that Hoard was never in awe of him. He would look at him with the same impassioned gaze he would employ when he watched grass grow. Peter Keating felt uncomfortable in Roark's presence. Roark seemed to look through him and Keating didn't like it at all. Who would?    \\"What do you think of,\\" Keating blurted out. Before he could complete his sentence, Roark cut him off mid-way. \\"If you are talking about anything that interests you, then I don't think of it. I only think of my work and myself all the time. By the way, I don't think of you either,\\" Roark said with that same impassioned gaze of his.    \\"I was going to say, `What do you think of the weather today.' But you cut me off,\\" Keating angrily said. \\"Oh, that! I don't care much about the weather,\\" replied Roark. Keating didn't know what else to say. Roark always did that to him.\\"What about other people? Don't you think of any one?\\" Keating asked Roark. He had to continue this conversation. He wanted to run away from there screaming, tearing his hair, back to his $300,000 dollar per year job, but he felt a strange urge to continue.    \\"I don't think of other people too. In fact, when I am walking on a street, I don't notice them,\\" Roark proclaimed. He wasn't sounding obnoxious. He was stating a mere fact. The conviction clearly shone through his eyes.    \\"Well, wouldn't that cause you to bump into them sometimes?\\" Keating asked incredulously. He could never understand Roark.    \\"It does,\\" admitted Roark. \\"But it's a small price to pay for preserving your individualism.\\"    Peter Keating changed the topic. \\"There is this girl I am in love with. I don't know how to say it to her,\\" he said.    \\"Peter, you must solve your own problems. If you don't know how to profess your love, then you're not fit to love,\\" said Roark amicably. Then he continued. \\"I will tell you what to do this time though. Find out when she sleeps. Find out if there is a window through which you can enter her bedroom. And then, get in and make love to her, forcibly if necessary.\\"    Keating was aghast. \\"But if she doesn't like me doing that, it would amount to rape. I would be arrested. Worse, I would lose my job.\\" The mere thought turned his stomach.\\"There is only one way to find out, Peter,\\" calmly said Hoard Roark. (Since this essay needs to end with the words \\"Hoard Roark.\\")

0553801503|3.0|The first three books in the Ice and Fire series were phenomenal. I could not put them down. I checked the GRRM website regularly to find out when A Feast for Crows would be released, something I do not do with other authors. Unfortunately, A Feast for Crows was a huge disappointment. It was tedious. And easy to put down.  <br /> <br />I agree with other reviewers that this smells like Jordan. The first 3-4 books in the Wheel of Time could not be put down, and then they dragged on forever. And ever.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, Martin is trying to maintain too many storylines, similar to Jordan. A Feast for Crows had about ten storylines. One difference is that whereas Jordan's last six books almost nothing happens, things still happened in A Feast for Crows. <br /> <br />The series started off very Stark-centric, with the Lannisters their main antagonists. The series has lost the Stark-centric focus, and this may be the largest problem. I know we are promised more Starks in Book 5, but that does not help Book 4. <br /> <br />Like others, I have liked the edgy feel of these books. But the edginess has deteriorated into raunchiness. To use a movie analogy, the first book was borderline between PG-13 and R rated. A Feast for Crows is borderline between R and X rated. I hope the raunchy direction does not continue. But I am afraid it will.

B00005JMUA|4.0|Without the extended dialogue sections between the various characters, which also act as useful exposition, this is is hardly the classic too much trumpeted. There is nothing one hasn&#8217;t seen many times before in other films. This is often something I have always thought of QT films, as if he simply took a bunch of movies, edited out sections, tied them together, and shot it all over again. Jackie Brown is his only original enough movie, which I think is his best, to date. <br /> <br />If a Directors cut were to happen, I think Kill Bill 1 & 2 should be made into one complete movie and some superfluous scenes removed. Apart form that, the overall style and chronological order of the construction is very well executed and the acting is of a high standard.    <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Overall, this movie is good, but not great. I was a huge huge fan of the series, having just finished the DVD collection. The first two episodes were incredibly well done.<br /><br />The movie picks up, sorta, from where the series left off. Watching with my wife, who hadn't see the series, she was a bit lost, while I was a bit bored.<br /><br />Some of the dialect was somewhat out of place, as they didn't seem to go fully into the tounge like they did in the series. There were random moments of alien and western dialect that seemed out of place when there was so little of it.<br /><br />The actors seemed to be playing the same characters as the series, but were older, and perhaps better actors - which made the acting seem ...odd.<br /><br />If you liked the series, the movie is worth a watch. Don't get too excited though!
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|Okay, I was fine waiting through October, and even through December when they moved back the date to January 10th of this year.  NOW after waiting over 2 years for this thing to come out, I learn I have to wait 4 more years to see it.  Square-Enix can kiss my @ss if they think I am going to wait that long.  Amazon should pull this item and refuse to sell it.  Tell Square to stop screwing with its customer base - I'll be boycotting a lot of their crap until they learn how to deliver in a reasonable time.  I mean, in 4 years?  They could shoot 20 movies in that time never mind just translate this one.  IDIOTS!

B00004R99U|4.0|I enjoyed Pocahontas 2: Journey to A New World. Although it got a lot of bad reviews, I thought it was worth adding to my Disney collection. You get most of the original characters (minus Mel Gibson as John Smith), and Judy Kuhn again sings beautifully in the movie (although the songs in part one are much better). I think a lot of people are disappointed with the ending, which historically is the path that Pocahontas does choose....I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Needless to say, it doesn't quite measure up to the original Pocahontas but I thought it was interesting to find out what happens to Pocahontas and John Smith. Younger children will absolutely love part 2 because the story involves Meeko, Flit and Percy quite a bit, and they are pretty quirky! I think my 3 year old probaby liked this movie better than the original for that reason. I liked this movie, but I LOVED the original!
B0000C8AW2|5.0|Truth be told that this album is a good one, musically it is glossy and slick adding horns with an allmost Phil Spector sound at your face but the songs are good something new and still steeped in the blues,when it 1st came out people said it was Dylan's \\"Las Vegas\\" album...just look at the back cover shot of Dylan/Elvis..He was castigated for turning electric, now he was considered a sort of middle of the road who knows what...<br />That is exactly the point of street legal,anything goes down on the street..everything goes..till one day it all becomes a felt rehash. These are good,gospel,blues tinged songs with an added touch of Mexican and Jazz horns with some violin and mandolin thrown in for good measure..This high production value threw many of his purists a loop.<br />Yet,there is a seed of truth here that found expression.The great Mexican sounding song \\"No Time To Think\\" hits it on the head..after the excess, the partying,the vegas gloss, veneer,existential turmoil comes \\"No Direction Home\\" The Band cut a song \\"where Do We Go From Here\\"...Dylan went into Slow Train Coming,his next album.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I never had an interest in watching this movie. It wasn't until I heard \\"Colors of the Wind\\" on the Disney Princess Collection CD that I decided to watch it with my three year old. My daughter enjoyed the movie, but I loved it even more. The music is beautiful, and Judy Kuhn's voice is amazing. Mel Gibson also sings a song with Kuhn, \\"If I Never Knew You\\" and I thought his voice was pretty amazing too. This movie strays from some of the historical facts/legends of the real Pocahontas, but who cares. Most of us would probably be bored and depressed if the true story of Pocahontas was told in this movie. This is a beautiful love story of two people from two-different worlds who meet under unfortunate circumstances. And the ending isn't predictable like all the other Disney happily-ever-after movies which makes this movie even more heart-felt and intriguing.  I also felt Disney did a wonderful job in sending a message to our children about respecting the land that we have been blessed with. Although some see the portrayal of the greedy settlers as racism (which really it was only one governor in the story who was greedy), I saw it as a lesson for us not to take nature and our surroundings for granted.<br /><br />The animals in the movie were cute and entertaining for the youngsters; but the story itself is for adults and was beautifully told in a Disney kind-of-magical-way.<br /><br />And for those who are thinking of buying Pocahontas 2: Journey to A New World...

B0000C8AVI|5.0|What a great musically sounding album..great musicians and production,great guitar playing from Dire Straits Mark Knopfler, On keyboards, Barry Beckett even the great Muscle Shoals Horns.<br />Well, what started as an odyssey on Street Legal became a need for consolation and this temporary abode stretched into 3 albums..This one being the best.<br />Whereas Saved and Shot Of Love have their good raw passionate wild moments,this first of this trilogy was the mature observant Dylan, not exactly Modern Orthodox as some character out of \\"Jewtopia\\" the theatre show, but a somewhat \\"when you ain't got nothing,you got nothing to loose\\" Dylan groping for meaning..<br />Well Muddy Waters had a song \\"You Can't Lose What You Never Had\\" (later covered by The Allman Brothers) I think Dylan found that out...his humanism never left nor his traditional Jewish roots, these things can never be lost.<br />Like a monkey on a tether, no matter how far the monkey strays out,the rope is never cut,he will get yanked back..<br />The songs speak for themselves,the music is stellar.
0375507256|5.0|I'm an English teacher who doesn't read enough, although I've enjoyed teaching \\" Cuckoo's Nest\\" and \\"Bell-Jar\\" to my lovely A-level students this term. Normally it's the same five pages in bed and zzzzzzzz but here with a big cold in my head and a birthday book in my hand I've been ABSOLUTELY GRIPPED by this one and finished it in five days which breaks my world record. Which reviewer said this wasn't a WOW? This novel reinforces your belief in the human spirit. It's as simple as that. Thank you, David Mitchell; now for your others.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|The \\"shift key\\" solution is a great one.  Don't miss this disc or any other artists tracks due the corporate vultures.  Don't boycot the Foo Fighters, just work around the Sony tricksters.  Foo Fighters are a real bright spot on the music scene, and no I was not ever a Nirvana fan... <br /> <br />After spending about twenty year as a musician and in the music industry it is extraordinary to see the ridiculous steps Sony and other major labels have taken to eliminate piracy.  How about putting out better product, and price it so that consumers will buy it. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, piracy really does cost millions but the truth is that artists make money off touring and not as much on the sales of music.  This is where the corporate suits that control the music industry come in.  So if you like the music, buy a concert ticket and support the artist. <br /> <br />The labels spent years promoting \\"music\\" and \\"artists\\" that had the shelf life of a carton of milk just to get a quick hit and the A&R guys simply did not develop new talent.  Then they want to charge $20 for a CD from mediocre artist with one or two listenable tracks on it.  No wonder CD sales suffered.  When you can purchase a brand new DVD for $15 on sale upon release what could the labels be thinking?  Is a music CD worth the same amount?  $10 is the perfect price for a CD based on the retail landscape. <br /> <br />They have actually started developing new artists at a better pace over the past few years and CD sales have bounced back a bit.  Interesting... <br /> <br />Nice try Sony...
B00005JOHI|5.0|Colin Firth's Darcy versus Matthew MacFayden's Darcy is a matter of taste and endurance.  Colin, Jennifer Ehle, and A&E articulate all the nuance possible for Jane Austen's text.  Matthew, Kiera Knightly, and director, Joe Wright cut through the fat and get to the meat, which is a good thing.  I have seen both versions (mini series and movie) and like them both.  It's a good thing that there are so many versions of this story available; this is a testament to the value of the basic story.<br /><br />Some may have problems with Joe Wright's 2005 movie version, but it is refreshing to see this interpretation/adaptation of the story.  The Bennets are brilliant cast as very rural gentry, which is what they were.  Moreover, Darcy and Bingley are not overly fastidious, as urbane gentlemen.  Judy Dench, of course, nails aristocratic Lady Catherine.  These are three levels of English society.  Social caste was critical during that time, so it is important that Wright emphasize levels such as aristocracy, urbane gentility, and rural landed gentry.  It is very credible in either version that these city boys (Darcy and Bingley) would prefer country girls rather than too polished city girls, as sometimes the artifice must stop.<br /><br />If pigs in the country offend, or museum-quality mansions on the other side of the country seem cold and unlivable, then stick with the A&E version, which sticks very close to Jane Austen's book.  This 2-hour movie is refreshing, brief, and \\"artistic.\\"
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This is the very rare sort of movie that is captivating for its story and action, not to mention the job everyone \\"aboard\\" does in their roles in depicting what was in reality a hard, dangerous, and in many ways by our 'modern' sensibilities grotesque life... but is also amazingly detailed in its historical accuracy with regards to what was accepted as normal and expected behavior and interaction, living conditions, naval medicine (there's a REASON they're loading up large baskets of limes at that tropical port... and it wasn't just so British sailors could become known as \\"limeys\\"!) tactics, one even comes to appreciate the art and skill involved in accurate navigation then. I could go on, but what else can I say but to raise my own glass in toast to the \\"...lesser of two weevils\\"! What does THAT mean? Watch the movie! A fun, exciting, interesting and even educational film for those unfamiliar with that period of history, and a film that will be appreciated by those who are familiar with that period.
B0009F9O6M|5.0|This was the 1st VDGG remaster I picked up and oh, my! did it live up to what I hoped it would be.  Someone earlier said that these Charisma bands suffered from a kitchen-sink-induced murkiness in the production, largely because they were trying to stretch the then-new 16-track technology to its absolute limits... that's what makes these remasters (and in particular our friend Hydrogen to Helium here) so great and so long overdue.  Comparing the new CDs to the old ones (and, God forbid, the \\"First Generation\\" compilation from the 1980s) is like looking at a high-resolution struck print of a photograph versus a Xerox made on a faulty machine, there is no comparison, really. <br /> <br />Anyway this is a classic album made all-the-more towering by the inclusion of the ridiculous live-in-the-studio bonus take of the heretofore mythical \\"Squid/Octopus\\" opus.  Progressive Rock was (at its best, like here) a truly creative enterprise before it collapsed under the weight of its own self-image around the time PG quit Genesis and Fripp (who tears up a nice sustain-y Les Paul excursion on \\"The Emperor In His War Room\\" here) broke up Crimson the first time... and this late-1970 record proves it with the inimitable VDGG triumverate of loopy stop/start/dissolve/jumpcut cinematic arrangements, magnificent drums/double sax interplay from Guy Evans and D-Jax, and the manically panicked vocal stylings of Hammill.   Hugh Banton, who built his instruments from the ground up, contributes his usual quota of terrifying organissimo as well... he is kind of the bridge between Hammill and the unusual rhythm section. <br /> <br />Standouts include the Prog staple \\"Killer\\" (a real whale of a song, indeed), the sci-fi mindf*ck \\"Pioneers Over C\\" and the aforementioned antiwar anthem \\"The Emperor In His War Room,\\" which could be about Josef Stalin or even \\"Dandy Don\\" Rumsfeld.  Yes and did I mention the bonus track of \\"Squid/Octopus\\" makes EL&P sound like the 1910 Fruitgum Company? <br /> <br />Again, if you don't have these VDGG remasters, you really aren't fully alive.  Grab them and see where Johnny Rotten learned to scream-sing. <br /> <br />
B000000OUJ|5.0|This may be the illest album besides \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\", that Wu-tang has ever put out. The GZA let's u hear the lyrical warfare on each track. If u are or even if ur not a Wu-tang fan, pick up this album.
B000003S0D|5.0|What a record.  Still inspires a double-mellotron sized rift among KC enthusiasts... as you can see by the 79 preceding screeds, you love it or you absolutely loathe it.  I love it.    It is nearly impossible to envision that the musical landscape could accomodate this one as \\"popular\\" once upon a time.  The drugs must've been plentiful and good, real good.  Opens with one of the great 'tron epics, all the fun of the Cirkus.  Peter Sinfield's lyrics are as terribly awful as advertised, yet suit the musical framework exquisitely, elevating both.  You could argue that punk happened largely because of the content of songs just like this one.      Then, Indoor Games, perhaps the only rock song ever to contain the word \\"sycophantic\\".  Absolutely treacherous acoustic playing from Fripp, the first side of the album he plays all acoustic guitar and mellotron, a Crim rarity.  Gordon Haskell laughs the track out of the building, perhaps the ridiculousness of what he is singing causes him to dissolve into hysterics.  Instantly we drop into \\"Happy Family,\\" about the breakup of them Beatles which was then current.  Great contributions from Keith Tippett and the horn guys, get his albums (\\"I Am There, You Are Here,\\" \\"Dedicated to You But You Weren't Listening\\") because they are awesomely great.  Side one ends with Haskell's beautiful vocal on Lady of the Dancing Water, shimmering even if the lyrics are once again romantic claptrap.    Side two begins with the Affirmative Mr. Jon Anderson and a catchy-but-trite handclap chorus exhorting the listener to stake a Lizard by the throat, proceeding into a mellotron-soaked epic that makes Genesis' \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" seem light on that most proggly-regal of instruments.  If you listen closely enough you can probably hear Gordon Haskell's innermost thoughts as he contemplates punching his old school chum Fripp in the face for making him sing these lyrics.  Get his subsequent album \\"It Is and It Isn't,\\" which is utterly fantastic, for a40-minute glimpse of Gord in his proper element, which consists of tunes not titled \\"The Battle of Glass Tears\\".    This record is awesome, totally uncompromising, all over the place, like a hit of acid right down to the cover, one of the most beautiful sleeves ever made.  Also it's the recipient of perhaps the greatest review ever given an album: \\"It's the record for the person you like least of all, but for one reason or another are forced to buy them a present.  The abyss where rock and modern jazz meet.\\"    They just do NOT make 'em like this anymore, and it's nigh on impossible to believe they ever did in the first place.  5 stars just for the scope of the ambition behind its conception.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|For those of you who don't understand why certain characters were able to have powers like the Matrix its quiet simple. Anyone with Jenova's cells had the power to live \\"Matix\\" style. Or if I rememeber correctly from the game, the \\"Materia\\" or \\"Life Stream\\".
B000003S0I|5.0|This is arguably the finest Progressive Rock ever made... it finds Fripp and his eager new recruits straddling the terrain between the mellotron-dominated, ornately lyrical balladry of Crims past (\\"Exiles,\\" \\"Book of Saturday\\") and the improvisational anarcho-funk of \\"Dark Magus\\" & \\"On the Corner\\"-era Miles Davis ensembles (\\"LTIA 1&2\\" & \\"The Talking Drum\\").  These guys are simply not fooling around, and 33 years later the music stands up like it was recorded centuries in the future. <br /> <br />Words are useless in describing this music; it might be the pinnacle achievement of this group, itself certainly one of the greatest, most creative bands in the history of All Music (not just Rock) no matter who the various players are/were in any given permutation or incarnation of the Beast known as KC.  If I had to find some feeble words to paint a picture for the uninitiated, I might say that this music hybridizes the inestimable power of two of the giants of 20th Century music: Bela Bartok & Jimi Hendrix, that's the best I can hope to do. <br /> <br />When Fripp got this version of Crimson together, he was fond of saying that as musicians working in the hugely popular and influential world of popular rock music, he and his fellow explorers could \\"change the world\\".  Judging by this little slice of circular plastic I'd say he was right; I can really only speak for myself and this album changed my life and the way I hear & think about music more than maybe any other album. <br /> <br />A bold statement, but not an exaggeration...if you do not have this one you must get your ears on it sooner than later, because it is that rare document that retains the capacity to recalibrate the mind (without use of artificial enhancing agents either). <br /> <br />
B0000BYM3K|4.0|This was their second effort with 3 guitarists and bruce back to voice. But if we compare it to the predecessor the consistance  <br />of the songs in general is weaker, but it's still worthy.I agree with these reviewers who say that the sleeve isn't so cool. <br />Too evil for my taste. <br /> <br />Wildest dreams was the worst single they ever recorded to me (although there is a special Eddie than even can be found on t-shirts), but some people like it (because I knew that fans sang it with the band in a concert in Rio de Janeiro,Brazil). <br />Its chorus had a mediocre feel to me. I never listen to this track. Conclusion : Love or hate it  <br /> <br />The second worst piece in this cd is the title track. The melody is interesting, but repeated in the guitar solos and in bruce Dickinson's sung lines. Tirering,isn't it? The slow part is boring too(before that repeated melody). What a mistake! <br /> <br />Now the goodies: <br /> <br /> <br />David Murray's solos continue to be mindblowing as always. Hear him in age of innocence (from 3:16 to 3:43), Rainmaker (all solos and licks  minus that one in 2:24 where everybody take part) or in Paschendale ( from 4:53 to 5:13) <br />My favourites are: <br /> <br />Rainmaker: This isn't so complex, but it's brilliant in opposite to the other single. The bridge is catchy. 10/10 <br /> <br />Paschendale: That's one of the most original ever done by Maiden. <br />It was inspired in the 2nd world war in lyrics. I loved the idea <br />of that triple riffing with a quick stop in the first part of song. Anyway, killer track to sum up. 11/10 <br /> <br />The other marks: <br /> <br />No more lies -> 10 /10  <br /> <br />Gates of tomorrow: Good harmony intro and chorus -> 10/10 <br /> <br />Montsgur ->  Adrian Smith takes many parts here. 8/10 <br /> <br />Face in the sand -> 8/10 <br /> <br />New frontier -> 8/10 <br /> <br />Age of innocence - > 9.5 /10 <br /> <br />Journey man - > no rock and roll , but great Bruce peformance,anyway 9/10 <br /> <br />Forget the 2 bad tracks ( or not, it depends on you )and up the irons...... <br /> <br />
B0009F9O6W|5.0|This might be, in terms of the sonic improvement quotient, the best of the VDGG remasters, which is fitting because this is the one where they go completely hogwild with the production values and tape manipulations.    Of course as was stated earlier in the reviews this is one of the ten essential Progressive Rock albums...this is perhaps also the most balls-out psychotically crazy LP ever to make it to Number One in any country in the history of the charts.  The arrangements are dazzling, the songs are like nothing else ever recorded.  I had forgotten how incredible the opener, \\"Lemmings\\" is, especially since it deals with issues that are ripped from today's headlines as the powerful few manipulate and subjugate the misinformed many. Come to think of it, you could say that the whole record deals with war and conflict both internal (\\"Man-Erg\\"'s personality-split into Killers, Angels, Refugees, Dictators and Saviors; \\"Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\"'s descent into isolation and self-reflective madness) and external (\\"Lemmings\\" commentary on leadership's empty thirst for illegitimate power over compassionate stewardship).  Did I mention that \\"Man-erg\\" is an anagram for \\"German\\"?  Like I said this is one of the craziest albums ever put to wax, complete with burning guest-guitar from some guy called Robert Fripp.  The bonus tracks are very interesting as well, fleshing out (along with the \\"Squid/Octopus\\" bonus cut on the \\"H to He\\" remaster) what would have made this a double album back in the day had the record company not insisted on keeping it to a single.  \\"Theme One\\" and \\"W\\" are classic VDGG any way you slice it and it's great to have them included here.    Seriously, get these remasters and discover this amazing band if you already haven't done so... this ain't yer grandma's Prog.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I have to say, this movie was one of the best there is. Full of interesting characters and a good story. Now most of you people dont have a clue about this movie or what its about, but I happen to. Its about the main character Cloud wanting forgiveness from Aerith/Aeris because he thinks he let her die because he thinks he let Sephiroth kill her. Then 3 new people with Jenova cells in them like Sephiroth appear and want to get Jenova back. Because they and Cloud have Geogstigma, they call Cloud brother. Most of the children have Geogstigma more than adults do, and the 3 brothers want to make a Reunion that Jenova started in the first placeby using the planet as a sort of ship to another planet where they can rule. And for those people who have no clue about the game shouldnt say the movie has no plot. The storyline of FFVII as simple as I can put it: A group of people have their reasons for hating Sephiroth or ShinRa or something and join together to stop or destroy it. Sephiroth seeks to be a complte god, and believe he and his 'Mother' Jenova are Cetras, or Ancients. <br /> <br />Now thats all Im saying. Graphics and music awesome, storyline is awesome, everything is aweomse about this movie.

B000002B30|1.0|Making this unprincipled betrayal of core American values all the more stinging is, by his own confession, his respectably working-class roots, where he grew up next to a gas station in a small New Jersey town. His modestly humble, unpretentious parents even admitted to the room-for-improvement in their lives when they moved to a bigger house from Randolph Street to Institute Street. Springsteen's parents understood the essence of Americanism in its promise of social mobility no matter your background--yet Springsteen spits on this sanctity like Kerry the Defeatist by equating ALL actions of America with tarnishes of \\"global hegemony\\", \\"colonialism\\", \\"might makes right\\", or whatever other socialist-menacing psychosis this unsatisfactory-educated \\"Boss\\" invents. Springsteen's been glaringly seduced by the entertainment community's leftist dictatorship and its mentally depraved, conspiring enforcement of herd-mentality that America's the \\"problem\\".
B000000I0C|4.0|Peter Hammill was a busy man in the mid-to-late 70s. Van Der Graaf Generator, the prog-music band he headed, was in the middle of its famous \\"second phase\\", and its critical and commercial heydays.<br /><br />\\"Over\\" (8 tracks, 46 min.) was released in 1977, and recorded in a 2 week period. It captures Peter Hammill's feelings following a recent hard-to-take relationship break-up. The opening track \\"Crying Wolf\\" throws down the gauntlet, a musically agressive track that would have fitted nicely on any Phase 2 VDGG album, yet showing clear bitter feelings about what has gone wrong. Many of the following tracks are much more mellow, introspect, even sad (and clearly make this a solo album, not some VDGG-clone), check out \\"Autumn\\" and \\"This Side of the Looking Glass\\", with orchestral instrumentation, or the epic 8+ min. \\"Time Heals\\" (the title speaks for itself). The closing track \\"Lost and Found\\" thankfully ends this dark and emotional album on an up note.<br /><br />I have loved this album for almost 30 years, and it still resonates with me as much today as it did when it came out in 1977. For another such bare and personal album that really works well (even if musically it is totally different), check out Over the Rhine's 2005 release \\"Drunkard's Prayer\\".

B000BJS4SU|5.0|I have found that when you reach a certain level of fame and popularity, there will only be people who either love you or hate you.    I am not a John Mayer fan.  Nor did I ever have the urge to even download his debut solo album to even get a sample of what his music is like.  If anything at all, the only song I ever remember hearing was \\"Bigger Than My Body\\" on the radio, which I did enjoy.    But after seeing John Mayer Trio on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, I was extremely impressed by what I saw.  Afterwards, I went and downloaded the album from iTunes and was definitely not disappointed.  John Mayer is an extremely talented musician and songwriter.  Currently one of the best singer-songwriters, the music industry has to offer in this age of punk (aka: loser rock) and hip-hop.  I've listened to alot of musicians, and Mayer shows an astonishing amount of growth and maturity for an artist at his age.     For this brief review, I really wanted to distance myself from all the others by not critcizing other reviews (good or bad), and so I will say this: Pino Palladino is on the bass and Steve Jordan is on the drums.  Palladino is practically a legend on the bass guitar.  He's performed and co-produced with D'Angelo, Eryka Badu, Common, The Who, Paul Simon, Edie Brickel, Roy Hargrove...just to name a few.  Jordan is a legend already with Grammy Awards tucked under his belt.  This guy has credits that range from Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Mick Jagger, and Neil Young.    So if on that basis, if John Mayer is such a terrible musician, why would 2 renowned music industry legends bother to record and go on tour with him?    Overall this album is fantastic.  It has a song for every mood.    \\"Good Love is On the Way\\" and \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" are great rock songs with strong blues and funk infusions that keep your head rockin' and your feet tappin'.  \\"Gravity\\" is a great song soul song that will relax every muscle in your body.  \\"Vultures\\" is by far my favourite, as it'sa fantastic blend of soul and blues, that needs to be listened to, to truly experience it's brilliance.    Whether it's soul, blues, easy listening, chillin', or even just rockin' out at times, that you're looking for in an album, this live release by John Mayer Trio is definitely a must have.  It is truly an album for all seasons.
0393327655|2.0|I bought this book after finding ch-2 (Nature of Belief)  <br />useful and informative.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed  <br />with the rest of the chapters.  The book says things that  <br />need to be said about religion in general.  The bold part  <br />of the book is its breaking the taboo to speak against faith. <br />However, these are not new. I guess every few years some one  <br />has to remind people with a new book. <br />(Read Carl Sagan and Bertrand Russell for a better comprehensive study) <br /> <br />I found it bizarre to favor Budhism (even with those  <br />weak arguments) which is practically a religion.  And  <br />I didn't understand the need to single-out Islam, in a  <br />book about 'End of Faith.'  Maybe, the author wanted  <br />to get things off his chest about Islam.  Also, the book  <br />seems needlessly long.   <br /> <br />Where the book deals with politics, its either insincere  <br />or completely naive.  Admitting Roy/Chomsky's point about <br />(USA posing as) \\"well-intentioned giant\\" is not really a <br />counter-argument for that point.  Infact, the author writes  <br />that he is astonished why these intellectuals fail to see  <br />the (validitiy/legitimacy of the) giant.  Hm..? <br /> <br />His \\"Ethics on Collateral Damage\\" is based on a fallacious <br />argument(using intent) and is used later to justify torture. <br /> <br />The author writes: \\"where ethics are concerned, intentions  <br />are everything\\" with a footnote saying \\"intentions matter,  <br />but they are not all that matters\\"   I am surprised that <br />reviewers of the manuscript didn't catch this before going  <br />to print. <br /> <br />In the end, in \\"What can we do?\\" he suggests the world  <br />govt idea.  But he didn't find it important enough to  <br />explain the 'stand against Iraq war' by UN, which is the  <br />closest (yet far) we have for any world body.  Given  <br />that he endorses the war, this seems to be a contradiction,  <br />or wilful omission. <br /> <br />The chapter on mysticism is something I would have avoided  <br />at all cost.  While the author did not bring Hinduism to  <br />the forefront, he tries to relate the 'rise of mysticism  <br />in asia' to lack of faith in asian religions.  I like to  <br />refer the author to 'Bhagvad Gita' (Bible of Hinduism) and  <br />how it prohibits everyone to NOT ask critical questions <br />to Lord Krishna. :-)  There were years of failed struggle  <br />India went (is going) through to encourage  <br />critical-free-thinking (which was effectively killed  <br />by Hindu-Vedas) <br /> <br />Brittanica's religion-data in asia:(in millions, in mid-1995) <br />775 Hindus, 760 Muslims, 701 non-religious, 320 Buddhists, 306 Christians... <br />One cannot reasonably delve into topics on mysticism  <br />by completely avoiding Hinduism. <br /> <br />I didn't see this last chapter doing justice to a  <br />rational treatise on Eastern Mysticism.  Rushing a <br />few ideas in a small chapter is bound to entertain  <br />silly notions about existense of Soul without Body, <br />(life?) after death ideas etc.
B000056NX5|5.0|After having been forced several times in the late 70's to sit through the original hippie film during school religious education classes I vowed I would never voluntarily see this show again. <br /> <br />My wife attended the revival version while it was on tour in 2000 and later bought this DVD. I was subsequently forced to sit through it, and found I enjoyed every minute. <br /> <br />This version is excellent and much better (relevant to today ?) than the original film version. No wonder one of the original authors regards this as the definitive version ! I agree.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|My two favorite movies of all time (ones I could watch over and over) are Titanic and Goodfellas. A die-hard fan must have this set. I received it as a Christmas gift and one must devote several days to really go through the entire set. There are five different ways to watch the movie alone: 1) The regular way, as it was released; 2)with commentary by James Cameron, 3)with commentary by the cast and crew 4) with historical commentary (truly appreciated by historians such as myself) and with the \\"making of the movie/how they did it\\" scenes interspersed. That alone would take one uninterrupted day. Then you can watch all of the deleted scenes which, in my opinion, should have been left in. Not one of them is garbage and some are very helpful in tying things together, like how Rose went from looking pristine to disheveled before she decided to jump off the ship in the beginning, or what happened to Lovejoy. There are many, many more extras that I cannot begin to tell how great they are, including the entire 45 min special on the making of the movie that aired on tv. There is also the alternate ending which did have one great line that should have been added into the final release - where Rose tells Brock \\"You look for treasure in all the wrong places, Mr. Lovett. Only life is priceless. And making each day count.\\" <br /> <br />So, go count your money, make your day count, and go buy this special collector's edition so you can give the regular dvd to a relative or friend.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|If your not stupid, you can most likely appreciate this movie. It is in my top 10. It is a cult classic if you havn't heard. A must SEE. RENT IT. Then BUY IT! Don't be off put by the stupid art design on the directors cut box.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Nothing compares to Wicked!! The CD is amazingly AWESOME!! Every time I listen to it my favorite song changes. Every song on the CD is FABULOUS. Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are the perfect singers for this soundtrack and both are extremely talented. I highly recommend buying this Wicked CD, you will definitely not be disappointed!!
B000BKDOCA|5.0|HER NEW ALBUM WILL BE OUT ON MARCH ITS ALL OUTTAKES FROM EACH OF HER ALBUMS AND SOME NEW TRACKS FEATURING KANYE WEST
B0001LJCMK|5.0|Josh Homme has become a sort of \\"King Midas\\" of good modern rock.  I don't understand, but Kyuss and Eagles of Death Metal are as amazing as Queens of the Stone age.  Litarally, everything this guy touches turns to gold.  Eagles of Death Metal rock like mad, to sum things up.  Yes, the songs may sound the same, but its a good thing in this case.  Just pick it up, especially all you Queens of the Stone Age fans.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Madonna's most underappreciated album \\"American life\\" was her most unsuccessful album to date, its also the only album of her's to not even release one major hit single. It was given harsh (and unfair) criticism by almost every critic in america. despite it debuting at #1 it quickly fell off the charts where it disappeared into oblivion. it was called anti-american (totally not true, just listen to it) and the song \\"American life\\" was highly controversial, especially the video. The top 5 songs on the album are (in specific order): <br /> <br />1. Nothing fails (10/10) A beautifully stunning song, that i think was meant towards her husband or something. Best on AL. <br /> <br />2. Mother and father (9/10) Nice dance song, the verses arent great but the chorus are. <br /> <br />3. X-static process (8/10) Yeah, a little boring however, its a very good song. kind made me put out a tear at the end of the song (kinda) <br /> <br />4. Intervention (8/10) A good song that gets better towards the end. I think this song was for her baby boy that she had shortly before this. <br /> <br />5. Nobody knows me (8/10) Pretty good, though like \\"Intervention\\" i think it gets better at the end. Very good song. <br /> <br />the only ones i didnt like were: <br /> <br />\\"I'm so stupid\\" (one of her worst ever) <br />\\"Die another day\\" (not terribly bad, i can tolerate it more than \\"i'm so stupid\\" but not good either.) <br /> <br />if you dont purchase american life, you are missing out on some good songs. dont believe the critics, just give it a try and you might like it. <br />  <br />
0393312836|5.0|I have not seen the movie \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and at my 3rd attempt at reading the book, I finally finished. The lanuage is very hard to understand AT FIRST. Once you get more into the book, it starts to clear up. My message is this: Do not give up on reading it. Its GREAT.
B00004X01U|3.0|Why \\"Music\\" managed to do so well compared to \\"American life\\" is beyond me. Dont get me wrong, i like this album, but i just dont think its her best. <br /> <br />Music (5/10) Not the worst on the album and not the best. its an okay song. <br /> <br />Impressive instant (8/10) I like this song, its a weird song but still good and danceable.  <br /> <br />Runaway lover (1/10) pretty weak <br /> <br />I deserve it (8/10) A slightly slow song that kinda reminds me of a country tune. i like this one alot. <br /> <br />Amazing (9/10) Though a clear ripoff of her hit \\"Beautiful stranger\\" i still perfer this version over the other. <br /> <br />Nobody's perfect (10/10) My favorite song on the album, the very end is the best part, \\"MMMM...MMMM...YEAH\\" <br /> <br />Dont tell me (8/10) Good song, i hated this so much at first, but as time grew i started to like it more and more. <br /> <br />What it feels like for a girl (10/10) Very good song, i like it alot. the video was very controversial and was banned (i think) from MTV. <br /> <br />Paradise (not for me) (0/10) This song is not for me lol <br /> <br />Gone (8/10) Good song, though it should have been made a bit longer in length of time. <br /> <br />Not very good but still worth having. Had the american version of this album included the single American pie and Cyber-raga, it would have been a little better.
0385484518|5.0|a beautiful, touching story. I also reccommend \\"the five people you meet in heaven\\"
B000B8QEZG|5.0|COADF is a wonderful masterpiece, and is definitely one of Madonna's best album to date. She's back on top but i believe she never left it. Though many argue her last album was a huge disappointment, rather i think it was pretty good. Anyways, back on topic. <br /> <br />1. Hung Up (10/10) The first single of this album, and the best dance track on here. It contains a sample of Abba's \\"Gimme, Gimme, Gimme\\". I love this song, especially after the second verse where things pick up a bit. <br /> <br />2. Get together (8/10) I didnt like it at first, but its slowly growing on me. Its a good song, but it does for some reason remind me of Kylie Minogue. <br /> <br />3. Sorry (10/10) The second best dance track on the album, i love this song. Dont let the title full you, almost word by word it would make a good breakup song. Though, it is a bit weaker compared to Hung Up. Its also her second single. <br /> <br />4. Future lovers (5/10) I dont like this song that much, however, like the song \\"Get together\\" it too is growing on me. Give it some time and i may give it a higher rating.  <br /> <br />5. I Love New York (0/10) I hate this song, its the only one on the album that i really hate. <br /> <br />6. Let it will be (9/10) Very good song, especially towards the end. I really hope this will be a future single. It gets a bit repetitive after a while though. <br /> <br />7. Forbidden love (9/10) The slowest song on here, yet its still very good. Its like a semi-ballad (sorta). Very good chorus. <br /> <br />8. Jump (9/10) A great dance song, however i find this song to be the weakest dance song on the album. But its still great and also rumored to be a future single. I love the line \\"We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me. The only thing you can depend is your family\\"...so true. <br /> <br />9. How High (8/10) Another good dance song, possibly slightly better than Jump. However, towards the end of the song i usually just tune out the rest.  <br /> <br />10.Isaac (5/10) Not my favorite, but its still nice. The chorus is the best part. The Chorus also reminds me of the songs \\"Frozen\\" and \\"Secret\\". Listen to the chorus and you'll know what i mean. <br /> <br />11. Push (15/10) Absolutely my favorite song on the album. Although \\"Push\\" is something i'd expect off of her 2000 album \\"Music\\", its great and has a wonderful message. Right now, it is rumored as a possible future single, i hope it becomes one. I know it would do well on the charts. <br /> <br />12. Like it or not (2/10) I hate this song, i only give it a 2 cuz of the lyrics. I like the message of the song though. Listen to it, you'll know what i mean. Its a bit slow tempo to. <br /> <br />Overall: (4.5/5) I still think \\"Ray of light\\" is better, BUT COADF is definately a must for any fan of Madonna. This album is wonderfully crafted and lets hope her next album will be even better. Also, if you havent purchased this album and are waiting to, i reccomend you purchase the special edition of COADF, it contains a new track called \\"Fighting Spirit\\". I havent heard the song, but its basically all the same just with a new track.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Admittedly I was hesitant: like many fans of the music, I already own all three Lord of the Rings scores. Was it really worth buying more? I took the chance, and just a few minutes into listening I had my answer: You bet.<br /><br />Not only does this first-time release of the complete Fellowship score give you hours of beautiful new music not previously available, but it also includes gorgeous new orchestrations of the themes you already have if you own the abridged albums.<br /><br />These are better.<br /><br />All those tracks that were cut short, deleted or combined to fit on the original CD are restored to their full length and orchestration. This music is far superior to the original CD, and is worth every penny.<br /><br />A terrific bonus is the booklet on the score. Not mere liner notes, this is a detailed education into how an epic film score is created. You get a glimpse into the mind of Howard Shore and how he conceived every theme and variation.<br /><br />With brief bars of the score printed alongside detailed notes, including exactly where on the CDs we first hear each theme and each variant, you can get as richly rewarding a listening experience as you desire. I found it fascinating to learn, for example, why Shore chose a boys chorus at one point and a solo Irish whistle at another for the same theme, to evoke specific moods and places; or why the main Fellowship Theme develops in mere fragments at first until it is finally heard much later in all its fully orchestrated glory; or how it actually utilizes part of the sinister Seduction of the Ring Theme, transposed to a major key; or why Shore chose to make the Ring theme the only one that does not vary in instrumentation, key or style. These and dozens more more insightful tidbits broaden your appreciation of the score -- and the careful design of the film.<br /><br />It is packaged beautifully and intelligently, as you can see in the photos Amazon has provided.  I cannot wait for the next two to be released.<br /><br />(Two track details: 1. I'm particularly happy this set includes one of the most beautiful Lord of the Rings themes, in my opinion, which until now one could only hear in the extended versions of the movies [or at Shore's symphonic concerts]. Here, it's on Disc 2, partway into Track 9 [\\"Gilraen's Memorial\\"], at 3:00. Brief, but powerfully stirring.  2. Thankfully, this set also includes the full version of the heartrending theme played after Gandalf's fall -- it runs over twice as long as the original abridged release. Disc 3, Track 1 [\\"Khazad-Dum\\"], at 5:45.)<br /><br />Note on price: it is very fair and absolutely worth it. Some have complained it shouldn't be more expensive than the extended DVD movie, but one must remember that far, far fewer people buy scores than DVDs, and fewer still will buy a 3-disc extension of a score they already own. To be worth the extensive time and cost of producing it for a niche market, this must be priced a bit higher. Given the extremely high quality and detail and extras that have gone into this set, I am perfectly satisfied.ularly happy this set includes one of the most beautiful Lord of the Rings themes, in my opinion, which until now one could only hear in the extended versions of the movies [or at Shore's symphonic concerts].

B000002N3J|5.0|I want you (with Masssive attack) (5/10) never could get into this one. although i must say its still a pretty song. i also dont like the orchestral version at the end. <br /> <br />I'll remember (10/10) Great wonderful song, this song is the reason why i purchased this collection. <br /> <br />Take a bow (9/10) very good song, such a sweet love song. <br /> <br />You'll see (10/10) this song is so beautiful, i love it. the chorus is great and kinda puts a tear in my eye. <br /> <br />Crazy for you (9/10) not her best ballad song but still a great song.  <br /> <br />This used to be my playground (0/10) never really liked it much. <br /> <br />Live to tell (10/10) I love this song so much, she has such an amazing voice in it. <br /> <br />Love dont live here anymore (0/10) bland/boring <br /> <br />Something to remember (0/10) again, kinda bland and boring <br /> <br />Forbidden love (0/10)Dont like this one either. its weird though that there is another song by the same name of off her COADF album. <br />           <br />One more chance (0/10) i hate this one and it sounds like a song someone sang before. maybe its a cover song? <br /> <br />Rain (10/10) next to the power of goodbye, this song is her best ballad ever. the song is beautiful and the video is amazing and pretty. <br /> <br />Oh father (10/10) a haunting, yet another classic song by madonna herself.  <br /> <br />this collection just proves that madonna has a GREAT voice and that she can sing, and not just dance. her ballads on here are some of the greatest ever made.
0684824906|1.0|It is highly unfortunate that best-selling historical writing has basically become long book reports.<br /><br />Kearns Goodwin uncovers nothing new in this book on Lincoln and his key cabinent members. What the reader receives is Kearns Goodwin's editing and repackaging of many resources, comparable with a college composition, only longer.<br /><br />Save your money and try to find down Gore Vidal's outstanding history/fiction book, Lincoln. One will learn and appreciate so much more the life and times of arguably the greatest president at a paperback price.
B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of light is her most mature and best album to date.  <br /> <br />Drowned world (6/10) Meh, so-so. its nice but not very good. <br /> <br />Swim (0/10) I could never get into this song. i dont like it all.  <br /> <br />Ray of light (10/10) A great upbeat pop/dance song that always puts me in a good mood. i love it. <br /> <br />Candy perfume girl (8/10) Not bad, nice little song. though its not my favorite. <br /> <br />Skin (10/10) a great song, with a wonderful sound to it. so futuristic-like and all. i love it.  <br /> <br />Nothing really matters (10/10) a great song to dance to that unfortunately failed miserably on the charts in america. i love this song to and the video is simply great. <br /> <br />Sky fits heaven (10/10) Very good chorus, i also love this song. I wish it had became a single. <br /> <br />Shanti/Ashtangi (8/10) Though its not in english, its still a great song. <br /> <br />Frozen (10/10) Quite possibly her greatest song ever made. i love this song, and the chorus is the best part. <br /> <br />The power of goodbye (15/10) A beautifully stunning song and the video was so outstanding. i LOVE this song so much. quite possibly her greatest ballad to this day. <br /> <br />To have and not to hold (0/10) I hate this song, pretty boring. <br />  <br />Little star (8/10) Its growing on me slowly, its a nice song that is dedicated to her daughter. <br /> <br />Mer girl (0/10) a very bland song where she talks but not sings. <br /> <br />Despite the first two songs and last 3 (except little star) not be all that great, Ray of light is still her best album yet. You go Madonna! <br />
B0006GAI6O|5.0|I won't bore you with the plot of the movie or the actor's names. I loved this movie, I rented it, took it back to the rental center and bought it. The alternate beginning and dance scene of Gere and Lopez are worth the price of admission, and by the way, it is a SEX scene and the reason for the plot.Gere wasn't bored with his life, he saw a beautiful face in the window and he wanted to met her.  The supporting characters give the movie a huge boost, and the movie moves along as it is supposed to with only one or two moments where I felt the urge to go to the kitchen. Soon I will take up ballroom dancing because of this movie. Please, enjoy.
B000AE8FZS|5.0|I've always felt this album was underrated, largely because it has never been properly mastered before--even the original vinyl release sounded weak. But now this album has been properly remastered, and I must say that my high expectations have been met. I can say without hesitation that Interview has never sounded so good! <br /> <br />So without further ado, for those of you who are not familiar with this gem, here's the blow by blow: <br /> <br />1) \\"Interview\\"--a playful adventure in hard-driving, pointilistic funk, with Kerry alternating between organ stabs and lilting electric piano until the instrumental bridge--and oh my god, what a bridge! First Kerry cuts loose on thumbtack (i.e. honky-tonk) piano for a bit--which slides into a minimalist section featuring assorted weird sounds while Gary plays a complex melodic line that's catchier than it should be--on what sounds like an electric sitar! It's nothing short of wondrous in that way only GG can do. Peaks out to a beautiful, majestic end! WOW!!! <br /> <br />2) \\"Give It Back\\"--Back in the day the band took some heat for doing this song, I guess because it seemed somewhat trendy to do a reggaeish tune in 1976. However, decades later it's hard to imagine why we wouldn't want to hear John and Ray tackle reggae in alternating 7/8 and 5/8 time, especially with a Zappaesque atonal bridge featuring MARIMBA!!! I think it's delightful, very fun and uplifting. Unlike anything else they ever recorded. <br /> <br />3) \\"Design\\"--It's natural to want to compare this to GG's other masterpieces utilizing a capella vocals, \\"Knots\\" and \\"On Reflection\\". While the others were, respectively, clever and joyous, this one could best be described as dark and haunting. Anybody who thinks that GG's experiments were lacking in passion should be exposed to this--Kerry's melancholy lead over dissonant background vocals, and jarring drums that crash in a tribal crescendo. THIS is the sound of dreams shattering. <br /> <br />4) \\"Another Show\\"--Another take on the \\"Cogs in Cogs'\\" style of controlled chaos, done in breakneck 10/8 time, with John Weathers absolutely all over the place. Could be alternatively titled \\"See Kerry Abuse His Hammond Pt. 1\\", as he plays tuned percussion and whammy bar sounds on his organ. Fun, fun, fun!!! <br /> <br />5) \\"Empty City\\"--I think this song in particular suffered from the poor mastering on the original release. Here, it's a lush, dramatic pop song featuring Ray and Gary on twin acoustic guitars, Kerry on tres '70s e-piano and string synth, great saxes by Derek (his best ever, IMHO), and another beautiful choral arrangement. Simply lovely. <br /> <br />6) \\"Timing\\"--or \\"See Kerry Abuse His Hammond Pt.2\\" as he uses his organ to play grunge guitar. Meanwhile Ray pulls out his trusty violin and saws into your brain, and Gary performs what Jack Black would call a \\"face-melting guitar solo\\". The atonal, crunching bridge suggests that GG had been listening to KC's \\"Red\\" album for inspiration. The band never rocked harder than they did here. Awesome!!! <br /> <br />7) \\"I Lost My Head\\"--Everybody's favorite song off the album in its original release, and it sounds even better now--partly because some sweet compression has been added to the track, and partly because everything else on the album sounds so great. Kerry's delicate vocals and fetching instrumental counterpoint (featuring real harpsichord, I believe) open the song. Then it rises, and adroitly slides into the closing theme while the hair stands up on the back of your neck, in anticipation of the glorious riff-rock coda. And there it is, perhaps GG's greatest riff, the band pounding it home while Derek wails passionately, before fading into eternity. A wonderful cherry on top of a perfect sundae. <br /> <br />The live version of \\"Interview\\" is rather poorly recorded, and not that well performed. But no matter. If you think you've heard the album before, you haven't--the remastering has finally revealed the genius ofthe music. If you've never heard it before, well, you're in for a treat, because I think it stands among the pantheon of great GG albums now, alongside \\"Octopus\\", \\"IAGH\\", \\"Free Hand\\", and \\"TPATG\\"--really.  <br /> <br />My last words? BUY IT--NOW!!!
B00005JO17|2.0|Chicken Little, voiced by Zach Braff (Tv's Scrubs, Garden State), rings the bell yelling \\"The Sky is Falling\\" but it isnt true, so this upsets the towns folk and makes everyone in town made and his Dad, voiced by Garry Marshall is too. He then tries to impress his Dad by going on the baseball team, in which he wins the game for the team and this makes his Dad proud of him. Then, a piece of the sky does fall into Chicken Little's room and he brings his friends there so they can see as well. Then, they find the mother load....a big spaceship which was hidden like the sky. Soon, Chicken Little screams again that there is \\"an alien spaceship\\" and it vanished which enrages the townsfolk more. Then the aliens attack because their son (Kirby) is missing. So Chicken Little and his gang try to flee the on coming alien onslaught in order to bring back the little furry kid. Funny in small does, pointless in some and it's really just for kids...that's if some kids like it. The Porkcupine was cool, he delivered three lines \\"Yo,  No and Whoa!\\" Also starring the voices of Steve Zahn (Suburbia, Sahara), Joan Cusack (High Fidelity, Grosse Pointe Blank), Fred Willard (A Mighty Wind, Best in Show), Cathrine O'Hara (Home Alone 1&2), Amy Sedaris (Stay, Bewitched), Patrick Warburton (Kronks New Groove, The Venture Bros.), Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: First Contact, MasterMinds), Adam West (Family Guy, Batman), Wallace Shawn (Princess Bride, Melinda and Melinda), Harry Shearer (This Is Spinal Tap, A Mighty Wind) and Don Knotts (Pleasantville, Andy Griffith) as Mayor Turkey Lurkey. Even some of the animation kinda gets boring after awhile.
B00000JCB2|4.0|- RETROSPECT REVIEW<br /><br />~Del Keyes in 1999 (or \\"9 teen 90 nine\\")~<br /><br />WOW! THIS ALBUM IS COOL! It has a lotta awesome tracks, I love Just Like This, Nookie, Break Stuff, ALL OF IT!  This is my first Limp Bizkit album, and it shows how much I want my music to be, nothing but rock and rap, two music together.  Ain't it great?!  I'm so devoided to the band that I bought the red hat that Fred wears in his videos, I'm so cool.  There's no pop crap in here, it's all metal and headshaking, something that should be no. 1 in the TRL.<br /><br />BACKSTREET BOYS SUCK!<br /><br />~Del Keyes in 2006~<br /><br />I was 13 and had little taste in the music variety, alright.  Even so, to this day, I still have my positive moments listening to this album.  I can understand why real music fans don't like a group like Limp Bizkit: they're loud, they're egotistical, and they are not that versitile; I mean, it's a follically-challanged frontman with a \\"gangsta-image\\" rapping about nonsense in every chorus with his ear-shattering screaming voice, how versitile is that?  But just because I realize this album is as deep as a brick, it doesn't mean I don't appreciate \\"Nookie\\" as much as I was in my mid years.<br /><br />Musically, as a metal-rap album, it sounds like a metal-rap album.  It has Wes Borland playing some heavy guitar riffs while DJ Lethal scratching some vinyls to give the metal attitude of the songs a hip-hop style.  Even if you hate the group, you gotta love these guys for what they do.  I love when Lethal does his solo intermissions after \\"Re-Arranged\\" and \\"Trust?\\", and if it wasn't for Borland's unique sense of on-key riffing, I wouldn't get into songs such as \\"I'm Broke\\" or \\"Break Stuff\\"...even though it's almost the same sound in each one.  No doubt \\"N 2 Gether Now\\" is the best song of the bunch, because it shows how actually well Fred Durst can rap and keep the same tone, and with Method Man in the mix, it's the best of both worlds...for the 90s.  As with Durst's singing like in \\"Re-Arranged\\"...he convinced me; he doesn't have a wonderful voice, but at least he's follows the notes.<br /><br />\\"Significant Other\\" is good for what it is: a trashy, style-over-substance, metal-rap LP for the angst-driven society with social issues.  It's also contains some very well-produced music and beats.  No offense to some, but I rather listen to \\"Nobody like you\\" over and over again instead of that awful Southern Rap that's popular at this time.  That song, along with the Huey Lewis-lyrical-inspired \\"Show Me What You Got\\", are the only two songs that I now considered weak, because one's too angsty and obnoxious while the other just feels dated.  As far as the lyrics go...well, I learned the less I know, the better.<br /><br />Still, this is the perfect album to listen to when I'm playing fast racing games like \\"Burnout.\\"  It has that sort of \\"I-can't-take-it-anymore\\" mood, and it takes it to the limit, so it's a guilty pleasure for my constant mood swings.  In retrospect, I don't regret myself for having \\"Significant Other\\" when I was young.  The only thing I can regret on is buying the group's subsequent album, \\"Chocolate Starfish\\"; that album was a piece of ****....for the 90s.  As with Durst's singing like in \\"Re-Arranged\\"...he convinced me; he doesn't have a wonderful voice, but at least he's follows the notes. <br /> <br />\\"Significant Other\\" is good for what it is: a trashy, style-over-substance, metal-rap LP for the angst-driven society with social issues.

B00000K31V|5.0|This movie has been underrated and certainly not received the acclaim it deserved.  <br /> <br />The casting was pefect; a young Jude Law and an almost heroin-chic looking Jennifer Jason-Leigh are perfect for their roles. <br /> <br />As usual, cronenberg is very freudian throughout. There is a lot of sexually suggestive imagery with there ever being any actual sex. The story really sucks you in and has a great twist at the end that I amsolutely did not expect...yet the twist does not define the movie. I have watched eXistenZ since and have still enjoyed the film even though I know what is coming. Actually, watching eXistenZ again gace me the oppurtunity to spot clues that I may hav e initially missed. <br /> <br />I highly reccomend adding eXistenZ to youe DVD collection.
B000BP86OG|5.0|I've realized from reading the reviews that there sure is alot of buzz going around about The Darkness. Whether or not you love 'em or hate 'em is irrelevent. People are buying the CD and this album made a prominent music magazine's top 25 list for '05.  One Way Ticket is undeniably catchy and different although give up trying to sing along with Justin Hawkins--his falsetto is cosmic.  The comparisons to Queen and others is a compliment more than anything.  I think people who are longing for ripping guitar solos should stick with their old standbys.  This band is making music in a totally untraditional style in many ways (sitar in One Way Ticket, pianos, hell--even almost exclusive falsetto, etc.)but very traditional in others......they're genious.  Don't be ashamed to like or even love The Darkness. There's a little darkness in all of us. A keeper for sure.
B0000640SA|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars simply because no other director or screen writer has the courage to be so daring in their story telling. <br /> <br />Memento begins with \\"an\\" answer. It may not be \\"the\\" answer and from their the viewer must figure things out backwards. It is very disconcerting and difficult to watch. It is not a movie you can see the first time and just relax, maybe missing a scene here or there...every scene is important...every answer will lead to a question. <br /> <br />I say watch this twice because at the end of your first viewing you will understand what happened but perhaps not really \\"get\\" all of the details that explain the series of events (that you just watched backwards). Viewing the film a second time is easier because you have an understanding of what will happen next (or do I mean before) and can therefore pick up a lot of the subtle's you may have missed first time around.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I heard about this band while I was on a Fall Out Boy site.  I like FOB so I decided to check them out on MySpace and I'm glad I did.  They only had one full song up (Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage), but I quickly fell in love with it.  I decided I must hear more of these guys so I went out and bought this CD. <br /> <br />And how great it is.  Their punkish/alternative/techno sound is just plain awesome and very original. I think all the songs on there are great but Camisado, Time To Dance, and Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off definitely stood out to me.  They have to be my 3 favorite tracks off of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out. <br /> <br />So I hear Panic! is making a music video for I Write Sins, Not Tragedies and I saw a few pictures from it.  I guess it's supposed to have a sort of western theme to it and I can't wait to watch it.  I just hope MTV doesn't grab a hold of it....  As for the song they picked, I like all the songs on her so I'm not bothered, but I would have rather seen one of my top 3 be made into a video. <br /> <br />No, I'm not one of those people who give every album they like 5 stars, but I really feel this one diserves it.  This is one of the most original bands I've heard in awhile and I enjoy every single track on there.  I definitely recommend it.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I thought I had seen all the 80's dance movies such as Flashdance, Footlose, and a few others. I like them and see them once a year but Dirty Dancing IS AN AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The music is good, I daresay the acting is good, and I must be turning into my mom but Patrick was kinda a cutie in this movie, despite how in his recent movies he looks really really bad. If your a teenager who liked Save the Last Dance or Honey gove this a try, the daning and music is better than any other dance flick.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|This one is the best of the Blade movies. It's darker, more violent and the villains are very cool. Not to mention the movie is highly entertaining. Thanks to G. Del Toro, he knows how to do a fine comic book movie!
0060899190|5.0|I bought this book for a friend for Christmas after I encountered the website a few months ago and introduced her to it.  I loved it so much I had to read it before I gave it to her.  There was so much of myself in there, and I felt so free when I was done reading.  The fact that there are other people out there who feel exactly like I do is amazing.  The colors inside are bright, even on the sadder postcards, and every postcard is unique.  I would recommend this to anyone who has ever felt alone in the world..this book will make you feel not so alone.
B000002H33|5.0|This quite simply is the best heavy metal album ever produced. Metallica where unique in there sound and this album shows the band at the peak of there powers.     It also is the last album with the legendary Cliff Burton R.I.P. Metallica can never produce something like this again, it is 8 tracks of pure brilliance.    Metallica ruled the 80s and there first album kill em all was a album which introduced thrash metal to the states along with bands such as metal church and exodus. Kill em all was good and they than produced Ride the lightning which is the second best metal album ever produced.     Metallica peaked with Master of Puppets it brang the band to the top of the heavy metal scene.   James hetfield also sings really well in this album and his rythm guitar work is inch perfect, his guitar work is brilliant in every song.   Kirk hammets solos are brilliant one should listen to his solos in the title track master of puppets, sanitarium and especially Leper Messiah.   Lars Ulrichs drumming is also incredible especially in Battery and disposable heroes.     We move along to the core and soul member of the band Cliff Burton, Cliff Burton quite simply was the best bass player in the heavy metal world, Metallica only produced one decent album after his death in and justice for all. Cliff burtons song writing and lead bass was one of the reasons why Metallica are where they are today. Cliff Burtons bass work in the title track Master of puppets is incredible, also his lead bass in the instrumental song that he wrote Orion is brilliant, Orion shows you what Cliff Burton was all about, His bass playing in Orion is incredible. There is a bass solo in orion by cliff which is brilliant it starts at 6:35 and finishes at 6:54 one would have to know there music to even think it is bass as its quite often mistaken for lead guitar, cliff could make his bass sound like a lead guitar he quite simply was one of a kind. The intro to Damage inc is all bass played by cliff just listen to the intro to this song and you will see why cliff burton was the best bass player ever. Cliff burtons bass on leper messiah is also incredible and  Cliff burton took bass playing to new heights and he showed that bass guitar was not just about the background in songs.     1. Battery - 19.5/20 - Dont be fooled by the acoustic intro to this song, it explodes into one of the best and fastest thrash metal songs ever. It also goes with metallicas previous opening songs to there albums with the slow openings to Hit the lights on kill em all and the brilliant fight fire with fire on Ride the lightning.    2. Master of puppets - 20/20 - Brilliant probably metallicas best ever song, crunching riffs, explosive solos and excellent bass work by Cliff.Lars ulrich plays the drums at 100 miles an hour, this song slows down during the middle and than explodes back into life. Quite simply a brilliant song. This song is about how drugs control peoples lives, the lyrics are brilliant. Metallica first played this song in concert on new years eve 1985/1986.     3. The thing that should not be - 19.5/20 - This song is very underated, it is a very good song and the lyrics are from a book by h.p lovecraft a author who had a huge influence on the band. this song is very heavy and has dark lyrics. i recommend this song and after a few times you listen to it, the song will grow on you.    4. Sanitarium - 20/20 - This song has the same sort of feel as fade to black, it starts of slow and explodes into life. Excellent lyrics. Kirk hammetts solos in this song are excellent, this song is easily in the top ten metallica songs of all time, it is a concert favourite. This is the type of song that made metallica unique in its style, just listen to this song, fade to black(ride the lightning) and one(and justice for all) and you will get the same sort of feel .    5. Disposable Heroes - 19.5/20 - this song is a thrash metal favourite and it is also the song along with the thing that should notbe that alot of people say is the weakest link to the album. This song needs to be listened to a few times but is still a very good song with excellent lyrics about soldiers going to war. Lars ulrich plays some of his best drumming work on this song.     6. Leper Messiah - 20/20 - I rate this song in the top 5 metallica songs ever made, this song is a thrash metal classic, crunching riffs, excellent solos by kirk, brilliant bass by cliff and outstanding rythm guitar work by james. The lyrics are about religion and how people use religion in the wrong ways. this is an unbelievable song and i wonder why metallica dont play this hardly ever in there concerts. This song will have you head banging and air guitaring for sure.    7. Orion - 20/20 - THIS IS THE MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE METALLICA SONG(OR INSTRUMENTAL AS ITS CALLED) EVER ALONG WITH FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS(RIDE THE LIGHTNING). THIS SONG IS WHAT CLIFF BURTON WAS ALL ABOUT, HE WROTE THIS INSTRUMENTAL AND HIS LEAD BASS IN THIS SONG IS INCREDIBLE.   kirk hammetts solos in this song are awesome. this song starts off creepy and heavy and gets faster and faster. You will think the song stops just after three minuts but than that beautiful sound of cliffs bass kicks in and starts off the slow and beautiful middle section of the song and metallica named the song orion after the middle section of the song.   This song was played at Cliff burtons funeral and if you watch the dvd cliff em all the tribute to cliff at the end has this song playing. This song will take you to another world it is an instrumental and just play this song loud and let your mind float away.   THIS INSTRUMENATL IS BRILLIANT. the call of ktulu(ride the lightning) and to live is to die(and justice for all) are excellent instrumentals as well, Cliff burton also wrote alot of the stuff in to live is to die and this song is his tribute song on and justice for all which came out after his death. If you really want to see cliff at his best listen to the song anesthesia(pulling teeth) on the album kill em all, its his bass solo, words cant explain how good that bass solo is.    8. Damage inc - 20/20 - the intro to this song is the best intro to a metal song ever, its all cliff on his bass and is such a beautiful sound. the song than crunches into mayhem and outstanding riffs and ripping solos. this song was so big when it came out that metallica named there 86/87 tour the damage inc tour. great song.     There you have it this album is a must and is easliy the best heavy metal album ever produced. The producer flemming rassmussen should be also congratulated for this album, if only metallica stuck with him than we might of seen metallica still producing albums like this today.   The death of Cliff Burton as all us real metallica fans know was the end of this once great band. Also the introduction of bob rock as there producer on the black album was the start of there downfall.   Metallica are still brilliant in concert although they have not produced a good album since and justice for all. The black album has some good songs on it but anything after that is a joke and the biggest joke is st anger. All us real Metallica fans know that this band was the best with the four horseman of james, kirk, lars and cliff. MASTER OF PUPPETS IS A MUST I RECOMMEND YOU BUY IT NOW IM STILL LISTENING TO IT 20 YEARS AFTER ITS RELEASE!!!!
0446577383|1.0|It is not right-wing versus left-wing, it is just pure anti-american.  I threw the hardcover in the trash can at my gym because I couldn't stand another page of the sentiment that America has gotten what it deserves.  Don't bother!!
B00008H2LB|4.0|This was one of the first rock albums that I ever bought, I instantly loved it, it was hard, it was angry, it was everything a teenage boy could want. But then after a while of getting into better music and starting to play music of my own, I lost interest. It didn't seem near as interesting. But then I picked this cd up again and listened to it and actually thought that it was pretty good. Yes, the guitars sound the same for the most part and lyrics are kind of childish, but I like Chester's voice and I am a fan of using a dj, though i think Incubus does it better.  <br /> <br />Overall not a bad buy if you are able to look past a few things.
B000286S8S|4.0|I stopped listening to VH after For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, which I thought was a disappointing album - indulgent and overblown.  (I loved OU812 and 5150)<br /><br />Picking up where I left off over 10 years ago - the Best of Both Worlds is a good collection to both discover and re-discover the band - minus the clunkers.<br /><br />The 3 new songs are for the most part, pretty good.  Eddie's chops are still monstrous.  However, I think Van Hagar has run its course almost, and the guys will have to dig deep down if they're going to top themselves (and if they ever re-unite).<br /><br />But back to the collection.  I agree with some reviewers that it's a schizophrenic line-up.  I stand in the Van Hagar camp more than the David Lee Roth camp - and intercutting the two tracks kinda works sometimes, and sometimes not.  Still, with the CD button - these issues are not a big deal.  Doing a chronological song line-up would've been boring.<br /><br />The main thing about hearing the two singers side by side is how Eddie's guitar - the great constant of the band - has remained the great rudder throughout even though the songs themselves hold up, and sometimes not.  Most striking is how Eddie's guitarwork (for me anyways) hits its streamlined stride once the 1984 album was produced - more polished and sophisticated.  His versatility continues to amaze and impress, even while the songwriting has not progressed in the same vein.<br /><br />I also noted that Sammy Hagar lost his variety after the OU812 album - for one reason - his bellowing voice tries to match the power of Eddie's guitar - with mixed results.  While Roth played off Van Halen's guitar rather than trying to match it - Hagar gets into a powerplay which doesn't define the melody lines that his voice brought into the band's first two Hagar era albums.<br /><br />People have criticised the band's foray into keyboards and synths.  Ironically, I think some of VH's best tracks - Jump, Dreams, Love Walks In - are absolutely made with keyboards.  And note how Hagar's voice dovetails nicely with these tracks.  Somehow, going straight ahead on the guitar path has perhaps done the boys in.<br /><br />Eddie should probably do a Joe Satriani at some point or find new collaborators to work with.  It's time.<br /><br />But enjoy this collection anyways - when all is said and done, Van Halen rocked as well as any other band on their best day.<br /><br />PS - they ignored Gary Cherone - for shame.  And yest, David Lee Roth did deserve a picture in there dammit.ks In - are absolutely made with keyboards.  And note how Hagar's voice dovetails nicely with these tracks.

B0000027RL|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite cd's. I bought it about a year ago, and I seem to like it more everytime I listen to it. My favorite tracks are, Alive, Jeremy, Why Go, Once, Evenflow, and really they're all good. The guitars are incredible on this album and the vocals are very powerful.  <br /> <br />If you haven't bought this album it is one of the best of all time, <br />5 stars.
B0002S943O|5.0|I saw DM on this tour in '93 (or'94), and the concert was GREAT.  I was not (and I'm still not) much of an alternative music fan.  However, I also saw The Cure in Austin, TX.  I have many music DVDs including Rush, Jethro Tull, and Eric Clapton.  This \\"Devotional\\" DVD gives me the emotional range that I want (or need)in a concert from the rock \\"Rush\\" to the soul-searching \\"In Your Room.\\"
0743454537|3.0|The first part of this review was written when I had just about halfway through with the book; now I've finished it and added a few more comments.  There are no spoilers in this review.<br /><br />The story has an intriguing premise: a young girl, conceived to be a tissue donor for her sister who is fatally ill with leukemia, at the age of 13 sues for medical emancipation so she can't be compelled to donate any more. The author, Jodi Picoult, has obviously done tremendous amounts of research on the medical aspects; her details lend believability to the progress and treatment of the sick sister's disease.<br /><br />Picoult tries very hard not to make any character a villain, but to bring out the point of view of each, and does a good, if slightly predictable, job of it.  Even if you had a firm opinion of this kind of \\"purposeful birth\\" situation, it's hard not to see the other points of view as you sequentially visit the minds of the various characters (interestingly, among the central family, only the ill sister's point of view isn't directly represented.)<br /><br />But the verisimilitude falls apart with the ridiculous soap-opera-ish intertwinings of the story lines.  Some of the twists sort of work in spite of being both extreme and a bit too convenient (the brother's way of acting out his issues).  Others are so far out as to almost swamp the book completely.  For example, one of the several major subplots concerns a relationship that would simply not be able to exist in a real legal case (can you say \\"conflict of interest\\"?)  In fact, the lawyer in this book would be in trouble on several levels (alone with 13-year-old female client?) if this were a true story.<br /><br />Then there are the repeated scenes with the lawyer's mysterious service dog, scenes in which someone denies the dog entrance to a building (\\"Service dog?  But you're not blind.\\") and the lawyer comes back with some inane joke (\\"I'm alcoholic.  He keeps me away from the booze.\\"), and these stupid comebacks always *work*.  In the next paragraph, we see him walking through the building with his dog.  These little vignettes are undoubtedly meant to be comic relief, but they are so unrealistic and so obviously setting us up for some melodramatic revelation later that they set my teeth on edge every time.<br /><br />It doesn't help that the mystery of the service dog is no mystery -- I'm 99.9% sure I correctly guessed the lawyer's malady within a few lines of the introduction of the dog.  And I'm pretty sure that the author is being coy about it because the lawyer's illness is going to be part of a dramatic moment later in the book regarding a failed relationship. It's all just too transparent.<br /><br />I'll update this review and admit it if I turn out to be wrong.<br /><br />Bottom line -- \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is a good read (or, in my case, a good listen) that is keeping my attention and that even provides some food for thought.  You just have to be willing to suspend a certain amount of disbelief.<br /><br />----- postscript after finishing the book ------<br /><br />That thing I said I'd update if I turned out to be wrong? Nope, I wasn't wrong.  My guesses were 100% right.  That's how tranparent that bit of story manipulation was.<br /><br />Aside from the aspects I complained about above, and without adding specific spoilers, I'll just say that now that I've finished the book I agree with some other reviewers that the ending was unworthy.  The author started with a gripping premise, began to weave a central storyline that had a reasonable amount of logical integrity, and then basically tossed it to create a certain effect.  Ultimately unsatisfying.  Some reviewers have praised this ending as \\"realistic,\\" but I strongly disagree that the final resolution represents reality, on several fronts.  You'll have to get there to see what you think.
B000002KAT|5.0|With great art like this, it is nearly pointless to analyze the quality of the songs, or the meaning of the words. Someone said this is music of a particular time - that time being the 1967-68 period when the Summer of Love turned into the Long Bad Trip. Astral Weeks transcends the time, but it's as good a guess as any that Van caught these thoughts in his net as the cloud bearing them floated by.  It is so dense, so personal, so real, that if ou pay attention you can smell the wet wool of the schoolboys' coats as they traipse in to visit Madam George.<br /><br />For an American parallel creation, check Love's Forever Changes - another particularly haunting tho much, much darker collage of impressions gathered from the collective unconscious of that time.<br /><br />Has so-called popular music produced two finer achievements since? I'm stuck as to what they might be.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City is the closest that mainstream US film has come to capturing the essence and appeal of graphic novels. <br /> <br />Visually stunning, each frame of this movie is highly stylised, no less than a work of art in itself, to closely resemble the style of the graphic novels themselves. <br /> <br />It is ultra-violent, this is Pulp Fiction on steroids, and will likely thrill or disgust those who love or hate the likes of Kill Bill. <br /> <br />I loved it. <br /> <br />It is set in the twisted environment of Sin City, part modern day, part film noir era, where among the heroes are Marv (Mickey Rourke as an ugly hulk of a man on a trail of vengeance) and Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis doing the kind of role he was made for). <br /> <br />In short, you can't take it too seriously and I find the violence totally inkeeping with the style of the movie and the work of Frank Miller. <br /> <br />It's obvious that this production has gone to pains to be faithful to its source material. Therefore to make something that didn't have comic-book action and ultra-violence would have been a real sell-out. <br /> <br />Fans of Frank Miller have been waiting a long time for a faithful translation of his work to the screen. <br /> <br />Back when Miller produced the Graphic Novel - Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, I remember people having some hope that the remake of Batman would carry some of that film noir appeal and gritty themes. <br /> <br />What did we get? Michael Keaton in a rubber suit. <br /> <br />So I don't think people griping about the level of violence in this movie is really a legitimate criticism. Like Tarantino's movies, the violence is a dramatic device, and also a vehicle for humour. <br /> <br />I watched this movie with someone who doesn't know the work of Frank Miller and has little love for screen violence, but they really appreciated the design, art and style that went into it. <br /> <br />Plus, the storylines and source material are great with plentyof twists and turns that you rarely see in mainstream US movies these days. <br /> <br />I really hope this movie will spark off sequels and other faithful adaptations of graphic novels like those from Frank Miller. <br /> <br />Just to say it again - I think Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis are outstanding in this film and are perfectly cast. <br /> <br />This movie is a triumph and hopefully sets a new standard to be matched by future productions. Highly entertaining.
B0001GMIOE|1.0|Very disappointed with this battery. I bought two batterries with my Digital Rebel and both died over the holidays. I am contacting Canon to see if there is something wrong with the batch I received and will update with any response.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|I would have rated this a zero, but apparently I can't so I must give it a one, begrudgingly mind you. I do this because the video they shot for \\"Bat Country\\" is loosley based off the film \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" (dir. Terry Gilliam, starring Johnny Depp, Benicio del Toro). If you know about the film, IT is based on the true exploits of Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. If this band that it would be a good idea to use one of the most memorable lines of this film as a song title AND THEN have the nerve to make a video for it mimicing this film, then I think Hunter's ghost should hunt them down with a Chesire cat grin on his face, toting a bag full of elicit narcotics and highly explosive materials. That's really all I have to say. If you want some real entertainment, don't buy this CD and use the money you saved to go rent \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\". Thanks.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The EAGLES is the only group that I know of that sounds just as good now as they did before.  This DVD & the previous \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" were spectacular.  It was like being there live! They don't change the lyrics/or tune like other groups that just ruin the song, but instead, keep it sounding just as good as how you remember the song, and why you liked the song. I was so bummed when we missed their Hawaii Concert, and Hawaii loves the Eagles! <br />*To all those who negatively rated these guys, GET A LIFE!, you don't need any special equipment to enjoy this DVD, at least you can understand them,relate to their music, unlike the kind you probably listen to, where you can't even understand what their saying, much less, the music isn't music it's just NOISE! <br /> <br />

B00005MAM2|4.0|As a member of a Japanese media club, I got the chance to see Akira on DVD.  What I got was something that had, as one character put it, \\"absolute energy.\\"  I was immediately enraptured by the story that unfolds in the dystopian wasteland that is Neo-Tokyo, a city built from the ashes of war.    The story starts when two main characters, Kaneda and Tetsuo, and their biker buddies hunt down the rival \\"Clown\\" gang.  The musical score that accompanies this scene (and the rest of the movie) wasn't what I expected, but it produced satisfying results.  It left me with the feeling of watching tribes in a jungle instead of gangs in a city.  Anyway, on to the characters.  From what I read from other sources, I expected Kaneda to be this streetwise, street-tough superpunk who can stick it out in the worst situations.  Instead we get this guy who puts on a \\"good boy\\" act for the cops, gets dragged to school, and wears pink.  Some of the guys and I laughed over how Kaneda's name sounds more like \\"Canada\\" in the original version.  Marlon Brando he's not, but I'm impressed by how Otomo gives us such a human character, which is the only thing that's familiar in his world.  Tetsuo, Kaneda's childhood friend, yearns to break out of his shadow.  When Tetsuo is captured by the military after an accident, he discovers telekinetic abilities he never knew he had.  And that starts a downward spiral in which Tetsuo transforms from Kaneda's \\"little brother\\" to an unstable entity.  A threat that only Kaneda, Kei (a revolutionary he saves from prison), and three wrinkly, pale-faced kid psychics can stop.    Though I was still intrigued, the film does have its problems.  First, if I had read the manga, I would go on about how all the characters in the story play more significant roles in the manga than in the movie.  Even the title character gets shortchanged (though there's only so much you can do in 124 minutes).  Otomo just needed to flesh out his characters more.  Second, blood flows likewater in this movie.  Are people just easier to kill in the future?  The ending, once I understood it, was deep and meaningful at best.  Overall, Akira was a sweet ride I wouldn't mind taking again.  Had I been able to access the DVD extras, my rating would've been higher.
0385486804|1.0|The Book Into the Wild, explains a young man's journey into the wild.  The young man's name is \\"Alex\\" or that's what we thought.  Later in the book you find out, that his name is Chris.  Well, \\"Alex's\\" journey begins when he is hitch hiking and a man named Gallien picks him up.  He then drops \\"Alex\\" off, and his journey continues.  Alex then goes through some ups and downs, but every one that has met Alex always said that he never gave up and did and work that was given to him.  People said that if he started something he would do it until it gets done.  Through out his journey he ends up stopping at Bullhead city.  He stayed there the longest, and he picks up a job at McDonalds.  His co-workers said that he was always talking about nature, animals, and about how he wanted to go to Alaska.  Well, by this time, many people were wondering if this young man was still alive, because he has been gone for so long.  Some of the men that gave Alex a ride wanted to contact him and see how he was doing.  They wrote to him, and Alex also wrote back for a little while. <br />For me this book Into the Wild was very interesting, because of the events that were happening.  It was fun to read about someone else's journey and see how he survived some of the circumstances.  There were a few things I did not like about this book, one of them was that sort of in the middle of the book it turned to talking about other people and how they're journeys relate to Alex's, so it got confusing for me to keep track of who they were talking about at certain times.  Over all it was a good, interesting book for me to read.  I recommend that you read this book if you like listening to other peoples stories and what they went through. <br />
B0000076BX|5.0|I had heard this album after their classic works. What a pity!  You should start your acquaintance with ELP from this album. Here they do it better. Smash drum beats by Palmer, dynamic keyboards playing by Emerson, emotional singing by Lake.     Of course, old fan needs 30 minutes long opuses, voice... of young Greg Lake (could anybody sing in 1992 as he sang in 1970? Pavarotti probably, but we are not in the opera, we are listening to the voice of an old rocker), depressive new \\"Tocatta-2\\", low quality recording. Do you need them?     As for me, no. I need good music. And you would get it. The first 5 songs - real classics by ELP. Rock songs (\\"Black Moon\\", \\"Paper Blood\\"), ballad \\"Affairs of the Heart\\" (reminds \\"Still... You Turn Me On\\"; co-written with Downes of Asia), great (really great!) epic insrumental by Emerson-Palmer \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (based on the theme from Prokofiev`s ballet; scene \\"Montecci and Capuletti\\"; probably the best instrumental by Emerson), another ballad \\"Farwell to Arms\\" with epic Moog solo in style of \\"Lucky Man\\". Well, album got little pop music and AOR touch, but you could beleive, if Emerson, Lake and Palmer are playing for you melodic songs - it is a high quality professional work. Music full of energy and optimism. Listen to this album as to continuation of their last record of the 1970s - \\"Love Beach\\"!  What a pity, where were no sequel to \\"Black Moon\\". The most interesting part of the next album (1994) - \\"In the Hot Seat\\" are the new version of Mussorgsky`s \\"Pictures...\\" and the cover of Dylan`s \\"Man in the Long Black Coat\\". And the mood of the album is quite dark.  Still... We are waiting for the new studio CD by ELP.    P.S. If you`d like to hear more music by Emerson and Palmer in such optimistic polished style with a little touch of pop music - try album \\"To the Power of Three\\" (1988) by Three (Emerson, Berry and Palmer).    The problem of majority of the fans is the following - once they like some albums by the performer - thenthey think the band must do the same music till death. Deep Purple must record \\"Smoke on the Water\\"-2, 3, 4, Mike Oldfield - \\"Tubular Bells\\"-5,6,7,8, ELP - \\"Tocatta\\"-9, 10, 11.  All other music - bull...t. By the way, if band would try to imitate good old sound - such fans would say that the older records were much better. If band tries to do something new - verdict of such fans is the same.  For me it seems simply boring.  So relax - and listen to good music (but try to find it for fair price)!
0393327655|2.0|I continue to press my way through this book, which is not too difficult given the author's passionate style, but alas there is more style than substance here; more bombast than carefully crafted argument. Indeed, Harris approaches his subject with a religious fervor that belies his call for an end of faith. Opting to replace religion with rationalism (nothing new in this assertion) -- Harris builds his case against religion on half truths, broad generalizations and a caricature of religious life/experience that is naive at best and intellectually dishonest at its worst.  <br /> <br />
0066620996|5.0|The author wrote a previous book entitled, \\"Built to Last.\\" That book was about how companies stay great. The book was probably interesting reading but not useful for those who are not great to begin with (I have not read it). So, he wrote this book (or rather did the study with a research team and then presented the results in the book) on companies that went from being good to being great. He found 11 companies that made the transition and the book is on what they did that made them different. <br /> <br />The book IS a research report, but it is VERY readable. It is interesting to read, and has good information that is also useful. I like the format of the book as well. <br /> <br />`Good is the enemy of great' is something I have always believed and this is the first sentence of the book. He presents five basic principles with examples and the principles behind them. Read the book to find them (or other reviews!) <br /> <br />Note that I work for a non-profit and he has recently come out with a small book applying the principles (tweaking them a little) for non-profits. It is also very worthwhile. <br /> <br />As others have mentioned the book is not perfect, but I highly recommend it as it is worth the time and can be the seeds of change to any organization.
1573225517|3.0|This quote says most of it: <br /> <br />\\"... a very funny and concise explanation of why we men are as we are. If you are male, you should read it and then make your partner read it, so they will no longer hate you but pity you instead.\\" -Harry Enfield, Independent on Sunday <br /> <br />I really do hold out hope that Rob, the main character, is not as much like every man on the face of the earth as the critics seem to think. Because if that's true, then I'm depressed. I didn't like Rob. Even though he had some moments in which I sympathized with him, and I really honestly TRIED to like him, I couldn't. I wanted to slap him. He knew he was being an idiot and went ahead and did it anyway. That's kind of unforgivable, to me. Men, if you're really like this, please just leave me in ignorant bliss.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|People who give this dvd either 5 stars or 1 star are going overboard.  Cream's performance is solidly professional but definitely at a slower speed than in their glory days.  Also, some of the camera shots (Clapton's back comes to mind) are questionable. <br /> <br />Clapton still plays very well and Baker is more than adequate.  Jack Bruce, however, looked like a man who was physically pressed to his absolute limit.  Bruce didn't smile for a total of 10 seconds during the entire dvd but, like the pro he is, made it to the end.  So, I would say that Clapton and Baker could both have played more energetically and at faster tempos, but Bruce could not have kept up. <br /> <br />If you're not expecting more than the guys can deliver, you will find this to be a very entertaining concert video.
B00000IQV7|3.0|Liked the movie, but wanted to say if you are buying for the commentary its not great. Or i should say it is difficult to listen to. They did not lower the movie sound low enough to hear what the director is saying and that makes to very hard to concentrate on what he is saying.
0887308589|5.0|Although in a lot of cases reality is much more bizar, Mr. Adams knows exactly what is going on in 99 percent of all companies (excluding mine, obviously ;-)
B0007LXPBI|3.0|A couple get divorced (for no good reason that is ever explained)and decide to each take one of their twin daughters with them - so as never to have to communicate with each other again. Subsequently, both parents appear to forget they ever had a second child, never bother to tell either twin that the other exists or discuss with them their missing parent. That is the ridiculous premise upon which The Parent Trap is built. And this, one reviewer described as \\"good, clean family fun\\"? Good clean dysfunctional family fun, perhaps. <br /> <br />If you can get beyond the glaring flaws in the plot you'll be impressed by the cast. Lindsay Lohan is exceptional. Even her English accent is flawless - pretty amazing for an actress of any age never mind one of eleven! And it is especially commendable as it is the only accurate reference to England and the English in the entire film. <br /> <br />Example? \\"Oreos\\" are neither marketed nor sold in England to the best of my knowledge so when Halle/Annie both claim to have always enjoyed eating them with peanut butter it just comes across as clumsy product placement. But then again, Disney's chocolate box version of London only exists in the mind of people who've never visited it. <br /> <br />Annie's relationship with her \\"Butler\\" is too intimate for a professional relationship and their handshake ritual is, frankly, ridiculous. As is the pairing of said camp butler with butch nanny in the romance stakes. <br /> <br />An odd film, not badly made but still odd. It trivializes divorce and its repercussions in the context of a family entertainment. A contradiction in terms, me thinks. In the real world, parents like these should have been \\"trapped\\" by social services but that would hardly make for Disney entertainment, would it?!  <br /> <br />A bit of a pointless exercise remaking it any way as the original - with the fabulous Haley Mills - could hardly be bettered. <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What happened to the original thinkers in TV ? What happened to \\"Must see TV\\" ?  This series and subsequent movie are absolute proof that the creativity we have lost in Network TV is still out there, but is being quashed by Network Execs that are undeniably out of touch with its viewers. If the networks do decide to run a series people want to watch they run it for a few months then kill production to run another series all together like its impossible to have two good shows at the same time on the same network or they find ONE good idea and run two more identical shows with only slightly diffrent names. Even Hollywood seems more than happy to churn out remake after remake of 50 year old ideas. Don't get me wrong I enjoy watching giant apes swat airplanes, orange Dodge Chargers flying thru the air and the science it takes to lift a print from a glass as much as the next guy, but if they make it common practice to cancel shows with this much promise because they can't compete with a sports franchise or a show in its fifth year, 50 years from now they will STILL be remaking Giant Apes, orange Dodge Chargers and showing for the 100 millionth time that they can get dna with a cotton swab.  <br /> <br />I had not heard of the Firefly series until I heard about Serenity since this is on dvd I highly suggest watching both the series and the movie. Serenity doesn't rely on Firefly but it does carry on where the series left off with just enough retold history to keep it self contained.
B000002MP2|5.0|Wow, what can i say... I got this c.d. today & I was very, very impressed with most of the songs. This is probably 1 of Green Day's top albums they've ever made! The most well-known and favorite songs that i like on here are: Longview, Welcome To Paradise, Burnout, Pulling Teeth, Basket Case, She and When I Come Around. I really hope they don't quit their music career 'cause they've been doing a SUPER job on all the albums... GO GREEN DAY! <br />
B00005JO04|2.0|SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW <br />Based off of the zillions of good reviews that this movie got by the critics and all of the hype and big expectations coming into it, this movie was a major dissapointment. Don't trust the critics.  <br />First off, this movie has a strong cast. Matt Damon, Amanda Peet, George Clooney, William Hurt and Chris Cooper are all in it. But none of them give great performances. I have to say that Clonney gives the best of the pack. The rest of them are emotionless and ultimately dissapointing. William Hurt, one of the finest American actors is in the movie for 2 minutes. And this left me thinking: what the hell is going on? Why is he even in it? This is ridiculous! <br />The movie's plot centers around oil but there are so many sub plots that your head will spin. Now, the movie isn't hard to follow, I understood what was going on but there was no need for all of these sub plots. The movie couldn't pick a topic..no it had to pick 50 and jam them into one movie. That is ridiculous. All of the characters are underdeveloped. ALL OF THEM.  <br />Matt Damon and Amanda Peet. WOW. What the heck was the point of one of their sons dying? It's just thrown in there, so very randomly. Why? To add more drama? That made the movie out as a soap opra!  <br />Jeffrey Wright is very dissapointing. No emotion at all. Absolutely none. And what is up with his father? Why is his character's father in the movie? Their relationship also isn't shown. When the father flips him off, why? <br />George Clooney is married with a kid. What is happening with their relationships? Why is the kid so mad at him?  <br />His character is lame. Why does he take getting his nails pulled off? Or should I say RIPPED off? He acts like he doesn't care about it.  <br /> <br />And for me, a simple movie buff, this overcomplicated plot with too many characters and too many locations wasn't my cup of tea. Sure if you're some historian, it may be more interesting.  <br />George Clooney is on thescreen for 5 minutes in Iran, then BAM, we're in Texas with Chris Cooper, them BAM in Washington D.C. with Jeffrey Wright then BAM back in Iran. That is how the movie follows and quite frankly, that gives me a headache. And the shift between subtitles and none, WOW. TALK ABOUT GETTING A HEADACHE.  <br />But if you want to get a headache, check this out. The movie had interesting points but couldn't pick one and in the end was a soap opra and we were supposed to feel bad for Clooney and Damon. Well, I didn't. BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T DEVELOPPED!  <br />SO DISSAPOINTING. Oh, and yeah, the movie is boring too.
B00004YW6I|5.0|In 1974, rock legend Joni Mitchell released \\"Court And Spark,\\" a timeless masterwork of love and life that silenced every critic that doubted her before that point. With enough soul and stamina to be a rock record but at times catchy enough to be pop, the lush execution and ambitious drive of the record was undeniable. That's how I've always seen PJ Harvey's \\"Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea.\\"    This really is an amazing album. The theme is executed flawlessly and the instruments are effortlessly perfect. The tones vary greatly, from the rock and roll panic of \\"Kamikaze\\" to the dreary and subdued \\"Horses In My Dreams.\\" There is something for everyone. Some say this is her best album, and that is arguable I guess, but it certainly is the album that showed she no longer had anything to prove. Brilliant.
B000000W5H|5.0|This so far is my favorite ROLLING STONES album.  Unfortunately, it is also the last album with lead and slide guitarist MICK TAYLOR whose rhythm and blues style kept THE STONES rollin' after the 1969 departure and death of  guitarist BRIAN JONES.  IF YOU CAN'T ROCK ME is an outstanding beginner for this album.  The intro of the drums by CHARLIE WATTS, rhythm guitar riffs by KEITH RICHARDS, the bluesy lead guitar solo by MICK (also throughout the song), and the bass guitar riffs by BILL WYMAN starts the album off with a outstanding kick and then kicks into overdrive with MICK JAGGER'S lead vocal, KEITH'S harmony vocal, and clavinet by solo artist BILLY PRESTON.  The remake of the MOTOWN hit AIN'T TOO PROUD TO BEG is an excellent rockin' song with the drums, bass guitar riffs, guitar riffs (including solos by MICK TAYLOR), vocals by MICK JAGGER and KEITH, and keyboards by BILLY.  The title track is excellent with MICK TAYLOR'S overdriven guitar riffs, the acoustic guitar, rhythm guitar riffs by KEITH, bass guitar riffs, drums, vocals, and piano by IAN STEWARD.  TILL THE NEXT GOODBYE is an excellent acoustic ballad with the acoustic guitar, MICK TAYLOR'S bluesy slide guitar, vocals, and piano by NICKY HOPKINS.  Now comes the highlight of the album called TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE that has a oustanding introduction.  This is also my most favorite ROLLING STONE song ever, but then there is also their similar sounding 1981 hit WAITING ON A FRIEND from TATTOO YOU.  Anyway, TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE features excellent piano riffs by NICKY, the synthesizer by either BIIL or MICK TAYLOR, bass guitar riffs, the acoustic and rhythm guitar, drums, lead vocal by MICK JAGGER, and harmony vocal by KEITH. More importantly, the highlight of this song is the signature bluesy guitar solo played by MICK TAYLOR, which happens to be his best yet.  LUXURY is an excellent song that features excellent guitar riffs by KEITH and MICK TAYLOR, vocal, drumsand piano by IAN.  I just do not understand whythere is no bass guitar.  DANCE LITTLE SISTER is an outstanding past paced rocker that kicks the album into overdrive.  It features excellent rhythm guitar riffs by KEITH, electrifying lead guitar by MICK, bass guitar riffs, piano by IAN, drums, and vocals.  Plus, it sounds similar to RESPECTABLE from the 1978 album SOME GIRLS that also features SHATTERED (the funniest song I thought they ever recorded).  IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE MY FRIEND is another excellent ballad with the acoustic and leslie guitar riffs, piano by NICKY and lead vocal by MICK JAGGER.  Plus, MICK TAYLOR delivers an excellent lead guitar solo that enlightens this song, but I think they could have harmony vocals by the band instead of the gospel BLUE MAGIC.  SHORT AND CURLIES has an excellent piano intro by IAN, vocals, drums, guitar and bass guitar riffs, drums; however, beware of a possible offensive phrase at the beginning of this song and throughout.  FINGERPRINT is an excellent closer for the album.  It features excellent guitar riffs that sounds like they were played on a FENDER STRATOCASTER, vocals, drums, bass guitar riffs, keyboards by BILLY, and lead guitar by MICK TAYLOR.  However, KEITH not singing lead vocal on this album is unfortunate and I do not like the sound of BILL'S bass guitar, despite his excellent style.  After this album and the departure of MICK TAYLOR who should have had songwriting credits, as BILL and CHARLIE, and the arrival of THE FACES' RON WOOD, the band's style of music began to change, especially with dicso around the corner in 1976.  Meanwhile, the replica of the album covers and liner notes match the original artwork of the album and this 1974 alubm is definitely a must have for all ROLLING STONE fans.
B00005NGAL|5.0|I first saw a local stage production of the musical and thought it was brilliant. A few months later, I bought the DVD. <br /> <br />The DVD version (unlike that of Phantom of the Opera) doesn't try to be a full-blown movie. It's set on the stage at the Adelphi Theatre. The best of the best of the London and Broadway productions were put into this movie. I felt that the casting choices were great. <br /> <br />I'm not going to say that it was absolutely perfect because nothing is. It was pretty darn good, though. Sure, there was some poor editing, but what can you expect from a movie? There's always going to be poor editing and problems with the a/v synchronization. <br /> <br />As far as the music goes, I'd recommend finding a friend who has the soundtrack and borrowing it from them so you can first familiarize yourself with the music. If you then decide to watch the dvd, keep the lyrics on hand in case you don't understand the words. <br /> <br />In closing, you will either love it or hate it. I personally loved it and recommend it, but it's not for everyone.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet was based on Shakespeare's The Tempest.  Well, saying that Forbidden Planet was based on The Tempest is like saying Silver Streak was based on Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.  It would be better to say Forbidden Planet was inspired by The Tempest. <br /> <br />Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) headed a doomed scientific party twenty years prior to the planet Altair-4.  A rescue party has been sent to find their fate.  It is headed by the dashing Captain Adams (Leslie Nielsen - yes at one time Leslie was dashing.)  Morbius warns off Adams but Adams is determined to find out the fate of the expedition. <br /> <br />Morbius tells him that all died from a strange monster, all except he and his wife.  Oh and his beautiful daughter, Altaira (Anne Francis).  The entire crew falls for Altaira including the Captain.  Little by little the secrets of the planet, its extinct race, the Krells, and the monster are revealed.  We also have the first famous robot, Robbie, the Robot.   <br /> <br />Pidgeon is most famous for his series of films with Greer Garson, including the Oscar winner Mrs. Miniver.  But when she retired, so did his career (and that was a shame as he is a great actor).  This was a chance for him to headline a film.  He created a niche for himself that would give him quality films until he retired.  By the way he reunited with Anne Francis, sort of, in Funny Girl. <br /> <br />The rest of the cast was up and comers.  Most found their success in television.  Anne Francis became Honey West.  Leslie Nielsen is most associated with Police Squad.  Jack Kelly was one of the Mavericks.  Richard Anderson was the boss of The Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman.  Earl Holliman was boss to Police Woman.  James Drury was The Virginian.  So as you can see, there are a lot of familiar faces here. <br /> <br />The production quality is a bit cheesy but this was really the first true outer space film and you have to forgive this.  The sets are great but they look like sets.  By today's standards, the visual effect are bland but you have to take it for the time that this was made.  The effects were state of the are for the 50's and extremely clean.  They blend very well with the scene, they do not look at all fake. <br /> <br />As stated before, this is inspired by The Tempest.  The Tempest is on of my favorite Shakespeare plays but it is seldom staged and it has only been filmed for television.  It would increase your enjoyment of the film to see The Tempest. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />
B000BOH8XW|5.0|This Album Totaly Rocks! I tought \\"Don't Bother\\" was Going to be the best song...... guess what? NOT.. I was wrong!! It's just amazing to hears songs like \\"How Do You Do\\" and its gregorian choir. I'm truly not a Fan of Laundry Service at all. Laundry Service was Shakira's \\"Britney Alike Album\\" its just not my type. but the true shakira is back! If you like Real artist such as The Cure, The Cranberries, Courtney Love,Petula Clark...I recommend you this album.. It's a Masterpiece...Shakira has grown as a Women but also as a True Artist and not a POP tart.... I also recommend you \\"Donde estan Los Ladrones\\" & \\"pies Decalzos\\".... even tho i dont Understand a thing in spanish... the music is great! <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a film that will continue to be successful long after its disappointing theatrical run.  A poor marketing campaign and ill-advised release date tanked it in theaters, but on DVD and later television, even the uninitiated will find a remarkably tight and always engaging adventure title.  Calling it sci-fi is accurate but misleading: if the techno-babble of Star Trek or the cartoonish nature of the new Star Wars films bothers you, don't fret - Serenity if refreshingly devoid of such genre trappings.  It's energy and vibe is much more akin to the ORIGINAL 1977 Star Wars, where it squeezes every bit of WOW that it can from each frame, and nothing feels bloated, self-indulgent, or in need of editing.  Years from now Serenity will hopefully be only the first in a franchise of films revolving around these engaging characters, and we'll remember how the evolving home market has revolutionized what we think of as \\"a hit.\\"    **EDIT** I just picked up the Blu Ray version to replace my DVD, and while the quality is definitely better than the DVD, it is not so much so that I think an upgrade is crucial. This may not be the case, however, depending on your set-up, particularly with the audio. I have a 3-way soundbar rather than surround, and to me, the sound (esp dialogue) seemed too bright, too crisp, and almost made it seem like a lot of the dialogue was looped (re-recorded in post). The audio compression seemed off too, with sound effects being WAY louder than the dialogue. Having a proper surround system may make these issues moot, though.    Visually, the movie tends to be very dark, so it doesn't really show off the HD - however this is an aesthetic choice on the filmmakers part and it works for the story, just don't expect crystal clear imagery when they're indoors. In outdoor/outer space environments, the HD is much more apparent, and here the film looks much better than the DVD. The final space battle has never looked more brilliant.    Overall, the film is fantastic, regardless of the format. If you don't own it, the blu ray is probably superior, but if you have the DVD, it's a judgment call.      Can't stop the signal!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|While I have from time to time been impressed with a show, rarely have I truly 'fallen in love' with one.  Yet such is the case with \\"Firefly.\\"  What a magnificent work it is...what a \\"shiny\\" gem!  There isn't a character with whom you don't connect on some level.  The entire mood and feel of the show pulls you in and (thankfully) won't let go.  Its unforgiveable and untimely cancellation is yet another case in point that TV executives must be chosen more for what they lack than for what they possess.  And what they lack is vision, heart, patience, intelligence, individuality, depth, complexity,humanity,and integrity...everything that can be found in \\"Firefly\\" and its characters in abundance.  Maybe that's why they cancelled it...they looked bad by comparison. <br />Buy this series.  Buy the movie \\"Serenity.\\"  The only thing you'll regret is the fact that the story ends and that it took us this long to 'get it.'
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I gotta say it. 100% of titanic fans had waited for this fully-equipped DVD since the original movie released. Inside the DVD has everything I love: complete behind-the-scene, deleted scenes, and the alternate ending. Plus a dozen supreme features that gonna blow everyone into total entertainment. The \\"POD Behind the Scenes branching option\\" and the \\"1912 Newsreel\\", MUST SEE~
B00003CXCT|4.0|Like a lot of other people, I found the addition of Greedo's shooting at Han first rather annoying, though they seemed almost simultaneous, so I just tell myself it was Han's laser blast richocheting off the wall.<br /><br />Anyhow, the picture quality is vastly improved, there are a few extra scenes with CGI that were impossible back in 1977-1983, and it's widescreen! If nothing else, at least you don't have to wait five seconds before you can read the entire first line of the opening STAR WARS scrolling script.<br /><br />The bonus material is great. You learn a great many things... like, they used potatoes for some of the far meteors, Harrison Ford (Han Solo) wanted to be killed off in the third movie, George Lucas was so stressed he went to the hospital, the Title of Return of The Jedi was changed at the last minute, and much more.<br /><br />You also learn of the struggle behind the production of Star Wars, earn more respect for Mark Hammel's performance, and there is a great deal of running commentary by all of the still-living actors. The man who played Chewbacca is 7'3\\"! And yes, he speaks. C-3PO's actor is quite funny, and then of course there's R2-D2's..
B0007GAERG|5.0|Wow, if it isn't obvious that school is out for winter break from the last few pages of reviews, I don't know what is.  Last time I checked this was a place to review Mariah's latest album, not compare her to Madonna.  One tip to our younger reviewers out there.  If you want to critique someone's singing style or vocal ability, you may not want to stoop to the 5th grade level insults about weight and appearance.  Children's hour is over, go listen to a Madonna album, or better yet study a little more to improve your spelling, goodness knows some of you need it.   <br /> <br />Ok, enough of that, let's get onto Emancipation of Mimi and Mariah Carey.  I have to say I was rather impressed with Mariah's latest offering.  I have had an on again, off again appreciation of her music of late but found this album to be fairly refreshing.  There are a number of really good cuts on this album starting with the obvious singles that have already been released as well as some of the other cuts as well.  It is good to know that Mariah still has the voice we all grew to appreciate.  Like her high pitched notes or not, it requires a real talent to hit them.  And that talent seems to be lost on  many of our 'Madonna' fans here who seemingly have no understanding of strong vocal abilities.   <br /> <br />I am glad I added Emancipation to my CD collection.  And just to make it clear, I also do have an appreciation of Madonna's work as well.  She is an entertainer, that is for sure, but her vocal ability in no way compares to the likes of Mariah or others in her realm.  I mean come on, if you have to release a sex book to get fame, that speaks volumes. <br /> <br />Guess I should leave off here and go listen to Madonna's latest album to see what I am missing.
B000002IOJ|5.0|Testament may not have invented thrash metal, but they are still a very underrated band. The musicians in Testament are equally as talented as anybody in thrash's Big Four bands (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax), and they are more hook oriented than many speed metal bands. Lead guitarist Alex Skolnick's solos are a lot more technical than Slayer's, and are usually every bit as breathtaking as Metallica's. The guitar shredding on Testament's third studio album, \\"Practice What You Preach\\" (which was released in 1989), is, of course, no exception. Even when the rest of the band (especially the drummer) sounds somewhat generic, Skolnick soars on every track with fiery, blowtorch riffs and wonderful solos. \\"Time Is Coming\\" and the title track are both catchy numbers with chugging riffs, thumping drums, and vocals which almost echo James Hatfield (plus \\"Practice What You Preach\\" has a shout a long of \\"preach!\\" in the chorus.) These songs are also both capped off by a lengthy, wailing guitar solo. Likewise, \\"Perilous Nation\\" features up and down, classical-sounding guitar work, \\"Envy Life\\" has an ascending solo, and \\"Sins of Omission\\" is highlighted by another superb, very complex solo which has several different parts to it. Other standout tracks include \\"The Ballad\\" and the instrumental (albeit brief) album closer, \\"Confusion Fusion.\\" The former track, \\"The Ballad,\\" kind of sounds like Metallica's 1986 single, \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium),\\" because it begins as a power ballad with acoustic plunking, but it gradually builds and gains momentum. Over the years, this album has taken a slight dip in sound quality, but it has aged better than some of the music from the Eighties. Testament may not be as iconic as some thrash bands, but albums like \\"Practice What You Preach\\" prove that they definitely should be. This is another great, must-own album from one of thrash's most important, most underrated, and finest bands.
B000BYRCH4|5.0|Awesome movie! Don't listen to the critics who said this movie was bad. Fans of 'The Deep' will definitely like Into The Blue. It's very simular but with more action, adventure, and comedy. Paul Walker, Jessica Alba, and Scott Caan make a great on-screen team. Extras on the dvd are great too because you can see the making of the movie. Great action flick! Buy it.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|Some slam bang action and some reality-testing scenarios offer some color. But Matt McConaghey is young, sexy, long haired and not nearly sophisticated enough to play Dirk Pitt. Penelope Cruz, like Katie Holmes, is experienced, pleasant to look at, and eager to please, but perhaps she should stick to Spanish-language films. These are two pretty people but there is no chemistry. Sidekick Steve Zahn is a comic book character and the second Pitt sidekick, Al Giardino, is played by the actor with the same gusto he brings to his current role as the ubergeek in NBC's knockoff, \\"The Office\\". <br /> <br />The most interesting part of the film is, per Cussler's standard approach, the fictional historic event that sets off the search for a Confederate ironclad in the middle of the Nigerian desert. The viewer feels more connected with the doomed sailors in their few minutes on screen at the onset than with the rest of the characters in the next two hours. Director Doug Liman pans ever so slowly over the interior of one of Pitt's exploration vessels, trying to create some sense of context or history, through photos, technology, high-tech gear, and other visual aids, but there is no real connection or explanation to be had unless you are a fan of the genre or have read the novel. <br /> <br />It may be that Cussler does not translate well onto the screen. It might also be that I've grown bored with Cussler after reading more than six of his novels. They do become a bit predictable while outlandish, cartoonish, and two-dimensional, just like this film.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|I love this movie but I am however upset like some of you that \\"When Love Is Gone\\" has been cut. It is however in the full screen version of the DVD but not in the widescreen. Doesn't really make much sense to me but it's there still the same. The movie looks great and Michael Caine does an awesome job as Scrooge. The music is amazing and the muppet performers really did an awesome job on this film. It brings me to tears everytime I watch it.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|To be honest, my favorite part was the beautiful video 'The Blower's Daughter' by Damien Rice and Lisa Hannigan, in the Special Features... <br /> <br />Closer is a movie that just doesn't live up to the premise or the potential generated by such an outstanding cast. While it plays with contrasting the Apollonian versus Dionysian energies of the two male characters, and the interplay of the scattered energies that the colliding relationships create, it somehow falls short of working, for me. <br /> <br />Yes, it's about the futility of obsession, as was Lolita, and the underlying purity of Natalie Portman's character hints at a tip of the literary hat to Goethe's Faust, but Closer never settles into a believable flow. <br /> <br />As far as the plot goes, Jude Law's Dan actually has the chance to be happy with both women at different times, but blows it by obsessing over details and control issues. So does the Sleazy Doc, but in a different way. <br /> <br />Life is not about 'cheat but don't tell', it's about 'don't cheat', as Portman's Alice/Jane rightly suggested - that there is always a pivotal moment when you can stop yourself from falling in love inappropriately or creating an inappropriate  sexual liaison. <br /> <br />Just be glad you are not inside their heads.
B00005JOHU|3.0|The theme of the film - international arms dealer -- is a very serious one, but unfortunately it was too much for writer/director Andrew Niccol. `Lord of War' claims that the content is based on the actual events, but the important thing is - What part of it? <br /> <br />I believe that there is a man like Yuri, Ukrainian-born arms dealer, who finds his unexpected `gift' as gunrunner. The deadpan acting of Nicholas Cage as Yuri makes this fellow more credible than the overwritten script allows for him. Actually, the most intriguing moments of the film come when we see him as businessman whose cool and non-committal attitudes towards politics and moral are curiously attractive. Or repulsive to some of you. <br /> <br />And I believe that even this so-called `Death-Merchant' can be a good father, love his wife, and care his drug-addicted brother (Jared Leto). If Andre Niccol says that he actually met the real-life arms dealers, and that he thought them nice people, there is no reason I should not believe what he says. And you will see at the same time that Yuri can sell guns right in front of the possible victims who are going to be killed, and that complexity in his characters makes him all the more intriguing. <br /> <br />However, the rest of the film is overloaded with clichd items, none of which have a ring of truth. How many times should I write that Interpol (ICPO) never send the investigator (here played by Ethan Hawke)? They may send to or receive the information from each country's police around the world, but never investigate themselves. Or how many times should we see the romance with a beautiful woman when we don't need it? Yuri gets his dream woman Ava (Bridget Moynahan) only to disappoint her. Yuri's brother gets what you know he will get when he reappears in the second half of the film, and so does Yuri's rival in business (Ian Holm). In spite of the good acting, these supporting roles only lessen the reality that the film is supposed to have. <br /><br />The film's weakness can be easily ignored if `Lord of War' is meant to be something entirely fictional. It is not, and the character of Yuri convinces you of the fact. But the film remains uneven, even has a scattershot appearance though the central character hits the target.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|This album totally ROCKS!!  We have missed KoRn for some time now and they have re-emerged (minus one guitarist) as strong as ever.  This album takes us back to their earlier albums, yet, with a twist.  KoRn has, in a slight way, reinvented itself and for the better. This is a thoroughly enjoyable CD to listen to and I applaud the band for contiuing on making GREAT music even after the loss of their founding member.  CONGRATULATIONS!!

A powerful read...and you must follow up with his second book \\"My Friend Leonard\\"....even better than the first!!!
B0007O38F8|1.0|The massacre is a massacre to my ears. This is just bubble gum rap. 100% trash and not one song was good. When I first heard candy shop i knew this was gonna be bad but not that bad. Gay Unit, I mean G-Unit has fallen off thanks to 50 cent. I mean what the hell is Baltimore Love thing that is just pure bullsh*t. This guy has gone soft just like Ja Rule. Piggy Bank why would he go out and diss all the good MC's. He's stupid you knew Jada was gonna Lyrically shred him when he heard this song. every track is just a skip. I'm pissed that I spent $15 on this crap.
1594200653|4.0|\\"Postwar\\" is a terrific general overview for someone like me with no particular background in the subject, and I definitely recommend it for that purpose.  Now for the bad news: Other reviewers have bemoaned the lack of footnotes, and I completely agree.  Worse than that, though, is the book's incomplete indexing--any number of names, places, and events are listed incompletely, or not at all.  (The book's introduction gives a website address which links to a long list of book titles, but without saying which parts of Postwar are indebted to which books.)  Also, there are a fair number of typos throughout the book, enough to make me wonder, given the dismal index, whether this book was rushed to press at the expense of a final editorial going-over.  Even given the above gripes, though, I enjoyed Postwar enough to go find and read some of the author's other books--I hope they'll be as interesting and informative as this one.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|This movie is excellent.I enjoyed the horror moments and the trial moments.I felt this movie not only scares you but inspires you to think about life yourself.I thought the acting,production and story was top notch.I think if you are a believer(I am)in god this movie will get to you a lot more if you write this story off as made up.I feel there is a lot of evidence to support this story and how you interpret it is up to you.This movie has and will continue to cause a lot of discussion over the subject of demonic posession.I believe there is such a thing and so this movie really got to me.I watch horror movies all the time and this one belongs up there with the best of them.Get this movie,it delivers chills and it also provides much to ponder.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I've been a fan of Shakira for awhile, and I have to say this album certainly doesn't disappoint. Her voice and the lyrics are just as rich and poignant as ever, and she really shows her range on this album. Whether you're into pop, rock, or raggaeton, you'll find something to love about this CD. <br /> <br />Favorites: <br />\\"No\\", \\"Las de la Intuicion\\" (pop feel to it), \\"En Tus Pupiles\\", and \\"Dia Especial\\"  <br /> <br />Songs to skip: <br />\\"Escondite Ingles,\\"Para Obtener un Si\\" <br /> <br />WARNING: This CD is very addictive.
0440241588|3.0|If you like books by John Grisham you should read The Broker.  It was not my favorite of John's books but it was worth the read.  An interesting story that gets you from the beginning and pulls you into the book!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I love this movie.  I think I must have watched it a dozen times already between the DVD and the movie channels.<br /><br />I think it's hilarious from start to finish with a perfect cast, great soundtrack and memorable lines from the main character.  Also, the interaction between Napoleon and Uncle Rico keeps me laughing my butt off every time I watch it.<br /><br />I can see how some people may think it's 'lame'.  It's not the kind of 'stand up' comedy movies you see nowadays.  I guess some people need to be hit over the head with humour to enjoy a comedy?<br /><br />Roger Ebert has said we feel sorry for the characters?  I totally disagree.  I love the characters and accepted them for who they are, where they lived and all their idiosyncracies.  Plus, you'll be too busy laughing to feel sorry for any of them.
158234082X|4.0|I enjoyed nearly every line of this book. His practical advice, insights into the mind of chefs and cooks, and his wry take on thw world in general make this a great read. I heartily recommend it.
B000AYEIZY|4.0|In the most unlikeliest of reunions, Cream got back together in 2005 to play a series of shows at the Royal Albert Hall, the site where it all ended 37 years earlier.  In their heyday, the band played with an intensity and improvisation seldom heard in music before or since as Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce, and Eric Clapton battled for top billing with their over the top performances. However, Eric is clearly the star of the show now as his vocals and guitar work are in fine form on \\"Outside Woman Blues\\", \\"Badge\\", and \\"Crossroads\\" and his fiery solos are even more impressive on the blues numbers \\"Stormy Monday\\", \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\", and \\"Sleepy Time Time.\\"  Even if they don't touch the versions from the Live Cream releases, the songs \\"N.S.U.\\", \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", and \\"Sweet Wine\\" are all very strong.  Jack can't hit the high notes like he used to, which may be why tracks like \\"Swalbr\\" and \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" are noticeably absent. However, his bass playing is still solid as exhibited on \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\" and \\"I'm So Glad\\" and he still plays a mean harmonica on \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'.\\" And while Ginger plays it straight for the majority of the album, his drumming is downright monstrous on \\"Toad.\\" Other tracks like \\"White Room\\", \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\", and \\"We're Going Wrong\\" are okay but were actually better in their studio versions. Also worth noting is that this is just Cream and their music. This isn't like the Rolling Stones or the Who, both of whose live shows of the last several years have been beefed up with several backing musicians and vocalists. If you expect the high energy of the second disc of Wheels of Fire or their other live albums, you will likely be disappointed. However, Royal Albert Hall: London May 2-3-5-6 2005 proves that Cream are still a solid live band and sound quite vital for three guys in their sixties.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The crew of Serenity return in a performance that quickly draws you into a story of a crew that is more family than a collection of strangers.  Space isn't always clean, happy with perfect machines that never fail.  I believe space will follow this vision more than any Trek or Saga you will find.  Sit back and enjoy a wonderful adventure. <br />Most of family seen the movie on the big screen.  We watched again over Christmas holiday together.  Serenity is a great return of a story and a powerful cast with a very special magic.  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an adventure that doesn't always go as planned.  I hope you enjoy this as much as we do. <br />I want to thank you all for allowing Serenity to return for a special big screen adventure.  I will hope many returns of the Serenity crew.   <br /> <br />
B00005JNX0|5.0|If you have not purchased this movie for your home library then I suggest you do so. All the way up to the release of the movie, my children kept talking about it and I had no idea what they were talking about! They went to see the movie in the theater and once it came out on DVD my wife purchased it. I finally got to see the movie and ever since then we have probably watch this movie at least 2-3 times a week and it never gets old. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it for any parent to sit and watch it with your children.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|With his sharp, hawklike features and piercing eyes, Richard Armitage (Cold Feet ser. 5), gives a breathtaking perfomance in what is doubtless to become his signature role as the stern, powerful, proud cotton-mill owner, John Thornton, in this splendid four-part 2004 adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's turbulent 1855 novel, North & South.   <br /> <br />Margaret Hale is a beautiful young woman who has been a part of London society and who \\"hales\\" from an Edenic village in the South of England--a part of the world where life moves at a slower pace, untainted by the filth, over-crowding, anonymity, and abject poverty which was a by-product of the industrial revolution in the North.  Her life is turned upside down, however, when her father, a local vicar, suffers a crisis of faith which results in him leaving the church and uprooting his family to the dreary, smoky, northern industrial town of Milton where he hopes to eke out a living as a tutor.   <br /> <br />Margaret is disgusted by all she sees in this new, foreign place which is unlike anything she has ever known.  She lays the fault for the appalling social conditions at the feet of the industrialists--the \\"masters\\"--towards whom she betrays an almost instant prejudice.  The industrialist who bears the brunt of Margaret's antagonism and criticism is John Thornton, a pupil and friend of her father's.  <br /> <br />The central story revolves around the antagonistic relationship between these two characters, and it is hard not to make comparisons with Austen's Pride & Prejudice.  Though he's a hard-working industrialist rather than an idle, landed gentleman, Thornton is very similar to Darcy, as much for his serious, stern, brooding nature as for his integrity and strength of character.  Also like Darcy, he falls desperately in love--despite himself--with a strong-willed, proud, outspoken, intelligent young woman who spurns his love and sends him off with his tail between his legs.  Like the aloof, prejudiced Elizabeth Bennet, it is only after spurning her would-be lover that Margaret Hale comes to realize just what sort of man she has rejected.  That said, I will say no more regarding their relationship, as I don't wish to spoil the story for those unfamiliar. <br /> <br />North & South also deals with the working and living conditions of the mill workers and with the labour unions of the time.  We see the union from the perspective of both the masters and the workers, but we also see tension within the ranks of the workers.  Solidarity is the foundation upon which the union gets its strength, but we are forced to question the justification of the union's tyrannical enforcement of it when we see cruel harships befall certain individuals as a result.  <br /> <br />Dvd extras include deleted scenes and an interesting 15-minute interview with Richard Armitage.  Text-based extras include interesting production notes and \\"bios\\" of 5 of the main actors, which consist of little in the way of biography and are mostly comments about themselves and their roles!  There is also a commentary on episodes 1 & 4. <br /> <br />North & South is a powerful, passionate, beautiful story (not to mention rivetting--I initially watched it on television, and rarely have I seen a show in which it was SO hard to wait for the next episode).  The acting is flawless and the production values unsurpassed, which result in a visually stunning, rich, dynamic presentation.  I have no hesitation in saying that this is one of the best dramas (period or otherwise) produced by the BBC in a very long time.  It will be a special treat for anyone with a penchant for period productions; as for those who enjoyed 1995's Pride & Prejudice, it is absolutely a must see!  In short, this is one mini-series which I cannot praise highly enough, and I recommend it unreservedly to anyone looking for top quality dramatic entertainment.  <br />
B00005JMAH|4.0|Now the movie was very true to the book and I appreciate that.<br />I reccomend watching the DVD extras too, It did give mo more appreciation for the movie and other areas I hadnt put as much thought into.  The Special effects were awesome.  I wasnt sold on the dementers being true to book, but that is personal preference, also they show the \\"mouth\\" of one on the train in the beginning which seems a conflict of what I remember from the book, I could be wrong though.  I loved the backdrop and getting to know more of hogwarts from the outside (DVD extras helped me appreciate that more)<br /> My really only complaint is that they left too much out from the book IMO...  I can MAYBE understand cutting the length for theatre purposes, but with a strong committed fan based such as HP has I dont think it would a huge risk to make it longer.  I do understand as stated in some of the DVD extras, that it would have to be \\"16 hours\\" LOL to be REALLY true to the book.<br />I can help but WISH at some point they WILL release these movies in a DVD version that is longer, quite a bit longer and contains more of what they had to leave onthe cutting room floor.<br />Dont read beyond if you dont want to read a spoiler....<br />I was probably MOST disappointed in cutting out the history of James, Sirius, Peter and Lupine...How Sirius and lupine were Jame's Hermione and Ron...  They left out the whole history of how they created the Marauders map. THey NEVER told Harry, that I can right now recall, that Harry's Patronus was the same as his fathers animagnus. (sorry If i butcher spellings). so much intamate history just left out :(.<br />I also didnt like how they left out the whole secret \\"knot\\" of the womping willow and crrokshanks helping Sirius.<br />When looking at the DVD extras I ran across deleted scenes that I think SHOULD have been in the movie... Sir Cadogan has some pretty funny parts!<br />WELL enough of my little whine, It is a great movie, even though it feels like it is missing some important parts.<br />The creation of Buckbeak was absolutley amazing!!<br />The DVD games? get 1 star... they were lame.<br />I did enjoy all the other extras though.The creation of Buckbeak was absolutley amazing!!

B000B2YQX4|4.0|A lot of things died after their height in the 80s:  cassette tapes, leg warmers, and The Cosby Show. Thanks to largely in part to Depeche Mode, dark synthpop wasn't one of them. It's often tricky for musicians to enter a third decade of greatness; they start to lose a certain element of passion that makes for energetic yet broody music. Depeche Mode hasn't, and Playing the Angel proves it.<br /><br />In past, Depeche Mode have made a habit of having two or three outstanding tracks per album, with the rest standing mediocre (not bad enough to be considered \\"fillers,\\" but you know what I mean). Although Playing the Angel doesn't provide me any new absolute favorite Depeche Mode songs (as in top 3 type favorite) all the tracks stand above mediocre.<br /><br />Some fans prefer an ultra-upbeat Depeche Mode, while others cling to the group's more ballad-like favorites. Playing the Angel returns to both forms. It begins with traditional synthpop feel and then downs the tempo to a more relaxed vibe. In other words, at first you have the dance club, then you transform into what happens after the club--a stalking under the moonlight, being thrown back into reality and not catching a consistent rhythm to it.<br /><br />Highlights are the first single \\"Precious,\\" the overcast \\"Damaged People,\\" the catchy \\"Lillian,\\" and the last and quietest track, \\"The Darkest Star.\\"<br /><br />The production isn't perfect--at times I'm not sure where to turn the volume, and I'm wondering whether or not this is intentional. In comparison to their post-80's work, Playing the Angel is a step above Exiter and on par with Violator, Songs of Faith and Devotion, and Ultra.
B00005JO9J|5.0|The first season is nine episodes. Thats why the price is so low. This set is the entire first season.
B000021YQV|5.0|\\"Toxicity\\", System of a Down's sophmore album is undoubtably one of the greatest Rock albums. The timing of this album really set a tone for rock music. Debuting at #1 the day after 9/11 and having their hit song \\"Chop Suey!\\" banned from the airwaves. Sine then SOAD has becoming one of the biggest bands in rock music today. But lets get back on the subject; There are many words I could use to describe this album but one particularly comes to mind...Crazy. From thrashing tracks like \\"Needles\\" and \\"Psycho\\" to more melodic tracks like \\"Chop Suey!\\" and \\"Arieals\\". Every SOAD fan needs to have this album. Nevermind my babble, here is the individual rating on each awesome track: <br /> <br />1. Prison Song-(10/10)- One of the best opener songs I've heard in a while. Hard hitting lyrics with thrashing guitars licks.  <br />This song obviously contains material of prison and statistics too. Not only is it kick *ss, but educational too... <br /> <br />2. Needles(10/10)- The very first time I heard this I didnt think much of it. Then as I listened more to lyrics and understood it I got the picture. Remember, you have to have an open mind when listening to SOAD. <br /> <br />3. Deer Dance-(10/10)- One of my favorite SOAD tracks of all time. The verses of this song are breath taking. Darons work is awesome as usual. Bravo. <br /> <br />4. Jet Pilot-(9/10)- A pretty typical SOAD song. Very heavy and Serj lets out on some fast paced singing.  <br /> <br />5. X-(10/10)- I enjoy this one alot more then Jet Pilot. The layout of the song is pretty much the same as JP. <br /> <br />6. Chop Suey!-(13/10)- The stand out song on this album and of its time of release. In the summer of 01' the rock charts were ruled by bands like Sum 41 and Blink 182 but SOAD stood out like a light in a dark room and pumped up toxicitys hype. <br /> <br />7. Bounce-(10/10)-This song knocks you back into toxicitys normal flow. It has a cute little story in this track.  <br /> <br />8.Forest-(10/10)- Anotherone of my favorite songs. All the chemicals came together for this one with astonishing lyrics. <br /> <br />9. ATWA-(10/10)- A slow, but heavy song. Alot of people consider this the best song but I dont wanna get over my head here. <br /> <br />10.Science-(10/10)- In the middle of this song all of these weird noises come in and take you completely out of the album. Tribal noises, some kind of horn, It'll have you scratching your head. <br /> <br />11.Shimmy(10/10)- The most fun song of the alubm. \\"Im gonna shimmy shimmy shimmy till the break of dawn, yeah!\\" One of the best SOAD lyrics.  <br /> <br />12. Toxicity-(10/10)- The 2nd single. Serj rules all with his simplicit yet soulful singing and weird outburt in the end of this song. The video for this was also amazing.  <br /> <br />13. Psycho-(10/10)- Another SOAD song about cocaine. Throw in a little Sex material and crazyniess and you have the perfect Las vegas anthem here. <br /> <br />14. Aerials(10/10)- The most over played SOAD song since before BYOB. But it honestly deserved it. A truly epic song If I may say. Everything flows perfectly and earns the title of the most succesful song on this album. <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, it is a classic album. It is compared to Nevermind, Pretty hate machine, and other Rock classis LP's. Also pick up Mezmerize/ Hypnotize and all the other SOAD albums. They are all worth the price of a couple bucks. <br />
B00003XAVA|5.0|I rarely give five stars on any of my reviews.  Actually, most people who read them may not find then favorable.  I am not looking to be the most popular reviewer on Amazon, but perhaps one of the most realistic.  I bought this on vinyl when it first came out and was delighted to buy it on CD about a year ago.  It makes me wonder how I did without it so long....  Their isn't a bad song on this CD...Hence, the five stars!!!!  This is a well-produced CD.  My favorite selections are Carry Me, Take The Money And Run, Homeward Through The Haze, and the title track.  Take your money and run to buy this one if you are a fan of CSN&Y.  You will probably find this is even better than a lot of what they all did together.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I loved John Mayer's music prior to this Cd, but I love it even more now. As a writer and an artist myself, I appreciate that Mayer can write, sing, and play his own music. Try! just goes to show how much Mayer and his sound have grown up- he's shedding his popstar image to remain true to the reason he first pursued music- blues. A neighbor once gave a young John Mayer a copy of a SRV tape and got him hooked on blues. On this CD, you can definitely see him putting his influences to good use. I especially loved \\"Who Did You Think I Was\\", \\"Another Kind of Green\\", \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\", and \\"Out of My Mind\\". Am also looking forward to the release of his new album in spring of 2006.
B000006YGY|5.0|Eloy (name taken from H G Well`s Time Machine) is a German Atmospheric, Progressive Art Rock band that was formed back in 1969. Through the years, personal wise, the band has totally turned over, in some positions, several times. Their originator Frank Bornemann (guitars/vocals) has persevered, presiding over a three decade band, that has turned out some of the best progressive rock music, I've had the fortune to hear.<br /><br />OCEAN<br /><br />Ocean, their sixth album, released in 1977, is a concept album, depicting the rise and fall of Atlantis. Though there are only four tracks, they average almost eleven minutes each. Many Eloy aficionados point to this album as their `tour de force'. It is excellent, but as far as I'm concerned , based on what I've heard so far, there is no album that stands heads above the others.<br /><br />Overall, Ocean has an atmospheric ambience reminiscent of Hawkwind or a more unknown band that I once reviewed named Ship of Fools. It also reminds me Jeff Wayne's, War of the Worlds.<br /><br />Track listing<br /><br />1. Poseidon's Creation (11:38) **** Has a long droning medium pace and a whinny guitar intro. At the 4:40 mark, Bornemann finally begins the vocal. There is quite a lot of guitar playing on this song, augmented occasionally by the synth.<br /><br />2. Incarnation Of The Logos (8:25) **** Has an atmospheric vocal beginning. The song doesn't seem to have much of a melody until the 3:40 mark when the synth/organ takes over with a pleasant one, assisted by some percussion and a bell now and then.<br /><br />3. Decay Of The Logos (8:15) ***½ The shortest song at eight minutes seems a little jerky at first with more monologue than music. When it does get going after about three minutes it's still jerky in a medium paced beat. Strong synth playing through the middle.<br /><br />4. Atlantis' Agony At June 5th - 8498, 13 p.m. Gregorian Earthtime (15:35) *****<br /><br />This is a monster song. It is like nothing I've ever heard. Except for a fifty some second monologue at the beginning, \\"Atlantis...\\" starts with a truly intriguing eight minute plus instrumental intro. Not just any intro, like you're used to, with a full orchestra and violins. No this is an spacey atmospheric intro that would make the great Pink Floyd, envious, with the propitious use of ghostly sounds and special effects segueing into an amazing five minute organ bridge, with no beat just the Hammond a few side effects and you. No it doesn't get boring. Instead it sets you up for the vocals, which issue forth at about the eight minute mark. Slowly the rhythm section establishes a slow beat, while the singer does a great imitation of Bob Dylan, with a remarkable spacey synth breaking in between the vocal. But we're not done. With about two minutes left, the band picks up the tempo to a medium fast tempo (the first time I`ve heard them play at this speed). Now the violins join in with the guitar and synth for the finale of this great finale.<br /><br />Total Time: 43:53<br /><br />Line-up<br /><br />- Frank Bornemann / guitars, vocals<br /><br />- Klaus-Peter Matziol / basses, vocals<br /><br />- J&uuml;rgen Rosenthal / drums, percussion, flute<br /><br />- Detlev Schmidtchen / keyboards, mellotron, xylophone, voice<br /><br />- The Boys Of Santiago / chorus (1)<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />One of the factors, I find appealing about this band, is that in the span of three decades, they managed to present a style of music which was compatible with each era, so listening to their albums from different periods gives us a window into the progressive music of various time periods. Eloy's musical tempo almost never exceeds medium and on Ocean tends to be more in the medium slow range.<br /><br />Listening to this and other Eloy albums I hear influences from numerous other bands. Like many prog bands I hear Pink Floyd but I also hear Uriah Heep, Moody Blues and Bob Dylan (really, on track four!).er heard.

B00005JNX0|5.0|I had no plans to see this movie and avoided it in the theater.  However, when my kid got the DVD for a gift; I gave it a watch.<br /><br />Suprisingly I liked it.  Normally I am not a Ben  Stiller fan but he did a good job as Alex the lion.  Chris Rock did well as Marty and David Sshwimer was good a Melman.  Jada Pinket was ok but her character only did so much.<br /><br />Overall the best characters were the penguins and the Lemur King; especially when he sang the \\"move it move it\\" song.<br /><br />It's a silly film and you might have to explain some things to your children especially if they are young.  My 4 year old thought there were lions, giraffes, zebras and hippos on Madagasgar(she wanted to go there to see them :) ).<br /><br />Overall the humor is well done and there are references to other films throughout the movie.  For example the Twilight zone episode \\"How to serve man.\\"<br /><br />I will again mention the Penguins as probably the best part of the film.  They alone are worth the price of the DVD.<br /><br />The addons are ok.  Some you will either play or look at once.<br /><br />They added the Penguin Christmas short to the DVD.  Really funny as my father-in-law doesn't really care for todays cartoons but he did laugh for it.<br /><br />Overall a worthwhile addition to a collection.
B00008ADPF|1.0|This is pointless generic radio rock. If you like Chemical Romance, Simple Plan, Fallout Boy and other MTV crapola, then you'll probably enjoy playing air guitar along to this.  <br />Pick up some good stuff like... <br />Korn(old stuff), Breaking Benjamin, Green Day(Warning and before), Smile Empty Soul, Lostprophets, Aerosmith, Exies, Papa Roach, Disturbed, Blindside... need i go on?
B0009W5JS2|4.0|Now, first off, I realized that not alot of people liked this movie. And many will probably disagree my view review of this movie. But I thought XXX: State of the Union lived up to pretty much all of the anticipation that I was expecting. And to let you all this, I'm 20 years old ( so I'm a kid), but I definitely was a kid at heart and mind when I was watching this movie. The only real dissappointment of this movie is the fact that Vin Disel wasn't in it, he was the heart of this franchise. But I thought Ice Cube handled himself pretty well in this movie. But Disel is the reason this one didn't do so well, this was his franchise, and he threw it away to do \\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\"  and \\"The Pacifier\\". Big mistake!!!  But still I did very much enjoyed this movie, and I've been hearing that even thought this one didn't do that well. Rob Cohen is still possibly considering a XXX3. But the XXX for the next movie might be a woman. If this does happen, and Rob Cohen might be reading this review may I make a suggestion for the female XXX. Kristana Loken.  Just think about it. The \\"T-X\\" as XXX. One more time XXX: State of the Union was a good action movie, and the biggest gulity pleasure film of 2005
B000BKVQTS|1.0|Some other reviewers have called this the worst movie ever! I agree to some extent. There are worse movies I am sure, but as far as big budget items it is right up there along with Van Helsing.You would think a director could step back and take a long impartial look at what he is foisting on the viewing public, but alas that does not seem to be the case, I know Van Helsing had hopes of being a franchise (cold day in Hell)but this Grim (one M ) piece of detritus has nothing to say and nowhere to go despite its obvious cost and length. I did not see it in theatres as it got very bad reviews. I read somewhere that T Gilliam bemoaned the fact of having to cut the most expensive scene (Monster tree)due to length and this influenced my purchase of DVD,,Ha! My error, the walloping willow in Harry Potter was similarly done and considerably better,,,it was wise to cut this scene,,so much snaky tree root activity remains in the picture,by and large the immortal bard's words sum up this entire project \\"full of Sound and fury yet signifying nothing\\" <br />Pass on this one or rent if you must!
B00000I8UE|5.0|It is a particularly difficult thing to do, recreating the spirit of a musician with such a enormous persolity as Miles through a tribute album, without falling in mannerism or without simply copying the original. Cassandra didin't go wrong here, proving to be a true artist (like John McLaughlin in his tribute to Bill Evans). She tributed Miles here recreating his blackness, his sophisticated use of space and his sense of harmony but without coping him. The music here is both Davis and Wilson. It's not  atribute in a sense, it is Miss Wilson who meets Miles Davis. I really feel Miles's spirit in these voodo, black arrangements when you have slide or acoustic guitars and percussions for example, and I feel his presence too in the way Cassandra use wide spaces in tunes such as Tutu or Blue in green. The totally absence of virtuosisms, the will to tell a story and to give each note weight .. this is truly what Miles was about essentially and you can find him here in these tunes. The ones I love the most are the opener, Someday my prince will come, Tutu and Blue in green. They are original versions of these songs, absolutly not common or already heard versions. I think that you have to be really courageous to realize an album such as this one, tributing Miles but injecting in this music your own vision. You have to be a true artist, such as Cassandra. My plause! Morevoer I think this album could be enjoyed by the jazz novices too because it is not a difficult album, it maintains a sense of natural easyness.. and it has a very contemporary, interesting atmosphere with nice sounds. Very good. I'd give four stars and a half it it was an option. I choose five against four because it's very rare to find an artist with enough personality to do things like this.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Serenity is the sci fi epic based on the show Firefly, a show which (in the words of its director) was \\"immediately hailed as one of the most cancelled shows of the year.\\" But in its short run, it gained an incredibly strong cult following, and pressure from the show's fans and creators led to the creation of the film. In Joss Wheton's introduction to the film, he gives the fans equal credit with the film's creation, \\"so if it sucks, it's your fault.\\" It didn't.    Serenity is every sci fi fan's dream. Its special effects aren't really that special, but they're handled well enough that we believe them. Moreover, they're shown with style. Our first look at the ship Serenity isn't accompanied by a great ochestral score or the whir of a theremin, but by a banjo/violin duet which sings gently as the camera whooshes around the hull. Once inside, the captain calmly announces that the ship \\"may experience some slight turbulence, then explode.\\" Earlier this year I praised Revenge of the Sith for its opening shot being a single long take, but Serenity does it one better with its Russian-Ark-esque steadicam shot of the crew planning a robbery after crash-landing.    This all happens shortly after one of the most brilliant opening sequences I've ever seen. We're given a little background on how Earth colonized another solar system. As it turns out, it's a woman teaching a history class. As that turns out, the history class is the dream of a brainwash victim before her daring escape. As it turns out, the footage her daring escape was from a security feed being reviewed by the guy sent to catch her. It has more or less the same effect of someone dreaming about someone dreaming about someone dreaming and so on. I wondered if the whole film would continue in that sense. It didn't but I'm not complaining.    Serenity might be a sci fi film, but it felt to me more like a western. That's not anything particularly original (Cowboy Bebop and Star Wars are notorious for drawing influence from western style), but Serenity almost seems doesn't know it's referencing the style. It never exploits it more than necessary. Come to think of it, there are also some samurai references, but likewise, the film only employs that style to drive its already intriguing story.    I'm not sure it will work for everyone, but if you've ever watched a film on the Sci Fi Channel at one in the morning, or if you've ever attended Chillercon or similar conventions, or if you just like sci fi in general, Serenity is an experience that you will likely enjoy.
0345440900|5.0|Bless Tracy Hogg!  This book reads up-beat and matter-of-fact.  It's wonderfully helpful, especially if you read it before your first baby is born.  Don't over-analyze it, don't freak-out.  Just use this book to give your new family a guideline of what to expect, a flexible plan of action, and then adjust it as you go.  Babies evolve rapidly in the first couple years of their lives.  It's reasonable to expect that their routine will too.   <br /> <br />Both of my children were breastfed AND bottle-fed.  My first-born was a super-easy baby, and my second-born was colicky and MUCH more demanding of every fiber of my being... and this book helped me with BOTH of them, equally.   <br /> <br />I attribute the healthy, well-rounded food preferences of, not only my two children, but also fourteen other toddlers & children I know, to her approach to introducing solid foods (pages 130 & 131). <br /> <br />I recommend all expecting moms AND dads read this book, take some of it to heart, keep some of it on your mind, AND RELAX AND DON'T OVER-ANALYZE. <br />
B000AMJDHY|4.0|This is a pretty good album.  I wouldn't say it's great, but good.  There are a few good songs that I enjoyed listening to, but they got old fast.  The only thing I didnt like is the dance part.  I mean it was fit in good in \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom...\\", but not very good in the others.  Theres also a wide assortment of instruments that arent really supposed to be in rock songs. <br /> <br />The best songs are: <br />\\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom...\\" <br />\\"Lying Is The Most Fun...\\" <br />\\"But It's Better If You Do\\" <br />\\"I Write Sins, Not Tragedies\\" <br />This is my opinion.  And yes, they are closely related to Fall Out Boy.  Here's why:  <br />1.Are signed to Pete Wentz's record label.  (Bassist in FOB for people who didnt know) <br />2.Brandon and Patrick's voices sound similar. <br />3.Both of their albums contain extremely long titles that are annoying to fit on your iPod.  (Sorry I had to include the iPod part) <br />Not that they're bad or anything, but both bands are alike in some ways, but Panic! At The Disco would sound almost the same as FOB without the dance parts of the songs.  But overall, this album is good.  <br /> <br />If you're a FOB fan, you will definetly enjoy this album.
B000002I55|5.0|This music is goes in so many directions at once that it can be hard to get a grip on it at first...then you realise I don't need to get a grip on it - it is simply there - and beautiful. Jazz is one of the few art forms to really emphasise the transience of life...and this is what jazz can be..call it noise or a masterpiece - that is all perception. Your personal taste may not be able to digest it..but give it a try anyway. Ornette Coleman is one of the most distinctive sounding musicians of the 60's and he has a very tight ensemble here.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|My friend told me about this band one day, so i downlaoded some of their songs and i was AMAZED. I soon got the album and its ALWAYS playiong in my stereo, my stereo can hold 5 cds and it does, but i usually only keep it on a fever you can't sweat out <br />every song is outstanding, P!ATD and FOB are both my fav bands. i heard FOB first and thoguht they were great, but Panic! is even BETTER. So if you like Fall Out Boy definitly get this album
B000001FYL|5.0|I'm described by my friends as someone who is not much into music, which is probably true. But, I listen to Bon Jovi because I feel that he sings about a topic because he feels it. <br /> <br />He tackles various issues with his songs and I can relate to the way he expresses his feelings. I've listened to most of his albums (except the last one or two). They are all good. <br /> <br />However, there is something about this album and \\"These Days\\". I cannot remember the number of times that I've listened to this song when I'm down. If I were a song writer, I would have expressed my feelings with these songs and I probably would have sung with the emotion that Bon Jovi has delivered them. The songs in this album touch me. They make me cry because I feel touched and then give me hope.  <br /> <br />In my humble opinion, there is no better album out there by any other artist. If you are struggling in some aspect of life, listen tto this album. If you are heart-broken, listen to \\"These Days\\". <br /> <br />How can one not get inspired by these lyrics below. It makes me wanna get up and fight when life knocks me down.  <br />------------------ <br />Never say die, never say no,  <br />You got to look them in the eye and don't let go.  <br />When it's your own blood you'll bleed,  <br />And your own tears you'll cry.  <br />When you're brought up to believe,  <br />That it's the strong who survive......  <br />Never say die. <br /> <br />Yeah, we could run like lightening, through the pouring rain,  <br />And we'll be standing like a solider, who comes marching home again. <br /> <br />They ask what it is that I want written on the gravestone where I'll lie,  <br />Tell them it's just my bones that died there, so save the tears they'll cry.  <br />My spirit is still riding somewhere in this night,  <br />When it's these three words that come to me, as I kiss this world goodbye. <br />
B00005U1YO|4.0|I just can't understand why you would mix the tracks on your album. I admit it sounds fluid when listening to the album sequentially, but if you want to take any of the tracks out of order? Put them on your mp3 player perhaps? Well you can buy the cd-singles, but what about the tracks that aren't released as singles? It's just so homo to mix your album. Other than that I was pretty impressed having never heard anything from The Chemical Brothers before. My favorites are 'Star Guitar', 'Come with Us', 'My Elastic Eye', and 'The State We're In'. 'Come with Us' has to be the most high energy track on the album with it's electro sounds reminiscent of an arcade pinball machine or something. Love it.
B000002J27|5.0|It was 1976 and Peter Gabriel had not been a part of the band for about a year or so.  Gone were the days of Peter Gabriel singing while dressed in a red dress and wearing a fox head.  So too were the days of Genesis playing epic pieces that wove tales of good and evil, split personalities, aliens, and wetland plants seeking revenge.  In the stead of this cosmic philosophizing came populist leanings - Genesis had finally descended from the clouds and landed firmly with both feet on earth.  This great 1976 release marks the first with Phil Collins expanding his duties from drumming/backup vocals to include the lead vocalist role.  His voice was not as idiosyncratic as Peters and most likely contributed a great deal to Genesis losing their cult band status and gaining a wider audience.  Although Phil acting as the lead vocalist played a significant part in this shift, the marked change in the compositional approach was infinitely more significant.  Specifically, the pieces were shorter on average, yet still exhibited the excellent ensemble work that characterized their earlier pieces, albeit in a somewhat reduced and simplified form - for example, there were no more 23-minute long epics, and Tony Banks had abandoned the use of lengthy piano overtures with shifting meters as on the intro to Firth of Fifth.  In the words of Tony Banks, Genesis had finally become a \\"band\\".  The eight pieces on the album range from the delicate Steve Hackett/Tony Banks piece Entangled and Tony Banks acoustic piano-driven Mad Man Moon to the thunderous, proggy jazz-rock of Los Endos - Phil Collins was in the English jazz-rock band Brand X at this point and was bringing that influence into Genesis, much to the chagrin of Steve Hackett.  My personal favorite on the album is Robbery, Assault, and Battery, which features a technically intricate solo played by Tony on the ARP Pro soloist and some glorious mellotron pads.  Other aspects of the music that I appreciate include the acoustic piano work of Tony Banks - he really is an excellent player!  Overall, this is a great album that has a warmer, less dark feel to it than earlier works such as Nursery Cryme (1971) or Foxtrot (1972) and is highly recommended along with the excellent Wind and Wuthering (1976).ork of Tony Banks - he really is an excellent player!

0465043550|4.0|A few months ago, I found almost casually an editorial by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, introducing this essay by Benoit Mandelbrot (you can find it on Wilmot Magazine,2005 pag.50-59 -  downloadable from his webpage)<br />As most readers, I vaguely knew about Mandelbrot and his studies on fractal geometry - but simply it was not my peculiar field of interest, so when I saw the ad of his new book, it went ignored.<br />*<br />Taleb's editorial aroused my curiosity.<br />He was stressing the significance of this essay in challenging the current orthodoxies on finance and in recommending new tools for risk management.<br />*<br />In a sense Taleb's recommendation represents a guarantee.<br />He is a famous edge fund manager and the author of \\"Fooled by Randomness - The hidden role of chance in the Markets and in life\\", a book that impressed me with the wide culture, multi-disciplinary approach and the sheer acumen.<br />*<br />\\"The (mis)Behavior of the Market\\" was up to my expectations.<br />The book is interesting, and not just for the economic views it advances. Mandelbrot is extremely learned - not just in his field of expertise - and his approach is challenging while retaining great plainness of exposition.<br />*<br />The book is organized in three parts.<br />The first part deals with the old theories of finance and with the state of the art, to show how all of the old tools are mostly inadequate to control investment risk and how they  leave investors with a false sense of safety.<br />In the second part - the most specific and technical - Mandelbrot proposes his view of how the markets behave, suggesting a multi-fractal approach as a substitute for the random walk/efficient market theory.<br />The third part proposes some conclusion based both on Mandelbrot's views and common sense.<br />*<br />The first part is probably the most interesting and also  the most cogent.<br />Modern orthodoxy of finance (Capital Asset Pricing Model or CAPM) is based on the  shaky assumption that financial phenomena can be described according to a Gaussian normal distribution, that is they claim to be able to eliminate the possibility of extreme un-forecasted events with a 99 percent probability and to indicate for each level of risk an efficient portfolio maximizing return.<br />Mandelbrot demonstrates rather conclusively that Gaussian normal distribution of financial prices has been subject to oversimplification to make the data fit in the model, because of \\"fat tails\\", concentration and extreme events.<br />This means that CAPM is useful only when there is less need of it - that is when markets are calm, while is of no utility with extreme events.<br />Exposing weaknesses in the orthodoxy is not an intellectual pastime, since everyone can still remember the crash of 1987, the many financial crises from 1992 (the disruption of the European exchange rate mechanism, the crises of Mexico, South East Asia, Russia, Argentina,...), the disaster of LTCM in 1998 (it employed 25 PhD and 2 Nobel medalist in economics for their works in finance) and lastly the financial crises after the buoyant markets and high tech bubbles of 2000.<br />*<br />By mismanagement and ignorance great fortunes are created but many more are wasted, so the need of a new more efficient tools is imperative.<br />*<br />The second part is much more specific and technical.<br />It explains Mandelbrot's multi-fractal approach, but is still a series of proposals for further inquiries, more than a comprehensive theory of market behavior.<br />*<br />In this second part, I sensed some minor inconsistencies, but since I'm not a mathematician and even less a scientist, I can be - and probably am - mistaken.<br />*<br />Mandelbrot seems to overlook that finance, unlike natural phenomena, is subject to a very specific epistemological problem. A theory of market behavior - if widely used - can cause alteration in that same behavior previously described and now forecasted (it happened - for example - in 1987 with portfolio insurance strategies and again with the January effect, that disappeared once it was discovered).<br />*<br />A relevant problem is also the interpretation of the financial data. His analysis of the prices of cotton over more than a hundred years is using raw data, apparently without taking any consideration for the underlying changes in production, distribution, commerce and use of financial instruments (options and futures). This is even more complex for stocks, since we have different markets, different regulation and different economic situations.<br />*<br />While in the first part Mandelbrot cites studies indicating that shares with low p/e and low p/b have shown higher returns over long time-spans, in the second part he declares that returns appear to be independent from time spans. Now this is a classic case of either .. or...<br />*<br />Also rejection of the concept of value (\\"In financial markets, the idea of \\"value\\" has limited value\\") in part three can be misleading.<br />True, volatility may be high and prices may be swinging wildly, but none the less a theory refusing to guess a fair value based on conservative estimates, can be extremely dangerous.<br />*<br />Previous remarks converge on the main weakness of the essay: pretension to describe financial phenomena ex post, that is to find an elegant mathematical model that easily explains the \\"(mis)behavior\\", with scarce attention to the underlying causes.<br />But if underlying causal events should be working no more, we can theoretically believe also effects will be different and we will be left with a new obsolete theory of market efficiency.<br />*<br />The third part is rather average.<br />There are chapters with sensible advice (\\"markets are turbulent\\", \\"more risky than the standard theories imagine \\", \\"market timing matters greatly\\" ... and so on)<br />Chapter XIII is a rather gratuitous ad to financial wizards who are said to be using multi-fractal models. No proof is given of this instance - since most of these models are reputedly secret - and sincerely I cannot understand the relevance to mention them in the essay.<br />*<br />Because of my work and personal curiosity, I'm fascinated by financial risk and risk management.<br />If you happen to be fond of these themes, you may be interested in other works I chanced to read about the same topic:<br />\\"Against the Gods\\" by Peter Bernstein - very entertaining history of the human struggle in confronting chaos and randomness.

B0009F9O6M|5.0|I went out and bought all of the EMI remastered albums and they are simply superb.  The sound quality of H to He Who am the Only One has been vastly improved upon and the liner notes are wonderfully detailed and include various photos of the band scattered throughout.  In addition to the original tracks, the electrifying and thunderous 15'24\\" Squid1/Squid 2/Octopus was added on along with the first version of The Emperor in his War Room. I should note that EMI did not use copy-control technology on the remastered albums so playback problems should not plague listeners.<br /><br />This is the bleakest, most gothic prog rock I have ever heard.  Instrumentation is sparse, with great drumming from Guy Evans (I can really hear the subtleties of his playing on the cleaned up recording), solid bass playing from Nic Potter, twisted Hammond organ work from keyboardist Hugh Banton, angular and aggressive sax playing from David Jackson (he would play two saxes at the same time - in fact Jackson, not to mention Colosseum sax player Dick Heckstall-Smith borrowed this technique from jazzer Rahsaan Roland Kirk) and a tiny bit of aggressive guitar work from guest Robert Fripp on \\"The Emperor in his War Room\\".  Although synthesizers are largely absent, Hugh Banton is in fact credited with using an oscillator - which is a crude synthesizer (wave form generator actually).  The most distinctive aspects of the music are Peter Hammill's anguished lyrics and his vocal delivery, which ranges from a tortured, heavy metal rasp to a smooth, high-pitched falsetto.  While some folks find his vocals overwrought and excessively dramatic (this reaches a peak on \\"Lost\\"), it really makes this music work.  Pieces are in the 6'00-12'25 range, with the heaviest track being the introductory \\"Killer\\".  Although describing the music in terms of tortured, harsh, and anguished must conjure up sounds of a bandsaw ripping through galvanized steel, the music is not entirely abrasive.  \\"House with No Door\\" is a very quiet and sad piece, and \\"The Emperor in his War Room\\", \\"Lost\\", and \\"Pioneers over c\\" all feature haunting and reflective sections in amongst the chaos.  Though \\"H to He: Who am the Only One\\" is a good starting point, other excellent recordings by Van der Graaf Generator include \\"The Least we can do is Wave to Each Other (1970); Pawn Hearts (1971); Godbluff (1975) and Still Life (1976).  Of these recordings, Pawn Hearts is their acclaimed best yet makes for extremely difficult listening.a very quiet and sad piece, and \\"The Emperor in his War Room\\", \\"Lost\\", and \\"Pioneers over c\\" all feature haunting and reflective sections in amongst the chaos.

B00005JO1Y|5.0|If there's any further proof necessary that the best filmmakers are those who passionately love their material, it's Peter Jackson.  It's hard to believe that Jackson could top his painstaking adherence to details he exhibited in Lord of the Rings, but he does just that in with King Kong, a subject with considerably less material to round it out.  After all, this is just a story about a big monkey, right? Jackson disagrees.<br /><br />Kong's story is now a part of American culture: a giant gorilla (Kong, a digital puppet controlled by Andy Serkis of Gollum fame) lurks somewhere on a mysterious island, a world populated by fantastic dinosaurs and creepy crawlies of all types.  Accustomed to battling predators for his food, we discover that Kong is the last of his kind.  It is here that Carl Denham (Jack Black) will film his new movie.  To that end, he ropes in Ann Darrow (the lovely Naomi Watts) and Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler) as his leads along with scriptwriter Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody). Even the crew has been hoodwinked into going. There's no one that Carl won't lie to, including the financiers of his film.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the crew, they actually manage to discover Skull Island.  After an attack by the natives, Anne is kidnapped and sacrificed to Kong.  Kong decides there's something different about her (the implication is that it's her blonde hair).  Anne relies on all of her thespian powers to keep the big gorilla from smashing her head in.  Which is a good thing, because she always wanted to be a comedienne but could never find an audience.  With Kong, she gets the chance to do physical comedy.  Kong finds it hysterical, proving that tripping and falling on your face is a universally funny joke.<br /><br />But their idyllic relationship, with Kong as protector, is not to last.  Eventually, Anne is rescued and Kong is captured, brought back to New York to serve as a Broadway act. As terrifying and frightening as he seems, Kong is no match for the urban jungle.  There's nothing Carl won't exploit, including the very wonder of discovery.  He stages a vulgar show that trusses the giant gorilla up in chains.  A winsome sacrifice is presented, just like on Skull Island...only it's not Anne.  Things do downhill (or, if you prefer, drop from a considerable height) from there.  You know the rest.<br /><br />This version of King Kong is a masterful, outsized version of the 1930s original.  By staying true to the characters, the movie ends up being more of a silent screen piece, filled with affectionate gazes between Kong and Anne.  Communication is limited between the two characters, but it's a testament to Jackson's directing that we can see the connection.  Kong's eyes are amazingly expressive, more so than his human counterparts. This is a welcome departure from the 1970s version, where Jessica Lange constantly began every sentence with, \\"Kong...\\" so the audience was reminded she was talking to the gorilla.  We got it, thanks.<br /><br />Amazingly, Black manages to keep his manic energy tightly focused.  The character of Carl is believable through both Black's action as well as his pop-eyed sneers.  Although he feigns courage, sorrow, and affection, Carl is the real monster in this movie and it's to Black's credit that he's a believable character rather than a one-note cipher.<br /><br />Everyone else is essentially sidelined by the special effects, which are off-the-wall insane.  Kong himself is fantastically rendered, but that's expected.  What is surprising are the fauna of Skull Island.  Giant flying bats, carnivorous muck worms, killer centipedes, rampaging velociraptors, tyrannosaurus rexes (sorry, V-rexes), brontosauruses, and a bunch of other outsized monsters stomp, screech, and ultimately die at Kong's giant hands.  Forget Jurassic Park, Kong combines a brontosaurus stampede with velociraptor chase that ends with an awful creepy-crawly fest that will make you want to take a shower afterwards. And thenthere's the three-way battle between T-rexes and Kong that has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />If there's a flaw, it's the set up and arrival of the natives.  Alternately meant to be spooky and pathetic, Jackson resorts to a lot of blurry shots.  I hate blurry shots.  I hate them with a passion.  The only time I've ever felt that a blurry camera shot is necessary was in Gladiator, where it was a welcome reprieve from gut-wrench combat...in essence, the audience needed a breather.  In the 70s and 80s, the blur technique was used to cover up low-budget effects in horror movies (see The Watcher for a more modern egregious example).  It slows the film down, is particularly jarring in tone, and ultimately does the sequence a disservice.  The natives are scary all on their own without blurry camera angles.  It's the only time in the whole film that you actually feel the three hours.<br /><br />But that's a minor quibble. Jackson's body of work is evidence that one day, fanboys will rule the world. Here's hoping we'll have more directors like him who revere their material as deeply.rds.

B000063Y8F|5.0|I have had many garlic presses but never really liked one till now.  One year of use (and many trips through the dishwasher) and this still looks brand new, works beautifully, and is a joy to own.  I even took it with me on a camping trip because I just can't go back to the way I used to add garlic (either mincing with a knife or using powder) or use an inferior press. <br /> <br />This is the kind of high quality kitchen tool you'll use for a lifetime, well worth the price.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|Kar Wai Wong is more than a film director (though he is one of the finest directors working today!): he is a visual, poetic, creative and daring artist capable of more cinematic miracles in one isolated film than most directors achieve in a lifetime.  '2046' is a visually stunning, intellectually challenging, emotionally charged view of love and lust in today's kinetically dysfunctional society.<br /><br />There is no one way to interpret this non-linear film and therein lies much of its rewards.  The main character Chow (Tony Leung) is a writer and a libertine who has pushed his vacuous life around with his hormones and though he has had many affairs he has failed to find the illusory 'love'.  He has lived in Singapore and Hong Kong, makes his living writing columns of newspapers while his novels formulate in his mind.  One of his novels is called '2046', the title based on the room number in a hotel where he witnessed a bizarre incident involving a gorgeous woman, and resulted in his moving into the adjoining room 2047 where is meets the hotel manager's daughter in love with a Filipino Japanese man her father loathes.  He desires this unattainable woman and fuses her with a fictional 'android' in his novel which now uses '2046' as a year or time or place where people go to find memories.  He continues to encounter women for whom he desires more than surface relationships (there is a stunning lady gambler cameo who represents everything he lusts and longs for, etc) but he is never able to find his tenuous ideal: his memory is his only source of consolation.<br /><br />The actors in every role include many of the finest actors available: Li Gong, Ziyi Zhang, Carina Lau, Maggie Cheung, Takuya Kimura, Chen Chang, and of course Tony Leung.  But it is Kar Wai Wong, the writer, director, choreographer, colorist, visionary that makes this excursion into the interstices of the mind/imagination so overwhelmingly satisfying.  Whether the viewer elects to view the story as a continyation of the director's previous films, or as reality vs memory, fiction vs imagination, sci-fi excursion, or simply a plethora of vignettes about the challenges of finding love in a world geared toward instant gratification, this is a magnificent achievement.  In many ways the sound track could be turned off (though the beautiful musical score by  Peer Raben and Shigeru Umebayashi with a lot of help from Maria Callas! would be missed), and the inventive cinematography and visual image manipulations by Christopher Doyle, Pung-Leung Kwan and Yiu-Fai Lai such as the constant dividing of the screen into triptychs and diptychs would remain some of the most beautiful photographic images on film.<br /><br />This is not an easy film to follow and it is most assuredly one that will grow in importance with repeated viewings. The comparison with Alain Resnais' 'Last Year at Marienbad' suggests its potency. But free the mind and enter into the world of '2046' for one of the most satisfying cinematic achievements of the recent past.  Very highly recommended.

1416905014|5.0|I have been fascinated by the Cinderella story since I was a small child attending the opening of the Disney movie at Radio City Music Hall.  I have many books representing many cultures telling this precious tale.  This, by far, is the most exquisite! <br />
0156907399|5.0|I really enjoyed this one. Read the dinner table scene and you'll see why Woolf was admired for her fluid, realistic and breath-taking style. She makes everyone in the cast have internal dialogues while they're also talking out loud. Purely brilliant stuff. A great read, the language will jump into you and won't let go. It's like a poem within a poem within a poem...
0307276902|4.0|This book is very interesting, and very depressing.  James Frey went through some horrific experiences, both in and out of rehab.  One gets the impression that he has not completely rid himself of his rage.  I disagree with his decisions not to adopt the 12 step program which has worked for so many.  I also reject his refusal to turn to God for help.  I pray that his arrogance doesn't land him in trouble again.  I know there is peace and compassion to be found in the presence of God, and I hope James comes to know Him.
B000BNX3B4|1.0|An example of a script that really went to the dogs.  I had read the book, which was mediocre, but when I saw that the premise had been updated for Internet dating, the changes sounded promising.  While the Internet dating thing didn't really add to the story in the end, putting some focus on Cusack's character's side of the plot kind of did.<br /><br />Overall there was too much to the film that was too thinly sketched.  For example:  Cusack's character, Jake is a boat maker who crafts his boats like an artist for a market that no longer exists.  I am sure the filmmaker was trying to say something about appreciation for the quaint and old-fashioned, (his character also loves old movies) but the message didn't really come across with any meaning.  Throughout the whole film, much is made about how Jake has yet to sell a boat.  Okay, so where's his money come from then?<br /><br />A love triangle kind of develops between Lane, Mulrooney and Cusack, but the triangle is so obtuse that it just doesn't ring true. Arguments spring up simply to enable the plot, so that they make no sense to the viewer, and the female lead comes off like she's either crazy or suffering from PMS.<br /><br />To be fair, Lane and Cusack try hard to work with the material they're given, but that's tough when none of it seems based in reality. The romance hardly works, and as for the comedy, there were more smirks than laughs here.  The plot is narrow, and none of the supporting characters have any kind of personality or story to them.  The writers should have boiled the main character's siblings down to just one, or perhaps one of each because there were too many to keep track of, and not enough jobs for them to do.<br /><br />As for the dogs, two come in and out of the picture for no reason, (or perhaps just to add a little \\"cute\\") and at no particular interval whatsoever, much like  Christopher Plummer's laughable (not to mention - completely cliche-riddled) Irish brogue.<br /><br />Pick this one up with a pooper scooper.
0385510454|4.0|I am a die-hard fan of John Grisham, maybe because we're both from the south.  I loved The Broker.  I found the suspense to be exhilirating and was fascinated by the idea of having your life depend on fitting in perfectly to a strange, but beautiful new culture.  Next to Rainmaker, I think this might be my favorite book by John Grisham.  It is great fun.
B0002RNXNM|4.0|\\"Kasabian\\" may not be extremely original (though different than most bands today) and some of the songs aren't that good, but overall the pros far outweigh the cons. If you've heard anything about the band then you've probably heard the songs \\"Reason Is Treason\\", \\"Club Foot\\" or \\"L.S.F.\\". If you liked any of those songs then you should definitely pick up the album because you're going to love the rest of it. Sometimes the lyrics are cheesy and childish, but you won't really mind (in other words, you won't be ashamed that you're playing this album). Lead singer Tom Meighan is pretty much perfect for the band's style (I'm not sure how to describe him but you'll understand). The songs are also very groovy and I suppose you could say pretty \\"cool\\" sounding. The only problem with the album is that the lyrics aren't that good and the songs feel produced (i.e. there arguably seems to be a lack of personality or soul here). Some of the tracks aren't that good but most of them are dead-on. I'm giving it \\"4.5\\" stars because of its slight uniqueness in today's music and for the fact that it has so many good songs on it (and also because the singer is very appealing). If you're looking for a cool new mellow album to groove to, you're gonna love \\"Kasabian\\". Highly recommended!     Highlights include:   \\"Club Foot\\"   \\"Processed Beats\\"   \\"Reason Is Treason\\"   \\"I.D.\\" (to an extent)   \\"L.S.F.\\"   \\"Running Battle\\" (sort of)   \\"Pinch Roller\\"   \\"Cutt Off\\"   \\"Butcher Blues\\"   \\"Ovary Stripe\\"   \\"U Boat\\" (parts of it)
B00008AWOG|5.0|... but I'll try anyway. First off, I am not a raving Opeth fanboy. I once used to hate this genre of music (couldn't stand the vocals) - before becoming a Opeth fan (just like most of their other fans). \\"Damnation\\" was the gateway album for me, followed by \\"Blackwater Park\\", \\"Morningrise\\" and this one.<br /><br />Opeth's music is well-known for its dynamics (mix of acoustic and heavy metal sections). Of all the Opeth material I've listened to so far, the transitions between the acoustic and heavy sections play very well in this album than any other. Morningrise had great acoustic and metal sections, but I thought that some transitions between sections were a little too abrupt - just my opinion. Now, to the actual album review ...<br /><br />In short, Still Life is a concept album describing the story of a man (the narrator) who is banished from his village because his beliefs were different from those of the other villagers. He comes back to the village after 15 years to find his love interest Melinda (\\"The Moor\\") - hoping the villagers won't recognize him (\\"Godhead's Lament\\"). He manages to find her and tries to convince her to come away with him (\\"Benigted\\"). To his dissapointment, he finds Melinda married to another man. He still decides to have her back (\\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\", \\"Face of Melinda\\"), but something goes wrong in the middle and Melida ends up dead (\\"Serenity Painted Death\\"). Filled with rage, he goes medieval on the villagers (the councilmen, especially), until he is finally caught and is awaiting to be put to death (\\"White Cluster\\").<br /><br />If I had to describe the first song \\"The Moor\\" in just two words, it would be this : Striking Dynamics. This song has it all. It has one of the greatest intros one could hope for in a metal song (just listen to it and you'll know why). A few amazing riffs, lyrics and a short acoustic break later, the song enters into a dreamy and beautifully crafted acoustic section, where Mikael displays his \\"other\\" vocal talent - after which the song ends in the same heavy note that it started. The amazing thing about this song is that it vividly portrays the picture of a man running swiftly through a moor (an open area filled with peat bogs) trying to get back into the village he was banished from (try to open up your imagination a little bit and you will immensely enjoy this song).<br /><br />The second song, \\"Godheads Lament\\" is a monstrously heavy track with amazing riffs (er ... that description applies to just about any Opeth song). But, the highlight of this track is the bizarrely catchy rock section in the middle (the paragraph starting with \\"Searching my way ...\\"). Throughout this song, the narrator is trying his best to disguise himself so that that the villagers won't recognize him, and continuing his search for Melinda. He manages to find her at the end of the song (\\"In crumbling faith I saw her ...\\").<br /><br />The third track, \\"Benighted\\" is a soothing all-acoustic track with a simple verse/chorus song structure. This song has an amazing outro, and it provides a much needed break after the sonic assault unleashed by the first two tracks. In this song, the narrator tries his best to convince Melinda to come with him.<br /><br />The fourth track, \\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\" is my personal favorite thanks to some truly colossal riffs, and a positive and uplifiting (terms not usually associated with Opeth) chorus section at the end. This song carries the story forward, and is about the narrator's disdain for the village councilmen and his desire to protect Melinda from them.<br /><br />The fifth track, \\"Face of Melinda\\" is something that anyone with any appreciation of rock music will enjoy. The first half of this song is acoustic, and it explodes at the end with some of the best guitar riffs I've had the pleasure of lending my ears to. A bizzare thing about this song is the entirely straightforward (yet poetic) lyrics that is unlike most other Opeth songs. During this track, the narrator painfully learns of Melinda's  marriage to a another man, but still has difficulty giving her up. Melinda's stand on all this is clearly represented in the song's final lyric: \\"My promise is made, but my heart is thine\\". This song also features an amazing outro riff.<br /><br />The sixth track, \\"Serenity Painted Death\\". Well, if \\"The Moor\\" had the best dynamics, then this track has the best variety. This track starts with two 'amazing/epic/melodic/sad/heavy' riffs that Opeth can now come up with in their sleep. These give way to a 80's Sabbath style mid-tempo heavy riff that is almost impossible to avoid headbanging to. It gives way to a bizarre hiphop-style (gasp!) section where Mikael almost raps (gasp!) the paragraph \\"White face, ...\\", and the guitar almost does a turn-table like (another gasp!) sound. The heavy riffs continue and out of nowhere comes a Dream Theateresque epic solo and a chorus section. The song then enters a brief acoustic break, before exploding into a monstrously heavy section (the heaviest on this album) - with some violent lyrics. Then comes another epic solo that wouldn't sound too out of place on a Dream Theater album, followed by another chorus section, before ending with the \\"White face ..\\" paragraph. I know that I am not doing any justice to this song by attemping to describe it like this, but all I am trying to say is that you can tear apart this one Opeth song, make 10 normal metal songs, and probably even release a hit metal album. This track is when the narrator finds Melinda dead and goes medieval on the village councilmen before losing his strength and getting caught.<br /><br />The final track, \\"White Cluster\\" has been my least favorite track on this album for a while simply because I am always exhausted by the time I reach this track (I usually dont play this album out of order). This is another amazing Opeth song and if you loved the previous tracks you will love this one too. In this track, the narrator is awaiting this death by hanging (\\"The noose is tied ...\\").<br /><br />I have always believed that music has three dimensions: Virtuosity, Complexity and Melody/Emotivity. I am on this eternal quest to find music that has significant presence in all the three dimensions. After listening to this album, I can now safely say that there is atleast one band in the world that has come close to achieving this three-dimensional musical brilliance.

B000003TBP|5.0|Though the album is very uneven with a lot of ok songs, as a whole \\"Odelay\\" is a great album. There are three Lo-Fi classics here - \\"Devil's Haircut\\", \\"Hotwax (which wasn't a hit), and \\"Where It's At\\". Not only does this make it accessible for non-Beck fans, but it makes the album that much more worth buying. Very creative with a lot of soul put into it. Its historical influence adds a lot of value to it and helps make it worth buying. Although \\"Guero\\" and \\"Mutations\\" are more satisfying as a whole (they contain no filler), \\"Odelay\\" is still a great record. Three factors give it a 5-star rating - the 3 classic songs, its creativity and its historical influence. Recommended!    Highlights include:  \\"Devil's Haircut\\"  \\"Hotwax\\"  \\"Lord Only Knows\\"  \\"The New Pollution\\"  \\"Novacane\\"  \\"Where It's At\\"  \\"Minus\\" (to an extent)  \\"Readymade\\" (sort of)
B00005JOFO|5.0|I went to see Brokeback Mountain not really knowing what to expect. I had heard about it on the radio, on TV, and even in Saturday Night Live skits--and I had to see what all the buzz was about. So I picked up the short story by Annie Proulx (which was FANTASTIC) and then headed to the theater. I am so glad that I went to see this film! <br /> <br />Brokeback is, as everyone already knows, the story of two \\"gay cowboys\\" who fall in love one summer in Wyoming. But really, that is only the surface of what this film is truly about. At its core, Brokeback is a romance that focuses on repressed love, longing, and the struggles of relationships. For these reasons, I believe that it can be relatable to anyone, gay or straight. It is also a film about acceptance--and the pressures society places on all individuals to conform to whatever is considered \\"normal.\\" These are obstacles that we all face in today's world--and this film sends a powerful message about the need to respect all people (even if they are different from ourselves). <br /> <br />The performances by Heath and Jake are extraordinary, the scenery is fantastic, and Gustavo Santaolalla's score is beautifully haunting. The love, pain, and desire that all of the characters feel is completely believable; I hope that this film is given major attention at Oscar time. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this film, but it is certainly not for everyone. Open-mindedness is a must!!! Also, a warning: Expect to leave the theater feeling like you've been shot through the heart...and expect this film to stay with you for a very long time afterward!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" has THE best dance-influenced pop music ever made, period. Whether you like him or not doesn't matter, you can at least recognize how great the songs are. There are so many classics on here it's staggering (\\"Thriller\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billy Jean\\"...the list goes on). Not to mention that Jackson's live act was tremendous. His music videos also helped stretch the limits of what could be done (as opposed to 99% of mindless music videos out today, these were incredibly stroy-driven and entertaining). There are about 1 or 2 songs that aren't as good as these monster hits, but they're still very very good. The remastering is also particularly well done here (though it would've been better to put the interviews on a separate disc). I find it hard to believe that anyone who likes pop won't love this album. Highly recommended along with \\"Off The Wall\\" (though not as strongly) and \\"Bad\\"!    Highlights include:  everything except for the last two tracks (which aren't bad)
1577314808|4.0|My husband bought this book for me and I probably would not have picked it out for myself.  Not knowing anything about the book, I was slow to start reading and get into it.  Now I am happy that I have read the book.  If nothing else, it has expanded my tools for self-help.  The examples it gives are relatable and promote spiritual calmness.  I have used the tools from the book in my moments of stress and worry.  Even though it is somewhat redundant throughout the book, I felt enlightened.
B000006045|5.0|\\"Mezzanine\\" is another classic album by the legendary group Massive Attack, and I would even argue that it's better (there aren't any bad songs and the best songs here are simply extraordinary)! The best tracks are the first four songs which deliver a 1-2-3-4 of such creative genius that it'll instantly make you a fan. Sometimes relaxing, sometimes haunting, and always groovy, \\"Mezzanine\\" delivers a worthwhile follow-up to \\"Blue Lines\\" that \\"Protection\\" failed to be. Like \\"Blue Lines\\", \\"Mezzanine\\" features several singers who are ALL very likable and charismatic (\\"Blue Lines\\" suffered from the track \\"One Love\\" where the singer arguably kind of ruined the song). The lyrics aren't as memorable as on \\"Blue Lines\\", though, but you won't mind. Overall it's a much darker album than \\"Blue Lines\\" as it occasionally blends metal and industrial music with their trip-hop sound. Hip-hop and probably casual music fans will love this album. A word for the wise: the rest of the album might take a bit before you  realize how good it is. Anyways - very highly recommended along with their first album \\"Blue Lines\\" and Portishead's \\"Portishead\\" (though this one isn't as good).    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000BNX3B4|4.0|I really wasn't all that interested in seeing this movie because it seemed like something a middle-aged woman would watch with a box of Oreos (no offense). But, in that respect, I really think they short-changed the film in the advertising. <br /> <br />Anyway, Sarah is newly divorced and her overly-involved family is pressuring her to get back into the dating scene. Coming out of a marriage where she was \\"content\\" but not \\"happy,\\" she's a little hesitant to get back into the dating scene. <br /> <br />Jake, her love interest, is also just coming out of a divorce (usually a recipe for disaster). The hero wants the whole enchilada, the love of his life, the ONE. <br /> <br />Sarah meets Jake through an online dating site and their first date is pretty much a disaster because he comes on too strong--not sexually, it's just that he has this strong, vibrant personality that's a little disconcerting for Sarah. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Sarah's also sort of dating the father of one of her pre-school students who's ex-wife describes him as \\"an incorrigible flirt.\\" <br /> <br />Yet, Sarah dates him anyway, much to her regret, eventually. <br /> <br />There's also a sub-plot involving her father and his search for companionship after the death of his wife, the \\"love of his life.\\" <br /> <br />All in all, this film has an underlying sense of loves that are \\"meant to be,\\" and that's really the only thing that I found eyebrow raising. <br /> <br />It's not so much the chemistry between Jake and Sarah that makes this a great film, but it's kind of an inspiring take on life after divorce. <br /> <br />There's a sense of coincidence (i.e., her student's father living next door to her father's new love interest; her father, unknowingly, has a conversation with Jake on a street corner, etc. and so forth). The witty, heartfelt dialogue is charming and the feel-good aspect kind of reminds me of \\"Love Actually,\\" in the sense that both films give a realistic view of the ugly side of love,but also give hope for finding it again.
B00005QGAT|5.0|As opposed to \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad\\", \\"Off The Wall\\" has a lot of merely \\"ok\\" tracks (it's pretty uneven). After \\"Get On The Floor\\" its magic tends to fall apart. As always with Michael, though, the highlights are timeless classics. The greatest achievement this album had is fusing disco with pop which made it much more accessible outside of a dance environment (and every song features some neat and different instrumentation even if the entire song isn't that great). Like the other two remasterings this one is great, but once again keep the interviews on a separate disc please, Sony!! If you love Michael Jackson or pop music you can't go wrong with \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\" or \\"Bad\\" (and its historical influence adds to its value). If it weren't for its historical importance I think I would've given it a \\"4.5\\". Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  \\"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough\\"  \\"Rock With You\\"  \\"Working Day & Night\\"  \\"Get On The Floor\\"
B00005JOFO|5.0|I've read several of the reviews here, the ones that sing the praises of this movie.  They speak more eloquently than I can.  I concur that this is a gem of a movie.  Also, its a tragic love tale that happens to be about gay men.  The night after seeing the movie, I couldnt sleep.  The no win situation of the characters from the start, the lives of the women they marry and the kids they father, its as tragic as any classical greek piece could be.  I also wonder, as did another reader, how a short story that takes an hour to read could be extended to a 2 hour movie, but it flows well.  I've purposely not gone to see it a second time because when I do, I want to give it my full attention again.  Its stellar.  This is the stuff that great filmmaking accomplishes.
B00005QGAX|5.0|\\"Bad\\" may not be as monumental as \\"Thriller\\", but it's just as entertaining (and WAY better than most albums on sale). Unfortunately there's a couple filler tracks on here like \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" and \\"Liberian Girl\\", but the rest are so good you won't care in the end. Like \\"Thriller\\", there are numerous classics on here including the hits \\"Bad\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\" which are essential to any pop collection. The remastering is, again, very well done, but, like \\"Thriller\\", the interviews should really be on a separate disc. Michael is still on top of his game here in the mid-80's, and he definitely doesn't disappoint. If you loved \\"Thriller\\", then you'll love \\"Bad\\". The main difference between the two is that \\"Bad\\" is angrier and more agressive. I can't recommend this (and \\"Thriller\\") highly enough!    Highlights include:  \\"Bad\\"  \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\"  \\"Speed Demon\\"  \\"Another Part Of Me\\"  \\"Man In The Mirror\\"  \\"Dirty Diana\\"  \\"Smooth Criminal\\"  \\"Leave Me Alone\\"
B00001OH7U|5.0|After the death of the glittery Ziggy Stardust Bowie unveils his new persona: a mystical, cocaine fuelled and almost fascist character called the Thin White Duke.  <br /> <br />'Station to Station' draws from the blue eyed soul of Bowie's previous album 'Young Americans' and combines it with the European avant-gardism of groups such as Kraftwerk. The album flows in a funky but also robotic way. The lyrics are very dark and sometimes terrifying, reflecting Bowie's desperate and paranoid state of mind. They also show an intense interest in spiritual themes, whether Chrisitianity or the teachings of Aleister Crowley and the occult.   <br />  <br />The title track begins with the sound of a train moving and menacing piano chords. Bowie begins by introducing his newest character and alluding to the stations of the cross. Halfway through this song the tempo speeds up and Bowie sounds joyous yet hysterical in a crazed addict kind of way. In my opinion, this one of Bowie's finest moments. The next song, 'Golden Years' was the only single released on the album. It's funky and finger-snapping cool with the vocal sommersaulting from octave to octave. Bowie is desperately crooning and pleading for spiritual connection in 'Word on a Wing', complete with organ and angelic backing vocals. The only lighthearted song on the album is 'TVC 15', with hilarious lyrics about someone's girlfriend being sucked up by a TV!  'Stay' showcases Bowie's backing band, it has a tremendous guitar solo and groove in the rhythm section. Bowie gives one of his best ever vocal performances on his cover of 'Wild is the Wind.' He sounds like he's swooning as he stretches syllables to their maximum limit.  <br /> <br />This is one of my very favourite Bowie albums- as an avid fan with more than 15 albums, I'd put this in my top 3. Very highly recommended, this is a desert island disc for me. Do yourself a favour and check this one out.
B000001OAA|5.0|In a way \\"Garbage\\" is a slightly cheesy album (mostly for \\"Only When It Rains\\"), but there are many great and slightly original songs here that that fact essentially doesn't matter. Not every song is great, but the ones that aren't are pretty decent. 90's grunge fans will especially appreciate it. Sonically it sounds like it was heavily influenced by My Bloody Valentine, Curve, and Sonic Youth. The female vocalist sounds pretty intense compared to what most people are probably used to (it fits the music). Except for the obvious hit-worthy tracks \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" and \\"Queen\\", I'm not sure if it has mass appeal (although they DO do a darn good job of trying to popularize the genre). The reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because A: its relative uniqueness to other bands, B: it's pretty interesting musically and lyrically and C: the two hits, \\"Queer\\" and \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\", plus the number of good grunge/shoegaze songs on here. Open-minded listeners and fans of the genre/band will definitely enjoy it (even if some songs might take a while to like). Not a must-have but definitely recommended if you like the style!    Highlights include:  \\"Supervixen\\"  \\"Queen\\"  \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\"  \\"Vow\\"  \\"Stupid Girl\\"  \\"My Lover's Box\\"  \\"Fix Me Now\\"
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Along comes this DVD, on which you cannot skip the previews to get to the main feature. You can only \\"fast forward\\" them, as if this were video tape. When I'm sitting down to watch a DVD at home, there is nothing more annoying than a disc denying me access to the main menu and feature. Therefore this otherwise charming movie gets only one star from me.
B00079018K|4.0|\\"Kasabian\\" may not be extremely original (though different than most bands today) and some of the songs aren't that good, but overall the pros far outweigh the cons. If you've heard anything about the band then you've probably heard the songs \\"Reason Is Treason\\", \\"Club Foot\\" or \\"L.S.F.\\". If you liked any of those songs then you should definitely pick up the album because you're going to love the rest of it. Sometimes the lyrics are cheesy and childish, but you won't really mind (in other words, you won't be ashamed that you're playing this album). Lead singer Tom Meighan is pretty much perfect for the band's style (I'm not sure how to describe him but you'll understand). The songs are also very groovy and I suppose you could say pretty \\"cool\\" sounding. The only problem with the album is that the lyrics aren't that good and the songs feel produced (i.e. there arguably seems to be a lack of personality or soul here). Some of the tracks aren't that good but most of them are dead-on. I'm giving it \\"4.5\\" stars because of its slight uniqueness in today's music and for the fact that it has so many good songs on it (and also because the singer is very appealing). If you're looking for a cool new mellow album to groove to, you're gonna love \\"Kasabian\\". Highly recommended!     Highlights include:   \\"Club Foot\\"   \\"Processed Beats\\"   \\"Reason Is Treason\\"   \\"I.D.\\" (to an extent)   \\"L.S.F.\\"   \\"Running Battle\\" (sort of)   \\"Pinch Roller\\"   \\"Cutt Off\\"   \\"Butcher Blues\\"   \\"Ovary Stripe\\"   \\"U Boat\\" (parts of it)
B000002UC5|3.0|The bulk of Paul McCartney's first solo album sounds more like a collection of demos on which he plays all the instruments. As with most of Paul's early solo work, there are a lot of great riffs and melodies but, unfortunately, Sir Macca couldn't be bothered to write any real lyrics to most of them (many don't have any lyrics at all) which is a shame because, if they had been given more time and care, most of these songs could've become McCartney classics. Let's go down the list... <br /> <br />01) THE LOVELY LINDA: The album kicks off with this peppy lil' acoustic diddy which, sadly, ends after only 45 seconds! Missed opportunity for a classic #1. <br /> <br />02) THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING: This song could've been something if Paul didn't repeat the same phrase over and over again in lieu of giving us some actual lyrics. As it is, it sounds like an unfinished out take from \\"Let it Be\\". <br /> <br />03) VALENTINE DAY: This is a great funky / bluesy / rock groove that ends after only 1 minute and 44 seconds and has no lyrics. Missed opportunity for a classic #2. <br /> <br />04) EVERY NIGHT: This is the first HONEST-TO-GOODNESS FINISHED SONG on the album and it's a great one. A fantastic mid-tempo acoustic tune that could've fit nicely onto either \\"The White Album\\" or \\"Let it Be\\". <br /> <br />05) HOT AS SUN / GLASSES: This is the second of the numerous instrumentals and I personally like this one very much. It has an exuberantly happy vibe to it's acoustic guitar melody and much maraca shaking. <br /> <br />06) JUNK: Another song that was actually finished and it's a nice little acoustic guitar love song. <br /> <br />07) MAN WE WAS LONELY: This one is also finished and puts me in mind of \\"Two of Us\\" from \\"Let it Be\\". <br /> <br />08) OO YOU: This song could've ranked among greats like \\"Get Back\\" and \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" if, once again, Paul had simply written some worthy lyrics instead of just singing the first words that popped into his head. Missed opportunity fora classic #3...and the biggest. <br /> <br />09) MOMMA MISS AMERICA: I really really dig this song. It's another instrumental but this one completely swings. You can tell that Paul is having a blast jamming with himself on this tune. Great piano banging and super bouncy bass lines swirling wonderfully with some rather funky drumming and rockin' guitar licks make this one of my faves. <br /> <br />10) TEDDY BOY: I hate this song. It isn't necessarily a bad song per se, it's just one of Paul's UBER CUTESY tunes that I can't stand. Kinda like \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\". <br /> <br />11) SINGALONG JUNK: This is a rather pointless instrumental version of song #6. FILLER! <br /> <br />12) MAYBE I'M AMAZED: Now this is Paul at his best! None of the love songs Paul would write in future years would ever come close to the greatness of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\". Even his Beatle classics like \\"Hey Jude\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and \\"Let it Be\\" pale (a bit) in comparison. MASTERPIECE! <br /> <br />13) KREEN - AKRORE: No this isn't a character from \\"Lord of the Rings\\". This is a bit of self-indulgent sound collage noodling  that closes the album. MORE FILLER! <br /> <br />Overall, \\"McCARTNEY\\" is a \\"OK\\" album but \\"it could've been a contender...it coulda been somebody\\" if only all the songs had been given the inspired quality production of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\".
B000000WHX|5.0|With their classic \\"Blue Lines\\" Massive Attack introduced trip-hop into the world with an extremely entertaining and mostly consistent album (the track \\"One Love\\" is the weakest one - the guy's voice really gets annoying). This kind of album falls into the league as The Beatles first albums and Run-D.M.C.'s \\"Run-D.M.C.\\" in terms of how influential it was to the music industry. Every track here is not only original but also very entertaining. There's about 4 or 5 different vocalists that appear throughout the album, and although the one off \\"One Love\\" is arguably the weakest, the rest are very good (Tricky is my personal favorite, he does the \\"Blue Lines\\" song). The lyrics are also very good - you'll end up liking a lot of the songs in that regard. If you're a hip-hop fan you'll love this album. If you are a casual music fan there's a high probability you'll love this album. A highly influential album that hasn't aged a day (although the sound quality could use a remastering). Definitely recommended! If you like this you'll love their other album \\"Mezzanine\\" and most likely Portishead's \\"Portishead\\". <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />everything except for \\"One Love\\" (it's annoying) and \\"Lately\\"
B0007OCG4W|5.0|...or lack thereof. <br /> <br />This movie observes how four individuals are shattered by their relationships.  The devastating effects of deception are portrayed convincingly and heartbreakingly by these four talented actors.   <br /> <br />There are many memorable lines that ring true in real-world relationships, mostly spoken by Natalie Portman's character. <br /> <br />Some people I've spoken with objected to the explicit sexual dialogue (too 'shocking') and the lack of any 'action' sequences in the movie (it rides solely on dialogue), so it's not exactly the most universal movie release. However, the dialogue is poignant and memorable, and the movie needs nothing added to it.   <br /> <br />All in all, superbly written and well-acted.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|\\"Is This It\\" was a pretty hard album to beat, and I think they realized that. \\"Room On Fire\\" is similar, but not in a way where you think \\"hey this is just 'Is This It' but with more songs\\". Like the first album, \\"Room On Fire\\" contains no filler and is pretty much just as enjoyable (it's very much a foot-tapper). Like \\"Is This It\\", \\"Room On Fire\\" also has a bunch of hit-worthy songs that help make it appealing to the masses (\\"Reptilia\\" for example). Every song is laced with a very catchy beat or guitar hook and they mostly contain interesting lyrics, although Julian still sounds kind of emotionless most of the time. Nevertheless, if you like rock or are a fan of The Strokes you'll most likely enjoy this album. Recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
0393317552|5.0|This ambitious book by Diamond, a geography professor, is an attempt to answer a question posed by a friend of his from Papua New Guinea, on why white people brought cargo to New Guinea, but the black people of New Guinea had little cargo of their own.  Diamond expands on this slightly oddly worded question to try to explain why various societies are the way they are, and what happens when they come into contact.  For example, Diamond ponders why European states colonized the New World and the Native American population, rather than Native Americans crossing the Atlantic to colonize Europe. <br /> <br />Diamond attributes much of the current structure and results of conflict between different people to geography.  He largely assumes an environmental determinism, that the environment of a particular society strongly affects its ability to produce food, to development technical innovations, to develop immunity to disease, to trade effectively with its neighbors, and to wage war.  I am not an expert in this sort of field, but I found most of Diamonds arguments pretty convincing. <br /> <br />For example, crop cultivation on the Eurasian landmass was enhanced through its long east-west axis, where the climate is relatively similar throughout.  Thus, a crop cultivated somewhere along the Eurasian landmass could quickly migrate to other nearby regions along the east-west axis.  Contrast this with the African or North-South American landmasses, which are oriented with long North-South axis, and are broken up with deserts.  It is difficult for crop cultivated in one area to migrate to other areas of these landmasses.  This provided an advantage Eurasian societies had over those in Africa and the New World, and a major factor as to why these land masses were largely colonized by European states. <br /> <br />Could there be other innate factors unrelated to geography but more to psychological make-up of humans on different parts of the globe that shape human history?  Diamonddoes not totally discount that, as he sprinkles in a couple of examples of different societies in similar environments having some different characteristics.  However, Diamond claims that if Australian aborigines where interchanged with European peoples in 5000 BC, the transplanted aborigines would still end up colonizing the transplanted Europeans living in Australia.  Those that have trouble with this philosophical point of view are probably going to think a lot less of this book, but Diamond makes his ideas fairly convincing, and backs up this world view with a number of examples that greatly outnumber the rare counterexamples. <br /> <br />Needless to say, an attempt to characterize human history and explain why the world is the way it is today is not the type of book one reads during an afternoon at the beach.  However, I found most of the book surprisingly easy to read, and at around 450 pages, fairly digestable.  It has moments where Diamond's writing is a little unclear, and gets a bit tedious to read.  But I learned a lot, and felt I gained a much greater appreciation of the world by reading it. <br /> <br />
1401206905|3.0|I enjoyed Batman: Year One, but was not overwhelmed by the book.  I had read Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, and was interested in reading more of his work. <br /> <br />While DKR was deep and textured, Year One felt hurried and rushed. Though both stories are told in 4 books, the style used in DKR allows much more information and nuance to be placed on each page.  The pages in Year One are less cluttered, and look better overall, but also convey less information. <br /> <br />The story should seem familiar to anybody who's seen the recent Batman Begins movie, as the filmmakers cite this as one of their influences.  Bruce Wayne, by this point a young man, comes back to Gotham City and begins to purge it of evil.  At the same time, Lieutenant Gordon of the Gotham City PD begins a crusade to clean up the city from within.  Also added to the mix is the enigmatic Selina Kyle, a dominatrix/cat burglar, interested in getting what's hers.  All three find themselves up against the criminal empire of Carmine \\"The Roman\\" Falcone, head of Gotham's underworld. <br /> <br />The story follows the development of these three main characters into the characters we are familiar with today.  The story is an interesting one, but again, feels too rushed - 4 books just doesn't seem long enough to cover a year's worth of story. <br /> <br />If you enjoyed this book, or are interested in Batman's early years, I recommend Batman: The Long Halloween, by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale.  Taking place a few years after Year One, it features many of the same gangster characters that inhabit this story, but also features classic villains such as The Joker, Scarecrow, and Two-Face.  It tells a year-long story in 13 episodes - a more appropriate length. <br /> <br />In the end, it was a good, though short, story of Batman's beginning.
B00005JOIF|3.0|\\"Munich\\" tells the story of Avner (Eric Bana), who is chosen by Israeli's prime minister, Golda Meir, to avenge the hostage taking and murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games. Avner leads a group of operatives whose mission is to track down and assassinate 11 Palestinian leaders wanted by the Israeli government for planning attacks of terroism. Avner discovers a French contact who, for a price, gives him the location of the intended targets. Avner and his men then seek out and murder the Palestinians. Often bombs are planted to create a heightened sense of \\"terror\\".  <br /> <br />What distinguishes this movie from being just another action flick, besides the much better acting and overall high quality of filmmaking, is that the operatives are constantly afflicted by self-doubt and their own conscience as to whether their violent acts are justified. The movie itself doesn't really offer a definite answer to this question. Instead it discusses the various hopes and fears motivating both the Palestinians and the Israelis, especially the mutually shared desire for a national homeland. The movie also talks about the cycle of violence being perpetuated and asks whether this \\"eye for an eye\\" mentality is actually accomplishing anything. <br /> <br />These are all valid and important topics to discuss. But I do have to admit the movie itself left me kinda cold. It's hard to believe that the actual Israeli operatives that performed these killings did anywhere near the amount of moral \\"kvetching\\" of the characters portrayed in this movie. They were hired assassins on a patriotically inspired mission after all. Also the film is a bit overlong, at nearly 3 hours, and has that typically Spielberg style of \\"epic masterpiece\\" that I find  to be sometimes pretentious and overwrought. This is especially true of the almost ridiculous scene near the end where Avner dramatically agonizes over his violent actions while having sex with his wife. Finally, I found it ironicthat a film whose theme has to done with the futility of violence to achieve a lasting peace relys so heavily on a series of very violent killings to fuel its plotline. In fact, without these murders to create the action and excitement the film itself wouldn't exist at all or, at the very least, would be a terrible bore. So is violence ever the solution? I wouldn't count on this movie to answer that question.
B000002IZ4|2.0|This album sounds pretty good the first few times you listen to it but it grows old fast. It just seems to be style over substance, Vaseline and Big Empty are the only tracks that have much lasting appeal. For me, STP were the most over-rated grunge band back in the early 90s. Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Smashing Pumpkins (not really grunge but around at the same time) are all far more enjoyable. <br /> <br />I do like Velvet Revolver though. So if you like Velvet Revolver dont assume you'll like this STP album.
0321200683|5.0|This book was exactly what I was looking for to help me scope an integration solution.  For me, patterns help solve, better understand, and therefore, better communicate the technical issues of a complex software project; an enterprise integration project is complex.  I was better able to communicate and estimate the scope of the project using EIPs as a GUIDE.  The pattern icons (and Viso stencils found on the links page of the web site) saved me tremendous amounts time and narrative in the design documents. <br /> <br />Patterns do not, in themselves, promote a technology.  Some of the reviews have been critical/complementary about the examples provided in the book that refer/don't refer to a specific technology.  If your goal for integration is to provide a \\"loosely coupled\\" solution, this book will first GUIDE you to a message based solution. <br /> <br />After I gathered the functional requirements (use cases) for my integration project, I used this book to GUIDE me through the design process.  Often during the design (and later in development) phase of any project, I struggle with a solution to a difficult technical problem.  That is where design patterns help me.  Has someone already solved this problem?  Ah, yes and look how they solved it, of course that is the way you'd do it!  Here is the design pattern and it's brilliant.  Patterns are technologically agnostic. <br /> <br />We were then able to use the design, based on EIPs, to GUIDE us through choosing the integration technologies that best allowed us to implement these patterns.
015626224X|5.0|This is one of the many books I bought just because of its small size, or because I had never known that such a book by such and such author ever existed. <br /> <br />This is a very humane book. It describes a few months in George Orwell's life when he literary had to live the life without a penny in his pocket. The struggle to survive, the friendships offered by totally destitute people, the way events spiraled to worse and worse until they started getting better, all this is a fascinating reading. The way Orwell identifies with people and understand their problem (because he himself was facing those himself) and his resolution toweards the end to do his bit to ease their daily sruggle (for example, his decision never to say no when a guy on the street hands him out a  handbill, because his getting paid may depend on his distributing the whole bunch of them) are all worth reading. I started this book as a pretty much ignorant man about the plight of the down and out section of the society, and by the time I finished it, I leanred a thing or two about them. It has been almost four years since I read this book, and I have never again refused to accept a handbill handed to me by a fellow standing on the roadside; I'm sure I will continue to do so. And I owe that to somweone named Eric Blair. <br /> <br />However, the only negative point of this book is Orwell's very negative view about an old Jewish person and his activities. I am not sure if this is just an individual case, where he hates a person and refers to him in not-so-friendly terms, or if reflects the growing blatant anti-semitism (this book was perhaps written sometime in the 1930's) that would sweep Europe within a few years!

B00003CXSP|5.0|\\"Hannibal\\" is a film that many reviewers have mixed opinions on. Some call it a worthy if inferior sequel to \\"The Silence Of The Lambs\\", while others say it doesn't serve to share the name Hannibal Lecter. I, however, am going to opt with the former category. While nowhere near as good as \\"The Silence Of The Lambs\\", I still found \\"Hannibal\\" to be highly enjoyable.<br /><br />The best way to view \\"Hannibal\\" is as a stand alone film. Despite a few references to the previous film, the only real similarity to the film is that the character of Hannibal Lecter (played brilliantly once more by Anthony Hopkins) is in it. Yes, Clarice Starling does indeed return (played here by Julianne Moore, who makes for a servicable replacement for Jodie Foster), but she is a very different character in this film. She is much more vulnerable and afraid this time around, thanks to a series of tragic events in her personal life.<br /><br />The film picks up 10 years after the events of \\"TSOTL\\". The notorious killer Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter has taken solace in Venice, where he works at an art museum. His life seems to be going well. Thousands of miles away, things are going just the opposite for FBI agent Clarice Starling. After a drug bust goes terribly wrong, a public backlash against Clarice breaks out, causing disdain for her within the bureau, especially with the smarmy Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta, who is somewhat wasted in his role). However, Clarice gets a chance when Mason Verger (an uncredited Gary Oldman, whose wonderful acting abilities become buried beneath his overdramatic makeup job), Hannibal's only surviving victim, offers Clarice new info on Hannibal's whereabouts. Turns out Verger is not the only one interested in Clarice, as the good doctor himself is willing to reconnect with his old friend. There is another one who's interested in Lecter. Italian police officer Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) has learned that there is $ 3, 000, 000 reward for the capture of Doctor Lecter, and is out to get it. Of course, his plan backfires, and an encounter with the good doctor leaves him a little, er, hung over. Lecter then returns to the United States to catch up with Miss Starling, who has been suspended from the force. This leads to an intense cat and mose game between Starling and Lecter. Mr. Verger, of course, has plans of his own as well. He enlists Krendler and his men to kidnap Lecter and feed him to a pack of wild boars. Clarice manages to rescue Doctor Lecter from a most terrible fate, and Lecter returns the favor with a candlelight dinner. Also present is Mr. Krendler. What happens to Mr. Krendler is not worth explaining in words. In the end, Dr. Lecter escapes once more, and the ending will leave you with shivers down your spine.<br /><br />While nowhere near as good as \\"The Silence Of The Lambs\\", \\"Hannibals\\" still serves up some genuine chills. In fact, while I do consider the previous film the better of the two, I do consider \\"Hannibal\\" the more disturbing one, mostly because director Ridley Scott upped the gore factor considerably. The performances are rich and full of life. Hopkins is once again perfect as Dr. Lecter. The film does have some flaws though. For starters, Ray Liotta, as I said earlier, is wasted as Krendler. Also, Gary Oldman, while an amazing actor, doesn't get the chance to show off his abilites as the audiences focuses too much on his makeup job, which is very over the top and could've been toned down. (Personally, I would have liked to have seen what Christopher Reeve, who was originally offered the part, could've done in the role).<br /><br />The dvd is crammed with extras. The film is great and I highly recommend to most people, though if you're squeamish, I suggest skipping it.cter, and is out to get it.

B00005JNBQ|3.0|Napoleon Dynamite doesn't have too much of a plot to start with; A high-school geek and his friend try to find a girl who will want to go to the school dance with them sums it up in a nutshell. There are still lots of laughs to be had throught the movie anyway. The fact that no matter what the situation, the same wierd expression on Napoleon's face never changes got a lot of laughs out of me. I watched it with a group of people of many ages and they all found something they liked in this movie. The younger kids thought things like Napoleon's uncle takeing a self-defense class and the old farmer shooting his cow (with a school bus driving past and covering the scene) were funny, and everyone was laughing when Napoleon started danceing for his friend Pedro's class presidential election skit. There are many great things for the casual viewer to enjoy, but don't come anywhere near this movie if your looking for something with a Lord of the Rings plot depth. I don't think I would pay to see it again, but I wouldn't necessarily avoid it.

B0000YWKHC|1.0|Perhaps more than any other, this is the movie I consider wholy underserving of its unanimous critical acclaim. I don't usually find it difficult to appreciate off-beat films on an artistic or intellectual level, but what this movie lacked in its ability to entertain (which is to say, none whatsoever), it failed to make up for in substance. I was unable to forge any sort of emotional connection with its two protagonists, and Sofia Coppola's script was sparse to the point of irritation. One of my most joyless and insipid movie watching experiences in recent memory.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|If there is a Music of the Spheres, then Cecilia Bartoli should sing along with its harmonies. With the historical contents of this CD, opera fragments banned by the Roman Church in the early 18th. Century Rome, comes the fabulous voice of Cecilia Bartoli. Some compositions, like Lascia La Spina and Un pensiero nemico di pace, both by Haendel, will force you to hear them time after time thanks to the inspiration and hevenly virtuoso performances of Bartoli. Encore, please, encore...

As a guitar player, I know a good guitarist when I hear one and John Mayer IS a talented guitar player. John Mayer may be a passable guitarist, but he is a horrible singer and a mediocre songwriter...I think he stinks. He needs to shut his mouth and just play guitar. [...]
B000002UWL|5.0|I never grow tired of listening to this album.  It moves me now as much as it did back in the summer of 1991 -- it was the conclusion of my freshman year in college, and I stayed up all night to pack up my dorm room.  Everyone else had already left, so I cranked up the stereo and played this album in \\"repeat\\" mode while I worked.  The music was a perfect accompaniment and reflection of my mood: relief from having survived my first year of college and being on my own, yet sadness from departing from my newfound friends.    Somehow the Pet Shop Boys' perfect blend of vocals, synth and orchestra sounds in \\"Behavior\\" manages to intensify whatever emotions you are experiencing at the time, and evokes the memories later on.  It is definitely a departure from the disco material that the PSB had done previously (and afterwards), but it is truly effective and groundbreaking material.  You can tell that the boys put their heart and soul into this one.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Right now, I'd have to say that Peter Jackson is at the top of his game, and must feel like he's on top of the world. After winning Oscars for his labour of love, the Lord of the Rings, he got to turn his attention back to making his childhood fantasy, a remake of King Kong.<br /><br />And it shows, in all the little details.<br /><br />The music from the original King Kong was used in the scene on Broadway, when King is revealed to the audience. They actors playing the natives in that scene are wearing the same style costumes that were worn by the \\"actual natives\\" in the original. A lot of attention was paid to making New York look like it did in the original movie, whenever possible. Many of the scenes are lifted from the original movie. The last line definitely is.<br /><br />At the same time, Jackson is true to his roots. Some of the horrifying scenes and cinematography hearken back to his days making horror movies (such as the first encounter with all of the skulls on the island).<br /><br />I also liked the sly references that occurred from time to time. For instance, the director (played by Jack Black) has to go with Ann Darrow (played by Naomi Watts), because Fay Wray is unavailable, making a movie for RKO (which would have been the original King Kong, if you think about it).<br /><br />So, with all this attention to detail, how could I not love this movie? It's a great popcorn movie, with a great supporting cast (the cast is all supporting Kong, after all). The special effects are fluid and believable, and the music score works well. Andy Serkis deserves special note, for researching out how gorillas move about, and he's captured it well in his portrayal of Kong.<br /><br />It's definitely worth seeing. It may be a little too scary for small children. It's long, at roughly three hours, so go to the bathroom before the movie starts.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I bought this album from iTunes. The iTunes DRM is a whole hell of a lot less restrictive than that which comes \\"included\\" on this CD.  <br /> <br />The songs are great, don't boycott Coldplay because their record company is crap.  <br /> <br />Plus, I got a nifty video and some bonus tracks when I bought it from iTunes. And it cost about the same.
B00008OWZC|5.0|If you are a fan of Led Zeppelin - at all - this is a must have purchase, you won't be disappointed!!!!!  This is the best of the Zeppelin live discs followed closely by the BBC 2 disc set. <br /> <br />This set manages (somehow) to capture all the power and force that was a Led Zeppelin concert.  The 1973 and earlier tours were particularly amazing and this one is no exception, from the initial onslaught of Immigrant Song through the rollicking 3rd encore - Bring It On Home.  The acoustic set is particularly interesting and would become a staple in their 1975 and later shows. <br /> <br />Just pick it up and enjoy all the power and magic that was a Zeppelin concert!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />P.S.  Led Head - this was recorded live before Houses of The Holy was released and was still actually being finished in the studio which explains why No Quarter is not included here.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|When I watched the first episode of Firefly, I was not too excited about the tv series, but I continued to watch subsequent episodes for awhile, skipped the middle few episodes, and watched what turned out to be the last episode.  Then came \\"Serenity\\" movie, which I enjoyed and prompted me to buy the DVD set, which, now, I thoroughly enjoy.  I like some of the humor that is interspersed throughout each episode and the idea that Firefly seems to be a futuristic sci-fi western, sort of.  Now that I have watched the complete DVD set, I wish that the series was not cancelled. I would recommend Firefly to anyone who enjoys a different type of sci-fi series to the usual \\"let's kill all the aliens in our fancy shape/star ships\\" movies.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I WANT MORE~! Serenity was well worth the wait- I did manage to catch it in the theater and was blown away. Joss Whedon and the whole team did a fab job on bringing our band of misfits to the big screen in a big way. The humor, excitement, story and action combined with the evolution of the characters we know and love from the show WORKED. <br />The DVD is great- THANK YOU so much for the really good bonus footage. I love the outtakes and deleted scenes. I am not surprised  by the movie selling so well on DVD- am sure Universal will be pleased with the coincident sales of the Firefly series. Goal all along was for the show to become a film and then resume as a series. How about an a new series on SciFi? Firefly would make a great 4th hour of programming on Sci-Fridays! I know my TiVo would love it.......  <br /> <br />If you are thinking about buying here on Amazon vs at your local retailer- Amazon has the best price I have seen and it is flat out sold out everywhere I have been- in widescreen anyways. Full screen is readily available but what self respecting fan wants that?  <br /> <br />Best film in this verse this winter on DVD. ENJOY
B000B8QEZG|3.0|This was a much anticipated album that we all ran out to buy.  With all of the hype, maybe my expectations were set a bit high.  Critics were saying that it would be the ultimate dance album, a return to her original form, a better dance album than \\"You Can Dance.\\"      Well, I was expecting something that I could sing along to with lyrics that were fun and catchy.  \\"Hung Up\\" seems to be the only one that is catchy for me.  perhaps I need to hear it a few more times but I can remember the times when Madonna would release an album and I didn't HAVE to listen to it a few times to get used to it.      This is definitely better than \\"American Life\\" but it still is a trance-type album.  People talk about this being a Disco album but it's not.  It's trance with irreverent lyrics.  We're not always looking for deep lyrics but we're looking for songs that we can dance and sing to at a club or even the car, not something that is going to be background music at a noisy party where everyone is talking over the music anyway.     I hate to give negative reviews but I am giving this CD 3 stars because \\"Hung Up\\" is a good song to listen to.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First off, I don't watch tv.  Because of the constant garbage put out by cable and the networks, I have disconnected my home from cable and satelite.  Up until a few months ago I had never heard of Firefly - until I took my wife to see Serenity.  It was an instant hit with both of us.  As a result, I bought my wife the Firefly season for Christmas, and we sat down and watched every episode within a couple of days.  It is incredibly entertaining; every episode left us wanting for more.  We'd often tell each other that we need to go to bed, but we'd foolishly begin the next episode and get sucked back into the adventure for another hour, and another and another...   <br /> <br />I would like to offer one caveat particularly for parents, or for folks that are sensitive to the explicit sexuality.  I am usually fairly prudish when it comes to entertainment, so I am also a bit disappointed by the amount of sex that is injected into this show.  For example, one of the main characters on the ship is a high-class prostitute, and there are times when little is left to the imagination.  There are also many very explicit sex scenes with most of the characters that border on pornography in several of the episodes - including lesbian scenes.  This is definitely not a show for children.  In my opinion, this show would be even better if they took out the unnecessary explicitity. <br /> <br />But be that as it may, I still can not help myself.  The storylines, characters and the whole premise of this show just makes me want to plant myself on the couch (after the kids go to bed) for a couple of hours.  It's alot of fun.  If the execs don't bring this show back, then they're just confirming that they're as stupid as I've always thought.

Pi likes the animals and knows a lot about them, but Mr. Patel is careful and teaches his sons about the nature of the animals and to never assume they are anything, but wild.  Pi's life is good with loving parents, friends and an older brother who he adores.  He is a sweet child who loves God and all religions.  To the amazement of his parents, he becomes a Christian, a Muslim and Hindu all at the same time. Pi feels like each religion offers something wonderful in their beliefs. <br /> <br />When Mr. Patel decides to leave India, he sells most of his animals, but since he wants to start up another zoo, he books a cargo ship so that he can take some of his zoo stock with him.  The family of four head for their new life in Canada.  When they are barely into their voyage, a storm at sea causes the ship to sink.  Sixteen-year old Pi is unable to find his family and ends up on a large lifeboat carrying four other passengers.  His fellow shipmates are a zebra; a hyena, an orangutan and a very large Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. <br /> <br />The story of Pi's survival is imaginative, amazing, terrifying and unforgettable. <br />
B00000K0DK|5.0|I received this as a gift, too.  Having never seen it before, I naturally banished all hype and expectation.  I wanted to see the thing for itself.  And I was amazed and riveted.  The story penetrates to the heart of a great (or would-be great?) man.  I found it deeply moving and quite sad but also full of truth.  And the director (the famous Orson Welles who also stars) clearly put a great deal of thought and imagination into just about every scene.  Rarely have I seen a film of this quality, and I am looking forward to seeing it again. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|We watched Firefly and felll in love with the series. I brought my parents and friends to the movie; they all enjoyed it - my parents even went out and bought the series. I couldn't wait until the DVD came out. I now have it and have watched it several times. The movie stands well on its own (although you have to listen very carefully to the dialog to get what's going on if you did not watch the series) but it's even more fun if you watch Firefly first.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I am a logical, rational, intelligent human being.  However, being raised protestant, I have witnessed many of what I consider to be miracles that occurred in hospitals and cannot be explained by medical science. <br /> <br />Although this movie was very Hollywood, I still see in it a shred of realism in that the demonic forces which are abroad and unrelenting in their quest to unravel the already failing moral fiber of human beings.  My question for the writers is simple, in keeping with the statement made by the prosecution that the victim was an avid pupil of advanced catechism, why on Earth did this girl not cry out the name of Jesus Christ in her defense? <br /> <br />If she was such a learned individual in the area of multiple languages that for the layperson are just jibberish, then surely to God she must've known that Satan, nor his buddies, have no tolerance for the name of Christ, particularly when called upon by his \\"children\\". <br /> <br />So although I found the movie riveting beyond compare, even the Exorcist did not frighten me like this one, I also followed the inconsistencies in the story line.   <br /> <br />Any priest, regardless of how ignorant, is going to know as a student of the Word, of God and of man, that the body cannot go without nourishment.  That priest would not in good conscience have allowed her body to come to such a pass during his keeping.  It appears to me that she was in pretty bad shape before she even came into his care.  As the story goes, even when she was in school she \\"could not\\" eat, reports her boyfriend, and she was seeing a physician at that time.  Why then did not the physician see after her physical care?  Why was the physician not brought to trial for allowing her to come to such a pass?  Just the priest was held up before mankind as the villian - and with that I do not agree. <br /> <br />However, it does make for interesting viewing and enflames people of the Christian faith to ask such questions.   <br /> <br />The evil seemed to attack those who were most vulnerable to it.  The entity stalked only at night and only while one was alone in their bedroom.  I do not agree with the significance of 3 a.m. being the \\"sacred\\" time for demons, I think the buggers are everywhere at all times.  They do prey, as do all predators, on those weak enough to succumb.  It is their job and they do it well. <br /> <br />This coming from a woman of faith, I see this movie as both horrifying and gripping, but only entertaining in a National Geographic sort of way.  There is a lesson to be learned here.  I know part of it is fictional, but the parts that are not are what is scary.   <br /> <br />If you are not a person of faith, and you see nothing scary in the slightest with this movie, then my review will have no impact on you whatsoever.  If you are, however, someone who has seen and heard the miracles of God, then you have to know that the same sort of mystical events can occur when spurred on by Satan.  This child should have called on the name of her savior for protection and in my opinion she would have been delivered of her own demons, without the intervention of a priest or doctor. <br /> <br />If this type of thing is real, and I firmly believe with all my heart and soul it is, then we must all take precautions to bolster our faith wherever possible, and never be afraid to call out the name of Jesus Christ for deliverance when you are afraid for your immortal soul.
B0006399FS|4.0|Put this against most albums released this year and its great.  It's a very good pop rock album.  But I miss the experimental U2, its time to get back to the band that took chances.  They swtiched their style up every album and kept their audience guessing. <br /> <br />Now it's pop rock, radio friendly songs that are good but not great to me.  It's Bono ranting on about Africa every minute, I heard Larry Mullen times his speeches during concerts to see how long it lasts.  Come on, what they say in front of the camera is pumped up for the media.  You know those three can't stand how Bono rants on.  Ya, we all admire what you're doing, but stop plugging it into your music and concerts.  Like Adam Clayton, the coolest bass man around, wants to hear about Africa before \\"One\\" every show.  Give it a rest, Bono. <br /> <br />There are some strong songs here.  Mostly all of them are strong actually, except for a few fillers.  The production isn't great either, but if you're a u2 fan, you've come to expect that.  The people that mix their albums are horrible, from \\"Exit\\" on Joshua Tree to \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" on this record.  Where is Edge's guiitar? Say what you want, it's THE EDGE that makes u2 brilliant, more than Bono even.  Adam and him are getting better on every album, while Bono and Larry have been running through the motions.   <br /> <br />Highlights are \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Vertigo.\\" Pop songs that aren't creating anything new in rock but at the same time are still good, admit it. <br /> <br />Long rant.  Anyway, good album and maybe in the top 10 for 2005, but the boys need to change it up again.  Will always be a u2 fan, but make the next one another classic. <br />
1573223026|5.0|A LONG WAY DOWN by Nick Hornby is a touching and readable novel about four people who meet in an unlikely way and dislike, but understand, each other. It isn't the kind of book in which people learn to like those different from them, but rather the kind in which the reader gets to understand the characters in a manner that allows him or her to empathize with, if not like, the people it is about.<br /><br />This book is a relatively quick read, and it was hard to put down, as it begins with an interesting premise, and Hornby is really able to deliver on the promise of the novel. Martin, Maureen, Jess and JJ meet on New Year's Eve on the roof of \\"Toppers House\\" an apartment building that is popular in London for those who want to kill themselves by jumping off of it. They are all there for this purpose, but their meeting distracts them momentarily from their initiative to give up on life, and they become engaged in each other's problems, spending the night going about London on the behalf of one of them, and after this, they keep up their contact. The four elect this night to take the long way down from the roof, and their continued relationships follow the result of this decision. They decide they will give themselves more time regarding whether they should take the short way down on Valentine's Day, another popular suicidal holiday.<br /><br />The book is well told via the mechanism of switching perspectives among the four characters. It is not that Hornby retells incidents from each person's vantage point, but rather than the plot moves along and each person tells his or her bit of it. This allows us to understand each character as we understand ourselves, in a way, by seeing how he or she experiences the moments of the narrative and his or her past in the context of the book. It is a respectful way to treat the complexities of human nature and human relationships, and it isn't one bit trite or cliche. In fact, one of the characters takes pains to tell the reader, as she recounts her own family's tragedy, that this personal pain for her will not be resolved, as this isn't that kind of story.<br /><br />It is an insightful and loving story, though, and I highly recommend it. Hornby digs the complicated and messy aspects of human existance and draws them with respectful attention to their chaotic realties. This book is a pleasurable and an enriching read!ader, as she recounts her own family's tragedy, that this personal pain for her will not be resolved, as this isn't that kind of story.  <br />  <br />It is an insightful and loving story, though, and I highly recommend it.

0679722610|4.0|Aeschylus.  The harvest of death is both plentiful and bloody in Dashiell Hammett's marvelous thriller \\"Red Harvest\\".    Dashiell Hammett, a former Pinkerton detective, pretty much invented the hard-boiled (U.S.) detective genre.  The influence of Hammett's short stories and novels, \\"Red Harvest\\", \\"The Dain Curse\\", \\"The Glass Key\\", \\"The Thin Man\\" and \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" can be seen in much of the detective fiction writing that followed, including among others Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, Jim Thompson, Ross Macdonald, James Ellroy, Robert Parker, James Lee Burke, and Michael Connelly.  The plot of \\"Red Harvest\\", Hammett's first novel, also found its way into movies such as Akira Kurosawa's \\"Yojimbo\\", Sergio Leone's \\"For a Fistful of Dollars\\", and the Coen brother's \\"Miller's Crossing\\".      \\"Red Harvest\\" begins with the arrival of the Continental Op, Hammett's trademark \\"man with no name\\" in the town of Personville.  The client he has been summoned to see is found murdered before the Op can meet him.  In short order the Op finds that Personville's nickname, \\"Poisonville\\" is well-earned.  It is a town filled with small town greed and big time corruption.  The Ops arrival coincides with the onset of a turf war for control of the city between rival gangsters.  The Op pays a call on the dead man's father, Elihu Willsson. The Op soon determines that the town's descent into a state approaching a low level of hell began when Willsson imported some mobsters to break up a strike.  Their stay turned out to be far from a temporary one.    For reasons of his own, perhaps just to be stubborn or perhaps as a matter of some principle or warrior code, the Op decides to stay and clean up the town.  His method is simple, pit each gang and its various factions and sub-factions against each other until the dust settles and it is discovered that they have pretty much killed themselves off.  The Op is not afraid to pitch in and help the process along.    As noted above, \\"Red Harvest\\" was Hammett's first full length book.  Perhaps as a result some of the sentences were longer and more `literary' than his later books, by which time he had perfected a leaner, staccato, machine gun style of dialogue.  Nevertheless, \\"Red Harvest\\" was and remains an impressive and exciting piece of writing.     \\"Red Harvest\\" along with just about everything else Hammett ever wrote is well worth reading.

B0002OERI0|5.0|When I first heard  the single \\"American Idiot\\", I thought to myself that this is classic Green Day.  I liked it, but the chorus was very similar to what Green Day had done so many times before (and had done it well).  I did not know what I was in for. <br /> <br />The CD is brilliant!  The second track \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is a 5 song masterpiece.  I love the guitars in JOS.  Simple but effective. <br /> <br />\\"Holiday\\" is a tremendous song, with great riffs and infectious chorus.  You may be tired of hearing it now since its been played on the airwaves so much, but this will still be sounding good in the next decade. <br /> <br />Whatsername, Give Me Novacaine, Wake Me Up When September Ends, Letterbomb are all quality songs that are kind of Beatlesque sounding. <br /> <br />This has been by far my most listened to CD in many years.  Not a stinker on the album.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Cosmic.  That is the word I would use if I had to sum this album up in only one word, but it's so much more than that.  Thom Yorkes voice is dramatic and emotional, and the songs here are lyrically genius.  This album will leave you breathless and you very well might listen to it over and over again whenever you put it in your CD Player.  It's become the background music to my life at points.  Try listening to 'Let Down' or 'No Surprises' while driving your car through the night and prepare to be moved to tears.  'Paranoid Android' is a chaotic ballad that expresses perfectly how F**ked up the world is.  All of the songs here are absolutely amazing.  I've owned OK Computer for quite some time now, and it is by far the best album I have ever heard.  I was utterly shocked to see that this album doesn't have 5 stars.  After reading some reviews I have to say... You have to have no ear for good music to give this album such a low rating.
B00007K02F|4.0|This is a film that I continue to go back to over & over. The last time I watched it, I had just finished reading Charlotte Bronte's book (again).  The movie is faithful to the *spirit* of the book - it captures the essence of Jane's upbringing, her stoicism, & the troubled romance with Mr. Rochester.<br /><br />Why do I like it?<br /><br />* It's a good adaptation of the book.  (For Bronte fans, I stress the word adaptation.) It doesn't get bogged down representing all the details of the book (for example, St John Rivers is a minor character in the film), but does capture the spirit and the essence of the book.<br /><br />* It's got a great cast. Charlotte Gainsbourg is a \\"dead ringer\\" for Jane Eyre/Charlotte Bronte - if you're a fan of the book, this is the person who is in your imagination. Geraldline Chaplin, Amanda Root, Anna Paquin (the young Jane Eyre), William Hurt and Joan Plowright are perfectly cast. Even Elle MacPherson is ably cast.<br /><br />* Zeffirelli's films are a visual treat - the landscape, the costumes, the scene setting. My favorite scene is when they morph the story from young Jane to grown Jane. Another favorite is when William Hurt first sees her and falls from his horse. The sweeping shots of the countryside are breathtaking.<br /><br />* The music (I think it's original) is wonderful too!<br /><br />Why would anyone else like it?<br /><br />* My husband & I just watched it with my mother-in-law over the holidays. My mother-in-law is a huge devotee of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, and the older film versions (think Greer Garson) of their books. Despite her preference for older films, she couldn't find fault with the film (I consider this a huge victory). Even my husband liked it and he is neither a devotee of older films or classic romantic English novels. He hasn't read Jane Eyre.<br /><br />* The DVD has extra features that are interesting, e.g., interviews with Joan Plowright (who grew up near the Brontes' parsonage) and with Franco Zeffirelli which provide additional background on Jane Eyre and the film.sonage) and with Franco Zeffirelli which provide additional background on Jane Eyre and the film.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|This  is a great CD. It really showcases John Mayers amazing talent, in my opinion he is one of the best guitar players ever. And yes, dispite what the other \\"hater\\" reviewers said, John can really sing. Warning to some, this is a Blues cd, this is a completley different type of cd than \\"Room for sqaures\\". This may turn off some fans, but dont worry, John's new solo CD \\"Continuium\\" is due out in Spring 06.
0783232039|4.0|After being stuck in an evidence locker for 2 years, Chucky is freed by corrupt cop Bailey, sent by his girlfriend Tiffany. Officer Bailey is quickly offed and Chucky is taken home. He's in quite a state, but then so would you be if you were diced in a giant fan. Using bits off her massive doll collection Tiffany manages to bring Chucky back to life using another chant to the mighty Damballa.<br /><br />As soon as he's on his feet Chucky does yet another killing to get the circulation going. Tiffany is excited and can't wait to get Chucky into a human body so they can get hitched. But Chuck is dead against marriage and laughs in her face. Dejected, Tiffany locks him in a play pen while she blows off some steam. Not taking kindly to being locked up, Chucky breaks out and kills her by knocking a TV into her bathtub.<br /><br />Another chant to Damballa brings her back in the form of one of her many dolls. Angry with the loss of her nice, fleshy body and being stuck in a short, plastic one, Tiffany starts researching ways to help herself without Chucky's aid. Tough luck, the only way out is with the help of an amulet that was buried with Chucky's human body years ago.<br /><br />Conning a couple of local lovebirds, hick Jesse and well-to-do Jade, into driving them to the graveyard in New Jersey, Chuck and Tiff begin a cross-country killing spree, leaving a pile of dead bodies in their wake that the cops assume are the work of Jesse and Jade. Marital disputes between couples both flesh and plastic follow. Don't laugh, it's good! The formula of Child's Play was wearing mighty thin by the end of the 3rd film and really needed a fresh new spin to keep it alive. Don Mancini struck the nail right on the head when he turned it into a post-modern horror. Remember, this was back in the days when post-modern horror was all the rage so it might seem just the tiniest bit dated now. But compared to the endless Urban Legend, Scream and I Know yadda yadda films Bride of Chucky seems to have the sharpest wit, the slickest direction and strongest production values.<br /><br />Director Ronny Yu gives us plenty of eye-candy and shoots the film with loads of darkness and deep blacks. A horror series like this needs technical superiority and imagination when it comes to direction and Ronny Yu soars over Jack Bender's mundane approach to Child's Play 3.<br /><br />Composer Graeme Revell returns and delivers a more sophisticated, if slightly generic, score to those awful death-metal guitar/synthesizer cues to Child's Play 3. His main theme from Child's Play 2 comes and goes briefly and he forgets the huge orchestral mayhem he did before. But he does introduce a very cool Twin Peaks-style love theme for Chuck and Tiff. An alright score overall that really should get a release on CD.<br /><br />Katherine Heigl is very easy on the eye as is Jennifer Tilly (as a human). Plus it also features one of my favorite actors, the Late John Ritter, who died in 2003. Margot Kidder's gorgeous niece Janet also has a small role and Kathy Najimy (that's Peggy Hill for you King of the Hill fans) cameos as a distressed Motel Maid.<br /><br />Shot on Kodak Vision Premier, the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks stunning and has an equally good Dolby 5.1 sound design. The DVD is loaded with extras.seems to have the sharpest wit, the slickest direction and strongest production values. <br /> <br />Director Ronny Yu gives us plenty of eye-candy and shoots the film with loads of darkness and deep blacks.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|This was a great film.  Excellent science fiction.  The trailers do not seem to reflect the movie at all.  It is much more creative and much more a think piece than the trailer would indicate.  I too would love to have more.
B000031WYP|3.0|I am not a sophisitcated opera afficiando. My love of opera is limited mostly to the operas I recall my father listening to on Sunday afternoons, Madame Butterfly, Aida, Tosca, and Cavalleria Rusticana. Cavalleria is my favorite, but unfortunately, this recording is not.<br /><br />The volume extremes make it essentially impossible to listen to and enjoy. Listening in my car, if the volume is loud enough to hear the softer portions, then when the louder portions arrive, I'm nearly scared into having an accident. I think my point is important to consider because nowadays about the only place you can listen to opera is in a car.<br /><br />I'm online now to buy a different recording.
B000000H66|4.0|Many people fight over the first death metal band whether it was Possessed or DEATH. Does'nt really matter they both kick some death metal ass right? Symbolic was probably the best release from the innovaters. I guarrantee this to anyone who has a taste for slayers riffs
B000B86S1Q|5.0|I passed over this book a couple of times before buying it.  Was I glad I did.  I laughed and cried as I read about Holly and Gerry and their family and friends.  It's a touching story and a great read.
B000BZIT5M|2.0|To give my background with this production, I first saw this on VHS several years ago and bootleg copied the VHS for my own personal viewing.  It was this lovely production with its wonderful performance by Ileana Cotrubas and Neil Shicoff which led me to really get into opera.  I remember being chilled to the bone when I first heard Che gelida manina and Si, mi chiamano mimi...  So I was terribly excited to see that they FINALLY released this on DVD in the US.  Well I listened to this as soon as I got and was noticed that they did their digital magic and cleaned up this over 30 year old video quite well.  The colors and sharpness are as good as they can be, however, I was terribly disappointed with the sound.  I'm not sure how this can be because of all the technology at their disposal.  The voices sounded like they were in some large hall, and the balance with the orchestra was completely off.  I know that Shicoff doesn't have the most commanding voice, but you could clearly hear him on the old VHS version.  When both Shicoff and Cotrubas are being drowned out by the orchestra you have to wonder what went wrong.  It isn't always noticeable, but severely diminished my enjoyment of my favorite parts, that being the arias in the first act between Rodolfo and Mimi.  So, don't buy this DVD.  What a terrible disappointment and waste of money.  The most important part of a transfer of the opera HAS to be the sound!
B000002JSP|5.0|This album isn't as bad as some of the other Amazon reviewers have said. One of them that I just read said that this was synth-laden, which I don't mind if the songs are strong. The song &quot;Carouselambra&quot; has heavy synthesizers, but is actually one of the greatest tunes they ever recorded, so just shut up about that gripe. The only songs that you could maybe say are filler is &quot;I'm gonna crawl&quot;, and &quot;Hot Dog&quot;, and even those aren't really that bad. I heard one reviewer saying that he thought &quot;All My Love&quot; was total swill, which is baffling to me, because that song is one of their most beautiful and endearing song's that they ever did. I think that one was about Robert Plant's dealing with the death of his beloved son, who's name escapes me at the moment. I am getting a little tired of the song &quot;Fool In The Rain&quot;, which I really liked when it was first on the radio. I think that Plant and Jones were the only members of the band that were dedicated to working on this album, because of the substance abuse of Page and Bonham. This is the album where John Paul Jones really shines. He never got much credit for being a great musician, but he definitely is great. Try out IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR, I'm sure you will like at least 4 or 5 tracks, and don't worry about the synths, they really work on this album. ENJOY!!!
068987474X|4.0|This is a good book. It's funny and it gets the point across: if a guy digs you, he'll let you know. Otherwise, move on. You shouldn't have to stand on your head to get a guy to like you. Like many other readers, I wish I had found this book sooner. Still, I felt this book somehow abdicated men of the responsibility to act like men. According to the authors, men will make known their lack of interest in various ways, but very seldom by saying outright: \\"I'm just not that into you.\\" More often than not, it's through more subtle measures. So it's up to women to decode this behavior of men & then move on. How about a book for men called \\"You're just not that into her so be a man and say it\\"? So to sum up, this is a funny read but it still places the burden on the woman.
B00000DOYR|5.0|This is by far the best album that AC/DC ever put out. I'll say as far as the music part is concerned, but really it's lyrics are pretty filthy in my estimation. As a dumb kid with hormones raging, I thought the lyrics were cool, but now at the age of 41, they're kind of chauvinistic and embarrassing, so I took off 1/4 a star on my rating. As far as flat out rocking, this is one of the best hard rock albums in rock's history. I've heard as much as I want to hear of the song &#34;You shook me all night long&#34;, because they play it incessantly on my local radio stations. The two that I like the most are the tracks &#34;Shake a Leg&#34;, and &#34;Shoot To Thrill&#34; because they aren't played quite as much on the radio. I had a friend that thought that FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK was far superior to this one, but that's a totally stupid statement, because BACK IN BLACK'S songs are just far stronger than that release. If you're a strong Christian, I would caution you against buying this, because this album has pretty dirty lyrics, but if you just like albums that flat out rock, then this is for you. ENJOY!!!
B0002X314C|5.0|Yeah, this is a great cd. By the way its not an explicit cd. My favorite songs are \\"Number One\\" and \\"Used to Love U.\\" But that one person was right: John Legend does have VERY good potential of being a Stevie Wonder or another good pianst. But this is a good cd and I recommend it. I hope he keeps selling cds, cause at this rate, he has good potential.
B000002J09|5.0|There aren't to many Zeppelin albums that I think every track is super strong, but this one is about the only won that does. It's still not my favorite Zeppelin album even so. Hey dumbass reviewer BonzoZeppelin who wrote all those short bad reviews on December 26th, you're a big dumbass loser retard with an IQ of 35 who doesn't know how to do anything but bash the mighty Led Zeppelin. Go to music school, and maybe you'll learn a thing or two about who's good and who's not good in the game of Rock & Roll. Enough of my tirade!!! This is solid throughout, but I am sick of \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", and \\"Rock & Roll\\". If you had never heard those three songs, I would tell you you're in for a real treat before you heard this masterpiece, but I'm sure everybodys heard them billions of times. This is one of their albums that they didn't rip off a lot of the blues artists like Robert Johnson, and I'm forgetting the names of all of them. The album that preceded this one LED ZEPPELIN III was far worse that IV, so this one got them out of their slide. This is still thought of by many as the finest rock album of all time, and while I couldn't go that far myself, it's still a great listen though. ENJOY!!!<br /><br />P.S. What's the deal you voters on reviews? I give a five star review and because I have a few gripes about it (like I'm tired of a couple of the tracks that are played too much) you get your panties in a bunch, and you can't handle that someone had a little gripe about your mighty Zeppelin. I think they're mighty too, but stop being damn fanatics. I'm just being honest about my feelings about the material on the album. You fanatics are so sensitive. Why don't you go cry to your mommies! I'm out for good now!!!
B00004YZ36|5.0|Geza Anda possesed an unique and enviable (in the best sense of the word)rapport with Mozart. There are versions that must be underlined among the most pyramidal ever done. His First, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, 12th,the 15th, the 19th,23th and 27th justify by far its acquisition.<br /><br />Geza Anda received an invaluable influence of thwo superb musicians; the unforgettable Clara Haskil and the hyper talented Hungarian conductor, Ferenc Fricsay.<br /><br />Playing and conducting from the Piano he played regularly in Salzburg Festivals, being his sound pristine and crystalline. His excellent approach and above all, his formidable pianism, conform one of the most indispensable sets of these Piano Concertos.<br /><br />Specially recomended in this special year 2006 in which all of us will commemorate the 250th anniversary of this sublime composer.
B000006TRV|5.0|This album should really top the album DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, as far as sales go, but it definitely tops that one musically, at least to me. This is Roger Waters masterpiece, and really shows his complete genius as a lyricist. These songs were the soundtrack of the end of my Junior High and beginning of my High schools years. This is either 1st or 2nd as far as concept albums go, and one of the best rock albums ever made. I'll have to cut this review short for now, but I will return to give a longer review.
0307276902|4.0|It was an interesting story but I had to force myself to finish this book. Two pages devoted to a description of watching coffee brew.....please!!! I found the writing bland and monotonous. It's a good story but I personally don't think much of Frey as a writer.
B000B8QF00|5.0|an amazing collection!
B000002H33|5.0|this was the second metallica cd i ever bought and it is amazing. the riffs the solos and the lyrics are sure to please everyone, it is catchy and has no filler songs, all of them could be hit singles easily.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Hypnotize finally lays rest the question of the bands direction. This album shows the band's newly found maturity. The vocals from Daron, even though extremely nasal, create a great harmony with Serj's deeper more controlled voice. \\"Attack\\" is a great opener to this CD,, it grabs the listeners attention. \\"Dreaming\\" is another great song, with great meaning behind the lyrics. \\"Kill Rock n' Roll\\" is a crazy song that SOAD is so great at making. \\"Hypnotize\\" is okay, but overplayed, Daron's vocals ruin it. This song has way too many half notes =P. \\"Holy Mountains\\" is by far the band's best composition. THis song encompasses their musicality, lyrically ability (when they actually try), and their amazing ability to still have an edgy song with deep meaning. \\"Stealing Society\\" is a very catchy song, with lyrics that will 'hypnotize' you. \\"Tentative\\" and \\"u-Fig\\" are both excellent compositions. \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" nearly made me cry I laughed so hard. Classical crazy SOAD. \\"She's Like Heroin\\" is so eerie and creepy it has scared me inot never trying any sort of drug. \\"Lonely Day\\" is a big disappointment and is by far the worst song on the album. Its catchy but the lyricals sound like they were written by a nine-year-old. \\"Soldier Side\\" is the perfect ending to this album. It is also one of their greatest compositons and finishes the album start to finish. It brings to mind the true horror war can bring. SOAD continues their conquest to establish musical individuality and is doing great. Their diverse sound is attractive to those looking from a relief from the over-popular emo trash that MTV loves nowadays. This CD is even better when listend to after listening to Mezmerize. All these songs get a 11/10 except for \\"Lonely Day\\", which gets a 5/10 becasue of Daron and horrible lyrics. I juts hope SOAD stays around and keeps Serj. I still get the feeling Daron will try and take over...... A definete must-buy. SOAD's greatest work yet. I cant say enough about this album. Givea good 4-5 listen-throughs before commenting on it.
B000002H97|4.0|Many people say Metallica lost their touch with album but i say they just reinvented it. Yeh sure, it may not please everyone but it worked out for the better because this is an amazing cd. i love every song, although not my favorite metallica cd its top 3 easy.
B0000026J1|3.0|Europe were a hair band from the 80s known almost only because of the Final Countdown and their extreme use of keyboards. This album has alot of keyboards and more slow power ballady songs than straight up rockers like the Final Countdown, but it is good none the less. Each song is good with a sing along chorus. Joey Tempest's voice on this album is excellent. Fans of \\"The Final Countdown Era\\" of Europe will most likely enjoy this. People who like a little more metal and a little less keyboards should check out Europe's first two albums for a more metal sound.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theaters and new then i was going to buy it. I bought this uncut version with special features and it does not dissapiont. It shows how saw came to be and how it was made and a look into the movie you wouldn't get with just watching it, it makes you appreciate the movie more. i recommend to all old enough to enjoy this!
B00005JGAB|3.0|This albums is a very good example of simplistic and repetitious lyrics, and the bludgeoning of the same three guitar chords. But why did this album get three stars? This album, while simple and stupid, plain and simply rocks. This album is filled with don't-give-a-damn rockers. If you want an album you can just rock out to and not pick apart all of the negative aspects of, I recommend this album for you. Stear clear if you accept nothing short of John Lennon lyrics.
B000020617|5.0|When i bought this cd i was expecting learn to fly to be the best song and the rest to be just filler to make a full album. was i ever wrong. this is now one of my favorite cds and the best foo fighters cd to date, it is full of catchy riffs and songs that are sure to please everyone!
B0000026T4|4.0|This album was Alice Cooper's comeback, and boy did he comeback in a big way. This album is fully of hard rocking 80s hairiness. Songs like Poison and House of Fire will make him new fans and bring back many who had just about given up on Alice. Alice has always been good at reinventing himself and changing with the times, and this album is proof. How come, if I love this album so much, why did I give it only four stars. The song \\"Only My Heart Talkin'\\" makes me sick to my stomach. Buy this album if your an Alice fan or a hair metal fan, but avoid \\"Only My Heart Talkin'\\"
B00003CXDG|4.0|\\"MI2\\" is a rarity among sequels--it's actually comparable to the first film in terms of action with better action sequences than Brian DePalma's strong first entry in this franchise. Based on the 1966 TV show (which also spawned another TV show that failed to find an audience), \\"MI2\\" works because of John Woo's carefully choregraphed action sequences and the action packed script by Robert Towne (writer of\\"Chinatown\\", \\"Shampoo\\" -and also the awful \\"Days of Thunder\\")based on a story by Ron Moore & Brannon Braga who wrote \\"Star Trek: First Contact\\"). While the character development could be stronger, the story is fairly weak but what makes this film work is the action sequences although it seems they are trying to make Hunt into more of a Bond character.<br /><br />Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise before his public relations meltdown)must stop the bioengineered virus Chimera from being used to create a worldwide epidemic. It seems that a former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott)has intercepted the cure and is holding it for ransom. Hunt must assemble an IMF team quickly which icludes Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Billy Baird (John Polson) and a civilian Nyah (Thandie Newton)who was previously involved with Ambrose. Hunt is working with a deadline because the virus kills rapidly and he must prevent Ambrose and his henchmen from working out a deal with Biotech CEO John McCloy (Brendan Gleeson).<br /><br />The transfer from Paramount looks pretty good although it doesn't appear as sharp looking as more recent releases (it came out in 2000 on DVD). If you purchased the single disc set stick with it; the second disc in the two disc set is a waste of money.<br /><br />The first disc comes with some nice extras including a 15 minute featurette, a 30 minute section on the stunts that includes interviews with director John Woo and the stunt crew. This can be viewed as separate featurettes on each stunt and includes storyboards. Metallica's music video \\"I Disappear\\" also appears as well as an alternate opening sequence, the MTV Movie Awards parody \\"Mission Improbable\\" and interviews with Woo, Cruise and stunt coordinator Brian Smrz. Woo also provides a commentary track for the film.ing sequence, the MTV Movie Awards parody \\"Mission Improbable\\" and interviews with Woo, Cruise and stunt coordinator Brian Smrz.

B000BCKFWK|5.0|Sin City is a series of graphic novels created by Frank Miller and brought to the screen by director Robert Rodriguez. The film focuses on 3 graphic novels in the series: The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard and The Big Fat Kill. The best one being The Hard Goodbye, which is about a big guy named Marv who searches for the guy who set him up for murdering a hooker named Goldie. Now, aside from all the great actors, Rosario Dawson, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis and so on, and aside from the great cinematography (shot entirely on green screen), this 2 disc recut and extended dvd has it all. On one disc you have the original theatrical cut with 2 different commentaries plus loads of really cool extras like how Rodriguez conviced Frank Miller to make the film. And then on the second disc you have the film seperated into 4 different stories with over 20 added minutes plus a lot more special features such as the all green screen high speed version of the film. And even aside from that you get the first graphic novel in the series also. I would deffinately recommend this dvd even if you already own the original dvd. Becuase of all the extras and the being able to view the movie into four different stories this dvd is worth all the money. If you don't already own it buy it, and if you do already own the original dvd buy it. This dvd is hands down the best dvd of 2005.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|The detailed reviews already written need no further embellishment from me. Let me just add that, from this period of KC's existence, this record and \\"Lark's Tongues in Aspic\\" are the two classic, must-have releases. Okay now stop reading and buy this disc.
6305342776|3.0|The Black Hole, Disney's attempt to capitalize on the Star Wars phenomena, is full of cliches: cute robots, evil scientists, and square-jawed heroes.  <br /> <br />The film's saving grace is the premise; solving the mysteries behind a very interesting steller phenomenon - a black hole. I also like the movie's very non-Disney, surrealistic ending (shades of 2001). <br /> <br />Sci-Fi fans will find something to like about Black Hole, but look into getting a re-mastered, letterbox version of this film. The Black Hole is no \\"Blade Runner\\", but it is pretty good.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I truly love Enya and never thought I would say this either, but this sounds like the same stuff I heard in A Day Without Rain. Kind of boring, and you dont listen to over and over like her other albulms. I listened to this album once and did not touch it until about a week or 2 later. The album is not really bad, it is just using the same ol, same ol.I have always been a fan of Enya and will continue to be, but she has to tighten up a little bit. I was kind of cross when I got this album for the first time, but not really suprised. Some of theses songs sound like they were just thrown together just to be on the album. I have waited along with you guys for this album and I know Enya can do better than this. Hopefully the next album will be better than this one.
B00005JOHI|1.0|Stunning photography and highly imaginative scripting and casting: Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennet) is especially striking in his clear familial and sartorial resemblance to great-great-grandson Buddy Ebson (Jed Clampett), before the family left England (possibly due to some unspeakable behavior involving pigs) and moved to the New World where they acquired more polish and class, rising in American society to the beautiful mountains of Kentucky.   <br /> <br />The director has wisely smoothed out Austen's complex characters and overly involved plot to a level more suitable to modern sensibilities and tastes; for moderns challenged by the complexities of \\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\" or Harlequin novels, this tender tale provides all the depth, subtlety, and brilliant crafting of a Barbara Cartland Romance.  <br /> <br />Stars are subtracted from this otherwise lovely film as an issue of Truth In Labeling, with potential confusion to the consumer. It is common for artists producing a work \\"Based On\\" a classic work (but bearing little resemblance to the original) to give their work a fitting alternate name. For example, a stirring tale \\"based on\\" \\"Homer's Oddysey\\" might become \\"O, Brother Where Art Thou\\" or it might become \\"Cold Mountain.\\" The novel \\"based on Jane Austin's \\"Emma\\" has become \\"Clueless\\" and her \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has become \\"Bridget Jones' Diary.\\" This production continues as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" suggesting that credit belongs to Austin. Very gracious and modest of them, after putting so much of their own creativity (and so little of hers) into the movie, but really, they shouldn't have.   <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't watch television because it is generally mindless.  I saw this through renting and then buying the firefly series on a blind buy. What I don't understand is how something this good got made in the first place. I can see how Fox missed the boat and now must be kicking themselves.  With the sets built, characters established  and a serious fan base in place why would they not bring it back.  What a media story that would be.  It's gotta be better and more stable than their newest fare.
B000AA305M|1.0|The music is great. NO question about that. Enough said. However the copy protection will not allow transfer to an IPOD device. Maybe SONY doesn't yet realize that IPODs ( and simliar devices ) are not only the future but also the present. How many people do you see carrying a portable CD player anymore. All this protection software has done is anger a whole lot of people who can listen to a thousand other artists. I enjoy David Grays music very much but will not purchase anymore music CDs which contain software that prevents me from transfering music to an IPOD. Sony's website ( or SUNNCOMM's site ) blame APPLE for this. Who do they think they are kidding.
B000002ULO|4.0|When Flaming Pie arrived in 1997, the critics were hailing it as a major return to form.  I'm not quite sure where this downward spiral talk began---I mean, sure, Pipes of Peace way back in 1983 was sub-par, and 1993's Off The Ground was not earth shattering---but come on, the man was trying instead of just sitting back and going on nostalgia tours as the 'ex-Beatle.'   1989's Flowers In The Dirt was excellent, afterall.  For what it's worth, Flaming Pie does seem to find a newly focused and adamant McCartney, perhaps creating an album that is more intimate than previous efforts, and confronting some personal issues in his lyrics like never before.    On Flaming Pie, Paul is clearly influenced by then recent work on the huge Beatles ANTHOLOGY project, and the leadoff track, \\"The Song We Were Singing,\\" is clearly Paul reminiscing about his days with John, George and Ringo and is one of the best songs on the album.  The album's title track is a great little spoof on the old story McCartney relays in the liner notes: \\"John joked that the name Beatles came in a vision from a man on a flaming pie, coming unto us...you are Beatles with an A.\\"   Even the album's first single, \\"The World Tonight,\\" a minor hit in 1997, finds McCartney in full Beatles mode: \\"The lyrics were just gathering thoughts. Like 'I go back so far, I'm in front of me' - I don't know where that came from, but if I'd been writing with John he would have gone 'OK, leave that one in; we don't know what it means but we do know what it means'.\\"    The rest of Flaming Pie is clearly influenced by his love for Linda, who at this time was in the middle of a very hard fought battle with cancer which eventually took her life in 1998, a year after Flaming Pie's release.  \\"Somedays\\" is one of McCartney's finest late-period ballads and is haunting to listen to today with Linda having passed.  \\"Calico Skies\\" combines themes of Paul's love for Linda with some political commentary, but is far from preachy, and thus again, it's one of his finest late-period pieces.  \\"Heaven on a Sunday\\" features Linda on harmonies, and in a change from previous works and perhaps due to illness, is one of the few songs to do so on this album.  It also includes a great electric/acoustic guitar exchange between Paul and his young son, James.  This song (to my knowledge) is eerily Linda's last appearance on any of Paul's recorded work.  \\"Young Boy\\" and \\"Great Day\\" both continue the traditional ode to family found on McCartney records, and are both heartfelt and enjoyable songs.      The collaborations on this record are Flaming Pie's weakest spots, and would have been better served as B-sides or cut from the album completely.  Paul's encounters with Steve Miller on \\"Used to Be Bad\\" and \\"If You Wanna\\" are dull and boring, and even Ringo Starr's drumming can't save \\"Really Love You.\\"  These collaborative efforts slow down the otherwise rich album, and detract from a song like \\"Souvenir,\\" which finds Paul in full experimental mode once again.     The album does close strongly, with the meditative \\"Little Willow\\" (written for Ringo's ex-wife Maureen, who had died recently after a long illness) and \\"Beautiful Night,\\" a rousing song with Ringo on drums and both Linda and Ringo on harmonies, and orchestrated by ex-Beatles producer George Martin.       Flaming Pie is an album rich in history.  His reconnection with The Beatles through the ANTHOLOGY project clearly reinvigorated him, but the album does have a mournful tone as well due to Linda's illness.  Much like his solo debut album, 1970's McCartney, Paul is playing most of the instruments here (with help from producer Jeff Lynne).  Anytime Paul records this way, the results are usually highly impressive (like on his new 2005 album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard).      Four stars only because the collaborations are unneeded here, but overall Flaming Pie is a thoroughly enjoyable listen and one of McCartney's classics.  If I may quote a previous reviewer here at Amazon, \\"jgarratt,\\" who so truthfully writes: \\"In an age where songs are designed to be money makers, here is an old veteran who does it because it's in his blood.\\"  So true...and well said.    Released in 1997 and reaching #2 on the US charts.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I first saw this film on 1st February 2004 I was lucky enough to go with my Mum to see a sneek preview of 'Big Fish'. The movie opened in cinemas in Australia officially on February 5th 2004.<br /><br />I read the 'Big Fish' book during January and enojoyed it. I thought Tim could find some fancy elements that seem to have become his trademarks. I was right. He has created a brilliant picture for Ewan. From reports Ewan is very proud of this film. I would be too if I were him. Tim Burton's movies to me, seem so dark and unusual. I've seen most of his films and for most of the time, that would be a fair assessment of them. But I can't say this for 'Big Fish'. 'Big Fish' seems truely magical, lovely and nice. As if it came straight out of a book of fairy tales, and each page were sprinkled with fairy dust that warms everyone's heart.<br /><br />The script was excellently written. So many wonderful, very beautiful lines. The photography was so clear and sharp, one can watch the story unfold with ease. It is hard to take your eyes off the screen, the results are just so scrumptious, you shouldn't reach the end of the film and not feel fulfilled and enlightened. This movie followed the book closely. Only filling the story in where it felt it needed to. I don't remember a car submerged in water, or even a car drying out in the branches of a tree, but the naked woman (mermaid) Ewan McGregor's character Edward Bloom sees in the water, I remember vividly. I'm glad the nudity didn't detract from the movie. It's all in the book briefly, as it is in the film. In these underwater scenes I couldn't help but think of 'Splash'. Although the woman in this still seemed to have human legs not a mermaid's tail like is usually the case with mermaids.<br /><br />I also liked Allison Lohman's role in this film even though it was somewhat brief it was effective. She was the quintessential beauty of Edward's life. I knew from the previews to this movie I would love it, but one of those reasons was her. Some character's just stand out sometimes and she did. A very well cast film, filled with brilliant performances to bring a world to life. Ewan goes about his role with sheer ease and style. He is a natural. A genius at expressing his emotions. He makes it look so easy. At first I thought it didn't seem to be a terribly physical role for Ewan, but he soon changed that. Ewan is brave! I write that like I'm surprised. I shouldn't be. Ewan can do anything. Everybody loves Edward Bloom (like the flower).<br /><br />Whereever Edward turns his hand to, everything opens to full bloom in a warm glow of radiant sunshine. He makes anything seem possible, no matter how hard it may seem at first. Then just when you think 'Big Fish' is a simple little story, it has underlying depth to it, amid the humor. It brances out in exraordinary ways.<br /><br />Two of my favorite scenes were in the field of daffodils (not a 'Field Of Dreams'), with Allison. I don't think I've heard many other lines more beautiful then those of Ewan to Jessica. It was an extraordinary moment. I wonder how many other people propose to the ones they love, without knowing much about them. Instead just relying on a feeling and the rest of their lives to discover someone, who makes their heart's sour with inexplicable delight. But then I think babies are created with just as much out of a feeling of love, not knowing how things will really turn out eventually, but somehow it does. Must be the same with marriage. That's very special.<br /><br />A worthwhile movie experience. In keeping with the book that Daniel Wallance dedicated to his own father, but made even better. My love for this movie keeps growing. I hope to see this movie again. If only to wrap my thoughts around all the characters.<br /><br />I really wanted to see this movie because I heard my special Ewan friend Gabrielle had a chance to be in it. Unfortunately she was overlooked. The producers will be sorry. I know she would have fitted in well, If I was making a movie, I'd take her in a second. Honestly I would. There were plenty of opportunity for crowd scenes, so for every Ewan fan able to be involved in the shoot, consider yourself very lucky. Your time shall come Gabrielle! You will show them and they will be sorry they didn't pick you. Lilia, one of the special girls able to meet and have a photo with Ewan McGregor, was one lucky girl! I hope she enjoyed the movie too! I'm so glad I got to chat and congratulate Lilia on her special time with Ewan. 'Big Fish' is sure to remain a favorite for many more people then usual because some got opportunities one doesn't usually get. Well done everyone with a special Ewan or 'Big Fish' story. You all make 'Big Fish' bigger and better then ever. I read the book to see what Gabrielle was missing out on. I also get the CD to complete my movie experience. I shall hold this Ewan movie esspecially close to my heart because I loved it, but also for Gabrielle's sake too. Keep trying something will bite soon, and it will be better then a 'Big Fish'. But until that time, it will be special to me because of Gabrielle.know she would have fitted in well, If I was making a movie, I'd take her in a second. Honestly I would.

0156027321|2.0|With all of the hype around this book, I had high expectations which were not met.  It was a relatively slow read, which picked up here and there.  It had some interesting parts, and kind of a cool ending/twist.  However, I expected it to be more inspiring and more reflective and more compelling to read.

B000BJS4SU|1.0|His 'Stupid Mouth' is the most appropriate song he will ever write. He really sounds like he has a towel stuck in his mouth. His voice is horrid. His phrasing is off. He's a good guitarist, but there are so many that are better. He's a poser and likes to take things from other guitarists. His lyrics are not well written. He throws words together and his own material is bland and boring.
0790725657|5.0|A Little Princess is a timeless classic for children of all ages.  The tagline is \\"Every girl is a princess.\\"  The movie shows that is true, and will bring many lumps to your throat.<br /><br />The story is about young Sarah, who has been brought up in British India.  She and her widowed father are each other's world.  Sarah thrives in the mystical tropical environment, learning tales of Rama and his consort from her Indian governess.  When WWI breaks out, her father is sent to the front lines.  Before he ships out, he enrolls Sarah in an exclusive American girls' finishing school, run by Mrs. Minch.<br /><br />When Sarah's father is killed in action, and the cheques stop coming, Mrs. Minch makes the independent girl a servant.  Sarah survives only with the help of a mysterious Indian manservant who takes care of the elderly man across the street.<br /><br />The score in the movie is beautiful, as are the costumes, sets, acting, and story.  Highly recommended.  A few scary scenes for younger children.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I love this show... I could watch it over and over again, it is funny and you will never be tired of it! 5 stars!!!
B000002AS3|5.0|Nevermind anyone that gives this album less than 4 stars, as they dont fully understand what good music is all about. I can guarantee you that much. This is one of the greatest albums of all time from my favorite band and theres a good reason for that.
0062515675|3.0|If a book is full of wisdom, but in the form of a cheesy story packed with lots of cliches ... then is it a good book or not? <br /> <br />This is the issue I wrestled with in reading the Ferrari-less Monk. Much of the time I was cringing (\\"world class litigator\\" etc) ... and yet every few pages I found a delicious thought, mostly quotes from other sources, that made me glad I had perservered.  <br />So, although I can understand why other reviewers seems to hate it, or love it ... I think it falls somewhere in-between. <br /> <br />If you haven't bought it yet, there are plenty of other books that do a better job (Siddhartha, The Alchemist etc). However, if you've got a copy on your desk and are wondering whether or not to read it ... I'd suggest you only speed-read the crappy narrative and focus on the ideas and quotes instead!
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I must say, this film completely threw me for a loop, mainly because I didn't expect it to be so good. Typically, remakes don't ever have the charisma and energy of the original but if any do it would be this one.<br /><br />The actions of the tribal people once Denham's people reach Skull Island appears to be more of a calloused reaction to the others who have come to Skull Island trying to exploit the island that time forgot. It would also be fear of the monsters that inhabit the island, and what would happen to them if explorers came stirring up trouble with the monsters. I say this because there has been a little bit of talk about racism in this movie, but I don't find it to be racist at all, there's also a scene where a black man on the crew turns out to be the most noble and brave of them all. If anything the reactions in the scenes with the tribes would show racism toward the white people, who think they own everything and have the right to exploit an island and it's living creatures.<br /><br />The movie is very violent, but is virtually bloodless. The fighting sequences do have a tendency to be shaky and jumpy, and depending on the viewer this can become a little frustrating, it didn't bother me at all though. Of course, like any movie dealing with dinosaurs, an island that time forgot, and a massive ape there are a lot of things that seem too unreal, but that's because it's a movie where everything is not real. Isn't one of the points of a movie escapism though? So we really shouldn't be worried about whether or not vines could hold up a squirming T-rex. (Although if you wanted to point that out as an unrealistic fact of the movie, remember that this is the place that time forgot.)<br /><br />There is a very creepy scene dealing with a bunch of bugs in a kind of valley like area. In this scene, a bunch of creatures that appear to look like crickets, leeches, grubs, etc. come out of mud and caves around the area to devour the crew that's out searching for Anne Darrow. This is the breathtaking spider sequence that was cut from the original version of this movie. As this is a monster movie, it seemed appropriate, especially to give you a good idea of what kind of place Skull Island is. The movie doesn't insinuate that nature is a very dangerous place if you can tell reality from fiction. (Especially considering that most cave dwelling creatures are fragile, blind, and totally harmless.) Skull Island though, is not typical nature, it's a forgotten island that is nearly uninhabitable, which is one of the draws for Carl Denham.<br /><br />There are a lot of questions that people can ask when going to see a movie like this, but why would you want to ask them? There's no point to question movies like this because their made for fun, their made to stretch technology, and to live out a filmmaker's dream, the dream that made him become a filmmaker. So don't question it, go along for the ride and have fun.<br /><br />P.S.-The movie is rated PG-13 for a reason. Take your kids into the movie with caution, I would recommend viewing the movie before them. (I work in a video store, and there we aren't even aloud to view PG-13 movies in the store for the cursing and the questions they bring up.) While King Kong isn't as graphic in some ways as Titanic, Titanic is a perfect example of why you would want to view the movie prior to allowing children to view it.for Anne Darrow.

B0009UC7H0|5.0|I don't know why anyone would want to put this movie down. I am not a Clive Cussler fan and have never read or listened to his novels. But after seeing this film I think I am going to give Cussler a try. I rented this movie and watched it with my family today and I liked it so much I took it back to the video store the same evening and bought my own copy. Matthew McConaughey was great as Dirk Pitt and I hope he will return for another film as the gallant hero along with the hilarious Steve Zahn at his side. Does the next film have to have Penelope Cruz...no. I would pick Izabella Scurrupco for the next female lead. This was a summer popcorn flick that I wished I had gone to see when it came out but never got the chance to. I hope others won't read the negative reviews of this film no matter if you are a Cussler fan or not, do yourself a favor and check this film out.
0441172717|5.0|Only twice in my life have I been so enthralled by a book I've read it cover-to-cover without stop.  \\"Dune\\" was one of them. <br /> <br />In \\"Dune\\", Frank Herbert created both a world and a future universe so complete and wondrously rich in every way that it's impossible to convey even a small portion of what makes it so compelling. <br /> <br />Take the human race as it might be several thousands of years in the future... scatter it through the stars... bring back a new form of space-going feudalism... infuse it with philosophies and religions never before known... introduce human computers, blood feuds, intrigues and political machinations Macchiavelli would have been proud of... people it with mysterious desert tribesmen who ride great 100-meter-long sandworms for transport... top it all with a millenia-long breeding program designed to fulfill a prophecy... and bind it all with \\"melange\\", the spice that is the only thing that enables star-pilots to navigate between the stars.  This gives you just the tiniest glimpse of what makes Dune one of the classic science-fiction novels of all time. <br /> <br />The story takes place on Arrakis, a planet where water is so scarce a person can be killed for the water held in their flesh.  It is also the only place where the fabulous spice melange is found.  And melange is the greatest source of wealth and power in the galaxy.   <br /> <br />Young Paul Atriedes is swept up in this world of danger, mystery, sand and spice, and before he is through, he'll become a messiah to an entire world... or die in the attempt.
B00000099Y|5.0|first of all tool like many other artists out there is an abstract kind of band, you need to be kind of minded and patient while listening to their music. also this album in paticular has a such a different sound compared to most of the stuff released now a days. compared to other music i heard this album has a sense of ORIGINALITY that died in music during the late 80's early 90's. tool with a couple of other artists have remained FRESH and ORIGINAL. \\"Ænima\\" in my opinion is one of the greatest albums ever, it's timless and is as great as Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". all in all tool is an aquired taste and should only be ingested by opened minded people. no a cliche 90's album to say the least. so if you're not opened minded and/or a hardcore christain than this album isn't for you. for the creative contents of this album might confuse or scare the close minded listener.
0712654593|5.0|\\"The Firm\\" still remains John Grisham's best novel, but \\"The Rainmaker\\" is far and away his funniest. I have never read a book that better managed to hit my funny bone straight on without tipping over the edge into farce (i.e., John Irving at his best). This time around Grisham's would be hero is Rudy Baylor, in his final semester of law school and required by one of his professors to provide free legal advice at a Senior Citizens home. There he meets Miss Birdie, an old lady who apparently has millions of dollars salted away and who definitely needs a new will, and Dot Black, who's son Donny Ray is dying of leukemia while their insurance company refuses to pay for medical treatment. In the legal world a \\"rainmaker\\" is someone who brings in big clients (i.e., big money) to a law firm. When Rudy's future job suddenly disappears in the wake of a surprise merger, these cases might be his ticket to a promising legal career.<br /><br />The villains are lawyers from a giant firm and a heartless insurance company, which is certainly stacking the deck but part of the fun as Grisham pours it on. As with \\"The Pelican Brief\\" there is a bit of misdirection at the beginning in terms of getting a read on the main character. Rudy is broke and has some shady friends in the legal profession, but the bottom line is he is a good guy and he will do the right thing. Even if it means playing David against Goliath in a stacked courtroom where the presiding judge is best buds with the great Leo F. Drummond of the giant law firm Trent & Brent, representing the Great Benefits Insurance Company. But then Rudy gets a break. The presiding judge suddenly drops dead and his replacement, Judge Kipler, is a plaintiff's dream.  Rudy also has the truth on his side, but believe me, having the presiding judge on your side and having a key piece of damming evidence fall into your lap and finding the missing witness that has disappeared are all more important in the end.<br /><br />The joy of this book is watching little Rudy beat the big bad guys. Every single lawyer's trick used by Drummond fails with Judge Kipler. Every dirty trick by the insurance company is exposed by Rudy, who comes up with some little twists of his own. Sure, all the rabbits getting pulled out of the hat is a bit excessive, but that is what makes this such a fun read. At the heart of this book is the quest for justice, but that does not mean we can not enjoy a little payback along the way. The romantic subplot between Rudy and Kelly comes across as something of a diversion from the main story, but at the end it gives the hero someone with whom he can ride off into the sunset. \\"The Rainmaker\\" is one of those books where you pick it up from time to time to read the good parts. If you saw the movie and enjoyed Rudy sticking it to the bad guys, then you should enjoy much more of the same in this novel.ok is watching little Rudy beat the big bad guys.

B000BB1MIC|5.0|The fourth season of \\"Gilmore Girls\\" was my least favorite to date because essentially Lorelia and Rory spent the year treading water.  The finale of the third season, \\"Those Are Strings, Pinocchio,\\" was when Luke had the dream about Lorelia asking him not to go on the cruise with Nicole, which created a nice bookend with the third season premier, \\"Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days,\\" when Lorelia had the dream about Luke. Clearly something was being set up for the fourth season, but the payoff was deterred all the way until the final episode, at which point Luke finally kissed Lorelia, Lorelia kissed him back, and then Rory went and lost her virginity to Dean, who happened to be married to Lindsay.  Obviously the series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino is well aware of all those romantic comedies that died as soon as the bickering couples consummated their love (\\"Moonlighting\\" being the paradigmatic example of such a fate).  Still, waiting until the end of the fourth season to have Luke and Lorelai finally kiss was sheer agony.<br /><br />Between the first kisses and the consummation devoutly to be wished, the impediments came from other Gilmores.  \\"Goodbye to Daisy Miller\\" has Lorelai worried about Rory and Dean, and then learning that her parents are separated.  Fortunately Emily takes Rory to Europe and this actually gives Lorelai and Luke the necessary alone time.  Ultimately \\"Gilmore Girls: The Complete Fifth Season\\" is about cementing the ties that bind between Luke and Lorelai.  By the end of this season they have become one in every way that matters short of cohabitation and marriage, and are clearly moving in those directions.  All of the best moments in this season have to do with those two, while Rory gets thrown off track by falling into the orbit of Logan Huntsburger and his family.<br /><br />The fifth season has several of my all-time favorite moments in the series to date and two moments when I was a-feared the show was jumping the shark.  My first favorite moment comes in \\"Written in the Stars\\" when Luke and Lorelai go on their first date, he recalls the first time they met, and shows her what is in his wallet.  Of course he is all in.  Then there is the moment at the end of \\"Wedding Bell Blues,\\" when Lorelai has learned from Christopher that Emily was encouraging him to rekindle their romance.  As Lorelai was being dragged over for the wedding photography I was yelling at my television for Lorelia to \\"nuke\\" her mother, by which I meant to pull out the biggest nuclear device in her possession and drop it on Emily, which, I believe is exactly what she does.  There was a close call for another great moment off of this plot line when Rory blows up at her grandmother in \\"So...Good Talk,\\" but it fell short of my requirements (I want Rory to say to Emily, just once, \\"Grandmother, I love you a whole lot, but no matter what you do or what happens I will never love you more than I love my mom\\").  My second favorite moment is the end of \\"A House is Not a Home,\\" and I am talking not only of Lorelia's final question of the season but the whole range of thoughts and emotions that Lorelai goes through right before she pops the question.  Why Lauren Graham does not at least get nominated for an Emmy for Best Actress in a Comedy Series is beyond comprehension (but neither did Sarah Michelle Gellar or any other actress from the WB).<br /><br />My first fears of shark jumping proved to be a false alarm, but in the wake of the wedding debacle I did not buy it when Luke tells Lorelai in \\"Say Something\\" that they could not be together.  As the town elder points out in \\"Blame Booze and Melville,\\" Luke has been waiting for Lorelai for a long time and he should be able to weather the perpetual hurricane that is Emily Gilmore.  Fortunately Lorelia's phone call at the end of the episode changes the dynamic (Look at Luke's face: I swear he is ready to take her back right then).  I should point out that my third favorite moment of the season is what accompanies Judy Garland singing \\"The Man Who Got Away\\" from \\"A Star is Born\\" at the end of \\"So... Good Talk.\\"<br /><br />However, I had much greater concerns over what happens in \\"Blame Booze and Melville\\" when Mitchum Huntzberger lowers the boom on Rory and she decides to drop out of Yale.  I personally think that a gopher/intern should keep their mouth shut in meetings of the senior staff at a newspaper.  In the sixth season in \\"We've Got Magic to Do\\" it is suggested that Mitchum actually believes what he is saying, but I still find it hard to believe.  But the resulting split between Lorelai and Rory is really the province of the sixth season, and while I agree that the dramatic consequences of such a rift was worth pursuing at this point in the series, I simply think that dropping out of Yale and moving in with grandma and grandpa was not the way to go (I waited in vain for Paris to really read Rory the riot act).  But as the nadir of the series plays out against Claudin Longet singing \\"I Think It's Going To Rain\\" when Rory turns away from her mother, it also serves to set up the beauty of the cliffhanger that was never a cliffhanger.<br /><br />\\"Wedding Bell Blues\\" was the show's 100th episode so it gets special treatment with the DVD extras here.

B000AWYOGE|2.0|Jennifer Connelly does an exceptional acting job in this film that creates a dark wet soggy atmosphere for 100 minutes, but never develops any substance.<br /><br />The film seems like a study in using atmosphere to set a mood but little more.<br /><br />Does anybody else notice that RING, RING 2, GRUDGE and now DARK WATER are all the same story slightly rehashed and done over and over again ?<br /><br />Amazing they have been able to make money by making the exact same movie 4 times from the same basic story (ie... lost or neglected kid and water coming from beyond the grave)<br /><br />This was hard to take serious with nothing but drips, water leaks and geysers for 90 minutes...... and of course it was not helped any with the ending kind of given away in the first 15 minutes.<br /><br />HINT..... as mentioned above, this is a quick rehash of Ring and Grudge, etc...
B00025ETIW|1.0|You know that album you buy as a teenager and regret you liked them when you actually understand music and true emotions and everything?  (Mine was Offspring's \\"Smash\\" album)  Well, this album reaks of \\"Oh my god. This album goes nowhere.\\"  Pop-punk garbage through and through which would be good if the band didn't seem so damn fake and produced to sound like a Used ripoff.  In fact, they play out like a band who were fans of screamo, so they started a band, ripped off the Addicts \\"Clockwork Orange\\" style, and tried repackaging the whole idea as MCR.  Sad.<br /><br />Obviously the sound isn't developed to create anything with intelligence but merely lyrics which react to a fake car crash or want to shock a teenager's ears by even talking about slitting your wrists.  I don't feel sorry for this guy; I want to turn it off or at least change the CD to the Used or Against Me!...or how about good punk (the Clash, Crass, TSOL, Dead Kennedys)?<br /><br />Don't get sucked in by the kids who buy this album by the buttload in Hot Topic stores throughout the nation.  If you want disposable CDs to have your parents waste their money on, buy rap, not this stuff.
0060987464|5.0|I recently finished reading this book. I found it quite interesting. I'm there were it's revolting moments of sex and drugs but that was apart of it all. I actually found several pieces of it quite intelligent or completely sarcastic and funny. You defintely might want to consider reading this if you have any interest in Marilyn Manson. I particularly thought the last half of the book was extremely interesting surronding the creation of the album Antichrist Superstar. To put it in short terms after I got this book I was reading it ever spare moment I had. If I could have I would have read it all in one sitting. I rarely do this with books. This was the first book in six months that was able to hold my attention and let me finish it.
B000068PQ0|3.0|I had never caught on when this band made a comeback after I remembered them as the band who sang the grunge-era hit \\"Tangerine,\\" so I was confused as to what they were supposed to sound like.  I was somewhat pleased to see that they were creative enough to combine such easy-going music with such weird synths and simplistic beats, but the other side of me wanted more of that guitar-craziness that I remember them for back in yesteryear.<br /><br />The vocals are OK, but they sing of crazy stories that are hard to grasp (which actually should be a posiive thing).  The standout instrument on this album is the synthesizers which provide the strange layers on this album.  They really give this CD a creative edge on other bands that might have similar sounds to them, but no real additives.  The guitarist was somewhat lost on the album, replaced by synth-bass or simply having a spotlight as an acoustic guitar on a track in the backgroound.<br /><br />Their hit \\"Do You Realize\\" really switched the album from an easy-going album to a spiritual journey, which makes the track a good choice to have as their single from this album.  Whether or not some people think it saves the record is up for debate, but I thought the album fell short of greatness based on the simple layout of the types of tracks with each other.  (They didn't really vary too far from each other.)  I was hoping for a more grand-scale creative band, I think.<br /><br />Check it out if a friend has it, but I wouldn't buy it for one song that was a decent single.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I get the impression that some fans of the Hellblazer books did like approve of this film.  I liked the film.  It was one of of the few 2005 films that I did like.  My advice for the Hellblazer fans is : if you don't like the film, then don't buy the DVD. Otherwise grow up and stop whining.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|The Arcade Fire remind me of the typical bands of the 2000s: a lot of basic song-building techniques accompanied with not-likely instruments that haven't been put together and it ends up sounding like Coldplay.  I'm not impressed by the Arcade Fire, but they do have a great, solid sound to their musicianship.<br /><br />The singer drives me up the wall with his whiny-tinged vocals which drives the CD down considerably.  I could take his vocals on a couple of the tracks (the 3rd Neighboorhood song and Crown Of Love), but more than anything, they drag me into a depressed hole and cover me with dirt of basic guitar riffs.<br /><br />Some songs sounded like they were trying to be U2, others have such a style about them that they seem near plagiarization (like Crown Of Love which sounds a lot like the Righteous Brothers Unchained Melody, doo-wop style).  I really liked the second to the last song, Haiti, though, probably because it sounds so new and different with a female vocalist (Regine Chassagne).<br /><br />You'd do better to check out bands like My Morning Jacket or Beck.  Download this if you want, but I wouldn't go out and get the CD.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|Since this is supposed to be based on a true story (I'm sure it has a lot of hollywood hype), it made me wonder why the medical community didn't Baker Act this woman (insane people CANNOT make legal decisions regarding their care not being of sound mind), restrain her due to her violent and self mutilating outbursts, and put a nasogastric tube for feeding whilst giving her antipsychotic drugs which were available during the last 60's, thus controlling her behaviour to allow therapy to commense.  Thus, we witnessed an example of the medical community being negligent. <br /> <br />She had all the classic symptoms of schizophrenia: Going mad during young adult years, extreme paranoia to the point of starving herself due to terrifying \\"visions\\" and other hallucinations. The hallucinations-both auditory and visual, are indeed extremely terrifying. Yet the priest got away with \\"caring\\" for this sick indivdual leading to her death--I do know when an adult takes the responsibility for caring for another-they also take legal responsibilites-yet he got away with feeding this young woman's delusions with exorcisms causing her demise by feeding more into her delusions. This is, to me, no different than showing live snakes to someone going into Delirium tremors! To me this rang some kind of legal system negligence that the Court did not speak for the rights of that deceased sick girl, on her behalf. And what happened to the parents who didn't hopitalized their starving daughter at the very least for nutritional support (the cause of her death was self starvation and multiple self mutiliations.) <br />    <br />According to the movie Emily Rose had a \\"vision\\" of the Mother of God, and she asked why the devils were not cast out. \\"It's to prove to the world that God exists by showing the devil\\". Does that have a ring of truth to it? Why not, instead, show multiple genuine healings for proof of God--cure cancers, true blindness, diabetes, and other measurable things. This would notonly alleviate suffering, but bring people to believe.  Just by her deliusion, you could tell the young woman was just crazy.  <br /> <br />The priest claims to have seen a \\"clocked figure\\" every night, yet had NO camera to document this myseterious spectre. Cameras were available in the late 60's. Also no photos were taken during the excorcism to document strange phenomena. Mostly likely because there were none to photograph other than maniac screams and violent outbursts: The ravings of a lunatic.  <br />  <br />The movie was nothing short of spectacular. To me it showed our medical, legal, and religious communities screwing up as they did not protect the rights of a very sick individual who was not of sound mind and body thus could not--was not able--to make her own decision, and the systems of our medical, legal, and religious communities--pillars of our society--that let her down. <br /> <br />To me that was what the movie was all about. I think it was awesome that special effects were not overdone, thus making possession scenes as plausible as possible. Possession in terms of manifestations of mental illness and delusions rather than devils is frightening enough--yes it's true sometimes mentally ill people can have super human strength because they are crazy. <br /> <br />I think it's the BEST exorcism movie ever made.  <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />

0064409422|4.0|Did you even hide into a wardrobe when you were a kid playing hide-and-seek? If so, you might have been imagine that there is something more than clothes in the wardrobe. <br /> C. S. Lewis presents a story of four children passed a wardrobe to Narnia-a fantastic world-in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the Chronicle of Narnia. Lucy, the youngest girl of four children, found an enormous wardrobe in the Professor's house then stepped into another world which was totally different as the world she came from. It was winter but never Christmas, told by Mr. Tumnus, a faun that Lucy met at the lamp-post. This land is called Narnia and was over controlled by the Witch, who is mean and ordered Mr. Tumnus to catch human beings if he saw any. Virtuous Tumnus did not obey her, and started a friendship with Lucy. However, other three children, Peter, Susan and Edmund, did not believe in Narnia. Then, Edmund went to there meet the Witch, and enchanted by her magic and lies. Since Lucy wanted to show she is right and the magic on Edmund, four of them all went into Narnia, but found that Mr. Tumnus got caught. Whereafter, they met Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and been told the King Aslan is on the way, just then Edmund ran away stealthily to the Witch. The Witch did not tread him as she promised, and then Edmund realized that he was wrong. Meanwhile, the other three met Santa with the Beavers, and got present for the battle with the Witch. After they met Aslan, Edmund got rescued and out of the Witch's magic control because of the deal between Aslan and the Witch. Come through the battle, they became the Kings and Queens of Narnia and grew up. Finally, when they came back to this world, they are still little children, but it is just a start of Narnia. <br /> Sometimes, we grown-ups might loss dreams, imaginations and something important of our personality, and sometimes I wish I could back to my childhood just like these four children. Just like other fairy tales, characters would win by their kindness and loss by their mean, but The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a little bit more than that. While you are reading it, you would be easily mesmerized, just because it worth it. <br />
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is an amazing autobiography about Frank McCourt and the tales of his life from childhood to his late adolescence when he returns to America. Frank McCourt was born in Brooklyn, New York, the 19th of August 1930, and lived there with his brothers, sister, and his parents. Frank grows up with the natural instinct of questioning everything he sees. Once a neighbor of his sees Frank and his brother Malachy in the playground on a cold day and says, \\"they don't have a glove between them,\\" and Frank writes, \\"that makes me laugh because I know Malachy and I have four hands between us and one glove would be silly.\\" Having to help his mother bathe his other siblings at a young age and his father always drinking the weekly wages was considered normal to him. Even as a child Frank understands some emotions of his mother. He knows that she tries to provide for him and his siblings with the little money Frank's father brings home. Frank struggles with deaths in the family, along with the on going poverty he is faced with day-to-day. He has one shirt for his every activity. His shoes have holes in them and uses what he can to repair his them, along with his clothing. He tries to be a good Catholic and prays because of his wrongdoings.  Frank grows up with theses surroundings and to him it is home. He dreams of growing up so he can become the man of the family and take care of his mother and siblings. He wants a better life for them, so that they never have to be ashamed. His story is a tearjerker, bursting at every moment of the book. It makes one realize how blessed one is and how the lives of others sometimes aren't. An excellent read.
0062515675|1.0|I dont know what to say about these extremely childish works who claims to be philosophical and helps in self development. It is nothing but a coloured excretion of eastern philosphy. Just filth. Completely a misguide to what eastern philosphy says about life. Aims only the temporary satisfaction of poor,childish and depressed people. Nowadays it has become a good business writing this kind of crap.
0062502174|1.0|Just by using the powerful words like 'Destiny' the author has tried to build up an illusion that it is a philosophical book. In no way it is superior than Fairy tales or ordinary bed time stories. The sad thing is a lot of people have been carried away by the pseudo philosophy of the book. It is highly superstitious and useless for adults. May be used for entertaining small kids.

B00005JOFO|5.0|Yes, Ang Lee's love story is a great movie. It's a hearbreaking, visually stunning Western. It's really well acted, particularly by Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams, brilliantly written, original and incredibly moving. Most critics have acknowledged this. But what makes BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN such a revelation is because it's a gay movie. That's what makes the film important. That's where it breaks new ground. That's why it matters. A friend of mine says that the only reason the film is generating so much buzz is because it's gay, that if it were a straight Western romance it wouldn't garner attention. I told him he was right, but I told him it was because his \\"straight Western romance\\" had already been made. Many people have commented that the film's theme is universal, applicable to all audiences. Sheep herders Jack and Ennis find themselves in love in 1963 and don't have a context with which to deal with those feelings. Those who speak of a \\"universal theme\\" say that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is about a romance that its lovers cannot deny yet cannot make work. This is all true, but I think it's unfair to the movie to say that it's really about \\"everyone.\\" I am a gay man, and I couldn't divorce myself from that while watching this movie. Part of the reason I liked it is because I felt, while it was happening, like it belonged to me and spoke for me as a homosexual. I felt its impact, its originality. I wanted to nurture it and tell other people about it. I wanted to learn from it, and I wanted others to see it and learn. It's a story that I've been waiting for, even though I didn't know it. The documentary THE CELLULOID CLOSET, released several years ago, showed us Hollywood's history of how it subtly hid yet depicted homosexuality. If gay people wanted to see gay stories, they had to go into straight movies and \\"decode\\" the hidden gay themes. With BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, gay people are, for once, not the ones who have to dig in order to relate to the film's \\"universal\\" message. This is our movie, and it's a great one, a cause for celebration.universal\\" message. This is our movie, and it's a great one, a cause for celebration.
B00005JOHI|2.0|I was skeptical in the beginning, then I read the great reviews as well as some first hand accounts of how good this movie was and I had to see it. In fact, I was pretty excited about it. <br /> <br />As we started watching the movie, we were like, \\"Why can't we understand what they're saying.\\" The first half-hour seemed muffled, then they spoke more clearly. <br /> <br />On the movie, I thought it was just OK. This version didn't need to be made. A much better version exists out there and that's the 1995 A&E version. Too many scenes were shortened to accommodate for time and I think it hurt the movie. I don't think there was chemistry between Lizzy and Mr. Darcy. Lydia's character should have been expanded on as well as Mrs. Bennet to understand these characters. Mr. Wickham was barely there and you don't know how terrible his unless you've read the book. By the other characters telling us his story doesn't help us loathe him the way we should. I could go on but there isn't enough space. <br /> <br />On the positive side: the Cinematography was very good and the ending, though completely fabricated, gave it a nice ending, hence the two stars given.
B00005JOHI|5.0|Of all the movies on my Top 10 list, this adaptation of Jane Austen's classic was the one I was the most reluctant to include because it's light and airy, it's a story that I've seen done before and because I knew a lot of Austen fans don't like it because it takes liberties with her apparently sacred text. But then I thought about the movie itself and how I felt swept up in it while it played in front of me. This new PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a thoroughly engaging, lushly romantic time at the movies, presenting us with two brilliant, headstrong characters who are too stubborn to admit that they love each other. In this year of surprisingly strong performances that seem to come out-of-nowhere, Keira Knightley achieves the nearly impossible by making the role of Elizabeth Bennet entirely her own. By minimizing every part of the story that didn't deal directly with Elizabeth, director Joe Wright and screenwriter Deborah Moggach have created a swift, fun adaptation of the work that just keeps building momentum. It's thoroughly charming.
6300182355|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I listened to those \\"very knowledgable\\" experts that said this would be released in a Region One 25th Anniversary DVD in Fall 2005.  2005 was soon to be over so I wrote Universal Studios looking for further information.  Well, I just got an email from them confirming that there are no plans to release this title again EVER.  If you waited like I did, then wait no longer.  As for me, I'm going to buy the DVD before they are either too expensive for the ordinary person or they have vanished altogether.
B000AWYOGE|5.0|I did enjoy the theatrical  edition, but the unrated disc  takes the experience to a whole new level. It is an ambivalent level, since the special features specifically state that  there are \\"two explanations\\" for  all the things that happen, i.e.  one psychological, one supernatural. However, this seems to be more of a producers pretensions of grandeur, than a real explanation.  It is a film that indulges in more of a character  driven  exposition of the story, so that in that respect, you  have to work more at enjoying the film. It's  definitely not an FX  driven film, but as the special  features  show, there are \\"FX\\" done so that the sound stage in Canada can be integrated with the Roosevelt island  background. The sound is totally awesome , in that with a 5.1  system, and the sound turned up, you can experience what is a very edgy film in this unrated version.  Play times for the film vary, some say  103, some, like  AMAZON, say 105, and overall this is not clear, but the extra few, or the different few minutes done in this  edit pay off immensely in a very watchable, listenable, and experiential  film.  The extras are very enjoyable; they add to the experience of the film, and show in detail, the elements of the almost indie film. The power is really in the casting for the  script, and whilst the editing could have flowed a little  better, the sound covers much of the fragmented editing. And the sound is clearly an additional character/feature to the film ( as is the water, to say the least). The deleted scenes are not many, but at least one scene  should have stayed in ... worth seeing this part to see if the scenes should have stayed the same or not. Whilst the visual editing is debatably fragmented, it might be that the fragmenting expresses a side of the characters experience... but, thats in the eye of the beholder, I assume.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|One of the most amazing films I've seen this year, if not ever.  Excellent acting, the story keeps you in the film from start to finish.  This is one of those movies that you become part of and completely lose yourself in it.  Never even knew they had a tv serious, but the people who worked on this project did a great job.
0393316041|5.0|Einstein gets all the glory but Feynman in my opinion was way better, much better scientist. Reading his Misadventures was a real treat. I like to think of myself as a Feynman in training but I have to admit that I'm nowhere near as good, yet! Right now the only thing I got going is my sense of humor which just like Feynman's is a bit warped however he was a master of math and all the sciences (except Biology which isn't really a science) Don't get me wrong biochemistry yes, Biology no. Unless I'm dating a really sexy biology mayor then biology really is a science /\_/\ (If you know what I'm saying). To all you ordinary Hate science people out there this book doesn't try and explain anything. Sure he talks about it a little but the bulk is just his crazy life and his crazy interaction with people. There is only six words to say, \\"You can't make this S*** UP!\\"

B0006L16N8|1.0|If this is meant to be the greatest album of 2005, then its been a crap year thats all I can say.  Cold Play are a total rip off of U2, same echos, same rythms, and this guy cant sing.  As soon as he gets to the high notes, it sounds like he can barely hold onto it.  The songs are 'poppy' - Speed of Light and 'Fix you' God, how can anybody enjoy this dribble?  U2 set the standard in the early 80s and all Cold Play are doing is cashing in a very spacious market at the moment, cause there aint that many bands out there.  If you like this kind of tosh, then waste your money and buy.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Being American means that my first experence with Muse was with Absolution.  Well Live 8, followed by videos on various websites then the purchase of Absolution.  When I heard the OoS was getting released in the states I was giddy.  I'd already streamed many of the songs from Muse's official website (they've put nearly all of them up for your preview listen) when I bought this.  New Born, Bliss, Hyper Music, Plug in Baby and Feeling Good were all easy for me to get into right for the beginning.  Bliss in particular may be the single most energy-enriched song ever.  The album is a bit hard to slip into at first but repeated listens will result in the discovery of muilti-layered instruments, all so carefully thought in that they blend, and a vocal performance that is brilliant.  The songs that turned me away at first later become some of my favorites.  Dark Shines, Citizen Erased and Megalomania all have evolved into favorites over time.  CE in particular sums up all that Muse is with roaring guitar riffs, joyfully overwelming energy, moving vocals, all pushed along by Chris's bass and Dom's Drums until falling off into a gentle piano conclusion.  Stunning work on Matt's part and it would all be for not without the often ignored members backing him up.  An intense and energetic experence without rivil and at least for now (Jan 2006) it's Muse's masterpiece.

The Characters I wanted to know more about, Jon Snow, Bran, Danerys aren't in this book at all. I flipped to the back and read he's saved them all for another book to focus on those characters. This is the like the wheel of time all over again....nothing much happens in the book, it tooks ages for the publisher to release it and now I've to wait until next year to read about the characters I care about ?!! Dooh !! I'll probably pick it back up when I've nothing else to read but I'll be waiting for the paperback of his next book this time.....I feel cheated.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Very good album, highlights are the songs with tempo changes: Glosoli, Saeglopur,Gong.This is the first Sigur Ros album for me, and reminds me lots to Slowdive but their music is more complex.This is a ticket to dream being awake,the album is a soundtrack on it`s own.Takes time to appreciate this kinda music,either it`ll grow on you after repeated listens or you will think it`s just boring.For me this is beautiful.
0385486804|4.0|\\"Into The Wild\\" by Jon Krakauer is a terrifying, yet intriguing true novel about how a man left everything to live a life similar to a nomad.  This young gentleman's real name is Christopher McCandless, but along the journey refers to himself as Alexander Supertramp.  He left everything: family, money, friends, and possessions to live a life of hitchhiking and complications.  Christopher starts off by leaving his college in Florida, and begins hitchhiking to every corner of the country.  Some of his places of interest include South Dakota, Arizona, California, and Colorado.  He meets friends along the way that he will keep contact with every few months.  His friends drive him places, and feed him when he is hungry.  Christopher, however, doesn't stay with these friends for more than two weeks at a time, and keeps on his journey.  Along the way he sleeps in tents and sleeping bags.  Eventually, after more than two years of traveling he comes to the conclusion that he wants to try and hitchhike to live in Alaska.  His last ride in Alaska by Jim Gallien left him on the Stampede Trail in Denali.  Christopher lived there for around four months, and made a living for himself.  Eventually he couldn't compete with the living conditions and atmosphere, and he dies of starvation.  His body was found by hunters who got State Troopers to take him away.  Everything else about Christopher McCandless is left a mystery except the pieces of the puzzle Jon Krakauer tries to piece together in \\"Into The Wild.\\" <br /> <br />Krakauer's novel is a wonderful read that will not leave you confused, rather wanting more.  He uses very descriptive language of the land, and makes it seem like you are there, holding your shivering thumb up with Christopher.  Krakauer uses a variety of descriptive words to captivate the mood and surroundings at all times.  The various encounters that Krakauer shares help you to get a real sense of what happened to Christopher, and help to give you a lead on the missing pieces.  Krakauer sets the mood from the beginning, and never leaves you hanging on a loose detail.  I would recommend this book to everyone who wants to read a nonfiction book that interesting and leaves you intrigued should check out this book.  This hard to put down book is wonderful for an audience of adults or teens.  You don't need any prior information; just an open mind into someone else's dreamed life.              <br />
0312995423|2.0|The beginning of the book was pretty good. But too many unconvincing events happened when the chase started. Too many fortunate events. And then when the plot begins to unravel, there are too many questions left unanswered or too many things that just doesn't jive.  <br /> <br />spoilers... <br /> <br />How come only the commander seem to know much of digital fortress and why is it that other entities...even the ones who are interested in buying it never heard of it, or if they heard of it why is that they never investigated it as much as the commander did? <br /> <br />The chief knew who the assassin was and had him shadowed. Then why didn't his operatives did nothing when the assassin started killing all these people. <br /> <br />Tankado was desperate to show his three fingers to the people who attended to him in the park like they would know that that was the passcode. Like duh...how are they supposed to know that. <br />  <br />Tankado \\"taunted\\" them by embedding a clue (about the passcode) in the virus itself. The way he arranged the clue was plain to a teacher so it should have been plain to the geniuses of NSA too but these geniuses are just too dumb to see it.  <br /> <br />How come the NSA geniuses didn't catch on Tankado being NDakota? <br /> <br />How come the same geniuses didn't get the clue (the difference between the Uranium isotopes). If the NSA people are as stupid as  the characters in the book then God Help us. <br /> <br />And the list goes on.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is without a doubt the best pop/hip-hop/soul album since Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" and Janet Jackson's \\"Rhythm Nation.\\" Seldom has an artist captured the spirit and rhythm of her time ahs Mariah has done with this born again production. It will be decades before another artist comes along and mimics this creative genius. My only wish is that Mariah would recognize what a classical and creative genius she is and expose her talent more and her body less!
B000A0GP18|1.0|Aside from Hollywood yet again remaking a film (I write screen plays...), the worst part of the film are it's focus on race which is an historic thing from MTV/Viacom productions.  MTV needs to stay away from movies...    The worst part of this film is Chris Rocks continued, non-funny, coonin minstrel show that he continues to put out there.  If he has a problem with his blackness, HE should deal with it.  Calling black people (...)in front of white (or in Sandler's case, white like) people all of the time is degrading.  He of course would not see it because he is collecting a check(which is all his type cares about) and he thinks that he has 'talent.'    Rock's only talent is being a self-hater.  Making fun of blacks as you routine does nothing for him.  He cooned on SNL because that is all they hire blacks for is to make fun of other blacks.  SNL is another non-funny product.  In this film, there is something racial almost everytime a black person is on screen.  I have not seen the original, but if it had all of those racial elements, then that was the way it was for those times.  It should have been removed for these times.  Watching it made me wonder if I was in 2005 or in 1965!    Rock's facial gestures are on par with Amos N' Andy.  He always plays a weak, scared negro.  CHris Rock has to be the biggest Uncle Tom out there.  He does black people a disservice with hs alleged comedy.  He is really crying for help.  There is a serious problem with someone who gets a kick out of always using the \\"N\\" word around whites and NEVER has anything positive to say about blacks around whites.  This guys sucks.    Now Sandler had some funny moments - in the first 30 minutes!  After that, this film was lame.  Nelly did a respectable job in his acting as did Michael Irving.    Overall, Hollywood - STAY AWAY FROM REMAKES!!!  Hear us loud and clear.  I glad Kong got gonged.
B000002KN8|3.0|This is the debut album from a group called Depeche Mode, four gentlemen from Basildon who perform music entirely with synthesizers.  By the time this record came out, disco met its death, classic rock fell out of vogue, Reaganism and Thatcherism were in full effect, and new wave was continuing to make waves on both sides of the Atlantic.  1981's \\"Speak and Spell\\" will come as a surprise to newer Depeche Mode fans who started their collection with \\"Violator.\\"  For one, the album is penned almost entirely by Vince Clarke, whose style is radically different from Martin Gore, who eventually became the group's main songwriter.  Secondly, much of \\"Speak and Spell\\" is filled of the perky, 80's synth-pop cheese that makes classic rock fans scream in agony.  But underneath the techno Velveeta are a few gems that have endured as DM classics: the icy \\"Dreaming of Me,\\" the catchy \\"New Life,\\" and the hit \\"Just Can't Get Enough.\\"  Other similarly frothy numbers are \\"Photograph,\\" \\"Boys Say Go,\\" and the positively silly \\"What's Your Name?\\" with its repetitive chant \\"Hey, you're such a pretty boy.\\"  As it turned out, Clarke left the Mode shortly after the release of this album (to join Allison Moyet of Yaz, and later Erasure), leaving Gore with the task to fill his shoes.  My three-star rating might raise the ire of some hardcore fans of this album, but it shouldn't be construed as a snub.  I actually like and recommend \\"Speak and Spell,\\" but you must realize that this is a rough debut from a band that hadn't yet formed its identity.  It would take at least a couple more albums for Depeche Mode to fully realize its potential as a great synth pop act.  Dive in.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|Hmmm. After watching (come to think of it, DURING) this fascinatingly appalling excursion into \\"it's not really about the music but more about how to communicate so we can work together long enough to make a multi-platinum album\\" I couldn't help but wonder: have these guys (and by \\"these guys\\" I mean Metallica, its producer-cum-bass player and its management team) ever (1) seen the Beatles doc \\"Let It Be\\" - the best \\"why are we still doing this thing again, when we're fresh out of ideas and obviously can't stand working together anymore\\" and (2) read \\"Walk This Way\\" - the best oral history of a rock band ever. It was like watching \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" but without the laugh track. [Now I know TISP doesn't have a laugh track but every time I watch it with friends the room is full of laughter.] Truth be told, I like Metallica's music.  Even picked up the 5.1 mix of the \\"Black Album.\\" But watching this made me realize how pathetic it can be to watch uneducated people (talented musicians though they may be) try to work on a higher plain. Without parachutes. But it sure is watchable. And laughable. Not in an out-loud way, though. More like in a \\"um, did anyone screen this in the editing room before the final cut was delivered?\\" Sure would love to see what footage DIDN'T make it!
B000BT97AO|5.0|Dave McKean is hands down one of the most overlooked artists of our time, and it really is a shame that this film was given such a limited release in the states.  chances are that many people who like McKean have no idea that he's actually the \\"crazy digital edited picture guy who's done all those album and book covers\\" (as   a friend puts it).  being a huge fan, I was a little worried that, when I finally tracked down a theater that was actually showing Mirrormask, I might be dissappointed with the final product. I left the movie, stepped out the door, took 2 steps, then turned around and bought a ticket for the next show. I only managed to see it twice before it left limited theatrical release, but the second time around I coulden't believe how much of the film's texture I had missed the first time. this movie really happens in layers. you can follow the story, the visuals, the music, or any combination of the total elements, and it plays out very differently depending on how you're watching it. there was really nothing about this movie that ended up leaving me feeling like something had been overlooked or missed out on. <br /> <br />Mirrormask really was just as impressive in every aspect as big budget fluff like Episode III... but americans just don't seem to want to latch on to something that feels like it's too much of an art film - even with the Henson name attatched to it. sadly, this religates Mirrormask to something of a niche market, but I hold great hopes that McKean and company will produce more films, even if that maeans they'll have to pull back some of Gaiman's typically darker writing style and pad it with Labyrinth-ish sillyness.  <br /> <br />all in all, this film really does quietly overshadow the bulk of what hit screens in 05' and it's absolutely worth a look.
B000001DWG|3.0|Firstly, I'd like to start off the lecture with a quote from the moronic reviewer below me..     'The guitar work on Ten was brilliant, but thats probably because they all came from Mother Love Bone'.    Wrong.. STUPID.. Pearl Jam's lead guitarist is Mike McCready.. HE WASN'T IN MOTHER LOVE BONE... Maybe you should know what you're talking about before saying something so uneducated.    You actually think Andy Wood was more creative than Eddie Vedder!? lol! Pearl Jam is 10 times the band mother love bone was > better lyrics, better guitar playing, better SONG-WRITING...At least Eddie plays guitar, & plays it well... Andy didn't even play guitar... PLUS, Eddie was/is a better singer aswell... All around, Eddie slaughters Andy musically.     Mother Love Bone is to Pearl Jam... What Wings was to the Beatles... Only in this case, MLB came first instead of after.     Mother Love Bone was not that great in the overall picture.. Andy Woods lyrics werent very good for starters, nothing compared to Eddies. Also creativity wise? I mean really, are you joking? It's silly MLB has become almost a Pearl Jam rival considering they were the pre-Pearl Jam band... But what I really see here is a lot of MLB fans that prefer MLB's accessible, mainstream 80's sound to Pearl Jam's creativity & experimentation.     Look, there of course are going to be people that think MLB is better than Pearl Jam... But Pearl Jam is the legendary band of the 90s, not MLB.. Do you honestly think MLBs accessible commercial sound wouldve fit in with AIC, Soundgarden, or Nirvana? NO! MLB wouldve never had staying power BECAUSE THE 80S WERE OVER YOU LOSERS!! As a reviewer below me stated, Eddie knew that & was a revolutionary thinker far beyond Andy Wood & brought to Pearl Jam a fresh sounding style that the members of Pearl Jam needed to find... Which they couldn't find in Andy. Sure, at the time MLB was great, certainly better than GnR... But much like GnR... MLB's sound couldn't of fit in with the new generation. Listen to Eddie's band he had before PJ, 'Bad Radio', & you'll see even then Eddie was making a style of music that totally sounded new & for a new generation.     I suppose it would be more accurate to say MLB was 'Bad Company' whereas Pearl Jam was Led Zeppelin...     There are people who prefer Wings over the Beatles   There are people who prefer Bad Company over Led Zeppelin   ... Then, there are the small amount of you people who prefer Mother Love Bone to Pearl Jam..     & childishly, you can't seem to compliment MLB alone without trying to insult Eddie Vedder... Look, Eddie is the bigger icon, he was destined for the greatest Andy only dreamed about, then, like an idiot, Andy overdosed.     Oh, & you also said Andy Wood was tortured, Eddie wasn't? What an idiot you are! Oh yea... 'Stardog Champion' just has SO MUCH more pain than the song 'Black'.. give me a break you moron.     No wonder so many of you MLB fans are bitter against Pearl Jam/Eddie... Pearl Jam's least selling album is still selling about twice as much than this album.. & everyone knows who Eddie Vedder is, he's the icon Andy wish he could've become..    Andy dying is one of the best things to ever happen to music.  It spawned the greatest band of a generation.     Deal with it.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|Batman Begins was good, War of the Worlds was impressive, Revenge of the Sith packed in the audiences but not the excitement, and in movie world it's been a fairly duff year as far as continuing 're-imaginings' and prequel-sequels. Which is where Peter Jackson's  King Kong comes in. At first I didn't really know what to make of this, so few a few days after I was a little ambigous. The computer effects are incredible, and Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts are good. And any film with dinosaurs in it gains another star. But somehow, I was left with an insubstantial feeling, like something hadn't quite clicked. I hadn't watched the 1933 original, so I bought it and watched it after Peter Jackson's version. I know this is controversial, but I think that despite some flaws, the new remake is better than the original.Frankly, I just wasn't that amazed with Merian C Cooper's film. Fay Wray never really connects with Kong, choosing instead to scream all the way to the Empire state building. But what I loved was that T-Rex/Kong fight, and the 2005 remake upps the ante to an almost unbelievable level. Watch out Industrial Light and Magic, Weta Workshop is the new king.<br /><br />Being a New Zealander myself, I can't help but support the films that are made by NZ actors and directors: Russel Crowe, Sam Neil, Anna Paquin, Roger Donaldson, Martin Campbell (Legend of Zorro) However I don't blindy accept and promote everything that comes out of our country (Lord of the Rings had it's flaws, y'know) If King Kong isn't the best film of the year, then it's definitly the best REMAKE of the year. But Kong feels like it could have been directed by anyone, there's no  instantly identifiable mark that says \\"Wow! that is so Peter Jackson!\\" Regardless, it's great entertainment for the easliy-satisfied audiences worldwide, it boasts some of the best action scenes from any movie EVER, and now everyone can finnaly forget the trashy Dino De Laurentiis remake. A technically amazing adventure but actor-wise, it dosn't quite hit the right notes. When you're reaching for material as lofty as this though, it's always difficult. Si if you're looking for a 5-star action movie, watch it and be blown away, but for something more cerebral, check out Kiwi Roger Donaldson's excellent 'World's Fastest Indian'.actor-wise, it dosn't quite hit the right notes.

B000001FKY|1.0|How can a band go from teetering on the edge of pop-metal greatness, as Def Leppard did with [i]Pyromania[/i}, then suddenly do an about face and start jockeying to take Journey's place on the power-ballad parade?  To call this pop-metal is a slap in the face to anyone who likes the volume set on 11.  Or 5.  Plop-metal is more like it because it's the sound these turds make when they start the trip through the waste treatment system.  No wonder Steve Clark drank himself to death.  He probably couldn't stand to look at his sold-out face in the mirror.
B00002RAOU|3.0|[good things]<br /><br />Some of the best kills in slasher movie history, some great blood and a nice cold setting. The acting was pretty good for being an Italian movie, and the characters, at least were very well developed and easy to get along with.<br /><br />[the bad]<br /><br />The actual plot was good, but it really didn't interest me. It (to me) seemed like there was too much going on, and it was hard to watch the movie, enjoy the kills and think about the story. The ending was really lame, It was great how it ended, but I did not like the 2 kids... I just thought it was silly.<br /><br />[final thoughts]<br /><br />I remember watching this movie as a kid, and hating it. Rewatching it years later was a treat, and my opinions were almost opposite of the ones I had back then. The atmosphere in the movie is great, it reminds me of the atmosphere in the first Friday The 13th (Sean S.Cunningham got the inspiration of Friday The 13th from this film), which seems right. It is no secret that Friday The 13th was inspired from this movie, but inspiration and perhaps the setting was the only similarities that I saw. There were 3 kills in this movie that mirrored (almost exactly) kills in the Friday The 13th sequels, which was fun to watch. The kills in the movie are very well done, bloody and really nasty at times.<br /><br />I thought (aside from the intricate plot) was very good, and a very solid slasher flick. A must see for the genre.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Don't be fooled by all the rave reviews from her rabid fans. Critics that find this album as good as \\"Ray of Light\\" have listened to Ray of Light lately. Nothing comes close to the freshness and exuberance of \\"Hung up\\" on \\"Confession\\", not by a mile.  There a few mild hooks smattered throughout the disk but not enough to save this train wreck. I'm not sure what went so wrong with this effort, could be the lack of variety in the (over)production or simply the laziness of our equestrian wanna be pop star. I played \\"Confessions\\" for a good ten days to give it a fair shot but weeks later I forgot I had a copy, bad sign.  I hear she is fearless when riding, apparently not a good thing when riding a horse or trusting to much in your producer. One star for the great Hung Up.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|\\"The strokes defiantly maintain thier image with \\"First Impressions of Earth,\\" however it doesnt translate into thier music. The liner notes are by far and beyond the best aspect of this album. Coupleing cool pop-art with thier lyrics works extremely well. But thats the only pop/excitment and charisma on the album! Whered that feel in the Is This It songs go? Some songs like \\"Red Light\\" the flame of the strokes pop-rock crazyness of past can be seen flickering but the rest of the album is very machinelike and exact. Hope this isnt the last one- the strokes have a great image and are the coolest/hottest band of the 21st century but how about the music?\\"
B00008BRDX|5.0|I first listened to the two main singles from this album, \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"Walking on the Moon,\\" when I bought the greatest hits album.  \\"Walking on the Moon\\" has slowly become my favorite Police song mainly for its simplistic yet hypnotic rhythm and its quirky yet intriguing lyrics.  I had heard the track \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" some time later, and I decided to buy this album.  The same time, I bought Synchronicity, being as that is their final proper album and had some great tracks on it.  The funny thing is this: I found Synchronicity to be a let-down and Regatta de Blanc to be a triumph. <br />The key to this whole album is what the title of is means: White Reggae.  With a heavy influence of reggae, all of the songs come together in a nice fashion.  The lyrics have some bite to it and the music can be fierce when it needs to be, but the Police finally sit back and develop intricate rhythms too all of their songs.  Sting said that he used the spacious reggae bass style because it gave him room to sing, and it absolutely shows here.  He beats the hell out of UB40 when it comes to white reggae singing.  His voice is absolutely unique, a true instrument rather than just a voice.  Summers develops a cool, collected style of guitar, loud when it needs to be, but never too flashy.  Copeland encompasses everything and becomes one of the greatest drummers to walk the planet.  Nothing shows that cohesion more than the instrumental title track, and it deservedly won a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.  That track sums up the album very nicely: a straight rock album with the intricacies of reggae, and it stands just underneath Zenyatta Mondatta as the best of the Police.
B00005JLK1|1.0|Well, your mom probably said the same thing mine did, \\"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything...\\"<br /><br />If I adhered to that adage, this would be a very short review, something like \\"moving the tired old haunted house genre to a 1962-vintage lost cruise ship was clever\\" and \\"Gabriel Byrne does a good Canadian accent.\\"  Oh, and \\"GHOST SHIP is blessedly short!\\"<br /><br />Otherwise, there is not much to say for a cliche film in a tired genre.  It lacks even the fundamentals of good cinematography, decent editing, or passable acting.  The script is so muddled that characters reverse their opinions and act in defiance of the most recent occurence throughout the film.<br /><br />A salvage crew finds a beautiful, lost Italian cruise ship in the Bering Sea.  Just how this large ship stayed afloat for 40 years and never got noticed by satellite imagery or anything isn't clear, but then, neither is anything in this muddled plot.  Greed for the prize leads the salvagers to ignore the supernatural until it is too late.  Ghosts come and go, both good and bad.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that this rather dull and trite film was made by the same man who directed the egregious \\"13 Ghosts\\" a couple years back.  Give both a miss.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|I WAS DEFINITELY AWAITING THIS NEW ALBULM BY THE STROKES.  I HAD HEARD JUICEBOX AND THAT JUST PUMPED ME UP  EVEN MORE.  1ST LISTEN SHOKED ME!!

B0007OCG4W|4.0|Closer is the kind of film you think about long after you've seen it. Usually, I would call that a blessing but given the bleak message here I'm not sure that's the case. It deals with four people, two men and two women, who are divided into couples but the couples change throughout the film. Jude Law plays Dan, a sweet-talking philanderer. He's the type of guy who couldn't hurt a fly but leaves a trail of destruction wherever he goes. Natalie Portman is his long-suffering girlfriend Alice. Julia Roberts is Anna, a photographer who catches Dan's eye and Clive Owen plays Larry, Ana's dermatologist husband. <br /> <br />The movie isn't about relationships as much is it about the mythology surrounding them. The characters espouse their love for one another while they do terrible things to each other. It isn't until the end of the movie that some of them even realize what love really is. It draws a stark line between love and sex. Sex is selfish and love is giving. Throughout the film, the characters greet each other with the line \\"hello, stranger.\\" That seems to be the central theme of the movie, no matter how close we think we are, we will always remain strangers. In the end, one of the couples stays together while the other breaks up. The one that stays together does so because they are willing to accept each other, flaws and all. <br /> <br />The film is wonderfully acted and features tight scripting and excellent cinematography shot around London. Get this one if you love good acting and want something to think about, but just don't expect to be in a good mood when it is over. <br /> <br />
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Great CD and singer! I had no idea who Shakira was before buying this CD for my boyfriend. He was like a little kid, playing it over and over - So i had to listen to it.  Considering Shakira had to first learn English, then learn how to properly speak and write English to compose her lyrics, i am very impressed to say the least.   The songs are very well written but even better sung, and what a set of pipes! Beautiful voice. Glad i bought it and will be buying other CD's as well -- A big feat v. downloading from itunes.   Everyone is entitled to his/her opinion, but those nay-sayers debasing this album have no clue what they are saying and are dead to rights WRONG.  This is a great album, \\"DON't BOTHER\\" is a wonderfully emboldened song, as are the other songs on Vol.2 of the Oral Fixation Album.  For those Amazonian's that say this album stinks.... Get a life. Sure she sings better in spanish - you would too, after 28 yrs of speaking the language v 3 yrs in English.    Illegal, How Do you Do, Don't Bother, Wherever, Whenever are brillant songs, enhanced by her Columbian accent.     I honestly think her English Album deserves much fan support and merits for the effort and brilliance put into it, to the songs and overall achievement of doing a crossover album.    Her Spanish Fixation Vol. 1 album and previous works should not be compared to her English albums, but rather appreciated overall for her talents as a songwriter, composer singer, and for all the guys, the belly stuff.  Hoping she continues to produce English songs and albums, if anything it just reflects the culture of America and the world - variety and that this songwriter/singer is not a lollypop brainless piece of meat, but actually has brains, intelligence and articulates herself through her songs and music, no matter what language.  Ideally, i would love to see Her earlier works translated in English; and v.v for everyone to enjoy all her works in every part of the world, and for the Spanish fans to realize what a great achievement Vol. 2 is.  Viva' English!!!
0553208845|5.0|In the German original, Siddhartha is essentially a prose-poem. Every line sings and sparkles and inspires the reader to continue through the book. This english translation, although accurate and competent, doesn't begin to approach the essence of Hesse's words.<br /><br />German is the language of philosophy and fairy tales and Hesse was obviously a great master of the great language. So, even with this prosaic rendition of his work, it would be hard not to create a brilliant book in English. In the hands of a loving poet, it would mostly likely have been much better.<br /><br />Siddhartha isn't about Buddhism and wasn't intended to be a pseudo-biography of Siddhartha-Gotama, Buddha. Hesse's work goes a step beyond Buddhism, going into what I think is the Chinese philosophy of the Tao. Siddhartha's motivation throughout the book, and ipso facto throughout his life, is to learn the lesson that can't be taught. He says Truth is paradox because no truth exists without it's mirror-image, or shadow. And so, truth cannot be taught. A teacher can only show you one side of the the \\"truth\\" and hence can never show you the whole truth.<br /><br />Time as an illusion is one of his revelations, acheived by listening to the river that has no beginning and no end. With no time dimension, the changes of life, from stone to earth to plant to animal, for example, happen not one after the other but rather all at the same time. And so, the stone IS the earth, and the plant and the animal, all at once. The Buddha is also the thief, the beggar the king. And where there is no reason for unhappiness, there is every reason for love, always.<br /><br />This is not \\"selfish\\" as expressed in a recent review here. This is \\"selflessness\\" in the sense that everything is part your self, my self, and everything is precious :-)<br /><br />Update 28.01.10: I stumbled across the Susan Bernofsky translation of this book and want to be sure to mention it here. I've only read the first chapter as posted at the Amazon link but I feel sure that it comes close to expressing the mood set by the original:<br /><br />[...]at it comes close to expressing the mood set by the original:    [...]
B000B8QEYC|2.0|I've been a fan of Enya for quite a few years now, almost since the get go, and I must say I am rather disapointed with this album. It's not horrible, but I agree with other reviewers....there is just nothing new or exciting to make me want to keep playing it. <br />I am suspiscious about the release of this CD because a few months supposedly Enya used the title track in a Japanese electronics commercial, the company who owned the product leaked the info that one could hear Enya's commercial song on her up-coming CD. This info was then written off on Enya's official website as a misunderstanding...no new CD was due out.  <br />And then lo and behold, not more then 5 months later the CD is released. Was this coincidence? Did she feel the need to throw something out there just so people could pick up the track heard in the commercial? I don't know. I hope not.  <br />I just hope that her next CD is adventerous and exciting and happens within the proximity of 3 years.
0812550706|5.0|This book was highly reccomended to me by a friend, and I really enjoyed reading and dwelling on the book's inner meaning. For a book that had a fairly straight forward plot and simplistic characters up until the very end of the novel, it was amazingly deep and somewhat depressing. I felt every moment of Ender's feelings, the whole book is about what it feels like to be needed, and what people have to throw away to become heroes of warfare.     Ender's game portrays a gentle boy, who has been watched by the military to see if he had what it took to save the world. The choice Ender makes in the very start of the book, is this: To attempt to save the world, and be unsure of success and throw away all chances to return to being a non violent person or to not go away and risk the world being overun. Or is that even the choice at all? Does Ender see something in these so called \\"games\\"  that the military doesn't? The games Ender plays are simulations of combat against aliens. Each time earning a more tough and brutal exterior\\". Even visiting his older sister couldn't change him, he was hardened to the core. And that is exactly what the military wanted. Ender's strategies earn him a reputation and promote him to a commander, giving him more games to play and making fighting Ender's only reason to live. But the games he plays, are they exactly what the simulations say they are, or are they even simulations at all?     Even as Ender fights, his siblings are creating a new identity on the internet, voicing new political opinions and earning a false reputation. What kind of world is Ender fighting for?   Set in a futuristic place, in a war of aliens and humans, of power hungry politicians and genius children who could take over the universe before they're even sixteen years old. This book is disturbing and genuine to the last page, full of infuriating actions of the ruthless Military commanders and the cruel truth about humanity's final decision about other life forms.   Thisbook is an excellent read for all lovers of any Futuristic war game or Anime series. A great Sci Fi for all!
B000B0WODA|4.0|Im not going to go into detail about who they sound like or why.. All I will say is that the 2nd album is very enjoyable and 90% of the album is awesome.. My favorite thing about this album which makes me want to give it 4 stars is that their first single was not the best song on the cd.. How many times does a band do that? Thats my biggest pet peeve.. The 2nd song they released as a single is my absolute favorite song by them.. Good beat, AWESOME lyrics, and different.. Difference is the reason I knocked it from being a 5-star album.. They didnt break away from the typical \\"Sophmore Sound\\" that traps many and most artists (including my favorite The Beatles) so for that lack of creativity i deduct a star! Buy this flippin thing if you havent done so already and give it plenty listenings!
0684824906|4.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has done a very nice job putting you in a time that most of us are unfamiliar.  If you think we have problems now, read this book, and what we're going through as a country feels like a walk in the park.  <br /> <br />The author has done a particularly good job of capturing who the people that would serve Lincoln are.  It would have been easy to write about Lincoln himself, but with whom he decided to surround himself tells us much more about the man.  In doing so, Goodwin has written the backstories of all the major players:  their roots, their wives, important friendships and associations, and most importantly, their egoes.  It's hard to imagine assembling these people together and getting them on the same page.  In showing us the depths of these people, Goodwin has shown us why Lincoln should be remembered as a great man and a great President. <br /> <br />A must read!
074322454X|4.0|I've read a number of history books, but this was the first one regarding World War II (WWII). I have seen a number of documentaries regarding WWII and never had a desire to read anything on the period of time. Some of my reading has focused on other wars, including the US Civil, WWI, and the US Revolutionary wars. I caught a few of the episodes of the Hank/Spielberg mini series and was captivated and had to learn more. <br /> <br />The book was very good. I enjoyed the depth of some of the characters and the details of the ordeals that they went through. It opened my eyes to a generation of heroes that should not be forgotten. I haven't read enough of Ambrose's work to comment of whether he idolizes the WWII veterns. I don't know if idolizing these people is correct, but I do think idolizing the accomplishments is justified. These people joined the military and rose to the occasion in ways that were above what was expected. I'm not sure if something like this could happen again, and I hope that events do not ever make it neccessary to ask.
B00000JCB3|3.0|i have but one thing (maybe two) to say. first: how dare you, Katherine Turman! how *DARE* you compare this lowly peasant-like \\"rap\\" rock band to the surrealistic, Godlike Tool. i agree that Don't Go Off Wandering is a pretty good song(especially by Limp Bizkit's standards.) but i can not. and will not! tolerate *ANYONE* comparing LB to Tool. it's like comparing a candle flame (Limp Bizkit) to the *freakin'* sun (Tool). with that being said i personally think that LB started out strong with Three Dollar Bill Y'all. i think that's an excellent cd with highlights such as Counterfeit, Stuck, Sink Finger, and Everything: an incredible 16 and a half minute auditory onslaught. but they plunged severely with Significant Other. there are a few exceptions. like Nobody Like You and A Lesson Learned, plus a few others. but most of the songs on this cd i cannot stand. and i refuse to listen to any of their work after this mediocre excuse for an album. but even so Three Dollar Bill Y'all remains, to this day, one of my favorite cds. it's too bad they didn't stick with the harder, more melodic style. otherwise i'd probably still be a fan.
B00005JMUL|5.0|A really well done film, bringing to kids a lot of joy, many of them imaging that they were in the same position like one of kids travelling with the Polar Express, and in many of them borning the Light of Christmas * A very special moment of the year * The Hero Boy it's a strong example for all of us who do not have the Spirit of Christmas, having the impresion that Christmas it's fake, and something not really important - in fact it's really important because many people make up, and many remember the one's who real are close to us; The Hero Boy saw the sleigh and the elves and the reindeers, and last Santa, but he still didn't hear the sleigh bell - so he \\"waked up\\" and believed - a very emotive part.As he believed, in us waked up the Christmas Spirit, with light and jpy like in the kids who believe stronger than us, being an example for all of us.  <br />Even if Christmas pased i wish u all the traditional Merry Christmas and also wish u to not lose ur faith for better
0743424425|5.0|Finishing and putting this book away was the hardest thing for me to do. The book is written with details so clearly it's as though you're there. The overall story is unforgettable and suspenseful; it is about a recovering alcoholic name Jack Torrance who's family is in need of money. It is because of this desperation that he finds a job as a caretaker for the Overlook Hotel, a hotel closed during the winter due to the snow. So he takes his wife, Wendy, and his son, Danny (who is blessed with the Shining; a gift of precognition) to live inside the hotel for the winter as he performs his task. And the winter they spend in there is a horrifying one; Danny begins to see the ghosts of the hotel's horrid past, and the hotel is starting to work over Jack as he slowly becomes more and more desperate for a drink. The hotel wants Danny's power, needing Jack to kill him and his mother to do so. It works over him slowly, bringing him to insanity. <br />I enjoyed every page of this story and finished it very quickly. I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys chilling and suspenseful tales. <br />
B0001HAISG|3.0|Actually, my rating for the movie is 5 stars, but for the sound it's ONE star: <br /> <br />I was impressed with the movie - Jeremy Sumpter is an absolutely PERFECT Peter Pan - just a little dickens of a \\"lady-killer\\", devilish sweet smile - but NOT with the SOUND.  The sound engineers, or SOMEONE, messed with it.  When it started to be loud - the music to show excitement - THEY (the sound engineers, or SOMEONE) TURNED IT DOWN.  Same with any yelling (excitement), by the children, the pirates, or Hook. <br /> <br />VERY disappointing!  I'LL control my sound thank-you-very-much! <br /> <br />I will be trying the Full Screen, & if necessary the VHS version, to see if it's only in the DVD widescreen.
B00080ZG10|4.0|Martin Scorsese's grand, 2004 epic \\"The Aviator\\" is a beautifully-crafted, exquisitely-detailed account of billionaire playboy Howard Hughes' earlier life, specifically, the era of his greatest triumphs (circa 1922 - 1947). Outstanding attention is paid to period-details, from the glamorous fashions worn by the starlets, to the boxy, square-shouldered suits popular at the time for men. Also quite convincing are the recreated scenes of a 1920s-1940s era Hollywood and California in general. The excellently-rendered scenes of the world premier of \\"Hell's Angels\\" on Hollywood Blvd. in 1929 and the crash of Hughes' futuristic XF11 spyplane in 1940s Beverly Hills are noteable for their realism and ability to draw the viewer in and make him or her \\"feel they are there.\\" <br /> <br />One minor gripe a viewer might have about this film is that he or she might fall into the game of \\"spot the star\\" because there are so many recognizable superstars in this film (No Doubt's Gwen Stefani as tragic starlet Gene Harlow, Jude Law as 1930s cinema pretty boy Errol Flynn, Alec Baldwin as Pan Am president Juan Tripp, Kate Beckinsale as sultry screen goddess Ava Gardner, Cate Blanchett as \\"box office poison\\" Kate Hepburn, ad nauseum). While each of the recognizable stars plays his or her role more or less with acceptable skill, seeing so many modern celebrities portraying celebrities who are long-dead consistently reminds the viewer that this is a film and \\"wrecks the magic.\\" Perhaps the major roles that had gone to well-known celebrities (Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes, Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn, Alec Baldwin as Juan Tripp) should have been retained, but Scorsese could have cut down on the celebrity cameos a little bit and allowed his viewers to be drawn into his film with fewer distractions. <br /> <br />This movie focuses mostly on Hughes' more youthful years, and the paranoia and obsessive compulsive tendencies with which he became engulfed in his later years are a smaller tangentof the movie. <br /> <br />Major plot points include: <br /> <br />- Hughes' torrid relationship with Katherine Hepburn <br />- Hughes' battles as TWA majority shareholder to gain intercontinental travel routes and his subsequent locking of horns with Pan Am and its president, Juan Trip <br />- the scandals occurring between Hughes and the U.S. government regarding alleged misappropriation of funds by Hughes Aircraft, inc. during WW2 <br />- Hughes' steady deterioration with regards to his compulsive disorders (fear of shaking hands, wearing footwear other than tennis shoes, urinating in jars, etcetera) <br />- Hughes' determination to make movies outside of the highly exclusive Hollywood studio system <br />- Hughes' genius as a progressive engineer in aerdynamics and aircraft design <br />- the saga of the \\"Spruce Goose\\" (nee H3K Hercules) <br /> <br />Things about Hughes not really dealt with in the film <br /> <br />- Hughes' total disintegration later in life <br />- Hughes' marriage to his childhood sweetheart that lasted from 1925-1929 <br />- Hughes' playboy party lifestyle in the 1920s and 1930s (there are a couple of scenes, but not really enough to convince the casual viewer who's never heard of Howard Hughes that he is a partying dillitante) <br />- Hughes' reputed homosexual relationships and bisexuality in general, which have been independently corroborrated by many who knew him, including Kate Hepburn <br /> <br />Overall, I give this film an A but not an A+ because certain aspects of Hughes' life aren't addressed, but it is understandable since there are only so many things a director can cover in under three hours. <br /> <br />\\"The Aviator\\" may not be the complete story of Howard Hughes, but it succeeds in making the average viewer want to know more about this fascinating aviation pioneer's life. <br /> <br />
B000021YQV|5.0|I had heard chopsuey in a pub and fell for it instantly. Incidentally i bought this album through you guys last month after going through some of ur reviews.  I decided to buy it just for this number, but when i listened to the whole thing, i was kind of spellbound....absolutely awesome stuff.  I,ve been a crazy fan of linkin park for the past five years, but after listening to this one i would certainly add this band to my list of alltime favorites.  so SOAD keep up the good work.
B000A3OS14|4.0|I saw this, and bought it on a whim.  I popped it in for the ride home, and WOW!  I almost had to pull over to have a martini!<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go\\" is stellar.  It's hard to believe this was ever anything but a jazz tune -- I love the Clash version, but this just SOUNDS jazz!  A couple other tracks are also spectacular, making the CD well worth it.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps it from being a 5-star (which to me means flawless), in my opinion, is that a couple tracks aren't as good.  I'm sorry, but \\"Like A Virgin\\" sounded too familiar, too much Madonna was still there.  Other tracks were okay, but most are very good.  (\\"In The Air Tonight\\" and \\"Sweet Dreams Are Made of This\\" are some other 5-star tracks, sounding like they've always been jazz tunes!)<br /><br />All in all, a great CD.  I'll be playing this at my next cocktail party!
B0006ZE7G2|4.0|the album fairs better than the movie. the movie plays like an extended MTV vidio.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Any album that entertains me with good songs deserves 5 stars. If you give the album a chance....it has good stuff on it.Korn have been around since 1994. This is 2006...there sound is going to change. No band sounds the same after that many years and it shouldn't !! Korn rocked then and they rock now.Korn is trying to stay viable in an ever changing market. This album has not left my player since I bought it. Give it a real chance. You may like it. My favorites are Getting Off,Hypocrites,Politics, Liar, Twisted Transistor and Love Song (probably the best song on the album ). Children of the Korn....enjoy
B000BW7QWW|5.0|For those of you who never saw the short lived television show 'Firefly', this film might make you think \\"it's just one of those TV movie deals that only people who liked or saw the show will enjoy\\".  You would be dead wrong.  Even if you never saw the show, it's easily understood, and odds are, after you see the movie, you'll be ordering up the DVD series of the show.  There are hundreds of positive reviews on the film, most by fans of the show, many however, by people who gave the movie a chance and came away very surprised.  Do the same.<br /><br />  If for anything, to show the studios, that cancelling something that only a small portion of people really truly loved (dare I say, moreso than ANY other TV show in history) cannot truly kill it.  Other TV shows have had bigger legions of fans...none have had more devoted and loving ones.  And after viewing the film, you can see why.  I can think of no show or movie that got treated the way it did, and yet triumphs in the hearts of thousands of people as the end all be all of great storytelling.
B000003T9B|5.0|Overkill is one of those underrated thrash bands who never got to see the spotlight of stardom as such acts as Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax and even Exodus.  In my opinion, this is a good album.  However, I wouldn't go as far as saying that it is one of the best.  The metal they played was no different than that of Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax.  The songs are mostly good.  I would, nevertheless, recommend this album to any metalhead.
B000063JDE|5.0|David Lynch's fever-dream Blue Velvet stands as an important cinematic work.  Told with innocence and visual poetry, the film brings us into a realm of darkness and light, perversion and love.  Although the film may be too disturbing or bizarre for some, it radiates with undeniable compassion.  I do not want to reveal too much about the story or the movie itself, because it's truly an experience.  However, I must say that the way in which Lynch delivers the final payoff through the film's ending is masterful. <br /> <br />This Special Edition DVD contains many interesting features, a number of which are hidden and must be found using the arrows on your remote control.  It should be noted, however, that the \\"deleted scenes\\" feature is actually a montage of still photographs.  Also, the \\"Mysteries of Love\\" documentary--although very informative--does not delve too deep into the film's meaning.  In fact, if one wants an interesting documentary that reveals some interesting info on David Lynch, I recommend checking out the documentaries on the Special Edition DVD of Twin Peaks. <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this DVD, especially to lovers of cinema.
B000BP86OG|5.0|This left me speechless and that is hard to do.  It has been years since something so perfectly executed musically and artistically has been able to make me listen, sit back, feel and go WOW!  I am 40 and have been blessed to live and SURVIVE the late 70' and 80's.  I love bands like Queen, ELO,Styx,Journey, TRiumph, Zeppelin..ya know what I mean???? Blazing harmonies...production, production, the vocals, whew! (Freddie would be so proud of this piece...the last 3 tracks were unreal....this showcased the vocals like no other.)  Although I was a fan from the debut, and people laughed and said the Darkness?  And I said, \\"no you don't understand, I play, sing and these guys ARE talented, you wait, they are going to explode\\", I have picked winners, I saw JET when they couln't give tickets away, The Foo Fighters when they played a small little venues and now THIS PERFECT ALBUM----YES, GAVE ME THAT FEELING OF LED ZEPPELIN 4!!!!  Orgasmically perfect in every way<br /><br />BUY THIS AND WATCH OUT, THE BEST IS YET TO COME FROM JUSTIN AND THE BOYS. THIS BAND IS HOT, THEY ARE YOUNG AND TALENTED ....<br /><br />JOYSTYX KNOWS.....THANK YOU TO THE DARKNESS FOR REMINDING MY SOUL TO ROCK!
B00004STPT|5.0|The greatness of Ridley Scott's Gladiator is due in large part to its moving, nuanced, and haunting score by Hans Zimmer.  The lush orchestrations, ominous tones, and ultimately resonant sonance of every track make Gladiator one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.  The track \\"Sorrow\\" is so very elegiac, whereas the last three tracks have a heavenly, inspiring quality that I have rarely heard in film music.  Lisa Gerrard's vocals are like those of a siren's.  To say the very least, this is a superb, rousing score.  Highly recommended.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|Mariah Carey regained her crown with this album. She truly does deserve the 8 Grammy Nominations. People need to stop comparing people. I read a review for Mary J. Blige's \\"The Breakthrough\\", which is also an amazing album. The reviewer said \\"use The Emancipation Of Mimi as a coaster and get The Breakthrough\\". Is it not possible to have more than one amazing album released in one year. Both of these two women are amazing and both of them released amazing albums. Also, I read something about Mariah Carey fans trying to make Madonna's album flop, which is ridiculous. People always have to compare people. But anyways, back to this album. With this album, you can tell Mariah is in a new place and she's finally free. The title fits very well for the album, because it just sounds like she just let go of everything. The music doesn't like it's being controlled, there's just this strong feel of freedom.  <br /> <br />The album jumps off with the first single, \\"It's Like That\\". This free-spirited party-starter is produced by Jermaine Dupri and Mariah Carey. I love the song, but the first verse is definately very shocking to all the long-term Mariah fans, as she makes drug and alcohol references (\\"I came to have a party, open up the Bacardi....Purple taking me higher, I'm lifted and I\\" like it). But regardless, the song is still amazing. The second track on the album is the second single, \\"We Belong Together\\", which is also produced by Jermaine Dupri and Mariah Carey. The song is her first number one hit in over five years, and it's an absolutely amazing song. Mariah Carey describes the song as \\"Anytime You Need A Friend\\" meets \\"Breakdown\\", and Jermaine Dupri describes it as the biggest song of his career. Although I may have heard this song over a million times, since April of 2005, surpringsly, I have never gotten sick of yet. The next track on the album is the third single \\"Shake It Off\\", also produced by Jermaine Dupri and Mariah Carey. Jermaine Dupri and Mariah Carey definately make the perfect team. Dupri has been each single released from this album so far. This is one of my favorites on the album, the lyrics are awesome. It's just about move on and putting someone behind you and just \\"shaking them off\\". Great lyrics! The fourth song on the album is a beautiful ballad called \\"Mine Again\\", produced by James Poyser and Mariah Carey. It's an absolutely amazing song that shows you MARIAH STILL HAS THAT AMAZING VOICE. ALthough this song has not been released as a single, I have heard on the radio in Chicago a few times. The next song on the album is a Neptunes-produced track featuring Snoop Dogg, called \\"Say Somethin'.\\" Mariah Carey and Snoop Dogg colloborated back in 1999 on the song \\"Crybaby.\\" This song definately isn't as great as \\"Crybaby\\" but it's still a pretty good song. The next song is a track produced by Kanye West and Mariah which is another one of my favorites. I have so many favorites on this album that it's ridiculous, I can't even pic a number one favorite. But this is definately one of my favorites. A great colloboration between Mariah and Kanye. Mariah's voice is amazing on this album and again, it's one of those song that just gives you that FREE feeling. Guess what's next, another favorite. \\"Get Your Number\\" is another colloboration with Jermaine Dupri, which was a top ten hit in the U.K. For some odd reason, people keep refering to this as one of the worst tracks on the album, but I think it's one of the best on the album. It has a very early '90's feel to it. It's kind of like, what Mariah Carey would do in the early 1990's if she teamed up with Jermaine Dupri earlier. The next track is a song called \\"One & Only\\" which features Twista. I think the song might be better without Twista singing along with the melody several times in the middle of his rap, and just had a short rap, instead of the long verse he has. The next song is a ballad called \\"Circles\\" in which she produces with James \\"Big Jim\\" Wright. It's just agreat song with great lyrics. The next song is a more upbeat song called \\"Your Girl\\". I can't think of anything to say about it, but it's just a really good song. The next song is a slower track called \\"I Wish You Knew\\", the song has a fake live audience at the beginning of it. The song has an old school R&B ballad feel to it. It's a really nice song. Things change up a bit with the next track. Another track produced by The Neptunes called \\"To The Floor\\", featuring Nelly. The song is definately a club joint, but definately has an 80's feel to it. This is another one of my favorites. We already knew Nelly and The Neptunes made a good team due to the success of \\"Hot In Herre\\". But I also think Mariah and Nelly sound good together. The next song, \\"Joy Ride\\", I think might be my least favorite on the album. I just don't think there's anything all that special about it. The final track on the original pressing of the album is \\"Fly Like A Bird\\", which is a wonderful song. I love this song because it's like she's going back to the basics. Towards the end of the song a choir comes in singing the chorus. It reminds you of something she would have done in the early or mid 90's. <br /> <br />The new re-released edition of the album features four new bonus tracks, \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", \\"Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do)\\", \\"So Lonely (One & Only Part II)\\" and \\"We Belong Together Remix\\". All four tracks are amazing, making the album ten times better. \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is Mariah's latest single, produced by Jermaine Dupri and herself, like her other singles released the album. I love this song, it's reminiscent of \\"Always Be My Baby\\", which was also produced by Jermaine Dupri and Mariah, and was the first collobroation between the two. \\"Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do)\\" is another Jermaine Dupri/Mariah colloboration and is absolutely amazing. It's basically just a very sexy upbeat Hip-Hop flavored track. \\"So Lonely (One & Only Part II)\\" is 90 billion times better than the original version. I don't even like the original version all that much (compared to the other tracks on the album), but I think this song might have to be my favorite track on the album. The album closes with the \\"We Belong Together\\" remix featuring Jadakiss and Styles P. This remix has been getting airplay ever since the summer of 2005, so it's good to finally get it on an album. I don't think I love it as much as the original version but I still love it, and I'm so glad they put it on here. If you don't have this re-released version, stop complaining and GO GET IT! You can sell the original pressing to a used CD store! The four new tracks alone are definately worth the money.  <br /> <br />\\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" is Mariah Carey's best album since... I don't know, since all of her album's are amazing. But this album is definately way better than \\"Charmbracelet\\". Mariah Carey definately deserves these 8 Grammy Nominations. She HAS regained her crown!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|\\"Science Fiction\\" in this case meaning guys in spaceships.<br /><br />This film is probably the best I have seen since Lord of the Rings, and I've a feeling that it will be the best I see for many years.  The dialogue between characters is sometimes unsophisticated, but always amusing.  The action is excellent.  The villains are frightening and the heroes are the most entertaining set of rogues since The Matrix.  The underlying theme of freedom is one I identify with very strongly, and despite the film's setting of outer space, the crew of the good ship Serenity is a distinctly-American group of lone warriors.  This is an oft-explored concept to be sure, but Serenity does it with a perfectly conceived balance of poise and guts.<br /><br />I'm a Trekkie, but this kicks the hell out of Star Trek.  It damn near unseats the Star Wars films too, and on some days, I am convinced  it is better than them.  Simply put, this film has given me hope for the soul of American entertainment.<br /><br />This is the second review I have ever written, the first being a review of ths original TV show, Firefly.  I strongly urge you to buy this DVD--it is absolutely worth the purchase.  I am purchasing this film not because I wish to own it (I can burn a copy if I care to), but to contribute in my meager way to the making of another film, and hopefully, more TV shows.

I love this song, it's reminiscent of \\"Always Be My Baby\\", which was also produced by Jermaine Dupri and Mariah, and was the first collobroation between the two. \\"Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do)\\" is another Jermaine Dupri/Mariah colloboration and is absolutely amazing. It's basically just a very sexy upbeat Hip-Hop flavored track. \\"So Lonely (One & Only Part II)\\" is 90 billion times better than the original version. I don't even like the original version all that much (compared to the other tracks on the album), but I think this song might have to be my favorite track on the album. The album closes with the \\"We Belong Together\\" remix featuring Jadakiss and Styles P. This remix has been getting airplay ever since the summer of 2005, so it's good to finally get it on an album. I don't think I love it as much as the original version but I still love it, and I'm so glad they put it on here. If you don't have this re-released version, stop complaining and GO GET IT! You can sell the original pressing to a used CD store! The four new tracks alone are definately worth the money.  <br /> <br />\\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" is Mariah Carey's best album since... I don't know, since all of her album's are amazing. But this album is definately way better than \\"Charmbracelet\\". Mariah Carey definately deserves these 8 Grammy Nominations. She HAS regained her crown!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really don't like TV, but I would strongly urge you to buy this set.  I am a pianist and a classical music buff, so television shows have always struck me as a waste of time.  Firefly, however, is another matter entirely.  I can add little to what the other reviewers have said, stating only that this TV show has given me slight hope for the dying soul of American entertainment.  It's a direct descendant of 50's westerns, coupled with a generous helping of Star Wars and just a pinch of Cowboy Bebop (the only example of Japanese television I can stand).<br /><br />I am, in fact, taking the time to buy the DVD set of Firefly not just to own it (I already have burned copies) but to contribute in some meager way to the production of more episodes and films.<br /><br />This is the first review I have ever written.  I intend to write my second and only other review as soon as I am done with this one--a review of the film Serenity.
2070360024|5.0|Je fais mon debut comme instite a un lycee.  Pour le cours de francais V, on va commencer la litterature avec L'ETRANGER de Camus.  Je crois que c'est l'endroit ideal pour commencer, car le livre se presente simplement au lecture, mais le mene aux themes importants de la philosophie francaise/absurdiste.  A mon avis personnel, la scene du meurtre sur la plage est exceptionnellement emouvante et vive.  Ceux qui disent que c'est n'importe quoi comme livre completement ratent un chef-d'oeuvre.
B000067IZ3|4.0|Get ready for a much more serious film on drug addiction (if your goin for the not-so-serious movie check out Spun or Trainspotting). The message delivered in this film is quite powerful...to say so the least. The War on Drugs is such a controversial topic- and this movie explored many sides of it. In one scenario it ruins a family; only to bring them all together in the end. In another scenario another family is destroyed- and in the end their family is muddled with lies and even more destruction. And in similar two other scenarios one friend looses another due to the nastiness of the drug business- where you are subject to everything, especially murder.   <br /> <br />Why four stars instead of five? Too many plots thrown together- for one thing. You have to see this movie a good 2-3 times to fully understand and get what is going on with everyone and their own separate scenarios. Another thing I find confusing is the overall general message this film is trying to say...what is it? Or is there no general message- just that the war on drugs is quite complex and quite intricate... therefore there are both good and bad aspects? If so, I already knew that.  <br /> <br />I do believe everyone should see this movie however, it gives interesting thought to a very complex issue- that I am sure everyone has an opinion on.  <br />
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I am 17 and I must say this is easily the most fully realized album of my generation, more so than \\"Get Behind Me Satan\\" or \\"Late Registration.\\" What the Strokes have created is a masterpiece, what some may see as machinelike is really a well thought out album everysong genius. I can honestly say that this is personally what I have been looking for for the last 6 years, to be able bring an album home and not have one drop of dissapointment. Songs like \\"Juicebox\\" and \\"Razorblade\\" and \\"15 Minutes\\" make me quiver, and unlike Coldplay the Strokes have tempered with they're sound for the better. Yes they sound big and at times even sleek but in such a good way that my only point of refrence is of the albums of old like \\"Exile on Mainstreet\\" and \\"Born to Run\\". Now before I'm brutally attacked let me say that back then it was relatively ok to have a big and sleek sound to be \\"commercial\\" I guess; but isn't that alright? Who cares if they've moved away from their New York basement sound they've progressed and are standing out. <br />   Their sound is to hard to describe other than just plain good every song, every lyric. We can see the talent of Hammond and Valensi thats been hiding in the minimalism of the past popping out some times on tracks like \\"soma.\\" \\"Ask me anything\\" is synth magic and \\"You only live once\\" and \\"On the Other Side\\" are extremely clever. I don't know how to sum this up other than do anything in your power to obtain this album, and yes the liner notes are worth it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'll start by saying, im not a sci-fi fan by any stretch of the word, but somehow this movie just worked on so many levels for me. I enjoyed the captain's wit, and the whole experience of the crew, much better then any of the new Star Wars movies for me...
1593072937|4.0|Sin City: The Hard Goodbye comes packed with the new version of Sin City, and truthfully, it wasn't really needed. The movie follows the book so well that it feels as if you're watching the movie over again as you read. Frank Miller did a hell of a job in this aspect at keeping the movie as true to the book as possible, with Robert Rodriguez's help, of course.<br /><br />(Possible Spoiler) Mostly everybody who is a fan of Sin City would say that Marv is their favorite character, or at least his story is the best. The graphic novel contains a lot of controversy, with the killing of priests, plenty of nudity, and a load of gore and violence, and it comes off darkly from the pages with Frank Miller's unique, film noir style for this book. You can feel the anger of Marv as he goes from kill to kill, and slowly you start to sense just how gone his mind is from his head. Still, he becomes lovable and somewhat altruistic in his quest for revenge because of a couple of redeeming qualities, that being he never hurts women, and he's willing to die for a cause he believes in. The end, though inevitable, is not disappointing, as you would think a monster like him, who has yet to find his place in this world, would be better off gone.<br /><br />The setting of this book, Sin City, seems to be a dark mixture of New York City and a third world country. The dead or the fallen litter the streets, and only the strongest or richest survive. The only ones capable of any good are usually the worst of the bunch, including Marv. And more often than not, those moments of good turn into something entirely evil, a common aspect in all of the Sin City graphic novels.<br /><br />The Sin City movie, though true to the graphic novels, left out a lot of stories, so, if you saw the movie, I'd first recommend buying all the books that were missing from the movie, and then complete your collection with The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard later. But definately complete your collection, as this is a classic series sure to be around for a while (it's already been thirteen years since their first print.our collection, as this is a classic series sure to be around for a while (it's already been thirteen years since their first print.
B000002UEB|4.0|For those of you that haven't heard, Queensryche is coming out with Operation: Mindcrime II sometime this year.  If you caught them live recently, this would explain the \\"2nd-half\\" of the show.  Something to remind you of what's coming!  If you didn't catch the show and don't yet have this album or DVD, then I suggest you get on the ball before the new album hits.  After all, you don't want to be left out in the cold staring into \\"The Eyes Of A Stranger\\", do you?
B000AP04EW|4.0|To start, I have to say I'm not much of a fan of either Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie. The only Pitt movies I liked were \\"Fight Club\\" and, because I'm a nerd for ancient history and mythology, Troy. Angelina is, on the other hand, notoriously bad at finding good movies to act in. The only movie I like, and this is self-explanatory, is Taking Lives. So, needless to say, I was skeptical of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. This was not even a purchase I made, but one of a family members. If not for Christmas, I wouldn't have touched this movie.<br /><br />Well, thank you Santa. Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a surprisingly funny and action-packed movie. The movie never goes out of its way to force laughs, but kind of just lets it happen through implication and dry humor. The action itself, though it's very difficult to make an action movie in today's saturated market, is done with freshness, with car-chases and gun-fights and explosions galore. Nowhere is the action and comedy better than when Pitt and Jolie are together. It makes for some classic stuff.<br /><br />The story, if you don't already know, is of a married couple who are assassins-for-hire, though neither know that about each other in the beginning. They go about acting as a regular married couple, what with perfectly timed dinners, gettogethers with other couples, and those suburban vehicles. But on those occasions when a job comes, they are as proficient as killers could be, and go about their job professionally and with enough time to get back for dinner. Things twist, however, when they finally discover each others secret, and they must eliminate each other or else suffer elimination themselves.<br /><br />Like I said before, I'm not fond of either actor, but I am convinced that this movie couldn't have been done without these two. Pitt plays that same cool character he does in most of his movies, but it works here with the comedy as it kind of balances him out, makes him a bit more real. Angelina plays the tough-chick like no other high-powered actress (if you don't believe, try picturing Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, or Renee Zellweger in her spot).<br /><br />If you liked True Lies, this is a movie for you. If you like solid action (like what's in Desperado or Kill Bill), then I'd also recommend this movie for you. Also, if you are fans of Pitt or Jolie, as I'm slowly becoming, then go with Mr. and Mrs. Smith, because it is one of the finest movies, I think, either of them played a part in.ike no other high-powered actress (if you don't believe, try picturing Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, or Renee Zellweger in her spot). <br /> <br />If you liked True Lies, this is a movie for you.

B00005JMEW|4.0|Quentin Tarantino is a strange boy. He has never made a straight ahead film, and maybe never will. I'm not saying he should, but his movies are always more than you'd expect, and things aren't fully explained for a long time. There's always some twisted plots to figure out, or numbers of flashbacks.  <br /> <br />Giving style to movies is what Tarantino does best. His work reminds me of someone who is in the music business: someone who's a novice musician and writer, but incredible at producing the style that would make a stunning album.  <br /> <br />Kill Bill is a 'hip' tale about revenge, as the members of \\"The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad\\" (wow, I'll try to avoid any encounters with groups that have that kind of name) are about to regret the attempt they made on the life of a reformed member. She is known throughout the film as 'The Bride' (Uma Thurman). An opening close up scene has her face all bloodied up, while approaching footsteps make their way to her. It's Bill, leader of the gang, and as he sarcastically asks her some questions, she tries to answer, but he interrupts her with a gunshot to the head. Unseen here, but explained later in the film, is that 'The Bride', pregnant and engaged, was about to rehearse her wedding with her fiance and friends. Her former team mates show up at her wedding well armed, and slaughter everyone in the church. The wedding was the start of her life as a new person, and Bill, her former lover and boss, made a jealous move.  <br /> <br />Four years later, she is surprisingly alive, but in a coma in some hospital. Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is one of the members of the 'Deadly Viper Assassination Squad' (I just had to say that striking name again), and decides to pay The Bride a visit with some lethal poison to finish her off, only to be stopped by Bill via cell phone. He suggests that they will get her another day, in an honorable fashion. This kill would have been like a cheap shot. Elle gets all sucky and mad, but evenshe has some honour. Otherwise, she'd press 'end call' on Bill, and finish the job.  <br /> <br />When Thurman is alone again, she snaps out of the coma, and after bowling over a pair of coma victim seeking perverts, wheelchairs herself to the parking garage, finds a crudely named getaway vehicle, and does some self help physiotherapy on her immobile limbs.  <br /> <br />Quentin Tarantino gives you a variety of styles that make this a treat to watch: occasional black and white shots (and the right shots too), anime' (a very violent short story about O-Ren Ishii's tragic childhood that brought her to where her way of life is now), and music that's the epitome of cool (I love the 5,6,7,8's \\"Woo Hoo\\"). Vivica A. Fox, my favourite 'Viper', plays the second on the Bride's death list, Vernita Green (or Copperhead) and their fight was the most brutal of all the fights from the whole story, although this big scene comes to us first. See, the director once again doesn't just go from one to the next. It's back and forth: here, and then back up to there. O-Ren and The Bride's showdown is seen last in Vol. 1, but their fight actually was the first. That's Tarantino's style.  <br /> <br />Aside from plots of revenge and violence, it's also very funny. There's bickering between two men who run an old tea/sushi bar, and one of them is secretly a sword maker, who reluctantly comes out of retirement to create his finest sword yet for our heroine. Also, one balding server at O-Ren's favourite hangout is referred to as 'Charlie Brown' by her henchmen, and the overly serious O-Ren, who's now a crime lord, actually laughs at that reference. There's plenty of camp, and each slice of it is placed right where it should be, from cliche's, to references of other films, etc. There are some really corny scenes that pay homage to all those cheesy low-budget action movies Tarantino loves, like the jet plane that The Bride takes to Japan. It's clearly a model plane, and it flies/bobs like a toy prop you would see in a old low budget action flick. It gives you some laughs and relief from the tense yet sly pacing. Tarantino moves the movie around like a black cat, sneaking around for that big rat it's looking for. The 'big' pounce is coming, but there's a few other rats it needs to take care of first. Where does the film go as far as story? Well, the story isn't really much. It's more about the intentions and actions of revenge. This film is plenty entertaining, funny, and styled to the max, that the B-movie story (well, B+) is acceptable.  <br /> <br />Mark my words: this film is filled with plenty of blood and chopped limbs, especially when Thurman, alone, goes head to head with the \\"Crazy 88\\", O-Ren's army of watered down ninja's, as well as the much better skilled young Gogo Yubari, who is a sadistic teen girl that likes to kill (remember, don't let teens or kids see this flick-it's really a bad example). You'll probably laugh at the cartoonish lopping of some heads and arms, but after a good twenty dead or maimed bodies, it becomes really ridiculous and turns into a bloodbath.  <br /> <br />Uma Thurman, who's sincere in the role of this vengeful woman, was meant to play this role (it was written for her specifically), and goes well beyond some very impressive skills with a sword and martial art moves. The Bride wants blood, and although she gets some, her character is wise enough not to run into situations with her sword flailing and shouting \\"hiiiii-yaaaaa!\\". Her character's control is a relief. The Bride is smart, cunning, skilled, patient, and focused, even though her anger is hot. She also has a pain that grows deep inside of her. Her loss is great, and this volume is not enough for her. Hence Volume 2.  <br /> <br />We all have to try and remember: Vol 1 and 2 are not separate movies, but merely one film cut in two parts so we could wait in anticipation for the other volume, and for Tarantino to make some double moola. Smart marketing. I didn't mindpaying twice, and I didn't mind waiting. Both volumes were really worth it.  <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon actually alludes to this idea in the extras on the DVD, but this is how I described the show and movie to friends when the movie first came out. If you're a sci-fi fan of \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Star Trek\\" and also like the appeal of character development and growth of the characters in \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" this is a fantastic show to watch. Captain Mal is the stubborn and smart-alicky type guy one can admire, love, need to punch from time to time, and want to understand better. Wouldn't everyone like to know more about Inara, and I'd sure like to have learned more about Shepherd Book's past. Whedon has a great talent for humor and detailed storytelling. It's too bad we'll probably never see more of this wonderful crew...
B000BYRCH4|3.0|this film is not amazing. its not a spectacular adventure about treasure hunting and drug busts. its a summer action flick. its 'the national treasure' but with less clothing and more water. its like watching fire works go off for an hour and a half. its fun to watch and great entertainment, just not something you want to keep in your dvd collection as a classic. fun flick though.
B000BVD460|4.0|When Eminem first appeared on the scene and, later, made it big, I honestly couldn't stand him. To me, he was irritating, an idiot, and one of lousiest acts in history. I've got to say, though, that over the years, Eminem has produced, with all respect to Dr. Dre, some of the catchiest beats and rhymes of recent years.     Curtain Call covers the period between 1999 and 2005, and the four albums that he has put out as of now. The compilation includes the breakthrough hits My Name Is and the Dr Dre duet Guilty Conscience (both from 1999's The Slim Shady LP), the chart breaking The Real Slim Shady, the vicious The Way I Am, and the original Stan (all from 2000's multi-platinum selling The Marshall Mathers LP), the hilarious Without Me, and the dark Cleaning Out My Closet (both from 2002's The Eminem Show), the sweet lullaby Mockingbird, and the bizarre Just Lose It (both from 2004's Encore), and the Oscar winning Lose Yourself, from Eminem's breakthrough movie 8 Mile, is also featured. The album also features the new single When I'm Gone, an excellent spine-tingling tune that follows up Mockingbird as a song written about Eminem's daughter Hailie, and his struggle with insomnia and frustration during his most recent tour.    The collection, however, misses some extraordinary tracks that should have been included like White America, Forgot About Dre (featured on Dr. Dre's album 2001), and Mosh, Eminem's 2004 Bush bashing song.     However, Curtain Call is still a consistent profile of one of the biggest rap sensations of all time, truth be told!    Recommended    B+

B000B8QF14|5.0|With the release of Bullet In A Bible, it has become recorded proof, both in picture and sound, that Green Day are one of the best live acts and greatest rock bands of all time.    Frontman Billie Jo Armstrong's energetic performance, along with Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool, has elevated the band of three to a level, not even they ever expected, of nostalgia, greatness, and rock royalty with the likes of bands such as Queen. Actually, Billie Jo's onstage antics, humor and performance is somewhat similar to Freddy Mercury's.    I was lucky enough to go watch Green Day at the Palace of Auburn Hills in Detroit on September 11, 2005. The show blew me away. Billie Jo kept the crowd on its feet and their hands in the air shouting, screaming, and singing along throughout the concert that lasted more than 2 hours. I have never been to a concert where I didn't get bored not even for a second, or get tired by the end of the show. This is evident on the recording as well. The song King For A Day, which appeared near the end of the set, which mixes into a medley featuring the song You Make Me Wanna Shout (the Detroit show also featured the classic Stand By Me), was one of the highlight moments, and the crowd were so into it, you can hear them shouting so hard and singing along...it's just too good to be true.    Bullet is a dual disc, one of which is the audio CD of the concert recorded in Milton Keynes, England, and the other is a visual/audio DVD of the same live show. What can I not say about it? It's remarkable to say the least. It was also very reminiscent of the Detroit show (the same exact lines that Billie Jo would say to the crowd, the crowd responses and sing alongs...etc.) so the band have got their act well figured out.     The concert begins with a string of songs from 2004's American Idiot: the title track American Idiot, Jesus Of Suburbia (featuring all 5 parts), Holiday, Are We The Waiting, and St Jimmy. The response of the crowd is astounding to each one of these numbers, it gets quite deafening if you have the volume all the way up. Green Day then play a set of their greatest hits including the songs, in no order, Basket Case and Longview from 1994's Dookie, Brain Stew and Jaded from 1995's Insomnia, Minority from 2000's Warning, and King For A Day and Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life) from 1997's Nimrod. American Idiot is revisited later on during the show with the hits Boulevard Of Broken Dreams and Wake Me Up When September Ends.    The DVD also features behind the scenes footage of the band discussing the songs and their worldwide mega success.    Recommended    A
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Seriously, where do they find these boring white chicks?  It obviously takes millions for a major label to shove another pop-punk chick down our throats, otherwise who the hell would even listen?    The Avril Recipe, if you will:    Preheat public to accept anything that claims to be punk rock, even when bought and paid for and pushed by X corporation.    1 adolescent girl, doesn't have to look all that great, just must be willing to sell out and mindlessly repeat the party line, able to occasionally write lyrics, but not enough to cut into the money train's existing payees    1 air guitar (or guitar case so they can look cool)---this should be the same guitar we never see them play on stage    1 gimmicky outfit or hair dye color, available at KMart for under $15    10 music industry songwriters and sanitizers, business consultants and the like    12+ session musicians, writers and studio hacks, paid well enough to doctor up the hits guaranteed to be promoted by the label    1 reservation on that harbinger of great music, TRL    Mix all ingredients (and remix for the dance market as well).  Add some spice to the girl's story, such as she's a real (suburban) badass, she's a \\"songwriter\\" and she \\"++HATES++ the people who signed her, so she must be okay, right?\\"    Shape into similar balls on plate.  Cover in sugar and other BS.    Then payola Clearchannel to the tune of $250K per song promoted.  Pay independent promoters and middle people to get the song played on those seminal stations like KROQ in LA.    After the song hits----SURF'S UP!!!---- put an article in the global newspapers saying that (name of artist) was found     1) with her pants down   2) at so-and-so's party in H'wood, drunk as a skunk  3) buying a house with a pool big enough to fit the White House in it (definitely have this shown on MTV for the bling-bling crowd)  4) having bitten a bouncer at a bar just to prove how big a badass she is (neglect to mention that her entourage protected her while inthe act)    Oh yeah, don't let her name be out of the papers too long in between albums.  Tell us all how she's getting married for the fourth time in two years, or something.  Or how she threw her boyfriend off the balcony into that huge pool, and how it served him right.  Anything for us rabid, foaming at the mouth fans of the corporate creation.    Please, record industry, recognize that the game is over. It's just an embarrassment to still be pushing crap like Lavigne.

B0000CAQ26|1.0|I thought Missundaztood was a pretty good piece of work for this 100,000th pop brat who's been forced on the public, but this album should have been called \\"Try Something Else\\"---it just doesn't cut it. Luckily for Pink (I don't know about the rest of us), she had a writer like Linda Perry on Missundaztood who knows how to put together a great pop song, otherwise we would probably have never heard from Pink again.     Even with all her rock posturing, I know for sure I am not going to \\"re-discover\\" punk through a mainstream entertainer who is spoonfed Hollywood songwriters to work with while sporting a cigarette rasp that barely approaches that of her so-called rock idols, including Perry and Joplin (please don't even go there: as far as Pink singing like the one and only Janis Joplin, forget it, try Joss Stone instead, at least she has a real rasp, and she's all soul, without trying so damn hard). I for one can't tell Pink apart from the 20 other slightly gravelly RnB-esque pop-rockers on the scene these days, but maybe that's the point: saturate the market with soundalikes, and three or four will fly, especially when they are posed as though in a perpetual catfight. Gone are the days when a label invested in something that stood on its own terms.     Adding to the chinks in her credibility armor, Pink's story mirrors label-mate Avril Lavigne's in far too many ways for either to be credible: both claim to be punk-rock, both claim to be \\"songwriters\\" when we know they are not, and both come from bland white suburbs where the only bad asses are in people's farmyards. Both \\"co-wrote\\" with 90s songwriter darlings (Pink with Linda Perry and Avril with Chantal Kraviazuk, whom both singers respectively and very suspiciously thought of as their new \\"moms\\"---gee, I wonder if the marketing department at Arista realized these two showed up wearing the same dress?). But, amazingly, \\"the people\\" still buy into these suit-sponsored packages, even when these little divas act outand \\"rebel\\" against their industrial handlers by \\"adding real rock guitars\\" into their mixes (now, if they would only play them). I am sure it all translates into higher record sales for their corporation, especially among 12-year olds, but hey, ya gotta grow up sometime.    Whatever she does, Pink needs to watch who she \\"co-writes\\" with. Her sound changes so drastically with each new writer that it's obvious her \\"muse\\" lacks a real identity. But that's ok, she had her hand on a bolt of lightning on Missundaztood (in spots, and only due to Perry), even though now it seems to have been passed on to Kelly Clarkson and the others in the same revenue channel. But for me (and a lot of others it seems) it's definitely time to change this channel.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This was by far the best movie of last year. It's amazing in every way. The cast was really good and the directing was great. It was also very violent and had a lot of hot women in it. Alexis Bledel and Jessica Alba both looked great in this film. I can't wait for the sequel.
B000002UJQ|5.0|A few months ago, Channel 4 hosted a program called 'The 100 Greatest Albums Of All Time.' And this month, Q magazine had an article called 'The 100 Greatest Albums Of All Time'. I would like to point out, to the horror of idiots like Mr. MTV who like their music mainstream and pedestrian, that OK Computer came 1st in both. (The Bends came second in Q Magazine, just to rub salt into a gaping wound). <br /> <br />This album is NOT pretentious, droll or boring. What it IS, is a genius creation unlike nothing you have ever heard. It's not for miserabalists or nerds, as i'm neither, and i enjoy it as much as most people on this forum, and unfortunately some people are to unintelligent to realise what music truly is. <br /> <br />OK Computer, as well as all the other albums (Pablo Honey was good! Honest!) prove that acts such as mainstream, predictable Coldplay have a long way to go before being called Greatest Act In The World without people who know about music  coughing up their drink. Until that day comes, Radiohead will have that crown, and long may they do so. <br /> <br />P.S. To truly appreciate Kid A and Amnesiac, burn them both onto iTunes, mold both albums together and create the genius follow up what Radiohead intended. Aren't i clever? <br /> <br />P.S.S. As a kick in the arse to people who say you have to be over 30 and a wrist-slitter to enjoy it, i'm 15 years old, have a girlfriend, a countless amount as friends and basically as happy as Thom Yorke is miserable. Every point imaginable proven, don't you agree?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What happened to the original thinkers in TV ? What happened to \\"Must see TV\\" ?  This series and subsequent movie are absolute proof that the creativity we have lost in Network TV is still out there, but is being quashed by Network Execs that are undeniably out of touch with its viewers. If the networks do find a series people want to watch they run it for a few months then kill production to run another series all together like its impossible to have two good shows at the same time on the same network or they find ONE good idea and run two more identical shows with only slightly diffrent names. Even Hollywood seems more than happy to churn out remake after remake of 50 year old movies. Don't get me wrong I enjoy watching giant apes swat airplanes, orange Dodge Chargers flying thru the air and the science it takes to lift a print from a glass as much as the next guy, but if they make it common practice to cancel shows with this much promise because they can't compete with a sports franchise or a show in its fifth year, 50 years from now they will STILL be remaking Giant Apes, orange Dodge Chargers and showing for the 10 millionth time that they can get dna with a cotton swab.  <br /> <br />I had not heard of the Firefly series until I heard about Serenity. I watched the series first then the movie and was glad I did. Since this is on dvd I highly suggest watching both the series and the movie. Serenity doesn't rely on Firefly but it does carry on where the series left off with just enough retold history to keep it self contained.
0062502182|4.0|So if you are a loyal member of the status quo, then by all means don't waste your resources to read this book.  It is not for you.  That category includes most who are vested in the Age of Reason, the Age of Materialism, peer reviewed scholasticism, and those abandoning their 'personal legend'.<br /><br />The book is properly characterized as a fable.  As such it will be full of alegorical reference and symbolism.  In this form it cannot reveal esoteric knowledge or insight, only hint at it. The simplistic style and plot is in keeping with the structure of a fable. If you want your truth as exposition, read non-fiction.<br /><br />What is commonly believed to be known about alchemists is mostly mythological.  True alchemy was spiritual, not material, and alchemists who sought transmutation were known negatively as \\"puffers\\". Alchemical  empirical knowledge was still being used as the foundation for chemistry in the eighteenth century. It was the commercialization of alchemy in the seventeenth century that largely ruined its reputation. As referred to by Coelho, the true alchemist was seeking to purify himself in parallel to his purification of the material elements. Every alchemist risked his life, his fortune, and his social standing to pursue the legend. Whether the character finds a tangible treasure or not, its constitution is purely symbolic!<br /><br />While adhering to the traditional goal of purification, Coelho also introduces elements of contemporary alchemy, namely equilibrium and resonance. Few of us do in life that which resonates the most with our makeup.  Too few of us act in a manner that improves the global equilibrium.<br /><br />Coelho points out that it is survival oriented myopia and complacency that frustrates the alchemist from achieving resonance, purification, and equilibrium. Not choosing a personal pilgrimage or letting the opportunity to be a pilgrim slip by is nevertheless a choice. As with all alchemy, the main character chooses to allow for failure in the faith (and not destiny or preordination as some reviewers have claimed) in success in order to make advances.theless a choice.

B000BJ7BCK|3.0|I saw this on an airplane. I was surprised by it as it was descent. It is a kid's movie for sure which is a shame. I thought a movie like this but more PG-13ish and dark would have been a lot cooler. But it's pretty good.  <br />It centers around a high school for superheroes and one boy trying to obtain his superheroes. Of course there's fighting evil and stuff which is interesting.  <br />The movie is entertaining, packs some good humor and is a sold rental if you've got nothing better to do. <br />But I was surprised and actually entertained by this kid's movie. The kids will love it, the older ones might. But adults shouldn't.
B0000020T3|5.0|I know Roy Loney fans will disagree with me (pointing to \\"Teenage Head\\" as the Groovies' finest album), but I considor this to be the band's best album. The Groovies were, at the time, a complete anachronism. Few bands were as unabashedly old fashioned in sound as them. While other bands were making \\"rock\\" albums with overloads of synthesizers and production, the Groovies were making albums that sound like they could've come out during the British Invasion. However, this wasn't a bad thing, far from it. The group showed how great classic rock 'n' roll was, rejecting the pretenses that plauged the lame arena rock bands that were popular at the time. Their albums after this were good but inconsistent. Those albums had moments of brilliance, but also had a good amount of filler and uninspired covers. This album, however, is great from start to finish. Not to mention the fact that the title track is, as many people have noted, one of power pop's finest moments. As I stated above, this album was a complete anachronism when it was released. However, they were one of the first bands to do this, paving the way for many subsequent power pop bands and becoming one of America's greatest cult bands. An overlooked masterpeice, this is the best starting place (along with \\"Groovies Greatest Grooves\\") to get acquainted with one of America's greatest bands.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First, I rarely, if ever, watch TV.  I'd rather not waste my time, thank you very much.  So I had no idea that \\"Firefly\\" existed until we saw the movie, \\"Serenity.\\"  I loved the humor and the concept of a western set in outer space, and as soon as I realized that \\"Firefly\\" was offered on DVD, I had to buy it. <br /> <br />We loved it.  Three of us watched all fourteen episodes in two days, back-to-back (and we never, ever watch TV). I personally loved the western outfits and different personalities of the characters.  I especially loved the companion character's outfits - gorgeous.   <br /> <br />There were lines from the series that still stand out, they were so funny.  We also found ourselves cheering for the characters and more than once saying \\"I hope he kills that guy\\" whenever a bad guy crossed our heroes. <br /> <br />Many things about \\"Firefly\\" stood out, making this a unique experience in my mind.  I liked the Asian influence mixed in with the wild west setting.  I also thought the violence, while sometimes graphic, was gross and fun, like watching \\"Kill Bill\\" or \\"Reservir Dogs.\\"  I liked how the characters seemed like a family and were each unique and interesting in their own way, though I think I liked Inora (the companion) the best because she had to love the Captain from a distance and, of course, she had the best fights with him.      <br /> <br />I think it's too bad the show was axed only after 14 episodes.  I would have loved to watch more episodes, but I am glad that at least they made the movie \\"Serenity\\" to tie up loose ends. <br /> <br />I'm not a \\"Star Trek\\" or \\"Buffy\\" fan or whatever (didn't watch them), so I'm not biased that way.  I'm just somebody who watched the movie \\"Serenity\\" and ending up buying the TV series as a result.  All three of us loved \\"Firefly\\" (two adults and an 11-year old), if that means anything.  I highly recommend it.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Like the Strokes' first two efforts, \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" is a treasure that avails its gifts upon the third or fourth listen rather than immediate fructose for the ear. Guitarist Nick Valensi continues his impressive trajectory into the stratosphere of modern-rock technical masters with some fearsome and adventurous lead work - while complementing Albert Hammond's Christmas-time chiming chords - and we are treated to the usual slightly off-kilter but rock-solid (and ever-hardening) studio consistency from bassist Nikolai Fraiture and the requisite drum machine-styled rattle from Fab Moretti. The songwriting has been urged up a notch in beauty and quality, and there are some great `70s AM-radio major scale resolutions and particularly phenomenal codas for the tracks. Many songs at first contact appear to be slow and calculated, but they reveal themselves to be just as artful as we have come to expect from the Strokes. Unlike those of their many college-rock imitators, the Strokes' new songs are all sophisticated without being museum pieces; the album consists of 14 living and breathing reptiles that will soon render extinct Franz Ferdinand, The Killers and the other Nu-Wavers. New producer David Kahne has somehow retained much of the band's NYC art-rock aesthetic while adding a welcome veneer of studio polish. Singer Julian Casablancas appears to have been successfully challenged to sing without his walkie-talkie-thru-a-payphone effect and brings out some towering performances that elbow their way up to the front of the mix. <br /> <br />\\"Juice Box\\" throbs with its nimble Munsters-theme bass line before giving way to traditional sneery Strokesian sections, a la \\"Is This It\\" cleaned up with a mop. <br /> <br />\\"You Only Live Once\\" sounds like the second part of a \\"Room On Fire\\" double-A side, replete with Cars-styled vocals and guitars. <br /> <br />\\"Heart In A Cage\\" rages into being with cascading scales from Valensi, and Casablancas' usual sense of lyricalfrustration. <br /> <br />\\"Razor Blade\\" swaggers in with its lazy reggae beat, suggesting an even more tuneful sequel to \\"When It Started\\" from \\"Is This It.\\" A fine candidate for the second single after \\"Juicebox.\\" <br /> <br />\\"On the Other Side\\" is a stripped and tripped haunter with a soulful, meandering Sam Cooke chorus that will delight fans of \\"Under Control\\" from \\"Room On Fire.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Vision of Division\\" rollicks in with rocking chords that suggest Gomez or Blur. <br /> <br />\\"Ask Me Anything is a grower\\" - the usual enigmatic lyrical fare from Julian (read: \\"Don't be a coconut, God is trying to talk to you\\") backed by an interesting Mellotron-sounding loop from Valensi in the background. \\"I've got nothing to say\\" lament gets a tad stale after the first dozen incantations. <br /> <br />\\"Electricityscape\\" is another dark-to-lit puzzler. <br /> <br />\\"Killing Lies\\" has the drone of a DVD menu left on by your lazy and asleep roommate, but has that cute video-game affectation that endears us to the Postal Service and Beck's Gameboy remixes. <br /> <br />\\"Fear of Sleep\\" feels like it was written with its title afflicting the author, but it really takes off with its \\"You're no fun\\" coda. <br /> <br />\\"15 Minutes\\" is another slow-burner that goes on for about as long as its title (or so it seems), but displays some nice twinkling arpeggios from the guitars and a NYC subway-paced ending. <br /> <br />\\"Ize of the World\\" kicks off with a metal meltdown like \\"Take It Or Leave It\\" and \\"The End Has No End\\" (from their first two albums, respectively) and then pushes and shoves its way into some friendly and messy CBGBs rock chords and the requisite catchy melodies. In fact, it would be comfortably nestled somewhere in the second half of either of their first two albums. Sounds like Albert stumbling thru the solo. <br /> <br />\\"Evening Sun\\" starts off with some old-fashioned Hammond - downstroking rhythm guitar - and hammering hi-hat from Moretti, all with a bit ofthe Nintendo chord changes we heard on \\"Killing Lies.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Red Light\\" is an uncharacteristically cheerful romp that closes out the album.

0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer has obviously done a great job with this book, since I can't find a single substantive criticism anywhere among these reviews.  No one can show me where he's WRONG.  He's too soft on Christianity, they say.  Even if he is, show me something he presents about Islam as FACT that is actually WRONG.  Is that so hard, people?    Then we have the person below me, who condemns people who describe all Muslims as terrorists.  Fair enough, but since this is a forum for reviews of THIS BOOK, and since I just know no one would post a review without reading it (is the sarcasm obvious enough?), would you care to give us a page number where Spencer says such a thing?    Actually, I'll save you the trouble.  You won't find it.  Spencer is not arguing that all Muslims are terrorists.  What he is saying is that there are disturbing aspects of Islam that can lend themselves to such behavior.  Now don't come back and tell me that the Old Testament contains atrocities.  The point is that no one today is committing violence and using those texts as justification.  This is apples and oranges.    It is absolutely disgusting how many people -- left or right -- come on Amazon with an axe to grind and condemn books they obviously haven't read.  They don't even know how stupid they look, given that half the time they're attributing to the author an opinion he nowhere adopts and expressly disclaims.    (...)
B0000DD7LB|4.0|With her 4th studio album, Britney attempts to step away from the pop limelight and focus on her maturity as an adult. For that, she has done well. <br /> <br />Me against the music (5/10) Britney's first single that became a hit in america and outside. I dont like this version (the original) and the remix at the end of the album. I reccomend the new remix version of this song on \\"B in the mix: the remixes\\", that one is better. Madonna is featured in this song. <br /> <br />(I got that) Boom Boom (8/10) good, hip-hopish like song with a nice beat to it. it features the Ying-Yang twins. <br /> <br />Showdown (8/10) A good song that grew on me   <br /> <br />Breathe on me (10/10) A nice sexy, slow mood type song with a very nice beat to it. Though never released as a single, it is featured in her fragrance commercials and on the second disc of the limited edition of her greatest hits (as a remix). <br /> <br />Early morning (1/10) Bad song with some minor cuses in it, the remix version on \\"B in the mix: the remixes\\" is better. <br /> <br />Toxic (10/10) Another one of her singles that became a world wide mega hit and garnered her first grammy. the video is awesome and the song is great to dance to.  <br /> <br />Outrageous (1/10) Britney's fourth and final single that failed on the charts. A video was shot for it but was cut short after becoming injured. This song isnt very good and R.Kelly didnt help at all either with his small appearance. <br /> <br />Touch of my hand (8/10) A controversial song that may lead some to believe its about masturbation. despite that, its still a nice sorta slow song to listen to. <br /> <br />The hook up (8/10) Good song, like \\"Showdown\\" it will grow on you. and may get stuck in your head to. <br /> <br />Shadow (10/10) My favorite song on the album, its such a sweet ballad that shows britney can sing. it also brought a tear to my eyes a few times, very good song. <br /> <br />Brave new girl (7/10) Its alright, not one of my favorites.the lyrics are terrible though. and it sounds like some barbie girl type song. <br /> <br />Everytime (10/10)  Another one of her singles that became an instant hit. the video was a bit controversial for at the end it seems like she commits suicide, but then amerges and laughs.  <br />This song is sweet and nice, though its not her strongest ballad. <br /> <br />Overall the album is good and for any britney fan this is a must have. i say buy it anyway, even if your not a fan. you might like it.
B00005JOFO|2.0|Brokeback Mountain is by far the most disappointing film of the year. The glowing reviews are flowing in every major magazine and by every major critic. My friends kept telling me how amazing it was, how beautiful, and how achingly real. My boyfriend and I headed into the theatre excited and ready to be amazed. Half the audience applauded once the film was over. My boyfriend and I were relieved it didn't go on longer. <br /> <br />The film starts off slowly, and goes on way too long, but that's not the problem. The main problem is that the film tries to be so artsy with its two second scenes and excruciating shots of nature, it never gives its audience a chance to know the characters. The main love story between two men lovers is never fleshed out, and I never understood what drew them together or why they had such a long and lasting relationship. All we ever see them do is fish, herd sheep, wrestle topless, skinny dip, and have very rough sex, which I found a really offensive stereotype. I did not notice any love between these two men, animal lust is more like it.  <br /> <br />The story is such a mess, important characters aren't even introduced until a good third of the way into the film, after which their storylines are wrapped up way too quickly. 1963 goes on for 45 minutes, and could have easily been cut down to 15, while the rest of the 20 years the story takes place flashes by. For what? For the sake of seeing our sheep herders (not cowboys by the way) do their job or take a break from it to eat a can of beans, or ten shots of sheep flocking by too many. These scenes do nothing to advance the story and instead make the film tedious and almost unbearable. The time could have been used to flesh out the cardboard characters instead. <br /> <br />I'll give Brokeback Mountain one praise, and that is for its amazing and talented cast. Jake Gyllenhal and Heath Ledger are quite good, and Michelle Williams is terrific. Her long-suffering wife might be a clich, but she is the most fleshed out, and most real character in the film. Anne Hathaway, a great actress, is almost wasted in her brief role, as are Anna Farris and Linda Cardellini, in almost cameo roles, which definitely could have used some fleshing out, or deleting altogether. The rest of their scenes were no doubt deleted to make room for more shots of nature, sheep, and topless wresting scenes between the two men.  <br /> <br />To say BrokeBack Mountain is disappointing is not enough. With all the praise it's receiving, I'd have at least expected a good film, if not a great one. Brokeback Mountain might pretend it's a good film, but it definitely isn't. In fact, it's been done much better before. I should have avoided this mess and seen Rent for the fourth time instead! <br />
B000AYEIZY|5.0|I was lucky enough to see the Cream live in Providence (I'm guessing '68) and would still rate it my best concert ever (including the Beatles, Stones and Hendrix).  I was simply blown away by their power and virtuosity.  The surprising standout was Jack Bruce, whose bass playing stood up to the best rock drummer and guitarist in the world.  Anyway, the new album did not disappoint.  In fact, I'm surprised all three are still alive...

B0007OCG56|1.0|Some of the worst acting ever seen on screen. Sandler is totally unbelievable as an adult to whom any responsibilities would be given. Leoni is a frenzied wreck. Each character is a type rather than a person. None is developed. One leaves the movie exceedingly grateful that caricatures such as these (the husband and wife, both of whom are half-witted or addle-pated)do not inhabit one's world.  <br /> <br />The film is poorly written, execrably acted (except for the Mexican contingent and the banshee's daughter) and directed, wretchedly edited, and a sorry excuse for entertainment. It is totally baffling that anyone would give this morass a positive review. Only the first and last five minutes (featuring the sane mother and daughter) are tolerable.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Robert Plant never fails to amaze with his willingness to build on his past and take his music to new, challenging places.  With the backing Strange Sensation (yes, a real working band, not just session musicians), Plant manages to take Mighty Rearranger to exotic, unexplored terrain.  Every one of his solo releases offer something on a plane just a notch above most everything else out at the time.  Mighty Rearranger ups the ante even further, as I dare to say this is his best, most mature effort.   <br /> <br />Each new album of Plant's seems to bridge back to the last, but slightly updating and \\"rearranging.\\"  His latest reaches back to both Dreamland and even Fate of Nations in various songs, but they never seem like copy-cats.  The album kicks off with the brilliant \\"Another Tribe,\\" which combines his knack for the Middle Eastern flaire and combines it with, well, tribal beats.  My fave on the album is the split personality of \\"Tin Pan Valley,\\"  with it's quiet, seductive techno rhythms which give way to full out rockin' two minutes in.  It's a stunning song, and the retro vs. modern vibe it gives off remind you of 1968 and 2005 at the same time.  \\"All the Kings Horses\\" is a great, self assured acoustical song that reminds me a bit of a longer, more complex \\"Liar's Dance.\\"  Even the title track hits the mark right on, despite its more commerical tendancy (comparatively speaking), rises above the initial expectation.     <br /> <br />I can't really mention each track and give it the review it would rightfully deserve, simply not enough space on the page.  Every track has something new and different to offer and there is little possibility of Mighty Rearranger becoming boring or irrelevant.  These songs make you think, challenge the psyche, AND are exotically enjoyable ear candy.  Not a batch that you'd expect to hear on radio anytime soon, but certainly one of the most rewarding listens to be found anywhere, let alone by a man who could easily rest on his laurels.  If anything, this one gets better with each successive play!

0399143904|5.0|I rate all Tom Clancy's novels high, but this was one of the best. Great mixture of suspense, action and intrique blend nicely with our visceral hatred of terrorists around the world. As the author points out,just the fear of a highly trained multinational group like this would be a deterrent to many of the events that make our news - if not in 2005, then when this novel was written.
0385495323|5.0|I bought this book because I loved Simon Singh's \\"Fermat's Engima.\\"  In that book, he turned what might come across as a rather dry subject into a riveting tale by bringing the people involved to full life.  He explains the complicated mathematics in a way that makes the discussion easily understood.    In the case of \\"The Code Book,\\" I already found the topic of codes to be fascinating, and Singh's talent for making complicated subjects comprehensible is in full form.  His story-telling ability once again shines.    There's quite a bit of interesting and well-written historical overview, from the codes of Mary Queen of Scots up to the cutting edge science of quantum cryptography.  The book is absolutely riveting on the subject of Engima and the Allies' quest to break it.      I started off the book with a basic fascination for the mechanics of codes, and by the end I was drawn into the stories and people behind the codes.        Excellent and fascinating reading.
0553801503|3.0|This book reads as if Martin hired Jordan to do the outline, then transformed the outline into English prose.  Martin's command of fine detail is as strong as ever; it's his perspective that's lacking.  This book is all trees and no forest, and it doesn't go where the reader wants it to go. <br /> <br />For instance, Jaime's struggle to keep his oath to Catelyn Stark, and never take up arms against the Tullys, was well presented, and Jaime's solution was both clever and original.  However, it can't reasonably be called exciting.  In this sense the Riverrun sequence typifies the whole book. <br /> <br />It can be argued that little happens to Arya, and that her chapters are too infrequent compared to, say, Brienne's or Cersei's.  However, there are sly subtleties in them -- notice, for instance, how in one particular chapter her name changes twice in the text to mirror her psychology.  Sly literary touches of this type are much more frequent in this book than the previous three. <br /> <br />The idea that Martin is milking his readership for cash is ludicrous to me; one does not maximize one's fortune by writing one long novel every five years.  Instead, one writes a short novel two or three times a year, like Dean Koontz. <br /> <br />That said, I hope there's more overt conflict in the next book than in this one.  It's been observed there can't be much conflict in Dance With Dragons, or we'd have heard about it in this book, which covers the same chronological period.  I hope that proves false.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|What a fun flick.  This movie is what the new Star Wars movies should have been.  Witty dialogue and an intricate plot  make it the kind of movie that not only sci-fi fans, but movie fans of all genres have been waiting for.  If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?  And pick up the tv series while your at it, while you don't need to see the series to get the movie, it will certainly make you care abou the characters a whole lot more.  Pop some popcorn and enjoy!
B000BCE918|4.0|Yeah, I know the title of this review is corny, but you have to admit that this is a pretty nice boxed set.  It contains all three films from the \\"Jurassic Park\\" film series.  The first film stands alone as one of the most impressive and progressive films of its time.  It featured the best special effects of its time and each film builds on these effects.  Let's break each film down:<br /><br />\\"Jurassic Park\\" Five stars<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest dinosaur film ever made, \\"Jurassic Park\\" features brilliant special effects, wonderful acting and a great plotline filled with suspense and horror.  With Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough heading up a small cast of characters including Samuel L. Jackson, this film is sure to be a winner in anyone's collection.  Briefly, this is the tale of a man who hopes to cash in on genetically bred dinosaurs by creating a sort of theme park that allows the average man to get an up-close-and-personal look at T-Rex, stegosaurus, and those wicked velociraptors.  Of course, when a small group arrives to approve the park, things go awry.  Highly recommended flick worthy of multiple views.<br /><br />\\"The Lost World\\" Three Stars<br /><br />The weakest flick in the series.  Jeff Goldblum reprises his role from the original flick as he goes to a second island where the dinos from the original film were allowed to grow before being shipped to the park.  He's there to help a small group study the dinosaurs in an environment untouched by man.  Then a gang of hunters come along in a last ditch effort to save the pocketbooks of the JP stockholders and bring a T-Rex back to San Diego, CA to cash in.  Unfortunately, this film was weighed down by eco-terrorism and way too many characters.  Though the cast was very good, there just wasn't enough to work with here.  Not worthy of many viewings, but it's nice to have in the set.<br /><br />\\"Jurassic Park III\\" Four stars<br /><br />The best sequel and it saves the saga from the forgettable \\"Lost World.\\"  This film brings back Sam Neill's character who gets conned into going back to the islands and ends up having to save the son of a wealthy and on-the-outs couple(played wittingly by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni).  It has a brief but wonderful cameo by Laura Dern and takes a potshot at the purple dino, Barney.  This film is the most wide open of the bunch as it ditches the suspense of the original and the morality tale of \\"Lost World\\" and goes straight for the action.  It's a wonderful popcorn flick that works well for what it is.  Definitely worthy of multiple viewings and definitely worth owning.<br /><br />As a whole, this set is really wonderful to own.  You get all three films for less than the price of two of them if you purchased each separately.  The packaging is pretty cool since it resembles the opening gates that are so famous from the first film.  There are plenty of extras for folks into that kind of stuff and two out of three of these films is worth watching more than once.  The original flick is timeless, \\"JPIII\\" is a rollercoaster ride, and \\"The Lost World\\" is nice to have if you're a completionist.  Get this set today if you can't get enough of the dino-action and dino-horror that is the \\"Jurassic Park Adventure Pack.\\"rgettable \\"Lost World.\\"  This film brings back Sam Neill's character who gets conned into going back to the islands and ends up having to save the son of a wealthy and on-the-outs couple(played wittingly by William H.

B000002JOH|5.0|It's funny all the people who say Pantera sucks and all.  If you look at the reviews of this album before 2000, they're all 5 stars... and now... whatever. <br />You kids know nothing of Pantera so dont even start.  Go listen to Simple plan and Sum 47 or whoever. <br /> <br />THIS ALBUM IS BALLS.  This is by far one of the greatest if not THE greatest metal album of all time.  For you kids even under the age of 17, maybe some 16s, you wouldn't respect the messages given by these gods of metal.  And Dimebag, don't even get me started, anyone who plays a guitar, looks up to Dimebag or should at least because, not me, not you, NO ONE will ever be DIMEBAG.  Peace!  F**K LINKIN PARK!
B00004U8JV|3.0|Until \\"Jurassic Park III\\" came along, I thought that \\"The Lost World\\" had driven the final nail into the \\"JP\\" coffin.  \\"The Lost World\\" had a lot of things going for it, including returning star Jeff Goldblum, up-and-comer(at the time) Vince Vaughn, legend Pete Postlethwaite, solid actress Julianne Moore and wonderful but brief cameos by Richard Attenborough and the kids from the first flick.  It also had the coattails of its predecessor almost ensuring a huge profit margin on name alone.  It also had one of the best directors of the modern age, Steven Spielberg, and the SFX crew from the original film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, all of these ingredients just didn't add up for \\"The Lost World.\\"  It's rather boring, in fact.  Goldblum still has that annoyingly cool aura about his character, but he can't carry a film on his own without Sam Neill and Laura Dern to support him.  Spielberg seems to be too caught up in the brilliance of the CGI effects to worry much about plot development.  There were just too many characters and, yes, too many dinosaurs early on to really interest anyone in a film that runs at just a tad over two hours long.<br /><br />The best character in this film, in my opinion, is Pete Postlethwaite's Roland Tembo.  His character develops more than any other in the flick, and he's actually a likeable guy by the time the flick's over.  Moore and Vaughn don't have much to work with.  In fact, I ended up hating Vaughn's tree-hugging, seal-lovin' character.  If you aren't aware of groups such as the one Vaughn's character represents, then you don't know just how scary and outright idiotic some of these groups can be.  They'll sacrifice themselves and the rest of humanity to save one little creature.  In fact, many of these groups have done more damage by destroying private property than actually helping animals.  Anyway, enough of my soapbox, Vaughn just got on my nerves after awhile.<br /><br />Spielberg tried to cram way too much into this film.  While watching the film we get bio-terrorism, poacher-esque squads out to capture a prize, greedy stockholders(aren't they all), and overly eager paleontologists.  Throw all of that into a film that jumps from Isla Sorna to San Diego, CA, cuts loose a T-Rex on said California town, manages to jam a family argument or two between the lead actor and his daughter and billions of extras that fill the bill as dino-food and you get too much information and not enough explanation.<br /><br />The special effects are excellent, as expected.  John Williams does a wonderful job with the spectacle he's given by managing to build a little suspense with his music despite the lack of suspense in the film.<br /><br />So why did I give it three stars?  It gets two stars for the music and special effects, and Peter Postlethwaite deserves his own star here.  The rest of this film is just too flimsy to deserve more than three stars.<br /><br />Sadly, this is a pretty bad film.  I hoped that it would be so much more.  Instead of being the suspenseful horror tale that the original film was or even the fun action yarn that \\"JPIII\\" was, we are given a morality tale with mixed morals. Not worthy of multiple viewings, and only worth owning for idiot completionists such as myself..

0060764899|5.0|My father read this story to me as a child.  I was only lucky enough to get a chapter each night.  I remember wanting more.  Wanting the story to be read faster.  Reading it now, years later, I'm impressed with how it still captivates me.  This story is about four children who move into a large house away from their family.  While playing hide-and-seek one rainy day they find a wardrobe that takes them to a magical land, Narnia.  In Narnia they learn of an evil White Witch that has caused it to be winter all the time.  The children, work with the lion king to try and restore some order to Narnia.  This is a perfect story for adults and children alike!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had the TV show and movie recommended to me by a co-worker a few months back. When he described the premise (old west combined with sci-fi), I was a bit dubious. I said I would probably see the movie just to give it a try, but as I wasn't that gung-ho about it, I never made seeing it at the big screen. <br /> <br />Looking around for Christmas and having some down time over the holidays, I saw the reviews for this on Amazon.com. It again piqued my interest so thought well the movie is coming out on DVD so what the heck... <br /> <br />I saw it the other night and was indeed pleasantly surprised... it is one of the most original and better movies I have seen in a long while. What grabbed me most and from the start was what all the reviewers had been saying - the characters - 9 most different and individual characters all with their quirks, good sides, bad sides (crazy sides), etc.  <br /> <br />I felt that everyone of them had a history behind them, some cloaked in mystery, some not so, but each intriguing in their own way. This just in the first 30 minutes...not so much told verbatim by the characters and lines, but just the way they were written and portrayed, and the atmosphere. That is rare. I felt that boy!, I really would like to get to know these people - good or bad - and what in their pasts led them to this, what motivations drive them, what secrets they have, etc. <br /> <br />I could also see the bonds and comradeship between them, a family - a disfunctional family for sure, but still a family. Again this seemed to really just flow out of the movie by subtle dialogue, good writing, and good acting.  <br /> <br />It had some delicious humor, some good action (some a little far fetched but what action movies don't), some surprises, great characters, interesting storyline. All that left me wanting more. <br /> <br />So out to buy the series. Saw the first episode (the original 2 hour pilot that was axed in favor of a more action packed 1 hour episode by thestudio execs - as usual a \\"brilliant\\" decision by them - not..). <br /> <br />Anyway, again very interesting storyline, good and diverse characters, got to know how things got started for the current group, and looking forward to watching the rest, but also sad that I know it is limited... <br /> <br />I cancelled my cable last year because I never watched TV much and decided to see if I would miss all the junk they put on - in over a year I really haven't. Maybe because they keep putting the same \\"stuff\\" on - reality shows, extreme makeovers, show that glorify pulling others to pieces in public, etc, instead of more original shows like Firefly looks to be. <br /> <br />Is it perfect? no, (nothing is)...is it the best show ever? Not for me... But this show and characters grabbed me as no other has for a while, and that's saying something. So decided to write my views and opinion here where I started my journey into the Firefly universe...  <br /> <br />I hope someone will come along and pick this show up again somehow as I feel it still has much promise, but kinda doubt it..originality seems to be a thing of the past nowadays...sad... <br /> <br />Mike Haslam
0440238609|3.0|I am a big, long time fan of fantasy literature, particularly that written for young adults. Based on the reviews of this trilogy, I was expecting, and hoping, to find a really enthralling work that would measure up to The Dark is Rising and the Harry Potter books.  I was disappointed.  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I found Pullman's writing style a bit forced and contrived.  It took me quite a while to feel engaged with the characters, and I don't think I ever really felt sympathy with Lyra, the main character.   <br /> <br />I didn't find the existential premise troubling, in fact, I think it was the most original and best part of the book.  The multiple worlds premise was interesting, but I didn't find the alternate worlds all that believable. <br /> <br />In the end, I would say that the books were entertaining, but probably would not read them again.  To those considering these books, I would recommend books by Susan Cooper or Lloyd Alexander instead.
B000084T18|5.0|50 delivers on his released album. Yes he talks about being shot, yes he talks about money and yes he talks about women. But don't let that take away from the fact that the beats are hot and his lyrical content is better than expected. I ain't riding him (check out my review for The Massacre) but this album is class. Virtually every song is good with the standouts being the more gangsta tracks such as Heat and Many Men. Think what you will but this is an album worth buying and will forever be a classic. <br /> <br />Top 5: <br /> <br />Heat <br />Many Men <br />U Not Like Me <br />Patiently Waiting <br />Don't Push Me

B000ATQYT2|5.0|I purchased a copy of this movie as part of my project to aquire movies I consider useful for understanding American culture so I can show them to my foreign friends.  Then I watched it for the first time in at least 10 years.  It is still an excellent movie. <br /> <br />First of all, Jim Henson was a genius.  The jokes in the movie stood the test of time and the artwork in this movie is still incredible.  Moreover, there are dozens of cultural references to the Muppets so it is useful for foreigners to know at least a little bit about them.  In addition to that, this generally follows the story line of A Christmas Carol so it is also useful because there are dozens of references to A Christmas Carol. <br /> <br />However, it made me a bit sad to watch it because the newer versions of Henson's creations simply lack the flare which was there when he was alive.  If only he had lived longer...
B00005JO1Y|3.0|bomb after bomb made the moviegoer desperate.with the exception of batman begins,this was yet another blase year(munich should be a good comeback from his war of the worlds disaster!!!!!!!!!!).im not a fan of fantasy movies and havent seen a minutes worth of the rings.too many things have to be taken for granted ''you cant levitate and float through walls?!?!?!? everyone in the village of snoozeville can!''.with kong,its a fantasy movie with humans.earthly humans.set in a time i can relate to,sort of.now the original,while lacking obviously in CGI technology,didnt need 5 zillion dollars or screen hours to tell the tale.the flaws have been mentioned and far be it for be to exclude my reiterations.biggest flaw...TOOO....DAMNED....LONG!!!!!!! runners up and honorable mentions....the dino stampede with the wee humans,ann's impersonation of a ragdoll yet unbruised and very much in love,brody being the love interest 2nd in line(how did he even make the line in the first place?!?!?),everything about jack black(mostly him dedicating the film to every person that died for HIS cause...what a place for humor,pete!!!!),10 0000 hours of getting to skull island,no minutes of them getting kong TO nyc.kong gets slapped up with chlorophorm and next thing we see is him on stage.for such an excruciatingly long start,the so called charactor developement was shoddy at best,the acting even more non existant.sure,this is a beefed up remake with a director with too much time/money but its really not great.as with A vs P,war of the worlds,the 1st batch of batman movies etc,directors took unmuck-up-able projects and completely.......well,mucked it up.in closing,the original was great because of the story,this is POPULAR because of its excesses.
1400031087|1.0|The author gets on an airplane, or rather was put on an airplane, by \\"two men and a doctor\\" and he's got a hole in his cheek that is not stiched, no front teeth, he smells of vomit and urine, he's got blood all over his shirt, his eyes are swelled shut, and he's barely coherent. He rides the plane unattended and relies on the flight attendant to tell him where he is and where he's going?  Name an airline that is going to allow him on the plane in that condition.  A week into rehab he goes to the dentist to fix his four missing teeth.  He gets two root canals, two caps, and a cavity filled, without novacaine. The Dentist, who is not associated with the rehab clinic but \\"helps out our people\\" tells the author \\"your addiction recovery prohibits the use of pain killers and anesthetic\\".  Any medical professional will tell you novacaine is not addicting so that reason is not medically accurate-plus he's already by his own words receiving pain meds at his rehab clinic for his detoxification issue.  By stretching this claim to it's logical conclusion, if his appendix burst they'll remove it by having him chew on a piece of wood?  And what dental malpractice insurance policy would allow this practice? What dentist in this litigious era would do this? <br />Every character so far introduced in the 54 pages I've read is straight out of central casting. I don't know how much further I will read.  I'm sorry for the author if he did go through all of what I read, but I'm not sold on his story either.
B000BO0LLS|4.0|It's great to see that in this edition you will own a few more songs and video as well but I hope that Mariah also can do the same thing to her Charmbracelet album. I just hope that Mariah will re-released her Charmbracelet which will includes a few extra her songs such as there goes my heart, got a thing 4 you, miss you and i know what you want and videos such as through the rain, boy I need you, bringin' on the heartbreak and I know what you want. If she can do to the Emancipation of Mimi, why not Charmbracelet?
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I was totally wowed by this movie. I poped in my DVD player and was entertained and inrtigued through out the whole movie. The characters are strong, and the cast that is portraying them is excellent. Natalie Portman is AUSOME in this movie, so is Julia Roberts. The diolouge is snappy and unexpected, and the ending is astounding. This is the type of movie that takes you on a ride, and you have no idea where you will end up.  I love the gritty, real life feel of the characters, this is it not glossed over. It looks like they used natrual light when filming, so that it gives it a natrual look to it. The only problem that I had this movie was that some of the language was a bit harsh, but not enough to detract from a five star movie!!
0743539133|5.0|After being very disappointed in Goodwin's No Ordinary Time about FDR's handling of the Second World War, this book was a very pleasing, very riveting surprise that I found myself wishing it would keep going on. <br /> <br />The book begins with the race for the 1860 Republican nomination for president, which Lincoln was an absolute long shot to win.  Nevertheless, Lincoln and his allies' effective use of backroom politicking is revealed as a masterful effort, resulting in his nomination over much better known national candidates.  Welding together the bruised egos and reputations of those who he had defeated, Lincoln then turned to those same national leaders and formed a cabinet to combat the most challenging period faced by a 19th century president- the Civil War. <br /> <br />Team of Rivals reveals the backstage dramas that came with self-important men, the chalenges of running a country that was fighting itself, and the threats posed by external issues such as foreign relations.  Lincoln's personal efforts to mollify, cajole, and out-maneuver his rivals are strikingly shown, revealing the mastery he had over the men of his era and foresight he carried to his tragic end. <br /> <br />Of all the audio books I have ever listened to, this one makes my top three with D-Day and Citizen Soldiers.
B000006MS3|5.0|\\"The Dreaming\\" is without a doubt Kate's best album, when it came out in 1982 it didn't sell very well at all and critics panned it. Now, a couple of decades on many are calling it a classic, her masterpiece. Well they have a right to say that because it is, instead of trying to imitate her previous three album's piano base on this album she decided to go more along the lines of risky vocal textures and layers. Her combination of at times almost Yoko Ono like vocal layers and weird instruments make it seem foreign to even the most avid of Kate Bush fanatics.<br /><br />\\"The Dreaming\\" is a very screamy affair with high pitched warbles and distorted alto tones, however even though the songs come across very complicated and stylistic the listener does find some sort of simplicity within. The album is awash with themes from bank robberies (There Goes A Tenner), war (Pull Out The Pin) to even the English's effect on native Australians (The Dreaming). I can see why critics might have hated this album. I believe it was so experimental for it's time that people were afraid to accept it. Even today it sounds foreign and alien.<br /><br />Compared to her other albums this is her most experimental and frightening. The songs are really dark and spooky and the combination of instruments are unique and superb. You'll find no similarities to any of her other albums on this effort.<br /><br />The singles from this album were commercial failures but Kate's music isn't about making money it's about creating true, honest music that will wow everyone. Heck, she's only ever done one tour in her whole career. This album isn't about chart standings, it's about appreciation of the music and Kate herself.<br /><br />Kate has always been known for her abstract lyrics, they even influenced Tori Amos!! On this album the complexity is no different, a few examples:<br /><br />(The Dreaming) \\"Bang goes another Kanga on the bonnet of the van... Many an Aboriginie's mistaken for a tree,<br /><br />'Til your near him on the motorway, the tree begin to breathe.\\"<br /><br />(Leave It Open) \\"With my ego in my gut, my babbling mouth would wash it up.\\"<br /><br />(Sat In Your Lap) \\"My cup she never overfloweth and 'tis I that moan and groaneth.\\"<br /><br />There, three more examples of why this album surprised everyone upon release and why it is so ornate and intricate. Kate's work is like ice-cream, it's good no matter what the flavour and it's consistent. Don't listen to the haters who bash this album for being to inventive they are obviously just in private awe over how good this is.<br /><br />Overall, I love this album. You often find albums that are great but you really find exceptionally great ones, albums that will stand the test of time, albums that are classics in every right and albums that are daring and new. Kate may have left the critics wondering what the heck she was doing back in 1982 but now, in 2006 we realise what a true genius she is. So, go out and buy this album, in fact buy all her albums because she really is a genius!Til your near him on the motorway, the tree begin to breathe.\\"  <br /> <br />(Leave It Open) \\"With my ego in my gut, my babbling mouth would wash it up.\\" <br /> <br />(Sat In Your Lap) \\"My cup she never overfloweth and 'tis I that moan and groaneth.\\" <br /> <br />There, three more examples of why this album surprised everyone upon release and why it is so ornate and intricate.

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|(3.5 stars) For the most part, the new Strokes' CD is the best kind of exuberant, straightforward rock 'n' roll that is generally missing from today's musical landscape.  The first single, \\"Juicebox,\\" is certainly one catchy tune that I'll be listening to often in the coming days.  As others have noted, this CD does show more diversification in the band's sound, so now there is more variety to their tempos and melodies than before.  The willingness to expand and experiment is something I applaud, but it probably contributed to the album's slight \\"sag in the middle.\\"  In particular, I found myself drifting off a little during songs 5, 7 & 11, where the songwriting gets less interesting.  Those three tunes are relatively forgettable, but the rest of First Impressions is great.
0895260131|1.0|Arabs and the muslim religion are one of the few minorities left in this county that can be openly slandered at will and this opportunist and liar takes advantage of that bias and ignorance.  This book is full of lies and garbage history.  I spent many years in Arab countries while I was in the Marines and was wounded in Beirut.  Unlike the chickenhawks who like this sort of tripe I've been there  and know that equating all Muslims or Islam itself with terrorism is the same as saying all Christians are Timothy McVeighs or KKK'ers.  Pathetic.
B00008976Y|5.0|Blue examines what happens to the heroine when the worst personal disaster occurs that one could imagine. She retreats within herself . . . wanting nothing more to live without attachments, friends or lovers. At first she succeeds, but life has a funny way of pulling us back into the thick of it. It's astounding how much feeling and emotion is transmitted by this film without dialogue. The symbolism of life is everywhere; Julie is bombarded by it. Take the example of the symbolism of the aged bungy jumper or tightrope walker on her mother's tv screen. The symbolic subplot of the aged woman trying to place the bottle into the trash is introduced, but, in Blue, Julie closes her eyes to the scene. Blue is the story of our interior emotions and how people can fold into themselves. The symbolic subplot of the musical score works well because it reveals Julie's emotional state: at first, she tries to destroy the music, then hears it played by a street flutist, and, in the end, she works on the score . . . symbolizing her character's change. Her inner state is also revealed by the beautifully filmed swimming pool scenes. Echoes of Kieslowski's No End occur in this first entry of Kieslowski's trilogy.
068484267X|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  It's pure, honest, and will shake your own depressing life out of you.
B000002H2H|5.0|This quite simply is a excellent album. To me it is the second best heavy metal album ever produced and a huge step in the right direction for the band form the album kill em all. Kill em all was a very good album although it was immature and the lyrics on the album do that term justice.     Ride the lightning really changed the heavy metal world, songs like for whom the bell tolls and especially fade to black where songs that had not been heard of in heavy metal yet metallica could dish out songs like this and it is one of the main reasons why they ruled the 80's so much that every band in some sort of way was influenced by metallica.    James sings alot better in this album compared to kill em all, although he still screams and has a high pitched voice it suits the album and no other singer could rip these songs out like james did. James rythum guitar work is brilliant in every song but especially in the title track, ride the lightning, fight fire with fire and creeping death.     Kirk hammetts solos are also brilliant, although not very talented in song writing and writing his own solos kirk hammett could play the heck out of a guitar and his solos are dished out in inch perfection and he truly is an amazing guitarist in this album, his solos on the title track, fight fire with fire and especially creeping death are awesome.     Lars gets better on this album, lars was not a great drummer in the early metallica days although he does a decent job on this album, his highlight is his furious drumming on fight fire with fire and creeping death and he does a pretty good job on trapped under ice.     The highlight of the album is the perfect sound of cliff burtons bass, cliff burton was the best bass player in the world at the time in the heavy metal world if not in any music genre. Cliff practicessed his bass playing 4-6 hours every day and although he was only 22 at the time of ride the lightning his bass playing in songs such as the title track, for whom the bell tolls and especially his lead bass work in the instrumental the call of ktulu are amazing. Cliff shines on the call of ktulu, he truely made bass players come out and take notice of him.   Ride the lightning was a album with dark lyrics and about death but it is an amazing album and 8 tracks of brilliance.     1. Fight fire with fire - 20/20 - madness and complete mayhem sum up this song. It starts off with acoustic guitar and sounds like a country and western song but metallica must of done this so they could really blow you away because once the intro stops this song rips into one of the best and fastest thrash songs ever, ripping solos, lightning fast rythum guitar, super fast bass and lars ulrich must of had smoke coming out of his arms playing this one. Excellent lyrics about the end of the world due to nuclear warfare. brilliant song. the riffs on this song are 100 miles an hour.    2. Ride the lightning - 19.5/20 - This is also a great song about being put to death by electric chair execution. this song stops and changes so many times, beautiful solos and ripping riffs. great song.    3. For whom the bell tolls - 20/20 - This song is my favourite metallica song of all time along with orion(master of puppets), this song is absolutely brilliant. From the sound of the bells to the ripping riffs. The intro is all cliff on his bass guitar, he truely could make his bass sound like lead guitar. the lyrics are about war, the best metallica song ever made, a concert favourite and one hell of a song.    4. Fade to black - 20/20 - This is my second favourite metallica song of all time. This song truely indicates metallicas unique sound. They could get away with songs like this, it starts off slow and rips into a truely classic metal song. kirks solos are brilliant and the lyrics are about suicide and also the band wrote this when there equipment was stolen when touring.    5. Trapped under ice - 18.5/20 - Not one of the most popular metallica songs but still a good song.This is a true thrash metal song and is played at 100 miles an hour. good song although far from there best. the lyrics are about drowning.    6. Escape - 19/20 - This is a song that even the band admitted was not a good song, hence the reason why metallica has never not once played this song in concert. Although i think it is a great song, it has crunching riffs and this song has grown on me after a few listens.    7. Creeping death - 20/20 - One hell of a song, one of my favourite metallica songs and an unbelievable thrash metal song. This song is up there with the song master of puppets, crunching riffs, crazy solos and an unbelievable middle sction where the words \\"die die\\" are screamed out. The lyrics in this song are the best metallica lyrics ever, read the lyrics carefully, ill leave that up to you. This song is outstanding simply brilliant.    8. The call of Ktulu - 20/20 - unbelievable. Cliff burtons lead bass in this instrumental are incredible, james ryhtum guitar work is excellent and kirks solos are very very good. All four members of the band combine brilliantly to bring you an instrumental which is only bettered by orion(master of puppets).    Ride the lightning is one hell of a album and a must to any metal head. This album is only just shadowed by master of puppets and to me is the second best heavy metal album ever produced. Once you pick up the cd, the cover tells you alot about the album, death, darkness and fury and it is easily metallicas best album cover. Long live thrash metal

B00004YWEB|5.0|If your idea of Ac/Dc is that everything must be like Back in Black then you probably aren't much of a true fan.  If you love albums like high voltage or powerage or stiff upper lip or ballbreaker than you will like the laid back and blues-rock style of this album.  I listen to and own every Ac/Dc album and have every concert video and have seen them three times in concert.  I have learned their songs on guitar and played them at clubs and restraunts for money- this is a good album if you like Ac/Dc! <br />    Let's face it- in order to enjoy any new Ac/Dc you have to ignore the completely lame lyrics and uninspired themes that Brian Johnson comes up with, he is not a tenth as witty and clever as Bon Scott, so just enjoy the album already!  The guitar riffs are catchy and bluesy and the drumming is a little jazzy, not anything like Phil Rudd's style but still good. <br />    I listen to this underrated album as much as anything Brian Johnson did and it is the perfect mellow Ac/Dc for my wife to enjoy with very catchy tunes.  No filler at all on this album, if you like the old school bluesy Ac/Dc!
B00003CX8N|4.0|\\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" is a film that pointedly reminds me that I do not read enough books.  Specifically, I have not read many of the books that are the subject of the charming correspondence that passes between Helen Hanff (Anne Bancroft), an outspoken writer living in New York City, and Frank Doel (Anthony Hopkins), a much more restrained bookseller in London.  In the time after World War II, Helen sends her first letter to Marks & Cohan, the \\"antiquarian booksellers\\" whose advertisement she had found in a magazine.  She is looking for some books written by English readers that she cannot find in New York and sends the company a list of what she wants, even though she is scared that \\"antique\\" means \\"expensive.\\"  Several weeks later she receives a reply from Marks & Cohan, offering to sell her some books from a correspondent who signs the reply \\"FPD.\\"<br /><br />Eventually Helen will find out that \\"FPD\\" stands for Fran Doel, but their long-distance friendship has already begun in earnest.  Hearing of the rationing that is still going on in Britain, Helen starts sending care packages, which Frank shares with others of the staff.  Then Helen begins to receive letters from other members of Marks & Cohan, thanking her for the gifts and telling her something about their own lives (and about Frank).  The correspondence takes place over twenty years and what we have in this 1987 film is not a drama, but more of a testament to this rather unique friendship.  For me the key scene is when a woman with an American accent walks into the London store and Frank comes out of his office, hoping that it might be the friend he has never seen.  The scene is all the more poignant because while she has snapshots of him, sent by his wife, Nora (Judi Dench), she has never reciprocated, enjoying being a \\"woman of mystery.\\"<br /><br />The chief fun is in the correspondence, especially when she is starts typing in capital letters, a clear sign that she is outraged by Frank having dared to have send her the wrong Latin version of the Bible or an abridged copy of Pepys' diary.  Frank's wit is much drier (it would have to be in comparison, but it is such, none the less), and for the most point he parries Helen's thrusts and occasion attempts at bludgeoning.  The performances by Bancroft and Hopkins reflect the polar opposites of their characters.  Where she is loud and talks all the time he is quiet and seldom speaks.  Of course this plays to the strengths of both actors, but each avoids having their characters descend into caricature.<br /><br />Director David Jones succeeds in fleshing out the story beyond the bare bones of writing and reading letters, but it really is the characters and their relationship that makes this story charming.  There was a television production of \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" in 1975, with Frank Finlay and Anne Jackson, and the book was originally adapted for the stage by James Roose-Evans.  I get the sense that Hugh Whitemore's screenplay is able to take the best from both the original book and the stage version.  All things considered, I think the stage version would have the most appeal, because while the book obviously is the most comprehensive in its inclusion of the correspondence, after watching the movie the thought of Helen and Frank at least ending up on the same stage has an obvious appeal.ared to have send her the wrong Latin version of the Bible or an abridged copy of Pepys' diary.

0553801503|4.0|You have to think of this book and I would guess the next as the calm before the storm.  I read the first 3 books during September and October and I guess If I waited 5 years I would be disappointed too.  However, from my prospective this was the perfect book to follow ASOS.  ASOS was so intense it needed a calming interlude before we go on to the climax.  So I will intently wait for \\"Dragons\\", and hope GRRM is busily writing away on book 6.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Wow. What a package.<br /><br />For a confirmed pathologically obsessed fan of Springsteen, as I adminttedly am, this is akin to finding the Holy Grail.<br /><br />For a fan or student of rock and roll, this is a phenomenally complete look at one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded.<br /><br />This set is comprised of three parts.<br /><br />The first is the sweetly remastered \\"Born To Run\\". You can read other reviews of this album, not only on Amazon, but in every book or magazine that ever discusses \\"all-time great rock and roll albums.\\" It invariably shows up. What you need to know is that it sounds crisp and clear, every instrument balanced in the mix.<br /><br />The second is the documentary on the \\"Making Of\\" the album. It combines fascinating archival footage with current day interviews, and provides a thorough look at not only the nuts-and-bolts  of the recording, but the behind-the-scenes pressure Springsteen was receiving from the record company, other band members, etc. Bruce proves to be funny, humble and introspective, without ever taking himself that seriously. There are tantalizing bits of excised song segments, discussions of what works and what doesn't, and why certain musical ideas were selected over others.<br /><br />The third is an entire Hammersmith concert filmed in November of the year \\"Born To Run\\" was released. While the video quality is not what we've come to expect in this era of crystalline DVD concerts, it certainly is not execrable by any means. It's raw, with moments of beautiful color reproductions mixed with muddy, poorly lit scenes.<br /><br />No matter. I found the peek at the pre-superstar Bruce fascinating. His mix of Van Morrison bop with guitar-slinging solos, howling sax breaks with organ and piano noodling, and high drama (bordering on performance art) with old-fashioned rock-n-roll partying ebullience is wholly original. Watch him \\"perform\\" the epic tale of \\"Jungleland\\" as if it's a stage reading, and then give in to the rock and rhythms of \\"Rosalita\\" as if he's powerless to resist...<br /><br />What you get here is a pristine remaster of one of the great rock albums, a DVD documentary giving it perspective, and an entire, legendary era-specific concert that shows the performer at the (then) height of his burgeoning career.<br /><br />This is awesome.ck and rhythms of \\"Rosalita\\" as if he's powerless to resist... <br /> <br />What you get here is a pristine remaster of one of the great rock albums, a DVD documentary giving it perspective, and an entire, legendary era-specific concert that shows the performer at the (then) height of his burgeoning career. <br /> <br />This is awesome.
0380729407|5.0|This is a book where Dean Koontz 'Funhouse' creation lack - visionary imagination. Bradbury has this unique ability to capture the mind of readers and pull them in a world of dreams that become horribly wrong in a world of doubt. Have you ever seen what an apple can do to you? Have you ever cross a railroad crossing, yet you stop and wonder? I re-read this book again because it is just soo good, yet so evil. A thick plot layered in so many ways that only the wicked be damned. Nightshade and Halloway wants to find out...will you join them?  <br /> <br />A highly recommended masterpiece of a read.....just forget the movie.

B00006F83Y|3.0|If you've just heard of QOTSA and want to buy an album, I'd recommend their newest album \\"Lullabies To Paralyze\\".  The problem with Songs for the Dead is that it drifts in and out of brilliance and the djs' interuptions become nothing more then annoying to me after a while.  The weakest album of a great, great bad.
0316172324|2.0|The author's style makes for a painless, quick read.  However, I felt I wasted my money on too much description, and dismissal of intuition, knowledge, or experience that may be contributing to a person knowing something is awry...one who may be thin slicing (Blink Thinking I believe would be a better term). <br />  <br />He gave examples of how it works successfully for some people, but he didn't or couldn't explain very well why it happens, nor could he give guidance for people to improve their own thinking.  Then he gave examples where it didn't work, so the reader wonders, \\"What's your point?  Does this work or doesn't it?  If you say everyone can do this, well, HOW?\\" <br />  <br />He went on tangents (face reading could be a book of its own, and I would be very interested in that) and tiptoed into areas that might be a bit political - casually saying it's not working for the police who shot someone, it's not working for the military who doesn't want to work off of \\"hunches\\", though in some cases it HAS worked for a leader or two.  It dismisses market research almost entirely, because a singer (who is obviously a favorite of his has yet to make it big), because test audiences didn't like his music, yet thin slice thinkers must.  He seems to contradict himself with his own examples. <br />  <br />Again, not an unpleasant read, but I was craving more.  It's an unfinished work.
B000BVD460|4.0|This is ultimately a greatest hits album that doesn't contain songs that insult Eminem's ex-wife, Kim, who he recently reconsiled with. Therefore, many great songs are missing, like \\"Til I Collapse,\\" which has lyrics about her being addicted to smack.<br /><br />\\"My Name Is,\\" \\"The Real Slim Shady,\\" and \\"Just Lose it,\\" all corny songs that helped him sell millions, are present here, and they don't age well. The references are old and not as funny as they may have been the first few times around.<br /><br />Also present are \\"Lose Yourself\\" (argueably his best song ever), \\"Stan,\\" \\"Mockingbird,\\"; and \\"Like Toy Soldiers.\\" These are all great songs, and he even added the live version of \\"Stan\\" with Elton John at the Grammies. Great choice, especially since that wasn't on any other album.<br /><br />Then there's the song \\"When I'm Gone,\\" which is worth the price of the entire CD. Marshal Mathers confesses his fears about the relationship with his daughter, and hints that he may be done with music for a while. It's his version of Harry Chapin's \\"Cats in the Cradle\\" (not a remix, though, just to be clear). Anyone who doesn't like Eminem for the way he portrays himself might think differently after hearing this. It's not only a great song, but perhaps the hardest one he ever had to write, and it single-handedly saves this album.
B0006J28MI|5.0|This movie moved me. It moved me to tears. The story of Richard Rich is a tragic one. A child and raised without knowing a mother's embrace or a father's guidance. This young lad had his father's love replaced with diamonds and his mother's care replaced with duckets.  <br />While it is true that the movie almost makes light of these facts, I was able to see past the pseudo front act that this movie puts out to see what the producer was really saying.  <br />This movie is dramatic, painful, and at times, depressing. Between this and Shindler's List, I am not sure how we got out of the 90's!

B00000JLWW|5.0|After recently rewatch the Titanic (the VHS version, so I can't comment on the DVD's Material - or lack of, according to some), I sat wondering to the sound of my rewinding tape if that was the greatest movie of I'd ever seen.  I'm still unsure of this, so I won't answer, but I know it's close.  So when I went to Amazon.com and saw a 3.5 star rating for one of the most powerful films I've witnessed I expected so see a flood of typo-infested posts whinning about how long and boring it was. <br />  I was half right.  I found the whinners, but a lot of them seem to by fairly intelligent reviewers, and I can't figure out why.. Did it rob a film you liked at the AA's 11 times?  Were your expectations just too high?  Were you angry all film long at the fool who bet his tickets on a 2-pair?  Because what I saw was a 5 star++ film, start to finish.  Anyways I'm not going to bother with the plot or anything because it's late, and I'm tired, and I'm feeling a bit angry that such a film has the same rating as a Simple Plan  album, and I feel a bit angry that Rome are about to lose Antonio Cassano to Madrid, and <br /> <br />fssgdsdffsdkfjs (bring on your unhelpful ratings, please)
B000002G7G|5.0|Having already purchased The Velvet Underground & Nico and Loaded, I had a little background on the band when I first listened to the album. <br /> <br />These two albums had been lauded as some of the best of all time.  After listening, I thought Loaded was absolute garbage after the first three songs, and felt that the Velvet's debut album had been more influential than good.  VU & Nico is certainly mind-blowing when you consider that it was written at the time simple pop acts such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys were changing rock and roll.  How ahead of their time these guys were is incredible, and that album certainly has its merit and some classic songs, but some songs fall flat and it sometimes becomes a chore to listen to. <br /> <br />This album blew my mind from the first listen.  This is a collection of ten perfect pop songs.  Not only is this album accessible, it's timeless to say the least.  It never gets boring, never has the edge of \\"Venus In Furs\\" or anything off of White Light/White Heat, and never disappoints. <br /> <br />Lou Reed shows his ability to write ballads to perfection, cuts such as \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" were not only incredibly influential but simply a joy to listen to.  The first eight tracks follow this pop-rock ballad pattern (not a boring one or anything).  The true brilliance of the album comes on the last two tracks though.  \\"The Murder Mystery\\" and \\"After Hours\\" are very different from the rest of the album and are two of the best songs ever put to record.  \\"The Murder Mystery\\" is a strange eight-minute collection of acoustic guitars, synthesizers, spoken word, and call-and-response vocals between Lou Reed and Maureen Tucker.  The vibe and atmosphere this song creates is difficult to describe, but it is as interesting as any piece of music I've ever listened to.  \\"After Hours\\" features Maureen Tucker on vocals and a little acoustic guitar strum in the background.  The chord changes aren't brilliant, and Maureen Tucker's voice is off-kilter, but it's captured so perfectly that it seems like a two-minute recording of something heavenly and otherworldly.  The sing-song vocals seem to show that anyone can be a musician if there is that passion inside of them.   <br /> <br />I'd definitely advise you to buy this record, it is essential recording that is on par with the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and the Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\".
B000BGH22W|5.0|Doyle has written a pretty remarkable and consistent score I feel with Goblet of Fire. I was fairly surprised to see how many themes Doyle introduced, and while they aren't as instantly memorable as Williams' themes in the first three, they are still very fitting and more mature than any other material in the previous films.  <br /> <br />I'm proud of Doyle for making this score his own and not relying on Williams' materials and themes and style. He uses Hedwig's Theme twice in the film, in a far more dissonant tone, and that's pretty much it. The rest is entirely new. His action cues are also very impressive, especially The Black Lake, which is dark and heroic. <br /> <br />It pains me to see that not everyone enjoyed this score as much as me. The reality is, Doyle has done his part in maturing the series and giving it more emotional backbone than I could've imagined. Great work. 5 out of 5.

B000AWYOGE|2.0|I really must agree with the consensus here as it relates to \\"Dark Water,\\" the latest American retooling of an Asian release. As much as I honestly wanted to to fully appreciate the positive elements this production had in its favor, I really must label \\"The Ring\\" and \\"Grudge\\" as the two superior films. Like many reviewers here, I saw far too many similarities in plot structure and writing. I pretty much had the entire story summed up two quarters of the way through, and therefore felt no emotional connection to the film's final moments. Telegraphing plot shifts, especially in a motion picture of this magnitude, should never be this simple. The mood, the intricate camera shots, and acting was all there in perfect place. But, ultimately, I found the script required major tweaking in order to avoid these slightly more-than-obvious comparisons. And, as an unfortunate result, I sat through the credit roll with extreme disappointment. <br /> <br />Jennifer Connelly delivered a fairly sound and respectable performance. I only wish she had passed on this project and settled for a far less derivative screenplay. I already hold \\"The Ring\\" in high regard and had never intended on having to endure another variation of the same exact story. It is for that reason that I strongly recommend a prior rental to anybody curious enough to consider blindly adding \\"Dark Water\\" to their collection. Your desire to do so, like mine and seemingly several others who post here, may fade upon a singular viewing. <br /> <br />
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I followed the strokes for about a year now.  I really do like this album and can't wait till I see it in concert. As with many new CDs it takes a few listens to really understand and enjoy the music.  It seems to grow on me with each additional listening.  There are a couple of songs that I do not like, but the rest more than make up for it!  If your new to The Strokes, I'd start out with their first two albums, but if you have any experience with them than I am sure you'll like this album it too.

B0002I831S|5.0|You already know this is the greatest SF TV series ever, or you wouldn't bother reading these reviews to see if everyone agrees with you. I won't give you any ratings for the episodes, because we all (and you know who we are) like every single episode - just some better than others. Now to the important stuff.<br /><br />1) The episodes transfered well to DVD. The sound and images are clear and no obvious changes were made to anything.<br /><br />2) The menu interface is interesting the first few times you use it, then it gets cumbersome.<br /><br />3) The extra content is decent, but I would have preferred commentary by someone actually connected with the show. The Okuda twins didn't come along until TNG, if I'm not mistaken.<br /><br />4) Find the Easter Eggs. Each set has them.<br /><br />Thanks to my lovely wife for getting this set for me. You should all be so lucky.<br /><br />LLAP

0446577383|1.0|This book ended in the trashbin.  We feel betrayed, stabbed in the back by another of our favorite authors.  After spending good money to buy his book, based on our enjoyment of earlier books, we are subjected to a political diatribe.  Maybe these aging authors realize they are not going to be here forever and  feel the need to inflict their personal agendas on their trusting fans while they can.  It would be more honest to write non-fiction.

0940985691|5.0|There are many books for Beginners in Vedic Astrology which are written more like a cook-book, and where essentially you just take a look at the placement of the planet on your chart and then read what it's supposed to mean.  This is not that kind of a book.  This book assumes that you are seriously interested in grasping Vedic Astrology and it guides you step-by-step toward developing a solid level of understanding and competence.<br /><br />The book contains countless correspondencies of planetary influences (grahas), constellations (rashis) and houses (bhavas).  These correspondencies go way beyond just interpreting the natal chart, and enable the skilled jyotishi to get insight into the individual, question or particular situation sometimes even without looking at the chart.  Understanding of these numerous correspondencies can enable jyotishi to assist the individual in successfully dealing with challenging situation.<br /><br />Even though this book is \\"an introduction\\" to Vedic astrology, it may not be the best choice as the very first book on astrology.  For absolute beginners, perhaps a book like Beneath a Vedic Sky may be a better choice to start with.

0805209999|4.0|The 4 star review for this book is, actually, for Kafka, not the translation.  I've read some pretty bad reviews of The Trial's several editions; I think anyone attempting to start their Kafka experience with this novel would give it a terrible review.  The text is rough, and of course incomplete, since Kafka never finished a full novel.  If one reads his novella The Metamorphosis (one of his longer stories which was published in his lifetime), we can see where he may have gone back and edited The Trial.  The story is very compelling, though, and evokes an age which is somewhat parallel to ours...simply that many things go on behind the scenes and outside our field of view, and situations may arise in which we have no idea why we are going through them.  The first sentence of The Trial evokes this...we have no idea why Josef K. is being arrested...it's unimportant to the novel.  The important part is that he believes he never broke the Law, so we must believe him through his trial experience.<br /><br />Since I've had experience with the old Muir translations of Kafka's works, I can say that this translation is so much easier to read.  German is often treated to a ham-fisted English translation and warrants a certain amount of expression on the part of the translator; this one reads very easily, as if it were written in English to begin with.  To conclude, this book would be a great one to get into the mind of Kafka, since it is fragmentary and not yet subject to revision which would undoubtedly have occurred had he not died in 1924.  The very helpful translator's preface as well as the incomplete fragments of chapters in the back also aid this in-depth look.
B00005JO1Y|1.0|Please people, stop going to see remakes.  If we stop going, they will stop making them.  Jackson's Kong was worse than the 70's remake of Kong.  Much worse.  I agree 100% with Floyd the Barber's review.  The only thing I will add is that the scene in NYC when Kong finds Anne in the backlite street is a contender for top 2 worst movie moments in history.  The audience I saw this with laughed out loud at this moment.  I had serious high hopes for this film.  I went to the midnight opening for pete's sake.  But just like the new Star Wars films these hack filmmakers have let the public down.  Most people in this country don't have health care.  But they waste millions of dollars on crap films like this.  So my call to action is to not give them any more of our hard earned money.  Ban all remakes.  Tell Hollywood to get new ideas or get out!  Thank you, that is all.
B00079018K|5.0|When critics talk about a new band being as good as Stone Roses, I am always disappointed.  However this band is actually great and worth keeping an eye on.  They have a sound of their own in spite of their obvious Stone Roses influences.  The singer has a real presence in the music and at least half of the tracks are excellent.  Only 2 tracks fail, but I suspect those would also sound just fine if played in a Manchester club really loud.  That's the point of this music anyway. This is music about the sound and not about the lyrics. I dont give 5 stars easily but this CD deserves it.   <br />
B000000W5B|5.0|I remember when my oldest brother used to play this album when he came home for good from the navy twenty-five years ago.  The first song DANCE WITH MR D is an outstanding opener.  It features the clean rhythm guitar riffs by KEITH RICHARDS, lead and slide guitar riffs by MICK TAYLOR, drums by CHARLIE WATTS, bass guitar riffs by BILL WYMAN, piano by NICKY HOPKINS, lead vocal by MICK JAGGER, and the harmony vocals by KEITH and MICK TAYLOR.  100 YEARS AGO features keyboards by BILLY PRESTON and  electrifying wah wah guitar solos that sound like JIMI HENDRIX.  COMING DOWN AGAIN is an excellent ballad that features excellent lead vocal by KEITH RICHARDS, guitar riffs by MICK TAYLOR, NICKY HOPKINS' piano playing, harmony vocals by MICK and MICK, and a sax solo by BOOBY KEYS.  DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO (HEARTBREAKER) keeps the album and THE STONES in motion and it features the horn section, clavinet by BILLY, guitar riffs by MICK TAYLOR and KEITH RICHARDS, vocals by MICK JAGGER, KEITH RICKARDS, and MICK TAYLOR, drums by CHARLIE, and bass guitar by BILL.  ANGIE is an excellent ballad; however, I do not like the way MICK JAGGER'S voice sounds on this song.  Anyway, the orchestra (a mellotron would have sound a whole lot better), NICKY'S piano playing, the acoustic guitar give this song a relaxing feeling.  SILVER TRAIN puts the album and THE STONES back into the rollin' motion with IAN STEWARD'S piano playing, KEITH RICHARDS' harmony vocal and rhythm guitar riffs, MICK TAYLOR'S bluesy slide guitar, CHARLIE'S drum playing, BILL'S bass guitar riffs, and MICK JAGGER'S lead vocal and harmonica playing.  MICK JAGGER plays excellent piano on HIDE YOUR LOVE besides delivering his lead vocal and harmonica, and MICK TAYLOR plays excellent lead guitar.  MICK JAGGER should have played the piano more often.  WINTER is an excellent ballad with MICK JAGGER'S lead vocal, guitar riffs by KEITH and MICK TAYLOR (including his lead guitar solo), piano by NICKY, orchestra, the drums, and the bass guitar.  CAN YOU HEAR THE MUSIC is an excellent psychodelic (at least that is what it sounds like to me) song that features the leslie or whatever sounding guitar by either KEITH or MICK TAYLOR, piano by NICKY, drums by CHARLIE, bass guitar by BILL, excellent lead guitar by MICK TAYLOR, and the vocals.  Plus, the flute at the beginning of this song sounds like Indian music.  STAR STAR is an excellent guitar rockin' song that also keeps THE STONES rollin along.  It features guitar riffs by MICK TAYLOR and KEITH RICHARDS, MICK JAGGER'S lead vocal, harmony vocals by KEITH and MICK TAYLOR, drums by CHARLIE, and bass guitar by BILL.  Meanwhile, the liner notes and photos match the quality of the album package, especially the photo of the goat's head soup.  I also wonder what they put in front of the band members' faces as they were being photographed.  Other than that, this is definitely a must have for all ROLLING STONES fans.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Quite simply, this is the best live rock performance you will ever listen to.  A band at it's peak performance and extremely tight and in perfect synch.  Every band member stands out in his own right, with a special emphasis on Schenker's guitar work, propelling his reputation as the mad axeman of his era. <br /> <br />Schenker's work on this recording is legendary and will go down in rock history as some of the most brilliant guitar work ever recorded.  The working of a true genius in depth, rhythm, classical influence and pure melody....plain and simple. <br /> <br />Take most marginal talent guitarists producing \\"rock\\" today and most of them would barely qualify as Schenker's guitar technician.  And for most vocalists, they could take some lessons from Mogg and his style and supreme lyrical ability. <br /> <br />This album is an outstanding portfolio of their best work with Schenker, and is even better than the studio versions of the songs on the album.   <br /> <br />I would also encourage you to pick up the new UFO DVD titled \\"Showtime\\" to get an understanding of just how talented Mogg, Way and Raymond are in the studio.  Vinnie Moore and Jason Bonham deserve a lot of respect, but the three original members drive the ship.  The second DVD of studio work shows what these guys are made of, and they still put out excellent work in their fifties!! It is well worth it for that alone. <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br />
B000BVD460|1.0|LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME, that best describes Eminem and his entire fanbase.  Whether or not you want to believe it, eminem fanboy (or girl), eminem essentially released the same cd 4 times.  He finally caught flack for it on encore when even you, the mainstream consumer, admitted the album sucked hard.  Eminems not anymore talented than a Chino XL or RA the Rugged Man, but he looks like a pop star and is on intercourse, whoops, I mean interscope records, so of course anyone will buy his cd. His fanbase primarily consists of 13 year old boys and girls who are mad at their moms and dads for not letting them go to the mall on the weekend for a bad report card.  Anyways, back to the cd, so you take his greatest radio hits (which are even crappier than the rest of the cd) and put them on one cd, and people are still buying it, what the hell are they putting in you peoples cereal?  Use your subconscious if that's what it takes and think for yourself.<br /><br />The Zapper

B000059GEH|5.0|The plot is simple.  Three beautiful girls look for three millionaires. <br /> <br />This was the first comedy filmed in Cinemascope.  To emphasize the Cinemascope aspect, the film opens with a symphony orchestra playing Street Scene.  This is followed by various shots of NYC. <br /> <br />The film starts with Mrs. \\"Shotzy\\" Page (Lauren Bacall) going to look at a flat.  But is she there to rent the apartment or is she there to meet the owner?  Well, the owner has flown the country due to tax difficulties.  She rents the flat with her friend Paula (Marilyn Monroe).  Paula has a friend to be the third roommate, Miss \\"Loco\\" Dempsey (Betty Grable) who picks up men while shopping. <br /> <br />Shotzy has a plan, the best way to meet millionaires is to be in their circles.  The only problem is Loco keeps bringing losers home.  Take for example Tom, the first guy Loco brings back.  Shotzy immediately knows he's a loser, he doesn't wear a tie. <br /> <br />The girls pay their expenses by selling the furniture - it's nice having a tax exile for a landlord.  And they need the money, its been three months and the only bite any of the girls have is Tom chasing Shotzy.  But Loco finally hits pay dirt at Bergdorf's.  She brings home JD Handley (William Powell) from Dallas, Texas as in cattle.  He invites the girls to the Oil Institute's Ball. <br /> <br />Shotzy winds up with JD.  Paula finds a Saudi oil man, Stuart. And Loco finds a married banker Mr. Brewster.  <br /> <br />Loco goes off for the weekend to Maine with Brewster thinking she is attending a lodge convention but its his hunting lodge.  She gets measles and is quarantined.   <br /> <br />While back in NYC, Freddie Dinmore (David Wayne) has snuck back from tax exile to get some papers out of the safe.  JD tells Shotzy that he is leaving.  But she tells him that she likes older men, \\"you know like that old guy in The African Queen.\\"   <br /> <br />Back in Maine, Loco is fine but now Brewster is sick.  She falls for theranger Evan (Rory Calhoun).  She thinks when he tells her, \\"all this is mine\\", that he owns the forest, not that he watches over it. <br /> <br />Freddie returns to the apartment and once again runs into Paula, who thinks he's Shotzy's friend.  Paula goes to Atlantic City to meet Stuart's mother.  On the airplane who sits next to her, Freddie! <br /> <br />Alone, Shotzy finally agrees to have dinner with Tom. And again and again but JD reappears and asks her to marry him.  Shotzy's dreams have come true.  At the wedding, Loco announces that she married Evan, the ranger.  Then Paula arrives and announces she married Freddie.  Shotzy gets to the alter, only to realize that she cannot marry for money and runs off with Tom.  It's only after all that, he lets her know how rich he is. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: <br />US, German and Italian Trailers <br /> <br />Restoration Comparison - Tells about the restoration of the Cinemascope print.

B00003ZKS1|5.0|A recording that will stand the test of time and serve as a reminder of just what a genius Schenker is with a Gibson Flying V.  A lot of my friends listened to this CD for the first time and simply said; \\"Holy smokes! Where did he come from?\\" I then tell them he recorded this 25 years ago and was way younger than most of them.  They were all utterly speechless and now are fans. <br /> <br />What a great solo effort and Schenker came out of the gates with guns ablazing.  Incredible material, song writing, production and performance by all band members.  Simon Phillips is a very talented drummer and lays down some serious tracks. <br /> <br />Highlight of this CD is the solo at the end of \\"Lost Horizons\\", that is mind boggling guitar work that is beyond replication. <br /> <br />This is a staple for anyone who follows extreme guitar talent and has an appreciation for master guitar work that will live on as long as music is played. <br /> <br />Awesome!
B00009RAJH|5.0|It might help to emphasize the greatness of this record by noting that I'm the last person on the world who should love it; my genres are classical, jazz, and to the extent that I enjoy pop/rock, my tastes go in the opposite direction from the folk-influenced pop that Fleetwood Mac did well.  If you buy a Fleetwood Mac album on Amazon (as I've discovered), the buying recommendations that start coming to you include James Taylor, the Eagles, Carly Simon, etc.  Completely not my thing.<br /><br />But hoo boy, is this a great record.  It deserves to be considered one of the all-time rock/pop classics, and in my opinion is greater than its heralded follow-up, Rumours.<br /><br />I base that on a view that the songs on this record are 1) just as catchy and infectious, but also 2) possessed of much greater emotional depth.<br /><br />Consider first Stevie Nicks's timeless \\"Landslide,\\" a poetic, haunting, acoustic jewel.  I don't know why this song doesn't routinely come up atop those \\"all time 100 greatest songs\\" lists, but it really deserves to.  It's hard to imagine a song that more beautifully captures the emotions it sings about:  big life changes, relationship dissolution, feeling uncertain and scared, and trying to find the courage to move forward.<br /><br />Immediately before \\"Landslide\\" on the record is another classic, Christine McVie's \\"Say You Love Me.\\"  It's basically a toe-tapping number good for singing along, but there's a subtext of poignancy to it that I've never been able to put my finger on. The lyrics don't really try to be profound.  But there's something about the way McVie, Buckingham and Nicks sing the choruses together, especially in combination with the roving bass, and especially in the fadeout. When they get to the end and are repeating, \\"Fallin', fallin', fallin'\\" in three-part harmony, it just feels perfection.<br /><br />And the album has other smash hits also:  \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Over My Head\\" among them.  \\"Over My Head\\" is prettier and more gentle in the album version than on the single version. \\"Rhiannon\\" isn't one of my favorite songs (I never really liked the whole Stevie Nicks persona where she seems to be narcissistically starring in her own fantasy novel) but it's an undeniably strong single.<br /><br />So there you have four timeless hit songs that are at least as strong as the four best songs on Rumours.  (Does anything on Rumours pack the emotional punch of \\"Landslide?\\").  But it's not just the headline numbers on this record but the supporting tunes that are fantastic.<br /><br />\\"Blue Letter\\" is a wonderful song, could easily have been a hit of its own (it sounds as though it influenced the composition of \\"Say You Love Me,\\" even on down to the affecting fadeout.)  \\"Monday Morning,\\" an energetic up-tempo number by Lindsey Buckingham, gets the album off to a terrific start.  \\"Crystal\\" is really a beautiful, emotional, poetic piece, composed by Stevie Nicks, sung mostly by Buckingham.  It's good for a lump in the throat; Nicks had a great gift for conveying powerful emotions in simple, understated composition.<br /><br />The six-song sequence that runs:  Blue Letter, Rhiannon, Over My Head, Crystal, Say You Love Me, and Landslide is about as strong a six-song run that any band has ever recorded (and the two that precede that run aren't bad either.)<br /><br />In sum, Fleetwood Mac is at their hit-making best on this record, but there is a poetry and emotional power to this music that you don't hear on their later recordings.  It paved the way for the phenomenal chart success of Rumours, but is in my opinion the greater of the two albums.ier and more gentle in the album version than on the single version. \\"Rhiannon\\" isn't one of my favorite songs (I never really liked the whole Stevie Nicks persona where she seems to be narcissistically starring in her own fantasy novel) but it's an undeniably strong single. <br /> <br />So there you have four timeless hit songs that are at least as strong as the four best songs on Rumours.

B00006FM77|5.0|I recieved this set for Christmas and am very impressed. I have the original Columbia cd set (which I thought was an improvement over the LPs) but this set even ecplises the Columbia cd release.  The sound quality is wonderful (the horns sound like horns and the mix is actually good).  The only improvement I can think if is maybe early versions of songs off chicago V, since the band did say they were doing new songs as well as songs from all three of the albums released to date.  All inserts are included, including smaller versions of all three posters and an expanded booklet.  BUY THIS SET!!
0142437611|4.0|I am a Bellow fan, read all of his novels, and wrote an Amazon guide: \\"A Guide to Reading Bellow.\\"<br /><br />The present book is not bad, but it is more of a novella, not one of his 300 page novels, and if you are interested in Bellow, there are many better books. If I had to recommend just one, it would be \\"Herzog.\\" Some of these novels have a warmth and charm, and have a certain tongue in cheek approach in describing the trials and tribulations of the narrator. The humour is mixed in with the meaning of our short lives, and the future of our souls. Bellow thought that the  development of realism was the major event of modern literature. That includes how we view subjects such as sex, life and death, etc. Having said that, there is not much humour in the present novel - and in some ways it is a step back for Bellow towards his first novel \\"Dangling Man.\\" The final scene has some elements - and it is a little more intense - than the award winning novel \\"Mr. Sammler's Planet\\" also by Bellow, but the present book is barely 100 pages. The book comes with a brief biography of Bellow that increases the page count to 144.<br /><br />In case you are new to Bellow, his novels reflect his life, his writings, and his five marriages during his five active decades of writing. He hit his peak as a writer around the time of \\"Augie March\\" in 1953 and continued through to the Pulitzer novel \\"Humbolt's Gift\\" in 1973. He wrote from the early 1940s through to 2000. His novels are written in a narrative form, and the main character is a Jewish male - usually a writer but not always - and he is living in either in New York or Chicago. Bellow wrote approximately 13 novels and a number of other works.<br /><br />Bellow's style progressed over the five decades. The early novels \\"Dangling Man\\" and \\"The Victim\\" were written in the 1940s, 20 years before his peak. Some compare his style in \\"Dangling Man\\" with Dostoevsky's \\"Notes from the Underground.\\" Changes in tempo and lightness could be seen in his second book \\"The Victim\\" in 1947. This carries on in his next book \\"The Adventures of Augie March\\" - his breakthrough book in 1953 that won a National Book Prize. The present books follows \\"Augie March.\\"<br /><br />That brings us to the present book whch is really one of his shorter novels. In fact, it is more of a novella similar to \\"The Actual\\" or the short story \\"What Kind of Day Did You Have?\\" from the collection \\"Him With Foot In Mouth and Other Stories.\\" The book is not a great example of Bellow's work and it is not the first or even the tenth Bellow novel that I would recommend. Simply put, he has too many other better books, especially starting with \\"Augie March\\" and going forward to \\"More Die of Heartbreak\\" or even his final novel \\"Ravelstein.\\" Yes, the writing is excellent, the story is interesting, but most Bellow fans will feel short changed.<br /><br />Bellow has three National book prizes for \\"Herzog,\\" \\"Mr.Sammler's Planet,\\" and \\"The Adventures of Augie March,\\" plus a Pulitzer Prize for or \\"Humbolt's Gift.\\" I would strongly recommend those reads. \\"Henderson The Rain King\\" is excellent for a change of pace.<br /><br />If you want to buy this novella, and some think it is among his best writing, it is available bundled with other short stories: ASIN: B0006AUNKQ\\"The Victim\\" in 1947.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|In the past, I was somewhat interested in this show, but I didn't really get into it until a close friend of mine bought on dvd and had a bunch of us watch it. And then I was hooked. This has to be one of the best shows ever. First of all, the characters are great. You have to love them all. The Tams are my favorites, hands down. But even the characters that appear less lovable, such as Jayne, have moments when you can't help but love them. Who can forget when Jayne got the letter and hat from his mother in The Message. Or when he... no wait. That would be a spoiler ^^ Anyway, moving on. The show also has great writing. It can be histerical at times, and extremely deep at others. To give an example of both, in Jaynestown Book walks in on River \\"fixing\\" his Bible. \\"Bible's broken. Contridictions, false logistics... Noah's Ark is a problem. We'll have to call it early quantum state phenominon. Only way to fit 5000 species of mammal on the same boat,\\" she say. Well, that may not be verbatim, but close enough. Another thing that is great about Firefly is that it creates a world that is completely believeable. It doesn't have technology that seems completely farfetched. They may be flying around on a spaceship, but that spaceship is literally a piece of junk. They love it anyway. It's kind of like how some people have cars that are on the verge of breaking down, but they don't replace it. Does that analogy work? <br /> <br />Anyway, this show is simply amazing. I suggest that you give it a try. <br /> <br />(by the way... watch more than just the first episode. while it does have some classic moments and gives you that background story, it's not one of my favorites. i still love it though ^^ just not as much as the others)
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I rarely find a movie I want to watch more than once, owning only 18 DVDs. This is one of those select few. It is not only a fantastic show in its own right, but it makes a highly satisfying wrap-up to the short-lived Firefly series. The entire original cast made the transformation from small to large screen and their chemistry has only gotten better over time. We find out the secrets of River's past, meet the dreaded Reavers, and uncover their mysterious history as well. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays one of the best \\"bad guys\\" ever filmed, an Alliance operative who's not truly evil, just overly dedicated and willing to do anything for his cause. The special effects truly complement the story line yet don't steal the show as they do in many sci-fi productions. Everything from the costumes, sets, props, and effects blend together seamlessly to make this future verse believable.<br /><br />The only shortcoming is the bonus material, which is far to short and adds little to the viewing experience. The deleted scenes don't add a lot to the story line, though the outtakes are funny. Re-igniting the Firefly is the best segment of the extra stuff. Be that as it may, the movie is well written, brilliantly acted, and thoroughly enjoyable. I saw Serenity in the theatre and then found out about the Firefly TV series, which I subsequently purchased for myself. I bought the movie as soon as it became available and have watched it several times since. I truly hope they make a sequal.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Great album. Their best album so far.
B00012BD0S|5.0|The Divine Wings of Tragedy is quite possibly the greatest progressive metal album I have ever heard.  I have been listening to metal (in various tweaked subgenres) for several years now, and when I found Symphony X, there was no going back.  At first my interests were curbed toward a more mainstream approach, such as the works of Metallica, but I soon was introduced to The Odyssey (the most current Symphony X release to date--also a 5-star work) and have not moved Symphony X out of my own personal #1 slot.  This album is so complete and so absolutely incredible that anything more would have made these men (Michael Romeo, Russell Allen, Michael Pinella, Michael Lepond, and James Rullo) proverbial gods of 'prog.'  My favorite track has shifted from time to time (I've been listening to this CD for years and it's still got its kick), but among the best is \\"The Divine Wings of Tragedy,\\" which is an apocalyptically driven 20-minute suite that is beyond words for description, from the well-orchestrated (and I should know, being myself an accomplished musician) choir segment to the final hits in the vein of Holst; \\"Of Sins and Shadows,\\" \\"The Eyes of Medusa,\\" \\"Out of the Ashes,\\" \\"Candlelight Fantasia,\\" and \\"The Witching Hour\\" are all incredible also.  This album has beautiful contrast, while still managing to drop your jaw at least once in a song.  The talent that Romeo and Pinella display in the first track is inspiring.  There really is no better way to kick off a progressive metal album than with shredding of the most exact degree.  And of course, they keep on providing this virtuosic performance with great speed and lush vocal melodies until they approach \\"The Accolade.\\"  This song is a bit more than a touch of power metal, but the way it's done really detracts absolutely nothing from the beautiful voice of Allen.  From singing of the mighty soldier to the pharoh, his voice is unfaltering, passionate, and powerful (it's that way live, too).  Instrumentally, the group delivers, as I have already said (but this is worth repeating), a breathtaking and incredible performance, with beauty in the soft and relaxing melodies of \\"Candlelight Fantasia\\" and yet brawn \\"The Eyes of Medusa.\\"  If you have to choose one track on this album, the title track is the way to go.  It just may be the best 20 minutes and 42 seconds of your day.  Trust me, my musical tastes (among types of metal) are constantly ephemeral, yet Symphony X never disappoints.  I would dare go so far as to recommend this album as the best ever made.    -A. Carlson (pianist, guitarist, etc.)
B000AP04FG|5.0|Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a great movie for those who love action and also for those who love comedy! for me it was an amazing movie because i love both. it was fun to watch that movie, it`s funny, but it also keep you on your nerves, because you want to know what`ll happen next! <br />anyway, i really recomend it to everybody! <br />keep watching :)
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|Man, this is a bummer. Somehow, while searching for a new sound after their last record got critically panned (and didn't sell), the Strokes forgot how to write great songs. This new record is a mish mash of aggressive riffs, while Julian C mumbles and yells over it, trying desperately to sound like vintage Iggy Pop. I was totally underwhelmed by the first single \\"Juicebox\\" released a couple of months ago, and it turns out to be one of the few memorable tunes on the album.<br /><br />Gone are the hooks of the first 2 records. Some people will call this progress and suggest that the band has grown, gotten more rock and roll. Poppycock. There is not a tune on this record anywhere near as great as \\"Barely Legal\\" off the first record, or even as good as \\"You Talk Way Too Much\\" or \\"The End Has No End\\" off Room On Fire.<br /><br />I absolutely love this band and have all their singles, EPs, etc. I was amped for this record. But this is a bummer, and NOT the record they needed to make. Sure, they needed to change their sound, but they threw the baby out with the bathwater - the songs will likely get little airplay, and I'd bet their label drops them after this record, that is if they stay together.\\"First Impressions\\" is a misstep - the Strokes might think they're the Velvet Undergound, or Television, or on this record, Iggy and The Stooges, but they're really just a Y2K version of The Cars, and now they've forgotten how to write songs.<br /><br />One one of the songs, Julian C. repeats over and over \\"I have nothing to say\\". Sadly, it's the one thing he sings on this record that sounds like he actually means it.
B000AP04FG|3.0|\\"How many times hav-\\"<br /><br />\\"Ten.\\"<br /><br />- Ten is the magic number for \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\"<br /><br />\\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" is one of those action films that survives on one thing - it's stars.<br /><br />The film opens with Mr. & Mrs. Smith in there first session of marriage counseling. The couple have been married for 5 to 6 years. They met in a third-world country, got married right off & had a happy homelife, at first. But with the ensuing years they both slowly became distant, succumbing to there hum-drum lifestyle.<br /><br />Business picks up when both of them find out a dark secret. Each of them is a trained assasin, working for competing firms. Of course both of them are angry at each other for not telling the other about this & what's worse their latest hit is each other. After the Smith's try to off each other unsuccessfully they decide to team up & figure out how to get out of the mess their in.<br /><br />\\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" reminded ao much of the James Cameron film \\"True Lies\\" that I was waiting for the Govenator to make a guest appearance. From the dancing scene to Vince Vaughn's funny sidekick, I couldn't help but think that this must have been an early draft for \\"True Lies 2\\".<br /><br />The action scenes are pretty cartoonish & aren't to believable (that's an ongoing problem with action films today the bigger the bang the more unbelievable it is).<br /><br />Pitt & Jolie are fun to watch & are what make \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" worth the rent. Sadly, I can smell a sequel coming.
038572179X|5.0|This novel was masterfully written, evocative and compelling--it makes me truly hopeful about modern fiction.  I was initially worried that it might be slow due to other reviewers' comments, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was not.  Ian McEwan has composed a perfect snapshot of a pre-WWII English aristocratic family, its petty and actual dramas, and its eventual disintegration.   <br /> <br />The novel opens focusing on Briony Tallis, an imaginative and capricious (and immature) 13-year-old.  McEwan convincingly writes how a naive dreamer such as Briony could completely misinterpret an adult situation, leading to the downfall of others in a horribly unjust way.  The novel's scope grows to embrace a love story between Robbie, the son of a Tallis servant, and Cecilia, Briony's older sister, as well as a war story for Robbie, who finds himself in France.   <br /> <br />This novel is restrained and yet completely full of emotion.  It is extremely well plotted and written, and even the \\"slow\\" parts have their purpose.  I agree with some of the other reviewers who believe this book can become a classic.  Do not pass up this wonderful book.
B000148KK2|4.0|Wonderful, wonderful music. Hard to say which track would be my favorite, as that changes from time to time (they are all very good). I suppose I find myself returning most often to Diana's cover of \\"Black Crow\\".<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0805076476|5.0|\\"You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.\\" <br /> <br />Fight Club, starting with an idea and ending with an anarchy army, is provocative, revolutionary debut by author Chuck Palahniuk. With impressive attention to detail and a thought provoking gripping storyline, Fight Club is one of the most influential stories of the decade. Creating numerous real Fight Clubs across the country and affecting other \\"clubs\\" with similar rules, in addition to shedding light on real waiters who, like in the story, tainted food at expensive restaurants, as mentioned in the afterward in some editions, Fight Club definitely earns the reputation of being a most influential book that has affected people worldwide. <br /> <br />\\"You are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.\\" <br /> <br />Fight Club provides an interesting outlook on the society we live in today. Palahniuk's dark humor and style of writing may not be appealing to those of a younger audience or those faint of heart, but, being an exhilarating read and realistic writing, Palahniuk's novel is an amazing read coupled with some chillingly realistic actions that may keep people away from certain things. For example, one might never eat at an expensive restaurant again after reading this novel. <br /> <br />\\"We are all part of the same human compost pile.\\" <br /> <br />Fight Club is one of those successes that everyone may find enjoyable. However, the novel is tilted toward older audiences and the occasional obscene language may make this novel unsuitable for younger readers. <br /> <br />Overall, an exciting read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show had it all, a great cast, great acting, funny and smart with enough action and space thrills to satisfy almost any sci-fi enthusiast. Again Fox has proven how stupid they can be for not giving the show the chance it deserved, like Family Guy they canceled a show that had a true and loyal following. At least they saw the light and brought Family Guy back, maybe they should give Firefly another shot. On the other hand I think Whedon should stick it to them by make a few more movies. In any case a great show and very enjoyable, and they movie was just as good, well done Whedon, well done!
B00005JKNF|5.0|Well so am I! That's why this movie was such a great pleasure to watch. Gosford Park is a murder mystery set in a countryside mansion in England. I read in a previous review that the movie is dumb and predictable. Obviously, that reviewer prefers SMART and non-formula movies like 'Stealth'! PUH-LEASE!      Gosford Park is EXCELLENTLY scripted, and is not a typical Hollywood-type mystery at all. It will have you TRULY guessing until the very end. In addition, the cast is AMAZING, and the acting is beyond first-rate. Do not expect lame unrealistic Hollywood-type action scenes. This movie portrays the aftermath of a murder pretty realistically. Gosford Park makes my all-time Top 10 Movies list.     More than likely, if you love the yearly 'summer blockbuster' that Hollywood churns out (again, like 'Stealth'), you are a lemming, and will think Gosford Park is boring. You will not like it. However, if you hate how many dumb movies Hollywood makes these days, then give Gosford Park a try. You WILL love this movie.     One final note: The movie is set in England, and utilizes English and Scottish actors, complete with real accents. If you find it hard to understand accents, you may find it helpful to watch the movie with the subtitles on, as the soundtrack has a very real-life feel to it, with many conversations overlapping each other. The subtitles are quite good, and will help you hear all the nuances of the coversations.       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B00003CXSP|1.0|I read the book - this junk bore little resemblance. The poor treatment of the subject matter made the tense scenarios that thrilled me in the book into laughably vague and sometimes unbelieveble scenes in the movie. And our dear Mr. Hopkins played it a bit too sinister this time around. Would Dr. Lecter behave so obviously when he was trying to evade capture?? Disappointing.
B000AMPZGC|5.0|I hadn't seen A Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, or much other than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory before I was introduced to Danny Elfman. I'm glad I went and saw Corpse Bride because with the opening song, I knew the soundtrack was going to be perfect for the movie. The Piano Duet is my favorite on the whole CD. I turned to my friend in the theater and said,\\"I'm getting the soundtrack just for that song\\". Unfortunetely I haven't been able to do so yet, but I will be soon. Most of the sountracks have been sold out so I haven't been able to buy it and felt that waiting a few days was simply too long. Then I forgot about it. Until now. It's an awesome soundtrack, don't miss an opportunity to hear excellent piano and synthesizer sounds mixed with some New Orleans style jazz.
0684824906|5.0|For those familiar with the Lincoln tales, you will find many of the great stories here.  His abilites to appease and negotiate and get himself out of bind are legendary, and many of the often quoted tales are here.  The nice thing about the book is the focus on the members of the cabinet, not only from a story telling perspective, but from the POV of getting new source material.  Chase's daughter, Seward's Wife, etc.  Using their letters/diaries, etc. give new intrepretation if not just new information to a very complex man who is probably our greatest president ever.  <br /> <br />I found this book a very easy read and even at 700 pages, finished it in about a week.  It is a wonderful look at what Lincoln did best.  Lincoln understood early on that he did not have all the answers and this would be a working, learning process.  So why not surround yourself with people of different points of view?  It is great contrast to today's society of \\"Yes\\" people who simply nod their heads to everything their boss has to say.  This goes for the corporate world as well as politics. <br /> <br />Lincoln had many heated discussions and debates about which way to go on many issues--Emmancipation, selection of generals, Fort Sumter, etc.  The author does an excellent job of showing who stood where and from where Lincoln drew his advice and made his decisions. <br /> <br />For me the book was a perfect balance of biography (again, keep in mind, not just on Lincoln but on the various cabinet members) and the times they lived in.  I would have liked to have seen a little more analysis, but then I guess the book becomes biased.  So in the least it is a very neutral telling of probably the most fascinating times in our country's history. <br /> <br />For those interested further in the civil war, there is no better than Shelby Foote's trilogy.  He is also a big Lincoln fan and you will find a lot of the Lincoln stories in his trilogy (albeit, in less detail).
B000AMJDHY|3.0|My roommate first discovered Panic! and when he was playing their songs, I naturally asked if Fall Out Boy came out with some new singles.  I wasn't aware this band even existed, but they sound so damn similar, that's there's almost no discernable difference.  The singer sounds the same, the composition of songs is nearly identical, and the lyrics are written and sung in the same style.  That's not necessarily bad...I mean, I enjoy listening to Fall Out Boy from time to time.  They're not the greatest to me, but I like them. <br /> <br />Moving right along though.  Panic! falls short of even being compared to being close in quality of Fall Out Boy.  For one, listening to a lot of songs, they seem to not be able to grasp the concept of time signature or tempo for that matter.  Changing time signatures can be really cool, when done right, but when they do it, it just doesn't flow.  And the singer, even though he sounds like the Fall Out Boy guy, there's absolutely no contest.  He basically sounds like an untrained version.  His vibrato is out of control in a lot of places, and he jumps between notes like he was hyped up on heroin and jumping from cloud to cloud.   <br /> <br />This band...they're just alright.
0345475674|4.0|I originally purchased this book purely due to its subject matter, without having much of an idea of the plotline, and was very pleasantly surprised by a thoroughly enjoyable read set in one of my favourite historical periods.  <br /> <br />Robert Harris has delivered a fast paced read which, while giving you an insight into the times and events, does not get too bogged down in the details, instead allowing the action and adventures of the characters to also describe the environment and times in which they are set.The whole time I was reading, I found myself imagining how this book would look as a motion picture, even to the point where I would fantasize on the drive to work about how I could get the word out to movie producers out there. <br /> <br />Originally doubting Harris' ability to maintain suspense considering most readers would know that the mountain explodes at the end (hope I didn't give too much away), I found to the contrary, that knowing how it all ended actually increased the suspense, because you knew that death & destruction were waiting just around the corner. <br /> <br />All in all, Pompeii is a thoroughly enjoyable read which I would recommend to anyone with even a passing interest in the Roman era, Vulcanology, Hydrology or a good action/suspense book.  <br /> <br />
B0007OY2P8|2.0|For those who have in fact read the book, you can find some redeeming qualities in this movie - most of them found with Katherine Schlesinger, who along with Peter Firth, pull of their characters most true to what one would envision. <br /> <br />However, it does in fact neglect the many nuances of the story which make Catherine the true heroine at the end of the novel, and the 'daydreams' she has of the Mysteries of Udolpho are really far and away over the top.  While John Thorpe is cast well, I have to agree with other reviewers that 1) his part is definitely underused, and 2) that he comes off as being mean spirited, instead of goofy and bumbling...  Isabella is horribly cast, and, while you aren't supposed to love her from the beginning in the novel, in the movie you definitely can't even understand why Catherine would become friends with this young woman, and it thus implies a love for her brother that is willing to overlook such vulgarity, instead of showing that she is really and truly the dupe of Isabella and her 'sincere' regard for her and her brother... <br /> <br />Also, I didn't think that the introduction of a 'gambling' problem and financial troubles in the life of General Tilney was necessary, since it is the pride of his character which causes him to act towards Catherine as he does....  <br /> <br />And I must confess, that with the way that the 'daydream' sequences were interspersed throughout the film, I honestly did not realize that the end of the movie was supposed to be the reality of Catherine's life, and not a daydream....  It made me laugh out loud instead of feeling the justice of the ending... <br /> <br />Overall, if it hadn't been for the acting of Katherine Schlesinger and Peter Firth, it really would have been disappointing to have actually paid for this movie.... As it is, it is so far over the top and barely stays true to the book that, if you are a Jane Austin purist, this movie will revolt you to your core.  However, if you are willing to give it a try, it will undoubtedly make you laugh, and there are redeeming moments in the movie (not many) which make the barely 90 minute flick worth sitting through.
B0009WFFS6|3.0|Listening to Cream in the 1960's was one of the driving reasons I took up playing guitar and still love playing it today. The expressiveness, tone and sheer beauty of the solos Clapton played during that time were out of this world. Fast forward to May 2005 and it is almost as if Clapton had forgotten how he used to play these songs. The solos on almost every song were reduced to blues-box scales which could hardly be glorified as improvisation. Despite the huge back-line of amps the tone of his Fender Stratocaster just didn't cut it like his SG and ES 335 Gibsons did in the '60's. In \\"White Room\\" he couldn't even be bothered plugging in the wah-wah pedal to try and recreate the magic of that solo! In \\"Sweet Wine\\" his solo was weak and uninspiring, whereas in the original his phrasing and tone just soared. I almost felt that his approach to most of the songs was \\"let's just get the chords OK and remember the words and harmony and everything else will take care of itself\\". However on the alternate take of \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" he even forgot his opening lines and Jack Bruce had to fill in. These are the hallmarks of a lazy pub band who don't take their job seriously! One reviewer felt the rendition of \\"Badge\\" was sublime; well for me it left me cold, because once again EC could not reproduce the emotion of that solo which quite frankly every time I hear it, I get goose-bumps.<br /><br />So if you are buying this DVD to listen to great guitar playing, save your money and get the original Cream CD's.<br /><br />On the positive side, Jack Bruce's inventive bass lines and Ginger Baker's jazz-inspired drumming have not lost any of their punch in nearly 40 years. Similarly, both Clapton and Bruce's vocals were as strong (in Clapton's case, stronger) as they were on the original recordings. The overall production quality of the DVD is very good, however on the alternate take of \\"Sunshine of your Love\\", one of Ginger's tom-toms had an annoying low frequency resonating boom which tended to over-power the mix. One other criticism - and it wouldn't have rated a mention had I not been so disappointed with the guitar playing - but why did the producers deem it necessary to scan the audience and focus on all the big faces in showbiz who were in attendance? Did they feel it was necessary to somehow underline the importance of this concert? For God's sake, Jude Law wasn't even born when Cream were at their peak! Such obsequiousness was totally out of place at a concert like this and quite unnecessary. Save this for productions like the Oscars.<br /><br />Look, I loved these guys and their music. Their output was relatively small but awesome in its quality. Therefore I would have thought they could have tried harder to re-create the memory for those of us old enough to be so inspired by their breakthrough music in those heady days. It is so disappointing because, had Eric put as much effort into this reunion as he did for his CrossRoads Guitar Festival, (which is one of the finest guitar DVD's on the market), then this Cream DVD would be a \\"must have\\".g boom which tended to over-power the mix.

B0001XAS1W|4.0|This was one of the first cassettes in my collection back in the 70's, and receiving the CD for Christmas was one of the best presents I could have gotten.  It's a funny thing: there's nothing groundbreaking in the music or production, and yet it gets in your psyche, curls up in a corner that becomes its own, and becomes part of yourself you wondered how you ever lived without -- which is how cat owners often describe their pets.  Another incredible mastering job by Rhino.  Also: I used to think of this as Al's \\"Spanish\\" album, not because of the song styles, but because he manages to use the word \\"Spanish\\" in the first three songs on the disc, even though they're all very different from one another.  Who else could pull that off?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The phrase, \\"Once in a lifetime,\\" is used a bit too liberally for my taste.  One statement should never be so...absolute, but if given as a genuine acknowledgement of a life changing moment or event, it carries the most emotional weight of any label in the English language.   <br /> <br />Firefly/Serenity encapsulates the essence of a \\"once in a lifetime\\" experience.  I am not exaggerating my praise, or using hyperbole to \\"hype\\" a defunct show.  My adoration of this tale supersedes any and all that have come before it (take that Mr. Lucas). <br /> <br />Were I capable of describing the narrative perfection of this tale...I still wouldn't.  Firefly must be witnessed first hand, and your own emotions and conclusions must be formed and made.   <br /> <br />Whatever brought you to this place and made you read this footnote of a fan, let it guide you.  You don't need to be a flag waving science fiction fan or a \\"chew spittin\\" Western fan to enjoy this series...you need only be a person waiting to be entertained. <br /> <br />If you are such a person, board the Firefly freighter Serenity and love her crew...at least once this lifetime.
B000007492|4.0|I have been somewhat of a fan of Supertramp since the mid 70's.  Their brand of pop/art rock is quite catchy.  This collection has most of their good songs on it!  My particuliar favorites are Goodbye Stranger, Take The Long Way Home, and Dreamer.  The production quality is good...Buy it if you want to hear some of their classic songs!!
B00011F5DK|5.0|There's some kind of appeal to finding a good fit, like in jigsaw puzzles or Tetris.    We (parents and kids aged 9 and 11) try to find time to play at least once each day, and with each game taking <30 mins, we can usually squeeze one in.  Games are more interesting with 4 players.    Pros/Neutrals:  1. Few rules, easy to learn (even my 4-yr-old plays with us)  2. Quick games  3. Purely strategic play  4. Although it's all plastic, it seems well constructed (even the cardboard box it comes in)  5. Should appeal to a wide range of ages.  Can see playing this with just adults.    Cons:  1.  Lots of small pieces that might get lost depending on how well you care for your games    Will be looking for a travel version.
B00005JO1Y|2.0|I was kind of dragged to this movie, and have to say that had I been alone, I would have left halfway through.  The special effects were ridiculous (come on, the girl was flung around like a rag doll and not one bruise on her body? And don't get me started on the dinosaur stampede...).  Most of the special effects besides Kong were very obvious, and there was an overabundance of huge, creepy creatures that would only attack once the actors woke up.  The only redeeming quality of this movie was the relationship between King Kong and Naomi Watts' character.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This has got to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  I swear, when I saw it in the theater I thought it was great but it's been on cable for the past few months like every day and I've watched it three times already and just can't get enough of it.  Will Ferrall is HISTARICAL, the funniest I've seen him I swear and Stiller is great as is Wilson who I'm not a big fan of, but in this movie he is freaking hilarious.  I just have to say that this has got to be one of the best comedy/spoofs I've ever seen and is a must see for any Stiller fan.  This is a gem!
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I, like others, caught the Hammersmith show on PBS.<br /><br />While I was born and raised in NJ, as a black man, Bruce just was not on the radar for me, ya know?  I grew up on hip-hop and R&B.  I respected Bruce, but never really GOT IT.<br /><br />Hokay.....I get it! Twentysomething Bruce and the E-Street Band, that is what I needed to see.<br /><br />WHAT A SHOW!  I watched it three times this holiday season.<br /><br />Great musicians, great songs, great venue.  Wow.<br /><br />If you are a fan of live music and musicianship, you gotta see this DVD.  One of THEE live rock and roll concerts of all time, right here.
B000B8QF00|4.0|I have been a major fan of Alanis from as far back as I remember- matter of fact one of my first few loved c.d.s was Alanis' Jagged Little Pill. I grew up on those songs and got the Collection for two reasons- One because my Jagged album was getting pretty worn out from playing it over the years and this Collection has many of the good songs from Jagged and also because of Seal's song Crazy she does a cover for. I actually like her version of the song Crazy better than his- I just like her singing it better.  <br />The Collection also has a few other songs off of here not from Jagged I enjoyed hearing which makes this a very worthwhile album. <br /> <br />Why it doesn't get five stars? Because I felt in one or two places there could have been put a better song- like I miss her song All I Really Want off of Jagged- I mean that song was great and I think it should have been on there. And also there are about three tracks I dislike on her, unfortunately.  <br />Like Let's Do It- definitely not a favorite for me. I really do not get into this song, especially coming from Alanis. Mercy is another song I skip all the time. I just do not like those sort of Alanis songs. I enjoy her in her rock mode, I want to hear her there. Sister Blister, although I hear a favorite, is not a song I got into either, although I don't mind it.  <br /> <br />So aside from only a few weak tracks on here, I still love the majority of the songs. Alanis has been a music idol for a long time for me- she got me away from sugar pop and got me into real and introspective music, for Alanis is herself real and honestly introspective. I cannot wait to hear more from Alanis- for this Collection is indeed not the end at all for her, just an 18- track walk down memory lane to see how far she has come, and she has come a long and successful way indeed. <br /> <br />My favorite song of all time I am glad she put on the Collection is You Learn. My next favorites after You Learn are Thank You, Crazy, Ironic,You Oughta Know, Simple Together, That I Would Be Good, Uninvited, and Hand In My Pocket.

B00005JO1Y|1.0|Peter Jackson simply decided to do another Lord of the Rings movie.   Every element found here is found in Lord of the Rings.   <br /> <br />They travel by boat quite a bit.  The characters are on a long journey to a far off land: sound like The Fellowship of the Ring?   <br /> <br />Skull Island is Mordor.   <br /> <br />The island's natives are just like the orcs.   <br /> <br />The dinosaurs and other creatures are just like the Nazgul creatures.   <br />' <br />King Kong is the just like the ring; he's deadly, but you feel lured in by him in some way.   <br /> <br />Like the Ring, people are captivated by him, but they know deep down he has to be destroyed.   <br /> <br />Just a retread of Jackson's earlier work.   <br /> <br />The CGI?  It looks like CGI, and not very good at that.  <br /> <br />This kind of computer animation is  a throwback to films from the 1980s, like the Disney film TRON.    <br /> <br />A definite thumbs down.

The songs are all so interesting and different from the next.  <br /> <br />1.My Name is Jonas: great song, with better chorus <br />2.No One Else: \\"Weakness\\" of album but still not bad, acoustic version is amazing though. <br />3.The World Has Turned and Left Me Here: good song about a broken relationship. <br />4.Buddy Holly: Still a classic, catchy and up-tempo, video won multiple awards <br />5.Undone-The Sweater Song: One of my favorite songs of all time, with phenomenal lyrics. <br />6.Surf Wax America- fast paced, good but not great <br />7.Say It Ain't So- great song, underrated, good lyrics <br />8.In The Garage- nerdy, about insecurity and growing up in a garage band, but a very good song, improved by opening harmonica. <br />9.Holiday: Song that turned me on to the album, much much better than Green Days Holiday. <br />10.Only in Dreams: Long but extremely good, great bass, about trying to get the girl whos out of ur league.

B000B8QF14|5.0|Note: I received the Bullet in a Bible DVD, but not the live CD that accompanies it for review. The CD is the band's entire live performance of twenty songs. This review pertains strictly to the 115-minute DVD.<br /><br />One of the band members asks a rhetorical question during some of the backstage footage, and it pretty well sums up the world's view of Green Day. \\"Why are there no clouds in the sky?\\" he asks. \\"Because God<br /><br />wants to watch his favorite band again.\\" Bullet in a Bible is quite possibly the thing that Green Day fans across the planet have been waiting sixteen years for. Here we have a band that has been around longer than many of their fans are old, and they're rocking even harder than they did way back when. Bullet is a look at Green Day's two performances in the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England on June 18th and 19th. They played to 130,000 fans in the two days, hailed as their biggest shows ever. The DVD covers the majority of the band's set and sprinkles in interviews with Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals, guitar), Mike Dirnt (bass), and Tr&eacute; Cool (drums). The CD has the complete set, sans the interviews. It's a quite nice balance for any fan.<br /><br />In the first half-hour of the DVD, the production is admittedly a bit annoying. With the camera switching, the viewer feels like he or she is in a state of sensory overload. They rotate between band members, helicopters, pit cameras, and even color versus black and white in a span of seconds. Luckily this irritating problem seems to remedy itself as the DVD continues-either that or one gets used to it.<br /><br />For those wondering exactly how the DVD earned its name, there is an interview with the band at the Imperial War Museum. They walk through the museum, and one of the employees points out a Bible indeed with a bullet through it. This is one of a number of mini-features that divide up Bullet in a Bible and the bands song performances. Sometimes they're just simple interviews with the members about the upcoming song or the album or touring, and other times they're truly a behind-the-scenes look at Green Day. Drummer Tr&eacute; Cool comes off as an utter goofball with his Mountie uniform and hat during the interview sessions, while Billie Joe is the focused, serious one. Mike Dirnt is most definitely the rose between two thorns. Tr&eacute;, in one interview explains, \\"I can count to four and repeat. I'm a drummer.\\" Armstrong later in the performance refers to him as \\"the best drummer in the history of rock `n roll.\\" While these two statements are polar opposites on the exaggeration scale, he is one of my favorite drummers of all time. He's the real deal-talented, charismatic, and absolutely priceless.<br /><br />The DVD has something for all walks of Green Day fans. Plenty of American Idiot finds its way into the setlist, but old favorites such as \\"Longview,\\" \\"Basket Case,\\" and \\"Minority\\" don't disappoint. In fact, in the years since the older songs came out, their live performance of them gives the songs a whole new life. No longer is Billie Joe Armstrong the fresh-faced kid singing about masturbation. He's the nearly middle-aged man singing about masturbation. That's the thing about Green Day; they transcend generations. During a featurette on the band's slightly nutty English fans, one mother tells the camera how her daughter grew up listening to the band because she's been a fan for so long. Their shows aren't just concerts; they're events.<br /><br />Having seen one of the later dates on this tour when they came to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, I did have a bit of insight into their setlist and performance before watching Bullet in a Bible. Some might be disappointed to hear this, but Green Day choreographs 99.8 percent of their stage show, and their setlists are just about rock-solid. That means that at times the DVD comes off as overly theatrical if you've seen them on the American Idiot World Tour. What it does offer is a chance tosee the band close up. You can watch the sweat pour from the band members' faces as they power through a roughly 90 minute set. You get to see Tr&eacute; Cool's wacky facial expressions and drumstick tosses-all 100 or so of them. For those of us who didn't have front row seats, this was a fantastic opportunity to see them like never before.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Bullet in a Bible; it's definitely a good way to spend some hard-earned cash, especially if you've never seen Green Day live. They're spectacular and just about flawless. If you can sit down and devote just under two hours to this DVD, it's worth picking up. Green Day has been around 16 years, and with performances like this, they should have no problem doing another 16.band close up.

B0002VKZL6|2.0|I'm a HUGE Knopfler fan, I own almost everything he's put out but I wish I hadn't bought this album. While I respect his \\"I don't have anything to prove\\" approach to his guitar solos on his past few albums I felt that this one was lacking too much in the area of guitar playing. He's trying to be a singer/songwriter on this one, and while he's good enough in that respect, he is first and foremost a GUITAR GOD and his work should reflect this.    As for the songs themselves only a few were able to really grab me. \\"Postcards\\", \\"Donegan's Gone and Don't Crash the Ambulance\\" were the best; \\"Back to Tupelo\\", \\"Whoop de Doo\\", \\"Sucker Row\\", \\"All That Matters\\" and \\"Stand up Guy\\" were all right; and the rest of the album didn't really do it for me. I didn't like \\"Boom, Like That\\" because of the subject - who writes a song about McDonalds??? BORING. Although I will give him credit for originality.    I'm sure the long-time fans will get something from this album, but if you're new to Knopfler's solo career pick up \\"Golden Heart\\" first. This is a far cry from the Dire Straits days.    (Edit) in response to Drew Vics' review: I could not agree with you more sir, when you say \\"MK sounds like MK and DS sounds like DS\\". My review, however, was written in response to the Amazon.com product description declaring this to be Knopfler's \\"most rocking album since his halcyon days in Dire Straits\\", which is quite clearly not true (with the possible exception of \\"BLT\\"). As I said before, \\"Golden Heart\\" is a much better place to start if you're looking for Knopfler sounding like Dire Straits.
B000007492|5.0|I was a fan of Supertramp in the late 70s, especially due to their Breakfast in America album that got non-stop radio airplay in 1979 and later.  It seemed that everyone loved Supertramp. <br /> <br />For some strange reason, I just recently became interested in them again after really not knowing what had become of them for the past 20 years.  Putting in their Greatest Hits cd reminded me of why they were so great. They had a unique sound, extremely catchy melodies, identifiable and signature keyboard sound, interesting, quirky, whimsical and intelligent lyrics and a unique voice in Roger Hodgson.  I remember that during the 70's they were subject to much ridicule because they were considered to pop or \\"soft\\" and because some felt that they had become too successful.   <br /> <br />Bands like Supertramp, Journey and Styx were all put in the same category and tagged as \\"supergroups\\", \\"stadium rock\\" and a number of other labels that were meant to be slightly derogatory. I am a fan of Journey and Styx, but any listen to this Greatest Hits cd and you will soon realize that Supertramp is in a category by themselves: their lyrics were much more interesting and intelligent and their music took the best from prog-rock and pop and mixed both into a unique formula.  They sound like nobody else.   <br /> <br />I miss the days when Supertramp were king.  It would be great to hear bands these days that can play, have interesting lyrics and great melodic hooks.  This cd reminds you why they were so great.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This miniseries has a bit of everything - great action, beautiful scenery, romance, wonderful bonds of friendship.  It's quite a journey & very entertaining all the way through.  Robert Duvall is an amazing actor.  Gus was a great character - very funny & real.  Robert had such a gift of bringing him to life & I really enjoyed every scene he was in.  The whole cast worked great together.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|i asked for this movie for Christmas, specifically to see alan rickman.  i was highly disappointed to see him play a middle aged man with a wife of 13 years and 2 school age children who decides one night in the sack is worth a $500.00 gold necklace -which he gives to his secretary of just a few weeks(while he gives his wife a cd)-and his family life - this is a comedy??!! <br /> <br />mr. rickman is much too good an actor to settle for this dribble of a part! now, if you want to see him at his recent best-check out the first harry potter movie where he plays severus snape, potions master and spy, in a subtle, sexy performance.
0679422714|3.0|It's true, Jung Chang's fearsome contempt for Mao is a shadow that never leaves this book. I wish she had tempered that, but I suppose she's a right to her demons. She writes as beautifully here as she did in Wild Swans, and it adds a certain delicacy to a bewilderingly pungent story. I'm not sure how 'unknown' the story of Mao is; his is a history of power that parallels other Leaders, even those of the so-called free world. The great helmsmen of the West use violence of another kind, but altogether similarly destructive and unoriginal. No, it's the personal Mao that catches Chang's eye - his sloth, his betrayal of his wives, the perpetual recrudescence of his devouring sexual appetite, his habits of hygiene, or lack of them. Near fetishistic appears her willingness to jump from dirty black teeth to dirty black heart, but I exaggerate. Jung Chang exaggerates, and she shouldn't, but she's written a heck of a book. True, a part of her 'research' flows through her veins, and while a personal stake in the book's resolving theses is convenient, it taints but cannot obliterate some surprisingly convincing scholarship. To suggest less is an unfair bias. Chang's Mao is no prism. Her Mao is evil, which is to say, astringent. Even his poems are bad. But, for me, there's a wholeness to Chang's survival that recommends the book, and makes it worthwhile. If the book is far less than perfect, even if, in the end, it's but a book necessary to have been written, it's arguable that that's sufficient. Don't get your history here, but let one of history's plainly gifted witnesses brilliantly spin a riveting tale.
0553573403|5.0|I was in the library and I saw the cover for the book a Feast for crows. I had never heard of George R.R. Martin, let alone his Song of Ice and Fires Books. I didn't want to read this one until I had read the others. So So glad I did, Great books as soon as I finished this one I had to have the other in hand and ready to go. Reading this way better than watching TV however it is similar to watching TV because of the characters and the things that are happening. Loved this book!
B00005YXZH|5.0|This album is perfect.  Before listening to this album, I had never heard of Wilco.  Now they are one of my favorite bands ever.  This album is not commercially accessable and it shouldnt, because commercial music sucks.  From start to finish it is amazing.  Everything comes together perfectly.  This is truly on of the best records of my lifetime.
055357342X|5.0|We continue with the Song of Ice and Fire books, however, before, I didn't mention my girl Daney, Queen of the Dragons, I literally mean dragons! The fire breathing kind. Yo, she is only 13 years old and running things. She has her on Dragon riders, knights, and a slew full of mean fighting machines call Eunuchs, who have all dedicated their lives to her. She started out with nothing but a horse, a bunch of starving slaves and three dragons.  She now has her own Kingdom and is about to get busy and grab another kingdom before long. When I tell you that this book is great, really good.<br /><br />Arya, Tyrion, and Jon Snow are my favs. Tyrion has killed his lying good for nothing father, I was hopeing he could have killed his lying good for nothing, trifling sister as well...next time. How many of you were sad when the hound got his just reward? Me either! ha Ha, and it was so cool how Arya just left him dying under that tree. I love her, she is just so smooth at age 11.<br /><br />You just don't know how I cheered when Joffery was killed and that stupid Lisa Arryn.<br /><br />Jon Snow gave up being Lord of Winterfell to continue on with the men in black. I wanted him to be Lord but Jon is learing what's best for Jon.<br /><br />Anyway, I am about to read the 4th book in the series. I have read some distrubing reviews I hope it's mostly just hype. I hope book four is just as good as book 1-3. Don't worry if it's not I will let you know...trust.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|You won't like this film much if you: 1) Don't \\"get\\" South Park-style libertarian humor 2) LOVE Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer action movies 3) Are not \\"up\\" on current events, both domestic and international (I was asked by someone why it was funny that Hans Blix would send an \\"angry letter\\" to a WMD-seeking dictatorship) 4) Think \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" was 'fair & balanced documentary' 5) Were moved to tears when they saw \\"Rent\\" 6) Have a hang-up about sex/profanity in the movies 7) Always HATED \\"Thunderbirds\\", \\"Fireball XL-5\\" and other 1960s puppetoons 8) Admire overpaid, spoiled Hollywood actors who \\"speak out\\" on political issues 9) Live in 'Durka-Durka-Stan'. Unsurprisingly, this is the best American film yet that addresses War on Terror issues. Most of the others I've seen have seemed a bit more...ahem...'wooden'.
0553579908|5.0|A Clash of Kings continues from the first book a Games of Thrones. Wow, let me just say that if over the summer you are looking to read a really good series or a few great books. Here you go. Let me start off by saying yo, I am loving my girl ARYA, her sister Sansa needs to be thrown off a cliff. I keep hopeing that Arya will get with Jon Snow (another fav) or the bastard son of the king. Oh and don't sleep on Tyrion, little dude is one of the best reasons to keep reading the book. His humor and his intellegence is wonderful.
B000002U9K|5.0|I don't know whether they have evolved a \\"more mature sound\\" during their 90 albums but PSB will always be the champion of pop music for me just for the sake of their brilliant first three albums, beautifully rounded by Discography: Please, Actually and Introspective are the results of a massive will to burst out for Neil & Chris, not in commercial sense, but in feelings and psychological terms. Being not-so-ggod looking, silent and always introspective personalities, the duo expressed what they felt about the outside world in their first three albums, and the consequences are mindboggling. <br /> <br />Please is the first suberp product of this chemistry bonded between two members. Starting from the brilliant \\"Two Divided by Zero\\", Neil, both vocally and lyrically, displays a somehow frightened and desperate personality while the music reflects so much confidentiality that the opposite reaction is wonderful.  <br /> <br />\\"Two divided by zero\\" which would not be inappropriate in a James Bond soundtrack is followed by the ever-green and seminal West End girls, followed by clashing but epic Opportunities followed by a fan-love Love Comes Quickly and the ever-critical Suburbia (\\"where is the policeman when you need one?\\"). In good ol' casette days, this is where the Side A stops and you just raise your head in astonismment about the smooth flow of songs. Then you continue your dreamscaping journey: A reprise of Opportunities gives way to the brilliant Tonight is Forever (\\"I have no job but I can stay in bed all day), a simple version of Violence (a much improved version appeared as a later b-side but the skeleton remains the same), the flippy but burning I Want a Lover (\\"Just put your arms around me but it doesn't mean you love me\\"), the self-expressing slow piece Later Tonight (never the piano sounded so good in a poptrack before) and closure by Duran Duran-like Why Don't We Live Together? <br /> <br />Did you read the whole paragraph without a stop? Yes, this is howthe album flows: Breathless, fantastic, topnotch music (and don't forget this is the \\"unexperienced\\" product of Boys) with some of the best lyrics in the entire cannon of pop music that Britney Spears or Kylie could not even dream of in their wildest dreams. <br /> <br />It's a pity that PSB remain a cult band in the United States but there is always a buyer group of good music and this is also true for them. They are now iconic figures around the globe and one of the best and most respected groups as pop music goes. They are up there with the Beatles and much above their peers when you look at the whole sum. <br /> <br />Please is a lucky piece of great music and the starting point of a amazing career for them and a dazzling journey for music lovers. <br /> <br />If you love pop music, buy this you won't regret. <br />If you don't like pop music, then try this...you may be surprised and awarded more than you think...
0790743132|5.0|Hands down, Casablanca is the best film I have ever seen. I have studied films from almost every genre, culture, and time period, and none of them have been as complete a package as this classic. Its influence on our culture cannot be denied; just look at the number of lines that anyone can recognize from the film, even if they've never seen it before (including the classic, \\"Play it again, Sam,\\" which no one actually says in the movie). It almost single-handedly formed the genre of the Hollywood romance as we know it today. But it's not a great movie because it's influential; it's influential because it's a great movie. <br /> <br />At the heart of Casablanca is an amazing set of actors. Humphrey Bogart is the man everyone will recognize for his bitingly cynical hero Rick Blaine, and he plays it to perfection. The other actors in the film are just as powerful, playing their roles to perfection. Sam is a loyal friend and confidant of Rick's who tries to protect the stubborn barkeep. Ilsa is a confused and love-torn woman who honestly seems to love both her old lover Rick and her husband Victor Laslow. Claud Raines, arguably the best actor of the bunch, pitches in an excellent role as Louis, the smarmy captain of the police in Casablanca. <br /> <br />Beyond the terrific performances in the film, the story itself is unique and tense. The setting of Casablanca adds a desperation to everyone's performance, and the love triangle between Ilsa, Rick, and Victor is ever-present, accentuated by the masterfully performed music, often a variation of the love song \\"As Time Goes By.\\" The directing is top notch as the cameras focus on the desperation and tension in each actor's performance while at the same time breaking that tension with comedy at just the right moments. And of course, the ending is perfectly bittersweet, with Rick having to make the hardest decision and biggest sacrifice of his life. <br /> <br />There have been many great films both before and after Casablanca. However, I have never seen another movie where I can't point out even one criticism or glaring flaw. Casablanca is truly unique, and in my mind is by far the best film of all time.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|I am a big fan of the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory released in 1971. I really looked forward to the updated version, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, starring Johnny Depp and recently released on DVD.  <br /> <br />Johnny Depp's performance is embarassing. His pale, fey portayal of the quirky candymaker who says, \\" 'kay?\\" in every scene is disappointing and annoying. Wonka needs to be quirky but please retain some likeability, Johnny. This version of the movie is more faithful to the Ronald Dahl novel but a strange backstory is shoehorned in to illustrate Wonka's conflicted relationship with his strict dentist father. The Oompah Loompahs are creepy instead if cute in this verision and perform some repetitive dance numbers to some new music. If there is one redeeming feature it is that the visuals are stunning and images of the factory rooms will stay with you long after the movie is over.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this is yet another Tim burton film with beautiful cinematography but lacking in screenplay substance. The syrupy sweet ending bashing us over the head about the importance of family gave me a toothache. I'll stick with the original, \\" 'kay?\\"
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, poor dad is a great book. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a book that will discuss how to how to think about money and making money.<br /><br />The book's author writes weekly articles on finance.yahoo.com. Read at least one of  his columns before buying the book. You will get a good feel of what the book is all about, and what to expect out of it.<br /><br />The book is excellent, but it can be very frustrating for someone looking for a \\"recipe\\" or clear strategy on how to make money.<br /><br />The book talks about accumulating assets, and he defines assets as things which will create a positive monthly cashflow. According to the author's definition, your own home is not an asset. He sees it as a liability, since most people have to pay monthly expenses such as mortgage, utilities, and maintenance.<br /><br />He hammers on the point that your expenses should be below your income, and stresses that you do not need money to make money (You can borrow your from bankers, friends and family, even credit cards in order to buy cashflow producing assets).<br /><br />This book will NOT teach you how to invest on any market (real estate, stocks or bonds).<br /><br />The author stresses that you should look for other books, tapes, seminars about strategies for making money (such as buying real estate properties).<br /><br />Bottom line: Buy the book if you want to change the way you see money. Do NOT buy the book if you are looking for specific investment advices and money making strategies.<br /><br />Specially if you are looking at investing in Real estate I would suggest looking at other books.<br /><br />Mari  @  Georgia-Agent.com
6305433909|1.0|This is dreadful. Sister Act was wonderful: original, funny, and heart-warming. Sister Act 2 is appalling in every way- the teenage characters are stereotypes, most of the jokes are bad cliches, and the storyline is like a fluffy, crappo version of Dangerous Minds. Worst of all, we don't get to see much of the characters we know and love from the first film- they are shunted to the background, and Whoopi Goldberg is expected to carry the whole feature- along with her idiotic, wooden, and unrealistic class of students of course. I also find Whoopi Goldberg's character's new preachiness unconvincing and hollow. In a nutshell? Thumbs down.
1577314808|5.0|The comment \\"The title says it all\\" says \\"I dont even think there was a technique telling you how to achieve...\\"Of course, there is no technique, nothing one can learn about spiritual realization. The comment \\"For whom the bell tolles\\" speaks of \\"a profound act of Grace wich led him (Eckart Tolle) to the spiritual life\\". An act of Grace has nothing to do with a technique. And a third comment \\" I have lived this book\\" touches the essencial point: LOVE. Love equals Forgive. How can I love? Here is the missing point about all that question of Being NOW. And this missing point is FAITH.If only I could possibly believe that ONLY GOOD IS, that Evil is only a mental creation, that God and Good are the same thing,and so Good is omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient, if I could BELIEVE that, love will be spontaneous, and all mental caos shall finish. I will be NOW. \\"Nobody can convince me of evil\\" is a Jesus Christ statement. The power of Now is a result of believing in the absolutness of Good. And I think this is Tolle great mistake: it seems Tolle believes spiritual techniques are able to achieve NOW. NOW is the ever present Good and to be Now one needs to believe that ONLY GOOD IS. That is what Jesus taught and proved.
0440217563|5.0|I started backwards in reading this series of novels.  I read The Fiery Cross first which depicts a middle-aged couple who really understand, respect each other, and love each other deeply.  With the completion of this book, I have now read the first three.   <br /> <br />One of things I am enjoying in this book is seeing the relationship between Jamie & Claire grow.  They are learning to understand each other.  He now accpets that she was \\"born to be a healer\\"  and must go and help the injured and sick. By the end of this volume, he no longer fights her on it.  She also must learn to accept that he had a life without her for 20 years and fathered another child.  She learns to trust his word which she didn't earlier in the book when she discovers he had been married to someone else. <br /> <br />I also enjoy the discussion of courage. Heros do exist in the world.  Recently, we lost a family member who many times risked his life under fire to save others.  Some of us do go through not just disappointments and hardships, but difficult losses.  The book reflects what is often true, its family and loyal friends that really count.  The kind of loyalty that soldiers understand.  <br /> <br />Yes, it is adventure, sometimes a little contrived. Sometimes, I wanted them to slow down a little just so I could stop reading and take a break!!  But it is fun, and reflects some basic truths about life.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Like OK Computer, manages to be both new and completely timeless <br />and challenging. Plus the best response to 9/11 i've heard, and probably will ever hear, in \\"Jesus, etc.\\".
B00004IC9G|4.0|Isn't as sophisticated as the later albums...but you can feel the power and the attitude since the beginning. The power of Eric's voice is as thunder killing as the very best of the Manowar albums.  It is very Heavy Metal. If you are a true heavy metal fan...this is a great way to start Manowar. Not for beginners...not for commercial music, only true dealers of the power metal in your head. <br /> <br />
B00004XQP4|5.0|<br />    I have been a fan of Greenday scince the begging, and are extremely happy about their sucess this year with the unbelivable epic \\"Americian Idiot\\" . However, dispite how awesome AI is,  it is my opinion that \\"Warning\\" is their most mature, and musically interesting album. This album is also there biggest departure from their punk rock roots. Every song is more musically complicated than just the power chord punk songs that they became famous for, but began to sound repetative. Lyricaly , I belive that this is there best album as well, Billy Joe finally loosing that \\"teen angst\\" whine and really pumping out some amazing words. The song Misery is clearly forshadowing the type of story telling which inspired the opera American Idiot, and Minority is also showing their more political side that again came to even more fuirtion in AI. Two of Greenday's most emotional songs come from the amazing \\"Waiting \\" and \\"Macy's Day Parade\\", truley chilling and thought provoking. Listening to this album, you really start to understand Greenday, and relaize there is much more depth and power to there music than can be seen on the surface. Better than American Idiot, This album is greenday's best album.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|After I first saw \\"Sin City\\" I was astonished at how amazing it was. This is not a movie based upon the Frank Miller comic; this is Frank Miller's comic itself. The film breaths, speaks and looks just like the comic's very people and locations; whole scenes are exactly as they appear in Miller's book. Simply astounding! Furthermore, the special effects (most of the movie was filmed against a green screen) are seamless and create a look in the film that is absolutely beautiful. I also love the fact that Robert Rodriquez insisted that Frank Miller work as a co-director in the movie (along with Quentin Tarantino) much to the chagrin of the director's guild. The result is that the film retains all the richness of Miller's vision and style (unlike movies that promise a faithfulness to a particular author but in reality never deliver the proverbial goods-\\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" by Francis Coppola comes to mind-what a piece of crap!). <br /> <br />My only caution is that if this is a movie you want to purchase for your child; don't. This is not a film for children-\\"Sin City\\" is definitely for mature audiences only. At any rate, along with \\"Batman Begins\\" \\"Sin City\\" is the best comic book movie I've ever seen. This is not an overstatement or exaggeration. You will not be disappointed.  <br /> <br />Caesar gives two enthusiastic thumbs up! <br />
B000002AOD|5.0|This CD demonstrates Michel Camilo's skills as a composer and arranger, in addition to his mastery of the piano.  His virtuosity is dazzling as always.  A Latin flavor pervades the album, but you can hear the blues and funk influences as well. The tunes are mostly upbeat and highly syncopated.  It's great fun to listen - one of my all-time favorites.  \\"Just Kidding\\" and \\"Caribe\\" are worth the price of admission alone.  Great driving music - but keep your eyes on the speedometer!
B000002JSP|3.0|I do agree that this album was not at the top of Zeppelins podium, they have pratically pissed all over there work.  But zeppelin is zeppelin. It is the stepping stones to the music of today and tomorow.I love them and i always will
B0007PAMBK|5.0|I love this film.  It is dark, creepy, and the characters are so believable especially the side characters, like the Head of the Organ making company and the doctor.  These people didn't look like actors, they looked like average, ordinary people.  I truly cannot say enough good things about this film, except that I consider it a masterpiece.  I own this film about 3 times over on various DVD packs.  This particular one I have rented but I don't own.  Dispite what traditionalist may say, I like the optional color, just to see what it looks like, but the black and white is far more beautiful.  This is not only a erie, creepy film, it is beautiful.  Also the star of the film, supposedly dissappeard after this film was made and never made another movie.  I don't know if this is true, but the myth just adds to the mystique of this film.  THIS FILM IS A MUST HAVE IN YOUR HORROR MOVIE COLLECITON, any version you can get.  I sure would love to watch this film with commentary <br />I would put this movie up with any modern day horror film or any film period.  This film should be studied in film school along with the short films of Maya Deren.
B000683VI4|5.0|Sometimes sappy, but a wonderful story all the same. Each actor gives a fine performance. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it with someone you love.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|Both my seven year old daughter and I (her 40 year old mother) loved this movie.  I would have loved it regardless whether my daughter did, and frankly, I rented it for me. <br /> <br />I am a huge Buffy fan. Also have always read comic books and enjoyed the Xmen movies immensely.  An Sf fan through and true. <br /> <br />This movie had the right balance of angst and lightheartedness to appeal to a very wide age range, and yet - it is desperately missing one thing  :  A sequel. <br /> <br />The actors in this movie did a fine job, and I hope to see them in the *Sequel*.  The comic book stills at the end makes me wonder if Disney won't put out comic books about these characters. <br /> <br />Come on disney - you market everything else to death, why not this? <br /> <br />All in all an enjoyable ride. <br /> <br />
B000BTJCRM|4.0|This is brilliant - shades of Sabbath and Zeppelin, Cream maybe, Doors keyboads, Uriah Heep organ, almost thought I heard Status Quo for a second or two, even a bit of T-Rex and so much more that you can't quite put your finger on. You get the feeling that you've heard it all before, but soon realise this is BRAND NEW hard driving rock ... 3 piece power at its very best, chugging rhythms, thumping chords and vocals that are both bizarre and addictive. It's bands like this (that are unfortunately all too few) that give me hope that rock continues to evolve and rule and  hopefully that rap-crap hiphop hype will soon stop polluting the airwaves.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I'm a newcomer to Coldplay and don't presume to add much to the praise that has come before me.  But this album, after just one listen, felt like I was hearing songs I'd loved all my life: a very unusual sensation.  This isn't the best music I've ever heard, but it's probably the most comfortable.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Richard Curtis (\\"4 Weddings and a Funeral,\\" \\"Bridget Jones' Diary,\\" \\"Notting Hill\\") may be the reigning champ of the British romantic comedy.  In \\"Love Actually,\\" he lets his writing and directing talents run wild as he gives us seemingly dozens of interlapping tales of romance -- mainly comic, some farcical, others poignant -- all based in London in the five weeks before Christmas. <br /> <br />Where does one start with a movie that stars (and gives quality time to) such luminaries as Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman, and has inspired cameos by Billy Bob Thornton as the U.S. President, and numerous American beauties such as Shannen Elizabeth and Denise Ricahrds?  I'd probably start with the guy who nearly steals the show, Bill Nighy.  In the movie's most original subplot, Nighy plays Billy Mack, an aging pop star reduced to rewriting one of his hits (\\"Love is All Around,\\" from the \\"4 Weddings\\" soundtrack, naturally) in a shameless bit of exploitation as \\"Christmas is All Around.\\"  Mack knows he's doing this just for a buck, and he tells everyone (including the listening public, to the horror of his long-suffering manager) what horrible dreck the song is.  But it's his chance to become popular again, and that's what a pop star needs.  Nighy personifies the aging rocker to the hilt in a movie-defining performance. <br /> <br />The Billy Mack sub-plot kind of stands to one side in this movie, as its only connection to the rest of the stories comes through the other characters listening to Mack's \\"hit\\" on the radio or watching the video, a horribly sexist monstrosity directly descended from Robert Plant's \\"Addicted to Love\\" video. <br /> <br />The rest of the cast is more or less inter-related, whether by employment, marriage, or birth.  Take your pick for charming subplots.  Colin Firth discovers his wife's affair with his own brother, and he falls for his Portuguese housekeeper -- leading to a romance that overcomes a hilarious language barrier.  Liam Neeson's wife has just died, and his adorable 11-year old stepson is tormented both by the loss of his mother and the fact that he is in love with the most popular girl in school.  The solution - become a talented musician, and the girls will fall for you (just like Billy Mack!).  Or there's Hugh Grant as the bachelor Prime Minister, who becomes a national hero after publicly chastising the U.S. President (Thornton, so very creepy) for lording its superpower status over its friends.  Sure, he's a national hero, but he's also got a crush on his catering manager, and he's not sure if he can ask her for a date. <br /> <br />And so on, and so forth.  One could go on describing sub-plots (and there are many other worthy stories here), but it would take longer than it does to watch the movie. <br /> <br />Curtis' greatest achievement is the magnificent interweaving of these various tales.  Each has a slightly different emotional heft to it -- there's the melancholy tale of Alan Rickman's tepid experimentation with an affair at the expense of his wife, Emma Thompson, but there's also the absurdist adventure of Connor, self-proclaimed \\"sex god on the wrong continent,\\" who goes to America to meet girls, and in Milwaukie, Wisconsin, he hits the mother lode.  But the stories flow together naturally, and that's no small trick. <br /> <br />This is an ultimately silly-yet-heartfelt movie that contains a several laughs and outright guffaws, and you will also probably find yourself tearing up during a few scenes, as well.  But be warned -- this is definitely an R-rated movie, both on the language front as well as with the \\"skin.\\"  Some movies are rated 'R', and you're not really sure why - but this one's clear.  I'm not criticizing, but you may want to think twice before watching this movie with prudish friends and family. <br /> <br />Check it out.
6305609705|5.0|I knew I was going to like this film when first lines were said by the narrator i.e. Martin Sheen: \\"Saigon... Sh*t...\\". That was so expressive, it totally illustrated the situation and got you in a right mood. I understand why many don't get the idea of the movie and consider it boring - first, Coppola's presentation of this idea came out to be rather vague, and you have to concentrate really hard to get it. And second - yes, two and a half hours may seem intolerable and boring, but that's the price you have to pay for understanding the message. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is very meditative and monotonous. You just need to feel its rhythm and then you begin to trance. And your trance is supported throughout the whole movie by excellent music, beautiful long frames and a caravan of endless, seemingly pointless and seemingly dull scenes. And the longer the movie the more effect it has on you. Coppola managed to show us the real life, the usual monotony of a soldier's days in Viet-Nam, and that everyday routine turned out to be horrible. No surprise that colonel Kurtz lost his mind. We see Sheen's character also being close to losing his, and I personally got the feeling by the end of the picture something was happening to me. Coppola's creative energy poured out on me right from the screen.<br /><br />Marlon Brando's words in the end of the film were not pointless nonsence of a crazy man, as many people tend to think. Actually the man was not mad, he just walked away from reality to keep sanity. And his words about how only killing mercilessly can help you to win a war explain a lot about war's nature and about alterations of a man at war. War is \\"...a horror... a horror...\\" as we hear Kurtz saying, and those are the words of a colonel who's seen a lot. And we see this horror also, although not literally; we don't see piles of severed limbs or heads or any gore. We are there with Martin Sheen's character first at Saigon hotel, then flying in a helicopter to the battle zone, watching napalm strike, going by boat all the way to the Kurtz's compound... We are there, we are tranced, we are losing our mind and we are horrified. Well, that is if we try to watch the movie right. That's why I think Coppola fully demonstrated his immense talent in this picture making it (the picture) one of the best war and anti-war films ever. Well, not to be modest, I'd say just one of the best films ever. It's definately hard to watch, but if you try really well, you'll be rewarded with an unforgettable (but not always pleasant) journey to the places you've probably never been to.<br /><br />Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando are superb, just awesome, besides here you can meet outstanding Robert Duvall, Harrison Ford, hard-to-recognize Laurence Fishburne and Dennis Hopper, who is maybe the only or one of the very few actors lucky to appear in so many really cult and milestone pictures of our time. And I mean \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\", \\"Easy Rider\\", \\"Apocalypse Now\\", \\"Rumble Fish\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\".<br /><br />And the last thing I'd like to say - it just thrills me when I read about how many obstacles and difficulties the makers of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" had while filming. Sometimes it seemed to me this movie was never meant to be, the nature itself was against it. That's why I think of Francis Ford Coppola as of one of the true contemporary geniuses. It's his huge merit \\"Apocalypse Now\\" finally saw the light of day. Cinema history would be incomplete without this movie.g napalm strike, going by boat all the way to the Kurtz's compound...

B000BKVQTS|1.0|I watched this movie on New Years Eve and thought it was just terrible. It was a boring, stupid, colorless movie. It could have been a good movie given the actors it had but was so disappointing.  <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I doubt thats the real release date. It is probably a mistake or misprint. Square Enix is not that retarded. This is a release date set by another website, [...]    <br />go here and look at the release date, I'd say thats a LOT more acurate.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is sad. Of course, because he wants to see Jesus getting beat. But it's something everyone must see once, and something to show to new believers to show what exactly happend to Jesus, but once you've watched it, you won't wanna watch it again, because it makes you upset. A great movie though, everything is VERY realistic
B000001GQY|5.0|Brahms's monumental piano concertos are my very favorite piano concertos.  Therefore, I own many recordings of same.  Nevertheless, this recording with Gilels and Jochum is my absolute favorite!  It is a recording that I've listened to, at least, once a week for many years. Gilels and Jochum truly play these \\"monsters of the form\\" wonderfully capturing Brahms's fierceness as well as his tenderness beautifully.<br /><br />Truth be known, I slightly prefer the 1st concerto-I know that is a musical sacrilege. My god, Gilels plays the hell out of that work delivering those (what I call) \\"trills of death\\" in the first movement in such a manner that it still sends chills up and down my spine no matter how many time I have listened to the work.<br /><br />DGG has done a superb job in it transfer to this \\"new\\" CD form.  I owned the original vinyl recordings; however, I feel these CDs give the recording more depth with the sound being far richer.<br /><br />If you want to hear a legendary and sublime recording of the Brahms's Piano Concertos,buy these discs.
B00011RPB0|5.0|I'd just like to point something out to everyone calling the characters ungrateful for their travel opportunity, or idiotic for being unable to find something for themselves in the short time they spend in Tokyo. While the Japanese culture DOES play a heavy role in this film, the whole \\"strange foreign culture\\" bit is a metaphor for cultural alienation. Apparently this (rather heavy-handed, mind you) conceit is too difficult for some people to  notice.
B000002G7E|5.0|Having been a precocious kid I had the distinct pleasure (yes, I said pleasure) of seeing this band at the original Tea Party in the South End of Boston shortly after the release of \\"White Light/White Heat\\".  Moe Tucker was still playing her drums standing like a mad majorette.  Cale's electric voila was so loud plaster dust fell from the ceiling, literally. <br /> <br />With all the peace and love nonsense cluttering what little media was free enough to experiment this album cut like a knife through to the truth of what city life was really about. <br /> <br />When my sons asked me if I was a hippie I gave them the first MC5 and Stooges' albums - and \\"White Light/White Heat\\".  They now play in a Punk band.  I'm glad they got the point... <br /> <br />
B000002KNU|5.0|\\"Talking Heads: 77\\" is an incredibly original album; it essentially made post-punk a credible \\"sub\\"genre. It doesn't sound too dated (it did come out in 1977 after all) and although it could probably use a remastering, you won't mind too much. I'll admit that basically the only Talking Heads song I knew before I heard this album was \\"Once In A Lifetime\\" (off \\"Remain In Light\\"), and although that's a pretty good album and a great song, \\"Talking Heads: 77\\" is WAY better (and I'll also admit that at first I didn't really like this album - it definitely grows on you over time). It is definitely straight up post-punk (think of Gang Of Four's \\"Entertainment!\\") that features completely nonsensical (but interesting and sometimes funny) lyrics as well as David Byrne's quirky-yet-lovable singing style. This album DID have two hits - \\"Uh-Oh, Love Comes To Town\\" and \\"Psycho Killer\\" - and although they DO help make the album more appealing to non-genre fans I still don't think the majority of people will like it. Despite this it's also arguably their most accessible album. Not all of the songs are as instantly catchy and appealing as these two, but the rest are still very very good. With all this in mind I would've given it 5 stars, but it's historical influence makes it that much more worth it. Post-punk fans and open-minded listeners will definitely love it, though. A classic album that's highly recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000BKVQTS|4.0|The past few years have been tough for Terry Gilliam. Amidst several false starts, including, most famously, the aborted attempt to make The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (as documented in Lost in La Mancha), the veteran filmmaker was desperate to make a movie and took a director-for-hire gig with Miramax (akin, in some circles, to making a pact with the Devil). During the course of making The Brothers Grimm, Gilliam clashed with studio honcho Harvey Weinstein over several issues: the director's regular cinematographer was fired by the studio and during the editing process an incensed Gilliam, tired of it all, left the production and went off to make another movie (Tideland). After some time had passed and the dust settled, he returned and was allowed to supervise his cut of the movie which was released in theatres and now on DVD.<br /><br />After seven years since his last movie, Gilliam fans were just happy to see another movie by the director. The Brothers Grimm is a return to the grungy, medieval worlds depicted in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Jaberwocky.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm also continues Gilliam's fascination with protagonists who are fantasts who make things up in order to escape from reality or, in the case of Jake and Will, responsibility. Those familiar with Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow will notice the similarities in plot: a village is terrorized by supernatural evil and it is up to a foppish protagonist to succeed where others have failed and prove themselves. The Brothers Grimm certainly is not a bad film, just not one of Gilliam's best, but it is still nice to see him in action. After all, Gilliam at half-strength is better than no Gilliam at all.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Terry Gilliam who is his customarily candid self in this uncharacteristically muted track from the usually animated filmmaker. He admits that when initially given Ehren Kruger's script he didn't like it but needed work and decided to do it anyway. Even though Gilliam doesn't name names, he points out what parts or the film he met with resistance from the studio.<br /><br />There are 12 deleted scenes with optional commentary from Gilliam. It is footage that he admires but that made the movie too long. Surprisingly, the most expensive scene in the movie, involving a giant tree attacking our heroes, was cut because they felt it was too spectacular and made everything that came afterward anti-climatic.<br /><br />\\"Bringing the Fairy Tale to Life\\" is a standard making of featurette with a much more upbeat Gilliam than the one on the commentary track. Of course, none of the conflicts with the studio are discussed.<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Visual Magic of The Brothers Grimm\\" takes a look at the CGI effects used to enhance the movie. Gilliam wanted to use models but some of things, like animated trees had to be rendered digitally.ven though Gilliam doesn't name names, he points out what parts or the film he met with resistance from the studio. <br /> <br />There are 12 deleted scenes with optional commentary from Gilliam.

B0009MAP9A|5.0|\\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" is a masterpiece - there's no doubt about it. The difference between an album like this and, say, \\"Blonde On Blonde\\" is that it's not as easily catchy. Dylan still has a lovable-yet-not-as-lovable-as-on-\\"Blonde-On-Blonde\\" voice, and the musicianship is pretty good. The key to these songs, though, is the lyrics - the lyrics ALONE make the album a classic (which is near impossible to do). Only another master lyricist like, say, Jackson Browne could possibly give Dylan a run for his money. Except for possibly the first two songs, none of the album is instantly catchy - they take a while to get used to. I don't think most people will like the album on a first listen - I didn't either - but give it several listens and you'll start to fall in love with it. It ABSOLUTELY rewards repeated listens. As they say, after all, great works of art always take a while to sink in! Highly recommended!!! <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the entire album!
B000AGTPUA|4.0|Based on the book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg, it's something of a mystery why The Polar Express did not connect with audiences when it was released in theatres last year. Perhaps people weren't ready to accept that kind of animation yet - at least not until it looks a bit more realistic. Regardless, Robert Zemeckis' film certainly has all the right ingredients for a classic children's Christmas movie: a timeless message, dazzling visuals, exciting action sequences and universal characters that anyone can relate to.<br /><br />The film contains some of the most impressive computer animation this side of Pixar except that it is not done in a caricature style but rendered as realistically as possible, much like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. However, despite the state-of-the-art CGI, the facial expressions of the characters aren't quite as fully or realistically animated as in hand-drawn animation. They aren't able to accurately render wrinkles on a person's face. They still look too smooth and waxy with the hair looking rather plastic-like. However, the rendering of shadows and light, like a shot of the train stopped by the side of the road, the warm light of its interiors casting shadows on the snow covered ground while flakes of snow fall gently from the sky, looks very impressive indeed. Each scene is elaborately rendered with so much detail that you could pause any frame and spend a good amount of time marveling at all the work that went into this movie.<br /><br />The first disc features a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with \\"You Look Familiar,\\" a featurette on the many faces of Tom Hanks.

B000089CJI|5.0|First things first - if you like Ben Gibbard or Death Cab For Cutie then you're going to love \\"Give Up\\". With \\"Give Up\\" Ben Gibbard proves not only that his voice can be used effectively in several genres (it's still very soothing), but that he can still write great lyrics. The entire album is fun to listen to - the songs aren't necessarily great musically, but they're all incredibly catchy which makes listening to it straight through pleasant and easy. What makes the album a classic, though, is that the lyrics are also deep, memorable and easy to sing along with. Also, songs like \\"Such Great Heights\\" have a high potential of being hits. It's just barely a classic, but a classic nonetheless (especially for its relatively cheap price). Absolutely recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B000002J03|5.0|This second album starts off with the classic \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".  Great, classic up-tempo guitar riff, superb high Elmore James style vocal, and mean, misogynistic lyrics.  After the first verse the drums kick in with about 8 thunderous rim shots, and the blistering, heavy song continues.  The central part is several minutes of psychedelic effects, with guitar screams, heavy breathing etc.  Pretty standard for the day. <br /> <br />Then, from nowhere, a stupendous guitar solo explodes out of the speakers.  Page plays with an overpowering tone and drive, and the short, sweet, and to the point solo takes its place among the classic guitar soloes ever in rock history.  The song continues to its conclusion, leaving you shaking your head in amazement.   <br /> <br />The first time I heard \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" was among several buddies, in a dorm room.  None had ever heard of Led Zeppelin before (except yours truly).  The guys were listening to Three Dog Night, The Beatles, Neil Diamond and the like.  The song stunned them with its power and ferocity, and Page's masterpiece in the middle left them asking questions about who played that, what was the band's name etc.  Several began to realize there was a whole other world of music out there, and were quickly buying Cream, Ten Years After, Hendrix and the rest. <br /> <br />All that said, this is a great album.  Fast songs, slow songs, songs that change tempo, blues numbers, instrumentals.  Its all here. Thing is, the band was still young, still hungry, Plant still had his pipes, Page's fingers were still supple, and Bonham and Jones were a great, thunderous rhythm section.  A great band, rounding into their prime, delivering a blistering classic of hard rock.  A must for any hard rock fan. <br /> <br />
B000088E77|4.0|Most people know Men At Work for their hit single \\"Down Under\\" (and for good reason) and possibly for their other top 100 singles \\"Who Can It Be Now\\" and \\"Be Good Johnny\\" . These 3 songs are great 80's rock tunes that alone make the album worthy of a purchase (they at least help its appeal), but the album does contain several other good tracks too. Unfortunately it's all kind of a guilty pleasure which hurts its possibility of being a classic. It's also pretty uneven so chances are you'll skip several tracks. The lyrics aren't that great, but like their singles they're simple and catchy enough to have fun singing along with. The singer I think is  sort of love-it-or-hate-it for most of the songs. Its three hits move it up from a 4 to a 4.5 (it's also a kind of unique album musically - it's mostly jazz/blues influenced rock but it has a little new wave thrown in). Overall a very good debut that 80's rock fans and those with an open mind will probably like (and its relatively cheap price certainly helps). Recommended!    Highlights include:  \\"Who Can It Be Now?  \\"I Can See It In Your Eyes\\"  \\"Down Under\\"  \\"Underground\\"  \\"Helpless Automaton\\"  \\"People Just Love To Play With Words\\" (kind of)  \\"Be Good Johnny\\"  \\"Down By The Sea\\" (kind of)

B0006B29WA|4.0|Franz Ferdinand is another entry into today's trendy \\"new-wave-influenced-alternative-pop-rock\\". Their first self-titled album is full of fun and catchy songs, but they aren't interesting or thought-provoking enough to truly make it a classic and an essential own (the album doesn't seem to have much soul to it). I can't put my finger on it but there's also something about the songs that make it kind of cheesy (they don't sound...\\"serious\\", and this hurts the rating). A lot of the songs are memorable lyrically simply because they're simple and catchy (it's easy to sing along) - they're definitely not deep, though. The musicianship is occasionally interesting but in a generic kind of way. All things aside, however, there is a high probability that you'll like this album, so for that reason alone I'd recommend buying it. The bonus tracks help, but not by much. Not an essential album but worth getting if you have the extra cash. Recommended. <br /> <br />Highlights include: <br />the whole album!
0887307280|3.0|I teach Entrepreneurial Marketing, so I'm always on the lookout for good books on this topic. I have started many businesses and I can tell you from first-hand knowledge that this is an important book for budding entrepreneurs to read.  <br /> <br />First the good news: Gerber is exactly right. Most new businesses fail because of poor planning, a lack of organization and what I call \\"entrepreneurial disillusionment\\" -- in other words, the owner of the business discovers that running a business doing what he or she loves is not what they thought it would be. It's clear Gerber knows what he's talking about. He hits most (if not all) of the salient drawbacks to starting and running a business. It's an easy weekend read and it is an entertaining book. <br /> <br />Now the bad news: The way Gerber goes about conveying his message might turn people off to the book. He is overly verbose, some of his examples don't make sense and he takes too long to come to the point. In one passage, Gerber wrote for five pages describing \\"opportunity cost,\\" (and never mentions that term) when a sentence or a paragraph would have sufficed. Seasoned businesspeople and grisled entrepreneurs will find this book repetitive, pedestrian and more than a little frustrating as they wait for Gerber to make his point. I think Gerber's editor failed him on this book.  <br /> <br />Having written that, I plan to put this book on the suggested reading list for my Entrepreneurial Marketing classes. I think it might save more than a few new entrepreneurs from making big, hairy, expensive mistakes.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco has made many good albums before \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\", but this one is truly their breakthrough. The majority of songs here are catchy, memorable, and musically/lyrically interesting which is a very hard thing to achieve. Singer Jeff Tweedy is definitely on his game here, and a lot of the pieces seem pretty original. It's mostly a very soothing and mellow album. The lyrics, especially, are pretty good. If you weren't a fan because of Wilco's previous albums I think this'll make you one. As for its sound, it tends to vary - it can be fast at times but it's mostly slow and emotional. A very satisfying album for Wilco fans and I think a great new direction for the band. Most people should love it. Highly recommended!    Highlights include:  \\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart\\"  \\"Kamera\\"  \\"Radio Cure\\"  \\"War On War\\"  \\"Jesus, Etc.\\"  \\"Ashes Of American Flags\\"  \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\"  \\"Pot Kettle Black\\"
0307276902|1.0|Okay, I'll be the dissenter.    Although Frey goes through some harrowing stuff and gives some good info on addiction, the guy is so annoying.  He is such a jerk to everybody that I had a hard time feeling any sympathy for him.  And speaking of annoying, his writing style is just that.  He repeats and repeats and repeats and the capital letters scattered throughout make me wonder if he's really a 13 year old girl posing as an adult.  It would be  a good 200 page book.  Unfortunately it's 400+ pages. Maybe I missed something but I just couldn't get excited about this book.

This workbook made me plow ahead and do what had to be done.

0743454537|4.0|This was a great story that kept my interest - I couldn't put it down. But at the ending, after all the trials of Anna, the author does the unforgivable. She writes an ending which completely abandons all the moral issues presented in the story. Why did she do that? I will admit, I cried and I cried hard at the sad, sad conclusion, but when I had a chance to reflect later about the ending, it seems that the author took the easy way out. This book is worth the read, but I just found the ending to be a little disappointing considering all the heavy issues in the story.
0684857219|5.0|The Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding is the largest tome of bodybuilding information found in any publication, finishing up at around 800 pages with approximately 1000 pictures and weighing in at a whopping 5.8lbs, making it the only book that gives you a workout while reading it. Arnold divides his massive manuscript into a number of sections, starting with the history of bodybuilding, competitions, the gym experience and training techniques (the core exercises) before rounding up with various poses and additional information on bodybuilding supplements and diets. Arnold advocates trying to find pictures of a bodybuilder who fits your size and figure and then aiming to replicate their results. Arnold himself used Reg Park as a model for his first teenage foray in the gym while in subsequent years built each body part up using different bodybuilding models to achieve his own unique juggernaut definition. This is but a tiny fraction of the kind of good quality recommendations that the Encyclopedia comes up with. Bodybuilders (bbs) everywhere refer to the `encyclopedia' for its awesome display of photographs of superhuman bbs throughout the ages. There is no lack of snaps that detail the human anatomy. You will likely run through the book many times to find that muscle group or separation that you missed the first time. It is startling how much anatomy you need to get around before you can understand what impact each exercise has on the developing muscle. This is a fully fledged subject that will have your attention for years to come and there is no better place than to start here. Combining this book with the movie \\"Pumping Iron\\" on DVD will give you a much better idea of where the information is coming from and you will see most of the faces in this book actually exercising and involved in many of the competition photographs that are on display here. Arnold's description of the muscle groups and how to work them is coupled with illustrations and photographs to show the kind of development you should be aiming to achieve. Creating striations on muscle groups like deltoids and pectorals are topics that will cause you to go back to page one to re-examine everything you have read and seen. Anatomical research coupled with exercising methodology and application with dieting will transform your physique over the course of even a few months. As a lifelong hobby you will be bulking up before your first year is out. A few years will have you at competition level. The whole point is get into the gym to work off that fat to reveal your true shape, a shape that can be defined and built upon with muscle. Arnold Schwarzenegger, and other world-class bodybuilders, advocate more than one set per exercise called High-Volume Training, HVT, the traditional method of using multiple sets to train to failure by training each set to failure, resting, and then repeating the set to failure, as many times as it takes before you just can not do anymore sets for that body part. You will build muscle no matter what kind of genetics you have if you stick with HVT. Hypertrophy is the scientific term for the enlargement of muscle tissue caused by a specific amount of intensity needed for the hypertrophy to occur. No intensity, no hypertrophy, no gain. HVT achieves hypertrophy every time because each muscle group is trained to failure. This is the key to building muscle. You must get that straining feeling where you just can't do another repetition. If you find yourself doing lots of repetitions (more than 10) then you need to add more weight. Arnold includes various Power-Training techniques to help shock the body into being able to lift heavier weights. They work.  He also includes increasing intensity techniques by utilizing `forced reps', `negative reps', `isolation training', `supersets' and `stripping methods' among a host of others to learn about. There is much more here then any review can hope to explain (and look at the length of mine!). That iswhy it is 800 pages or so. Apart from the five stars which it deserves the book does have some major drawbacks. The first big drawback is that all the photographs involve drug use. There are only a few photographs of bodybuilders who have not used steroids and the reason is obvious. It is the little dirty secret that hides behind all the bigger muscle on display. You simply will not get as big as these legends without doing drugs. However you will certainly be able to achieve the same definition and still have very big muscles without drugs. The bodybuilders who did not do drugs are at the start of the book in the history of bodybuilding. Look at the photographs of everybody until you reach Reg Park. After that it is all drug users. Achieving the same sizes without drugs is near impossible apart from the exceptionally genetically gifted person. There is also a lesson to learn from this drug experimentation. Don't do it if you put any value on the most important muscle of all... your heart. All of the guys in this book are much older now and you can see them in the bonus material of the \\"Pumping Iron\\" DVD. Sadly they don't look good (sadly some are in wheelchairs) and even Arnold has had a bypass. Just go with food type supplements like 100% Whey Protein and Creatine and stay away from all forms of steroids. The other major drawback is that the 70s bodybuilding era did not give much regard to what is called perfect form. Perfect form is all about doing the exercises the right way to avoid injury. A lot... and I mean a lot... of the exercises in the Encyclopedia are considered very dangerous, mainly because of back arching. These include nearly all of the `Rows'-type exercises (Bent-Over Barbell Rows, Bent-Over Dumbbell Rows, T-bar Rows and the One-Arm Dumbbell Row) which are abandoned today. A `Straight-Leg Deadlift' is something you must do right or you can injure yourself. The `Goodmorning' is considered iffy. Using a Smith-machine for the `Vertical Machine Press' is bad because it has a set path. Triceps `Extensions' are a problem. Take care with `Dipping' and avoid `Sissy Squats'. Arnold's book does not do perfect form so well and in most cases just comes up with plainly dangerous material. This is not to say that you can not do the exercises now and again. Most you can, but in the long term you will only get an injury. Avoiding injury = gain. It is as simple as that. So learn perfect form. How to do this? If you want to learn perfecting form then read \\"The Insider's Tell-All Handbook on Weight-Training Technique\\" by Stuart McRobert. This book clearly explains how to perform Back Extension, Cable Row, Calf Raise, Close-Grip Bench Press, Crunch Abdominal Work, Curl, Decline Bench Press, Dumbbell Row, Finger Extension, Grip Machine Training, Incline Bench Press, Leg Press, Lever Bar Work, L-fly, Neck Work, Overhead Lockout, Overhead Press, Parallel Bar Dip, Partial Deadlift, Pinch-grip Lifting, Prone Row, Pulldown, Pullover, Pullup/Chin, Pushdown, Rader Chest Pull, Shrug, Side Bend, Squat, Stiff-legged Deadlift, Thick-bar Hold and the Wrist Roller Training. Get it along with this book and you will not be disappointed with what you can learn between the two. Getting that perfect form right is something that you can learn from the latter book and start doing better in a year than the bb who has been in the gym for ten years. It is that important. Slow and controlled exercising does not avoid injury. Injury has nothing to do with the speed or control of the exercise. Injury occurs because of bad form. So get the form right, learn what Arnold teaches you about developing muscle groups and stay away from drugs to live until you are 90 with a darn near perfect body. It can be done!<br /><br />Additional notes on things I have since learned: (1)All the images in this book are genetically gifted steroid users. (2)Overtraining and not recovering enough will prevent gains and probably loose gains. Train less days and rest more. (3)Thebig three exercises gain - Squats, Deadlifts and Bench Presses in that order. All other exercises tone. Do these 3. (4)Seated Cleans & Presses, Barbell curls, Calf raises and Inclining Ab crunches are good, but always do the big three. (5)At least 30 minutes of medium intensity cardio every day.is bad because it has a set path. Triceps `Extensions' are a problem. Take care with `Dipping' and avoid `Sissy Squats'.

0895260131|5.0|I purchased this book to get a good insight regarding Islam and the Crusade. The author does not just educate you, but challenges you to go out and investigate yourself! The reviewers who gave one star did not even look into the book as they would have saw what 180 other reviewers saw, The truth regarding the arabic Quran and the Crusade.
0684824906|5.0|What a revelation!  How flawed these men who advised Lincoln were!  And what profound differences from their modern counterparts.  Somebody once said that there are two main reasons to study history: one is to become a voyeur, the other is to become a soothsayer.  Imagine what it would be to actually have intelligent, independent, and passionate people advising the President.  Imagine what it would be to have a President who could weigh the subtleties of balancing life and death, appreciating the value of a loyal opposition, and reaching independent conclusions.  Read this book and try to imagine today's circumstances in that light.  I wonder how the present War Cabinet will look to historians a hundred and fifty years from now.
B000005HLV|5.0|This is not modern black metal. Forget the shocking history of Mayhem, focus on the music. This is regarded as a classic (Top 5) amongst people who really know what black metal is. \\"True\\" black metal bands are not known to have Britney Spears production \\"quality\\". The sound on this CD is a big part of the experience I get when listening to this album. It has a certain atmosphere, an atmosphere you can't create in todays recording studios. The vocals on this album are different but they suit the music and the atmosphere very well. <br /> <br />No one has done the same thing better than Mayhem. Atleast not this album. Don't compare it to Emperor's \\"In the Nightside Eclipse\\" or \\"Wrath of the Tyrant\\". Emperor and Mayhem are two very different bands. <br /> <br />What exactly IS the original early 90's BM sound? Listen to the albums and make a decision.
0064430227|5.0|My husband (age 42) vividly remembers reading this book as a child.  My son loves it even more!  He was able to recite the entire book, just by looking at the illustrations before he turned two!  A must read for every family.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Its great to see a band that gels togheter well and has actual talent, and its easy to see why. Cornell has one of the greatest voices in the genre, Morello is one of the most inovative and talented guitar players of today, Brad Wilk's talent on the drums gels greatly with the rest of the band, and Tim Commerfords driving bass keeps the sound alive. If your a fan of guitar playing this record contains some of the greatest guitar parts ive ever heard recorded. The way Morello uses his effects is like a whole other instrument in itself, an example would be the solo for Your Time Has Come which has like a huge delayed guitar effect along with toggle switching to create a really fast moving high pitched minimalist guitar sound. Each and every song has a unique guitar solo to it, which shows off Morellos great talent, tone, and technique. Some guitar highlights would be the shredding solo in #1 zero, the worms effect driven solo, and drown me slowly's solo which shows basically everything from his technique such as crazy effects, shredding, and dj scratching. So for the guitar enthusiast I highly recomend this album. Overall this is a great album, not as good as the first in my opinion, but very close.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|i recently bought GNR's Greatest Hits and i came across two conclusions. Not only is it great rock, but it's cheap. I spent only ten bucks and it includes hits like welcome to the jungle, sweet child o' mine, don't cry, patience and my all time favorite paradise city. I've been a fan of GNR for a few years now, and i have to admit that it tops my list of favorite bands. I first heard of them through a friend. He was listening to paradise city and i instantly became a fan. i was mesmerized with the great lyrics, axl rose's voice and the overall sound. plus, who can ignore the great guitar playing by slash. he's simply amazing. if you're just being introduced to GNR, like me, then this is a must buy. trust, me it's worth every penny.
0345475674|5.0|I read this book because I liked Robert Harris's other books, especially Enigma and Archangel and I was not disappointed. I read it in 4 nights - did not want to put it town. It is great historical fiction - just enough history plus just enough fiction.
