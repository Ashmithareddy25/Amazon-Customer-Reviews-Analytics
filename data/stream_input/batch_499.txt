B000002NIW|5.0|I first heard this album in the middle of a visual arts class at high school in '97. I had actually repeated my last senior year because i stuffed it the first time round by drinking too much alcohol and going to too many gigs. I wanted to be a rock star, and yadda yadda yadda, anyway that's a different story. Back to high school. So yeh, i had repeated and all the kids in my new classes thought i was some kind of freak because i was really moody and depressed and hated everybody and everything and here i was in the middle of this class listening to the Deftones and i thought it totally rocked.  <br /> <br />I asked one of the other guys who it was and they said, funnily enough, 'It's the Deftones, dude\\". And i said, \\"Dude, these guys are like, totally awesome\\". All of a sudden i had a whole new bunch of friends and we all proceeded to screw up school by drinking too much, going to too many gigs, and wanting to be rock stars. Yeh okay, ive digressed again... <br /> <br />The absolute ultimate experience for me was seeing The Deftones live at the Iron Duke Hotel in Alexandria. This place is just a small little hole of a pub but it was the coolest place on earth. It had fantastic acoustics and the best vibe. I couldn't beleive the Deftones were going to play there though, it was just way too small a venue. But play they did. Chino had such presence on stage.  <br /> <br />I remember joking with some small chick that she shouldnt be up front because when the 'tones come on she was going to get crushed. But she said No way dude your the one who is going to get crushed by all us teeny bopper girls cause Chino is so sexy we are all going to rush the stage. She wasn't too far wrong. hehe. Memories. <br /> <br />RIP Iron Duke Hotel, now it is just a small little pub where old people drink away their pension cheques. <br /> <br />Anyway i guess this hasnt been much of a review, more of a nostalgia trip. This was an awesome album, right there at the birth of the whole nu-metal thing but i think unlike all the other bands like KoRn and Limp Bizkit which will become dated, The Deftones will transcend above the rest and find its niche in genuine music history. It was nu-metal but it was also authentic. Original but grounded in true musical feeling. <br /> <br />Ahh this all sounds like crappy, wanna be intellectual babble. Just listen to the album you will know what i mean.
6301986024|3.0|I didn't see this when if first came out, so perhaps I'm unfairly comparing it to the remake, which I thought was very well done and interesting.    Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway are two of my favorite actors.  They were both terrifically talented people, but I don't think they are at their best in this film.  They are nice to look at, but the script doesn't give them much to work with.  The chess scene is very good, until they start smooching, when the soundtrack and choreography go out of control.    The soundtrack is beautiful on its own, but is too intrusive during the film.    It's a fluffy film with a thin plot, but it's fun to watch, if only to see McQueen and Dunaway in their prime.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Just to get this out of the way, both the person who keeps giving TOT 5 star reviews and the person who keeps giving TOT 1 star reviews... you guys need a damn life. You both are trying to put down the other but both of you are equal losers who are preventing people from reading real reviews. Get a sex life. <br /> <br />Anyways, I have listened to all of Dream Theater's albums and in my opinion Train of Thought is a great album. However, I do feel that this is one of DT's weakest albums. I think the main problem with the songs are that they are too long and have a tendency to stagnate. Don't get me wrong, I love their long epics but most of these songs could have easily been made shorter. With that critique aside, all of the songs have very catchy riffs and melodies and the solos are out of this world. I would not recommend this CD to new fans or to those who say, \\"Why don't they make another Images & Words?\\" But for the DT fans who understand what they are about and like hearing them \\"progress\\" from album to album, you will enjoy this CD as long as you take it as an extremely heavy Dream Theater album. Hence the 4 stars.
0375507256|5.0|A fantastic novel, to say the least.  One of the best books that I have read in quite a while from a contemporary author.  I especially loved the sections \\"Letters From Zedelghem\\" and \\"An Orison of Sonmi-451\\". <br /> <br />This book is a challenge but well worth the work if you love to try reading something new and exciting. <br /> <br />I had a little trouble getting through the first section but after that I was hardly able to put the book down.
0066620996|5.0|There are dozens of long, favorable reviews heaping praise on Jim Collins and team. Suffice it to say, this book offers useful insights and tangible concepts. <br /> <br />Equally important for the small business person, this offers a unique insight into the composition and attributes of successful companies. Collins & Co do an excellent job organizing huge volumes of research, and making the information very plain. <br /> <br />Best, <br />Toby Lucich
B0000025LS|5.0|With ZEBOP!, Carlos Santana and his band entered the 80s in style. Santana is not only a soulful, masterful guitarist, but a wonderful human being who believes, rightly, that the young Australian tourist convicted in Indonesia in 2005 on a trumped-up drug-smuggling charge is innocent. The vocals, mostly by Alex Ligertwood, are superb as well. Anyone who loves Latin-flavored R&B-rock AND cares about others should own this one.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Having seen the concert on NBC in HDTV and Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound, I only hope that the DVD is even close to looking and sounding as good as the broadcast. I haven't seen these guys live since 1980, but they still look and sound terrific. I was apprehensive at first with the addition of the horn section, but they were actually a plus on most of the numbers. Different isn't always bad, and Joe's \\"One Day at a Time\\" was a definite thumbs up.
B000002UA0|5.0|Tune in, turn on, drop out. Thats the driving force beyond Floyd's debut. This is literally Floyd on LSD. There is always talk that their later works were influenced by the affects of LSD, but these rumors were untrue. THIS ALBUM, however, was conceived, written and performed under the influence of (HIGH QUANTITIES) of acid. In fact, original Floyd frontman, and genius, Syd Barrett experimented (???) with the stuff so much that he went crazy. He took a trip into the atmosphere, the cosmos, and never returned. Not even to this day. This is raw, uncut, metallic Floyd. Although I have never tried acid myself, when I listen to this album I can begin to scratch the surface of what an acid trip must be like. This is a great album. Floyd was the first group to experiment with their instruments in this fashion. Barrett would often JUST play reverb at shows, or spend 1/2 an hour running a lighter up and down the strings of his guitar. This album sounds nothing like later Floyd albums, yet it sounds EXACTLY like later Floyd albums. Considering the year this album was recorded, 1967, this music is groundbreaking. NOBODY sounded like Floyd. And Barrett, before he blasted off into space, was a fantastic, genius singer/songwriter. He wasnt the greatest guitar player, but his experimentaion with that instrument made up for what he lacked in actual guitar playing talent. The other 3 members of Floyd, all with the band up until its disintegration in the mid 80's, are already very good musicians by this point but their inprovement between this album and, say, Obscured By Clouds, is ASTRONOMICAL. I would say Floyd is the greatest group of musicians ever assembled.  The songs on here are both simple and complex at the same time. Barretts lyrics are drawn from a variety of sources, including nursery rhymes, fairy tales, everyday life, and poetry. The backround sounds the band added are eerie, trippy, otherworldly. I love to play this album in the dark on my surround sound. And play it loud. Your senses will be overwhelmed by sounds. Sometimes its almost too much to take. But one continues to listen, absorbed in the music, enveloped by sound. Floyds music always seems to speak to you. It calls you. This is an ESSENTIAL ALBUM for any Floyd fan. Its a shame that Barrett only had 2 years of songwriting/music experimenting with Floyd before he went on his permanent \\"trip.\\" One can only imagine what might have been had he remaind grounded. Could Pink Floyd have been BETTER than they turned out to be with the inclusion of David Gilmour??? We'll never know.
B0002YLC24|1.0|Well at least it's shot in Paris! What the heck was this? Almost two hours of rambling, insignificant nonsense, bordering sometimes on hilarity it was so non-believable and unrealistic. What was the point? We are re-introduced to two \\"lovers\\" who knew each other briefly in Vienna, were supposed to rendezvous but didn't [as related in the original movie \\"Before Sunrise\\"], and now have met again 9 years later. They flirt, banter, and make silly comments about politics and art. Although they clearly indicate that, during the interim, they have developed complicated lives, they ignore the issue of how complicated it would likewise be for them to be together. The director apparently felt such a discussion would taint the presumably romantic setting with too heavy a mood.  What's more, we are then left with a questionable ending! To be kind, I'd say at least the lighting and camera shots were good. We do get wonderful glimpses of Paris, but unfortunately not enough to compensate for the poor quality of the script (we're told that the two actors were allowed to improvise many of their conversations-  no kidding!!). This obviously was made for those who just want to bathe themselves in unending, unresolved, never-never of inconsequential nothingness. There's no purpose to this. What a waste of time! Ugh!!
B000024D4R|5.0|I'm completely in AWE of this band. I mean seriously, for Christs sake.....between the years 1967 and 1977 ( a mere 10 years. And thats not really that long if you think about it. Unless you're in prison) Pink Floyd GAVE US......\\"Piper At the Gates of Dawn\\" \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" \\"Ummagumma\\" \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" \\"Meddle\\" \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" \\"DARK SIDE OF THE MOON\\" \\"WISH YOU WERE HERE\\" \\"ANIMALS\\" and finally \\"THE WALL.\\" SH**. What other band, aside from maybe the Beatles, can say they produced THAT MANY MASTERPIECES in 10 damn years!!!??? Or more fairly, can say they produced that many masterpieces in THEIR ENTIRE MUSICAL CAREER!!?? These guys are legends. I would have to give every one of these albums five stars, and thats simply incredible. There will NEVER be a band this good ever again. NEVER. \\"Animals\\" is a WONDERFUL album. It's a toss up for me as to my favorite....its either \\"Animals\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here\\" with the slight advantage going to \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" \\"Animals\\" is Floyd's descriptive masterpiece on society, describing the various types of human being we come across in our everyday lives....Pigs, sheep or dogs. The Floyd derived this topic from George Orwell's socio/political satire \\"Animal Farm.\\" Unfortunately, this album doesnt get as much attention, play or credit as Dark Side, The Wall or Wish You Were Here, but its just as fine as these other albums. The music is soaring and engaging (as always). David Gilmour is one of, if not THE, finest guitar player on this terra cotta that we're all revolving through space on (just because one can play REALLY FAST doesnt necessarily make him the BEST). It's really Gilmour's spectacular guitar playing that makes this album so attractive to listen to. My favorite songs on this album are 'Dogs' and 'Pigs (Three Different Ones)' However as on all Floyd albums, the songs stream nicely into one another which creates for the listener the sense that the album is not broken into different songs but that each songBECOMES the next one. That's one quality of Floyds music that I appreciate so much....their ability to make an entire album flow seamlessly. \\"Dogs\\" however, is probably the best known song off this album, and its beautiful. The production on this album is FLAWLESS. The ten albums I mentioned previously are a must have for any MUSIC fan (not just any Floyd fan). No other group has ever produced such wonderful, soaring music as has The Pink Floyd. They are timeless.

B0007Y4TVU|3.0|the Utah Jazz (NBA basketball team) were absolutely horrible this past year, in my opinion.  with the talent they had, they should've been better, but they disappointed.  and i know Kirilenko was injured, but they still should have performed better.  nonetheless, i stuck with them...and will continue to stick with them -- for better or worse -- in the future (so long as Kirilenko is still there). <br /> <br />what's the point?  System of a Down has put forth a mediocre effort.  it is not as bad as many of the one-star reviewers make it out to be (most of them simply hate SOAD)...but at the same time, it is not as good as many of the five-star reviewers claims (with many of those just believing that SOAD is the best band alive).  this album is just okay.  i am not going to jump off of the wagon just yet, as so many seemed to have done.  i will try to persevere this and hope that things will change. <br /> <br />as for the album itself, it is anchored by a couple of good songs.  \\"Question!\\" and \\"Sad Statue\\" are solid songs.  the former reminds me of \\"Mr. Jack\\" (Steal this Album) or \\"Suggestions\\" (self-titled album) while the latter is perhaps the best song on the album.  the two singles, \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" and \\"Cigaro,\\" are not bad...and \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm on This Song\\" is fast and...strange.  this song reminds me of \\"Bounce\\" (Toxicity) and \\"Ddevil\\" (self-titled album).  \\"Revenga\\" and \\"Radio/Video\\" (which opening reminds me of the band Nuclear Rabbit) are tolerable. <br /> <br />the weakness comes from three songs -- \\"Violent Pornography\\" just seems half-hearted; \\"Old School Hollywood\\" is just a whiney song that does not fit at all (and is not as humorous as some make it out to be).  the most disappointing song to me is \\"Lost in Hollywood.\\"  typically, the closer has been very strong (\\"P.L.U.C.K.\\" on their self-titled; \\"Aerials\\" on Toxicity).  a shot at Hollywood that comes off weak.  also, too much Malakian, which i think is most people's complaint with thealbum as a whole.  \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" is the only song i skip every time i listen to this CD, and since \\"Old School Hollywood\\" is not that great, i typically stop listening to the album after \\"Sad Statue.\\" <br /> <br />sadly, this album suffers from too much of Daron...trying to take over.  my hopes is that the next album will revert back to Serj being the undisputed lead singer, but i do not think it will happen.  compared to other SOAD albums, this is definitely the worst...but it is also not a lost cause either.  but even if you disregard the previous albums and look at this by itself, it is still not solid, at least vocally.  the music is still strong (John's drumming continues to be worthy of praise), but the trademark Serj vocals are not as evident.  i kinda wonder if the invented conversation written by reviewer \\"Thomas Morgan\\" (who gave the album two-stars) really did take place.  anyway, with the talent they have, SOAD should've put forth a better effort <br /> <br />a must for SOAD faithfuls.  fair-weather fans should run away.  first time SOAD buyers should check out their self-titled album or Toxicity before buying this album.
0767805712|4.0|When Gattaca was released in 1997 it slipped under my radar and I didn't see it until two different people recommended it to me recently.<br /><br />Gattaca takes an interesting and almost-plausible science-fiction path and for the most part, pulls it off.  In the \\"not-too-distant-future\\" world of Gattaca some \\"God-children\\" are still conceived the old-fashioned way, but those who can afford it have technology-enhanced test-tube babies with as many imperfections screened out as their parents can afford.  Eye-glasses and heart disease are not present in the \\"valid\\" population.  In Gattaca Ethan Hawke portrays Vincent, who was born the old-fashioned way.  Discrimination is technically illegal in this society, but not enforced, and \\"In-Valids\\" like Vincent can only aspire to menial jobs like janitor.  Vincent dreams of flying into space.  In this world Gattaca is a private corporation, and I don't know what else the company does, but one of the things they do is fly into outer space. Vincent begins at Gattaca sweeping the floors, but he has a plan...<br /><br />Some of the genetically perfect nonetheless come upon hard times.  Jude Law plays Jerome, who was born perfect, but was paralyzed in an accident.  His hair and blood and urine and saliva all remain genetically perfect.  Vincent is brought to Jerome by a shady character who pairs ambitious godchildren with impaired valids.  Carrying Jerome's urine strapped to his leg and his blood in a small cache concealed at his fingertip Vincent applies once again at Gattaca to become an astronaut.  His \\"interview\\" consists only of testing Jerome's perfect urine sample.  With DNA like that Jerome must be perfect...<br /><br />Vincent is getting closer to his goal of outer-space flight when a hated director at Gattaca is murdered.  Vincent has always been careful to not leave tell-tale evidence - like flaked off skin fragments - but soon Gattaca is crawling with persistant FBI types.  (Interesting that in the future the FBI has gone from only investigating Federal crimes to also doing murder investigations - but I digress.)<br /><br />Although Vincent is innocent of the murder he begins to feel the heat of the investigation as the \\"Hoovers\\" start getting more and more invasive to find the owner of an in-valid eyelash left behind at the \\"perfect\\" workspaces of Gattaca.<br /><br />Uma Thurman is on-hand as well, as another Gattaca employee who was perfect enough to be hired, but whose genetic profile includes an \\"acceptable\\" risk of heart disease.<br /><br />The story has a thought-provoking premise, but as part of my own thought being provoked I came up with the following questions:<br /><br />1. While the FBI has stepped-up responsibilities in this future society, the ACLU seems to have been stamped out.  If discrimination is illegal would a high-profile company be allowed to exist that was made up ENTIRELY of valid executives and in-valid janitors - especially when there are in-valids as smart and ambitious as Vincent?  As the deleted scenes show with a not-included-in-the-film coda: creating a society with only those with perfect genes would have deprived us of John Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln and Albert Einstein.  It's not hard to believe that having perfect people would create discrimination and other undesirable human qualities, but it's difficult to believe that these genetically perfect people would have all their humanity and compassion removed as well.  It's also difficult to believe that this company couldn't recognize that occasionally a \\"god-child\\" could be the next Einstein.<br /><br />2. Okay - I can believe that they would test the genes of a new applicant when they were applying for a new job.  But it costs something to perform these tests, and we're told that in-valids who try the \\"borrowed ladder\\" scam are very rare.  I didn't buy the fact that the company tested ALL of their employees EVERY DAY.  It would just cost too much to enforce the already-illegal discrimination.  This seems like a plot device introduced only to make Vincent's plan more dangerous - like Gattaca has introduced a complicated and expensive screening program only to catch.... HIM!<br /><br />3. Vincent's parents had a valid son after him - believable enough.  But this brother shows back up in the story in a clumsy and contrived manner.  This brother story-line adds nothing to the plot and it interrupted my suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />4. The real murderer of the director is revealed and there's not much surprise in the actual culprit - but the story wraps up the \\"murder mystery\\" subplot so quickly that questions are left unanswered like: we're told that the murderer has had non-violent tendencies genetically engineered out of him, yet he beats another man to death.  Huh?<br /><br />So, Gattaca is both thoughtful and thought-provoking, but I must admit I'd have liked it better if there were less loose ends.  The performances by Hawke and Thurman and Law are all good, as well as Alan Arkin as the most persistent FBI investigator..

B0002OERI0|3.0|Politics aside, this album is alright. It has some good riffs and some intruiging moments of musical compilations. Most of this music takes away from their pop hits, which they are known for. Personally, I have never considered Green Day as a Full Fledged band. Billy Joe comes off slightly immature in this mature sounding album.  <br /> <br />Now with politics. Unfortunately, Green Day has chosen the political Path, and began singing their opinion. You know what, if any of us simpletons CARED about what you celebrities think, we would ask you. Personally, I will not conform to any particular party. But its bands like this, Brittany Spears (for her comment for Pro Bush), and Micheal Moore, that make themselves look like bigger idiots than ever. This album is just another lame voice in a society that looks to the people with the LEAST education, for who or whom they should vote for. Shut up and sing. You make both parties seem like sensless jerks <br /> <br />As I said before, this album is Ok. It's not terrible, but it is not fascinating. Nothing new, just another band that has changed, except this time it's for the worst <br /> <br />P.S. Bands like =w=eezer, Green Day, Blink 182, and Jimmy Eat World, are not Emo or Punk. They Fall under the category of Pop Rock. This does not mean they are bad, JEW and Weezer are my favorite bands, it just means everybody has their categories screwd up
B00005JNEW|4.0|Friday Night Lights depicts the 1988 Season of the Permian Panthers from Odessa Texas.  The film makes clear that Odessa is one of those West Texas towns where high school football is more than the community religion.  Nothing in Odessa matters other than winning the state football championship.  I wonder how the next Einstein or Condoleeza Rice or Colin Powell would react to being raised in such a community. All individual and community self-esteem is tied up in this single-minded goal.  Former Permian players parade around town proudly displaying THEIR state championship rings, and there seems to be no other source of community pride.  There is no sense of the Olympic ideal \\"the essential thing is not to have conquered, but to have fought well\\".  The well-fought fight is not appreciated in Odessa and the film is filled with scenes where Head Coach Gaines (in a wonderful performance by Billy Bob Thornton) is reminded over and over by community leaders that anything less than a state championship is unacceptable.<br /><br />I always wonder about individuals and groups who tie so much of their own happiness to the outcome of sporting events.  Thornton gives us brief glimpses at the idea that Coach Gaines recognizes that even the State Championship Game is, after all, only a game.<br /><br />A group of barely-known actors make up the team.  We recognize the more grownup Lucas Black (the kid from \\"Sling Blade\\") once again paired with Billy Bob, this time as the quarterback filled with self-doubts, even as he leads the Panthers to the State play-offs.  Derek Luke brings his chiseled body to the part of Boobie Miles, the star running back who is on the fast track to the NFL - until he tears his knee up with a mixture of bad luck and bravado.  Grover Coulson is terrific as Boobie's Uncle L.V., who took over raising the young man after Boobie's parents were out of the picture.  L.V. clearly wants what's best for Boobie, but you can also see that he knows Boobie is so close to the NFL and it's riches that he can taste it. The most heartbreaking scene in the film comes after Boobie is evaluated by an out of town Orthopedist who tells Boobie that his ACL is torn and he won't be able to cut any more, then Boobie and L.V. get together to mislead Coach Gaines into thinking that Boobie will be able to play.<br /><br />Garrett Hedlund stars as the other running back with a tendency to drop the ball and with an abusive alcoholic father who flashes his own State Championship Ring between drunken fits of child abuse.  Tim McGraw continues the Billy Bob connection by having another well-known country singer playing a scumbag.  (Following Sling Blades' Dwight Yoakum.) The DVD includes a documentary about the \\"real\\" Panthers and suggests that the \\"real\\" Charles Billingsley was only intense rather than an abusive drunk.<br /><br />The film is shot like a documentary, and it was about 15 minutes into the movie before it started feeling like a movie at all.  This adds to the \\"realism\\", but also creates a little shakiness to the viewing experience as hand-held camera shots wiggle the main characters through the frame.<br /><br />I knew nothing about the \\"real\\" story before seeing the film, but it is clear that you are moving toward a State Championship Game - and early on you see that the opponents are going to be a team from Dallas made up of players that look like they outweight the Panthers by about 50 pounds per player.  The Panther's trip to the big game hits a few speed bumps while the team from Dallas looks like an unbeatable behemoth.<br /><br />By the end of the film I had the reassuring sense that as a result of this season the community of Odessa had a better appreciation for the \\"well fought fight\\".

B000127LW2|4.0|Voyager was really an excellent series from the start. <br />With a superb teaser, great casting and a wonderful premise for a series, the series starts as Voyager and a Marquis ship are propelled half-way across the galaxy by an unknown force. <br />Forced to destroy the technology responsible for causing the ship to be brought there, so begins the series as Voyager sets off home for Earth with a 70 year journey ahead of her. <br />The joining of the Starfleet and Marquis crews together make for some interesting stories and early tension, particuarly in this early series. <br />The crew is also joined by an alien, a talaxian known as \\" Neelix\\" who takes great delight in giving the Vulcan Security office \\" Tuvok\\" a hard time. Their interaction is reminiscent of Bones and Spock from the original series. <br />Neelix has a partner an Ocampan female called \\" Kes \\" a species that only lives for 9 years.  <br />The Captain, \\" Janeway\\" the first female lead in all the Star Trek series, is another great cast. She is very strong, but also very fair with her desicions. She decides to make the head of the Marquis, an ex Starfleet Officer her first Officer. His name is Chakotay. He is an Indian, and makes a very interesting character in the coming seasons. He is very softy spoken, but has real prescence. <br />Another interesting addition is an ex convict, ex Starfleet, ex Marquis, who becomes the conn officer. Tom Paris as he's known, is an excellent pilot, who finds it hard to initially be part of the team. <br />Rounding out the senior crew and main characters is a fresh Ensign, Harry Kim, just out of Starfleet, a half Klingon female ( who hates her Klingon part ! )she's an ex Marquis, who becomes the chief Engineer, and finally a Holographic doctor, known only as \\" The Doctor\\" who is activated as the ships real Doctor was killed in the first episode. <br />The hologram was initially only intended as an Emergency to supplement the normal crew, or in the real Doctors absense. <br />His struggle with finding an identity is one of the real high lights of the show, in the vein of \\" Data\\" from the next Generation. <br />The opportunities for story lines from all this lot are almost endless! <br />Although a short season ( Just 16 episodes )there is barely a bad episode. \\" Learning Curve\\" probably just takes the cake for this being ever so corny, and a somewhat disappointing end to the first season. <br />The number of excellent quality episodes is amazing. <br />\\" Caretaker\\" the opening was an excellent start to the series, which sets up the ship, crew and location for the new and old veiwer of Star Trek alike. <br />\\" Eye of the Needle\\" was a great story about finding a small wormhole that offered hope to the crew for finding a way home. <br />\\" Ex Post Facto\\" was interesting story, with a legal twist as the conn officer Tom Paris is punished for an alleged murder on a planet. <br />\\" Prime Factors\\" also pushed the ethical side of the crew as they debate whether to violate their prime directive of not interfering with another species development or to abuse the  trust and respect provided by another species. <br />\\" Jetrel\\" is the first \\" Neelix\\" episode with bite, as he faces the creator of a weapon that destroyed much of his race, including his family. <br />All in all, this is a superb series, and worth watching from the start. Having just watched them all again recently, you really appreciate the character development, and the continuity the show manages to portray. <br />A worth while additon, with added bonus features, make this well worth it! <br /> <br />Thanks for reading.. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009ML238|5.0|Dear Reader <br /> <br />If you enjoy listening to Dream Theater, Symphony X, Pagans Mind, Shadow Gallery and such band you should definately check out this killer album. <br /> <br />The album was released here in Norway the 14th of may 2005 and my copy has been in my CD player ever since, I just can't stop listening to this excellent piece of work, only a few albums have been visiting before the 1st chapter hi-jacks the CD player again. <br /> <br />Circus Maximus ( [...] ) is a norwegian band containing 5 excellent musicians. The band is influenced by a wide variety of music and you can easy hear the influences from time to time, but still they do not clone their inspirations. They have a unique blend/mixture of the influences and thus gives a fresh breath into the progressive metal scene. <br /> <br />I'm giving this album 5 stars of 5 possible and sure do hope that you enjoy the album, at least almost as much as I do. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. :-D <br /> <br />Best regards <br />Simon - Norway
B0000C6E4D|3.0|sarah mclachlan is from one of my favorite artists. i was dissapointed with afterglow. her earlier album 'mirrorball' is probably the best album i have ever had. her songs in afterglow are like Dido type songs. i like dido but i think sarah mclachlans songs are far more sophtisticated than hers. i hope her next album will be more powerfull than this last one.
B0007GAERG|1.0|I also love the old Mariah, but this album is just DULL!  Yes, she has gone back to her old sound somewhat.  She has also reduced the appearance of the rappers constantly present on Glitter.  I'm even glad that she's gotten rid of the silly album titles (Glitter, Charmbracelet?).  But overall, this just puts me to sleep!  The only songs worth listening to are the two singles!!  Like the other negative reviews are saying, I also agree that this sounds just like any other R&B you can hear on the Top 40.  It's nothing new, nothing different.  As much as I hate to say it, this is Mariah's worst album.  It's so bad, it actually makes me like Charmbracelet!!
B00092ZMDY|3.0|THE EAGLES ALONG WITH AEROSMITH ARE AMERICA'S GREATEST BANDS. THE FAREWELL 1 BROADCAST WAS OK. DON FELDER WHO LAUNCHED THE EAGLES TO A HARDER EDGIER SOUND AFTER JOINING THE BAND IN'73 WAS DEFINATELY MISSING ON THIS PARTICULAR TOUR. ALSO ADDING HORNS TO ALL THE SONGS AND THE ADDITION OF A FIDDLE [VIOLIN!!] JUST TOTALLY SCREWED UP THE SONGS. IF IT'S NOT ON THE ORIGINAL RECORDING, DON'T ADD INSTRUMENTS. LISTEN TO THE LIVE DISC ON THE SELECTED WORKS CD AND THE 1980 EAGLES LIVE CD TO SEE HOW VALUABLE FELDER IS. THIS DVD WILL BE FOR DIE-HARDS, I'VE PRE-ORDERED IT, BUT GLENN & DON NEED TO RE-FOCUS THE FUTURE OF THE MUSIC IN CASE THEIR IS A FAREWELL 2 TOUR.
B0007XH5OY|5.0|Jeff Beck's debut solo album has never sounded better in this mid-price expanded/remaster.As you know,this album was the first full-length recording of Rod Stewart.The group was a supergroup;guitarist Jeff Beck,vocalist Rod Stewart,bassist Ron Wood,Keyboardist Nicky Hopkins and drummer Micky Waller(who later played on some of Rod's best solo albums).For this release,EMI gives you all the expected bonus tracks and then some.You get previously unreleased outtake versions of \\"Blues DeLuxe\\" & \\"You Shook Me\\"(both remixed from the original multitracks),the original UK mono single version of \\"Beck's Bolero\\"(yes,as we're aware,there's no stereo mix of this track,which was recorded in 1966,shortly after Jeff's previous band The Yardbirds had completed their \\"Roger The Engineer\\" album,but the Uk single version has a backwards guitar coda which was edited off all album and previous CD releases of the song).Incidentally,\\"Beck's Bolero\\" was recorded with Keith Moon,John Paul Jones,Jimmy Page & Nicky Hopkins.Also,you get first-time-in stereo 2005 remixes of \\"I've Been Drinking\\",\\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\" & \\"Rock My Plimsoul\\"(the first version;the single take with Aynsley Dunbar on drums).The new remix of \\"I've Been Drinking\\" corrects a problem present on the original mono mix which caused a rejected,alternate lyric Rod Stewart vocal to leak through in the part of the song after the guitar solo.The unwanted vocal has now been 95% squelched.The stereo remix of \\"Rock My Plimsoul\\" is fine and musically identical to the mono single,however,it should be cautioned that due to some live-during-mono mixdown guitar & vocal overdubs on the original mono single mix of \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\",that the new stereo remix is missing one of the three lead guitar parts during the guitar solo,and the high vocal harmonies are missing during the song's choruses.The disc also includes the original mono single mixes of \\"Tallyman\\" & \\"Love is Blue\\".My guess is that either EMI couldn't find the multitracks for those two selections,or they did find them,but found a sitation similar to the situation on \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\";that musically identical(to the original single) stereo mixes weren't possible.There's long been talk that EMI funded further Jeff Beck recording sessions after Jeff's contract with EMI had ended,but before Jeff signed wih EPIC worldwide,but that there's uncertainty about whether EMI can legally release the recordings.When Jeff's manager has enquired about the recordings,EMI's Abbey Road Studios tape vault has denied holding them,though compilers who have done projects for EMI have said otherwise.I hope that someday that ownership issue will be resolved.Until then,EMI/UK's new expanded reissues of \\"Truth\\" & \\"Beck-Ola\\" give us more Jeff Beck outtakes than we'd ever thought we would hear.Jeff has always been anti-nostalgia & anti-outtakes,but his rigidness seems to be softening.He's even cooperated and been interviewed for the (fine) liner notes which accompany both discs.Highly recommended.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is the comedy, I am looking for! Team America is funny but the reality of today's politics and American public. You will see many familiar characters and enjoy their ideas. Michael Moore and Sean Penn is just the few. While wathing it, You will see the stupidness of average, cheap American Movie culture and laugh on it. If you still have not seen it, BUY it and SEE!!!
B00097DX3U|5.0|If you are a straight ahead rock and roll fan \\"Out of Exile\\" is a great addition to your collection. Well arranged and great lyrics!
B0007XT87G|4.0|The Good<br /><br />The title track \\"Deadwing\\" clocks in at nine minutes. Porcupine Tree builds anticipation with an electronic pulsing beat that gives way to pounding drums and thick guitar licks. Just when you think the track is winding down, it comes back at you with a killer guitar soloing. Guitarist/vocalist Steven Wilson must have been taking notes during his production sessions with Opeth, because the riffs on \\"Shallow\\" are pure heavy metal. They mix well with the clean interludes. Wilson's vocals are echoed, yet melodic. With the blending of acoustic guitars and piano on \\"Lazarus\\", it seems that Steven had some left over material from his Blackfield side project.<br /><br />The song evokes plenty of emotion and sincerity. Porcupine Tree flex their artsy progressive side on \\"Arriving Somewhere (But Not Here)\\". The effects heavy, indulgent introduction guides you to Wilson's serene vocals and acoustic guitar work. About half way through this twelve minute piece, they kick up the distortion with chunky riffs and a driving drum beat instrumental. As soon as the band pumps you up, they bring you right back down. The hidden track is built around watery guitar tones; wah injected licks, and harmonized vocals.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />Nothing<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Porcupine Tree cannot be defined by one genre due to their vast textures of music. This is evident after listening to their latest album. Deadwing shows that Porcupine Tree doesn't just rock you; they calm you, and take you on a thought-provoking journey as well.
B000929AJQ|3.0|As every review, I have to state this: I am long time NIN fan, I love The Fragile and every other major release dearly, but With Teeth has tons of mixed feelings with me. <br /> <br />The first time I listened to it all the way through, I thought, \\"Wow! I love this, it's great! Way to go, Trent.\\" But now when it works it's way into my playlist, I find myself skipping tracks... Something's just missing. I saw some one compare the lyric writing to a 16-year-old boy... It feels like blasphemy, but at some points in the album, I almost have to agree. <br /> <br />At any rate, the album is appealing musically, and Trent's voice is almost enough to make up for the songwriting (even though the material/topics of some of the songs is appealing, the way it is presented is not). <br /> <br />It's not a bad album... It's just no Downward Spiral.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Ok I've been reading all these reviews by people who say \\"I thought rock music in the 2000's was dead until I heard this album.\\"  If it were true that rock music was dead then this supergroup would represent a few last gasps leftover from the 90s.  But rock music is not dead!  And I'm not referring to all the waste these other reviewers mention, bands like Nickelback, System of a Down, Linkin Park etc.  Those guys are pathological symptoms not of dead rock but dead RADIO.  It's not that there isn't great music out there, it's that it can be hard to find for people stuck with MTV and Clear Channel.  Bands like The Mars Volta, The Postal Service, Arcade Fire, even sugary Interpol and Franz Ferdinand are but a few examples of how there's as much quality music today as at any point in the now-nostalgic 90s.  It may not all sound like 1994 grunge, but Soundgarden didn't sound like 1984 Van Halen either. <br />Anyway, back to the Audioslave album in question: It's Soundgarden warmed over: a well done album that may be a slight departure for the members of RATM but one that fails to freshen up Chris Cornell's earlier work.  Enjoy these bands' earlier albums and then find something new and more innovative.
B000000OAC|5.0|The real gems on here are \\"All Dead\\", \\"Spread Your Wings\\", and \\"Who Needs You\\".  There are more of course, but this album really showcases some of the great Queen songs that didn't chart, therfore they aren't really known to casual radio listeners.  But us Queen fans know the score, right boys?!  This album is great great great.  But it used or go to hell!
B000003C2U|4.0|While this isn't my favorite Death ablum, this is still pretty damn good. There is no bad Death album -pretty rare for any band.  <br /> <br />I thought about giving this CD three stars but then thought that this was way better then Scream Bloody Gore, but not in my opinion as good as Leprosy, Spiritual Healing or Individual Thought Patterns. Let me explain.  <br /> <br />Human represents a transitional phase of Death, they weren't quite as technically accomplished as they needed to be to play the music they wanted to play. This is evidenced by his enlisting of Steve DiGiorgio (ex-Sadus, Autopsy, Testament) and to a lesser extend the later Cynic skins man Sean Reinert.  <br /> <br />The guitars of Paul Masvidal and Chuck are the best part. The guitars are the best (and most technical) instrument on the album. Digiorgio's bass is okay, but in later years (like one or two) he would become a tremendously good bassist in the realm of people like Jaco Pastorius (hard feat). Some of the interludes during the intros and breaks are cool (like mini-bass solos). I think Steve, since he was \\"borrowed\\" from Sadus, hadn't quite mixed properly with the Death team. Team Sadus apparently wasn't happy with him going over to the other coast, guess they wanted to work on 'A Vision of Misery'. The drumming has its moments, but for the most part, is like all the other drumming at the time. Whoa, talk about overusing the double-bass function including straight-rolls and explosion beats! Couldn't get out of that 4 timing? Granted some of the intros are okay...just a drummer of a quarter of a century venting here. <br /> <br />A good thing here too is Chuck's voice is becoming less offensive. In an album like SBG it sounded either too forced or unnatural where here it sounds and blends in so well with the music. A little too much treble in the end production also. Another interesting note is how subdued the second half of the album is compared to Death metal standards back in the day.  <br/> <br />Like all the other Death albums, I recommend you buy this one with the rest of the entire collection. There is not one bad Death album (one or two okay ones) and many Great Death albums. <br />And with a band like this that can write a good song, it makes them one of the more listenable bands of the genre.  <br />(Goes without saying: R.I.P. Chuck)
B00008J2UE|5.0|Let's Shake Hands and Lafayette Blues are the 2 bonus tracks.  The bonus tracks were previously released on the UK Import Single - Fell In Love With A Girl Part 1. <br /> <br />Here is my review of the U.S. version of the album: <br /> <br />Here is the first effort of the next age in rock,  Jack and Meg White push off hard with this effort.  You really need to see the progression of greatness in this band, so start here and then go on to De Stijl and Cells and know you are onto something incredible here. <br /> <br />One reviewer said \\"White Stripes' is completely unselfconscious-- it's just two kids honestly following their instincts and influences, yet creating an original.\\"  He's right, The Stripes don't sound like anybody else (no matter how hard you try to draw parallels).  Jack is brilliant live too.....just yelling out in the middle of a song \\"Buddy Holly is dead and there is nothing you and I can do about it!\\" or ranting about an \\"insane Elvis\\" leads you to believe it's all stream-of-thought rantings anyway (and that would include the music).Legions of other bands will be compared to them, not the other way around. <br /> <br />In Jimmy you honestly think Jack's guitar is going to explode......there just isn't any room for bass and rhythm in this sound.....how can one guy sound like System Of A Down, Metallica, or Rush all by himself?  Big Three, Bricks.....there is this incredible run of three killer tracks - Wasting My Life/Cannon/Astro that makes you want to scream how good rock and roll can be......honestly, there is way too much sound here for two people.....it's the sound of an original rock lightning strike......it's rare......there hasn't been a band like this one in 10 years.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I'm a musician who has lived in the States for 15 years, I still play professionally. I don't think the cover does this one justice...it looks too generic, but I bought it because I was told it was something really good. There's no doubt it is - what I like most is this album doesn't seem to try too hard, it just gives you some really top class songs presented as good as anyone can do. <br /> <br />I thought it was technically up there with anything I have like Josh Groban or Sara Brightman, but perhaps not as self-absorbed as a lot of artists. I love Irish Traditional music and I play classical and this hits the mark somewhere in between - I'm temped to say even a new classic-Irish sound I haven't heard quite like this. <br /> <br />Top notch playing and top notch singing. Excellent! Even my kids like it...or is it the girls?!!
B00003CXXP|5.0|This is an amazing film! I cannot express the haunting pain, sorrow and joy this film brought to it's veiwer. It is deeply troubling, and extremely dark and intelligent.  <br /> <br />This is yet another hit by the best film director of all time. Kudos to Mr. Spielburg, the king of filmaking.
B00027JYLC|4.0|I had heard a lot of Todd Browning's Freaks over the years, but I had never seen it.  The answer is, Yes, the film is very disturbing.  It is disturbing because it uses actors who are really deformed.  Yet, it treats those actors like real people.   <br /> <br />The story concerns a hapless little person who has just inherited a lot of money.  An evil trapeze artist seduces him away from his fiance and marries him.  Her plan is to poison him and take all his money.  When his fellow \\"freaks\\" find out about this, they take terrible revenge. <br /> <br />What is scary about this film is what is not shown.  The climatic chase at the end - where the freaks chase the bad guys through a rain storm - is disturbing because you can only imagine what they will do to them when they catch them.  The payoff left me disappointed however.  We know from the beginning that they somehow turn the villainess into a freak.  In my mind, her fate was too horrible to contemplate.  On screen, it earns a laugh.  It would be more frightening if we never see what happens to her.  The happy ending with the little couple reuniting feels tacked-on.   <br /> <br />This is a movie no one ever forgets watching.  It shows the direction horror would go in the future.  Had it been made in the seventies, it would have been much more gruesome; however, I can't imagine any modern-day filmmakers (with the exception of the Farrely brothers) who would use real deformed people. <br /> <br /> <br />
1592400876|5.0|It makes me so happy that someone else gets as irritated about incorrect punctuation as I do. I wish I had bought this book sooner - my life is better now.
B00005RYL2|5.0|Highlander is a classic.  I just popped this in the dvd player today and it still looks magnificent after 20 years.  More importantly, the sound quality is great - the sound designers on this movie did an excellent job, and putting this movie on DVD adds power to the viewing experience.  Not to mention Queen's unique killer rock soundtrack which was tailored for the film (a rarity in any movie these days)<br /><br />In spite of the TV series, animation and sequels - Highlander the movie really stands alone.  Russell Mulcahy did such a fantastic job on the visual storytelling - that Highlander still ranks high in my books as an action film and should be watched by fans and students of the genre.  Forget the overblown effects of movies like Matrix - this has real swordplay, great scenarios, personality and humour.  All this makes the movie inspiring to watch.<br /><br />Highlander also captures the peak of Christopher Lambert and bad guy Clancy Brown, who defines badness as the immortal villain Kurgen.  Sean Connery cuts a dashing figure as well.  All are perfectly cast.<br /><br />How and why Russell's epic vision faltered in the sequel to this great film is anyone's guess.  But the original Highlander will remain a classic for years to come.
B0007P0LO8|3.0|This supposedly new release from Deutsche Grammophon is actually the same 1974 production previously released under the Decca label in 2001. That older title is still available at Amazon. This is a film version, not a stage production. It was directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and starred some of the finest performers available at the time. The great Herbert von Karajan conducts the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and Vienna State Opera. It is without question a magnificient performance. Mirella Freni sings the role of Butterfly as few others can match. Placido Domingo is in equally fine form. Christa Ludwig is excellent as Suzuki. And yet the film as a whole doesn't really work. The trouble is that while Ponnelle tries to make this into a movie version of Butterfly, he neither has the resources nor the capability for doing so. The staging looks decidedly cheap, lacklustre and as some have commented, tacky. An effective movie version would benefit from realistic settings, a real house on a hill, with a sparkling Bay beneath. It could have done without some of the sensationalist/ridiculous set directions, like having Domingo jump out through the paper walls of the house, ostensibly for dramatic effect. This production could have worked (indeed would have been a triumphant success) if filmed purely as a stage based opera. However Ponnelle's final choice puts it neither here nor there. We have sets that look like they belong on stage (and not a very good stage at that), yet the performers are made to act as if they were in a movie. We get to see Placido Domingo chewing gum while he contemplates marrying Cio Cio San, presumably to show what a cad he is. And he continues to chew gum even while he's supposed to be singing. While this is still set in 19th century Japan, Domingo is seen to wear an obviously 20th century T-shirt. Domingo can act far better than what is shown here. As for the singing, the performances are all dubbed post-production. Lip synching ranges from poorto laughable. Because this is supposed to be a movie, and not a staged opera, we get the truly unbelieveable sight of these great performers singing without having to open their mouths - as we are supposed to be hearing their thoughts. Again, this could work provided the director is able to convince the audience that they are in a realistic film world. Unfortunately we are never transported into that world, we are all too aware that this is an opera sung on stage, albeit lip-synched.    The original Decca DVD sported a very soft, grainy transfer in fullscreen (pan & scan), littered with dirt specks and film nicks, looking very much like a poor quality VHS tape and this DG reissue looks no different. I can do without the DTS remix. This was recorded in stereo and the original release, in addition to a Dolby 5.0 surround, already had an excellent uncompressed Linear PCM audio track with quality equivalent to that of a good CD.    The original Decca release received mixed reviews. Aurally it is superb, one of the finest Butterflies ever. Visually it is close to a disaster. If you believe opera is only meant to be listened to, then this will be a top choice. If you believe opera should be an experience for both the eyes and ears, then pass this by. Even today, I still play the old Decca DVD, but only to listen to. I leave the TV off.      Note: It's not strictly correct to say that the singers were dubbed post-production. This movie has a curious history. It began as an audio-only studio recording with the exact same cast except that Luciano Pavarotti sang the role of Pinkerton. That recording was made in early 1974 at the Sofiensaal in Vienna. It received critical acclaim. The decision to make a movie using that original recording as a soundtrack came later that year. For the movie, they re-recorded Placido Domingo in the role as Pinkerton and spliced it into the earlier recording of the original cast. So the performers are in fact miming or lip-synching to the pre-recorded music while the film was being shot.
B00001OH7P|5.0|A great hard rocking album with a  weird wonderful story line. <br />This album is jam packed with songs that hit the charts and stand well on their own yet the album is somewhat of  mini opera. Although the term rock opera has become a bit hackneyed I believe the label fits in this case.   Even though its songs are each complete units together they make up a story that is in my mind more cohesive than \\"Tommy\\". I am a big fan of \\"Tommy \\" and don't mean to take away from what an accomplishment that album is nor am I saying  that one album is better than another rather I am  just saying that as a little opera  \\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\\"  really fits the bill. <br /> <br />Many  have  become so used to listening  to some of the hits from this album that perhaps they have not looked deeper into the album as a whole. <br /> <br />The album was made at the time of  a second sexual revolution when transgenderism, transsexualism, cross dressing  and  homosexuality were a common topic. Although I  was around when this album first came out I am not sure which came first- whether this album  ushered in new life styles or came from a synthesis of the times. Although I was not a \\"glam rocker\\" nor as they say a \\"gender bender\\" any one could see then that  this album if not  helping to usher in the period  certainly was a type of touch stone. <br /> <br />The album was released in 1972, just a few years after the first moon landing and when  Saturn V rockets were still  sending our astronauts on  moon missions. We were collectively looking up into the heavens and with the science and excitement  of space exploration the topic of UFOs were also in full bloom. It was also a few years after the 60's decade of love, experimentation  and psychedelics and that too is reflected in this album. <br /> <br />In short the album is about an effeminate space man coming to earth at a time of rock and  roll and planetary self destruction.  It  paints a gloomypicture of  a doomed world  but offers hope with the appearance of a rock and roll alien. <br /> <br />The first song \\"Five Years\\" is somewhat of a preface to the appearance of Ziggy Stardust telling of the coming apocalypse. But what is beautifully literate about the song is that it is reflection on what would be lost  if the Earth should come to and end. Basically it bemoans the difficulty  of summing up our what life on the planet was all about.  The song asks the question  what would we do if we were told  everything were to come to  an end in five years. <br /> <br />As the album goes on a starman appears (Ziggy). It is not clear what his appearance signals - perhaps he is here to save the world. If it is it is through rock and roll. By the end of the album the  world does  not come to an end, indeed at least to my interpretation  the end was averted, but Ziggy the starman gets drawn into the world of rock and roll and its vices and he meets his end. There maybe some \\"Christ symbolism\\" afoot here. <br /> <br />To my ear the most famous song  Suffragette City is its most perplexing. Musically one of the most flawless rock songs of all time I still after many years of listening to this album have no clue as to what the lyric of the song means. It sounds  as though it is referring to the frenetic pace of a life of the rock star but what this has to do with suffragettes is still a mystery to me. <br /> <br />If you are familiar with a few of the tunes from the album which bombarded the radio waves when they first came out but have never listened to the entire album be sure to give it a listen. <br /> <br />Jim Connell <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I have forever been a huge Phantom fan, and was thrilled to be able to see it on stage a few years ago... one of the highlights of my LIFE!!! I had planned to rush out and see this movie, but I waited. It was just on PPV and I watched it with my two teenaged sons and their friend... I was mesmerized... I  actually got goosebumps many times, and the boys watched almost in silence the whole 2 1/2 hours. I never cared much for Raoul (sp?) either, but when he has that rope around his neck and he's singing... whew! And yes, that Phantom WAS HOT!!! :-)) Ohhh to be Christine!
B000002OMN|4.0|I originally bought Bat Out Of Hell simply because I'm a huge fan of Rocky Horror and rock music and thought that maybe I would like Meatloaf. Since buying the album he has become one of my 3 favourite bands (the other two being Guns n Roses and Metallica). I bought Bat Out Of Hell 2 hoping for more songs like Bat Out Of Hell, You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth, and Paradise by the Dashboard Light. <br />I wasnt sure about spending $35.00 on this cd but after hearing Life Is a Lemon I knew I had made the right choice. Around half the songs on the cd arent really my cup of tea but I love the other songs so much it makes my $35.00 worthwhile. <br />I'm not too fond of the slower songs (I'd Do anything for love but I wouldnt do that; and Objects In The Rearview Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are, etc.) and maybe that's my age showing through (I'm 14) but like I said before, I'm so in love with Life Is A Lemon and Everything Louder Than Everything Else that I will put up with having to skip most of the other songs. <br />Whether you're into the slower Meatloaf songs or the faster ones, I would definitely recommend this cd :-)
B00003CWTI|5.0|magnolia is about many things, but what most people bemoan and lament over is that it is about 3 hours long - give or take.  another major point of stricture concerns the ostensibly melodramatic elements in each of the characters - all of which are amplified to impossible decibles, cascading in plaintive waves throughout the entire picture.  but what i think is missed in a mere tentative view of the film, one which is without heavy scrutiny and reliant upon impulse more than intellect, is that magnolia is completely aware of its more maudlin moments and even casts a facetious eye upon them.  the common calls of self-absorption that have been slung at the film's director are without base and entirely inappropriate in the context of the film.  the very fact that paul thomas anderson can underscore the more dramatic moments of the film with a nudging levity (as in the scene where the entire cast begins to sing along to a song on the soundtrack) proves that he isn't trying to elevate himself to some plateau of absurd pomposity. <br /> <br />the film is hardly without precedent.  certainly an antecedent can be found in the work of robert altman, most notably his classic film \\"short cuts.\\"  but whereas altman's film was a tale of intersecting stories without a centrifugal sense of commonality, nothing to really link their stories together except randomness and chance encounters, anderson's film is decidedly more ambitious in that it uses the past to accentuate the ubiquity of the characters and their collective problems.   <br /> <br />all of the characters are bound irrevocably to some past transgression, a breach and moment of defiance that they have yet to lend closure to.  all of the characters are under this constraint with the exception of john c. reilly's police officer - whom we accompany along for the ride, playing a sort of collective surrogate for television crews and cameras found in shows like cops.  reilly's character rambles on in the kind of matter-of-factloquacity that is the hallmark of said reality programs, done by anderson to stress that we are indeed in a film - as he does at several other junctures.   <br /> <br />the film begins with the narrator regaling the audience with a series of stories which involve peculiar coincidences.  he begins to say that these incidents go beyond mere chance, and that they are not \\"one of those things\\" that just happen, apropos of nothing.  it is implied that there is perhaps some intricate patchwork of divine doing that links us, and that there is in these occurences, proof that no event is isolated or inconsequential.  the duration of the film is spent leading up to a conclusion that either refutes or affirms that previous hypothesis of the narrator, in accordance with how you view the film. <br /> <br />i'll refrain from making the vain attempt of explaining in detail the goings on and numerous stories in the film.  i think nearly all of that is evident to the people perusing through these customer reviews.   <br /> <br />as opposed to speaking in terms of plot or story, i'd instead rather write about the most infamous scene in the film, the scene (alert to all ye who have been stowed away in a dank pit for the past 6 years and are unaware of the much-publicized/ridiculed event in the film, there is a spoiler coming on, so ye'd do best to cover yer nubile ears) where it quite clearly rains frogs.  as has been noted by many of the film's adherents (sycophantic slags we unashamedly are) the number 82 is recurrent in the film, manifest in the coil of a garden hose atop a desolate tenement where a young, virile gentleman leaped to his own death, on posterboards in the audience of a game show, in the weather report (82 degrees), and many other things i probably missed, being the inattentive dolt that i am.  all of this is in reference to (get out your junior bibles, children) an exodus passage 8:2 which states \\"and if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs,\\" which alludes to the liberation of  <br />the jews from the egyptians, which commenced with said raining of frogs.  allegedly anderson was unaware of this passage until it was brought to his attention prior to filming, due to this coincidence (funny, when dealing with a movie that questions the nature of coincidence) he worked in the references to exodus.  allegedly what really inspired the inclusion of the frogs were the writings of fort, which dealt with strange phemomena (and whose work is being read by the young genius in the film during one scene in the library).  also, it was given inspiration from a piece of medical history that it was once thought to be capable of assessing the general health of a town by examining its amphibian members.   <br /> <br />whether or not the falling of the frogs symbolizes the liberation of the characters from their past (i'm of that opinion) or whether or not the ending petains to the refutation of the importance or significance of coincidence is highly irrelevant, because as the caption on the painting towards the end (painted by fiona apple) indicates, it did indeed happen.  whether or not there was any preternatural reason for its happening or whether it is just \\"one of those things that happen\\" and coincidence is merely empty and coincidental, bereft of any divine connotations, is left entirely to the viewer.  it is in this confidence and in this design that magnolia ascends to a true masterwork, and discerns itself as one of the defining moments in american film.  a film bristling with an indefatigable vivacity and sense of life that under no condition compromises itself and presents one of the greatest most kinetic and kaleidoscopic visions of contemporary american life is deserving of my utmost reverence.
B00003000M|5.0|The artists that are on this posthumous tribute to Bob Marley give the listener a soulful treat without distroying the body of the songs as it often happens when musican's attempt to re-do a great piece of music.  Of course, the orignals will NEVER have an equal....
B00009W0U4|4.0|I have been on a mission to watch the most \\"disturbing\\" films ever made and this title kept being referenced so i checked it out.  I liked it!  Most of the other movies i have seen recently have been pure dissappointments, some a little shocking but mostly they get their \\"disturbing\\" status do to one scene usually involving a rape.  Well this movie as most of you surely know (WARNING SPOILERS) has a rape in it followed by a coma inducing beating but that one scene isnt all this movie is about.  This movie has so much more to offer.  It plays backwards similarly to momento, now this movie isnt as clever as momento but it has something else, something dirty, something gritty, something ..... DIFFERENT and thats what makes this movie good.  This movie is subtitled for those of use who are French impaired and thats a good thing because it your eyes were fixed on the swirling camera too long youd probably loose your lunch.  Now the squeemish may loose thier lunch for other reasons such as man sex, brutal beatings, rape and trany dick but for those of us who are fascinated by things we havent seen before you will find this movie thrilling.  Im going to play the role here of dumb American and admit that it took me a few scenes to figure out what the hell was going on and try and figure out who was who but by the time i had it figured out i really began to enjoy what was going on here.  The dialogue in parts is a little lengthy and drawn out (train scene) but so much of the film is the exact opposite where it sends you whirling through some wild parts of life you and I will never see and its for those scenes that i applaud the film.  I wont say this is a great movie because it is anticlimactic and because it plays backwards you dont feel anything for the characters when you should be feeling something for or about them but i will say this about the film .... if watching it doesnt immediately make you want to watch it again then this was never the kind of movie for you in the first place.  Not for everyone but the daring should enjoy this flick.
1594200106|4.0|I was completely taken with this book, but, like other reviewers, I believed it could have been shorter. That said, the ending was a huge disappointment to me. It was a typical soap opera-ish ending that didn't belong in so finely written a story. It almost seemed as if the author tried too hard for that slam-bam bestseller finish when his story was more literary in nature than that; it was too long drawn out, and, by the end, seemed almost pointless.<br /><br />However, the descriptions of Franco-era Spain were wonderful, beautifully drawn, and quite believable. His description of the 'Cemetery of Dead Books' was another wonderful addition that wasn't utilized nearly enough.
B000000W5F|4.0|Were there to be fractional ratings for us reviewers to use, a score of 3.5 would be a more accurate assessment of how I feel about this album.  However, since you can only rate using whole numbers here, I chose to round up to 4 stars instead of rounding down to 3.  As the title I chose says, this is indeed the Stones last better-than-average album - notice I don't say great.  Because of the Stones' legacy and track record of making a string of some of the indisputably best records of the rock & roll genre all the way from the early '60's to the late '70's and taking into consideration their enormous and incalculable contribution to the history of rock & roll and late-20th century pop culture, the bar is set rather high for them when the issue of rating individual records comes into the equation.  More than half the songs on this album are of at least above average quality with a couple being great but not excellent.  In spite of the fact of this album being essentially a collection of tracks not included on albums recorded as far back as the early '70's with a peppering of a few then-new songs recorded for this album and not a studio album in the purest sense being recorded within a resonably short span of time where the lyrics both as they are written and sung along with the individual and collective musicianship of the band in question, it still stands as a damn good Stones' album and actually better than it may have been received at the time of its release.  The few 5-star worthy tracks (the 2 biggest sinles \\"Start Me Up\\" and \\"Waiting On A Friend\\" whose videos enjoyed heavy rotation during MTV's first year or two being a couple) on this album redeem the other at-most better-than-average offerings --the Keith Richards' vocal track being the one dud-- and save the record as a whole from being merely average.  Had this album been written, recorded, engineered, mixed and mastered during one studio session over one contiguous period of time and not as a patchwork drawing from unreleased tracks recorded as far back as a decade earlier, this might have been a great album as opposed to better-than-average.  Having said that, because of their stature as rock & roll standard bearers, a better-than-average Stones' album is better than most artists' best album. Most bands are lucky to have even one average album, let alone a string of consistently superb albums one after the other over a period spanning a decade and a half - an arguably unequalable feat the Stones' managed to acheive.       As a humorous side-note, I wonder if anyone else found the irony in a recent Stones' song entitled \\"Don't Stop\\".  Compare it with Tattoo You's \\"Start Me Up\\", a song that captures male libido as it transitions from the waning days of youthfulness to the approach of middle-age whereas the title for \\"Don't Stop\\" seems apprpriate for a bunch of guys entering their golden years in the age of Viagra.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears has become a living legend and her fourth studio release, 2003's breakthrough In the Zone, definitley shows us why.  From her Grammy-winning hit \\"Toxic\\" featuring real strings and one of the most addictive beats in history to sex-sizzlin' should-be single \\"Breathe On Me,\\" In the Zone was 2003 and even 2004's best vocal pop album, hands down.  Its scintillating rhythms and edgy lyrical phrasing make this record as hot as hot can get, proving Britney's musical power to persuade.  But even though Zone's much-hyped up feel is its strong suit, its two ballads - self-penned single \\"Everytime\\" and co-written track \\"Shadow\\" (that also should've been a hit) - show the softer side of the pop superstar.  On the dancefloor or in your favorite chair brooding to music for relaxation, In the Zone is the album to buy.
B000001Y2U|5.0|But it was worth it!<br />Boasting a fuller sound and a more focused sense of purpose, Antichrist Superstar is a substantial improvement on Marilyn Manson's debut album, Portrait of an American Family. The band draws equally from schlock-metal, progressive metal, new wave, goth-rock and industrial rock, and with the help of producers Trent Reznor and Dave Ogilvie, the group creates a boiling, mockingly satanic mess of guitars, and synthesizers.<br /><br />Marilyn Manson's 'Antichrist Superstar' is an album that is both a history lesson and a self-fulfilling prophecy, as well as more than a little autobiographical. It chronicles the rise of Brian Warner from lonely, disturbed, abused and segregated boy to Marilyn Manson, the last of the Rock Stars and All-American Antichrist. This is the story of how the boy that you loved became the man that you fear.<br /><br />Antichrist Superstar was released on October 8th, 1996. It peaked at #3 on the billboard charts, earning the band arena venues for their tour to follow, respectfully entitled \\"Dead to the World.\\"<br /><br />1. Irresponsible Hate Anthem- (100/10)<br />Solid opener. One of the best on the album.<br /><br />2. Beautiful People- (10/10)<br />Even if you're not a fan of Manson, you have to have heard this song somewhere.<br /><br />3. Dried up, Tied, and Dead to the World- (8.5/10)<br />A slow song. Never could get into this one.<br /><br />4. Tourniquet- (1000/10)<br />The second best song off of Antichrist Superstar.<br /><br />5. Little Horn- (6/10)<br />Nothing too exciting here.<br /><br />6. Cryptorchid- (7/10)<br />A very good track indeed, but still not as good as Tourniquet.<br /><br />7. Deformography- (6.5/10)<br />Okay, I guess.<br /><br />8. Wormboy- (5/10)<br />Just skip this one unless you like reading into lyrics.<br /><br />9. Mister Superstar- (9.5/10)<br />Tells you not what to say when you meet your favorite celebrity. But don't listen to me, I don't know what any of these songs are trying to say. I'm just giving my opinion in them.<br /><br />10. Angel With the Scabbed Wings- (8/10)<br />Again, an okay song.<br /><br />11. Kinderfield- (8/10)<br />Look above.<br /><br />12. Antichrist Superstar- (999/100)<br />Second favorite song off of the record. Heavy track, and it sounds even heavier live.<br /><br />13. 1996- (10/10)<br />A very good track. Very good indeed.<br /><br />14. Minute of Decay- (10/10)<br />Slow and melodic, but is that a bad thing? Well, sometimes. But not here.<br /><br />15. Reflecting God- (10,000,000/100)<br />THE BEST F***ING SONG OFF OF THE RECORD! Manson's vocals are to die for on this song.

B0006284JQ|5.0|Britney Spears is nothing short of a pop phenomenom.  Though her vocal abilities are certainly in question (especially of late), she was nonetheless good and unique --something many followers lack-- enough to garner a recording deal from pop music's premier label Jive Records.  Her ubiquitous-ly enjoyable 1998 hit-video \\"...Baby One More Time\\" certainly helped pave the way for her amazing success, but it is in the songs that keep being played as frequently on radio that has kept her the iconic female superstar she is today.  Greatest Hits: My Prerogative is Britney's first greatest hits collection, her fifth studio release, and features an amazing array of stylings from the talented Miss Spears, including two never-before-heard songs that push her into a new area of pop music.  Songs from her first album showcase Spears' vocals better than anywhere else on this CD (save 2004's uber-hit self-penned single \\"Everytime\\"), proving that once a long time ago Britney did have the chops to pull off being a singing sensation (\\"Sometimes\\" features Spears, near the end of the single, belting out the word \\"sometimes\\" as clear and as beautiful as ever; a highlighting moment on this record vocally).  Her latest endeavors of the Grammy-winning \\"Toxic,\\" 2001's sensational \\"Slave 4 U\\" and new hit \\"Do Somethin'\\" definitely add a spark of differency and uniqueness to a majority of Top 40-sounding and pleasing material.  Like her or not, Britney Spears is on top on Greatest Hits: My Prerogative and proves she is a musical powerhouse in the pop market.
B00000AFGM|4.0|Inspired by the image and musical cues of Bowie, Warner reworked Marilyn Manson into a sleek, androgynous space alien named Omega, a la Ziggy Stardust, and constructed a glammy variation of his trademark goth-metal. With pal Billy Corgan as an unofficial consultant and Soundgarden producer Michael Beinhorn manning the boards, Manson turns Mechanical Animals into a big, clean rock record -- the kind that stands in direct opposition to the dark, twisted industrial nightmares he painted with his first two albums. Not my favorite album, but it comes in third place when you speak of his greatest albums.<br /><br />1. Great Big White World (7/10)- A good opener. Nuff said.<br />2. The Dope Show (10/10)- This is actually the song that got me into Manson. All the lyrics about drugs and whatnot.<br />3. Mechanical Animals (6/10)- An okay song I guess. Just too slow, though.<br />4. Rock is Dead (15/10)- This is one of the heaviest songs on the album, to tell you the truth. And one of the best.<br />5. Disassociative (20/10)- My favorite track from the entire album. Sometimes slow songs can be pretty cool, just as long as the guitars still rock your balls off and the lyrics are easy to understand.<br />6. The Speed of Pain (8/10)- I just never found out what people saw in this song. Still good enough, though.<br />7. Posthuman (7.5/10)- Eh...Just good, not great.<br />8. I Want to Disappear (6.5/10)- See above.<br />9. I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me) (12/10)- Very catchy, and the video is funny as hell.<br />10. New Model No.15 (10/10)- Very electric with some very heavy riffs. Very good song, in other words.<br />11. User Friendly (9.5/10)- An addicive song.<br />12. Fundamentaly Loathsome (5.5/10)- To me, this is the worst song on the album. Too slow and hard to get into.<br />13. The Last Day on Earth (10/10)- One of his songs with really meaningful lyrics.<br />14. Coma White (1,000,000/10)- I remember me and my ex-girlfriend used to listen to this song all the time. The song is really great and the video fits perfect with the song.<br /><br />All in all, a very good album with very few flaws. I recomend this to people who have atleast heard one or two of Manson's earlier songs and are planing on buying one of his albums. Actually, this one or the greatest hits. You decide, I suck at deciding.<br /><br />See U in the Future...ect with the song.    All in all, a very good album with very few flaws. I recomend this to people who have atleast heard one or two of Manson's earlier songs and are planing on buying one of his albums. Actually, this one or the greatest hits.

B0007GAEGC|1.0|Were they all lip syncing? You could visibly see audio not matching their mouths. Sure, live, but backstage before hand and then \\"sang\\" live to make the Strobe lights match up best. For what I heard on PBS tonight, like someone else said.. \\"overproduced\\".  Far too crafted and arranged to allow for any individuality. The women all sounded the same, all high pitched and what was with all the english? No irish accented voices like when I listen to gaelic or irish jigs.   <br />Absolutely boring boring boring. I think those who give it 5 stars probably like Michael Bolton and Kenny G and christian music or have NEVER heard the likes of Loreena McKennit or Enya and like simple safe sounds. It was not risky or emotional and in no way evoked emotion. And the canned styles of the head cocking and hand positions as well as the stage walking was all so marked and over choreographed. Trust me, skip it if you are looking for real ethnic sounding irish music... you will not find it here. I have cavities from the starch and sugargloss of celtic music they did.
B000001Y5X|5.0|STARRING:<br /><br />Daisy Berkowitz Psychoacoustical Guitars.<br /><br />Twiggy Ramirez (Gidget Gein actually plays all base guitar on the album): Base Tendencies.<br /><br />Madonna Wayne Gacy: Hammond Organ, Theremin, Saxophone, Calliopenis, Brass, Babies, Distorted Muzette, Loops.<br /><br />Sara Lee Lucas: Hitting.<br /><br />and Mr. Manson: Accusations, Child Manipulations, Backwards Masking, Polaroids.<br /><br />At this stage in their evolution, Marilyn Manson was clearly a band, not just the project of Brian Warner a.k.a. Mr. Manson, who would later simply adopt his band's name as his own. Also, horror-show schlock was a bigger factor than it would be later on, when he wanted to be the Antichrist Superstar for the world at large. In other words, it's Manson at his silliest, singing about \\"My Monkey\\" and \\"Snake Eyes and Sissies.\\"<br /><br />Beneath all the camp shock, there are signs of Warner's unerring eye for genuine outrage and musical talent, particularly on the trio of \\"Cake and Sodomy,\\" \\"Lunch Box\\" and \\"Dope Hat.\\" But even a few years on from its 1994 release, Portrait of an American Family has begun to sound a little dated, especially since its Nine Inch Nails-meets-WASP-meets-Alice Cooper formula was fully realized on Manson's follow-up album, Antichrist Superstar. Here, it's in sketch form, and by the end of the album it's clear that Warner, Manson, whatever you want to call him, needs a full canvas to truly wreak havoc.<br /><br />See U in the Future...
B00005LMBK|5.0|...in his side-project Gorillaz.  In addition to being the driving force behind Blur, one of the best bands in the last 20 years, PERIOD, Damon gets his chance to unleash his experimental side on the music-buying public in the formation of the virtual band Gorillaz.  The album is really a collaboration between Damon, Dan the Automator, and Del tha Funky Homosapien.  And what a collaboration it is.  The best songs (Tomorrow Comes Today, Clint Eastwood, Double Bass, 19-2000, Starshine) mix Damon's melodic genius and inventiveness with some awesome beats and great raps.  And the final track, Left Hand Suzuki Method, hilariously mixes broken English from Japanese students of the famous violin-learning method with a brutal backbeat.  The whole album is a ton of fun...get it!
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I have seen this movie more times than I would like to admit. It is awsome in the theatre, but also very good on the small screen. The music seems to \\"stick in your head\\". The voices couldn't be better and Gerard Butler is mesmorizing in his part. Even if you have seen the play, you must see the movie.
B00082IJ08|5.0|...but still just as good.  This time Damon Albarn has teamed up with DJ Danger Mouse for the sequel to the first Gorillaz album, and the results are another great album.  Feel Good Inc. is an absolutely brilliant track, easily the best on the album and features a killer rap from De La Soul.  Dirty Harry, as any Blur fan will realize, contains musical ideas from Damon's solo-demo record DemoCrazy, from a couple of years back.  Kids With guns is a great song, as are Dare (featuring Shaun Ryder) and Last Living Souls.  Every Planet We Reach Is Dead is another winner, and the Dennis Hopper-read Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head is a riot.  The final two tracks segue together into a sort of majestic endpiece.  Great record.
B0000009NH|5.0|Hunky Dory (1971.), David Bowie's fourth studio album<br /><br />David Bowie is arguably one of the greatest solo artists of all time and his unique alternative style (notice the omission of the word 'pop') is timeless and has deservedly won him loads of fans from generation to generation. Bowie has changed his style from album to album and has produced music in loads of different styles whilst still maintaining his distinctive sound. 'Hunky Dory', Bowie's fourth studio album, released in 1971 is one of the greatest chapters in his career and is definitely one of his most powerful releases.<br /><br />'Hunky Dory' is the second album in what I would describe as Bowie's classic run of five albums from 'Man Who Sold the World' to 'Diamond Dogs' when he was at his very best. 'Hunky Dory' though is one of his most unique releases. Bowie was not yet into his famous Ziggy Stardust glam rock period but neither is this album as strongly guitar based as its predecessor 'Man Who Sold the World'. 'Hunky Dory' instead is much more acoustic based with lots of piano thrown in but most of all is an album of unbelievable songwriting - songs don't come much better than those on this album. The album is really well structured as well - each side of the original LP has happy/upbeat songs for the most part but finishes off with a darker, emotive and more powerful song ('Quicksand' and 'Bewlay Brothers'). Bowie's backing group are also excellent on this album. Rick Wakeman's jazzy piano playing is there practically throughout and really characterises the album. Mick Ronson plays some great guitar solos on the album especially in 'Life on Mars'. Bowie's accomplished and often overlooked saxophone playing is also top notch on this album.<br /><br />David Bowie's album collection has undergone a number of remasters since CD's became commonplace about 20 years ago. Recently an enhanced CD version of 'Hunky Dory' was released. Obviously the sound quality is great but the version lacks any bonus tracks, which incidentally can be found on the 1991 remaster. The latter is the version I would recommend. It still has excellent sound quality and also has demo versions of 'Quicksand' and 'Bewlay Brothers' as well as an album outtake 'Bombers' and an alternative version of 'The Supermen' from 'The Man Who Sold the World' album.<br /><br />Eventhough this masterpiece yielded a fair-share of singles, this album is not pop in my opinion but instead is a great serving of alternative, extremely listenable music. 'Changes', one of Bowie's well known songs starts the album. An excellent song, its got a classic chorus with loads of piano play. 'oh You Pretty Things' is a great follow up - brilliant for a sing along with another catchy chorus. It runs very cleverly into 'Eight Line Poem' which is a more reflective songs with somem rather bluesy guitar playing from Mick Ronson. 'Life On Mars?' is next up and this one truly one of Bowie's great songs. The lyrics are some of the best I've heard and Mick Ronson's closing solo is out of this world - listen out for the phone ringing at the end of the track! 'Kooks' is an upbeat acoustic track which Bowie wrote for his son, Zowy Bowie. Then we come to 'Quicksand', in my opinion the best track on the album. Its got an amazingly calming start before building into a powerful, heartfelt song - the chorus is really moving. A song about losing direction in life, this is one of Bowie's greatest songs.<br /><br />What was side two of the LP kicks off with a happy sing along 'Fill Your Heart', a great track, although it is the weakest track on this great album - ironically Bowie didn't write this one! 'Andy Warhol' follows this; this strong acoustic jam is excellent. The goofing around in the studio at the start is a hillarious, where Bowie keeps correcting the sound engineer's pronunciation of 'Warhol'. 'Song For Bob Dylan' is a tribute to one of Bowie's great influences and is followed by 'Queen Bitch', the most rocking track on thealbum, Ronson's guitar work on this track is first rate. 'The Bewlay Brothers' is an unbelievably potent finish to the album. I'm amazed how many reviewers of this album overlook the greatness of this track. I've never heard a track like it. It's mostly acoustic based and is Bowie's telling story of his own brother's lifelong mental troubles. The warped sounding voice at the end of the album is really freaky and it makes your blood run cold but its a remarkable finish to an amazing album.<br /><br />The 'Hunky Dory' album captures David Bowie on one of the high points of his career. I'm not sure if I'd call it his best album but its up there with his finest efforts and this album is sure to stand the test of time. I'd recommend this album to anyone who likes a unique alternative style of music or to any fan of David Bowie, although there isn't such such a thing as a Bowie fan who doesn't own this masterpiece!ck is first rate.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|Having seen the stage show in Toronto several times, I found myself hoping a film would be made that managed to capture the romance, excitement and drama of that excellent production.  It was, therefore, with great anticipation that I watched this movie for the first time.  To my delight, it met and even surpassed my highest expectations.  The casting was inspired, and the producers managed to make the transition from theatre to big screen flawlessly, adding just minor embellishments that only enhanced the story.<br />I suppose some might say that the voice of Gerard Butler as the Phantom may not be quite as polished as those before him, but it has a raw, sensual edge to it that exudes all the passion and longing of that tortured soul.  I enjoyed it so much, in fact, that I am adding the soundtrack to the Toronto cast recording CD that is already in my collection.<br />As I watched the DVD, excitement began to course through me, and I realized that half way through I was feeling the same emotions that I had in Toronto, once again thinking \\"I can hardly wait to come back.\\"  Indeed, I have come back many times since, and if I don't eventually wear out the DVD it won't be for trying.<br />I LOVE this movie!
B00005V9HH|1.0|Okay, so I heard about how great this movie is. \\"It's funny, it's great, it's a classic,\\" they all said. So I rented the movie and watched it. Now I just have three words: WTF??? <br /> <br />I didn't get this movie. Was it supposed to be fun? Exciting? Thrilling? A mystery? What is it? At the end, I just didn't care. <br /> <br />Let's start with the characters. They are not very likeable at all to me. None of them are. They just like to cuss and yell all the time. Wow. I am amazed by the acting ability. The characters are just plain not very likeable, so when they all die I can't say I really care. <br /> <br />The story was dumb. Or, let me rephrase that. It's not that the story was dumb. The story was very complex. It's just that, who cares? A bunch of guys who we don't like get involved in some deal with some other guy who we don't like, and one survivor who we don't like gets interrogated by a \\"tough\\" cop who we don't like. Only at the end do we find out that the one ending that we thought we understood but didn't like is replaced by another ending a bit more convoluted but no more likeable. So what's to like?  <br /> <br />The movie repeatedly makes a big deal about the lack of drugs on the boat. It has to make the point over and over, like it is something really vital for the audience to know. \\"Ohmygosh there is no coke!\\" or \\"Golly gee, it wasn't a drug deal!\\". Okay, scriptwriter. We get it already! And now that we know, who cares? <br /> <br />So the \\"Big Mystery\\" was that it was a hit rather than a drug deal. Wow. Really. Amazing. And we are supposed to care for WHAT reason? <br /> <br />And Humor? What humor? I've seen several people talk about how hilarious this movie is. When did that happen? I think I was awake the whole movie, and I didn't even take any bathroom breaks. This was supposed to be FUNNY? Where? When? How?   <br /> <br />And what about the show's tagline? \\"Who is Kieser Soze?\\" How about this response: \\"Who cares?\\" I had absolutely no interest whatsoever in who Kieser Soze was the entire movie, and it wasn't until the movie was over that I finally realized that apparently I was supposed to have been concerned about this. I was supposed to have been thinking about who might be Kieser Soze the entire movie. Only I didn't. I guess the writing was just too sophisticated for a dense guy like me. <br /> <br />So it is a mystery then? Who is Kieser Soze? Okay, so let it be a mystery. Except, this movie ruins that for an audience too. Instead of letting there be any mystery, they rush at the end to explain the entire movie to you and let you know EXACTLY who the guy is. What mystery? What is there to discuss any further about this movie? And why would anybody ever want to watch it again?  <br /> <br />This was a waste of time and waste of money. I can't believe this has an Amazon rating of 4-1/2 stars, for crying out loud! What are you people smoking??? <br /> <br />If anybody wants to see a GOOD crime movie, with characters we can actually feel for and care about plus a complex and intriguing story, try watching THE GODFATHER again. Now THAT is what good moviemaking is all about. <br /> <br />So are you pissed off yet? Leave me a \\"No, this review was not helpful\\" rating if you want to folks, but I just didn't get this movie. Highly Unrecommended. <br />

0743454537|5.0|In My Sister's Keeper, which was every bit as good as I thought it would be, Anna Fitzgerald is tired of it all. Her sister Katie, who has been sickly her entire life has had to have one procedure after another. But she wouldn't have been able to stay alive as long as she did without Anna's help, her younger sister who was conceived for that very reason. Since Jesse was no match for Kate in any way for blood or bone marrow, Sara and Brian, the parents created their special plan to genetically plan Anna. That way, conceived inside a petri dish, she could be Katie's match, and not once, but many times over. <br /> <br />Anna feels she is nothing but a guinea pig for Katie, and is very weary of the whole situation. Especially when Katie will experience renal failure finally, and needs a kidney transplant from her sister of course. But here is where Anna draws the line. Seeking out a lawyer, she sues her parents for rights to make up her own mind on her medical care. This causes a lot of tension within the whole family through this whole book. Campbell, the lawyer, and Julia, her guardian ad litem, try to help all they can. As time goes on, Katie will fail more and more, and Sara, Anna's mom, keeps pressuring Anna to change her mind. But on the other hand, poor Katie just wants to let go. <br /> <br />They battle on through court, and what's in the end, well, I won't tell of course. But it is very sad indeed. Jesse, the older boy, is the runt of the litter, more or less and feels left out in his family as his parents concentration is solely on Anna and Kate. He gets on drugs and things like that, but in the end, he comes around to his own and straightens out.  <br /> <br />Each chapter in the book focuses on one of these characters I've mentioned and is very easy to follow. It is one of those books which you never forget reading.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't own a television.  I never even HEARD of firefly until about 3 or 4 weeks ago.  I got the first disk on netflix and I couldn't believe the quality.  This isn't like any TV show I've ever seen (if TV was usually like this, I'd own a television).  I bought the DVD boxed set and I've watched every episode multiple times and I can't wait until September 30 when the MOVIE (Serenity) comes out.    (Yes, they are making a movie.  Traditionally, this does not happen with failed TV shows, but Firefly is special).
0786246448|5.0|Anthony Burgess' novel A Clockwork Orange has become a sort of underground classic. It is read and loved by young men all over the world.  The novel is written in a language all its own; a hybrid of English and Russian slang. Burgess called this language Nadsat. It can be, at first, difficult. However, once the reader acclimates themself to the rythyms of the words Nadsat comes alive. The language of this novel is electric. Burgess was very interested in music, and was a composer. In this novel he uses words as Mozart would have used musical notes.  A Clockwork Orange is the story of Alex, a young criminal. He and his \\"droogs\\" (friends) roam the streets robbing, beating, and raping the people they encounter. Alex is quite satisfied with his life, he has everything he needs.  Things begin to turn bad for Alex after a midnight raid on a house in the country. He is captured by the police and his friends turn on him. Soon Alex finds himself in prison, where he is offered the \\"Ludovico treatment\\". This treatment will garuntee that he never breaks another law.   Alex agrees to the treatment in exchange for release from prison. This is the point in the story where Burgess' talent really begins to show. It is at this point that the reader fully realizes that Burgess is not simply telling a story; he is showing us a metaphor for the world we inhabit.  The Ludovico treatment turns Alex into a clockwork orange: he appears to be a living creature, but is merely a machine. Alex, stripped of free will is unable to defend himself. And, because he cannot choose evil, any good he may do is meaningless.  In this book Burgess first creates a loathsome character. Then draws us into his world, making us care a bit about what happens to him. He then tears down that characters world, to show how easily our world can be torn down.  This is a startling, and brilliant book. It is not for the squeamish, nor the easily offended.  By the way, if you purchase this book be sure to look for the European edition which is one chapter longer than the American version.   ----------------
B00009W0WM|5.0|This movie is probably the greatest film achivement ever created by man,  and the romance between Bogart and Bergman will NEVER be matched.  A film this great can never be missed by anybody, and it is a truly powerful, moving, and beautiful film and it still remains so. There is not a false note in acting, story or characterization. This film won richly deserved Oscars for Best Picture, Director and Screenplay (but why didn' t Humphrey Bogart win Best Actor?)  <br /> <br />The DVD is enormous. It is one of the greatest multi-disc sets ever released.  Disc One contains the film in its correct 1.33:1 aspect ratio (that is fullscreen, and yes, widescreen is better, but this film was filmed in fullscreen and there was no such thing as widescreen at the time!)  And Disc Two contains a huge amount of features. <br /> <br />Film: 10/10 <br />DVD: 10/10 <br /> <br />BUY THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL LOVE IT.
0553802534|4.0|I really liked the book, but this is the first time where I have read a book and liked it but hated all the main characters. I am wondering if that was Ms. Gardners intentions? Each character comes with a problem(s) and the author writes the suspense/mystery around the whole group. Very well done. The story builds over time so you must stick with it till the end. If you are a fan of Ms. Gardner you will be very happy you did.
B000005H7D|5.0|Jazz at it's finest. You can't get much better than this. Trane is quite strong in this album, being his first solo album ever. The band locks in very smoothly, abd very soon begans to form onr entity. Trane blows his lines so fluently its almost un-real. Curtis Fuller, a very good Bone player, is not quite up to the challenge of playing with firey substance of Trane and Morgan. He makes a few mistakes such as landing on a minor 5th in \\"Blue trane\\", but they're very few, in fact I can only recall 2-3. Mainly those with a trianed ear will hear it, but most won't. Fuller does in deed hold his own, he may be the weakest link in this album, but he is NOT a weak player. All in all, very good album, highly recommended for anyone who wants to get into Coltrane or Jazz period. Great study piece for up and comming musicians.
B000683VI4|3.0|I just watched The Notebook. My date loved it (her third time to see it). I thought it was pretty good. Fairly predictable and a bit sappy. I had the ending guessed less than half way through. <br /> <br />Not so terrible that I wish I had those two hours of my life back, but I don't think I'll be watching it a second time.
B000002I53|5.0|What can I say. This a beautiful album. \\"My favorite things\\" is a masterpiece alone. For about 14min Trane and his quartet are in a trance. I can literally meditate to this song. A stroke of genious to add the \\"middle eastern\\" feel to the song. (Figures since at the time Tranes was heavily into studying Islamic religions) It is so wonderfully simple too, but entirely complex. You can't really take it all in on first listen. And Trane on Soprano saxophone is a true joy. The soprano saxophone is such a difficult instrument to play as far as tonality and pitch. And useually you get such a nasally  tone from it, like Kenny G's playing. But Trane soprano tone is wonderful, like an ear durm massage. Mccoy Tyner's solo in \\"MFT\\" is also wonderful. Many times you hear Mccoy leaning towards the edge in his playing, but here, it's simple, elagant, angellic almost. Superb. But actually my favorite song on the album is \\"But not for me\\". I've heard and played this song so many times, but when I heard Tranes rendition, I didn't recognze it, until I listened to it a few times and relized he'd taken the chord changes and fit them over his famous (or infamous if your jazz student) Coltrane changes. These are the same changes used in the song \\"Giant Steps\\". Hearing that made laugh at how crazy it was. Unbelieveble. For anyone who want to get into Jazz, this is a great album to start with.
B0000508U6|5.0|Sometimes I wish Coldplay wasn't as popular as they are now. The main reason for that being that amount of \\"OMFG!!!!!111This is the worst band EVER!!!\\" reviews that pollute the album overview pages. Another, closely related reason being that according to the indie guidebook(*coughs*Pitchforkmedia*coughs*), a band which reaches such a status as Coldplay enjoy now, must be immediately derided and snubbed, notwithstanding the quality of their music. <br /> <br />Now on to business. I am a Coldplay fan ever since the piano-led intro of Trouble made it's way into my bedroom on a cold weekday morning, corrupted by white noise from the ether. One cannot stress enough the importance of this album to those who grew up at the time it was released. In 2000, the music world had reached a deep slump. The Britpop era was over, and although Radiohead had released Kid A, they did not carry any meaning for a 13-year-old. Pop trash filled the airwaves, an old clich, but still true. Then Coldplay appeared on the scene. Their sober, somber stylings and their honest and heartfelt lyrics were quite a change from their overproduced peers. They were a simple band writing simple songs about love gained and lost. They did not rock out. They might've even been 'bedwetters'. It mattered not.    What did matter was that Coldplay had a sincerity to them that most other bands don't have, and their music resonated within not just a few of us. There is no objective way to view this. Why should, after all, such a band that does not innovate, that sings about such subjects that would've sounded mundane in the mouth of any other frontman, gain such a huge following? They did not have the image to support them either. Or maybe they did: both in words and in appearance, Chris Martin seemed like so ordinary. But even that does not seem to be an adequate clarification. After all, bands like Travis had a similar college-student fashion sensibilities. They too, were part of the spate of post-Radiohead 'sensitive' bands. By the way, those who STILL insist that Coldplay DO sound like Radiohead are severly deluding themselves. I've always maintained that Coldplay had much more in common musically with the Beatles and U2, and their latest record is more evidence to that. Coming back to the old point, I've never really liked Travis, the Doves or any of Coldplay's other counterparts much. So how DO Coldplay manage to stand out and not get sucked into the quagmire? Gwyneth Paltrow surely could have hardly been enough. <br /> <br />There is no real answer to that question, save that Coldplay somehow seem to have that automatic intuition that so many other artists lack. There is never an instrument or a chord that sounds out of place. All their songs have a vaguely familiar feel. This usually means, like in the case of Oasis, that the melody lines or some of the lyrics have been nicked from some other artist. Not so with Coldplay. Their success doesn't remove anything from  the fact that this is certainly a top-class album. It is gentle and warm, and yet musically interesting enough to remain in any collection for a lifetime. Their follow-up is only even better. I have only listened to their latest release X&Y once, but if it is any worse than it's predecessors, that can be hardly blamed on the band, as any other artists would have buckled under the enormous pressure far earlier. And if Coldplay do break up soon after their 3rd album, perhaps we can hope that they will be judged more fairly than they have been until now.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I was a little skepticle of what I would hear when I checked this out of the library, because there are alot of metal bands that sound the same, as there are 1,000,000 identical alternative/emo bands out right now.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear the music on this CD.  It was pretty obvious that the melody-heavy songs were the best, and the screaming ones were still good, but the soft/slow songs that Slipknot does are just captivating.  They all provide a good contrast and keep the songs fresh and new as you listen to this through.  You won't be bored.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Even though Christine's voice lacked some of the fullness I was expecting in the beginning, I was very impressed with her portreyal.  The effects were beautiful as well as the costumes were stunning.
0765309408|5.0|The book was amazing, I picked it up after reading about it on several blogs and decided why not give it a try. Now I am hooked, John Scalzi can write a novel. I ended up ordering Agent to the Stars, and I can't wait until the sequel to Old Man's War comes out. If you like SciFi and want something enjoyable to read, then this really is worth it. Scalzi's usage of possible future technology taken to a next level of implementation gives the book a sense of realism, but then also scares you about the future. Fascinating book.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|Of the hundreds of records that I possess, this is one of the most treasured in my collection.  Many people have called this record deliberately too commercial, or undeniably too sensitive.  Can anyone just accept that the reason it might be so commercially successful is that people like the ones making those comments went out to the store, bought the record, listened to it for what it was, and couldn't stop?  Well it could be the truth. <br /> <br />     As for being too sensitive, what's wrong with people? Emotions are supposed to be the driving force behind a song's inspiration.  Few things that I have ever heard are more beautiful than Dave's voice on \\"The Colour and The Shape\\".  The sweet serenity of the songs lull listeners in to stories filled with memories and heartbreaks.  Hence, all that is a relationship. <br /> <br />     Soft songs sometimes speak volumes more than loud hard-driving rock anthems.  If you can go through \\"The Colour and The Shape\\" and not relate to anything, you need to experience more in relationships.  Every song has meaning, and is there for a point on this record.  For the first time (aside from Big Me and For the Cows on the self-titled album, and Marigold with Nirvana), Dave Grohl's songwriting capability escapes.  He perfects the pop ballad. <br /> <br />     Forget the singles, although they are good songs, they should not be singled out, for the whole album's quality is superior.  One of the best aspects is its balance, as it transitions from loud to soft back and forth.  It is nearly flawless in my (an experienced musician's) opinion, and one of the best records ever produced.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|The two words that title this movie can also outline the greatness of this film, but it would take a long review to express the complete excellence of it. I first saw this movie in a small theater, and was thoroughly captivated by it.<br /><br />The movie starts out with the 28-gun HMS Surprise, Captain \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey (a spectacular Russell Crowe) commanding, sailing somewhere off the coast of northern Brazil. Jack has orders to intercept the French privateer Acheron and \\"Sink, Burn, or take her a Prize,\\" as the French ship is trying to take the Napoleonic wars into Pacific waters.<br /><br />Close to the beginning of the film, the Acheron comes into view in heavy fog. It rakes the Surprise with heavy cannonfire numerous times, giving ship surgeon and captain's friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (an excellent Paul Bettany) numerous casualties to operate on. Jack returns fire but cannot even penetrate the ship's hull at 200 yards with the Surprise's smaller guns.<br /><br />After escaping from the enemy by using the dense fog to their advantage, the Surprise is later found again by the French and pursued at length by the Acheron. \\"Lucky\\" Jack can think of no way to beat the 44-gun ship in open water until an up-close look at an intricate piece of nature, provided by his friend the doctor, gives him a brilliant idea.<br /><br />With his ship well-disguised, Jack springs his trap in extremely close quarters with the Acheron. He unleashes a broadside and sweeping musket fire on the French privateer before leading his men over the side to board it. The battle that follows is full of suspense, great swordfighting, very well-done and realistic musketry, and other perfectly historically accurate items.<br /><br />The entire movie is very historically accurate, and the immense attention to every little intricate piece of life (and death) aboard a British ship is accurate to the extreme. The period weaponry is fantastic, and the battles are very realistic and well-done. The scenes of the ships sailing in calm, storm, and battle are absolutely convincing, showing what a great job the crew did in utilizing a 20th century replica of a real British ship (the HMS Rose) along with exact replica sets, miniatures, and computer designs.<br /><br />All of the roles (and the entire ship's crew) were cast with the utmost care, with not one bit of bad acting done. Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy, and each and every one of the others did an excellent job in his place in the ranks of the Surprise's men. I can think of no one better for the role of captain than Crowe, who did a job that in my opinion should have won him an Oscar for best leading actor.<br /><br />The soundtrack of the film is another distinguishing facet of this movie, making excellent use of percussion and stringed instruments for superb music in any of the film's diverse environments and situations.<br /><br />The documentaries included in the special features of this Collector's Edition are very interesting and informative, showing how the entire cast and crew pulled off such a great film that has already become a classic.<br /><br />All around, this movie is an excellent piece of film-making and not the least bit boring as some say. The intense battles, realistic sailing scenes, perfect historical accuracy, great characters, captivating story, and more make this the must-have film that is sure to become the master and commander of your DVD collection.ne.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I liked this CD a lot, put I still prefer Toxicity and Steal this Album. the music is good but I don't quite like the idea of Daron singing, specially after listening to Serj (he has a very powerful voice and is capable of reaching very high or low tones, while Daron's voice is kind of squeaky) I'm going to check the songs one by one.<br /><br />1. Soldier Side-Intro 8/10 .- It's a good intro, nothing special about it.<br /><br />2. B.Y.O.B. 10/10 .- great song and music, more like SOAD style<br /><br />3. Revenga 9/10 .- good music and I like fast singing, but not for a 10<br /><br />4. Cigaro 10/10 .- I like this one a lot, its kinda funny. one of the best of the album.<br /><br />5. Radio/Video 8/10 .- This songs lacks of lyrics, it says the same over and over, but it has good music and it makes me laugh a lot<br /><br />6. This Cocaine Makes me Feel Like I'm on This Song 7/10 .- very fast and quite short song. not very good lyrics and nothing special about the music either<br /><br />7. Violent Pornography 8/10 .- It doesn't say much, but it's ok, basically for just jumping.<br /><br />8. Question! 10/10 .- This is the song I like the most. the music and singing is more controlled and more serious, and the lyrics are good too<br /><br />9. Sad Statue 10/10 .- Second best! like the one before, this is also serious speaking of lyrics (I like the chorus a lot) and it has very good music as well<br /><br />10. Old School Hollywood 8/10 .- The last two songs are more calmed than the rest of the album (except for the intro). This song is more like techno (robot voice and all) but has nothing special<br /><br />11. Lost in Hollywood 8/10 .- this is the slowest one, the lyrics are ok and the music is good, but it would have been a lot better if Serj had done the singing, instead, he only does the backgounds while Daron sings. Now, he doesn't sing that bad, but they should leave the vocals to the vocalist. still it's a good way to end the album
B00000JIL1|5.0|Rory's best solo disc and best production after several muddy sounding discs.<br /><br />Brilliant guitar work from the master of blues rock.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Somehow I didn't get it with Origin of Symmetry. And Showbiz is only OK in my book. But Absolution has grabbed hold of me and won't let go. The combination of soaring, powerful vocals over driving new rock is incredibly compelling.<br /><br />Vis the Radiohead comparison.... Yep. Love Radiohead, love this CD. You don't have to choose, they are both amazingly talented, intelligent bands.<br /><br />If you are an old art rock/prog rock fan, you may find that you really enjoy this CD. There are clear Queen and ELO references, but it is ultimately much more hard core than most art rock bands ever were.<br /><br />Powerful, compelling, emotional. Must buy CD.
B000002L68|5.0|'Dig if you will the picture of you and I engaged in a kiss'    One of my favourite songs is 'When Doves Cry'. What I love about the lyric is that it is simple and you know exactly what he is talking/singing about. It's like he's saying 'I really fancy you but I'm not going to show myself up. I'm not going to chase you or anything!'     It's the classic case of somebody being torn by the dilema of not wanting to look too keen but at the same time they are still flirting like mad.     Let's face it, we've all been there!
0553802534|5.0|This is a great book by Lisa Gardner. Probably her best so far.  It is written in such a way that the reader is kept guessing as to what is actually happening.  Great characters in Bobby Dodge and Catherine Gagnon, Catherine being the more complex of the two.  It's hard to know what to feel about her. Sympathy? Dislike? In the end, maybe a bit of both.  It would nice to see Bobby continue on in another book.  I think there's more about him to be explored.  A very enjoyable mystery. <br /> <br />
B0002XDODU|5.0|This album is so good, I got my wife to like it! This is definite one of those albums that once picked upped, even accidentally, will make you a believer. BUY THIS NOW! BUY THIS NOW! BUY THIS NOW! BUY THIS NOW! BUY THIS NOW! lol. =)
B000001FA4|5.0|This is probably my third or fourth favorite U2 album behind what I believe is the greatest rock album ever, The Joshua Tree, and a top ten all timer in Achtung Baby.  Let's put it this way, I could not listen to this album for weeks and then put it on and then be seamlessly tranported to a place that seems so familiar, and yet scary.  The production on this album, due largely due the innovation of Eno and Lanois, and the genius of the band itself, really sends any listener on a sweeping journey through a haunting and vivid soundscape with its many musical layers that only Edge, Larry, and Adam can deliver.   It dark, but yet spiritual.  It IS the perfect bridge between the angst of WAR and the spirituality of JT.  My favorite songs are Sort of HomeComing and Bad.  Though Unforgettable Fire and Promenade have a special affect on me that I cannot explain...sort of analagous to Say Goodbye and No. 41 on Dave Matthews Band's Crash (1996)...can't explain it but they do.  This album trully exposes one of the shortcomings of U2's more recent efforts ATYCLB and HTDAAB, the lack of keyboards and multiple layers of guitar and keyboard integration.  I have to try another reviewers suggestion and play MLK and Streets from JT back to back to get the full effect and beauty of MLK, which is one of the most beautiful songs U2 has ever performed live...think back to Bono's silhouette against a fire red Arizona sky at Sun Devil stadium.  Let me close by saying BAD is my favorite U2 song next to Streets...true anthems and samples of U2's grandiose presence.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Eleven years after \\"Hell Freezes over\\", the Eagles deliver a better live set. All the guys are there, Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Joe Walsh, Schmit, and Felder. All are in fine vocal form especially Joe Walsh whose voice has not aged a bit. With a 2-disc set, there are more songs and additional new ones. There are a total of twenty-nine (29) songs! It also includes the heart-rending \\"Hole In The World\\". Gone is the personal stiffness that seemed to overshadow \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" and each group member shares the spotlight with their own special song(s) and interplay. There is no shortness of levity or professionalism. The larger setting and the lightshow also is a huge improvement. Why this wasn't recorded in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound is a mystery, but it still sounds (and looks) great. It's just a peaceful, easy-feeling, good concert.
B00005RY7X|3.0|PARTY HARD is by far the greatest song on this album, a great headbanger! However, many of the tracks on here sound very similar. 1 and 2 are practically the same song! If you listen to the samples, you'll know exactly what I mean. But Andrew W.K is cool nevertheless. The front cover would suit a band like Pig destroyer more though! <br /> <br />Decent punk music!
B00097A5I6|1.0|I cant believe some the reviews here. While it's true that several reviewers called this record for what it really is (a blatant 60s rip-off) others are writting stuff that borders psychedelia. I cant believe that \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" is being seriously compared to the first 2 Oasis LPs. Simply beyond me. Those are the only Oasis albums where the band actually expressed their own creativity, showed convincingly their own input, and didnt consume themselves in simply ruminating stuff others did better in the past. <br /> <br />   Nor is it easy to understand that people dont spot how obvious it is what Oasis have done in this record, which is: not much. Sure, it's an age thing, as anyone over 35 will easily hear that there's zero effort in this album to sound original even by Oasis standards. Obviously someone would have to be either too young or a hardcore die-hard fanatic in order to miss this. <br /> <br />   The essence in all this remains the same as it has been ever since the release of \\"What's the story morning glory\\": if you have the 2 first albums of this group you're more than covered. Anything released by them after that is pointless completely, unless you prefer to hear badly executed disguised cover versions and not the original thing. Matter of choice i guess. <br /> <br />   With Oasis, even though the talent is obviously there, the will and the intention is not. That's a pretty sad realisation if only because of its implications. What implications are these? Well, we live in capitalism, so maybe you can figure it out on your own. <br /> <br />   One of the most forgettable and cynical albums in the \\"rock and pop\\" scene that i could remember of.
0316168815|5.0|Kudos to Alice Sebold. I read this book after seeing it mentioned at a grief website and found myself deeply touched by the Sebold's keen insight into the emotions surrounding survivors of tragic deaths.  <br /> <br />It's been almost two years since my sister died in an auto accident, and while I've moved along in the grieving process, this book was very cathartic for me on many levels (and led to many tears as well as smiles). I could see so many parallels in what happened to Susie Salmon's family following her death to my own family's reaction to our loss, as well as the unexpected consequences on friends and even acquaintances of the deceased.  <br /> <br />So, if you're grieving an unexpected loss, you likely will find yourself glad you read Sebold's debut novel. A note for survivors of sibling loss, she gets it.

0802130208|5.0|Dunces is probably one of the best books you may get a chance to read.  Everything about the novel: characters, plot, and language flows so nicely together that I don't think I've ever come across a book so easy to read but yet doesn't pull its intellectual punch.   <br /> <br />I found myself at certain points wondering what the book was really about but could never put it down.
1400043662|2.0|I do enjoy Haruki Murakami. I am one who responded particularly well to \\"Dance! Dance! Dance!,\\" \\"Wind-up Bird,\\" and \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland.\\" I also never saw the appeal of \\"Norwegian Wood\\" nor \\"The Wild Sheep Chase.\\" If you enjoyed either of those books, you might want to take my review with a grain of salt. If your tastes run in my same direction, then you might not even want to give this one a read (though an author's \\"failures\\" can bring us much insight into his work--if you truly love Murakami, you might enjoy the activity of asking yourself, why didn't this one work?) <br /> <br />Here were the good points of the novel: 1. a strong beginning, 2. sympathetic characters, 3. an eerie atmosphere on occasion constructed.  <br /> <br />However, I felt this novel suffered severely from the lack of an uncanny energy that practically drives most of Murakami's works. Our author is remarkable at producing a strange and powerful sensation in the reader that everything that is happening is meant to happen, links up into some coherent whole, and is also eerily familiar. He does this in part through an everyman protagonist who is forced to undergo the bizarreness of supernatural events that resonate with a psychological reality. He clearly understands how to create an atmosphere of mystery and tension in many of his other novels: he rides the line beautifully between realistic and mundane descriptions and events, and the occasional moment of a breakthrough into another world--the other side. It happens when we least expect it, like self-insight. <br /> <br />In \\"Kafka\\", the characters are too certain about where they are going and what they are doing. The reader is alienated from them. They handle too perfectly the wierdness of the situation that surrounds them. Murakami sacrifices the uncanny and any real tension in order to produce characters who are \\"in control\\" (as another reviewer puts it). But what is so powerful about Murakami's writing is that he recognizes (usually)how nothing is truly within our power.  <br /> <br />Also, he does not ride the balance all that well between normalcy (even mundanity) and the fantastic. He leaps into the fantastic without giving us sufficient build-up (except for the first several chapters, which are nice) or sufficient time to reflect upon what has occured.  <br /> <br />And can anyone tell me what's with the gratuitous prostitute? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
159413023X|5.0|I picked up a copy of this book because a lot of people said it was a good read. When I first started it I didn't want to finish it. I thought the whole concept of it being told from heaven was kind of odd and the start of the book made me cry. I pushed on though and soon I couldn't put the book down, I read it in 2 days. It made me look at things in a whole new light and I would suggest this book to anyone!
B00003CXGG|2.0|Yet another Shakespeare adaptation...but with an epic appeal-to-the-mass-audience cop out.  Romeo must kiss Juliet.  Oh no, interracial sexuality...too risky.  A truly disappointing strategic decision on the part of the producers.
0671027344|4.0|The best characteristic of Stephan Chbosky's book, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, is that it captures the struggles of adolescence. The main character, Charlie, is a freshman in high school. In the book, he doesn't appear to be popular or an outcast. Charlie symbolizes a wallflower: He's does not participate in any activities at any social events because of his shyness and unpopularity. Stephen Chbosky's writing style is genius. The book is nothing but a collection of letters to a person of no identity, address, etc. He faces many struggles that teens come in contact with: popularity status, crushes, family problems, dating, sex, and drugs. He also deals with the death of his best friend and best aunt.  <br />Charlie's letters expresses his feelings and daily activities. It seems like a diary except for the fact that it isn't private or exclusive. Instead he insisted on another person reading or receiving them. Because of his intelligence, one of his teachers and the friends he's now made tries to push him out his wallflower qualities.  <br /> Charlie suffers from depression. When his aunt Helen he was torn to pieces. He realizes a tragic thing about his aunt and pushes himself into fantasy world of no problems. I relate to Charlie. I've been through similar situations and problems. I am also in high school dealing with my peer's problems as well as mine. <br /> This books strength is its constant dramatic scenes. The books conflicts are numerous from child molestation to suicidal attempts. The action keeps your eyes glued to the pages of The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Unfortunately, this is the first book that I've read like this. It was certainly worth reading. It doesn't remind me of any other book that I've written. I would rate this book four stars. I would advise all teenagers to read this book; they would love it. Its difficulty level is 5. <br />
B000065U1N|5.0|i normally don't watch war movies, i only rented it because i  <br />heard hugh dancy was in it so i decided to watch it and i'm glad <br />i did because it was the best movie i ever saw. at first i thought it was going to be another war movie( or should i say guy movie) but i was so wrong. this movie was very moving, i was 16 when this war happened and i had forgotten about what happened there so i'm glad this movie was made because people need to know what happened and they need to remember the men who <br />died there because they were brave men and they should be remembered as such.
B000002UB3|5.0|It's difficult to express in words how much feeling I get out of listening to this album.  From the great individual tracks of the A side, every one of them a winner, to the brilliant building production and climax of the B side that still sends chills up my spine after all these years.  This is the best work by the best band to ever grace a music studio, and will be remembered as one of the greatest musical gifts the 20th century ever produced.

0316172324|5.0|Everyday, we make a seemingly infinite amount of choices, conscious or unconscious, which have direct implications on our present and future well-being. The ability to make effective snap judgments, however, is not a gift that is bestowed upon all in equal shares.    In \\"blink,\\" Malcolm Gladwell illustrates the decision-making process behind this phenomenon, explaining how human beings make those instant assessments and actions that can sometimes have all too serious consequences. Providing catchy case studies involving experts in everything from marketing to military strategy, Gladwell guides us along a journey of discovery as we come to better comprehend the importance (and mechanics) of the brain's role in processing information that it is abruptly presented with before formulating an immediate response ---all in the time span of milliseconds---.    While there are fascinating points brought up in every chapter of \\"blink,\\" Gladwell ultimately emphasizes that an effective, brief assessment may be more valuable than long periods of analysis spent filling our minds with unnecessary bits of information that can do more harm than good. Often times, there isn't even the opportunity to analyze as we must react off of pure instinct and hope that we made the right decision afterwards.    Read \\"blink.\\" It will change the way you think about thinking.
B00082IJ08|4.0|We're halfway through 2005 (when this review was written) and so far, this is the most enticing, addictive, cotagious, and ear-pleasing album I've heard all year.  Ever since the Gorillaz caught my attention 4 years ago, I've been curious where they were headed next.  And I'm quite pleased with the results. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have noted, if you are looking for the Clint Eastwood or Rock the House sound of the Gorillaz, you wont find it here.  Del (the rapper on the aformentioned songs) and Dan (the producer for the debut) have left for this album, and have been replaced by various other not-so-well-known hip hop artists (and one well known one), and DJ Danger Mouse.  This gives the album an even more expandable musical base than its predecesor.   <br /> <br />The album has a more airy, sunny atmosphere in some spots, while keeping the gritty dark edge of the debut in others, although to a lesser extent.  Whether that is a good thing or not is up to the listener.  I love it! <br /> <br />Over all, \\"Demon Days\\" is not one to pass up.  From track 1 to 16, there are few misses and many direct hits.  Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Highlights: Kids with Guns, Dirty Harry, Feel Good Inc., November Has Come, DARE.
B00080ZG10|3.0|This past year, 2004, was easily one of the weakest years for films in a long while.  There was no \\"Lord of the Rings\\" film to save us from the massive amount of Hollywood drivel force-fed to the public.  For that matter, there were only two standout films from 2004: \\"The Incredibles\\" and \\"Touching the Void.\\"  As far as \\"The Aviator,\\" it stood out mostly because of the fact it was directed by Martin Scorsese.  He does some good work here, but this is nowhere near his best work such as \\"Goodfellas,\\" \\"Raging Bull,\\" or \\"Taxi Driver.\\"  The production in \\"The Aviator\\" is expensive, and everything looks pristine and detailed, but it was really hard to feel any rapport with any of the characters in this film.  All the main characters are either insanely eccentric or diabolically rich.  Leonardo DiCaprio is okay here, but this is certainly not Oscar-caliber work.  His best performance remains his other Oscar-nominated performance in \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\"  That nomination was well-deserved.  Cate Blanchett steals every scene she is in as a young version of the late Katherine Hepburn.  But this performance will only be extraordinary for those who have seen a few Katherine Hepburn movies; for the rest she will seem like yet another weird, outspoken celebrity.  My favorite performance here, bar none, comes from Alan Alda who's character is so slimy and subversive as to be the type of person you love to hate.  In a year of low-level mediocrity in Hollywood, \\"The Aviator\\" certainly does stand up for attention.  But as far as the history of filmmaking is concerned, \\"The Aviator\\" lands smack dab in the middle of the pack.  This is the type of film that will be forgotten in five years.
1400031087|5.0|This book is astounding!  It was a rare and horrifying trip inside the eyeballs of an addict.  I was WITH HIM through his pain, confusion and despair.  As painful as it was to read about Frey's recovery, his writing grabs you by the throat and won't let go!  My eyes read on without my consent.  It is one of the best written books I have experienced.  And this is a book you experience, rather than \\"read,\\" like the best literature.  It's not a book you will \\"enjoy,\\" but one that you will cherish.
B000000OSG|5.0|Great album.  Guns and roses masterpiece.   <br /> <br />3 songs worth mention:november rain, civil war and estranged.  3 of the best rock songs ever.  <br /> <br />only problem: my world.  sorta of a bad way to end an album.   <br /> <br />but whatever guns and roses was cool and like a reviewer already said, dont let one song ruin your thoughts of a great album <br />oh yeah and smartest reviewer may want to try listening to the album instead of just bashing it.
B000028U0Y|5.0|When I hear Cash, I think that must be what God sounds like.  From the second he comes on stage and says, \\"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash,\\" you think you are listening to a higher power.  Cash sounds like he is a Giant on this CD.  He picked a great song selection, playing tracks that match the venue, and not just playing his hit songs.  Except track 12, which is kind of hurting.  He has every prisoner in the palm of his hand, and truely sounds like he is one of them.  Along with \\"Cash at S.Q. Prison,\\" i would say that this is the greatest live album of all time.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Amongst actual bloody asian movies such as Battle Royale, Audition, Ichi etc. there came Oldboy and it was hailed to be a Tarantino-like work of violant art. \\"If you like Tarantino, you're gonna adore Oldboy\\" is what I was told, but then I had already seen it and was really asking myself if these people use their eyes and brains whilst watching a movie. Oldboy is no Tarantino movie by no chance as the main difference between those two directors is that the violence is being represented in a totally different context. In Quentin's movie it serves as a fun factor, but in Oldboy it is exactly what it really is: a destructive, bad kind of power.  <br /> <br />To me, there's a LOT more to this movie than meets the eye. Some people had complaints about the idea of a private prison, others found the suffering of 15 years total isolation not believable enough. The answers at the end seemed too bizarre, culprit and victim don't look the same age but should. etc. <br /> <br />In my opinion, they're kind of looking at the wrong stuff as this movie is succesfully creating a very special situation that could not be created by an all too realistic backstory: that of a man on his personal quest for salvation in a world he only knows from television. From the moment of his isolation on, it's all TV. His life becomes a desperate monolog with a TV, he doesn't see his dead wife with his own living eyes, it also is part of the TV reality. The tv is showing the pictures, the tv is informing him about him being a murder suspect.  <br /> <br />So this man was made to be a monster. His insanity after 15 years of isolation is desperatly seeking for answers to the question: \\"By whom was I made the person I am now? And why?\\" And a monster is what he turned out to be then, a monster that is about to fight (with the help of a hammer) against a huge group of brawling prison guards, there's no holding back, whatever it costs - the answers to his quest has to be his salvation. <br /> <br />But then what we see during his revenging quest is a man falling deeper and deeper while in Kill Bill every act of revenge is another positive step to fulfilment and joy. <br /> <br />Not with Oldboy. It's a drama with a few uncomfortable acts of violence. In the end, that's how violence is: uncomfortable.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Who am I kidding?!  The buzz is still there!  I can't say that \\"Deadwing\\" is on the same level as \\"In Absentia,\\" but then how many albums out there are on that level?  I consider that an unfair comparison.  What \\"Deadwing\\" has are all the trademarks of yet another exceptional Porcupine Tree album: good songwriting, fantastic production value, and incredibly intelligent arrangements.  Steve Wilson simply knows what he's doing.  There are highlights all through this recording, from the headbanging riff during the chorus of the song \\"Shallow\\" to the all-encompassing epic \\"Arriving Somewhere (but not here)\\" with a notable appearance by Mike Akerfeldt from Opeth ripping on his guitar strings.  Personally, I think the album should have started with the track \\"Start of Something Beautiful.\\"  It would have be entirely appropriate.  There is a hidden track at the end, a rocking redux of \\"Shesmovedon\\" from their album \\"Lightbulb Sun,\\" that sounds surprisingly in place and time with the rest of the album.  There is so much to praise on this recording that a full-throated roar of a recommendation is the only thing left to write.  Enough said.
B000001FYL|5.0|On BLAZE OF GLORY, inspired by YOUNG GUNS II, Jon Bon Jovi goes solo. This record proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Jon deserves the band to be titled after him. BOG is just as good as any of the band's records, and better than a lot of them. In fact, there's no filler among these songs, every song memorable and well-composed.  <br /> <br />\\"Billy Get Your Guns\\" is a fast-paced rocker, with a subtly different sound than the band's. It sets the baseline for the rest of the record, and as is often the case with Bon Jovi albums, it outlines the philosophy and message of the record, like \\"Let it Rock,\\" \\"I Believe\\" and \\"Keep the Faith,\\" a song that's absolutely critical to the whole, but most of the time not the best. \\"Miracle\\" is one of the best songs on the record, with great, meaningful lyrics and serious staying power in your head. The title track, \\"Blaze of Glory,\\" is another gem, and fully deserves its place on the greatest hits album. \\"Santa Fe\\" is the best song on the record, with lots of Jon's best lyrics. The epic feel and the heightened emotion in Jon's voice can move you surprisingly deeply for what has been described as a \\"circus act.\\" The vocals and the orchestral background are fantastic, and \\"Santa Fe\\" surely stands out among the great cathartic rock songs. \\"Blood Money\\" is another great song, and another example of how much easier it is to write great songs when you have inspiration from a movie (or a book, in my case. After floundering around for a few years -- I am thirteen, so not so long ago -- I wrote songs for a book I read and after that the creativity locked away in my head broke out and flourished. Am I getting off track?) \\"Justice in the Barrel\\" is a great song, although some people will find the very, very long intro boring. I found it catchy, in an odd, annoying sort of way. It's one of the record's highlights. \\"Never Say Die\\" is one of my favorites, a fast-paced rocker that fools you with the happy-go-lucky beat into thinking it's a happy song. Very catchy, and still managing to touch on serious issues without ever bogging you down. \\"You Got Me Now\\" is a little acoustic surprise with a very country-like sound, a relief from the tons of grief and sadness that is found on this dark record. \\"Bang A Drum\\" is an awesome power ballad about an outlaw finding religion. \\"Dyin' Ain't Much of a Livin'\\" ends the record with a sad song about death and ruin, and one of the most powerful tracks on the record. Jon excels as a songwriter here, and goes out with a bang. Literally, as far as the movie's story goes. A loud bang. A mediocre and unnecessary instrumental, a minute long, finally ends it. \\"Guano City\\" isn't much to remember.  <br /> <br />As a whole, BLAZE OF GLORY is the least flawed of the Bon Jovi albums, solo efforts and band records. There is zero filler except for a minute of \\"Guano City.\\" Every other song is great vocally, lyrically, and pretty good as far as the playing goes. Although it doesn't come together as solidly as \\"New Jersey\\" or \\"Keep the Faith\\" because of the absolutely stunning songs that those records boast. If \\"Blaze\\" doesn't have the one or two completely mindblowing records that those two records (and don't forget \\"Slippery When Wet\\" has that virtue too) do, it still has the least filler and on average the best quality of songs. \\"Blaze ranks third place easily among Bon Jovi records. This is one to remember.
B000003TA4|5.0|Warning; This is more of a rebuttal to negative reviews and less an in depth analysis of \\"Nevermind.\\" <br /> <br />Its really phenomenal how, for so many people, \\"Nevermind\\" is the most offensive album ever created. Its completely devoid of any real pretensions or political statements yet it inspires considerably more hatred than Oasis, Rage or Eminem combined. I dont know how most people are, but when I encounter a boring or distasteful record, I casually dismiss it. When someone asks what I think of Lenny Kravits, I tell them \\"he doesn't really do it for me.\\" Not \\"they are the embodiement of all that is evil\\" and certainly not \\"Im glad that/hope they committ depression induced suicide for forcing their horrible music unto me.\\" In this regard, its obvious that most people uniquely despise Nirvana because they are \\"overrated.\\" <br /> <br />I'll be the first to say that Cobain is a mediocre guitar player. I was just as insulted as the next man when Rolling Stoned put him in the top twenty all-time. It would be folly in the extreme to call him a mediocre musician, though. There is more to good music than technical mastery. The Pixies, the Clash, Janes Addiction: None of these bands featured particularly amazing guitarists but they succeed anyway on INGENUITY. Dont get me wrong, I love bands like Dream Theater, Rush, or Led Zeppelin. But there is something to be said for a band that succeeds by focusing its energy on songwriting rather than jamming and intrumental prowess.  <br /> <br />Like the Ramones before them, Nirvana was being experimental. They wanted to strip grunge down to its bear essentials: chords and melody. To make an interesting album with these as your only parameters is difficult. Its not an option for the songwriter to include ornamental \\"tricks\\" such as weird rhythms, cool riffs, or song structure in making the album more original. He must explore the very essance of melodic and chordal structure and screw around with it. This is what Nirvana does.Their hooks are undeniably catchy yet they dont resolve in any traditional sense. Ideas such as leading tones or dissonant tension, instinctual for most songwriters (Including Pearl Jam who are decent and The Pixies who are fricken amazing), are thrown out the window by Cobain. As for the whole \\"he didn't know what the hell he was doing\\" accusation, he obviously knew what sounded good. The man listened to the Beatles and he was aware of the departure his music was making from mainstream pop. YES, Nirvana stole from The Pixies but (gasp) the infallible Pixies stole from Billy Idol and David Bowie. Its funny how other reviwers cite Gouge Away as the template for \\"Nevermind.\\" Compare Gouge Away to White Wedding and you'll find an even closer similarity. Does this make The Pixies hacks. Fluck no! This makes them musical geniuses. All creativity  is based on this. Any of the greats will tell you that \\"Good musicians borrow, but great musicians steal\\" is no empty proverb.
B000003TAR|5.0|<br />A previous reviewer stated that Nirvana isn't like those \\"gayass gangsta rappers\\". Can you say homophobe, hon? Nirvana didn't want fans like those people who hated others and used deragoatory staements like that. Kurdt wanted peace love and empathy for all mankind. He had apaty for the layabouts that didn't seek to expand their horizons through his trippy and empepheral music. Some NIRVANA fans need to take some lithium and sip some penny royal tea and just chill. <br /> <br />best song: FFWHHROS <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|4.0|my fav songs on the album are: we belong together, stay the night,get your number, your girl. ihated the song its like that, but when i heard we belong together, i had to get this album it sounded so good, i liked the rnb popish sound to it. i love the old school sound to stay the night. sounds like a song she remaked a long time ago. i totally love this song. we belong together and stay the night are 2 of the songs on this album that you can finish listening to from beginning to end. i love jermaines intro to get your number \\"oh damn the club bout to close in a minite\\" he sure added spice to the song but as soon as mariah started singing, i skipped to the next song cuz her sound is gettin a bit boring. your girl sounded nice but again i couldnt finsih listenin to it. mariah is 35 and her music is very immature and girly. she should grow up and start singing about other things in life. and she needs to stop posing her full body pic on her cd covers cuz her body is not that pleasant to look at it and we all know that it has been harsh airbrushed!
0316096199|5.0|The second you open Lucky and read the first few sentences, you are automatically hooked. This was my first time reading a story with this topic and was blown away. Lucky is a very well written story that conveys the confusion and meaningless of the attack Alice encounters and the effects it has on her, her friends and family, and the community. This book was an overall easy read although the description of the rape is very disturbing. This is a book that everyone both male and female should read for a better understanding of what is unfortunately an all too common occurrence for many people. The story helps us to comprehend the battle that sexual assault victims have to wage in order to reclaim their lives and identity and re-establish trust in the human race so they can begin to live without fear and terror of every person they meet.  <br /> <br />
B000000H6D|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this album.  It has something to offer to everyone and Black No. 1 will offer 2 things.. a smile to your face and a headbang.  I know a lot of TON makes you wanna sit in a dark corner and watch the rain roll down your window, but they do sometimes make you wanna go rob a store naked with a black water gun.  Well, only me.  But on a serious note, I know you will enjoy this album and I highly recommend it.  Buy it, listen to it, and get ready to 'gothitize'.  Only goths know what i'm talking about.  Well, go ahead and click the BUY button, you wont regret.
B000002KB8|5.0|Black Sabbath (1970.) Black Sabbath's debut album. <br /> <br />Black Sabbath was unlike anything ever heard before in 1970. This British-born metal band released music that would revolutionize the music industry. Ozzy and his bandmates changed rock history as we know it. <br /> <br />The introduction to the album beings with the title track, \\"Black Sabbath\\". Apart from the eerie cover, this is the track that would scare the listener to death. The slow and hellish theme of the song contains scary lyrics and awesome riffs. On to the second track, \\"The Wizard\\". This track starts off with Ozzy playing the harmonica. Then the song commenses with all the instruments following the harmonica. Great riffs. The lyrics might not be the best, but they suit this song perfectly. I really love this track. Next on the album is the combined four songs of \\"Wasp, Behind the Wall of Sleep, Basically, N.I.B.\\" The track starts off with a catchy tune and nice guitar licks. Ozzy's vocals fit the track well, and rock. About 3:30 into the song, the music slowly fades. It then fades back in with a great bass solo that starts off N.I.B. Now I must say, this is an incredible song. No joke. Great tune, great tune. \\"Wicked World\\" is up next, keeping an upbeat rhythm, very catchy guitar. Ozzy's vocals seem a bit different than the rest of the song, but are great, nonetheless. \\"A Bit Of Finger, Sleeping Village, Warning\\" starts off with a nice acoustic guitar tune. Then after a little while of softer music, it stops for a split-second, then returns to a mediocre-fast pace, as seen on some of the other tracks. This is the longest and most ranged-style'd song featured on this album. Towards the end of the song, a great guitar solo is played. Very nice song. <br /> <br />Black Sabbath was a key factor in changing music. The band was an instant hit and remains extremely popular to the day. If you are just getting into Black Sabbath, I would SERIOUSLY recommend their debut album, you will NOT regret it.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|I bought this cd thinking it might be decent because I saw that BYOB had the most hits on the guitar webpage i go to, even more than stairway to heaven.  I don't currently live in the states right now so I hadn't heard it on the radio. So 14 dollars later and throwing the cd away brings me here. Don't know a thing they are talking about. How do they talk about rich people in Hollywood when that it what they are. I also recently read an article in entertainment magazine with SOAD and the Mars Volta talking about Prog Rock.  This is the worst Prog Rock cd ever.  All the songs sound just alike except for the disco sounding song. If you want a new, good Prog Rock cd buy THE MARS VOLTA, FRANCES THE MUTE!!  Never again will I buy a SOAD cd. By the way SOAD is a bunch of stuck up a@#$%^*s.

0800141660|5.0|Emma Thompson wrote the screenplay for and stars in this excellent adaptation of Jane Austen's novel \\"Sense and Sensibility\\". Thompson is wonderful as Elinor Dashwood, in love with Edward Ferrars. Hugh Grant is good as Edward, in love with Elinor, but unsure if she returns his love, since she is so restrained in her actions, she doesn't show her feelings. Kate Winslet shines as Marianne, who is passionate about life and doesn't believe in hiding her emotions. Alan Rickman, in a nice guy role for a refreshing change, is excellent as Colonel Brandon, who is in love with Marianne. Greg Wise, Harriet Walter, and Hugh Laurie are also excellent in supporting roles.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has long been my favorite Jane Austen novel. But this movie brought \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" to life so well that I now want to reread that novel and live in Jane Austen's world yet again.
0066620996|5.0|First of all, it is a great book and it really enlightens me on what drives those good companies to become great companies. Before I read this book, I couldn't see factors that define between good and great. But Jim has brought me to reach certain level to see quite clearly. Moreover I've seen the inside view on culture of good to great companies in terms of leadership, disciplines and concepts. It was very helpful to understand Jim's finding using comparison between two companies, one achieved good to great transition and one doesn't. I've been convinced why the good is the enemy of the great and learned why a lot of companies have failed to become great companies. Jim and his team have proved the leadership is one of the factors to achieve good to great transformation. But only level 5 leaders can drive the company to become a great one or achieve to higher level by setting up good values. Getting right people for the company plays a vital role and they must have some degree of freedom. It is also important for the executive and his team to face the brutal facts to maintain or build the growth of the company. While the company is building its momentum, it must consistent with clear concept and persistent discipline to achieve visible result which will energize its people. Then it starts cycle of flywheel and it can be accelerated by using technology and acquisitions. Over the time, the company will become a great company and earn a dramatic result which can be perceived as overnight success from outside. This book has unveiled factors which most good companies missed and failed to implement. I am sure that Jim's findings can be applied to other management bodies to achieve objectives.

B0007TKNL0|4.0|The long-awaited film of Andrew Lloyd-Webber's musical is not perfect, but director Schumacher surprises us enough to turn out perhaps the best of several screen versions of the famous tale. <br /> <br />On the negative side, the two leads (Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum) lack vocal strength: His singing voice is annoyingly grating at times; and she sings through her nose too much. The visual style is a tad inconsistent, with Christine and the Phantom's first descent into the underworld looking too much like a pop video, and some of the more frenetic, Moulin-Rouge-inspired camerawork lacking in life. The additions occasionally detract from the flow, especially the unnecessary flashback to the Phantom's adolescence. <br /> <br />In its favour is much, however. Lloyd-Webber's vision was always the most faithful to the original story, capturing Leroux's romance and fantasy as well as the horror. Despite the lack of vocal strength, Butler excels dramatically as a tortured anti-hero who invites compassion and understanding as well as terror; the tension between his tragic loneliness and his violent hatred against humanity is well-conveyed. Among the support, I most enjoyed Miranda Richardson's Madame Giry and Simon Callow's Andre. <br /> <br />The new orchestrations do the music justice. The choreography, like the visual style, is inconsistent, but there are nevertheless some truly splendid numbers, staged with an eye for spectacle as well as a good sense of humour (e.g. Prima Donna). For the most part, despite the very obvious influence, Schumacher avoids mimicking the chaotic pace of Moulin Rouge, and the camera work is generally subtle at the right times. <br /> <br />All the layers of the story are held nicely in balance, making The Phantom of the Opera a moving romantic fantasy, and very much the exhilarating experience that the stage show has always been.
B000063JDE|1.0|Some have found this movie to be daringly shocking.  The only shocking thing that I found about this movie is that some many great actors let themselves participate in such a bad movie.  At the start of this pointless film, it seems interesting and full of suspence, but it soon becomes overly melodramatic and the plot becomes boring.  If you like dry, poorly made movies that have no qualities of redemption, this is the movie for you.  If you have any amount of self respect, stay far away from this film.
1841491799|4.0|The first book, Storm of Wings, began with a typical boy-runs-away-from-home-turned-adventurer, except that the boy did not get apprenticed to powerful wizards nor warriors but learned to ride a dragon before getting conscripted into the war. He had enough sense and survived the war to become a veteran. After his unit got wiped out, the second part of the book began with heavy resemblance to WE Johns Biggles stories in the World War One when (military) aviation was in its infancy. <br /> <br />In fact, the whole development of the war and the stalemates were lifted almost directly from the events of World War One with disastrous results in attempts of breakthrough. Those familiar with the Great War could identify Somme as well as Gallipoli. <br /> <br />The second book Knighthood of the Dragon continued the war between Dermaine (Britain) and Sagene (France) on one side, and Roche (Germany) on the other. Here, the author adapted an episode from World War Two - The Great Escape. Eventually, Hal Kailas's side managed to break through and take the war into the lands of the Roche, despite it being slow going. The change of the nature of warfare in real world history to include destruction of civilian properties in order to starve the enemy into submission was also reflected. Hal Kailas ended the war as a hero and a lord. <br /> <br />The final book - The Last Battle, began with the end of the war. Veteran Hal Kailas who found himself enriched and ennobled found frustrations as he could not find a new meaning in his life - leading to the estrangement with his wife. He finally sought to do something - to repay the dragons for their contributions to the war, by finding out what caused the dragons to flee from their original unknown homelands across the Great Sea. <br /> <br />In this series, dragons were depicted as little more than aerial steeds adapted for war, with hardly more than animal intelligence. The dragons did not speak, breath fire nor cast magic. In fact, mankind had little fear of them, finding them nuisance to animal husbandry and even bully their youngs. The dragons did not have sufficient intelligence to recognise their innate advantages. <br /> <br />Hal put together an expedition to sail to find the mysterious original homeland of the dragons. <br /> <br />SPOILERS follows! <br /> <br />After some adventures, Hal discovered the dragons were fleeing demons. This could be taken directly from the movie Evolution, whereby an alien entity (the demon) entered the world, and began multiplying itself, taking the forms of the mightiest creature it encountered, through a series of speedy evolution. <br /> <br />While there was nothing really original in the series, the author's attention to details and ability to answer questions in the readers' mind through his narration was to be commended. <br /> <br />The author indeed convinced us that the \\"heroes\\" in the book knew what they were doing instead of being small-minded characters.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.<br />I was expecting an exploration of the successful career of Hughes aviation enterprises. And that part was very interesting,<br />But the exploration into Hughes' nightmarish condition we know today as OCD, (something that he could have been helped greatly today that was basically untreatable then), was at once heartbreaking and fascinating. The blending of the portrayal of a genius and someone crippled by mental illness is done very well in this film and is acted quite well.
B0007P3582|1.0|50 cent round 2. he hit us with \\"the massacre\\" with his rhymes SLIGHTLY stepped up which would put him now in the D category for grades. i do have to question how this guy is so tough in his rhymes and poses with numerous guns but has a restraining order on vivica a fox and irv gotti? as i recall neither of them have harmed the 5-0 police snitch. so why have this restraining order? aren't you man enough to tell vivica face to face when she wants an explanation for the split between them? apparently not. ha! and the bullet proof vest for his son? ha! don't let your mouth write checks that your a$$ can't cash, 50! don't talk trash to jada and fat joe cuz they don't play! as you see he's already scared. plus rolling with a slew of bodyguards doesn't make you gangsta, it shows how weak you are! oh man anyway back to his music after i let the truth be told. anyway didn't this 50 guy say that he was sick of ja rule singing and if you wanna hear the real gangsta rap buy my album? i'm not quoting him but yes that was his strategy. a good one in fact that seemed to show him doing the opposite. countless songs have 50 crooning away in the chorus like this is a drifters album or something. \\"now featuring the king of motown, the wonderfully talented, tenor voiced, the heartbreaking 50 cent!\\" i can see it right now. stop singing man! if u wanna sing then make amends with ja rule!
B00005JNEW|4.0|Director:  Peter Berg. <br />Cast:  Billy Bob Thornton, Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, Lee Jackson, Lee Thompson Young Tim McGraw, Connie Britton. <br />Running Time:  118 minutes. <br />Rated PG-13 for language and some sexual references and content. <br /> <br />Although nothing that we have not seen before, \\"Friday Night Lights\\" makes up for unoriginality and mediocre, erratic cinematography with superb, sincere performances from a great ensemble cast of unknown youngsters, a beautifully crafted musical score from Brian Reitzell, and tremendously compelling football action.  The film ambits the trials and tribulations of the 1988 Odessa-Permian high school football squad in search of a state championship, but with an in-depth look into the true reality and significance of football on the lives of all that it touches in a small Texas community, \\"Friday Night Lights\\" proves to be more than just a run-of-the-mill sports drama. <br /> <br />Billy Bob Thornton appends a unique role to his impressive resume, playing head Permian coach Gary Gaines, a well-respected leader of his troops but always under intense pressure from the Odessa faithful to be the best.  While Thornton may be the well-known star of the film, the film spotlights the metamorphosis of the team's courageous season through the eyes of the players:  quiet team captain Mike Winchell (performed exceptionally well by Lucas Black) not only has to lead his team to victory, but has the sole responsibility of taking care of his unhealthy mother; back-up halfback Don Billingsly (Garrett Hedlund) must live in shadow of his former Permian star father (Tim McGraw) and survive the continuous harsh criticism from the man who wants him to succeed the most; and the eccentric Boobie Miles (Derek Luke, star of \\"Antoine Fisher\\"), an incredibly tantalizing force on the football field, who must fight through injuries and life in the limelight. <br /> <br />\\"Friday Night Lights\\" is based on the bestselling novel written by H.G. Bissinger (who happens to be director Peter Berg's cousin) and is adapted brilliantly by David Aaron Cohen and Berg.  \\"Friday Night Lights\\" is not the easiest film to stomach (not due to violence, but because of some abnormal jerkiness of the camera), but the film is driven by the splendid supporting performances of McGraw and Luke.  Thornton is very convincing as the demanding, hard-nosed coach who believes in perfection, but ultimately shows his depth as an actor as he exponentially augments Coach Gaines sincerity and heart as the film progresses.  Not quite \\"The Field of Dreams\\" of the football drama genre, but a great sport drama nonetheless that will certainly touch those who understand the meaning of high school sports to teenagers who play them.  One of the best \\"half-time\\" speeches in film history.  A touching, heartfelt drama. <br />
B00012FXAE|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater. I remember looking at the audience when the shuttle crashed into the screen, everyones heads were leaned as far back as possible. I bring this up to point ut how engrossing the film was. I recently bought the special edition DVD. The extra scenes increased the character development,and made this movie even better than before. sci fi and horror at its best. If not for the terribly foul language of the Marines I would recomend this movie for anyone who likes a scare.

B0007LXPBI|5.0|I have this movie on both video and DVD and this DVD is the third Parent Trap I own, and they are all three the Lindsay <br />Lohan one. This DVD has more authentic, awesome features. It's worth buying. This is actually my favorite movie in this whole <br />wide world. I love it so much! Lindsay is my favorite actress and it's amazing to see her talking back when she was just a kid <br />and you see her years later in 'Confessions of a teenage Drama Queen' and 'Freaky Friday' and soon in 'Herbie: Fully Loaded'! This is a cool DVD, and I think you should buy it to! <br /> <br />--Quick Note-- <br />Before you see the sequel to a movie, <br />make sure you see the original movie <br />first then you'll understand the second <br />movie more. Because I saw this movie <br />before I saw the Haylie Mills one and I <br />tottaly did not like it as much as I did <br />this one. I Mean, it was okay but it <br />was not as much fun! So, that's all.
044022165X|5.0|I am a big John Grisham fan.  This book was so great. It started with so much excitement and energy. I read a chapter a day. Many times it was hard to stop. I was a bit disappointed with the ending.  I actually expected it to end after the case. The remaining chapters could have been excluded.
0805079076|5.0|This book is a very interesting attempt to present an explanation for the origin of some of the features of today's language structures. The author does not try to go back to the very beginning of language itself, but takes his story from the point where words already existed, but most grammatical structure had not yet evolved, still before any language of which a record survives. <br /> <br />The author uses examples in present-day languages to illustrate processes in linguistic evolution that are currently taking place or have taken place recently enough to be well documented. This lends a lot of credibility to his ideas. <br /> <br />Because the author was born in Israel (presumably having modern Israeli Hebrew as his first language) and has become a specialist in Semitic historical linguistics, he presents more examples from Semitic languages than one often sees in popular linguistics books intended for the English-language reader, but it is all written in a very easily understood way, and I find the book as readable as if it had been written by a native speaker of English, though with a few signs that the English which the author learned was more British than American.  <br /> <br />There is only one negative comment I would make, and that does not sufficiently detract from the value of the book that I would deny it a 5-star rating: I wish that the author would more clearly separate his own personal speculations from the ideas which are believed by the majority of linguistics professionals. It is clear that a lot of the ideas presented in this book are the author's own, but it is not clear how many.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember written by Nicholas Sparks is one of the best books I have ever read. After reading The Notebook I feel in love with Nicholas Sparks writing. This book, just as The Notebook, filled my body with emotions that I never knew I could feel by simply reading a fictional story.  There were parts in the book that left me with enormous smiles. However, there were times in this book where I had to stop and put it aside to take a minute to breathe and wipe away my tears.  On a complete opposite, I felt guilt reading this novel. All of the emotion and feeling that was put into this book by the author is what I think makes it so unforgettable. <br /> Landon Carter was just a normal, 17 year old, attending high school in the small town of Beaufort, North Carolina.  He was fortunate enough to be wealthy, attractive and envied by most at school.  Jamie Sullivan was his polar opposite.  She was the minister's daughter.  She stayed at home every night, reading her bible and sometimes went to visit the children at the orphanage.  She wore her hair in a bun with a long skirt and an old brown sweater.  Both Jamie and Landon hold the position of main characters in this book.  Because I had seen the movie before I read this book, I had a crystal clear image of them in my head, but if it wasn't for the excellent description from Nicholas Sparks, I don't think I could have truly felt and understood what they went through during the book.   <br /> Be yourself, and no matter what, as long as you are happy with who you are, good things will come your way.  This is the message that author is trying to get across to his wide range of readers.  As I read the story, I really could see how each character related to it.  In Jamie's case, she was the happiest girl alive, she brought her bible everywhere she went and didn't mind what anyone said about her ugly, old, brown sweater.  She was completely content with herself and nothing fazed her.  In Landon's case, he fell in love withJamie, and was doing what everyone thought he would never do (date the most unpopular girl in school).  But Jamie made Landon happy and made him realize all the good that he was capable of doing, making him feel like a better person in the end.  Over all, the message was very clear and the outcome of the theme obvious.  I think it is a great message because each and every person who reads this can follow through with it and use it in their own lives.  You can see that by what the characters felt from inside truly made them happy, and that can easily be accomplished by anyone who sets their minds and hearts to it.   <br /> <br />
B00097DX3U|5.0|I was a big fan of the first Audioslave cd and have always been a fan of Soundgarden. I see alot of reviews on this cd. Many people are bashing it. Why? <br />This is not Soundgarden or Rage Against the Machine. It has its own feel and sound. Chris Cornell has that haunting voice that fits with some of the best musicians of the past 15 years. I have read all the stories of how this \\"supergroup\\" would never last. This cd is proff they are really a band now. It seems like the music comes easy to these guys when they are together.  <br />\\"Out of Exile\\" grows on you the more you listen to it, just like the first Audioslave cd. <br />\\"Dandelion\\" , \\"Yesterday and Tomorrow\\", and \\"Doesn't Remind me\\" really stand out to me. <br /> <br />Take time and check this cd out. Rock is not dead after all.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I love this film, it's so good and beautifull and sad in a way. But anyone who doesn't understand and likes this film is a complete idiot and not a real movie critic at all! Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) are two lost souls in Japan who meet and soon become freinds and venture off into Japan and often enounter halarious people and soon see that maybe theres more to lifes possibilities! Sofia Cappola is the master of moments and it's what the movie-generation has been begging to be made! It's sweet quite and unique way of showing hope and unexpected connections that we make that might not last long but yet stay with us forever. My favorite film of all-time!
B00005JG6Q|5.0|This movie was 124 minutes long but I loved it. I don't care weather the orginal version that came to America on vhs in the 90's had different english voice actors. On this dvd it has were you can pick captions to appear during the movie, it's shap like a giant pill like the one Kaneda has on the back of his coat. The first war began in 1988 after Akira distoryed everything the Tokyo was turn into Neo-Tokyo after re-molding the ruins. In the year 2019 it happens again when Tetsuo can't control his power and starts mutation then the three kids calls Akira, but thats bought all I'm going to give you.
B00005T30L|5.0|Enid (Birch) and Rebecca (Johansson) are two punks who just make fun of everybody around them and now they just graduated from High School. This enters into the teenage boredom of everyday subberban life, but from there on it gets a whole lot complicated. When they make a practical joke on a geek who is a 40 something year old man, Seymore (Buscemi) who only lives for his records, Inid feels oddly attracted to him and needs him more than she ever knew possible, and her world gets completely turned upside down and makes some big changes including her long-life freindship. This is not a teen-comedy film but a comedy-drama, I loved it! If you like \\"Rushmore\\" then you gonna like this one, more than just a comedy it's something deeper and sad.
B00000JLWW|5.0|While this DVD rocks---the presentation is flawless (but a huge lack of special features)---wait for the Special Editions releasing October 18.

0062502182|1.0|Contrived. Pretentious. Juvenile. That's just the introduction, in which the author discusses his amazement at the popularity this book has gained. It is equally astonishing for any reader who is able to endure more than five pages of: \\"The Soul of the World spoke to the Heart of the Boy as he prayed to the God of the Dessert who commanded the Spirit of the Wind...\\" I found myself praying to the God of Literature that the boy's beloved sheep would stampeded and trample him to death, sparing me from the Demons of Boredom. If you liked the Celestine Prophecy you'll love The Alchemist. You can read it while you're waiting for the mothership to return. Otherwise, take a pass and read something more intellectually engaging, like the tax code. <br />
0743454529|2.0|Jodi Picoult once again tackles a difficult, controversial issue, and I have to admire her effort.  But the book just isn't that good.  As is often the case in Picoult's novels, the characters, although human and flawed, are remarkably unsympathetic.  As is often the case in Picoult's novels, there is an extraneous romance that offers nothing to the plot and if anything detracts from the heart of the story.  Jodi Picoult can tell a wonderful story, only occasionally getting bogged down in moralizing that pulls away from the courtroom action, and she almost succeeds in pulling off something brilliant.  However, the novel's ending is, plain and simple, a cop-out.  Whether it's to attempt to keep from offending people, or because Picoult herself couldn't figure out how to get the outcome she wanted, or didn't know what she wanted at all, but with the final pages of the novel, Picoult manages to eclipse the courage of the stark honesty of the first 400 pages with an ending that is utterly contrived and unsatisfying.  To make matters worse, the book didn't even need that much of an ending.  She didn't need to tie up these particular ends of the story.  She could have has a masterpiece.  But then, if the book was satisfying and didn't have a contrived, convoluted moment that completely negated everything that came before and, often, what comes after it, it wouldn't be a Jodi Picoult novel.
B00007AJF8|5.0|Spike Jonze has directed a film about people who want to get lost inside a portal of a celebrity John Malkovich and as such has made a film that is an allegory of our age: a society of tormented souls, who loathing their perceived mundane existence, seek transcendence by living vicariously through a celebrity. In our tabloid-soaked culture where we want our celebs dished out to us for our feasting, we now take our worship a step further: live inside and takeover a celebrity; get inside his brain and try to render our sense of being invisible by being John Malkovich.<br /><br />Great idea but how does the film work in terms of pacing, plotline, and coherence? Amazingly, the narrative is tight and follows easily enough. The satire is always two steps ahead of us. There are too many laugh-outloud surprises in here to mention. But beneath the satire is a brooding, tormented meditation on a society that, without the razzle-dazzle of celebrity, is overcome by a sense of worthlessness and ennui.
B00063MBU8|1.0|Yeah so this album... <br /> <br />Well that's pretty much all the time I'll spend contemplating the value of it.
0800177177|4.0|I'll come right out and say it: This is not a horror movie. It's a supernatural love story. The fact that this is really about romance could have been a strength (the original book by Bram Stoker has a lot to do with Victorian sexuality) but was handled poorly and thus becomes a huge weakness for the effectiveness of the movie. Gary Oldman's Dracula has existed in a lonely bitter, blood gurgling rage for roughly 400 years and is sick with love for.....Winona Rider.  <br /> <br />She's horrible! This might be her worst performance ever. Her squeaking, simpering Mina (an impressive character in the book) is so unappealing that you feel sorry for Dracula. Clearly, both the poor guy's eyesight and memory have failed him over the centuries.  <br /> <br />The other leads are poorly treated. Lucy's three suitors are reduced to character types. Jonathan Harker is so dumb that you wish he'd just die and be done with it. I love Anthony Hopkins but his Van Helsing is mean and more than a little nuts. Lucy's been turned into a nymphomaniac. The only sympathetic person in the movie is the vampire. <br /> <br />There is no real tension, no jump in your seat moments and nothing to fear. You don't care about Jonathan or Lucy and Mina is clearly in no real danger. Dracula doesn't want to turn her into dinner. He wants his happy home restored. How he was planning on explaining his three lesser brides back at the castle to Mina is never dealt with but it would've been a hoot of a scene.  <br /> <br />The movie is very pretty. The scenery, the costumes, the music are all well done. The date scenes are romantic and Harker's carriage ride to the castle is actually great but if you want a horror movie you'd be better off looking up Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee's work instead.

B00000ILE7|4.0|Everyone around the world seemed to have really enjoyed ALIEN and ALIENS. In 1992, David Fincher had directed, ALIEN 3, the third installment to the most terrifying series in Science Fiction history.  <br /> <br />RIPLEY (again played by Sigourney Weaver) is back for a third round with this world's horrifying creature. Ripley is still in hypersleep with Bishop, Hicks, and Newt. But a face-hugger has snuck onto their ship and secretly implanted an alien to one of them. The ship crash lands on the planet, Furinia 161, a maximum security prison that is located in the far corners of the solar system. Hicks was thrown and impaled, killing him off. Newt had died after her lungs were filled with fluid. Bishop was smashed beyond repair. Only Ripley is left alive. The prison, which is inhabited by men, rescue Ripley. They hold her at the prison, but not as a prisoner. They called the health division, who will be picking her up within a week. She finally wakes and meets CLEMENS (played by Charles Dance), the prison doctor, who was a former prisoner. The prison's head is ANDREWS (Brian Glover), a careless person, who seems like he does not give two hoots about what happens. His assistant is the innocently stupid, AARON (played by Ralph Brown). He is not what anybody would call stupid. But his IQ is around 85. Among the prison staff is DYLON (played by Charles S. Dutton), the minister-type of person. Among the prisoners is MOORSE (played by Danny Webb), the foul-mouth-full-of-attitude type of guy. Ripley finds the remains of Bishop and plugs him into the computer. Ripley had a fear of an alien being created in the prison is confirmed by Bishop. She unplugs Bishop at his request, for he reveals that he cannot be repaired. Ripley finds that Bishop was right in revealing the alien's existence when the bodies of some of the prisoners begin mounting. This alien is different. It does not walk on two legs as the others that Ripley has seen. This one has the body structure of a dog, since it has gestated inside a dog that was once owned by one of the prisoners. Now, Ripley and the prisoners are without any hi-tech equipment and hi-tech weapons to destroy the alien. They must find another way to destroy the alien.  <br /> <br />The alien kills off Clemens and Andrews. Ripley, Dylon, and Aaron team up with the other prisoners to destroy the alien. But the plan goes awry when the alien screws everything up. Ripley suddenly starts feeling very ill. She has a cat-scan done, with the help of Aaron. He reveals that Ripley has an alien inside her chest. Ripley was the one who had been impregnated by the face-hugger before the ship crashed. She requests that Dylon kill her off, since she'll be dead anyway. But killing her before the alien busts through her chest will kill both her and the alien. But Dylon promises to kill her until after she helps him kill the alien they are dealing with. Ripley agrees. The other inmates help out, but they are all killed in the process. The only ones left are Morse, Dylon, and Ripley. Dylon breaks his promise when he lets the alien kill him, only to trap the alien in one spot, in order to allow Morse and Ripley to destroy the alien. Their plan was to pour burning hot lead over the alien. But the lead did not work. But Ripley drenches the alien with water. The alien, drenched in hot led and water, suddenly explodes. Before they can leave the boiler room, Aaron approaches with the health division. Leading the health division is...BISHOP (again played by Lance Henrikson). He reveals that he is very human and he creator of the now destroyed android. He informs Ripley that he is taking her home and will take the alien out of Ripley. Ripley has suspicions of Bishop removing the alien, but keeping it alive, instead of killing it. Ripley backs away and walks over to the nearest boiler. For betraying Ripley, Aaron stupidly hits Bishop in the head with a pipe, where Aaron is shot to death. Ripley makes it to the nearest boiler andlets herself fall into the boiler. As she falls, the alien bursts through her chest. Before the alien can climb out of her chest, Ripley grabs the alien and holds it close. As she holds it, she finally falls into the burning boiler, sadly dying. Morse is taken to another prison as Furinia 161 is being closed up with a tape of Ripley leaving a message from the ending of the first film.  <br /> <br />ALIEN 3 turned out to be the least successful film in the whole series. It was said that when the film opened in the U.S., people walked out of the theater at the end of the film in a disgusted mood. ALIEN 3 was not \\"The Best\\" in the series, but it was definitely amazing. It was sad to see Ripley die, after she had battled the alien three times. But ALIEN 3 is worth watching. So, if you loved ALIEN and ALIENS, try giving ALIEN 3 a shot. You won't enjoy it as much, but you will enjoy it over all.

6305399212|5.0|In 1979, the most terrifying film in Science Fiction history, known as ALIEN, was considered to be one of the best films ever made. In 1986, just seven years after ALIEN, James Cameron came onto the scene to direct a sequel to Ridley Scott's masterpiece. ALIENS was the sequel for James Cameron and it still carries the most terrifying edge as the first had done.  <br /> <br />RIPLEY (again played by Sigourney Weaver) was the only survivor of the last massacre. She escaped through The Nostromo's shuttle and went into hypersleep. But that was now over 57 years ago. Floating around in space, Ripley is found and is taken to a medical health center, making sure that she is okay. Ripley finally awakes and meets CARTER BURKE (played by Paul Reiser). He reveals how long Ripley had been in hypersleep. Ripley begins feeling chest pains, leading into an alien bursting through her chest, but Ripley wakes up in the medical center, realizing that she just had a nightmare.  <br /> <br />Ripley discusses with the government of the massacre she had terrifyingly survived, but the members of the government are in disbelief. They inform Ripley that there are 60 to 70 families of colonists that have since settled on LV-426 and are experiencing no problems with any aliens of any kind. After buying an apartment and taking a job as a construction worker, Ripley is informed by Burke that they have lost contact with the colonists on LV-426. He stops by Ripley's apartment with LT. GORMAN (played by William Hope) to tell Ripley that she is invited to join a team of combats to land on LV-426 and find the colonists, but Ripley rejects the invitation. After awaking from another nightmare, Ripley phones Burke, asking him if the mission is to find the colonists and wipe out the aliens. After getting a confirmation on her question, she accepts the invitation and sets out to destroy the aliens once and for all.  <br /> <br />Ripley is hired on this mission as an assistant boss. There at least 20 combats. Among the combats are HUDSON (played by Bill Paxton), CPRL HICKS (played by Michael Biehn), VASQUEZ (played by Jeanette Goldstein), and BISHOP (played by Lance Henrikson). Bishop is an android. Ripley disapproves of Bishop first time round, for there was a droid with her the first time. The droid was Ash, who seemed to have mal-functioned, trying to kill Ripley. Bishop is a harmless droid, who is friendly with everybody. They set out to LV-426, but they are clueless of what they are getting into. Ripley has already briefed the combats on what they will be dealing with. Once they enter, they find an eight-year-old girl named NEWT(played by Carrie Henn). Ripley takes Newt into her care. As she sits inside with Newt, watching the moniters with Bishop, Goldman, and Burke, the team runs into a mess of the aliens. Most of the team is killed off. The surviving team members are Hicks, Hudson, and Vasquez. They rejoin with Ripley, Burke, Bishop, Gorman, and Newt, and they hi-tale out of there into a safer spot. They find a research facility and hide out there, where hours later, it is revealed that Burke is part of the Science Division, who is to take back anybody impregnated with an alien. The aliens arrive in the building, killing off Burke, Gorman, Vasquez, and Hudson. Hicks, Ripley, Newt, and Bishop are still alive. Bishop is outside, repairing their shuttle ship named, The Soloco. The aliens capture Newt and prepare her for the same face-hugging process. Hicks winds up getting injured. Ripley puts him in Bishop's care, as she goes back inside to rescue Newt. She finds Newt and they head out on their way, but they run into the queen alien. The queen is the egg layer. Ripley destroys all the aliens, but has no time to destroy the queen, for the building is ten minutes away from exploding. Ripley and Newt are on top of the building, ready to board The Soloco with Bishop and Hicks, but The Soloco is gone. Just as the queen alien reaches Ripley and Newt, Bishop rolls around, saving Ripley and Newt. They head back to the main ship safely. Hicks is sedated. As Bishop, Ripley, and Newt come off of The Soloco, Ripley thanks Bishop for his help. But before he can appreciate her thanks, the queen Alien rips Bishop in half. But Ripley kills the alien off by blowing it out of the airlock again. Bishop is fine, for his damages can be easily repaired. As they return to Earth, Hicks, Ripley, Bishop, and Newt wait while in hypersleep.  <br /> <br />If you enjoyed ALIEN, then you'll love its amazing sequel, ALIENS. Featuring more scares, more hi-tech weapons, ALIENS is bound to have you watching it over and over again.
B000002KXV|5.0|I first heard this in 1982 as a teenager, having been weaned on Steely Dan by my older siblings. This remains one of my favorites and I play it quite often. You will not be disappointed.
B00000AF95|2.0|The mid eighties was not the best time for Kiss records. Especially Genes songs were terrible, just listen to the ones on this record (\\"While the city sleeps\\" is an exception, a pretty good song). Paul also struggles, but he's got some decent songs on this one. I liked this record when it was released, but would not listen to it today. Thrills in the night is a very cool song, but it is too slow.
B000001ELR|4.0|The sheer amount of heaviness and the quality of composition of this album easily turn it into one of the best studio albuns of the KISS catalogue. I enjoy it a lot.<br /><br />The nine songs are very good, very catchy, very heavy, even with different guitarists filling Ace's job. There is a lot of outside contribution in the writing department (including Bryan Adams!!!), but this worked alright.<br /><br />This ia very satisfying album.
0765309408|4.0|Many of the reviews have taken note of the similarities between this book and Heinlein's Starship Troopers.  The comparison is apt.  The author's style is reminiscent of Heinlein's, as well as both the tone of the book and the plot.  I like this book a lot, but it does have a few weaknesses.  For one, humanity is depicted as weaker than many of the races that we confront, yet our first impulse seems to shoot first and negotiate after, if at all.  Not a smart strategy in a Universe where we have few friends.  This idea is noted in the book but quickly glossed over.  Secondly, the bodies of people who sign up but die before induction into the military are used as clone soldiers, but only one clone per body.  What's the point?  If they want to clone people, why only dead people?  And what are the economics of this project?  Is it really cheaper to clone a body, then raise it, equip it and educate it?  I wonder.  And the ending, quite simply, is just a little too pat, assuming that everything is going to turn out just fine in a universe where the death rate from combat is 75%.  Nevertheless, the books characterization, dialogue and generally engrossing plot make this book much better than the average sci-fi potboiler.  Recommended.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Yeah this movie was a little corny but it was funny and it invoked the joy of the Christmas season.  Also, I could watch this with my children and my mom- unlike Bad Santa and a few others I could mention. <br /> <br />The story was a little implausible but it was very sweet. <br /> <br />The Elf finds his way to his natural father and helps the man to discover the menaing of the Christmas spirit  and the true valus of family. And he helps save Santa and Christmas too. <br /> <br />In true Will Ferrell fashion, there is alot of physical humor but the movie is laugh out loud funny and it is sure to be one that you will want to watch again every Christmas
B0001YRVN4|5.0|These movies were excellent when they came out and still are. They put Episodes I, II, and III all to shame.
B00005JMJG|3.0|I did not like this movie but others did and to each their own.   <br /> <br />No matter how much I wish it could be so, I did not think that the premise was realistic.  Bad relationship so poof- it is gone out of your mind.  Nothing to learn from.  No memory of the mistakes retained.   <br /> <br />Jim Carrey's character (Joel) is dating Kate Winslet's character (Clementine) and they are having a rocky relationship.  He learns that she has gone to a doctor to have him and their relationship erased from her mind and he decides to do the same.  However, during the procedure, he changes his mind and tries to retain his memories of her. <br /> <br />As I said, the premise was interesting but I did nt like the movie.  I guess it just did not click for me.  Also, the way the movie skipped around from past happenings to the current days to Jim Carrey's character's hallucinations during the erasing procedure were a bit jarring for me. <br /> <br />I did not see any performance worthy of an Oscar which is probably why Kate Winslet did not win.  However, I did give the movie three stars due to the work of Kirsten Dunst.  In my opinion, the scenes with her character stole the movie completely away from the boring tale of Joel and Clementine and she is the one who had me sitting up with interest after I had written this movie off.  I do not want to spoil anything by saying any more about her. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007Y08QA|5.0|When I set down to watch this movie. I had know idea I would come out of the theatre just mesmerized. This movie was Christian Bale at his best. When has he not done better than mediocre work. The film is truly breathtaking and needs to be wached twice to really grasp what is going on.  <br />The character development may be a little slow , but Bale carries the weight throught the entire film. The best film of 2004!
B0007CNXUK|3.0|This movie is the story of how JM Barrie came up with his ideas for Peter Pan and the first showing of the play.  I am not a critic but I know what I like. <br /> <br />I did not really like this movie overall, but I liked parts of it enough to give it three stars. <br /> <br />I think Johnny Depp is awesome in almost every thing he stars in and he is equally as good in this.  His accent was great and he really made me feel like he was the kid at heart who could create a place such as Neverland and have us believe.  It was as though he became the man he was playing.  <br /> <br />I did not really care for Kate Winslet or her character but this could be because the character was not fleshed out as much.  She was merely a woman who went along for the ride as JM Barrie and her children bonded. The movie gave no insight into why she was so willing to just go along with them or why she neglected her health when she was the only parent her children had.  However, to Ms. Winslet's credit, the same could be argued of most of the other characters.  The only character who we were given any insight into was Mr. Barrie.   <br /> <br />THE STORY: <br /> <br />Mr. Barrie had just made a play that flopped and then he was moping in the park and met 4 boys and their mother.  The boys are sad over the recent death of their father.  He starts to spend time with them and he brings out their ability to use their imagination and to create plays.  He then starts to create his vision of Neverland and his characters of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. <br /> <br />I liked alot of this movie because it showed how absolutely wonderful imagination is and how it can make you flourish, the way it did for the boys.  Also, it showed how stuffy and unimaginative we are as adults and sometimes it takes a child to show us how to enjoy ourselves.  I won't ruin a great scene by telling it here.   <br /> <br />As I said, all in all, it was a goood movie but I would not have nominated it for an Oscar.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|System has failed to match my expectations. After coming out with two great albums \\"System Of A Down\\" and \\"Toxicity\\", I guess they just ran out of material. My main disappointment about this album is the lyrics. I haven't heard an album with more meaningless and downright stupid lyrics than this album has. Sure \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" and \\"Soldier Side\\" have a point but they're not anythng half the country hasn't already said before. Not only are the lyrics stupid but there are barely any lyrics at all. Each song is just about 3-4 lines repeated over and over again. Besides for the lyrics being poor, there is way too much Daron on this album. It could be nice and refreshing to hear Daron once in a while on the album like in \\"Toxicity\\" but when half the album is sung by him it's just too much. The instrumentalism is nearly the same, but it lacks the melodicness and disparate influences found on their previous albums. All this album has going for itself is its catchiness. But then again that isbecause they repeat everything a million times. Overall I wouldn't say it's horrible just poor compared to System's standards. Lets just hope \\"Hypnotize\\" will be better.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|As far as I'm concerned you are just unhappy folks with nothing better to do but slam a movie. Write a critique, not a slam.  Sheesh, if it was that bad for you why even write about it? Sure it wasn't \\"perfect\\" but what movie is?  Just give some decent critque of the movie with some good and bad.  Why even see something and then go on and on about how much you hate it? Move on.  There surely has to be something out there you like. And quit dissing on Keanu.  If you think he can't act, then stop watching his movies if you will continuously be disappointed.  I just don't understand people running around trying to find something to bitch about.  <br /> <br />But to just call something \\"stupid\\" and then go rambling on about how bad it was, why not instead ignore the movie and go and talk about some movies that you did like and recommend them?  I swear, such negativity.  I loved this movie and I've been waiting to order it. So, stupid or no, there are plenty of movies I haven't liked, but I don't go blasting them. ?? If it isn't constructive comments, but just out and out anger about a movie, seems to me there are bigger issues at hand. Anger management maybe needed for these types of individuals.  <br /> <br />If you don't like it, fine, but for pete's sake, go take a happy pill and watch something you do like.  <br /> <br />It's all good, dude.  There isn't a shortage of movies out there or anything.   <br /> <br />:-) <br /> <br />To each his/her own. Constantine was a creative, well acted piece of entertainment that was refreshing to view in this era of slap-happy campy remakes. It was nicely done, a breath of fresh air.  Reeves and Weisz, as well as the entire cast and crew put their all into this and for it to just be slammed out of hateful spiteful comments, that's just unecessary. I say again, go find something you do like, or be more respectful in criticizing something you don't. These whole movie review things have turned into slam fests and attacks on the creators behind the movie and I don't think that is entirely fair.  It takes much work and effort to put a movie together.  I've seen some movies I have absolutely hated but I don't go slamming everyone involved in them because you know, I couldn't do any better. Just be fair, sheesh. No movie is perfect, but just because there is so much negativity here lately, I'm five starring it.  <br /> <br />Peace out
0735619670|4.0|After read it from begining to end, I think that CC2 has suficient new information to invest in. Why? because like many programmers, sometimes unexperinced sometimes with too much experience, I saw how some errors come again and agin. Posibly CC2 is too closely related to a Style Guide of programming, however I've seen suficiently too much \\"artist\\" and \\"lone rider\\" in this area. <br />This a First to read book after knowing some language. If you want to arrive somewhere we need a little methodology (I'm sorry but we need it). Like CC2 i feel that a good aproach to project success is controling complexity. Don't miss to transform and simplify your design (not your code!!) to help to understand programmers and future designers.  <br />After it don't forget basic Patterns, and try to forget some miraculous solutions.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|This has to be one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen!!! Not only were the wires that moved the puppets visible but the words never even matched up with the mouth movement. The only reason I watched this crap was because it was so stupid, I couldn't turn it off. The only thing that Trey and that other dipstick got right, was the Portrayal of Hollywood's group of Anti-American losers. WASTE OF MONEY!!! WASTE OF A MOVIE!!!
B0006GAOBI|3.0|...with a certain style, but I find it indeed overrated in my opinion -I've seen far more entertaining \\"artistic\\" movies though perhaps never anything quite like \\"Donnie Darko\\" (and you may take that as a plus... I guess). It's somehow like watching a long music-video, and to be honest the music is what appealed most to me personally. There's nothing wrong with the acting, but nothing about this movie (including its' story) managed to engage me. I liked \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" better I think, and \\"Vanilla Sky\\" absolutely. But the movie only is entertaining to a certain level, though I wasn't exactly bored -I've even seen it twice to see if it would change my opinion, and to find out if there had been something I had missed at first view -but my first impression wasn't changed. Very b-movieish. <br /> <br />I don't quite get the \\"hype\\" about this one..?
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I'll say it up front - this performance wasn't quite Hell Freezes Over quality.  For that reason I would have rated this 4.5 stars; unfortunately, that's not an option.  Therefore, FIVE STARS will have to do.  Oh yes, I missed Felder's guitar work (nasty little lawsuit there), but Steward Smith fills in very nicely.  And, contrary to some reviewers, I liked how the horn section added a new layer to the groups sound.  I didn't find them intrusive at all.  All the guys were hitting their marks and really seemed to still enjoy what they were doing. These days, with so little out there in the way of new music for the slightly mature rock fan like myself, I'm very happy to have the opportunity to add this DVD to my concert collection. SIMPLY BRILLANT!
B000059XUT|1.0|The story and the meaning behind made sense, although it is an sad and some moments too cruel movie. look forward to next one, hope it becames more soft and loving
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|The new System of a Down cd is all the title promises and more; it is truly mesmerizing.  Mezmerize, released on May 17th is a beautiful masterpiece with a great mix of ballads, rock n' roll and metal.  Anyone with an adventurous mind should check out this cd.  Combined with fearless political opinions and heavy rock riffs, this is a must-own 6 months into the year.  The cd starts off with an intro leading into the recently popular single \\"B.Y.O.B.\\"  This song is a combination of heavy metal verses combined with one incredible chorus.  Don't underestimate the power of Daron Malakian and Serj Tankian's singing; both have talent equal to the greats of the day.  The cd continues with their great rock and singing in the next song \\"Revenga.\\"  This song has less-heavy metal rock and more of the incredibly talented singing.  The next great song on the cd is track 5 \\"Radio/Video,\\" which happens to be a slap in the face to the money-obsessed musicians, \\"Hey man look at me rockin' out/I'm on the radio.\\"  The song quickly transitions from criticism of greedy celebrities to Tankian's \\"la, la, la's\\" which are pleasing to the ear with the abstract and melodic music that accompanies it.  The band does a good job of illustrating their views in only a 38-minute cd.  Humor and sarcasm are eminent in the next two songs, \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\" and \\"Violent Pornography.\\"  \\"Violent Pornography\\" is a song that you can listen to and laugh with for hours.   The cd really hits it out of the park with the last four songs, which are combination of ballads and heavy rock; these are the kinds of songs people wait 30 minutes after a concert to hear in the encore.  \\"Question!\\" will surely be heard on the radio within a few days with its fast singing/talking vocals, which open the song complimented by an unexpected acoustic guitar.  It then transitions into a head-turning chorus containing fewer words and more guitar.  This is the \\"sleeper\\" track on this album for it isnot too metallic, and mixes in some of Daron Malakian's incredible guitar riffs.  The 10th and 11th Hollywood tracks really end the cd with a bang.  \\"Old School Hollywood\\" is the less impressive of the two songs, but still catchy and \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" will be a household favorite within weeks.  This is the best ballad on the cd as it really highlights Tankian's vocal ability and Malakian's musical skill.  The album does contain a two, not so catchy songs, \\"Cigaro,\\" track 4 and \\"Sad Statue,\\" track 9.  These songs are filler songs that contain bad lyrics and unnecessary rock.  Overall, these two tracks are the only two bad tracks on the album, with the other nine being of great talent.  So, if your not into the \\"I like my kind of music and nothing else\\" mentality, check this album out, download a song or two IF you need to get you in the mood, but definitely open your mind and check out the work of art that is \\"Mezmerize\\".
B000002L9J|5.0|These very words will resonate with me untill the day I die. You've heard the hype surrounding this record, frequently scoring places on \\"Greatest albums\\" lists the world over. You think that it really only got that way is because it's been said so many times, people are literally being conditioned to say so. So that is when you pick up \\"The Queen Is Dead\\", and that is the exact moment you understand exactly why it is such a highly rated piece of work. It is the album that the Smiths discovered new depth in their music. Far more colorful to listen to than the rather drab, black and white sounding debut, the Smiths work with alot of different musical textures to surprising effect. They do not sound bloated and bombastic, but at the same time, the arrangements are more layered and complex. They've pulled off perfect balance here, and they hit you with an incredibly stunning set of songs that traverse many different musical genres that flow almost perfectly together. The hardest rocking title track, The Queen Is Dead, is like a shotgun to your face the moment that bass and drum combo smashes into your speakers. Then bouncy pop of \\"Frankly Mr Shankly\\" and \\"Cemetry Gates\\", rampaging rockabilly of \\"Vicar In A Tutu\\", absolutely surreal lyrical nonsense with the brilliant \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\\", and the harder rocking \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\".  <br /> <br />But no fantastic album is without it's apexes. In the Queen Is Dead's case, there are two. Never before has Morrissey's vocals sounded so genuine and tortured as they do in the magnum opus that is \\"I Know It's Over\\". Geninune brooding angst in a song that will have you quivering. And finally, the godlike 'There Is A Light That Never Goes Out', you've heard about it, you've heard the pages of praise that this track generates, but now you can listen for yourself. It's brilliant, melancholic yearning.. \\"Take me out.. tonight.. where there's music and there's people who're young and alive..\\" the euphoria this track generates.. if there's a song I'd like to die in a car-crash while listening to, this one makes the grade. Wait for the melancholy flute (is it flute?) section at the very end of this song, as it climaxes toward a musical orgasm. Like Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", this track defines an era and at the same time, paints a new standard in excellence that no other band would ever hope to achieve.  <br /> <br />I never ever want to go home. If all that was playing on the car stereo was this song, I wouldn't either.
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|People like David P. Cole understand ZIP about Trek. Idiots like that should stick to Star Wars and leave Trek alone. His veiled knock on Kirk really got my ire up! Guinan never says it is \\"impossible\\" to go into the Nexus, and she warns Picard that if he does go in, that he will not want to come out. and his refrence to DS 9 is stupid at best. DS 9 was/is a great series. His childish panning of the apostrophies makes no sense. It is not the first usage of them. The Klingon \\"language\\" is chock full of them. His railing away at the fact that there are only 600 Ba'ku and that they should just be forced to have thier planet invaded by outsiders is again stupid. I could go on and on but to sum up, Cole and ignoramuses like him who really don't like or understand Trek should SHUT UP! about it. Cole and those like him should go see \\"Sith\\" for the 101st time!!!!!
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I think if this box set release proves anything, it's that nothing can diminish the astonishing achievement of Lucas' vision and determination in creating spellbinding adventures in other worlds.<br /><br />I first ran into Star Wars in 1977, when my dad took me on a holiday to California (we're from Australia) to Grauman's Chinese theatre to see this new \\"science fiction\\" film. I was seven years old and the experience literally changed my life. I now work as a director in television commercials and films in Australia, probably largely because of that day.<br /><br />By self description then, I am I guess, a 'classic' Star Wars fan.<br /><br />But do I believe in the originals over and above the new reworked special editions and amended DVD editions?<br />Well, frankly I'm divided... Let me tell you first, without hesitation, buy this collection - no amount of tweeking by Lucas can obscure what is, above all else a brilliantly constructed universe and epic narrative.<br /><br />I must say that even though I am highly critical of the prequel films, that fact that I had seen I, II and III added immensely to my enjoyment of watching the classic trilogy again. Knowing the background storyline somehow is a perverse thrill, as if you have power over these characters struggling to find meaning as they are thrown into peril and adventure!<br /><br />A few comments though on the experience of watching this trilogy evolve. Listening to Lucas on the commentary track (he participates on the audio commentaries for ALL of the films), Star Wars is like the most expensive, and detailed train set a Hollywood whiz kid ever conceived and he literally cannot keep his hands off it. An adjustment of colour here, an extra creature there, tweeked audio, enhanced skies. Some of the changes are very subtle, others are jarring. The general rule seems to be - if you don't notice it, it's good.<br /><br />For example, the cleaning up and enhanced shots in the battle for the Death Star in 'A New Hope' are brilliantly executed and seemless with the spirit and excitement of the original. To be honest, it's never looked so good. If all of the fixups had been this classy, I'd be ecstatic.<br /><br />The use of additional digital creatures in Mos Eisley on Tatooine is ill advised because it intrudes on the mood of the original film. Why does every new creature need to demonstrate some slapstick hijinks to make it's presence felt? Couldn't it simply form part of the backdrop as it would in reality? It's as if Lucas felt that, having spent money on the new creatures, they bloody better DO something to get noticed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many of the enhancements belie the problems with the prequels - and most of these problems are associated with story and character deficiencies.<br /><br />Han Solo's added conversation with Jabba in 'A New Hope' adds nothing whatsoever dramatically to the film and in fact holds it up, when the rampaging pace of the original film is what made it such a revelation at the time. Likewise Luke's catching up with an old buddy before getting into his x-wing for the Death Star battle is clunky and slow - that's why it was cut in the first place! Put it in the deleted scenes section for crying out loud!<br /><br />I am one of the reviewers who definitely DOES have a problem with Han Solo's scene with the bounty hunter which Lucas altered so that Solo shoots only after the Hunter's first shot. The fact that Solo beat the Bounty Hunter to the kill told us a lot about who he was (and don't forget this is the FIRST time you see him). He's a mercenary, not a girl scout who waits to be fired on. These touches are politically reactionary. No wonder Lucas struggles to create good characters now when he's afraid to give them light and shade.<br /><br />It has become obvious following the prequels that Solo is still THE most successful and popular character in all of the 6 films. why is this? It's his humanity and cynicism that holds the sympathy and amusement of the audience.  Lucas' fantasy world is so much more powerful because of the wisecracking disdain that Han Solo has for it. HE dominates his environment as a character unlike every protagonist in the prequels, most of whom are developed little more than Playstation characters, completely dwarfed by the special effect landscape.<br /><br />The prequels sadly lack characters with Han Solo's attitude. Ewan McGregor has a crack in ROTS but he's struggling against a witless script. Whack on Episode 4 and 5 and watch Harrison to see how it's done. It's impossible to take your eyes off him. Still, even in the classic trilogy, you could see Harrison Ford starting to look accutely embarassed by having to act against Ewoks and by that stage the acting and space opera whoops-a-daisy was starting to suffer drastically from a serious case of 'the cutes'. As you can probably tell, I'm not a huge fan of 'Return of the Jedi' - Ironically, being the most recent of the classic trilogy, it's also the most dated with an unhealthy reliance of eighties pop influenced music (especially the dire 'variety entertainment' scene in Jabba's palace at the beginning of the film (mystifyingly extended in the special edition), and also by the over reliance on Ewoks (clearly small people in relatively inexpressive furry suits). Still, despite it all, at it's best, for me ROTJ still betters 95% of the prequels - possibly ROTS outdoes it occassionally due to better plotting and vastly better special effects. The main cast from the classic films (Ford, Hammil, Fisher) can still act rings around anyone in the new films, especially in TESB, where they are at their dramatic and comedic peak.<br /><br />'A New Hope' and 'Empire' are simply magnificent on every level and 'Empire' has been far the best treated by any Lucas updates on this release. It looks absolutely breathtaking and Irvin Kirschner's direction is just the kind of planet hopping adult science fiction adventure that we all feel we have been promised, and, aside from Blade Runner and Alien, have never had since.<br /><br />So, for my money, Lucas has done enough to make this one of the most satisfying experiences you'll ever have with your DVD player. For consistency and attention to character and emotions, I think he has now been outdone by Peter Jackson and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but these films were here first, they changed the world and even made us feel that we had a new religion in a flagging spiritual era. For all of these reasons, I think Lucas has earned the right to keep playing with his train set as he sees fit. I'm still happy to watch on and enjoy.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning that the 150 min doco on the making of the films included in this set is absolutely wonderful, full of fascinating and frank details on the mountains Lucas had to move, both technological and political to make these films happen. Enjoy!f the wisecracking disdain that Han Solo has for it. HE dominates his environment as a character unlike every protagonist in the prequels, most of whom are developed little more than Playstation characters, completely dwarfed by the special effect landscape.    The prequels sadly lack characters with Han Solo's attitude. Ewan McGregor has a crack in ROTS but he's struggling against a witless script. Whack on Episode 4 and 5 and watch Harrison to see how it's done. It's impossible to take your eyes off him. Still, even in the classic trilogy, you could see Harrison Ford starting to look accutely embarassed by having to act against Ewoks and by that stage the acting and space opera whoops-a-daisy was starting to suffer drastically from a serious case of 'the cutes'. As you can probably tell, I'm not a huge fan of 'Return of the Jedi' - Ironically, being the most recent of the classic trilogy, it's also the most dated with an unhealthy reliance of eighties pop influenced music (especially the dire 'variety entertainment' scene in Jabba's palace at the beginning of the film (mystifyingly extended in the special edition), and also by the over reliance on Ewoks (clearly small people in relatively inexpressive furry suits). Still, despite it all, at it's best, for me ROTJ still betters 95% of the prequels - possibly ROTS outdoes it occassionally due to better plotting and vastly better special effects. The main cast from the classic films (Ford, Hammil, Fisher) can still act rings around anyone in the new films, especially in TESB, where they are at their dramatic and comedic peak.    'A New Hope' and 'Empire' are simply magnificent on every level and 'Empire' has been far the best treated by any Lucas updates on this release. It looks absolutely breathtaking and Irvin Kirschner's direction is just the kind of planet hopping adult science fiction adventure that we all feel we have been promised, and, aside from Blade Runner and Alien, have never had since.    So, for my money, Lucas has done enough to make this one of the most satisfying experiences you'll ever have with your DVD player. For consistency and attention to character and emotions, I think he has now been outdone by Peter Jackson and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but these films were here first, they changed the world and even made us feel that we had a new religion in a flagging spiritual era. For all of these reasons, I think Lucas has earned the right to keep playing with his train set as he sees fit. I'm still happy to watch on and enjoy.    It's worth mentioning that the 150 min doco on the making of the films included in this set is absolutely wonderful, full of fascinating and frank details on the mountains Lucas had to move, both technological and political to make these films happen. Enjoy!
B0000AUHQF|4.0|This is the best football movie of all time.  This is a deluxe edition that I just had to get.  22 something dollars was a lot of money though.  Rudy is the most inspirational movie that is in the sports genre.  Sean Astin does better in this than Lord of the Rings.  He should have got best actor for this one.  There is one dissapointing scene in this movie though and that is in the very end.  Rudy only gets to play for like five minutes.  Average sourround sound and a great picture.  It is really sad when Rudys brother dies.  I will have to admit I cried in this movie and guys do not cry in many movies.  It is just a great story and I think a greater story than Rocky, another sports film.  I do like Rocky though.  If you want to cry or just see a great dramatic sports movie than this is the movie for you.  God bless you and America.
B00005JLKB|5.0|In the start I was not sure if I would like it since it is not a whole lot like the comic book story with lex living in smallville and all, but I tell you what I think the story writers knew what they were doing all the way through.  I am a die hard lois and clark fan from the early 90's and did not think anything could replace it and it has not replaced it but equals it out quite well.  I can't get away from the show and always looking for smallville merchandise.  Recently, I purchased the season 1 pilot episode signed by all the characters (authentic) and several other things.  I hope this show last for a long time.
B0007MAO0M|5.0|Silverado is in my top ten for best westerns.  This movie had everything from gunfights, a draw, tumbleweeds, fistfights, adventure, romance,  and comedy.  I do not know how they managed to make such a grand western back in the eighties.  It took them a while for the two disc collectors edition but I think we are all glad it's finally here.   This is in my opinion Keven Costerners first relatively good film.  Lawrence Kasdan should have been called director of the year or something.  You shold buy this movie just because it is one of the best movies I have seen.   God bless you and have a great day
B00023GGFI|4.0|Granted, it is obvious that the guitar work here, is worthy of placement among the best blues records out there. But as always, Winters vocals range from the grating, to the almost comical charactures, they devolved into later(and not much later at that),in his career. <br /> <br />The guitar work deserves 6 stars, minus 2 for the vocals = 4.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie is one of the reasons why DVD players have eject buttons.
B00023BLXK|5.0|i love this movie, not only was diego luna soooooooo hot in the movie, it was a great love story. i did get mad that he falls in love with the girl though, it was obvious. overall i love the movie and it is in my dvd collection at home.
0553573411|5.0|It's books like this that make you wish there was a larger rating scale. Some fantasy books deserve 5 stars for fluid, imaginative writing and original ideas. The you reach Hobb and wish you could add an extra star in retrospect, because its the epitome of a storytelling experience.  <br /> <br />This book matches the first installment in the series very well. It doesnt lose steam like many series do by the second book, adding nonsense fillers and taking the story where it shouldn't because the author didn't have a 3-book installment planned from the beginning. Hobb doesn't have the most artistic writing style I've ever seen. It's not prone to lots of flourishes and flowery wording, but it is extremely solid and engrossing. Sometimes I can pick up her books and not be in the mood to start with her more subtle writing style; which sometimes takes recognition of her talent to see that the first few pages aren't boring, but perfectly developed, no more no less.  <br /> <br />Character development flows nicely, and none of the characters are superheros who can't get hurt and have endless powers. Everyone is human and everyone has their own process. The suspense in this story is great too, as 3/4 of the way through i was literally holding myself back from skimming to find out what was going to happen. The lines between good and bad can be sometimes blurred, with the reader never being quite sure who's helping Regal amount to his devious plotting.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for a synopsis you can find that on your own. What I offer is the assurance for a worthwhile fantasy, devoid of hackneyed genres and familiar pitfalls, that is neither overwhelming as sometimes can be, or too simplistic.  <br /> <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|I loved this movie! the movie was one of  my top five i cried so hard in this movie. it was such a greatly directed film. i went out today and bought the book. i have always heard the book is better than the movie. in this particular case i don't see how. this was such and emotional movie. the ending is sad yet wonderful at the same time. this is one of my most reccomended movies. if you watch it you are bound to love it!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|\\"Mesmerize\\" is a hook-laden album with all the right ingredients of band that dares to explore many musical landscapes to keep itself growing and interesting to its audience. After a few listens, I couldn't stop my brain from repeating all the catchy lines over and over again. I am now officially addicted to \\"Mesmerize\\". <br /> <br />Guitarist, Daron Malakian, takes greater control over the lyrics and singing on \\"Mesmerize\\", adding his pop sensibilities and ever-heavy riffs to give the album a different sound while still maintaining the SOAD signature sound. Serj fans need not despair; Serj still provides the majority of the vocals and does an incredible job at that.  <br /> <br />\\"Mezmerize\\" runs through the gamut of all emotions. You can expect the frantic, the melodic, the heavy, and the unpredictable all in the same song. It's hard to pin point the \\"best\\" songs because every song has something interesting to offer. If you like the single \\"B.Y.O.B.\\", you will like the rest of the album.  <br /> <br />I find myself disagreeing with some of SOAD's political views, but I can't help it; I like this band. SOAD deserves all the accolades for making music its priority in an age of teen idols and banal musicianship. I respect their conviction, musicianship, and experimentation.  In short, BUY THIS ALBUM! <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning is a lot like Kill 'Em All except the production is better, the lyrics are better, and I guess everything just got bumped up a notch. Fight Fire With Fire has a cool intro thats mellower, then it explodes. You could compare that with Battery on Puppets. The title track is a contender for the best on the cd. It starts fast and heavy and ends fast and heavy. Great lyrics and riff. For Whom the Bell Tolls is like Lightning in the fact it starts and ends perfectly. Another contender for the best. However, my favorite would probably have to be the instrumental, The Call of the Ktulu (Ktulu is just about the coolest thing ever find out about it) because of the atmosphere around it. When you hear it, it makes you want to go out and beat something to death. It's a powerful song. This was the last mark Dave Mustaine left on Metallica's work, Dave you did good with Ktulu. I would recommend this to anyone. GREAT CD GREAT SOUND GRAET LYRICS GREAT EVERYTHING BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!
B00004ZD69|4.0|The long band name, the long album title, the long tracks. This is not pop music by any stretch of the imagination. It is an acquired taste and the 30 second song samples provided here don't do it justice. So how do you describe it to people that haven't heard it? You can call it post-rock if you have to classify it (but not all post-rock was created equally). You can call it unusual (or as I called it- \\"not pop\\") but that doesn't help. To me, it's like classical music with long suites of music comprised of several distinct movements, only with a rock edge to it. This is music you feel, not sing along with.  <br /> <br />Lift Your Skinny Fists has 4 tracks - all near 20 minutes in length - three of which are the best stuff Godspeed You Black Emperor has offered to date. Tension is the keyword here. It builds and builds on an array of stringed instruments and percussion until its release is necessary to avoid breakdown. Then, after a lull comprised of droning noise and/or eccentric vocal samples, it builds again. <br /> <br />If you found this page, you're probably already curious about the group and/or this kind of music. I'd say give it a try. This is their most accessible album. If you don't like this, you weren't made for Godspeed.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This is the best cd I've bought all year. Metallica really had a good idea here. When I first saw this cd, I said \\"What the hell were they thinking?! Orchestra and heavy metal?!\\" But I found out some more about this cd and bought it. I still had doubts about my $25 being worht it, but when I popped it in my cd player all those doubts went away. Some people say the orchestra only mixes well with the older songs' sound (justice and before), but I completely disagree. The orchestra goes well with every song on either disc. The vocals are definitely different at first, especially in Of Wolf and Man and Nothing Else Matters, but that's not a bad thing if you're one of those people who hates LOAD and everything after it. The Memory Remains is twice as good as it is on RELOAD, and Fuel also sounds better. Hero of the Day and Until it Sleeps are actually high points on the cd, even though they still don't compare to Puppets or For Whom the Bell Tolls. I would say the worst songs are probably the ones off the Black Album. They're good they just take a while to get used to because the vocals are so different from the original. There are 2 new songs on this cd: No Leaf Clover, and Human. No Leaf Clover is one of the best songs on the album, while it took me a few times through the cd to appreciate Human. Battery is the closer, and I think it might even be better than the original. The only other comment I have to add is where is The Unforgiven? And you have to put something off Kill Em All, come on. But great work! Michael Kamen thanks, Metallica thanks, readers BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!!
B00005RJ1U|4.0|I recommend this movie instead of anything put out by Paris Hilton. It's a faced paced horror movie that has some very scary parts. Not for kids.The scariest, or most chilling is twards the begining when the brother and sister witness from their moving car the creature tossing bloody sheeted figures dowm a drain pipe. The creature notices them driving by and stops to stare back....The camera work is what made this scene perhaps one of the scariet scenes in recent history from HollyWood.
B000002HRE|4.0|This is not metal. This is hard rock. YES there is a difference. But I like the new sound. This cd has some good songs on it like Fuel, which starts fast and has some cool lyrics. The Memmory Remains is good too but not as good as Fuel. James' voice sounds higher at the beginning, it takes him a while to get in the groove, and it's not really set up to be a great vocal. And whats with the \\"na na na na na\\" THATS NOT JAMES!!!!!! The Unforgiven II is definitely the high point on this cd. Great lyrics and great tune. Follows up The Unforgiven I perfectly. Attitude is one of the heaviest thats another high point, and Devil's Dance isn't too bad. Overall, I think this cd is underrated and doesn't get the credit it deserves. If you don't like LOAD then you probably won't like this, but if you do like LOAD, then pick this up.
B000069HKH|5.0|`The rising' was inspired by the September 11 attacks and is a deeply personal, moving musical experience.<br /><br />There are typical Springsteen uptempo rockers like the jaunty, catchy `Further on (up the road)', `Waiting on a sunny day', `Countin' on a miracle', `Let's be friends (skin to skin)'<br /><br /> and a couple more, which are not directly linked to 911.<br /><br />`Worlds apart' stands out in its Arabic influences, telling the story of a cross cultural romance. A brilliant track.<br /><br />The title track is an anthemic rocker about regrouping, getting up again, coming back stronger. Almost a call to arms.<br /><br />Other standouts are `Nothing man', `Empty sky' (about looking into the NY skyline where the towers once stood and seeing nothing), and `My city of ruins' a moving ballad which has a gospel feel. Spiritual. Absolutely amazing!<br /><br />The highlight of the CD is also possibly the greatest song on loss ever released (You're missing) with poignant lines like `..too much room in my bed, too many phone calls... shirt's in the closet, shoes in the hall' describing the subtle signs reminding one of the reality of loss of a loved one. Beautiful! Even more meaningful to those of us who know someone missing from that fateful event.<br /><br />Carefully and masterfully written lyrics, coupled with Springsteen's passionate delivery make for one of the best CDs of 2002.
0375405380|5.0|Don Winslow's latest book (after _California Fire and Life_), _The Power of the Dog_, is an epic look at the US war on drugs from its earliest beginnings to more recent times.  The book is violent and thrilling and heart-breaking, as it follows a large cast of characters from the early 1970s through 2004, showing how the competing interests and agendas of various government agencies (the CIA, the DEA, etc.) get in the way of successfully combatting the problem, and often only served to make things much worse.<br /><br />Art Keller, the book's protagonist, is a half-Hispanic DEA agent who grew up in the San Diego barrio and saw the effects of drugs on his friends and family firsthand.  As a rookie agent, he makes the mistake of befriending Don Miguel Angel Barrera, one of the top Mexican policemen, in an effort to topple the reigning drug kingpin.  Barrera proceeds to move into the subsequent power vacuum and sets up La Federaccion, a much more well-organized and deadly organization than previously existed, and run by his two nephews, the intelligent and sensitive Adan, and the flashy and violent Raul.<br /><br />This sets in motion a 30-year vendetta on Keller's part, as he attempts to take down the Barreras and atone for his mistake, a vendetta that will lead to the deaths of numerous innocent parties along the way, and to Keller's estrangement from his own wife and children.<br /><br />The book was a very fast-moving, though extremely violent novel.  In a little over 500 pages, Winslow does an amazing job of encapsulating a lot of recent history, including the Camarena murder, the Iran-Contra scandal, and other related events, into a very readable and entertaining novel, one of the best I've read recently.  If you're not too squeamish, I'd highly recommend the book.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I loved `Basketcase' and `When I come around' from Dookie, Greenday's debut. Along the years, I heard the odd Greenday song. Then I got `American Idiot'.<br /><br />This is a CD full of energy, some rage and quite a bit of political lyrics too: the track `American idiot' is a declaration of independence from the perceived masses who blindly eat up government propaganda, all set to a furious drum beat and racing guitars, `Holiday' is a chant like rocker with an almost marching beat which features lyrics like `zieg heil to the president gasman, bombs away is your punishment, pulverize the Eiffel towers, who criticize your government'.<br /><br />That aside, what we have here is very good music. Clever lyrics, and great musicianship.<br /><br />There are some rock ballads like the absolutely beautiful `Boulevard of broken dreams' which has been a worldwide smash hit and `Give me novacaine', `Whatsername' (which talks about running into someone from way back, trying to remember her name and what could possibly be going on in her life since then) and the tender `Wake me up when September ends'.<br /><br />`She's a rebel' is an energetic punk rocker, reminiscent of their earlier sounds.<br /><br />Then there are the two very ambitious medleys: `Homecoming' which weaves through a medley of 5 songs, each great and diverse in style.<br /><br />Arguably the highlight of the disc is the other medley, `Jesus of surbubia'. Wow! Very hard to describe this song. Here again, Greenday take one through a variety of styles. Opening with the rocky `Jesus of surbubia', the downtempo `City of the damned', the pace picks up a bit with the rebellious sounding `I don't care', then drops for `Dearly beloved' which is a retro sounding number with great cooing backing vocals, then closing with `Tales of another broken home', another rousing rocker.<br /><br />A very ambitious CD which more than delivers. Not your usual boring top 40 fare.
B00006FDCD|1.0|Ok, get real. This movie is just as boring as the book. I'm a Stephen King fan, but It was just bad. Even the book couldn't keep my attention. After reading 200+ pages, I realized nothing happened and gave up. That's also how I felt about the movie. After the first four hours, you realize this is boring. And the ending, in the sewer? WOW, it was so bad, that I actually enjoyed it, because I got to laugh.
6305657947|5.0|Very well written. Very intelligent. Very funny. Great chemistry. Pierce Brosnan was born for this role. Though both main characters were quite sharp, I think Thomas Crown was the sharper of the two. He was always one step ahead of the game. This movie had my full attetion the whole time. There's not one boring part.
0800177177|1.0|I'm wondering if I saw the same movie as everyone else. I was forced by my girlfriend to watch this thing (still trying to figure out what I did) and while her taste in movies is notoriously bad it seems to be this film reaches new lows even by her standards. What amazes me is its credentials: Coppola, Ryder, Oldman? These are actual artists, so its baffling how they could have produced such a kitsch and pretentious piece of... work. The acting, except for Oldman, is seriously weak, dialog is ridiculous, Keen-o Reaves reaches new lows with an absurd \\"British\\" accent, sets are cartoonish (matte painting is especially amateurish), and overall it's just a huge bore. Gary Oldman, the one shining light in this travesty, looks like Angela Lansbury on a bad hair day. Ryder looks great, but what else is new? Certainly not enough to redeem this fiasco. The music is good, but if want to hear a soundtrack I'll turn on the stereo. After this ordeal I've decided to hide the DVD player.
0385338082|4.0|Heyyy this book was VERY good. I loved the use of detail, and Ms. Kinsella certainly made the book seem non-fictionus. It was an excellent sequal to \\"Confessions oF A Shopaholic\\" (another great read) and I will DEFINATELY be recommending it to all my friendss!!!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I am so thrilled with this album. I am the type of Mariah fan from her \\"Vision of Love\\" days and I am thrilled to say that this album is one of her best so far. Some of my favorite tracks are:    - I Wish You Knew: This is a wonderful ballad with a kicking beat.Mariah's voice is so sublime on this track. Makes me love my partner even more...    - Fly Like A Bird: Mariah always does a great job with an inspirational song...from \\"There's Got To Be A Way\\" to \\"Make it Happen\\", \\"Hero\\"...the list goes on and on..she is just a natural for these true-to-life songs.    - We Belong Together: Well, we all know this is a number one quality song. I just love it so much.     - Joyride: Such a fabulous song! From the start to the end I just  focus on the lyrics, the vocal style...very, very impressive.    - It's Like That: Very mellow. Just want to live and enjoy life!    - Stay The Night: Fabulous beat and lyrics.    In summary, Emancipation of Mimi is truly an excellent album and Mariah continues to touch that part of my musical heart that no one else could.
B000007T1M|4.0|System of a Down is one of the best bands ever, hands down. They are so incredibly strange, innovative, and musically talented that it repeatitively shocks me to no end. They have so far created four extraordinary albums, and this one is certainly a great start. While I have to say that this is probably my least favorite of their albums, it is definately a great cd, and is worth the buy. <br /> <br />1. Suite-Pee - A great song to start a great album. It starts off with some awesome guitar from Daron, and continues its fast pace for a while, with Serj eventually coming in with very fast-paced and enjoyable singing. Then it suddenly slows to almost nothing, and we hear some roar/screaming from Serj. After that, some small guitar solos, and some more verses, the outro comes, yelling, \\"The falling of Christ!\\" over and over again. An all around great song, with no downfalls whatsoever. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Know - The verses in this song are really enjoyable, due to Serj's voice and the fun, almost bouncy rhythm during them. The chorus is pretty good, with some nice roaring. It eventually breaks to a somewhat lengthy drum solo, and later Serj comes back in, before it repeats the chorus once more. A good song, but not one of the best. 8/10 <br /> <br />3. Sugar - Starts off nice, with Serj yelling about the Kombucha mushroom people. The verses are okay, but not that great, but the chorus is really nice, featuring the Kombucha mushroom people again, and some really nice sounding kind of grunts to say the 'who' in 'Who can believe you?' Later, Serj starts telling things about him going insane and killing everyone, and then a great outro with him repeating 'F*** you, it all goes away.' and 'In the end, it all goes away.', gradually getting faster and faster until it just suddenly stops. This would have been a bit better if it weren't for the verses being a tad bit obnoxious, but it's still very good overall. 8/10 <br /> <br />4. Suggestions - Starts off really nice (they really know how to start off their songs, huh?) Some really cool and bizarre vocals from Serj abound in this song, ranging from some regular singing, to a strange screech, to a very strange voice with the words 'The ships are multiplying day after day sir, and they're coming close to the shore, sir, shore, sir!' A very peculiar, yet enjoyable song. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Spiders - A truly great song. It starts off very slow and haunting, with emotional and bone-chilling vocals from Serj. The guitars keep coming in hard and then leaving suddenly throughout the song. Serj sings rather beautifully in much of the song, giving it just that much more punch. A wonderful and emotional song. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Ddevil - Very strange, and yet amusing. Serj does some interesting chirping kind of singing in parts of this song, and the lyrics are rather weird and random. It has a kind of bouncy feel for most of it, and is an all around great song, even if it doesn't make much sense. 9/10 <br /> <br />7. Soil - Try as I might, I just can't get myself to enjoy this song. Yes, Serj has some nice and ranging vocals yet again, but I just don't like it. This and Mind are the worst songs on the cd. 5/10 <br /> <br />8. War - A great song against war. Serj's vocals and the guitar meld perfectly together, to create a truly enjoyable song, even if he does repeat 'We will fight the heathens!' rather much. 9/10 <br /> <br />9. Mind - The worst song on the cd. I just don't see much to like in this, and it's far too long for it's own good. I suggest you just skip over it. 4/10 <br /> <br />10. Peephole - This starts off without almost any noise, but once the music really starts, it's nonstop greatness to the end. It has a creepy kind of carnival feel to it, that really adds to its mood. I love this song, even if it does repeat itself a whole lot. The break to guitar towards the end is really great, and the ending repeat of the chorus is amazing, with the drums changing to the upbeat, and Serj'svoice getting even stranger. A really great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />11. CUBErt - A very strange song, much like Ddevil in it's weirdness and shortness. The chorus is very weird lyrically, but fun to listen to. The lyrics don't make too much sense, but who cares? The song's great. Some weird kind of barking and such towards the end, and the last repeat of the chorus is really great. 10/10 <br /> <br />12. Darts - Very strange vocals, yet again. 'A hitman, a nun, lovers.' Strange, but fun. Lots of yelling/roaring/schreeching, and other strange noises. 8/10 <br /> <br />13. P.L.U.C.K. - Bizarre, as it goes from heavy, fast guitars, with screeching/yelling/roaring over it, to absolute silence over and over again. Really nice vocals and guitars though, and great lyrics. The harmony later on is really nice. Very powerful and fun to listen to; a great way to end the album. 10/10
B0006IUDXA|4.0|I'm glad MacGyver's on DVD at last. This season set is pretty good, except that the episodes aren't top quality transfers which is dissapointing. Also there is no stereo or surround sound soundtrack. Again dissapointing.  <br /> <br /> But the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars Is the lack of any kind of Bonus material whatsoever.  <br /> <br /> If anyone from Paramount is reading this Please put bonus features on future season sets.
0783114893|4.0|I bought this movie years ago. It is one of the best thrillers, period. Not just from the 80s. You may have noticed a lot of the 'scary movies' today suck. This one does not fit into that category. Frightening in parts. I will never forget the Finger!! That's all I will say, though. I DO NOT want to spoil the movie, though I don't think I could. It's so creepy you will be absorbed by the film and won't be thinking of any \\"spoilers' you may have read. ENJOY!
B0007Y4USW|3.0|I JUST BOUGHT THE NEW MARIAH CD, AND WAS SLIGHTLY DISSAPOINTED. HER VOICE IS BRILLIANT AS ALWAYS, THOUGH SHE DOES DO ALOT OF SCREAMING. THE ONLY TWO SONGS I LIKED ON THE ALBUM WERE \\"LIKE THAT\\" AND \\"WE BELONG TOGETHER\\". THE OTHER SONGS WERE OKAY, BUT NOT QUITE AS CATCHY. VERY STREET/HIP HOP. I WASN'T BLOWN AWAY; I FELT THE SONGS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, AND SHE COULD HAVE DONE LESS SCREAMING. SO, I BURNED THE TWO SONGS I LIKED AND GAVE THE CD TO MY FRIEND. I SHOULD'VE JUST PURCHASED THOSE TWO SONGS ON NAPSTER INSTEAD OF WASTING MONEY ON BUYING THE CD. MARIAH DOES LOOK GREAT THOUGH.
B00069L0XG|4.0|I feel that both of these films are somewhat underrated.  They were hurt by critics who sort of missed the point and by video gamers who expected them to be carbon-copies of the games.  They are, simply, very good zombie movies - lots of campy fun, great action, and even some genuine scares.  They're just fun to watch, and one of the big reasons for that is Milla - who looks great and is just perfect for this role, simultaneously strong and vulnerable.  (An earlier review said these were among her first films - in fact, she has been acting since 1991, when she famously appeared nude at age 14 in \\"Return to the Blue Lagoon\\".  She is a veteran actress with nearly 20 films to her credit.) <br /> <br />It is true that these films don't do much that's new with the genre - if that's what you're looking for, see \\"28 Days Later\\" instead.  But the Resident Evil films do the traditional zombie genre as well as any film has recently, with great special effects (these were big-budget films), good acting and a lot of action.
B000005H7D|5.0|The other reviewers may have a more nuanced perspective, but to an extent, putting this album into a proper historical context within a continuum of other quality albums, belittles the blindingly apparent fact that this is one of the most completely perfect album's ever to be released; One that you can veritably listen to on repeat.<br />It is upbeat and mellow, funky and classic.<br /><br />Listen to it 10 times in a row and it will be one of your favorites, if it isn't already.
0975991477|5.0|After reading the book you see the pieces of recent history of the medical field fall into place. It is amazing how intelligent men can become so stupid when they feel that their livlihood is some how threatened. The doctors of today with all of their fancy machines are still working in the dark ages when it comes to understanding how our bodies work. Even when confronted with results they revert to their learned dogma. <br /> <br />Then to see how he ties belief to healing and living a fuller life is remarkable.
B00003CWTI|5.0|OK, this movie has about a million reviews and analyses already, so I won't go into it.  This is in my top 5 favorite movies ever, and you learn all sorts of new, amazing things every time you watch it.  I just wanted to note that I went and saw the movie \\"Crash\\" this weekend in the theater, and it reminded me of Magnolia a great deal.  It was a wonderful film, making you think in the same ways that Magnolia does.  I recommend anyone that loves Magnolia to go see \\"Crash\\" as well.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This whole cd, and Green Day in general, are absolute garbage.  They sound just like every other \\"punk\\" (aka crap) band today and they can't even write a single decent song.  The lyrics are either corny (Boulevard of Broken Dreams) or stupid (American Idiot), as is the music as a whole.  I borrowed this cd from my uncle, and I was not impressed in the least bit.  I don't understand why these guys are popular at all.
055357342X|5.0|A friend of mine told me to pick up this series and I'm so incredibly glad I did.  I love all 3 but \\"A Storm of Swords\\" could be my favorite book I have ever read.  The character development is so amazing that you find yourself really liking characters that you hated in the first book or two, Tyrion and Jaime in particuarly. <br /> <br />I also love these books because they are not your typical, the hero always prevails stories.  When you first read \\"A Game of Thrones\\" it seems the story is all about the Starks but by the time you get to this book, it doesn't seem like that at all. <br /> <br />I recommend all three of these books to anyone who is a fan of the genre.  In my opinion they are just as good, if not better than \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" <br /> <br />I can't wait for \\"A Feast for Crows\\"
0312995423|2.0|It's possible Dan Brown knows something about cryptography and computing.  If so, he should have used that knowledge instead of cramming this book with endless errors and disinformation.  A catalog of the book's technical blunders would be nearly as long as the book itself. <br /> <br />It's possible Dan Brown knows how to write original prose.  If so, he should have done that instead of hacking together this pastiche of techno-thriller and romance novel. <br /> <br />And yet I kept turning the pages.  Maybe I'm a sucker for wanting to know how plots turn out or maybe -- but not very likely -- there's a little something here.
B00080Z53O|5.0|When I saw \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" after the Oscars, I thought that that was maybe \\"the best movie of the year\\". I say this becuase I think that not just because the academy gives that honor, it means that that's the best movie. \\"The sea inside\\" should have been at least nominated for best movie and Javier Bardem deserved a nomination because his work is flawless.  The story of this film is about the true story of Spaniard Ramn Sampedro, who fought for almost 30 years to die with dignity because he didn't want to live because after the accident that he had. He was postrated to a bed without being able to move his body. Along the story you will find another tragedy on someone very close to him. The female lawyer who was helping him also suffers from an illness and here's a point where she also wants to die. She was also the woman who helped him publish his book.  The story is amazing from the tragedy to Ramon's relationship with his family and a woman who falls in love with him and also helps him die . The actors work splendidly. Also Almenbar's work is fantastic (he's the director of \\"The others\\"). With \\"The sea inside\\" he won his first Oscar and his carreer is expanding very fast.  The DVD's speacial features include deleted scenes, a documentary, director's commentary, photo and set design galleries and theatrical trailer.  Don't miss the chance to see this movie. You will love it. It's very strong and intense but it's worth it.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Man, this is one of the worst albums I've heard since the last mainstream album I heard. The singer must have taken sucking classes at some terrible college because this man has sucking down to an art. I bet the bassist and drummer taught that class because those two are champions at that art. In fact, I bet that's how they all met and they decided to combine their powers to suck into one cohesive union of ultimate suck. On a side note, Yanni was teaching a class of awesome in another room at the college across the street. These guys released some albums before but their suck wasn't fine tuned yet. It's on this one that they really get together and come up with something truly terrible.
B0000D96NW|5.0|This is definitely the best MH album since Burn My Eyes. This is just as good, if not better. I hope anyone reading this got the chance to catch the States Turn Blue to Gray Tour with Devildriver (I didn't go because there wasn't a stop nearby, oh well). Every song on this album is perfect, I wouldn't change a thing. Some of the songs are driven by anger and agression, others by emotions beyond the usual metal scope. I never gave this album a listen after hearing The Burning Red, because I figured no one could come back from that. Machine Head has definitely proven me wrong. <br /> <br /> <br />Devildriver's new album The Fury Of Our Maker's Hand hits stores June 28th, I already have all the songs, and believe me when I say this is going to be Album of the Year.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|System of a Down is the kind of band that haters of linkin park flock to because they think their sound is original and that by listening to them, they're going against the grain. These sort of people are worse than those pretentious morons that listen to pretentious indie rocks and think they're being unique by not following popular trends. Well, you're better of listening to Linkin Park because there's the same amount of angst here although these guys seem to have stolen the sound of actual good bands like Estradasphere or In The Flesh and just added tons and tons of angst to the mix for fun because people like angst and they buy a lot of it.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Or for that matter prettier? <br /> <br />Yes, I'll admit flat out that I loathe all three of the new movies, but this isn't a forum to vocalize my disgust in character design, story, acting, visuals, etc. concerning those films. <br /> <br /> <br />And now, on to the meat of what's been done to the originals. The brightness is a problem, but that's already been addressed. As have the most of my other issues with the films. <br /> <br />In fact, the only reason I'm writing now is to argue that it still makes absolutely no sense for that boy to appear as the spirit of Anakin. <br /> <br />All right, so the original man was healed and an old version of himself. If you recall, Vader redeemed himself just before dying, thus making the leap back over to the good side ( and giving a reason for his ghost to exist along side Yoda and Obi-Wan in the first place ), meaning he was no longer a sith at the time of his death. That's only important if you listen to people who say he should be young again because he was only a sith after that point and his spirit wouldn't be a reflection of that. <br /> <br />The rest? They say that the actor lost the scars and if he was going to be healed up he should revert completely to the way he was before those wounds struck him. I'm not sure why. Obi-Wan was decapitated just prior to his death and he appears whole at the end of Return of the Jedi. <br /> <br />The only reason I have for Anakin appearing that way is because he wished to. I suppose I'd rather look like the young fop than that wrinkled oldie myself. <br /> <br />The rest, CG has never made anything prettier to me. Small touches, like CG rendered mobs or armies are endurable, but the unearthly architecture and critters of Star Wars and the like take me away from the film and remind me strongly of Final Fantasy video games. I'd rather we'd kept a more toned down simple look instead of oversaturating everything with \\"CG Prettiness\\". It doesn't steal my breath, it doesn't inspire awe, it just makes me think about a fellow with a gun/sword hybrid. <br /> <br />All and all? I guess it's worth having if only to avoid hooking up the VCR for a little Star Wars goodness. Still, I would have prefered the originals released to DVD at least in some way. <br /> <br />And yes, I know it's Lucas' film and his franchise, but that doesn't mean I have to like it, and I most certainly have the right to voice my opinions on it or any film in the form of a review.
B000683VI4|5.0|THIS is a great movie. A tear-jerker, to be sure, but a classic love story. You'll love it! I know I did.
0553573403|5.0|This book is not the prototypical fantasy novel, but it is the best. It has in heaps and droves what many lack: verisimilitude. There are paragons of virtue, but they are not immune to the plotting of the wicked. There are villains as foul as any laid down in any fiction, but many express virtues when least expected. You see many sides to the story, and see many viewpoints. You could easily sympathize with the villains, so human are their motivations.<br /><br />In grand style and sweeping vision comes A Game of Thrones, the first book of A Song of Ice and Fire. If you have ever read fantasy, this is the book against which all others will be measured. If you have not, then this is the book which will shatter the genre barrier. The story is riveting, the characters are complex and captivating. There is so much nobility, treachery, deceit, murder, and foreboding that it threatens to overwhelm, but that is the rollercoaster ride that Martin puts you on. By the end, you are virtually guaranteed to laugh, cry, and want to reach into the pages and strangle some of the characters, both good and evil, for the foolish mistakes they make or the wicked deeds they commit.<br /><br />This book is truly a once in a lifetime master work, not to be missed. The backdrop is a medieval setting that feels more historical than fantastic. Martin leaves powerful wizards and ancient magic orders to other novelists, and in its place gives you a realistic world that is at once both incredibly broad and amazingly detailed. But it is the characters that will have you wanting for more when the last page is turned, characters at once both noble and flawed, wise and foolish, evil but principled; never has a book characterized so many fascinating characters that all seemed so tangible.<br /><br />This book is a paragon of both art and artifice. It is well-written, to be sure: vividly imagined and artfully set to the page. Martin is a master of prose, and his style effortlessly flows from description to dialogue to flashback without ever wandering or wasting pages. But truly, it is the artifice that will capture you. There are so many plots and stories swirling about in this soup that it threatens to overwhelm the reader, but Martin steers you through adeptly, showing you many points of view, until both the characters and the story have truly come to life, which makes every victory and tragedy the characters experience your own to feel.<br /><br />You are forewarned: if you read this book, you will be swept away, and you will scarcely be able to put it down, nor any of its sequels, until you have devoured every morsel of this tasty literary meal.on to dialogue to flashback without ever wandering or wasting pages.

B00005UK1F|5.0|This album is not about breaking barriers and frontiers, its about blowing you away. It is indeed a masterpiece. Frmo where I stand, I say this because for the longest time I had wanted a metal album as complex as an opera, as just as chilling. And I found it, as this is my formal introduction to prog metal. Of course, I know I'll find other bands I'll probably like more, but at this moment, I doubt it. I know this band will stick with me for a long time. <br /> <br />The musicianship takes you on a trip, feeling the power of the unknown, and even pain. I felt it is a trip to the human mind, exploring the will of power. If there is a god, he definitely was inspired by this album when designing the human mind. <br /> <br />I see that many people are too concerned with cliches. Don't be. What i feel are cliches in metal, I heard none in this album, and if there are, who cares? Does everything need to blow the industry or the art away?
B000002BBY|4.0|I have never even heard one British band ever before, until Oasis's (What's Your Story) Morning Glory?, and loved it! My only problem with this album, and the reason why I rated this item 4 stars, instead of 5 is because the songs are kind of annoying after five minutes or so (every song is dreadfully long) and some get stuck in my head for as much as three days at a time!
0425170055|1.0|While my expectations were much higher for this book, I did get a good laugh at the end. Other than that, I wrote the story about 100 pages in, the political rambling on various topics got old really quick, and the perfection of the Rainbow group was boring. Also, I felt that the characters were never really developed. I'd skip this one and read Without Remorse instead.
0452285186|4.0|Andy Riley has definitely won his bragging rights, because the only time that I thought that commiting suicide was funny was when I sat down In my local bookstore and read The Book of Bunny Suicides! This is a laught-out-loud book that even has a sequel,called Return of The Bunny Suicides, but I would not spend eight bucks on a fifty (or so) page picture book.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I loved bowling for columbine, and I was aching to see this.  And I was very pleased by the movie.  Altho I seen some of it before, I'm just glad to see alot of facts I didn't know of until now.<br /><br />Michael Moore in this documentery definitly shows how the country changed after 9/11.  I mean people lived in fear, and all the facts in this movie show makes you wonder, how the bule motherfudge did Bush get re-elected?  I loved the way how he used the music and stuff, it really made you get quite a bit of comic humor out of it.  He made the truth stand out in any way you thought about it.  I thought it was pretty funny.  It's sad that I'm thinking of the goverment of the county that I'm in like that.(Or is it our president?  Man this film opened up too many conspiracy theories)<br /><br />I also read alot of reviews stating that this movie is crappy, Michael Moore is stupid, and that he used too much grief in this.  Well this movie is far from crappy, I mean in America today, people want to hear more stuff, and hearing stuff like this to take a turn from that same ol' stuff in the newspapers, it's just, we'll to me, and libaly many others saying, it's about time, and if Michael Moore is stupid, then why the fudge is he even doing a film?(Let alone get all these interesting facts)  Lemme guess, give a monkey a film, and he'll get rich eh?  And too much grief? look this war is REAL, the people dying are REAL. It's no fun and games; there's no joy in wars, even in pointless wars like this.<br /><br />Michael Moore definitly made a contraversial film here.  I mean I herd alot of my friends, and review boards(Including this one)have tons of opinions about this film.  Well, my entiere review states my opinion.  Those who like Michael Moore, and are tired of seeing the same crap on the news, check this out.<br /><br />peace
0345475674|5.0|Robert Harris has been one of my favorite authors for many years now since his groundbreaking Fatherland and the equally gripping Enigma and Archangel.  At first I was suprised to see Harris turn in the direction of First Century Roman Empire, but it turns out to be one of the best surprises of the year. <br />The novel reads very well, both informative and entertaining.  Harris does take some liberty with the events, but all in all they are true to the accounts of what actually happened.  The inclusion of Pliny the elder is truly great, since it is his accounts of what happened, that actually allow us a glimpse as to what it was really like. <br />As one would guess, the novel climaxes with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and like all truly great historical fictions, even though you know what is going to happen, you find yourself hoping that everyone will make it out alive.  That is the true sign of a great novel. <br />For those who want to learn a little, yet still enjoy a truly great story, this is certainly a book to pick up.
B00005K9LK|5.0|1982 was perhaps the key year for Judas Priest, as their biggest single, You've Got Another Thing Coming, was released on their ninth studio album, \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\". With this in mind, it is hard to believe that aforementioned chart-topper is actually one of the weaker songs on this classic stab of metal, which features some of the most memorable songs in all of Priest's catalog, including: <br /> <br />Screaming for Vengeance - pure speed! Halford's falsetto, and a killer solo break. <br /> <br />The Hellion/Electric Eye - the sing-a-long classic, the riffs on this song never get tired. <br /> <br />Devil's Child - the \\"AC/DC\\"-ish closer, showing that the band knows how to property execute a breakdown. <br /> <br />Fever - an underappreciated song, this ballad explodes at its climax. <br /> <br />Although the production is definitely a hindering factor in the quality of this album, there is no doubt in my mind that \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" is within my top three favourite albums from Judas Priest. The band has never sounded tighter, with the possible exception of the ridiculously-good \\"Painkiller\\". Even the lyrical content is better than on most Priest material, speaking of government oppression (Electric Eye), retribution (Screaming for Vengeance) and of course, women (Devil's Child, Fever, (Take These) Chains). A definitely must-have from the kings of metal.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Yeah, its me, (1 star dude) All is forgiven- life is too short- I'm glad you agree its not the best- But I was wrong- it IS still Dream Theater- all the 1 star reviews was just me pissed off- in actuallity it should be 3 or so- stars beside- DT is awesome! Take Care- see you on the Octavarium (sp?) review board- my hunch- It'll be a great CD, worthy of a few stars!!!
B000002J0B|5.0|I first heard Zepplin songs on the radio when i was in HS and they were awsome in contrast to the woosie eighties pop crap being played on other stations at that time.  It took me until 1995 to actually go out and buy my first albumn and this was it!  The best song on here IMHO is Dancing Days with the steady rythym of Bonham's drums and cymbol work reminding me of an engine and the odd organ synth thing JPJ was playing.  The lyrics honory as ever \\"you didn't tell her I had no car.\\"  Another picker upper is Over the Hills and Far away with great Page gitar work both aucoustic and electric.  The song remains the Same is also good, but Plant's voice is too muffled and is hardly heard until the end of it.  The Rain Song is a snoozer for some but it has a good melody.  The Crunge, well, It's The Crunge.  No Quarter is a bizaar vocal melody and slow steady rythm much like Pink Floyd's work when Roger Waters ran the show.  The Ocean is good in some parts and I guess is a tribute to some daughter/cousin of one of the band members.(I sincerely hope that's not her on the cover).
0930289455|3.0|Alan Moore's Batman: The Killing Joke is often considered one of the pinacles of Batman comics, ranking up there with Frank Miller's work on Dark Knight Returns and Year One.  While it is a fine graphic novel that gives one of Batman's most notorious villains a plausible and sympathetic backstory, I find that as a Batman story, it is sorely lacking. <br /> <br />The story revolves around the Joker, who has once again broken out of Arkham Asylum.  However, this time, instead of attempting to rob a bank or steal a priceless jem or anything like that, the Joker has a much more sinister mission in mind:  to prove that even the most sane men can be driven over the edge by causing Commissioner Gordon to go insane.  He leads the commissioner on a nightmarish journey into a world where nothing seems to make sense, including an attack on Barbara Gordon, also known as Batgirl, that will change her character forever.  All the while the Batman is working frantically to locate the Joker and bring him to justice. <br /> <br />However, the real story in the book occurs in flashbacks that tell how the Joker became a sinister, insane criminal.  He is portrayed sympathetically, and even his descent into crime seems to make a remarkable amount of sense.  It becomes apparant how the Joker was ultimately driven over the edge and became a disfigured, raving lunatic.  However, one thing to note is that this is only a possible origin of the Joker, so nothing is set in stone. <br /> <br />The artwork in the book is excellent and detailed.  It superbly sets the stage for a dark and brooding tale.  Even the flashbacks seem archaic and fitting.  All in all, it's some of the best artwork in a Batman book from the era it was written in. <br /> <br />However, what I find to be the ultimate failing of this books is the characterization, particularly that of Batman.  For years we have read stories about the grim and vengeful Dark Knight, an obsessive man dedicated to stopping evil that has a particular hatred of his mortal enemy, the Joker.  However, in this comic... we don't see that side of Batman at all.  From the very onset of the story, Batman is trying to talk to the Joker about helping to rehabilitate him, and even after the Joker performs several attrocities during the course of the story that by all means should fill Batman with a righteous fury, he sticks to this mission.  It seems incongruous with the Batman we know and love, especially when contrasted to how he reacted to the Joker's murder of Jason Todd.  Batman acts far too nice to the Joker in this story. <br /> <br />I also have to question the violence and 'mature' elements of this story.  While it makes sense that the Joker would employ appalling and uncomfortable methods for trying to drive Gordon insane, it almost seems like Moore was trying to see how far he could push things and what he could get away with.  A lot of what happens to the commissioner doesn't really add to the story, but seems to be there more for shock value. <br /> <br />And my last complaint with this story is the ending.  After this entire ordeal, with one character being seriously injured and another tortured, we get treated to one of the most out-of-character Batman moments in all of comics.  The ending just doesn't feel right at all, and the story could have ended several pages earlier and been much better. <br /> <br />In the end, the comic isn't bad at all.  It's a Joker story that adds a lot of potential depth to the character and changes some things in the Batman universe.  However, if you're looking for a good Batman story, this isn't a prime choice.  It's a good story to read once for the plot point that has an impact on the entire Batman universe, but otherwise, the comic just isn't entirely enjoyable or deep enough to pick up time and time again.
B00004W221|5.0|I generally don't like Sports Film but I am willing to make an exception. This film just shows that if you want something bad enough and are willing to pay the price. Then the world is yours! A great film about the human spirit!
B000000OAN|5.0|a night at the opera is queen's most popular album, maybe their best, others to consider are 'sheer heart attack' and 'queen2,' rock doesn't get any more original than this, the vocal arrangments are tremendous, great guitar work from brian may, brilliant song writing, from freddie's classic 'bo rap,' and the lovely 'love of my life,' and the lethal rock of 'death on two legs,' and brians 'prophet song.'  this is a true masterpiece that probably doesn't get the respect it should.
0783116934|5.0|This is a great film about the pursuit of one of the biggest mass murderers in history. That and how one man gets the job done inspite of the opposition of the Soviet Criminal System. <br />A great crime story that has been done right.

0156711427|1.0|As an Indian, born and brought up in India, this book appeared  <br />extremely shallow to me...the Indian characters are unbelievable and their descriptions highly biased..the portrayal of Hindus especially is highly ludicrous...also the story seems to indicate the superiorty of the British people throughout; even though Forster shows the British people in a poor light, he saves the day by making a martyr of Mrs Moore and Miss Questad... <br />Forster probably never went to India, nor did he really know any  <br />Indians, his novel is India seen through the eyes of a British  <br />Colonialist who \\"thought\\" he knew everything about India and Indians.  I am sorry for the people who think that this novel is <br />a true portrayal of anything that is remotely Indian.
B000069AUI|4.0|They're alrite i guess... i like a couple of coldplays songs. they are more different than other bands taking a more ballody side and i respect them for doing that. My mum doesnt like them and says they're songs can make you deppressed. Im always happy to hear them and i never get bored of their songs.A nd people who say Chris Martin is always constipated when he sings are just hopeless wannabe signers who secretly admire his amazing voice. His voice has got so much emotion and he signs his heart out. I loved a couple of their songs like \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Clocks\\" and \\"In My Place\\" are a bit different than their other songs and have more rythm to them. But my favourite Coldplay song of all time has to be \\"Yellow\\"! Its sooooo good. A lot different for Coldplay but still was great. Anyway there good but im not gettin a good impression on their newest song \\"Speed of Sound\\" and i think thats me off them for a while until they make more different songs like another Yellow. That one kicked ass! ;0
B00000HZFH|5.0|I recently got this CD from a friend, I had never heard of Built to Spill before. I always liked it, but with each listen I appreciate each individual song more. I wanted to see what other people thought about the CD and thats how I got here. I decided to comment because I want to tell everyone I can that this is an excellent CD. \\"Sidewalk\\", \\"Else\\", and \\"Broken Chairs\\" are my favorites on the cd and I will most definetly be buying another Built to Spill CD.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I was cringing at the empty headed lyrics on this CD.  Chris Martin obvioulsy has too much on his hands to spend some time on his end of the job, it's understandable - but just the same.<br /><br />Coldplay do ballads, and they do U2 songs.  The pumping bass and drums, delayed guitars and melodies that sound too familiar.  I suspect these guys cringe everytime they might have to bump into U2 socially \\"Hi, thanks Bono - the check's in the mail, mate.\\"
B00005JNBQ|3.0|In my opinion, this movie is WAAAAY overrated.  I rented it after hearing raving reviews of this movie, but I was only dissapointed.  Granted, I carried fairly high expectations from the geeky fawners of this movie.   <br /> <br />I heard this movie was about a boy struggling to be himself in a world full of the same.  When I watched, I found no evidence of the boy struggling at all.  Even if this wasn't the true plot of the story, the movie followed little plot at all.  There were a few funny parts in the movie, but none were wonderful enough to make me laugh out loud...and I laugh a lot! <br /> <br />Halfway through the movie, I became bored.  There was no substance to hang on to and the main character was too awkward and lost in his own world to even follow.  I couldn't figure out what he was thinking!  Did he like the make-up selling girl or did he not care about her at all?  I had a hard time finishing this movie and that hasn't happened since I saw Beethoven in the theatres. <br /> <br />If you are contemplating seeing this movie, I suggest you see Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.  It is a similar movie, but it has a bit more substance and better humour.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|The movie lampoons many supposedly taboo subjects: <br />- That anything is ok in the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. <br />- Liberal actors spouting nonsense. <br />- Michael Moore. <br />- Uber-patriotic redneck music. <br />- Failures of the US intelligence system. <br /> <br />Both sides of the political spectrum get the axe. <br /> <br />Mixed in with this, are several other funny scenes.  (Puppet sex that wouldn't be worthy of even a single X rating, Spoofs of Kill Bill and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the message would have fit better into an episode of South Park (home of the creators) as there were long waits between satiric spots.  It was as if there were the usual 22 minutes of comedy, but Hollywood required that the movie last as least 90 minutes.  That made for a painful wait.  When I find myself asking, \\"When will it be funny again?\\" that is a bad sign, despite the importance of the message.

Now you're wondering....was the wait worth it? it's Shakira trust me it was! <br />Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 - first part of the upcomming album in November Oral Fixation Vol. 2 - is what Shakira calls a musical cocktail, there is everything for everyone! from bossa nova for the Frank Sinatra fans to dance music for the Kylie Minogue fans! or even better rock for The Cure fans...its a cocktail of diferent style of music, but that's not what makes this album shines in the darkness of worthless popular music today....no! its the lyric, her voice, her power, her control with the music, its Shakira. <br />Now the review by song: -  <br /> <br />1. En Tus Pupilas - What a way to start this CD! The romantic rythim of this song is very \\"Shakira\\" very DELL. The lyric are as we all know AMAZING just as any Shakira lyric. ****1/2     <br />   <br />2. La Pared - Probably one or the best track of this album. You can feel Shakira's feeling in her voice, she transmit it with this song, specially the acoustic version. ***** <br /> <br />3. La Tortura - What can I say about this track? I think you all know it already, and it has made records on music and TV as being the first spanish song to be on MTV and other english music channels and getting so high on the Billboard Hot 100 (without counting Asereje or Macarena - 1 hit wonders - ). ***1/2 Also La Tortura is getting airplay WORLDWIDE, even Germany, Finland, Portugal, Latvia, Greece, ALL LATIN AMERICA,....all the world in other words with a SPANISH Song. <br /> <br />4. Obtener un Si - Frank Sinatra inspired Shakira while she was doing this song. The music is bossa nova and of course Shakira's voice, which is pure music. ****1/2     <br />      <br />5. Dia Especial - This track was written by Gustavo Cerati, and he is invited in the background chorus. AND....this is a classic, one of the best of this album. ****1/2 <br />         <br />6. Escondite Ingles - This song has some of The Cure and No Doubt feel on it, it is hard rock, with Shakira style. It is a favorite for sure. ****        <br /> <br />7. No - Second single of Fijacion Oral, what can we say about NO? it has Grammy all over it, the lyric, the music, this song is just AMAZING. *****   <br /> <br />8. Las de la Intuicin - Dance song, the \\"No Creo\\" song of the album or the \\"Ready for the good times(BETTER VERSION for sure)\\" of this album. It's fun and a song for the ladies for sure and another favorite for the mainstream audience. ***1/2 <br /> <br />9. Dia de Enero - For some this is the best track of this album, for others its almost the best track in this album! It's for sure a favorite! Here you can listen to Shakira girly voice, its amazing how Shakira can play with her voice. This track was written by Shakira to Antonio, its a funny,happy song deserves to be a single. ***** <br /> <br />10. Lo Imprescindible - Wow, is the first thing that came to my mind. You can feel the power of Shakira in this song! with a STRONG German intro the song gets your attention and in the chorus you can feel this mad, powerful Shakira. ***** <br /> <br />11. La Pared [Versisn Acustica] - I don't know which version I like more, original or acoustic, but this is a track that you will love even if you don't understand the language! Shakira's voice and a piano. ***** <br /> <br />12. La Tortura [Shaketon Remix] - Shaketon remix of La Tortura, every hot song deserves a remix! and trust me this is hot! **** <br /> <br />----- <br /> <br />Now my ranking of Shakira albums: <br />1. Donde Estan Los Ladrones? - Nothing can beat this, best latin album ever. <br />2. Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 <br />3. Mtv Unplugged <br />4. Pies Descalzos <br />5. Laundry Service <br />6. The Remixes.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Its got clear catchy good lyrics a nice beat to it and its really fast paced with every song! Whats not to like?? My personal favourites are Helena and I'm Not Okay! (To be honest thats the only two i've heard but im thinking of downloading other songs from them also!lol!). They're both so fast but somehow you can hear Gerads clear voice and it makes you just want to sing it over and over even if you dont like it! <br />I just started liking Im Not Okay when I heard it off a pal and he told me they had anohter song out at the time called Helena which in his opinion was better but I thought nothing could be as good as Im Not Okay! I was sadly mistaken. Helena is just as good as there first single but I still like they're wisper bit in Im Not Okay (Im ok, im ooOKAYY!!!). Its a real cool part! I cant wait for their next single cause I know without a doubt that i'll probally like it just as much as the last two i've heard and even if I dont the words will still be stuck in the back of my head! <br />  lml('')lml
B0006L16N8|5.0|I came of age in the 80's and have always viewed Coldplay as a logical extension of that sound.  I love New Order and Kraftwerk, so the influence there is music to my ears.  I have not found a group that carries this sound as Coldplay does so close to my heart.  I have been a fan since the beginning and I expect Coldplay to follow their own pace...and I will follow them.  I can't stand the pressure to \\"do something different.\\"  It is different.  The synth sound, etc is stronger, but I would not want it to be too \\"different\\" because I love the core Coldplay sound.  I know it stings them when they are criticized by the likes of Thom Yorke and his snotty self and it shouldn't.  They are not trying to \\"be\\" any other band, and Radiohead, though immensely talented has had a hard time reproducing something as good as The Bends. Yorke's attitude has started to turn me away from Radiohead anyway. I am pleased that Coldplay are SO consistently good. I love this album.  It enriches me.  \\"Talk\\" is my favorite song so far...but I love \\"White Shadows\\" and I also love the end of \\"Fix You.\\"  I do not find this album in the least disappointing.  On the contrary I just can't find a lot of fault with it.  People try so hard to find some sound that Coldplay fits into.  I have heard people say oh they are trying to sound like U2. I have been listening to U2 since the beginning as well, and although there is a distinctive UK sound to both, U2 has a unique sound and is instantly recognized as U2 no matter what experimental turn they have taken.  Anyone confusing the two needs to get their ears checked.  I believe Coldplay has their own unique instantly recognizable sound and in the age of 40 bands who all sound like variations of Lincoln park, I am just so grateful to have Coldplay.  I am not sorry for the wait...it was worth it.
B0002KVUKW|4.0|Showing you where I stand, Frank Langella will always be Dracula to me, and Laurence Olivier will always be Abraham Van Helsing to me. Also, so you know,this is not Dracula in the most traditional sense. If this is what you are looking for, then you are better off looking in the direction of Lugosi or Langella. All of that said, this is an excellent movie well worth watching. It pays tribute to the many horrors of the past. (Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolfman) It even starts by showing the first scene in black and white. (A nice tribute to the black and white era of horror movies.) While paying tribute to this time in the history of horror, the movie takes a closer look at the hero (Van Helsing). While Peter Cushing (Christopher Lee's enemy)  and Laurence Olivier (Frank Langella's enemy) handled the role of Van Helsing with style and charm, this movie explores the inner struggles of Van Helsing. This time, the hero is kind of an Indiana Jones type. (A basically good person who has faults and is willing to operate outside the law if he has to.) Van Helsing's allies are well placed. (The woman who carries a personality not so different from himself, and the side kick who is a little more innocent and nervous, but loyal and dedicated.) While many of us are used to the silent and frightening Frankenstein as portrayed in horror, the Frankenstein here is a little closer to the actual book. (Someone who is articulate and carries a deep sadness.) Dracula doesn't quite dominate the screen the way Frank Langella does, but again, this movie is more about Van Helsing. But Dracula does have an acceptable amount of screen time, and despite his evil, he has his charm. The scenery is not exactly up to Director Franco Zeffirelli, but it is memorable. I'm not one who really cares for special effects, but this is one rare case where the special effects flatter the events instead of distracting from them. I don't want to say too much and possibly ruin the movie for you, but they cleverly avoid the cliche happy ending. If you like this movie, I can suggest the following items as well. The book \\"Frankenstein\\" (1831) by Mary Shelley, the Lugosi version of \\"Dracula,\\" (1931), \\"Horror of Dracula,\\" (1958), and Frank Langella's \\"Dracula\\" (1979).ly avoid the cliche happy ending. If you like this movie, I can suggest the following items as well. The book \\"Frankenstein\\" (1831) by Mary Shelley, the Lugosi version of \\"Dracula,\\" (1931), \\"Horror of Dracula,\\" (1958), and Frank Langella's \\"Dracula\\" (1979).
B0006L16N8|5.0|Parachutes was good; A Rush of Blood was great; X & Y is not nessecarily better than A RUSH, yet it is an amazing strong follow up.  While there is no drastic progression from the songwriting formula of the previous two albums, the songs are so good that you can forgive this.  The one major change that can be noted is a greater dependence on guitar and synth effects, echoing the great bands of the early 80s such as the Cure and U2.  To produce an album just as strong as A RUSH is a testament to the band's songwriting ability.  The main standout tracks for me are WHAT IF (a great piano ballad), WHITE SHADOWS (a very energetic DAYLIGHT-style track) and A MESSAGE (a little like shiver off parachutes).  However songs such as Fix You, Low Square One are also fantastic; if you were skeptical after hearing the disappointing first single Speed of Sound, don't be.  The remainder of X and Y is as strong an album as Coldplay has ever produced.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Just bought OCTaVaRIUM, and I have to say \\"INCREDIBLE\\"! DT is without a doubt one of the greatest bands ever. I went in expecting an incredible piece of musicianship- it's what it delivered. I've been a devoted fan of DT since day one, and I can say they've never disappointed. DT is light years ahead of their time- keep up the great work!!!!  <br /> <br />Brian  <br />Philadelphia, PA
B00005QFE5|5.0|I rented this movie after reading rave reviews about it. The movie begins as a black and white movie and then goes back into color in flashback. Its about a son who is visiting his village after his father has died and discovers the reason why his mother wants to have an elaborate funeral for his father. An utterly romantic movie by Zhang Yimou set up in a snowy countryside in China. Definitely worth watching.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|...and even I think this is a huge downgrade from their previous work... <br /> <br />I'm sure everyone has been anticipating this CD ever since hearing Waking the Fallen.  Let me just say that you might want to wait for a future release instead of going out and buying this one. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />They just sound different (and not for the better).  I don't know if it's due to the major label release and the overproduction of the album, or if it's due to M.Shadows not being able to scream anymore.  Either way, they just sound a little more...dare I say it...\\"poppy\\".  If you're a fan of guitar solos you will love this album there seem to be about 4 in every song...no exaggeration.  Now I love guitar solos as much as the next guy, but sometimes it can be overkill.  You think that the song is about to end and then they go into a 45 second solo and it just isn't necessary.  Not one track on the album is under 5 minutes which is due to the unnecessary \\"filler\\".  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />I don't even want to talk about how bad the ballads are...but I will.  On Waking the Fallen, the ballads had some heaviness in them, but here there really doesn't seem to be much of a redeeming factor.  I would suggest just skipping over track 6 (Seize the Day) altogether unless you want to hear a neutered M. Shadows singing about living life to the fullest...Isn't this the band that used to sing about dead mothers...where's the darkness in the songs?   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Now don't think that every song on this cd is horrible.  \\"Burn it Down\\", \\"Bat Country\\" and \\"Trashed and Scattered\\" are high energy songs that have a good beat and sound and just the right amount of guitar solos... I think these only have about 2 each...  I would compare these tracks closer to punk rock songs if it wasn't for the length of them...  Oh and listen to the chorus in Trashed and Scattered...I swear that they dubbed Velvet Revolver!  It sounds just like them...Nothing against VR, but if I want to hear their music I would insert their cd, not City of Evil.    <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />So overall, if you go into this cd expecting to hear an improvement over Waking the Fallen, be prepared for a huge disappointment.  I'm sure Ill be listening to this cd a few times in the future and it will start to grow on me, but it will never get me pumped up like their earlier cds did...And watch out for track 6!!!  Just skip over Seize the Day!  Im listening to it now and now it's starting to sound like a GNR ballad...I'm going to vomit... <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Let's just hope that on the next album M. Shadow's voice is back to 100% and he can scream like he used to and give this band a little edge. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />One final note- Hey Avenged Sevenfold!  Santana called and they want their sound back on the track, \\"Sidewinder\\".  I was waiting for Rob Thomas to come in out of nowhere for a duet... <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|1.0|the hype surrounding this album is exactly like be here now by oasis....the guy who posted that is spot on, i thought it myself earlier today.  this coldplay album is perhaps the most boring stinkbag of an album i've heard in a long time.  i love the first 2 albums dearly, but this album drags, it doesn't compare with their own stuff and with other albums released recently (new albums by oasis, white stripes, stereophonics, doves, arcade fire, bright eyes - all great albums released in the last few months)  i'm hugely disappointed...but what can you expect, hype dies and talent dwindles, they have to rejuvenate themselves somehow, and should have had the balls to try something different.  through this whole album i found myself desparately waiting for the songs to end in the hopes that the next would be better...and not as long and drawn out....this album blows, except for about 3 songs.
B000002KE2|5.0|The 'problem' with several of the 'Classic' Black Sabbath album's is that you can't just play them, you have to LISTEN to them.. You can play albums such as Masters of Reality, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and Never Say Die, while doing almost anything.<br /><br />For albums such as Black Sabbath, Paranoid, Volume 4, and to some extent Sabotage, you have to just put down what you're doing, throw on a pair of head phones and listen.. What makes this album so great is that is it is Heavy without being Loud or Fast, and this is due to the foundation laid by Geezer Butler's Bass.<br /><br />On Vol 4, Geezer once again demonstrates that he is one of the greatest bass players of all time. Bill Ward is awesome on drums, and Ozzy and Iommi are... well they're Ozzy and Iommi...<br /><br />Many reviewers rate the individual songs on this album.. You can't look at this album as a bunch of songs... While each is unique, they all connect.<br /><br />Some one wrote that FX was a bunch of weird tapping noises.. Listen to it with head phones.. You don't need to be high, this will do it for you...<br /><br />So do yourself a favor, if you don't already own this, run out and buy it.. Go home, put on your head phones, turn out the lights, and press play... I promise you won't be disappointed..<br /><br />Other 'must have' albums in my collection... The first seven Sabbath Albums, the first 2 Def Leppard albums, the first 2 Maiden Albums, every Scorpion Album up to and including Black Out, Metallica's KILL 'EM All, Anthrax's Fistful of Metal, Judas Priest anything prior to Screaming for Vengence...  Nazareth's Hair of the Dog, and Razamanaz,  Riot's (NOT QUIET RIOT) Fire Down Under,(probably the GREATEST HARD ROCK album ever released) anything by Stabbing Westward (some of the greatest lyrics ever incorporated in to songs), and finally anything by Tool and A perfect Circle (thank goodness someone is still making great music).
B000089RVX|5.0|Even after three years of owning this cd, I still listen to it time and time again! <br /> <br />When I first bought it, none of the songs really appealed to me yet as I kept listening, I began to fall in love with every single one of them. Its hard to find a cd these days that you can listen to straight through and not complain about one of the songs and this cd does just that. <br /> <br />Amy Lee's vocals are amazing and she really has the talent for this business. The band wrote every song on the cd which is amazing because each song has a different style. The lyrics are so powerful and moving as are the instrumentals.  <br /> <br />No matter what mood you may be in, this cd can apply to it; wheather your are sad, happy, angry, upset, crazy- it can all work. The lyrics are truely poetry with music; it has a rock style with a dark edge. This cd is one of the best ive bought in many years.
B00025ETIW|4.0|This band is phenomenal... I was getting tired of the same old emo plugging up the radio waves. Finally, there is a good emo band. Gerard Way, the singer, has a voice that really stands out from all the rest of the high, nasal, stereotypical emo voices. A lot of people have been mentioning the great guitar solos, but I think it's the drums that really make the songs work. Just listen to \\"Helena\\"... I really like the percussion in that song. I gave the album only four stars because a few songs sound similar to each other. But overall, this is just a very good band.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I gotta say that ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' is Mariah Carey's best album in many years. I can listen to it from beginning to end without skipping any tracks , which to me signifies a great album. I am glad that she has come back singing like she used to , i was dissapointed with her \\"Charmbracelet'' cd because she was practically whispering on all the tracks and everyone knows that she has an amazing voice and i for one am impressed that on ''The Emancipation of Mimi'' she showcases her vocal talent. Having said that , i am also glad that she doesnt over do it by singing in that very high pitch she is capable of doing. Anyway , onto reviewing the tracks. ''It's like that''is the first track and single of the album and is pretty much a great club song. It's beat is infectious and the song itself is lighthearted and fun , and it succeeded in getting Mariah noticed again , ensuring her a place in the top 10 here in Australia.  <br />''We belong together'' is my favourite track on this album and its a beautiful ballad where Mariah successfully conveys her feelings over lost love. Its her 16th number 1 hit in the U.S and keeps her as the most successful female vocalist ever. <br />''Shake it off'' is a mid tempo song which is catchy with a heavy r'n'b vibe , whilst ''Mine again'' is another ballad that showcases Mariah's vocals beautifully on the chorus. <br />''Say somethin'' is the much talked about collabo with Snoop and the Neptunes , and its a breezy party track with Pharrel & Chad's signature sound. ''Stay the night'' is my 2nd favourite track and another that proves how talented Mariah Carey really is and how untalented most of today's current singers are. She can hit the high notes with ease and Kanye West's beat is refreshing alongside Mariah's vocals. <br />''Get your number'' features Jermaine Dupri and i gotta admit that his ''singing''?? is kinda annoying because he sounds like Nelly. Nevertheless , i like this track alot and i actually heard it the othernight at the club , it was great! A cool party track to dance to in my opinion. <br />''One and only'' featuring Twista is a great collabo , Twista actually gets to showcase his great flow alongside Mariah's sultry vocals. <br />''Circles'' is a cool track that demonstrates the return of ''the voice''exceptionally , and ''Your Girl'' is Mariah singing to her desired love about why she should be his. Its a cute track. ''I wish you knew'' is another great ballad that has a ''live'' feel to it and '' To the floor'' sees Mariah collaborating with Nelly on another club friendly track with  a Neptunes beat. However , i wish that Nelly rapped on it instead of singing because he clearly isnt very good at it. The album draws to a close with the lush ''Joyride'' and the incredible ''Fly like a bird''. The former is a wonderful ballad whilst the latter is an amazing gospel track that shows everyone why Mariah Carey is a singer that deserves the respect and recognition that anyone who recognises talent has given her. <br />In the end , regardless of how much she resembles Beyonce on the cover or how various fans claim to like her 90's works better , the latest album from Mariah Carey is a great purchase. Strongly recommended.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Wow! You know you've got something amazing when you release 3 albums that are ALL amazing, 100% of the time. Not one song I've heard from Coldplay that I don't love. From \\"Yellow\\" to \\"Clocks\\" to \\"Speed of Sound\\"--I love it all. They've kept a consistant sound while changing constantly! How do they do that??  <br /> <br />If you don't have this album, go out right now and buy it!! You WILL NOT be sorry.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I am a huge DT fan, I have seen them from their IAW days (and my old band opened for them for their \\"Awake\\" tour), but this CD left me wanting.<br /><br />More guitar riffs.<br /><br />More good vocal lines (with less processing).<br /><br />More DT.<br /><br />Less keyboards.<br /><br />Sorry, but ever since Kevin Moore left, the real sound of DT has suffered. While I loves Scenes, a great concept and a great tour, I just cannot get into Jordan. He plays too much from his head and not enough from his heart, something Kevin did effortlessly. A single listen to IAW and you'll hear more passion and more complementary keys. Not just showing you have chops (which Jordan has PLENTY of-the man can really play well, but his heart isn't there like Kevin's was).<br /><br />Sorry guys, I cannot get behind this one like I could the other ones.<br /><br />Go back to the old days when you wrote melodies and really parted your songs out in ways that fit. One listen to TOT and this new one and you'll see who's in charge, the FNG.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I can't possibly think of a way that Coldplay could make a bad album, based on the standards that they have developed from their previous \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". \\"X & Y\\" in my opinion exceeds 'Rush of Blood' with its starry, imaginable lyrics, and wonderful harmonies (that's not to say that 'Rush of Blood' doesn't have those; it's still fantastic!). However, I think 'Parachutes' is their greatest work. The first time I listened to 'X & Y', it just sounded like a blur of Coldplay, I couldn't tell any difference between one song and another (besides the single Speed of Sound), but when I listened to it a few more times, it really started to sink in and I could notice details that made that song unique. For instance, although 'What If' sounds like 'Everything's Not Lost' a bit, it picks up and goes into one of the greatest Coldplay songs ever. I still don't really understand the lyrics to 'Speed of Sound' after listening to it countless times. Something about birds flying at the speed of sound from the underground, I don't know. 'White Shadows', just beautiful. Chris Martin sings it so well. What am I saying? He sings every song well! The Hardest Part strangely is a bit reminiscent of Simon and Garfunkel's \\"Sounds of Silence\\" for some reason. Just the way it sounds.... The little riff in 'Talk' got really stuck in my head when I first started listening to it; awesome song. The worst on the album (but remember it's not bad) would have to be 'Twisted Logic'. I guess it's not that bad, but I'd rather listen to Radiohead's 'My Iron Lung'. As a bigger Radiohead fan that Coldplay, these songs are so similar, except this one doesn't have Thom Yorke's screaming. The diminished chords repeated over and over in the song really remind me of the beginning of 'My Iron Lung', as well as the middle parts sound just like it. Great ending for the album, wants to make me go listen to Radiohead.  Fine, the worst song, but also not bad, would have to be the bonus track, ' 'Til Kingdom Come'. Martin sounds like he has a stuffy nose. I'm also not a big fan of the acoustic stuff, but I like the synth. But it's still a nice song, and I'm glad it's a bonus track and not interweaved in the album.  <br /> <br />Square One - *** (out of ****) <br />What If - **** <br />White Shadows - **** <br />Fix You - ***1/2 <br />Talk - ***1/2 <br />X & Y - *** <br />Speed of Sound - **** <br />A Message - ***1/2 <br />Low - *** <br />The Hardest Part - ***1/2 <br />Swallowed by the Sea - ***1/2 <br />Twisted Logic - *** <br />'Til Kingdom Come - *** <br />Overall - ****  <br /> <br />With a lot of bands without a reputation, you can judge what their album will be like by listening to the single. If it's good there will probably be only one or two good songs. But a band with a good reputation...when I heard 'Speed of Sound', the album's first single, I knew that it would be nearly impossible for 'X & Y' to go wrong.  <br /> <br />As I am writing this, I just looked at Audioscrobbler to see that most of 'X & Y' has climbed to the top! Take that Mezmerize (also a great album)!
B00002ND77|5.0|This movie is obviously about the life of Malcolm X.  Denzyl Washington's performance is comparable to Fox's in \\"Ray\\" so what happened?

B00015YVD6|5.0|Tom Hanks had done a couple of TV shows and the producers of \\"Splash\\" really wanted a bigger name actor in their movie.  Daryl Hannah had made a favorable impression in a bit part in \\"Blade Runner\\" but the big \\"name\\" in the announced cast of Splash was John Candy, who was probably paid as much as the rest of the cast combined in the role of brother Freddy.<br /><br />It would have been very easy for the movie to become a broad farce with Candy and Eugene Levy in the love story of the man and the mermaid, but writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel found the right note between love story and comedy, and the cast pulls off both.  The comedy varies between clever and slapstick, and seeing the film again 20 years later still made me laugh at parts.  As expected, Candy and Levy do the heavy lifting in the comedy department, and they are both hilarious in their respective scenes.  The whole movie wouldn't work at all, though, if we didn't believe in the central love story - and Hanks and Hannah make it work.<br /><br />Hannah is a mermaid apparently not unlike Disney's Ariel.  She has a tail when wet, and legs when dry.  Hanks is Allen Bauer, who has inherited his father's wholesale produce business along with brother Freddy.  As a child Allen suddenly jumped into the water off Cape Cod, where the child mermaid rescues him until the adults can fetch him from the water.<br /><br />As an adult Allen has commitment issues and admits he doesn't love his girlfriend.  After a friend's wedding he returns to Cape Cod for a little nostalgia.  Another boating accident results in another mermaid rescue, but the \\"girl\\" runs away as Allen regains consciousness on shore.<br /><br />The mermaid fetches Allen's wallet from the ocean floor and follows a map to track Allen down in New York City.  She climbs onto dry land at the statue of liberty - lacking a tail and clothes - and is taken into custody by the police.  They call the guy who owns the wallet she's carrying.  (The mermaid, of course, can't speak English...)<br /><br />So Allen and the Mermaid are united again, where the attraction is powerful and mutual.  The Mermaid learns English watching television for an afternoon (this makes the rest of the movie easier!) and she decides to make her American name \\"Madison\\" while looking at a street sign for Madison Avenue.  (Many Americans subsequently chose \\"Madison\\" for their daughters after this movie.)<br /><br />Allen only knows Madison is \\"foreign\\".  Madison's time on land is limited.  (For reasons that aren't exposed in the film.) Levy portrays a renegade pseudo-scientist who has been searching for a mermaid his entire career.  When one swims past while he's diving at Cape Cod he is startled.  Then he sees a newspaper photo of a nude girl at the Statue of Liberty that looks a lot like the mermaid...<br /><br />The plot isn't difficult to guess, but the performances are full of funny and touching flourishes that make you laugh and care about these characters.  This isn't really a 5-star movie - but I couldn't choose 4 1/2.  It's a pleasant way to spend some time with your own sweetie.So Allen and the Mermaid are united again, where the attraction is powerful and mutual.

When one swims past while he's diving at Cape Cod he is startled.  Then he sees a newspaper photo of a nude girl at the Statue of Liberty that looks a lot like the mermaid...    The plot isn't difficult to guess, but the performances are full of funny and touching flourishes that make you laugh and care about these characters.  This isn't really a 5-star movie - but I couldn't choose 4 1/2.  It's a pleasant way to spend some time with your own sweetie.
B0006L16N8|5.0|simply put, Coldplay keeps it real... this is a band that evolves without trying to reinvent itself, and the results are captivating... also, as i try to find themes with most albums, this one evokes a sense of old U2 here and there, and i love that feeling...There is definitely a U2 quality (which I have noticed before) in \\"Square One\\".  I also notice some sounds that remind me of the album \\"Synchronicity\\" from The Police... anyway...  I really like \\"White Shadows\\" although it ends in an odd fashion for me;  also, I think \\"Fix You\\" will be on the radio at some point, perhaps even with a  modified `radio mix' to speed up the beginning, but the chorus and up tempo ending are classic Coldplay-I can't wait to play the last 1.5min of that song REALLY loud.  \\"Talk\\" is maybe my least favorite of my first few listens, and while catchy, the way the guitar melody echoes the lyrics is actually a bit annoying for me.  I've never heard any Beatles/Oasis-like stuff from them, but I did in \\"X & Y\\", and by the way, this is a fabulous love song-but I don't think it is number one radio chart material (loved the violin finish by the way).  What can I say, \\"Speed of Sound\\" is a great song.  The piano riff of \\"Clocks\\" and the wandering melody of \\"Yellow\\", I like it more with each listen.  (side note, I would really love Chris to put out a piano only album).  \\"A Message\\" is a really nice song, and perhaps the song that would most easily fit on one of the first two albums.  This song could also be the next single.  An interesting guitar riff about 2/3rds of the way through the song brings that early U2 sound back a bit too, and definitely cements this album as more flowery than A Rush of Blood... <br />\\"Low\\" now this is a great song, but again, I am struck that this should be Bono singing-but don't get me wrong, I think U2 is one of the best rock bands of any era, and I don't think Coldplay is copying them, I just think a lot of what pulls me toward each is a similar quality of guitar and vocals-and actually leaves me wanting a bit more of the piano on this album.  \\"The Hardest Part\\" gets my vote for biggest chart topper, which only means I think it is a song my mom would like.  Something about the arrangement reminds me of songs I have heard before, which isn't a bad thing with Chris at the helm, and it does have the piano I like.  \\"Swallowed by the Sea\\" is indeed a lullaby, and showcases what the world loves about Chris' voice (I think he and Dave Matthews should do a duet).  This one reminds me a bit of \\"In My Place\\"-I can't wait to learn the words to this one so I can belt it out in the shower, and I think this too would have been a solid as a their first single; it seems like a holdover from the Parachutes album.  I like this song a lot.  Finally, \\"Twisted Logic\\" is really fun, and I think this song will wear out the volume button as you can't not turn it up at the chorus, and the up and down tempo makes me want to sway.  Also, I like his voice on this song best, really shows his low and high range without seeming gimmicky, while the guitar is actually a bit more Beatles-esque again, and less The Edge.  Also, a great song and I really hope they play this in concert as I can't wait to hear it after one too many beers.  The hidden track is just that, hidden and is a nice addition to round out this album.  On the whole, this is a wonderful album, and maybe it is just me, but there is a softer edge (i used the word flowery above) that maybe is a result of band maturity, or fatherhood.  But the gorgeous layers of sound that result are delightful. <br /> <br />
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This film was absolutely flawless! Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet deliver breathtaking performances with a great supporting cast including Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie. Finding Neverland perfectly creates the inspiration that lead J.M. Barrie to write the beloved \\"Peter Pan\\" and has the situation with the family mirror what Barrie writes in the play.  <br />It also does an excellent job of merging fantasy and reality in many scenes, and it gives even adults that suspension of disbelief, that feeling of letting the imagination take flight, with no inhibitions whatsoever. <br />This movie deserved an Oscar! <br />Bravo!
B00005JO9J|5.0|When I first heard about Grey's Anatomy I thought this would be another boring medical soap opera angst-fest, but it was so much more. The cast has geniuine chemistry, not just between Shepard and Meredith, but between everyone. The characters are all fantastic, with their little quirks that have us begging for more than what the 1st season offered. <br /> <br />The patients they see also have us wanting more from the characters. Its like ER that the patients any of the patients can die at any time. Its not cheesy in that the ones we love manage to live, because, on several occasions, they have died when its least expected. <br /> <br />By having an outstanding storyline (with a jaw-dropping cliffhanger) and fantastic chemistry, the show manages to stand out among the many medical dramas seen over the years. Even though the 1st season is a bit short, its still worth checking out.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I don't feel some of the other reviews do justice to this movie. I recently saw this movie for the first time last summer and i was never a fan of tom cruise, but as a result of this movie, i now am. He played Lestat wonderfully, and Brad Pitt was amazing also. They were able to create a world seperate from our own, yet incredibly believable. I love vampire folklore and i think this movie does it justice, the book is defintely incomparible to the movie, but the movie stands well on its own. I also agree it is not a horror, more a dark dramatic fantasy, but worth watching, the passion and emotion in the movie is very real.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|i just picked up this cd today, it is great. it mixes all of dream theaters sounds in one album. i really enjoyed it. at times it is very very heavy, and it also has the slower type dt songs on it. and has a few parts that are very yes infuenced. in short its a great prog rock album. check it out.
B00001O2WQ|5.0|Mark Free's first solo cd released in 1993.  This cd is hard to find but worth the price if you can find it. Armed with great musicians he delivers another AOR masterpiece.

B0009I7NNA|2.0|This album is lackluster in vocals, composition, riffs, and sounds compared to \\"Waking the Fallen\\". The lead singer being unable to scream severely limits this band and it now tetters on the brink of Skid Row/ Twisted Sister 80's junk. The screaming is gone and replaced by vocal harmonizing. The opening track \\"The and the Harlot\\" is junk and the album really doesn't have much going on until the 2nd half in which AX7 redeem themselves a little, but overalll this album lacks the thrash metal 80's feel of the last album and feels very commercial and watered down. This must be their \\"mainstream/cash in\\" album. <br /> <br />GRADE: C-
B000001E18|4.0|Zooropa is a classic example of an album that doesn't grab you on first listen, but gets under your skin the more you listen to it.  There's nothing here particularly catchy or hooky, save the hideously titled \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!),\\" which is probably the album's low point, although it's still a decent song.  The tracks on Zooropa have a great deal of variety- some would call it \\"inconsistency,\\" but it's a positive thing here.<br /><br />First we have the title track, which unfolds slowly and beautifully.  It has a dreamlike quality created by distorted guitars and airy vocals.  Musically, it's kind of a futuristic take on \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" if you can imagine that.  The next highlight is \\"Numb,\\" and love it or hate it, you've gotta admit it's different.  Blender Magazine snidely referred to it as the Edge \\"rapping an alienated shopping list over a techno song.\\"  Yeah, it does sound like that, but I appreciate its uniqueness and I really like it.<br /><br />\\"Lemon\\" is my favorite song on the album, with its mellow mood and incredible vocals from both Bono and the Edge.  Other standouts include the infectious \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car\\" and the bass heavy \\"Some Days Are Better Than Others,\\" the latter of which has an amazing distorted guitar solo.  Finally, there's \\"The Wanderer,\\" starring (not \\"featuring\\") Johnny Cash.  I love this song, but it doesn't belong on here, it belongs on a Johnny Cash album (indeed, it showed up on his \\"Essential\\" collection).  You wouldn't know U2 were performing on it unless you were told so.  Bono doesn't even sing, except for some backing vocals near the end.  Like I said, though, it's a fantastic, moody song that does suit Cash perfectly.<br /><br />The fact that Zooropa is an overall strong effort is surprising considering how fractured and uneven it is- this feels like a b-sides/outtakes collection rather than a true album.  It's a good follow-up to the brilliant Achtung Baby and builds on its experimentation.
B00005QG9J|3.0|.....And it doesnt hold up at all to the previous two releases, SCIENCE and Make Yourself. Morning View however, does have an easy, relaxing, vibe to it remeniscent of Sugar Ray's 14:59. This is also the last album with Dirk Lance, arguably a key piece of the formula (see: Glass).  <br /> <br />   This album lacks the space themes or clever messages about social life and smoking marijuana found on the previous two albums. There is a vary \\"beachy\\" feel to the album, not suprising since ity was recorded near the beach. There are some good tracks like \\"Just a Phase\\" and \\"Warning\\", but then there is also garbage like \\"Mexico\\" which is a blatant ripoff of the \\"Drive\\" formula. \\"Nice to Know You\\" will suffice and \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" is nice way to end the album on an overall mellow, relaxing note. <br /> <br /> I miss the sense of urgency generated by Incubus going back to Fungus Amungus. Also I grow tired of Brandon's voice over 95% of the music. He can never let a good outro go, he always has to yell over it. Overall, a good album, but compred to Incubus' previous work, it is below average. <br /> <br />GRADE: C+/B-
B0006L16N8|1.0|We waited three years for this?  In my opinion, X&Y is   overproduced and extremely uneventful.  The edge and emotion is gone, and the few and far between guitar riffs get drowned out (or should I say Swallowed in the Sea) by melancholy synthesizers.  This is the sound of the fat-n-happy vs. the up-and-coming.  Save your money (if it's not too late) and buy Parachutes and/or Rush of Blood if you don't already have them.
068987474X|4.0|If I'd only read this book two years ago, I could have saved myself the upcoming divorce.  Yeah, he asked me to marry him, but we now see how that turned out.  I'm going to keep this book with me at all times...to remind me what NOT to do again.
B0006L16N8|3.0|This is a good CD, very much in line with what Coldplay does and they'll no doubt make a bundle on it. It doesn't push any boundaries or advance the band in the way RUSH did compared to PARACHUTES, and maybe it would be too much to expect another huge leap forward at this point. The band has to deal with Gwyneth now and Apple, and that may prove to be its Ono-ization. Hope not, but family tends to distract you. Whatever. Given that they could continue at all is something of a miracle. All the classical CP elements are in service, and most of it fits just where you'd expect. Sometimes that's a noble thing in itself. It is the acoustic bonus track that will grab you, though, as it seems to point to where they'll go next, assuming there isn't another live CD/DVD, or that one of the other lads doesn't hook up with an ubermodel/actress. Remember when rock bands faced crises because the drummer had a brain tumour?
B0006L16N8|3.0|I haven't bought the cd, but I've heard most of the songs from it. Over the past couple months coldplay and their new cd has been so hyped up, someone called them \\"the most important band of the 21st century\\". What?! I like coldplay, but their music has never seemed all that memorable. And I try to like their new music(and I do like some of it-fix you, speed of sound), but all I hear is U2 being copied(whether they meant to or not). And all I keep hearing is how their going to give U2 competition for best rock band. Excuse me? For one their not exactly rock(even though they`ve tried to do that a little this album), and Coldplay is no where near U2. When Bono sings you can really feel it through his lyrics and singing, where with coldplay its just kind of there. STOP COMPARING THE TWO! It seems either two thing are going to come of all their hype. A)it will hurt them, all this build up then many disappointed or B)no one will say anything, and they'll keep on being overhyped. The guys in coldplay all seem like nice guys. But it seems like people are blind, no one seems to wants to give any criticism. Their a good band, but I don't think they deserve this supergroup status they've been given. Go listen to U2 if you want that. Anyways...over all the cd was good, but not all that original or worthy of its build up.
B0002DB52M|4.0|Dogville is certainly Nicole Kidman's most provocative film, because the role is mysterious, dark, over-sexualized(she gets to endure numerous rape scenes), and insane. Surrounded by a an all star cast including Lauren Bacall, Chloe Sevigney, Patricia Clarkson, Stellan Skarsgard whom she had to endured torment and condemnation after having a pleasant stay as a refugee at the not so pleasant Dogville. The folks in this small isolated town was so nice to her at first, but they eventually turned into nasty people when she became the woman all men wanted to share. How much of nasty treatment can a woman endure before she turns herself into a \\"monster\\"?<br /><br />The cast is absolutely irresistable, and it's rare to see Patricia Clarkson play a mean and nasty woman, considered she was so wonderful in Pieces of April preiously. Bacall and Sevigney are equally good, but their roles are not strong enough. Do prepare to be amazed by the simulated nude sex scene performed by Skarsgard and Kidman, because it seemed very real while the camera actually captured his private part. At the same time, it's interesting that the scene took place in the background while another scene was being played in the foreground. There is no actual sets in this film, so every thing is transparent, and the characters would knock at a door when there was no door. Every house was drawn on the ground, which made the viewiing experience more simplistic than a stage show.<br /><br />James Caan appeared in limited screen time as a mobster. The ending was very shocking and it makes quite a provocative statement. Do give this movie a try if you are curious about the hype on Lars Von Trier, and certainly this is a rare case to see a super low budget film using so many big stars. The story takes place in America, but's shot in another country. If you are into conventional or mainstream movies, this can be off-putting, because it's the kind of film that can be easily appreciated by movie buffs who can watch anything without prejudice.atch anything without prejudice.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Generally speaking, there are two types of people in the world, those that get it and those that don't.  This record is for those that get it.  Those that insist on comparing X&Y to previous Coldplay records, in turn, simply don't. <br /> <br />I recommend listening to the record three times before passing what would otherwise be hasty judgement.  Remember 2002, shortly after the release of Rush of Blood?  The mindless masses hastily clamored \\"it's no Parachutes.\\"  Alas!  Rush of Blood ulitmately *surpassed* Parachutes in critical and popular acclaim. Hmmmm. <br /> <br />In my assessment, X&Y is a superb record and, dare I say it, every bit as good as Parachutes and Rush of Blood.  Don't let those that glaringly don't get it convince you otherwise.  Their opinions are only as valuable as the foundation upon which their built, which is shakey at best and simpleminded at worst.   <br /> <br />My advice?  Listen through the record three times and decide for yourselves -- and don't miss the hidden track.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|everything about this album kicks ass except darons singing... he just needs to stick to the guitar and let the real singer and the good one serg do it.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I like some of the songs on this album- others are kinda boring- the last song is pretty cool. The 2nd song sucks
B00009Z576|5.0|4.5 Stars  I just got Drama and I have to say that it ranks among my top 5 Yes albums (along with Close to the Edge, Yes Album, Going for the One and Relayer). Trevor Horn does a great job on vocals and sounds close enough to Jon Anderson (though sometimes straining a bit at the high notes). The backing vocals of Squire and Howe help to make the vocals sound familiar, like \\"classic\\" Yes. Geoff Downes' keyboards and synths are very textural and add a lot to the music. One thing I really noticed about this album is the energy and freshness that the Buggles seem to bring to the old Yes table, adapting Yes to the times and making them relevant, considering prog was almost dead.     Alan White is good as always. Chris Squire's bass stands out and drives the music. Steve Howe's guitar is rougher, almost metallic at times, like in the intro to Machine Messiah. Overall, Drama is more hard rock than other Yes albums, recalling the full sound of Relayer a bit though being more restrained and not as progressive. That being said, Drama is an interesting mix of progressive rock and light almost \\"new wave\\" sensibilities. While retaining the familiar Yes sound, this makes the music more relevant to the times, rather than sounding like a dated, struggling progressive band puttering out. In other words, its ability to sympathize with the musical climate of 1980 makes it better.     \\"Machine Messiah\\", \\"Does it Really Happen\\" and \\"Tempus Fugit\\" are all great Yes classics that stand up to the band's previous work.  \\"White Car\\" is a nice short keyboard track. Into the Lens is a good song, though you can't help but notice the weirdness of the lyric \\"I am a camera, camera\\". \\"Run Through the Light\\"  leans toward new wave and is perhaps the weakest song on here, but is still good. If you have an open mind about this album and the absense of Anderson and Wakeman (and can stand synths), you'll see that it is good in its own right. It sounds somewhat like \\"Going for the One\\", only a little more recent and more to the rock side like the tracks \\"Going for the One\\" and \\"Parallels\\". Simultaneously, it also sounds more like \\"Relayer\\" (which makes sense because producer Eddie Offord produced Relayer). I got this album because of good reviews and I have to say that they are right. It is an unexpectedly quality album after the lackluster Tormato and the band's split.    While the album itself is only 37 minutes long, it is packed with 10 bonus tracks that bring the total to 79 minutes. And though I would have really enjoyed hearing some live music from the Drama tour, especially \\"White Car\\" which was apparently a longer keyboard solo on tour, the interesting Howe/Squire/White tracks \\"Have We Really Got to Go  Through This\\" and \\"Song No. 4 (Satellite)\\" almost make up for it, and the aborted Paris session tracks WITH Anderson and Wakeman show just how good this incarnation of Yes is. Too bad this was their only album.
B00080ZG10|3.0|...Because \\"The Aviator\\" loses major steam the second that Cate Blanchette (Hepburn) disappears from the screen.   <br /> <br />While the latest Scorsese entry is a beautifully produced motion picture, the story all but drops off the horizon once the Hughes/Hepburn courtship ends.  Obviously, the couple breaks up and moves on to other romantic partners, but the interplay between Dicaprio and Blanchette is what kept my eyes glued to the screen for the first hour and a quarter of the picture.   <br /> <br />With the remainder of the film though, it was interesting to see Hughes' descent into mania as time went on...while I'm not altogether certain it was meant to be humorous, when Hughes orders \\"10 chocolate chip cookies, medium size chocolate chips, with none too close to the outside,\\"  I chuckled at the minutiae of his eccentricity.   <br /> <br />\\"Aviator\\" was well directed, well acted, and well, interesting up to a point.  You honestly should see this movie just for Cate Blanchette - she truly deserved her Oscar for her stunning portrayal of Catherine Hepburn.  Dicaprio was once again a solid dramatic lead, as he has shown with \\"Gangs of New York\\" (another Scorsese picture that was heartily robbed of an Oscar for Daniel Day Lewis' deeply immersed depiction of Bill the Butcher) and \\"Catch Me If You Can.\\"  All in all, a satisfying rental. <br /> <br />Don't forget to watch for Jude Law as Errol Flynn - perfect casting!
B0009I7NNA|2.0|Just like most of the other reviews, I'm a huge fan of the first two A7X albums, Waking the Fallen and Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. The first was filled with brutal metalcore and it transitioned beautiflly into Waking the Fallen with incredible riffs and solos but still enough raw dark power and energy to keep the brutality at a nice level. Second Heartbeat off of Waking the Fallen is easily the best metal song in 10 years. <br /> <br />Just when we all anticipated an incredible third album from this group, they give us a huge dissapointment, which I can only credit to a huge sellout. <br /> <br />It was claimed by the group that M. Shadows couldnt scream any more because his doctor said that it would destroy his vocal chords or something, which I don't believe at all. It seems like a pretty big coincidence that they signed on a major label where they avoid screaming like cancer. Plus his singing still seems harsh, which would probably hurt his vocal chords just as much. It just doesn't add up. <br /> <br />Combined with the lack of screaming comes more guitar solos in major scales since the last Andrew WK album and before that the \\"Top Gun\\" soundtrack. It seems to me they just want to throw away their credibility. <br /> <br />Lastly, the lyrics are incredibly lame. For some reason Shadow decides to lamely rhyme every line in most songs which ends up sounding utterly stupid. <br /> <br />The worst is the combination. In the first track chorus Shadows sings in a high falsetto \\"She's a dwelling place for demons\\" with the most fruity guitar riff in the background. It just ends up sounding embarassing. <br /> <br />If you were a fan of Avenged's old albums you wont like this. I had high hopes of them doing to the metal scene now what GNR did to the hair metal scene in the 80s, but I guess I've just found another group of sellouts. Check out Summer's End or Unearth, instead of this album and you will be much happier.
B0007VNGX0|2.0|The chorus goes \\"Have you met writer/director Paul WS Anderson? He's the biggest hack in the whole wide world, if there ever was a hack, he'd be the biggest hack, he's a big fat big fat stupid hack! Hack hack hack hack hack hack he's a stupid hack!\\" Well you get the idea.<br /><br /> REA was supposed to be the film that addressed the problems of the ill fated poorly received original RE movie, and while this film is significantly better it still falls flat on its face, and completely lacks the artistic integrity of the game on which it is based.<br /><br /> Jill Valentine, and Nemesis, and a couple others FINALLY appear in an RE movie. That's where the good news ends, however, as the film once again forces this useless Alice character into a spotlight that belonged to Jill, Chris, Leon, and Claire. The movie forces itself into the already complex plot of RE Nemesis (PS1, GCN, DC, PC). Sadly it negates the fantastic frantic storyline of the source material and instead focuses on two moody women who would never get dates in real life because their attitudes make them completely unattractive. Jill and Alice were both written as though they were the same character, and both were played out like they would get into a serious cat fight at the drop of a hat. I didn't buy that Jill would rescue Alice at the end because I never got the impression that they were getting along. But its hard to get along with yourself, really... these two were identical in attitude, tone (which was just awful) and even their posture! Not only that, but Jill in the movie was NOT the Jill from the game. They may have put her in the same costume, gave her the same name, but the way Jill came across in the movie is completely different from her superior video game counter part.<br /><br /> What it boils down to is this, game fans want to see the story of their favorite games brought to the big screen true to form. We never asked for Alice, we don't want Alice, drop kick Alice! Let's make the next one based on the magnificent RE4, let's get good actors in there, and let's get a writer that can actually write instead of just hack his way through a script. PWS Anderson is the biggest hack in Hollywood and people need to stop giving that guy projects. He ruins everything he touches. This one's not even worth playing MST3K to.he magnificent RE4, let's get good actors in there, and let's get a writer that can actually write instead of just hack his way through a script.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|I had to call my job to let them know I was going to be late to work because I wanted to go pick up this album!  I hyped myself up for this album and so far I've listened to it once.  I would rate it a 4.5 if I could, but I took the next best thing. <br /> <br />My thoughts are highly mixed with this album.  I remember hearing a sample of Panic Attack on the Gigantour website and it was incredible.  After picking it up and sticking into my awesome car stereo it started out very good.  I like the little subtle sounds happening as the similar riffs to Glass Prison/Dying Soul play out. All of the sudden BAM!  Straight and to the point Dream Theater went to a good opening.  The second song was a ballad and I'm not very fond of ballads.  The next 2 songs were above average and I did find myself drifting off. But the album soon started to pick up with PANIC ATTACK!  Awesome song as I expected.  (I really do have something with the triplet feeling riffs and usually pee my pants when i hear good triplet riffs) <br /> <br />Afterwards my attention was totally grabbed the rest of the way.  Octavarium I must say is a well balanced song of hard riffs with melodic harmony. <br /> <br />I will say that  \\"I walk beside you\\" is one of the weakest songs on the album (because its a ballad) and 2 other songs are above average and the rest are just insanly awesome! This album is definately a \\"grow on\\" album and it will take a few listenings to really understand where Dream Theater takes its music to! Obviously pertaining to the genre of \\"progressive\\" and testing new waters! I suggest all DT fans pick this one up and for the faint of heart to stay away!
B000002UJQ|5.0|When i first listened to it i thought it was a bit nothingy but after a few times through it suddenly came clear and i realised this was pretty damm good. Do not dismiss the first time round, give it at least 3 or 4 plays before deciding
B0006L16N8|5.0|I agree with what another reviewer said about some of the low ratings, these people are not a bit serious about Coldplay.  I looked at some of their other reviews and almost all of them have never even reviewed another Coldplay album.  I love this CD, there's hardly a bad track on the entire disc.  You can tell when a group goes all out like this, and really puts a lot of effort, talent, and creativity into a CD.  They did that for sure, AND THEN SOME!  While true, these tunes are a bit different then \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head, in this case change is GOOD!  They could have made an exact replica to their previous CD, but that would be predictable.  This CD is a bit more adventourous. I especially like the guitar work and while some say the similarity in style to U2 (that's only a partial comparison).  The ballads are far reaching and the music is lush (beautiful).  I would say honestly, I could end up liking this CD MORE then Rush Of Blood or Parachutes.  And that would be saying a lot because all of their CDs have been fabulous. I enjoyed this CD from the first listen, it doesnt have to grow on me.  I happened to order the Prelease and the two bonus songs are also EXCELLENT (Proof & Things I Dont Understand). If you dont have these tunes have a way of getting them, I would suggest it as part of your collection.  The hidden song is not that great (Till Kingdom Come), but that's a small point.  I purchased tickets during the presale to Coldplays Twisted Logic Tour and I got EXCELLENT seats for $50 a piece.  I look forward very much hearing these GREAT new songs live in August.  And with many bands charging ($200-$300) for good seats like these, maybe this is the last time Coldplay will be sell their tickets reasonable??  Honestly for groups like the Stones, U2, McCartney charging the kind of money they do I see it as manipulation of loyal fans.  Do the Stones really need the money enough to charge $500?  It's nice Coldplay and other less ambitious bands are not doing that.  I hope they never do!  $50-$100 is plenty enough to charge for great seats to a concert.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This 3rd album will do very well. Great songs, and one awesome hidden track ( Til Kingdom Comes) in a nod to Johnny Cash make for a perfect ending. You can't go wrong with COLDPLAY..great 3rd album. A worthy followup to their last.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|I saw this film a few months ago and I have to say that I was disappointed with it. The special effects are terrific but the story needed a lot more work and Keanu Reeves was just the wrong man for the role.The character of Angela played by the always great Rachel Weisz is actually a much better character than Keanu's and would have been a better lead as well if you had people who really cared about what they were doing in this film and Djmon Hounsou is also very good as Papa Midnight and I found his character also more integral to the story than Keanu's. At least you knew where he was coming from and he had a more lively personality than the bored stiff composure of Keanu's John Constantine and Peter Stormare gives a lively yet somewhat campy turn as Satan himself. The ending is ok but the revelation concerning a character is not well done because of the fact that we only see that character for about one scene during the course of the whole film and then suddenly you're suppose to believe that the character was a major player, which in fact the film really does not explain at all towards the end.  <br /> <br />Thumbs up to Rachel Weisz, Djmon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare for giving their best efforts to this movie but thumbs down to the lazy acting of Keanu Reeves and to the movie itself for not trying to be better than what was on the script.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002J1M|4.0|On their previous album, Nursery Cryme, the band had really solidified as an outstanding progressive rock group (thanks to the addition of Phil Collins on drums and Steve Hackett on lead guitar). On this album, they took the Victorian-style hard rock (or \\"baroque and roll,\\" as a friend of mine likes to call it) of Nursery Cryme, and added another dimension to it. Ultimately, it didn't work as well as it could, but in some areas, it succeeded better than its predecessor. <br /> <br />The first area is that of a smoother flow of music within each song. Transitions are not as noticable as they were on the last album. The first track on the album, \\"Watcher of the Skies,\\" moves brilliantly from Tony Banks's mellotron intro (scored at just the right amplitude, an improvement over \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\") into the main body of the song, with the other musicians fading up after a few minutes. The cool thing here is that even Hackett's guitar and Collins's drumming emulate the otherworldly hum of an alien starship, building upon the motif already established so well by Banks. I know I'm repeating what others have probably said, but I think this is the second best track on the album.   <br /> <br />Another of these areas is the sci/fi fantasy narrative motif in several of the songs, as well as Gabriel's penchant for assuming the roles of different characters within those lyrics. The best example of this is \\"Get 'Em Out By Friday,\\" a science fiction tragicomedy taking place in the semi-distant future, where the genes of unborn humans can be manipulated to control their height. The story involves the inhabitants of a flat being evicted to make way for shorter, more perfect human residents (perfect because Styx Enterprises, the company behind the evictions, can fit twice as many people in a flat due to their reduced height). In this song, Gabriel seems more comfortable moving between the character dialogue (you have to read the CD Booklet to see who exactly is saying what), and he also uses his impressive vocal range to give each character a unique voice. Sadly, this song loses points because, like most of Nursery Cryme, this album suffers from bad production. Gabriel's vocals on \\"Get 'Em Out By Friday\\" are so low-key (especially towards the middle of the song) that one can really only enjoy it if they listen to the song through headphones. However, Mike Rutherford's bass work is very good. This song is one of the rare moments when they brought Rutherford's instrument towards the foreground. <br /> <br />And now we come to the album's centerpiece, \\"Supper's Ready.\\" There's not too much I can say about this that won't be repeating what others have already said, but I'll do my best to make my thoughts sound like my own. This song is, simply put, amazing. It's based on a supernatural experience that Peter Gabriel's wife supposedly had, and somehow concludes with the ultimate battle between Heaven and Hell being fought and won. Each member of the group is at their peak, exploding with an energy and a passion not seen at any other point on this album (though some of the songs are good, they don't come close to this one). The transitions between chapters are surprisingly crisp, and the way the band manages to merge the overall theme of their music with what's happening in Gabriel's vocals is stunning. Especially noteworthy are the \\"charge\\" feel of Collins's drums in Part III (coupled with an amazing guitar solo from Hackett), the organ solo by Banks in Part VI, and the epic grandeur with which the song wraps up (the band reprising musical and lyrical themes from earlier in the song, but giving them a hell of a lot more thunder). One can almost see their souls igniting. The song seems to lose direction during Part V, but it gets back on track in a BIG way. \\"Supper's Ready\\" is where three of this album's four stars come from. An epic masterpiece. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, as I said earlier, there are still some production issues. The band still had difficulty finding a happy medium in the final mixing. Also, the shorter songs in between the longer ones seemed to go off in directions different from the musical direction that Tracks 1, 3, and 6 were going in. I do enjoy \\"Horizon's,\\" though. It reminds me of Yes's \\"Mood For A Day,\\" and in a way, almost serves as an intro to \\"Supper's Ready\\" (at least in my mind). I have to be in just the right mood to listen to the middle of the album. But overall, the album is outstanding. The band had proven they were both amazing musicians and avid storytellers (the staples of any prog rock band), but there was still something lacking. Something that would finally be found on their next album.
B0006L16N8|5.0|While X&Y seems to be headed in a somewhat different direction compared to their two previous albums, it definitely doesn't disappoint. Here's my song-breakdown on what Coldplay's newest album has to offer: <br /> <br />Square One - 8.4/10 - An ambitious start to what could be called an ambitious album in many ways. Maintains an up-tempo beat and rhythm throughout most of the song until it closes itself off with a final, meaningful and mellowed-down verse. Opening the album with a song like this sets up a clear distinction between this album and Parachutes/ARoBttH immediately. <br /> <br />What If - 8/10 - A slower, more sentimental song that seems to focus on the possibilities of what would or could happen if a loved one left you or someday decided he/she didn't need you anymore. It seems perfect for a situation where a couple might be going through an argument, but one person might be thinking ahead of what could happen if the problems at hand weren't resolved in the present. Sounds a bit 'too' moody at times, but does a decent job at not crossing that line into desperation. <br /> <br />White Shadows - 9.2/10 - A song that stood out from others immediately to me, thanks to its haunting and up-tempo nature. The lyrics and meanings behind the song seem to be a bit vague to decipher, but the music is what propels this song in the right direction. Despite the somewhat-confusing lyrics, the way the song closes itself off with the final verse is probably my favorite part of the track. <br /> <br />Fix You - 9/10 - Quite possibly the most beautiful song on the album, although its slow pace might not appeal to everyone at first. The message it delivers is full of hope and dedication for someone who's going through a rough time. The latter part of the track reminds me of a gospel reciting the lyrics, which in itself seems to into inject a feeling of hope and ambition into the whole theme of this song. Definitely one of Coldplay's best that will stick around and be loved for a while to come. <br /> <br />Talk - 7.9/10 - I didn't enjoy this as much as the other songs (partially because the lyrics aren't really strong, in my opinion) - but that's not to say it's bad at all. While it breaks away from the slower or more meaningful lyrics to set a style of its' own, it covers ground with some awesome guitar riffs to accompany the great beat.  <br /> <br />X & Y - 9.6/10 - Best song on the album for me. I got lost in the haunting lyrics and rhythm of the song the first time I heard it. When, \\"I know something is broken, and i'm trying to fix it... etc,\\" kicks in near the beginning, it reminds me of guitar being played in the Trans-Siberian Orchestra's rendition of 'Carol of the Bells'. This, when combined with the mesmerizing beat of the drums and the moody lyrics, sets up that perfect melancholy effect to drift away to. Simply magnificent. <br /> <br />Speed Of Sound - 9.1/10 - I found myself loving this song when the single came out... but having heard all the other songs from the album, the initial appeal wore off a little bit. Regardless - the song still sounds fantastic, and has fitting lyrics to back up the pacing of the song. Another keeper. <br /> <br />A Message - 7.5/10 - Started out as a song I didn't like/listen to too much, but has somewhat started to grow on me after listening to it more often. A simple song, but meaningful and to-the-point. Might take some time to develop a taste for and start liking, but still isn't one of the stronger tracks on the album for me. <br /> <br />Low - 9/10 - Another song that I ignored at first, but again, became a favorite of mine after giving it a chance. The first time this song played while I was driving was when I realized that this song is just amazing. It feels as if the spoon/glass effects near the middle/end of the song bring out the rest of the track and help enhance it. Overall, a great song that helps add balance to the album. <br /> <br />The Hardest Part - 9.2/10 - A song I fellin love with immediately, because it describes and reminds me of a time in the past which I can recall very vividly. That in itself is the main factor in why it's become a personal favorite of mine. Regardless of the song's meaning, it sounds beautiful - but could take a little while to start growing on you.  <br /> <br />Swallowed In The Sea - 9.4/10 - I'd be lying if I said that the lyrics to any other song from this album even come close to touching the beauty of the lyrics that make up this song. It's pure poetic bliss, accompanied by music that starts off calmly, but gets more intense as the song goes on. Aside from X&Y, this is probably my second favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />Twisted Logic - 8.7/10 - Chalk this song up as yet another one that I didn't like to start off with, but one that quickly grew on me. I have to give this song props - the lyrics are the most unique out of the entire album. \\"You'll go backwards, but then... you'll go forwards again\\" - I've had those lyrics stuck in my head since the first time I heard this song. A distinguished track that makes for a great way to cap the album off (aside from the next bonus track). <br /> <br />Til Kingdom Come - 8.9/10 - This will either be a love-or-hate track, in my opinion. I personally didn't like it too much at first, but as the growing trend throughout this album continues, I wound up loving this song after listening to it more and more. If it wasn't for the beautiful lyrics, this song would be nothing. Once you gain appreciation for the lyrics, this song is unforgettable. <br /> <br />*How You See The World (Japanese Album Release) - 9.8/10 - Dare I put an unreleased bonus track on the top of my favorites? It's truly a shame that this song wasn't released with the album everywhere besides Japan, because I was surprised at how much I eventually found myself listening to this song over most of the others after some time. It's easy to listen to, and is sung beautifully, accompanied by lyrics that don't disappoint. If you get a opportunity to listen to this, chances are good it won't let you down. <br /> <br /> <br />How would I rank X&Y compared to Coldplay's last two albums? If I had to choose between Parachutes and ARoBttH, i'd give the edge to Parachutes... but I just love the songs from both. My top 6 songs from the previous albums:  <br /> <br />Parachutes - Shiver, Spies, Sparks, Yellow, Trouble, Everything's Not Lost  <br /> <br />ARoBttH - In My Place, The Scientist, Warning Sign, A Rush of Blood to the Head, Amsterdam, Clocks <br /> <br />If I had to pick my favorites from X&Y? As of now, it'd probably be White Shadows, How You See The World, Swallowed In The Sea, X&Y, The Hardest Part and Fix You... but being forced to pick my favorite 6 seems like such a cruel thing to do, since each song has a different and unique feeling to it. <br /> <br />To conclude, i'll say this much. If you haven't heard any of Coldplay's older songs and have any curiosity to what all the `hype' is all about, listen some of the songs I mentioned above from either of the albums. Then, buy X&Y. It's just one of those albums that brings so many different things to the table, that it's hard not to enjoy and appreciate everything it has to offer. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall: 9.3/10 (not an average) <br /> <br />-KB
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|<br />    I didn't know quite what to expect when I bought mesmerize.  One friend told me he was a little disappointed in the album while another friend told me he enjoyed it and that it sounded similar to an iron maiden album.  Sense I like iron maiden so  much, I decided to buy the album.  I didn't know what to expect.  I guess I thought   the album would retain the style  of toxicity and Steal this Album and some how combine iron maiden's sound with these two styles.  I am ambivalent about the album.    While I do appreciate the  use of the double kick in the songs, The style of Mesmerize  lacks the hard edge which is so characteristic of the previous two albums.  I enjoyed the first four songs, but Songs five through   seven seem carelessly written.  However, Songs 8 and 9  once again show the bands ability to create meaningful  music.  In particular, the line in Sad Statue, \\"Sad statue of liberty and a generation that didn't agree is one of the better lines on the album.  Songs ten and eleven once again show     mediocrity in creativity.  I'm just use  to the last two albums where    I enjoyed every song on the cd.    So, I guess to sum up, I wouldn't totally write this album off, but it does not stand with Toxicity or Steal this album as one of the high points of the creativity of the band.   <br /> <br />

0790729652|2.0|This is easily the worst DVD interface I've ever seen. Besides being packaged in Warner's \\"really cheap\\" half-cardboard DVD case, it jumps right into the feature without giving you the menu screen (a pet peeve of mine), and the menu screen itself doesn't even feature a \\"play movie\\" option. In lieu of the most basic scene selection screen is a \\"jump to a scene\\" menu that gives you direct access to a little over half of the movie's chapters. If there were a \\"zero stars\\" available just for the DVD interface and packaging, this would be a shoe-in.<br /><br />The feature itself is not the fantastic film that many would want you to remember, and certainly isn't the finest superhero movie of its age (folks who say that sort of thing apparently haven't seen \\"Superman II.\\" Or the first one for that matter). The titular character barely appears in the first half-hour, and most of the film's focus is instead turned to Jack Nicholson's admittedly good Joker. That'd be fine if Bruce Wayne and Batman got anything near the same treatment, but they don't. Wayne is given little characterization, but comes across as a bumbling geek rather than a dashing playboy (something that Keaton's hammy acting and Billy Joel haircut don't help in the least bit). The choreography is laughable, and far too reminiscent of the \\"BAM! POW!\\"-style fights of the '60s live-action series that Burton so obviously tried to get away from. The plot is forced, especially the late reveal that the Joker killed Wayne's parents. Add to that a Batman (with none of the comic version's hatred of guns or killing, mind you) who, in part due to a cowl that won't let him turn his head, comes across as more buffoonish than menacing, and you have the recipe for a two hour long film that can't decide on whether it wants to be a '60s campfest or a grim, weird Burton film.<br /><br />If you want to see good Batman, check out the Animated series that debuted following the sequel to this film, \\"Batman Returns.\\" The successful Batman movies were a great deal of the reason for the cartoon's existence, and the series outshines the movie in every way.

B00097DX3U|2.0|It took me a week to write this review because I kept hoping further listening would make something click and this album would turn out to be great.  After their monstrous eponymous debut, I approached Audioslave's sophomore album with great expectations.  Formed from the ashes of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, \\"Audioslave\\" put the lie to the snide \\"supergroup\\" remarks with scorching vocals from Chris Cornell and jaw dropping guitar work from Tom Morello.  Unfortunately, \\"Out of Exile\\" is a pretty dull album that hardly features Cornell at his best, and largely wastes Morello.  Not every song is bad, far from it, but by and large the album fails to live up to potential, and is genuinely dull after the first five tracks. <br /> <br />It begins strongly enough with \\"Your Time Has Come\\", a scathing anti-war (pro-soldier) number that should have been the first single.  Whether or not you agree with Cornell's politics, you have to admire the sincerity and genuine angst with which he infuses thus one.  Likewise, some of the best guitar riffs can be found on this track, and Brad Wilk's drumming really stands out.  Next is \\"Out of Exile\\" which represents the best of the Soundgarden/Rage Against the Machine fusion that worked so well on \\"Audioslave\\".  The lyrics and vocals are classic Soundgarden (\\"When you come down to take me home/send my soul away..\\") but the syncopated pacing and driving bass line are pure Rage; another strong track. <br /> <br />The third track is the first single \\"Be Yourself\\" which in spite of a catchy beat and some nifty guitar work is hopelessly bogged down by insipid lyrics.  \\"To be yourself is all that you can do\\"?  This Sesame Street psychology has been brought to you be the letter \\"A\\" and the number 4.  However, this pop nonsense could be forgiven if the rest of the album lived up to the next track \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\".  A beautiful mix of blues, country and rock this ode to the wisdom that comes with letting go of past mistakes workslyrically and musically and along with \\"Your Time Has Come\\" is one of the two best tracks on the album.  Once again, the drum work really drives this song. <br /> <br />\\"Drown Me Slowly\\" is another solid track which I predict will probably get some decent radio rotation.  Featuring a scorching pace and Cornell's patented wail it's reminiscent of the tracks which didn't make it big on \\"Audioslave\\" but which nonetheless held it together.  It also includes Morello's longest and best solo which flips from an almost hip-hop sound to an Eddie Van Halen-esque conclusion in a way only Morello could pull off. <br /> <br />So five tracks in we have one (albeit catchy) dud, one meat and potatoes song and three really good tunes: so far so good, right?  Unfortunately, things head south pretty quickly from this point on.  \\"Heaven's Dead\\" is a slow song, which is not bad in and of itself, but it has no energy and the lyrics aren't particularly interesting.  It is also way too repetitive, with the ostensible chorus (the shockingly inane \\"Heaven's dead when you get sad...\\") making up three quarters of the song.  Next is \\"The Worm\\" which totally wastes Morello with a guitar line a college house band could come up with; even his solo, which might have felt fresh ten years ago just seems mailed in now.  It also suffers from the same problem of repetitive lyrics featured in \\"Heaven's Dead\\". <br /> <br />\\"Man Or Animal\\" turns things around a little with a bruising tempo and some more great work from Wilk (who is really the silver lining of this album).  Morello throws in some pretty sick guitar work, and even though it feels a little tacked on you have to admire the man's ability.  It's a solid entry, but not enough to turn the album around.  \\"Yesterday to Tomorrow\\" isn't so much bad as dull, with all the finesse of a Metallica ballad.  The same holds true for \\"Dandelion\\" which likewise isn't bad but rather forgettable.  You might not change the radio station when it comes on, but you're not going to seek it out either.   <br /> <br />\\"#1 Zero\\" is another forgettable song that has the distinction of being the most boring song on an album with more than its fair share.  Clocking in at five minutes it feels more like ten and features such lyrical gems as \\"If I need to/I will keep you in the corner of my eye/Corner of my eye\\".  It has the added shame of featuring a riff that sounds like it was lifted from Journey; this could be the worst song Audioslave has ever recorded.  Wrapping things up is \\"The Curse\\" another number that slogs through to a fitting conclusion to the album. <br /> <br />I have to be honest, if this had been an EP featuring only the first five tracks I'd be raving about it.  But you have to consider the entirety of the album, and the second half is pretty much a let down.  Plus, when measured against the first album and the star power of the group, \\"Out of Exile\\" suffers even more by comparison.  If this album had been put out by any number of the pathetic heirs to the Seattle sound I might have been impressed, but when you bring this kind of ammunition to the table, maybe the most distinctive vocalist around and a virtuoso guitar player, and add a bass man and drummer that are nothing to sniff at, you have to expect more.  \\"Out of Exile\\" isn't universally bad, but the good songs suffer from the surrounding tracks, and the result is an album that could have been much, much more. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />

0805076476|5.0|I don't really know why I picked up the book Fight Club a few weeks ago.  I pretty much knew the major shocker of the story through word of mouth (it's been out since 1996, after all).  I guess I just wanted to see what all the talk was about.  Gratuitous violence doesn't do a whole lot for me anymore.  Most people would have thought a book called Fight Club would be the last on my list of books to read.  I'm going to be brutally honest, I figured that if Edward Norton and Brad Pitt were willing to do a film based off the book, the book must be decent.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The book's style was utterly devoid of any unnecessary components, which, of course, sticks to the majority of the book's theme.  Very direct narrative, very short and simple dialogue.  The story is told to us through the first person perspective of the main character, but his name is never revealed.  This gives the book a sense of \\"everyman\\" that I believe forces, especially, male readers to identify.<br /><br />Our main character is tired of life, tired of his job, tired of wanting to own things only to have those things own him.  It's only after he meets Tyler Durden that he experiences life the way he's always wanted to.  It begins with \\"Hit me as hard as you can,\\" and it ends with mayhem and destruction.  We have men drawn to Tyler and his Fight Clubs because they have no sense of worth without their fights.  It is only when they fight that they feel alive, and it is only through Tyler that they feel loved.  Indeed, Tyler gains quite a cult following waiting on his every command, and our narrator is no different.  Of course, the climax is when men start dying and our narrator decides enough is enough.  He steps in to stop the very thing he'd created with Tyler, and that's when things go downhill.<br /><br />Although the story seems rather unsophisticated, it is anything but.  It is the underlying message within this book that is fascinating.  We do have an entire generation of men out there (perhaps several) who don't know how to be men because they've had no father figure in their lives.  They think to be a man means to fight and to destroy; they've never had someone show them a man doesn't have to do these things to be \\"manly.\\"  We have a whole generation of people who don't know why they do what they do.  Why do they work?  Why do they buy?  Why do they live?<br /><br />This story is tragic, funny, and captivating.  I was instantly engrossed with the characters and the plot.

1400032717|4.0|They say never to judge a book by its cover, but with The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, that is exactly what I did.  Sorry, folks, but I simply could not resist the orange cover with the cut out image of an upside-down dog.  I thought to myself, \\"If that novel is anywhere near as interesting as the cover, I'll have spent my money well.\\"  Guess what?  I did.<br /><br />Simply reading the back cover of this book, I had a fairly good idea of what to expect, or so I thought.  Well, my friends, I was wrong.  Our protagonist, Christopher, according to the back of the book, decides to investigate the murder of a neighborhood dog.  Oh, and he knows every country's capital in the world and all the prime numbers up to 7, 057.  Oh, and he hates anything involving the color yellow.  Oh, and he can't tolerate being physically touched.  You would think I would have been smart enough to figure it out.  I wasn't.  Christopher is autistic.<br /><br />Suddenly, the book took on a whole new dimension.  I don't know anything about autism beyond what I learned in Rain Man, and no matter how much I love that movie, I know that Hoffman's character was only a glimmer into the world of autism.  I was very excited when I found out that the author, Mark Haddon, had worked with autistics quite a bit as a younger man.  I really trusted him to give me an accurate depiction of this world I knew nothing about.<br /><br />Well, I still don't know how accurate his depiction was, but I do have to admit that it made for fascinating reading.  While the murder of the neighborhood dog is an interesting concept, it was made even more so by using the unique perspective of Christopher.  You must understand that Christopher doesn't think the way that we think.  Christopher doesn't experience emotion the way we experience emotion.  Having said this, however, this book proves that Christopher is not so different from us at all.<br /><br />Christopher takes us for a very interesting journey as he deals with real life issues in a manner that we, surprisingly, can relate to quite easily.  Granted, the specifics of how he deals with them are unusual; for instance, I don't believe that most of us will run through all of the prime numbers we possibly can in order to calm ourselves, nor do I believe that most of us determine what sort of day we will have by the number of red cars we see in the morning.  We all experience fear, loss, and disappointment, however, and those are some of the unifying experiences of being a human being.  I'm really afraid I can't tell you much more about the book without spoiling virtually everything, but you'll have to take my word when I say there are some really interesting, and unexpected, developments.<br /><br />Okay, so let's talk about style.  When you're writing from the perspective of a character that is not likely to express emotion in a forthcoming manner, there tends to be a lack of emotional punch.  Instead, the author presents his character in such a fashion that it is quite easy to empathize with his situation, if not with the character himself.  Meaning, we may not understand his thought processes, but we certainly do understand how WE would feel if put in his situation.  We think about how we would react, and then we read how he reacts.<br /><br />There are many, many, many digressions as our protagonist stops to delve into all sorts of explanations on math problems, science lessons, as well as present many diagrams aiding in their depiction.  Happily, these are not speed bumps in the story, although it may sound otherwise.  Rather, as already stated, the whole book features the perspective of a boy who is autistic and the book must be true to that perspective at all times.  The fact is-that is the way he thinks!  To expect a tone other than what it being presented in the novel is quite unreasonable.<br /><br />So, I would recommend that you read this novel.  It is a captivating study in character and style, and also quite informative.  It is atypical in almost every manner, and for me, that's a great experience.  And seriously, don't you want to know who murdered the dog?  It's not who you would expect.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]manner, and for me, that's a great experience.

Everything but Leper Messiah is awesome (not to say Leper is bad!). This is THE ideal metal CD. The only reason I have CDs I like more is because I've listened to this soooo many times. Get it now!

0060934719|2.0|I like Neil Gaiman. I really do. I liked Neverwhere, and I loved American Gods, both Gaiman novels.<br /><br />Stardust, however, is a completely different story. No pun intended.<br /><br />I can't believe this book is by the same author that I've read in the past. It seems so inadequate compared to his other works. It's supposed to be in the spirit of fairy tales, but it came up woefully short.<br /><br />Major issues I have with Stardust include the facts that it wasn't consistent. I was a fourth of the way through the novel before I even had the main characters figured out. The plot was convoluted and didn't become apparent until over halfway through. There was no sense of urgency, I didn't care about anyone in the novel, and furthermore, it took every ounce of strength I had just to finish the dang thing. There are few novels that I had to work at finishing.<br /><br />So, again, I like Neil Gaiman. I think he's a brilliant writer, and the other novels I've read by him are fantastic. Stardust, in my opinion, simply did not deliver.<br /><br />On a positive note, however, I will say that the last forty pages were much better than the previous ones.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]
B000002HRE|5.0|Although against popular belief, this is actually a pretty darn good album. To those that hate this, did you even listen to the whole thing? Fuel, Unforgiven II, Devil's Dance, Prince Charming, and Attitude are all great tracks. Sure, it has it's oddities, like Low Man's Lyric, but overall it's a great CD. Not for those looking for the good old Metal, but although it's different dosen't mean it's bad. If you're a starting Metallica fan, get something else, like Master of Puppets.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|Okay, I watched Team America with my 20-year-old daughter and two of her friends.  How did I know the puppets would do bodily functions on screen in graphic detail?  How did I know the F-bomb would go off every other line?  However, I found myself chuckling, laughing, and then rolling on the floor with mirth.  What a takeoff on the obligatory movie skin scene, hilarious.  <br /> <br />Any film that lumps Michael Moore, most of the Hollywood actors of liberal persuasion, and France together with Muslim extremists and Korean Dictators has to be commended.  Team America gets to blow all these folks or countries up creatively.  Moreover, that is a good thing you moth.... <br />
B00000FCBC|5.0|A great collection of Metal. All of these covers sound MUCH better than the originals. It's a nice album if you want to hear from lots of different less famous artists. Almost all the tracks are great, but the best are It's Electric, Sabbra Cadabra, Die Die My Darling, Mercyful Fate, Whiskey in the Jar, Last Caress/Green Hell, Am I Evil?, Blitzkrieg, Breadfan, The Prince, Stone Cold Crazy, Killing Time, and Stone Dead Forever (yes, basically all of them). The others are good too, but these are the best. This is an AWESOME CD. Buy it now!
B00097A5I6|4.0|I think sometimes folks buy albums expecting them to change the world on first listen. While the lead track is weak, don't let that frighten you -- the rest of the album is terrifically bouncy, melodic, and unapologetic. And it ROCKS.  <br /> <br />When was the last time you really cranked a new CD in your car or at home? You'll be doing that with \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" before you get to the forth song. \\"Ringin' A Bell\\" is my favorite track so far.
B00097A5I6|5.0|...That what is original about rock to-day isn't good, and what's good about rock to-day isn't original. Coldplay is U2, the White Stripes' best moments veer towards Led Zeppelin, and Oasis...Gerry and the Pacemakers. <br /> <br />Just kidding. <br /> <br />Yes, the music of 1966-model Beatles is alive and well here, particularly on \\"A Bell Will Ring\\" (Gem's best effort here). The Velvets haunt \\"Mucky Fingers\\", and \\"Lyla\\" merges the musical DNA of the Who and the Rolling Stones, no bad thing IMHO. Noel's allowing for the others, including brother Liam, to write has paid big dividends here. As a discriminating 50-something, it's great to hear my Sixties music so convincingly channeled by the Burnage Boys... <br /> <br />This is a great album, NO filler (it's only @40 mins. long), and should get a hearing from the U.S. audience for once. Put down that Coldplay CD and pick up some real old-school rock, Revolver-stylee.
B0006L16N8|1.0|so coldplay can make the same album twice in a row, so what?, they scrapped their original experimental album, knowing that they couldn't mess with the formula and that the corporation had them by the balls, so yeah if you like the same sounding stuff then you'll love x&y, rush of blood to the cash register was a good album but thank god for real music like radiohead and the mars volta.
0143034901|5.0|This book was mysteriously wonderful. One of the best I have ever read. We are reading it for our book club and it is the only book we have read that unanimously is one you cannot put down. Especially for those who love books, this book will strike a chord. It is touching, creepy, sad and hopeful. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is original and insightful.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I must admit, I hated Avril's first album!  At first, I had written her off as another rebellious teenage whiny brat!  Then, my roommate got me into this CD.  She's really grown up a lot since Let Go.  Compared to her debut, Under My Skin is edgier, more mature, and definitely shows more of Avril's deep side!  My favorite songs are Take Me Away, Together, My Happy Ending, Nobody's Home, and Slipped Away!  The only song that even sounds remotely juvenile on this album is He Wasn't.  But there's sill something about that song that naturally makes me sing along!  And unlike another person I know, I don't think the \\"na na\\" part of Slipped Away is immature at all!  No, I don't think she's punk.  But I do think this is one great album!  Even if you hated Avril before, just give it a chance!  Trust me, I too used to be a card-carrying member of the \\"We Hate Avril\\" club!
B0006L16N8|3.0|If Coldplay constantly want to compare themselves to U2, then they should at least produce an album worthy of those comparisons.  Don't get me wrong, this is a decent record, but it's not as memorable as \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" (which I suspect will rank as their peak of creativity).  There's nothing really new here, nice as it is, and anyone with at least 1 ear can tell that \\"Speed Of Sound\\" is too inspired by \\"Clocks\\" to be considered an exciting and new piece of work.  I like Coldplay, but they'll never catch U2, let alone top them.  Let there be no doubt, this album will be HUGE, but only because of the hype, not due to the artistic merit.  The White Stripes' GET BEHIND ME SATAN..... now THAT's a fantastic CD.  Get that and compare it with this.  No contest.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It's hard not to be swept away by the frenzy that is Coldplay at the moment. If you're here to obtain information about this CD or any other Coldplay CD (there are only the other 2 of them), then the 'talk-up' of this CD has affected you in some way (you can't be a fan - otherwise, like myself, you would have gone out to buy this CD the day it was released). Despite being a major fan of this band's music, I hereby offer a genuine review of this album; and will try to speak of it in terms of its merit rather than promote the CD blindly.    One thing for starters - don't listen to the 30-second snippets. It will only do the tracks on the CD injustice. Buy the CD, listen to it in its entirety and if you don't like it, return it (I'm pretty sure in most countries we consumers are allowed to do so - if done in good faith). Nonetheless, here's getting straight into a review of the album. If you liked PARACHUTES and A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD, chances are you're already a fan and have this CD. Otherwise, this CD is packed full with good stuff you'd learn to appreciate.    I must admit, Coldplay is an acquired taste. When I first experienced Parachutes, I found the music too raw and 'minor-key sounding' for my liking. Turns out, it is this sombre and gloomy mood that appeals to me most today. The world may have been introduced to this 3rd CD by Coldplay via \\"Speed of Sound\\"; an all too familiar sound reminiscent of the Grammy winning \\"Clocks\\" what with the repetitive piano playing and consistent yet catchy drum beats. X&Y is, actually, quite far from that.    On my first listen, the album did not impress me. The songs sit rather strangely, with not much of a tune one could associate to. There was no \\"In My Place\\" or \\"Yellow\\" to have yourself tapping and nodding to. There was no discernible, joy-evoking melody found on the CD, except for \\"Speed of Sound\\". I listened to the CD again. On my second listen, I found myself liking \\"The Hardest Part\\" and \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\". These two songs had a catchy tune to it, and my ears picked up a melody and I liked them. On these two tracks, especially \\"Swallowed\\", one is reminded of some nursery rhyme where Chris Martin starts off singing what seems like a folkish-journey song (if you know what I mean) to an almost silent background. But when the full band plays, there is a burst of musical bliss and one is overwhelmed by the uplifting feeling that Coldplay is master at evoking.    On 3rd listen, the album started to make sense. Each track found its position on the album - and I must say, great track listing. The songs seem to fit in with each other, complementing and contrasting. I discovered \\"White Shadows\\" on this latest listen, with its manic, distorted drum beats and the trade mark repetitive guitar riffs that attach Coldplay its addictiveness. What treasure! In fact, turn the volume up on this one. \\"Fix You\\" is a typical Coldplay song, and is sure to associate with fans - providing an amazing bridge where the music blows you away. Also, there is a hidden track \\"Kingdom Come\\" that is so similar to a stripped down, accoustic guitar, Bruce Springsteen song that you just can't help but marvel at the songwriting talents these 4 chaps of Coldplay have. Perfect closing to the album.    Chris Martin's singing is just as good as before, if not better. If forced to compare with previous albums, X&Y is closer to PARACHUTES than RUSH. X&Y, however, exhibits richer arrangements (perhaps more 'produced'), but portrays the similar 'minor-key', gloomy tunes that PARACHUTES introduced to the world. The CD is generally louder, has more instruments, and shows the style of RUSH on the music of PARACHUTES. Consequently, this CD is not a giant leap forward, but progression by Coldplay is obvious. There are 1 or 2 songs to satisfy those who like RUSH and prefer to stick with those songs, while Coldplay prepares fans for a transition to the next level with the band.    The album cover, of course, is some code meaning \\"X&Y\\". The CD booklet identifies the code for alphabets and if you're interested, pick up a \\"Speed of Sound\\" single to decipher the code. Great album cover.    I cannot recommend Coldplay enough. You know what? I foresee more Grammys - perhaps even a nod for Album of the Year this time.    The instruments and Martin's voice sweep and soar, the songs mesmerize and enchant, and the melancholy this CD exudes simply overwhelms. Well done, Coldplay, on this epic effort. Get this CD, if you still haven't done so.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|8th studio album finds the band stepping back a bit from the heavier tone of Train Of Thought. I might even go so far as to say that this is the band's lightest album although their prog roots are all over the place here ie. the 24 minute title track. So think of this as a better, more progressive version of Falling Into Infinity.
B00005JL78|5.0|This film is amazing. The overall feel is somewhere in between A.I and Frequency. It is action packed, full of chases, fights, and mystery. It is sad, and glorious. It is delicate, and bombastic. <br /> <br />This is a must see film.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|I liked tot- it was heavy and in your face- this is balony!!!! what sound are you going to choose? STICK WITH IT!!!! buy hillary duff instead
B0006L16N8|5.0|It's 2005 and Coldplay have now reached an astronomical level of global popularity. They are easily the biggest rock band in the world, lead singer Chris Martin is one of the most respected musicians of the past decade and I myself truly feel proud to be British. With all the aforementioned, how much hype do you think a new album from Coldplay would receive? Well, I for one certainly was not prepared for the anticipation. I knew \\"X&Y\\" was going to be big, but not this big. It's been out for one day in the UK already, and sold hundreds of thousands of copies. This album will break records in this country and become one of the fastest selling albums of all time. This is all fair and well, but it is the follow-up to the Grammy-winning, multi-platinum \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head.\\" Coldplay have a LOT to live up to, people, and this album will split people right down the middle from the minute they press the play button.<br /><br />What does this new album sound like then? Many have said that Coldplay haven't evolved their style and 'played it safe' but I disagree. There is a very noticeable maturity in the sound of this album. Martin is obsessed with the way things work, dismantling objects and rebuilding them, and the beauty of life. This is evident on the whole album, which is much larger and epic than their previous albums. The sound of this album is vast and large, almost reflecting the size and popularity of the band. If anything, they challenge U2 with the soaring choruses, racing guitar solos and massive drum sections. Is the album good then? Of course it is, I think it's bloody incredible. I expected nothing less. However, I know a lot of people won't agree, but give it time because this album will grow on you, I promise.<br /><br />The album opens with the amazing \\"Square One.\\" This is a brilliant rock opener and starts quietly with soft vocals from Martin. The drum beat then kicks in and when the chorus explodes after the first minute, you can visualise this as an epic stadium-filler. The guitars add the space in which they can bounce off the walls and echo down into your ears, and Martin's trademark cracked vocals that pierce your soul are comfortingly present when he wails, \\"It doesn't matter who you are!\\" The next song is the amazing \\"What If.\\" It begins slowly with a lone piano and Martin's questionable lyrics. A gentle pulsating hum begins arranging itself in the background in a song that seems to ask questions about Gwyneth, but that would be too obvious; it's the kind of thing you'd expect, so it's a surprise to realise this song is about Martin's connection to the fans, and sees him paranoid over whether Coldplay have dwelled in the spotlight too much. Hearing his beautiful, soothing voice wail \\"Oooo, that's right\\" is beautiful and sombre. From this, Martin can be reassured that the army of Coldplay fans very much want them in the spotlight for a long time yet. \\"White Shadows\\" is an incredible and very powerful piece of energised music. This is quite similar to \\"Clocks,\\" yet the piano is hidden. The drum beat is catchy and fast-paced, and the guitars surge through you. The chorus is amazing and races along like a stallion, as Chris Martin's vocals ascend higher and higher into the night sky. \\"Fix You\\" is the album's main ballad, and it is one filled with such intense passion and sadness. This is not quite \\"The Scientist\\" or \\"Trouble,\\" and may take a while to grow on you, but once it does the advantages are overwhelming. It begins with a soft piano solo which is very understated. It's one of those old-fashioned songs that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end, before climaxing in a proto-prog four-part harmony. The build up to this is achieved within a degree of perfection, because it doesn't become too loud as to spoil the first few minutes. It is a seamless pop production that will dominate stadiums and become an anthem for a generation.<br /><br />\\"Talk\\" is one of the highlights of the albumin my opinion, and samples Krafwerk's 'Computer Love.' The song begins off sparse and distant with an amazing guitar solo that echoes as though it were travelling around the perimeters of the universe, as a cold wind blows through your ears. The drums in this song are amazing, but the guitar solo is the real star here. The way it is arranged each time for you to anticipate it is incredible, it has me hanging on the edge and waiting for that pleasure rush every single time. Best line? \\"You could climb a ladder up to the sun. \\"The guitars become deeper and darker at the end of the song, providing the perfect outro. The album's title track, \\"X&Y,\\" is another stadium-filler that features an amazing catchphrase that will become a sing-along at Glastonbury this year. This song is steady and pounds heavily like \\"Politik,\\" swirling around and around, the guitars pushing Martin's vocals higher and higher as he sings, \\"You and me are floating on a tidal wave - together! You and me are drifting into outer-space.\\" The epic outro closes the song down to a point of obscurity, before \\"Speed Of Sound\\" begins. This is the album's lead single and entered the US charts at No.8, which is an astonishing feat for a British band! This is typical Coldplay with atmospheric guitars that buzz like static electricity with the driving drum beat. The trademark piano is ever-present, the verses are built well, and the chorus is powerful enough to keep the song going for almost five minutes. An amazing, soon-to-be classic! \\"A Message\\" begins with just a simple guitar and Chris Martin's soft vocals. It's rather intimate and close-up after the previous seven songs of open-air, stadium-filled rock. However, it soon ascends into a powerful rock piece. The real beauty, though, lies in the sheer emotion of the lyrics \\"You don't have to be on your own,\\" and the vocal harmonies in the chorus.<br /><br />\\"Low\\" is a great piece of rock music that reminds of Radiohead circa- \\"OK Computer.\\" The guitars are very strong as usual and the chorus is deep and mysterious. This is probably the 'worst' song on the album, and I use that term very loosely. \\"The Hardest Part\\" is an album highlight for me, with the beautiful lyrics and simple melody. Martin cries, \\"And the hardest part was letting go, not taking part.\\" This is a ridiculously-catchy song that undulates endlessly in the mind of the listener, as the celestial guitars flow like waves of molten gold and the keyboards shimmer like aurora in the night sky. A beautiful song that is begging to be released to radio. \\"Swallowed In The Sea\\" is a simpler song and a bit different to the complex and difficult vocal arrangements of previous tracks. This song reminds me of \\"Amsterdam,\\" but it opens up much earlier. The way Martin arranges the melody is very catchy and memorable. I love the imagery of this song, such as a thousand houses, one hundred miles, and trees being cut down and swallowed in a sea. It's a very natural, earthy and organic song. \\"Twisted Logic\\" closes the album and is yet another brilliant song where Martin wails, \\"You'll go backwards but then, you'll go forwards again!\\" Twisted logic, indeed! It works incredibly well with twisted guitars screeching and crying all over the melody, and serves as possibly the best outro to a Coldplay album we have witness to this point; unlike the final rock-out minute of \\"Amsterdam\\" from AROBTTH, this song is five minute of all-out pure rock!<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />There is also a hidden track at the end of this album in the form of \\"Til Kingdom Come,\\" which was written for Johnny Cash, but unfortunately could not be recorded by him because of his untimely death. If you're looking for songs that are immediate and satisfying as \\"The Scientist,\\" \\"Clocks,\\" \\"In My Place,\\" or \\"Yellow,\\" then I think you may be initially disappointed with this album. Coldplay became popular in America with the release of their second album, where the melodies were strong and memorable, and I think a lot of American fans will feel disappointed because of this. Your loss if you feel this way, because this album is an incredible work of art. The melodies are there, you just have to be patient and look for them over repeated listens. And the true test of whether or not you can hear this will come in your appreciation of the album. I expect by Sunday, this album will have sold around 500,000 copies in the UK alone and will break all records. Coldplay have set the bar incredibly high with this album, which has simply made expectations for their fourth album ludicrous. I wouldn't be surprised if they packed it in for good after a world tour with this album, because this is truly the album of the decade and will top many Best Of lists for years to come.rs are very strong as usual and the chorus is deep and mysterious.

B00070Q7VO|1.0|i have respect for any out there trying, and I certainly wish this kid the very best BUT... Michael Buble is NOT the real deal. . . . honestly doesn't really sing or even swing that well . . . .he doesn't hold a candle to the real thing. not even close. why buy this derivative xxx when you can buy Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennet, others. . . . sorry Michael Buble - you don't have \\"it\\".<br /><br />if you're looking for a great modern big band swing record, try out an album from the man who \\"discovered\\" michael buble: Mr. Paul Anka and his new album \\"rock swings\\"
B0009I7NNA|5.0|<br /> <br /> At first listen some not-so-well-informed listeners will assume that since they're on a major label now, the corporate fat cats that be have ordered them to ixnay on the screaming vocals......BZZZZZT! Wrong. <br /> <br /> While playing in Leeds last year, vocalist M.Shadows suffered a broken blood vessel in his vocal chords. After several surgeries and months of training with a vocal coach (whom has worked with the likes of Axl Rose), his singing voice (which was incredible to begin with) is back and better than ever. And at risk of losing his voice for good; he's been medically advised to let the screaming vocals go the way of the dinosaur. <br /> <br /> It's more than evident that 2003's Waking The Fallen barely scratched the surface of the musical ability and range that this band posesses. The songs have become even more diverse and epic. Also, Zacky Vengeance and Synister Gates have given in to their urge to shred their asses off. Admittedly, their guitar work is worlds above their ability to choose stage names (sorry guys, couldn't help it). <br /> <br /> You almost feel naughty banging your head to their lead work...just because it almost doesn't seem right to hear this kind of fast fretting indulgence. But if it's wrong; I don't want to be right. <br /> <br /> The Rev (drums), and Johnny Christ (bass) are much higher in the mix this time, and don't think for a second that it's a bad thing. Mr. Rev's drumming is a suspected result of a genetic engineered splice between Dave Lombardo and Vinnie Paul. And to call Johnny's work on the low end 'solid' would be a gross understatement. <br /> <br /> Though not a bit shy about wearing their influences on their sleeve, none of this sounds derivative in the slightest. After all, if the rock media can call Jet a great new band (with their recycled AC/DC leftovers).... this is groundbreaking. <br /> <br /> Once again produced by Mudrock, the sound is much less prone to clipping as the last album was. Thisis largely due to a major label budget I assume. <br /> <br />  With some songs bordering on sensory overload due to breakneck tempo and dynamic shifts, this is a dark/light dynamic that would give a photographer an anuerysm (I hope I spelled that right).  <br /> <br /> To close in short; this album is 11 tracks and clocking in at just under 73 minutes. If you're tired of hearing cheesy synths, whining, bird calls, and stupidly simple arrangements being passed off as metal (not going to name names, but it rhymes with Disturbed), do yourself a favor and pick this album up. <br /> <br /> This just may be a sign that we're at the beginning of an era where it is once again okay to know your ass from a hole in the ground concerning the instrument you play. <br /> <br /> Five stars, and two sets of horns....way up. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|I LOVE this album. I was so unsure of what to expect, especially after two AMAZING previous albums, but this CD is incredible. The music is almost excruciatingly lush and beautiful. Some of my personal favorites so far are Swallowed In The Sea, A Message, Til Kingdom Come, Talk, Hardest Part, Fix You and What If. This album, in my opinion is just as brilliant(If not MORE) as RUSH OF BLOOD. I am surprised at some of the reviewers mentioning a lack of evolution as far as the music goes, but I am actually thrilled that the band is sticking to a sound that best suits them. They are growing musically, but they are remaining true to the music they play best. I am glad they didn't pull a Radiohead and go all computer techno blip noise on us fans! I have seen Coldplay live and I am looking forward to seeing them play these new songs in person. There is not much more I can say about this wonderful cd...BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|With nine members, i'm really suprised that these guys sound as great musically as they do.  These guys, I believe are a breath of fresh air for metal fans around the world, because they are bringing the heaviness that was shown on classic albums by Pantera and Slayer.  Not that Slipknot are as good as Slayer or Pantera, but the sound is close to the same. <br /> <br />Prelude 3.0 - It's nothing special, just an intro.  It's longer than the intros on their debut album and on Iowa, but it's really just something to skip.  *** <br /> <br />The Blister Exists - This is one of my favorite songs on the album.  It's really heavy and the guitars and drumming were excellent.  **** 1/5 <br /> <br />Three Nil - This is my favorite on the album for it's all around heaviness.  The Guitars and drumming were once again superb, and I feel that they really just nailed this one.  ***** <br /> <br />Duality - It's a hit, and it's a good song, but it's more relaxed than some of the heavier stuff they've put out. Still a good song though.  **** <br /> <br />Opium of the People - This one was actually really good.  Most people I know skip it, but it's nice and heavy and the first 33 seconds of it are awesome.  **** <br /> <br />Circle - This one is strange.  It's acoustic, so that's new.  I think Slipknot should stick with extra fast drumming and super heavy distorted guitars.  ** <br /> <br />Welcome - Sounds a lot like something from their debut album, or Iowa.  It's mega fast, and Corey screams his lungs out, but I don't really like it too much.  *** <br /> <br />Vermillion - I see nothing in this song, at all.  It sounds like they are turning nu-metal on us with this one.  ** <br /> <br />Pulse of the Maggots - The tribute to Slipknot fans (maggots.) This song is good, heavy, and fast, and the 40 second intro is pretty intriguing, with the sirens and the marching-type drums in background.  **** 1/5 <br /> <br />Before I Forget - Another of my favorites. Sounds a lot like something from Iowa, kind of like Left Behind. It's a good song, and not one to skip.  **** 1/5 <br /> <br />Vermillion Part 2 - I like this one a lot more than I like the other one, and it's acoustic.  Corey sounds a lot better actually singing this one than just whispering it.  *** 1/5 <br /> <br />The Nameless - Give it a try, you might like it.  Good lord, though, Joey, the drummer, has some serious skills.  Man, he's fast.  Mick and James, the guitarists, have some serious tremelo pick skills.  They should be named the Kings of Shred.  ****, just for the musicians' skills. <br /> <br />The Virus of Life - I think this is a very pointless song.  It sounds like screwed up carnie music.  ** <br /> <br />Danger: Keep Away - I love this song.  Most people hate it, but I see no reason for hating it.  It's a great song to finish up a great effort by a great band.  ***** <br />
B0009I7NNA|2.0|I feel like a tough critic.  But after looking at everyone's review, I guess that I'm not alone on how bad this CD is.  Wow, how disappointing.  I was waiting for this CD for months...very excited since \\"Fallen\\" is so amazing.  When I heard that they were going to Warner, I was worried.  After listening closely to this record, I don't think it's Warner's fault.  The songs are just bad.  They flow into each other.  There's no character to each song.  Shadows voice appears very dead.  Man, I just don't what else to say.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When we do colonize space, chances are this is what it will be like: no bad guys other than ourselves. There may be life out there, but I don't think they're waiting for our first warp signature.  <br /> <br />If after watching Firefly you wonder why it was cancelled, remember network execs always program to the lowest common denominator and don't know what to do with a series that requires a bit of attention to witty dialog. Also, Firefly was aired erratically, no one knew if there would even be another episode. The canceling of Firefly falls right in the programming department's lap. It's a sad commentary on the state the entertainment industry. <br /> <br />A couple of weeks ago, we took our 12 year old twins to see a preview of the unfinished Serenity (the first of a trilogy of Firefly theatricals in the making). Even in its incomplete state it was a treat. We are all impatiently waiting for September 30th and the final theatrical release. As children do, the girls are playing the discs whenever they can. They even want a Firefly marathon birthday party to introduce their friends to it. They just adore River and Kaylee! <br /> If you haven't seen it ... buy it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a traditionalist when it comes to a movie.  I look first of all for a strong story and characters I can care about.  Firefly has both, plus humor and action, again, traditional marks of solid entertainment.  A recent book on Firefly pointed out that the show is masterfully constructed, with, for example, sightlines and camerawork used to build a relationship between the human characters and the ship they are in.  I had, for example, noticed subliminally that the character of Inara, the geisha/ambassador, had a particular aura, but had not realized that her character was deepened by set design, including especially the use of the color red.  Nor had I given a great deak of thought to the music, which, I realized only on reflection, not only set the mood but moved the story along as well.  This is a potential classic, defined as a work you can watch time and time again, learning or appreciating something new each time.  I'm on my third viewing, looking forward to the movie, and hoping that this wonderful story continues through many sequels.  There are memorable characters here: the beautiful, dignified and vulnerable Inara, the thuggish clown Jayne, who may have an ounce of decency somewhere, and the inscrutable Shepherd Book, to name only a few.  This is one of the triumphs of television history.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is by far the greatest cd to come out in a long time. Yes it does suck that he doesnt scream but in some parts it sounds as though him not screaming makes it harder and more metal. A7X just saved my whole thought that music was dying. I have never heard such great guitar ever its just an amazing cd. THe only improvement i could see them doing were shadows cleaning up his vocals a little but it is still a great album. THank u avenged sevenfold five stars isnt even enough to rate this album.  <br />P.S. <br />Seize the Day is the greatest song ever written
B0000AQS0F|4.0|An excellent concept for a science fiction series.  Excellent characters are well developed and acted, and this is one of the few SF genre shows which does not rely on just action the special effects.  Too bad Fox cancelled it, as the second season might have been even better!  Much more realistic than the sanitized Star Treks, the parallels with frontier America are taken just a wee bit too far, IMHO.  The country/bluegrass style musical score was a turn-off.  My only complaint, but enough to take it down to 4 stars.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|Let me first say, how can you review cd that isnt out yet (this refers to people that reviewed this cd before today).  Second, if you got this cd off a P2P program such as; Ares, Kazaa, Lime Wire or whatever then you have the wrong cd.  I did this myself.  I downloaded the whole cd of what I thought was Dream Theater's newest album entitled \\"Octavarium\\" and after a little bit of research I come to find out that it was James LaBrie's solo cd entitled \\"Elements of Persuasion\\".  Yeah, now im a little pissed.  So if you think you have \\"Octavarium\\" then go ahead and think that but if I were you I would look up \\"Elements of Persuasion\\" and preview the songs to make sure......

B0006L16N8|4.0|Well, here it was. I was sitting at this very place yesterday, staring at a brand new copy of the most anticipated release of this year, sober save for the coloured coded message, light reflecting off it's glossy surface. <br /> <br />Well, my heart wasn't exactly beating in my throat. Still, I was excited yet nervous in the face of the new album, nervous because I was afraid that Coldplay's third release would be the pin that would puncture and deflate my hopes for the record. <br /> <br />I won't say it was. After all, I have only listened to it twice. Still, the single Speed of Sound didn't really get my blood pumping. Certainly not when compared to the first singles of Coldplay's previous two albums, In My Place(from AROBTTH) and Yellow(from Parachutes). So I popped the disc into the computer(which, by the way, although it has copy protection, comes with a neat little player of it's own). On the first listen I was admittedly a bit disappointed. This was one long, vast expanse of sound. There didn't seem to be much variation either. So I was left at the end wondering how I would rate it and how it compares to their previous albums. <br /> <br />Then I listened to it this morning. Slowly, things began to click. I realised more than ever now that this record was definitely a grower. Which also seemed to be a matter of supreme irony, since although Coldplay has built further upon their trademark sound on X&Y, the record on the whole is actually less catchy and appealing to the general public! That should do away with the accusations of X&Y being some sort of corporate scheme to bring money in the drawers of the ailing music industry! Not that it is easy to imagine Coldplay as such a band. Now some people(actually, a LOT of people) claim that the band are stuck where they already were. That they haven't made any musical progression whatsoever. I beg to differ. It is virtually impossible for a band NOT to make any musical progression. Because, a band invariably changes inbetween recordings. The stadium-filling, paparazzi-punching, celebrity-dating Coldplay of now isn't the virtually unknown Coldplay of 2002. True, they might not have started churning out slick R&B tracks in the style of Justin Timberlake, but that does not mean that they have become musically stagnant. And there has certainly been a shift in mood. The band and Chris in particular almost buckled in the face of enormous pressure, both from the rest of the world and from themselves. Musically, the Beatles influence from A Rush of Blood...has diminshed. Instead, I can hear traces of Pink Floyd. This also becomes apparent in the whole setup of the album, which contains few catchy melodies and rather needs to be listened to as a whole. On the first listen, the album sounded uninteresting to me because the curious melodic shifts from AROBTTH(like in the title track and God Put A Smile On Your Face) have all but disappeared. Also, Chris's voice soars to greater heights, which on the surface makes him sound more cold and impersonal. Coldplay's latest definitely requires more than a few listens. Which is actually true of all Coldplay albums - when I got A Rush of Blood to the Head, I frequently skipped God Put A Smile On Your Face. A month later it was one of my favourite tracks. There are two stand-out tracks though. One is Low, the other is Twisted Logic. Both contain those strange Beatlesesque major-minor chord shifts that we have come to expect after AROBTTH. They both play with the head while firmly lodging themselves there. Twisted Logic is in the same league of spectacular closes as Everything's Not Lost and Amsterdam. A class track.  <br /> <br />A minor complaint that I have though is that there seems to be little variety in the songs. Lyrics were also never Coldplay's strongest point, but sometimes I do raise my eyebrows. The much-publicized electronic influences are almost absent, really, which may or may not be a good thing. <br /> <br />What bothers me thoughis that Coldplay's credibility will most likely plummet with this release. Sweeping and slow-burning, it is not a record which will be likely to appeal to the masses. Which might be a good thing after all, since it might give Coldplay the time and space to finally create a record to astonish us all.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|all u fags giving this cd a low rating can all go to hell.  this is one of the best albums ive ever heard.  the guitars and drumming are insane and there is absolutely nothing wrong with his voice. it has got to be their best album ive heard.  so just stfu and keep ure pussy comments to ureself, u are definatlely not an A7X fan if u think this cd sux!!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Don't listen to a single review here, contrary to this one obviously.  Listen to the samples or download a few (deleting them within 24 hours, of course), and make your own judgment, not what a few people unable to move on have to say.
B0006L16N8|3.0|To me there are not great standout songs (except for Speed of Sound),  The album is very similar to the other two.  It's good, but not great.
B0007GAEGC|2.0|I watched this and found it to be way overrated and you could tell it was all lip-synced.
B00079FUI6|3.0|Nobody - and I mean nobody - was higher on Desperate Housewives than I after seeing the pilot episode, which may have been one of the best hours of television I have ever seen. Better still, it holds up to repeated viewings. <br /> <br />So imagine my disappointment as the show became one of the most uneven in recent memory. Yes, there were unforgettable moments such as Bree's comically tragic dinner party and the ultimate fate of her philandering husband, Rex. But more often than not, storylines took far too long to unfold and, even worse, twists were easily figured out far in advance. Anyone who didn't see the big \\"revelations\\" regarding Mary Alice and her past coming at least three or four episodes before the finale has probably never seen any of the daytime soaps being lovingly mocked by their primetime sibling.  <br /> <br />The final episode of the season does deliver several standout moments, but, again, falls far short of what many were expecting. Billed in advertisements as ending with a major, shocking cliffhanger, viewers were no doubt left wondering if they'd missed something when what they got was... well, not to give anything away, but basically a spin on the old \\"three people and a gun\\" scenario.  <br /> <br />Is Desperate Housewives worth viewing? Yes and no. Suspend your disbelief, be prepared for several \\"now why the heck would anyone do something so stupid?\\" moments and, if all else fails, skip through the episodes and watch the sublime scenes featuring Felicity Huffman and Doug Savant as the most likeable - not to mention relatable - folks on Wisteria Lane, Tom and Lynette Scavo.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold is a very unique band. Their first two releases, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and Waking the Fallen have shown that they have the talent of a legendary metalband, with the powerful emotion of today's metalcore. With thrashy drums and a perfect blend of screaming and singing, these two magnificent albums represent the beginning of Avenged Sevenfold--using the metal influences they love most to create a unique blend of \\"kid-friendly\\" metalcore. With their latest release City of Evil, A7X has run away with the metal side of their music and left the screamo behind. This new music is remeniscent of a classic metal masterpiece--every song has its hard hitting moments and its poignancy. The guitar work is stunning, the double attack of Gates and Vengeance will grow in the world to a great status. The bass is definitely turned up on this cd, and the riffs get much more technical. The drums are different, but for the better--they branch out from the very common \\"thrashier\\" style of WTF and STST, and into a different, more complicated unique style. And then there were the vocals--the biggest change on City of Evil. This is where Shadows gets to shine, as he is easily the best vocalist to come out of rock in the past couple of decades. He throws aside the screaming so he can showcase his unbelievable singing talents. Often his voice is remeniscent of Axl Rose and just as often he won't be as raspy but still perfectly on pitch like a solo artist. It is hard to fit City of evil into a genre--whether it is Metal, just plain Rock, still Metalcore, or even at times it is classical. The band also likes to describe some parts as \\"death-western.\\" Don't let this range of styles turn you off from the cd though...it all fits together perfectly. City of Evil is an epic for our generation...and one of the greatest cd's the world will have seen in a long time. <br /> <br />Beast and the Harlot - a grungey opener with a killer solo and vocals remeniscent of zakk wylde. 7/10<br /> <br />Burn it Down - With very catchy riffs, lots of tempo changes, and a great variety of vocals, this is a good sample of alot of things to come on the cd. 8/10 <br /> <br />Blinded in Chains - a really cool opening to this song, with lots of good riffs scattered here and there, and a unique sounding verse. 8/10 <br /> <br />Bat Country - inspired by \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\\" this will be the first video for City of Evil. one of the greatest bridges i have heard in my lifetime. 10/10 <br /> <br />Trashed and Scattered - The beginning, with all the layers of sound almost sounds like a really fast heavy rock classical piece, if you can draw that from it. This is a really good song. 8/10 <br /> <br />Seize the Day - A ballad very remeniscent of A7x's Warmness on the Soul, or a poppy GnR, with some good solos. 9/10 <br /> <br />Sidewinder - Latin inspired rock song for the first 4 minutes which is alright, then the last 2.5 minutes are a stunning latin acoustic piece with great vocals, backing, and an awesome solo. 10/10 <br /> <br />The Wicked End - My favorite song on the CD. Starting off almost like a song from WTF, this goes from mid-tempo, to blatantly fast, and heavy, with a cool solo, and about half way through there is an orchestral interlude supported by a choir, and then the band comes in and plays over it. Spectacular piece of music. 20/10 <br /> <br />Strength of the World - A 9 minute \\"death-western\\" epic only Avenged Sevenfold could create. Brilliant song from start to finish. 10/10 <br /> <br />Betrayed - A rock song about the assassination of Pantera's Dimebag Darrel. Probably my least favorite on the cd, but that does not turn me away one bit. 7/10 <br /> <br />M.I.A. - A song that sounds like ...And All things will end, the WTF closer. My second favorite on the cd, starts really slow and then bursts into all out metal with a cool solo and \\"choir-y\\" sounding finish, with shadows turning things down a bit, and then a solo fading out thecd. another great piece. 20/10 <br /> <br />be sure to listen to this cd. i'ts brilliant.
B000002LBH|5.0|I'm way into extreme metal, grindcore, death metal, black metal, industrial, noise rock, and super tough-guy hardcore, but I turn into a weepy little fangirl every time I throw on the Smiths.  They're just too good!!<br /><br />Morrissey's gorgeous voice and Wildean wit are the real stars here.  Johnny Marr's great and all, but you don't see him with an excellent solo career, do you?  Morrissey's croon is nearly overwhelmingly powerful and beautiful, and his lyrics complement his voice perfectly.  While it's true that the lyrics generally revolve around depression, isolation, and a generally bleak view on life, they (as well as his voice) are really not as consistently whiny as some naysayers claim; he certainly has a dramatic flair, which many foolishly mistake for melodrama.<br /><br />The melodies of the songs...positively tickle me pink!  You honestly can't help but shiver in amazement when you hear pop songs as good as \\"Is it really so strange?\\" and \\"Half a person.\\"  You will savor every second of the songs like you were enjoying time with a lover or an old friend.  God, all of this sounds absolutely ridiculous, but hey, the Smiths are really that good!<br /><br />I'm really horrible at expressing exactly how I feel about this band because they are simply too good for words.  That, and I chose to review a singles collection instead of a proper album, but this has 24 tracks!  24 glorious tracks!  That's 74 minutes of pure, unfettered bliss!!  You NEEED!!!!
B00097A5HW|5.0|I actually haven't heard any of the record but i sure hope its better than those awful nike commercials she did that irritated me more than bleeding hemorroids. And any 5 ft midget belly dancing looks friggin funny no matter how hot she is. but i can't wait to hear it.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Yes M. Shadows doesn't yell at all on this album but no one knows for sure if the rumor of him not being able to yell is true or not, don't just trash the guy just becuase they signed to Warner Records. He's very talented, now he may not have shown it very well on this album in the lyrics, he still sings very good. The guitar and layout of each song is also very good. Now if you're a huge fan of the old albums then you may not like this, it all is just everyone's opinion. These days not many people like tons of different types of music, so you never know, if a band gets soft on you, you may not like it. I personally think the new album is great and I am also a big fan of \\"Waking the Falllen\\" and \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\". I just really think they could have done better on the lyrics but hey otherwise it's a great album from them. <br /> <br />1. Beast & the Harlot - 8/10 The song is kind of cheesy at some parts <br /> <br />2. Burn it Down - 9/10  <br /> <br />3. Blinded in Chains - 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Bat Country - 9/10 <br /> <br />5.

Srength of the World - 10/10 Beautiful song <br /> <br />10. Betrayed - 9/10 <br /> <br />11. M.I.A. - 9/10
B0009I7NNA|5.0|WOW. this is a simply amazing album. forget everything you ever new about avenged sevenfold. this album is a complete new sound. the best way i could describe it is iron maiden meats guns n roses, with some pantera-like guitar and a touch of metallica here and there. before i got through a song by song review, i have a few things to make clear about this album. yes there is no screaming, yes m. shadows (the lead singer) did tear his vocal chords and had surgery, yes he was told that if he kept going like he was in 3 years he would need more surgery and he couldnt sing at all in 8 years. however, shadows found a way to scream from his stomach so he didnt use his throat, so he can still scream if he wants. avenged sevenfold decided that they dont wanna be a hardcore band, they dont like hte scene kids and they dont listen to hardcore. that is the reason for the change of sound, not cause warner made them (if your gunna sell out you wont make 7 minute long songs) and not cause shadows cant scream. now, to the songs, im going to review each one out of 100 cause if not they would all be either 9/10 or 10/10    1. beast and the harlot - 92/100 - this was the first song released, and far different from any a7x stuff. very iron maiden like with some velvet revolver type vocals near the end. the vocals are weak, but they fit the song. nice solo, synyster    2. burn it down - 90/100 - personally i think this is the weakest song on the cd. i love the carnival type riff, and i love the end and all of the high notes, but i think it jumps from place to place to abrubtly. still a great song, also the only song on the cd not to break 5 minutes... its 4:59    3. blinded in chains - 96/100 - great chorus, fans of waking the fallen: note that the guitar is very similar to \\"chatper four.\\" best song on the cd so far, but still a ways to go. great drumming from the reverend, awesome bass riff from johnny christ    4. bat country - 98/100 - rumored to be the first single of the cd, this is an awesome song with a great sing along chorus. the song is about the movie \\"fear and loathing in las vegas.\\" another awesome song, great dual guitar solo from synyster gates (lead guitar/solo's) and zachy vengence (rhythm guitar but sometimes sounds like lead)    5. trashed and scattered - 94/100 - another song released early, great chorus and a very angry track sent out to all the magazines and people who spread rumors about a7x. this and \\"blinded in chains\\" are the only songs without a solo    6. seize the day - 1000/100 - 1000 probably isnt enough. this is the slow song, but not like IWSUTP1 (this ones about 5:30). amazing how much it sounds like guns n roses, great vocals and songwriting, my favorite solo of the album from sla--er... synyster. everything fits great, my favorite of the cd.    7. sidewinder - 100/100 - the only possible complaint about this song is the... interesting... lyrics. great chorus, and the santana-like acoustic ending is one of the most amazing things i've ever heard    8. the wicked end - 99/100 - instrumentally, the best song in maybe a decade. the guitar is simply incredible, the 14 piece string orchestra comes in out of nowhere, and seems out of place if you dont know what the song is about (its about the world ending)    9. strength of the world - 97/100 - at the begining of the song you'll be like wtf is this? then the western intro ends and the guitar riff comes in. awesome song, longest on the cd at 9:14.    10. betrayed - 98/100 - this is the song that is dedicated to dimebag darrel of pantera, and is told in the perspective of the shooter. awesome chorus, and i love the guitar peice at about 3:45, nothing too heavy, just something that sounds simple yet amazing at the same time    11. MIA - 99/100 - this song would be a 97 but the solo is just amazing. the most impressive solo on the album, both awesome guitarist play out for well over a minute. amazingly catchy chorus, but whats up with the yawning vocals at the end?    i have never heard guitar like this before. 73 minutes of madness. prepare for some of the most amazing solos and riffs being pulled, and if you've seen their live clips you will see that they are being pulled with ease. my only complaint on the entire album is shadows vocals, he's supposively trying to have more of a metal singing sound but i dunno maybe his throat isnt fully healed yet cause the clean vocals in WTF were way better. instrumentally, you will not hear a better band in todays world, and avenged sevenfold could very well be the future leaders of metal (they are only 23 except for johnny who is 20) and possibly the next metallica, or even better, the first avenged sevenfold    edit: after reading many other reviews i noticed that people would say that there are better metalcore or metal bands out there. PLEASE, PLEASE i beg you do not judge this album as a metal album or metalcore album, judge it as music. who cares what label its in, just say if its good or bad. also, for everyone thats critiquing the song writing, read the lyrics. betrayed is amazingly written from 3 POV's the wicked end is written with direct references to the bible and hidden ones all over, and others are also well written if you understand the meaning of them. thank you
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's third piece of incredible work, X & Y, is not only their best yet, but one the year's greatest releases.  <br /> <br />This is a superb album, Coldplays finest and after the last two that is saying something. No song is a filler (you can see the benefit of writing and re-writing) and no babies, marriages etc have changed the band as claimed by the press! This album is MUST HAVE music. It's not rock, pop, indie... it's simply AMAZING! So buy it, it'll be available everywhere! <br /> <br />All I have to say is that X & Y is their most monumental achievement in all musical aspects. A symphony of perfection and brilliance. Forget A Rush Of Blood To The Head...this is THE Coldplay's definitive album...so far.
B000002JS6|5.0|Screeching lyrics of sex and rock, metal thrashes and overwhelmingly loud riffs, and catchy drum beats in many ways defined AC/DC's signature metal sound, plastered all over Back In Black with perfection. Although musically is often criticised, the band offer great chemistry within their riffs and screams, coming together nicely after a tragic passing of former band member Bon Scott.<br /><br />Although maybe not completely original in sound, AC/DC revolutionized rock in many ways with this album. A powerful opener Hells Bells begins this 39 minute metal extravaganza. An instant classic, with a superb guitar riff that becomes imbedded in our heads. This powerful opener sets the tone for what's to come, an album filled with rising riffs, catchy choruses, and a great deal of melodic sense within the metal. Shoot To Thrill is another great example of AC/DC's talent. Givin The Dog A Bone is a ridiculous chorus, built around stunning riffs of joy. Let Me Put My Love Into You is almost the sensitive side AC/DC wished they could express with a lighter aspect. Instead they use a raunching guitar solo in between which makes for some classic metal. The self titled track features a very catchy, immediately recognizable guitar riff. Another classic follows with You Shook Me All Night Long, featuring almost a metal balladic side, with the beautiful, high pitched chorus ringing through your ears. A n almost blues based introduction starts off Have A Drink On Me, and keeps with the consistency of the album, as the group stays very close to their metal roots in previous songs with a catchy metal riff. Maybe the least memorable follows with Shake A Leg, simply lacking in any compelling guitar riff. Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution however closes the album exceptionally well, featuring a slow paced intro into heavy bounces of metal sensation featuring a chorus suggesting \\"rock n' roll ain't gonna die\\". Unfortunately, although it stayed alive through to the mid 90s from the likes of Guns n' Roses and Nirvana, I consider it to be no more.<br /><br />Easily a landmark album in the metal genre, AC/DC in certain ways replaced KISS with this album, with a slightly different sound, and a screechier outlook on metal, and using the metal noise to create sensational music. Absolutely a must for all metal fans, and any AC/DC fan should own this, casual or diehard. Also, if you listen to groups like Linkin Park and Good Charlotte, don't purchase this album, and remember that that isn't the same kind of metal<br />Highly recommended.' Roses and Nirvana, I consider it to be no more.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I pre-ordered this CD and got three bonus tracks.  This CD is amazing, I must say.  It's a CD where you can listen to it over and over and over again without getting bored. <br /> <br />I haven't been a TRUE fan of Coldplay until now.  Their hit single 'Speed of Sound' is probably the song that popularized this album. <br /> <br />The best song (IMO) on this album is \\"Fix You\\".  The lyrics on the song are amazing, not to mention the melody and actual music on it.  This album is a MUST, especially if you are a Coldplay fan.

0316168815|5.0|The Lovely Bones is NOT about what heaven is like and where the dead end up. However, it IS about how the dead affect the living and how those who remain deal with their losses. This is truly an amazing book and helps others cope with life's troubles. Alice Sebold does a beautiful job describing the effects of death on the living.  <br /> <br />If you are planning on reading this novel, make sure you read it for the right reasons. DO NOT read The Lovely Bones to find out what heaven is like, because that is NOT what the novel is about. If you are dealing with a loss, this may just be perfect for you. However, whether you are dealing with a loss or not, The Lovely Bones is an awesome novel and well worth reading.  <br /> <br />So...have fun!
0385510454|3.0|The novel started out nice, but mid-way got a little predictable. The characters seemed quite boring at times. Some of the important characters seemed unreliastic, which included President Morgan, Teddy Maynard and Critz. Even Backman/Marco seemed almost superhuman at times, in the way he adapted to his new environment and situation.  I had a problem with the ending as well. The last few chapters promised a lot and delivered very little. Particularly unbelievable was Marco's use of Giovanni's passport without anyone suspecting anything, both in Europe and  US. On the upside, some of the descriptions of Bologna and its landmarks are quite good, although I cannot vouch for their accuracy since I have not been there. On the whole, I would say this is a readable novel if you have nothing better to read or are stuck on an airplane/train, but I wouldn't spend half the night trying to finish this novel. The only other John Grisham novel I read was 'The King of Torts', which was much better in terms of its characters, subject as well as the development of the story.
B000003S0P|5.0|It was 1974, and the ever-rotating line-up that called itself King Crimson was collapsing...again. The band had already fallen apart and reformed two or three times before this album was recorded, and on Red, King Crimson was reduced to a trio. Guitarist Robert Fripp, drummer Bill Bruford, and bassist/vocalist John Wetton created most of this music, along with a few guest musicians.    \\"Red\\" is the first song on the album, and is constructed wonderfully. Heavy, menacing, dramatic; it was King Crimson at its finest. The six-minute instrumental finally gives way to \\"Fallen Angel,\\" a vocal piece that manages to sound just as epic as \\"Red,\\" complete with startling contrasts between light and darker, heavier moments. The beginning is rather subdued, but the chorus introduces some droning guitars and saxophones, and \\"Fallen Angel\\" is one of the strongest moments on the album. \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" feels like a weird, distorted, but upbeat take on the title track, utilizing a dented cymbal to mimic handclaps. It features some of Fripp's best arrangement tricks, as well as some truly interesting lyrics, that, indeed, chronicle one distressing nightmare. \\"Providence\\" is the second instrumental, but it is very different than \\"Red.\\" Comprised mainly of improvisation, \\"Providence\\" is interesting, but it just isn't a song I can listen to often. \\"Starless,\\" the epic closer, is a rewrite of the title track to this album's predecessor - Starless and Bible Black. In my opinion, it is superior to that song, containing one of the most haunting openings to any King Crimson song, ever. It is notable for having perhaps the finest John Wetton vocal performance for the band - maybe for his entire career. Following the vocal section, the band moves into a more experimental portion - droning guitars that keep reaching ever upward - that eventually resolves into one of the best King Crimson album closings ever.      Being a King Crimson fan, I can say that this is one of their finest albums. Perhaps newcomers should listen to this album. My personal introduction to the band was their debut, and I still recommend listening to that first, but Red isn't a bad choice. The truth is, it's stunning that this album exists at all. As it was being recorded, the band was imploding, yet the album can be considered one of their finest efforts. Red turned out to be bandleader Robert Fripp's final ideas for the dying band, and ultimately, it's heavier and noisier than some expected from King Crimson. Although their next phase (beginning with Discipline, continuing through Beat, and ending with Three of a Perfect Pair) was equally brilliant, this remains the closing work from Crimson Mark II (or is it III? Who can keep track?), and it's incredible stuff.
0316172324|2.0|If you consider yourself an intellectual (you know who you are...Matrix is your favorite movie) you will appreciate reading this book. Thereafter, you will commit the anecdotal experiments to memory and will shamelessly flaunt them at wine tastings.  <br /> <br />The author introduces the concept of thin-slicing beyond the delicatessen. He also informs the reader that snap judgments are not merely relegated to NFL quarterbacks.
0156027321|3.0|Smart and inventive, the book is both fun and thought-provoking.  And yet it is not perfect.  It's actually more like two books, which never really come together for the reader.  The themes developed in the first section (really the first quarter or so of the book), notably the protagonist's religious interests, never get played out in the second.  Still, it's certainly an enjoyable read.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|If anyone says that this album compares to Walking the Fallen, they are completely deaf. I have never been more excited for an album release and now I have never been more disappointed in an album release. No band today is, or should I say was, as good at creating a song that is a complete masterpiece as A7X. Not one single song on this album has the emotional outbursts, deep lyrics, mood shifts, vocal intensity, or melodic phrases that all previous A7X songs have. This is where you would normally crtique specific songs on the album or point out exactly what is wrong with the album, but this disc goes in one ear and out the other. There is nothing that remains in my head for 10 seconds so that I can comment on it. Please do not buy this cd. Warner Brothers can shove this you know where.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I give X & Y a \\"C.\\"  I've listened to it numerous times now.  It's my least favorite CD from them.  Every track is forgettable, extremely ho-hum.  With all honesty, I think these guys have way more potential and for some strange reason they're being held back.  Take older tracks Like \\"Bigger Stronger,\\" \\"Where is My Boy?\\" and \\"Your Love Means Everything Part 2.\\"  This is the Coldplay I love.      Don't get me wrong...they're talented as !@$% and put on one hell of a live performance.     Just my two and 3/4 cents.  Oh!...and two stars maybe a little too harsh.  I'd give it 3.    See you all on Aug. 19th at Shoreline.
B00000JPYD|5.0|I first heard Bridge of Sighs a few years after its release, maybe around 1976 --- Sophmore year of High School. I recall being entranced by Trower's guitar, Dewar's thumping bass and soulful vocals --- but equally by Isidore's thundering drumming. (approximating Bonham's Zep style).  <br /> <br />I wore my vinyl out back in the mid-late 70s and into the 80s, then unfortunately, my albums found their way into boxes, when replaced by CDs.  It took me until the mid 90s to revisit this rock masterpiece. <br /> <br />The improvisational style of \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\" and the eerie, melodic sensations of \\"Bridge of Sighs/In This Place\\" and \\"About to Begin\\" are the album's best moments, in my opinion. This is must for any serious fan of 70s blues/rock --- especially if you are a fan of driving trios. One anecdote --- saw Robin Trower in N.O. (at a place called Jimmy's) in the late 80s.  Concert was on a Friday night and my ears were still ringing the following Tuesday! <br /> <br />Buy this CD now....prepare for a musical blitzkrieg!!  <br />
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I watched this movie with my boyfriend, and we could carry a conversation simply based on the little details of the movie. I can't help but to fall in love with all the characters (for their no-nonsense performance). Natalie Portman totally deserved her golden globe~<br />Carol
0553106635|5.0|Finally a fantasy author who is not afraid to pull any punches with his audience.  This book really gets a bad rep from some fans and it should not GRRM world is not a world of lollypops and gum drops people can die in these books.  Its sad for all of us because feelings for the characters have been developed over time even for the minor ones.  The more I reread the books the more I realize that the deaths were nessicary for the continuation of the story.  Also the fact that characters can die is welcome change from the vast majority of fantasy literature where protagonists seems to be able to kill and maim legions of foes without apparent harm to themselves.  I loved the book even though I was sad to see some of the characters go. And that is the bare bones of the matter isn't it?  Only GRRM could make me care about the characters the way I do.  I find it strange sometimes I love the main POV characters and hate their supporting cast, other times I hate the main POV character and love their supporting cast.    <br /> <br />Overall-Its all still here the back story, the humor, plus the character development of all characters.  People may just be a little dissatisfied with the ending which is after all their right as a member of the reading public.  Just remember that plotlines and stories are not done by popular vote this is GRRM's creative work.  While I may be distressed about some of the conclusions I have every confidence that he is taking us where we want to go in the end.  Now that the publication date of A Feast for Crows is definite I can hardly wait.   <br />
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|This big Hollywood remake of a small Japanese sleeper is going to get knocked around the dance floor by those who have seen the 1995 original which, to be fair, is better. But this one isn't half bad. In the original, a bored Japanese accountant courting a midlife crisis takes ballroom dancing lessons and enters a competition. In the remake, so does a Chicago attorney (Richard Gere). His wife (Susan Sarandon) hires a private detective because she suspects he's having an affair.    So why doesn't he simply tell her? Dancing is not yet criminal or shameful in Bush's America. The secretiveness worked in the original because the Japanese are wary of public physical contact. At the end, Gere tells Sarandon that, although he loves her and is happy, he didn't want to hurt her by admitting that dancing makes him happier. Uh-huh. Once you accept this tortured logic you might be able to enjoy all the stereotying, glamorizing and self-aware acting on abundant display.    Gere has played so many movie lawyers (he played another dancing one in \\"Chicago\\") he could play them in his sleep, but he seems awake to the character here; surely this good actor has passed the bar by now. Jennifer Lopez, as his teacher, dances gracefully and mercifully is not called upon to act, which allows her character a certain mysterious distance called for in the script. Stanley Tucci is a frenzied delight as an office drone with Gene Kelly genes.     If you were among the few thousand who saw the original, superior in every way, don't watch this DVD (with its entertaining extras) or spoil the story (with its small surprises) for the millions who haven't.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I get the feeling that Dream Theater has lost a lot of their charisma.  This used to be a band that was unpredictable, and every member seemed to be climbing over each other to be the most talented, trading solos and throroughly exploring progressive metal.  While this new disc displays a much more mature band with a powerful, united sound, it's not nearly as much fun as their older, wilder, technically impressive discs.   <br /> <br />For the record, I loved Train of Thought, but thought there were some real duds.  As I Am and In the Name of God were very below average.  They did, however, have jaw dropping solos.  Octoavarium doesn't have any songs that are quite as bad as those two tracks, but they are all practically devoid of jaw-dropping moments, and that is always what has made Dream Theater stand out to me.  They are adventurous, and hugely talented.  There are many well-crafted songs in the rock/pop section at my local Wal-Mart, but I seek out Dream Theater not for good songs but for outstanding musicianship.  Sure, it's obnoxious to have your abilities on display ALL the time, but it worked for Images and Words, didn't it? <br /> <br />I know this seems very negative right now, as I am a longtime fan of DT and, like all fans, I am probably too hard to please.  I gave this disc four stars instead of the two or three I was planning to give it, and it's not because I \\"plan to grow into it\\" (which I do) or because \\"they're still better than most other bands out there\\" (which they are).  It's because of the title track, Octavarium. <br /> <br />Basically, everything I have said so far does not apply to the 24 minute epic that finishes this CD.  In short, the entire song is excatly where I would like Dream Theater to progress to, as it is perfect from start to finish.  I'm not going to ruin anything for people who haven't heard this disc yet, but let me just make a suggestion:  put on some comfy headphones and sit this one straight through.  I bet you'll enjoy yourself.  I would like to nominate it as one of the top 3 best Dream Theater songs ever. <br /> <br />So they still have it in them... why aren't they more enthusiastic about it?
B000063DIH|5.0|This CD was given to me from a friend who found out I was a maiden fan.  After listening to it, I was in maiden heaven again thanking God there was still some metal around rather than just all grunge. <br /> <br />I really fell in step with \\"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\\" and \\"Fear of the Dark\\".  I thought, wow, maiden tryin to do a slow-down tune and when I heard the guitar lead on \\"afraid to shoot strangers\\", i was hooked.  My Wife never heard of Maiden (blesphamy) but when she heard that guitar lead, she fell for it too.   <br /> <br />I enjoy all of the songs on this CD and is rated up there with Powerslave, Somewhere In Time and Piece of Mind, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Thank goodness Iron Maiden never faded like the \\"hair\\" bands of the 80's! <br /> <br />UP THE IRONS!
B0002Y4TZG|4.0|Not much to say about this one, bought it when it first came out, thought it ripped. I dropped away from the Clash after the Sandinista triple album turning to stuff like GBH and the Exploited....  But got a copy of the 25th anniversary edition of London Calling and am happy with it.  It is good value, the original album is still what it always was, the transition from vinyl to CD is fine, but there is no change from what has been available on CD for years, the extra music CD from the Vanilla studio rehearsals are well worth having if you are interested in the development of tracks on the original album, but most of this has been around for a while so nothing new there and the DVD is just a bit of icing on the $$$ value cake because there is about 2 hours of material - none of it particularly original but there is a stack of stuff.  There are three bonus DVD tracks and the live version of  - Clampdown - just puts a huge smile on my face, about midway through something just clicks and you can just see how much the boys are getting into it, look out for that; but none of its new.  All the Paul Simonon stuff on the DVD interview is great to see - the man is still ice cool.  Joe Strummer's head is priceless(RIP), Mick Jones's teeth are even more priceless and Topper's recovering Junkie look, well... priceless.  If I was to indulge myself and list my picks off the original album - Clampdown, The Guns of Brixton, Wrong `Em Boyo, Death or Glory, The Card Cheat, I'm Not Down and of course Revolution Rock.  I would be hard pressed to pick between any of the above tracks, but then Spanish Bombs is perhaps a favorite for content - a nice tribute to the Spanish Anarchists and particularly the Spanish poet Federico Lorca who was executed by the fascists in 1937.   In any case this one IS worth what you pay, so long as you are not expecting to find anything NEW on it, I suppose what you get is a lot of stuff you have already heard or seen but just packaged up in one box - you have to decide for your self if that is worth paying for, I did not mind.  If you have never owned a copy of London Calling then..... You suck... and I am not talking to you in any of the above, you just need to get a copy, does not matter if it's this one or the cheaper CD version that is also available; `cause it was, and is, a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Phil <br />
B0009I7NNA|3.0|I understand my stars say three, but I would like to have them say four, even close to five (4.25 or 4.5)    After listening to this cd all the way through, I can honestly say my opinion of it has changed.    First and foremost, if you enjoyed A7X for their screaming sound mixed with melodic singing, you might be dissapointed. Whether or not you believe the rumor about M. Shadows' vocal surgery is up to you, but it is true he does not scream on this album. I have heard one growl in the beginning of 'The Beast and the Harlot' and a couple of other long yells. (By the way, pick up the new Revolver. There is an article in there about A7X where they said 'we were getting tired of being put into the metalcore genre. We used to scream when we were kids, but we're not anymore' These are not EXACT words, but it gives you an idea of why they don't scream) M.Shadows' singing is still good. There are instances where tones sound forced and off, but overall he sounds excellent.    If you enjoyed A7X for the MUSIC, you will not (or I atleast hope you won't) be dissapointed. From the very first track, the trademark double guitars, double bass drums, fast-paced brutality of A7X is present. A7X even adds in spanish guitar influences, strings, and a choir for some of the songs. The spanish guitar is beautiful and the choir and strings are haunting.    Lyrically, this album is kind of weak. Some of the lines are cheesy, not formulated well, or just don't seem to fit A7X. This seems to be the only thing keeping me from giving it a five.    Give the tracks a listen. As I said, they have a media player with ALL of the songs for listening. Formulate your own opinion before buying.
B00004BZ0V|3.0|Okay, so this is just a money spinner and a milk cow.  Just about all of the tracks are great, but that's because they are from a great band.  If you own the first four Clash albums then you have the best tracks off this one - with the exception of Bankrobber, AKA Robber Dub, which is a favorite of mine and it is worth having this version of that track.  I did not particularly like Combat Rock and so I take or leave the tracks off that Album.  But if you're the sort of person who does not really want to pay the money to have the original albums and you just want to cut the nuts out of a great band missing heaps of their best tracks on the way then this one is for you....and you suck.  Really if you already own `The Clash', `Give em enough Rope', `London Calling' and `Sandinista' there is no real reason to buy this, if you do not own the above albums then you are probably better off buying one of them then this one.  If all you want is a 'taste' then that's...'Hateful'. The three star rating I gave this is mainly due to the fact that its The Clash and has very little to do with this release, but I do note that it is perhaps worth having the Bankrobber track (11). <br /> <br />Phil
B0007INZXO|4.0|THIS ALBUM IS DESTINED TO BECOME A CLASSIC BY ALL STANDARDS. I SHOULD IN RETROSPECT HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS BUT 5 STAR ALBUMS ONLY HAPPEN ONCE IN A LONG WHILE.  THESE BOYS DESERVE MORE ACCOLADES THAN THEY RECEIVE.  CHRIS MARTIN'S ABILITY TO WRITE SONGS IS ALMOST SUPERNATURAL.  THERE ARE MANY INFLUENCES ON THIS ALBUM MOST NOTABLY BOWIE'S HEROES ERA, AND ABBEY ROAD GUITAR RIFFS, AND ALSO A BEATY LITTLE NUMBER THAT REMINDS ONE OF <br />NEW ORDER. I LOVED IT. AND SO WILL YOU <br />PEACE TO ALL <br />JOHN
B00008J4P5|1.0|So you really think that all those music critics at 'Rolling Stone' and 'Spin' know about music? Do you really think that The White Stripes will become the next musical phenomenon of this generation? Hell no, that will never happen. The White Stripes for the most part have no appeal whatsoever, and they're still miles away from becoming as big as music \\"experts\\" think they are.
B000089RVX|3.0|I like Amy Lee's voice. It's a nice addition to contemporary gothic music. I don't mind sad songs, and I can ignore the occasional suicide song. However, many of these songs can be construde as suicidle. Although she's says she has nothing to do with Christianity-I'm sure she doesn't- she still asks Christ to save her after she slashed her own wrist. This is not child appropriate so be careful. On the other hand, I still listen to Evanesence ocassionally. Although the music is rather slow moving. Immortal is rather good, and not all of her songs are about suicide. I don't know I guess I still like it.
B0007GAERG|3.0|My favourite song on the album is Mine Again because it really showcases her voice.  I am a very big fan favourite of her 90's albums.  Mariah has an extraordinary talent, but I feel her best work is still behind her.  That's when she really showed us all what she could do with her voice.  Did you know she can sing 8 octaves, making her voice sound like a whistle?  Come on Mariah!  Show us what you've got!
B0006J28BO|3.0|Fans of Miyazaki-san and Studio Ghibli will appreciate this release, even though, once again, the Guardians of American Culture at Disney have tinkered with the dialog and plot line to suit their agenda. The release seems ham-handed and rushed.<br /><br />Quite annoying and unforgivable is the use of so-called \\"dubtitles\\" to accompany the Japanese dialog. Thus we get the altered meanings, extra conversational clutter and hip dialog revisions of the English dub, instead of a literal translation of the Japanese script. Why no true subtitles? Probably a budgetary/profit margin decision.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not too bad, even though, as other reviewers have noted, the release to the N. American market suffers from lack of antecedent -- just who is The Cat, and why should we be excited at his return? Return from where, exactly?<br /><br />2012 update: okay, I see now that The Cat's Repayment is a more accurate translation of the Japanese original title, which reaffirms anyway that the English title is still misleading and confusing, if not illiterate.
1591396190|5.0|This breakthrough book provides an organized framework for identifying and implementing out-of-the-box \\"blue ocean strategies\\" in all industries. The blue ocean strategy explains how to sail your business into new markets with less competition and greater profitability. Disarmingly written by W. Chan Kim and Ren&eacute;e Mauborgne, the book is energized with fresh research about the impact of innovative ideas on old industries. The compelling business examples alone are worth taking this cruise. Even the appendices make interesting reading and contain more detailed examples about products ranging from the Model T to movie theaters (the authors explain how innovators reinvented theaters and created their own blue ocean phenomena). While the book provides its share of rules and principles for intrepid strategists to follow, complete with its own jargon, managers easily can navigate right to the authors' key strategic advice. We consider this book essential for any strategist or entrepreneur who wants to move out of intensively competitive shark-infested waters and into the relative tranquility of the open blue ocean. Getting there isn't risk-free, but great adventure awaits the intrepid executive who makes the voyage.
B000002JPA|5.0|Nuff said is right- this is the best prog CD- MUST OWN
B0009OPO0S|5.0|Shakira has done it again! This album contains many beautiful songs that show off how talented and unique a singer Shakira is. I think this album is a bit more mellow than her previous ones, with the exception of La Tortura and a few others, but it's still amazing nonetheless...
B00005B534|4.0|I was expecting a real major breakthrough after reading so many favorable reviews. However, I honestly couldn't find anything absolutely original here, except for the highly complex drum structures. To me, the album sounded almost identical to Symphony X, but without soul, melody and musical texture characteristic in the prog/power metal genre.  <br /> <br />Overall, I rate this 9.5/10 for overall musicianship (drummer Dirk Bruinenberg gets 10+!), but only 7/10 for composition and originality. Good music is not about how many notes you can play at a time.  <br /> <br />David Readman's voice is flat. The guitar sound is almost a copy of Yngwie's, although Stephen Forte's composing abilities are much better than Malmsteen's. Remember: the best lead guitar solos are the ones one can sing along with. Lastly, the keyboards sound totally computer generated, fake and without feel.  <br /> <br />Something very unique about Sanctus Ignis is the spectacular performance of drummer Dirk Bruinenberg (Elegy / Consortium Project). I mean, how can anybody come up with those thunderous and imaginative double bass beats, is beyond me. The fast tempos are often offset by beautifully crafted slower patterns. Bruinenberg's drum lick repertoire and odd timing bag of tricks is endless. Nevertheless, his best stuff can be heard with Elegy, not here. Elegy to me is (was?) a much better band.  <br /> <br />Most reviews here highlight Forte's guitar performance. However --for a change-- it is very important to acknowledge the astonishing level of drumming accomplished by Bruinenberg. This album is a must for any drummer or musician willing to learn how to push the envelope into un-chartered territory. Get his stuff from Elegy (sadly, a very underrated band)... their music is in a league of their own and much better than Adagio's
B0006L16N8|1.0|I was curious what all the hype about Coldplay's new album was about, and having enjoyed \\"Clocks,\\" I suspected there might be some substance to back up the hype.   Boy was I wrong!!!  Poor Chris Martin.....life with Gwyneth and little Apple must be so hard....give me a freakin' break!  Thanks for the postcards from the center of Chris Martin's universe...glad to know it still revolves around him.  It seems to me from the lyrics that the band has gone soft in the head, and is so self absorbed, they actually think people what to hear the same \\"woe is me\\" lyrics over and over again.  The last thing I want to hear from Coldplay is 13 songs about how crappy their lives are set to music borrowed from 80's college radio.  Absolutely nothing of value here except a poor knock-off of Bono's nasally falsetto.   Save your money!  I'd have a hard time thinking of something that could possibly be more over-hyped than this album, but then I noticed how heavily they are pushing the supporting concert tour.   Good luck filling those seats guys!  People follow U2 because of their political statements and good music, not because we're especially interested in the problems in Bono's life.  I suspect by the end of the \\"Twisted Logic\\" tour, people will be asking \\"which band is Coldplay again?\\"    From all the hype, I was expecting an musical event like \\"Thriller,\\" \\"Joshua Tree,\\" \\"Welcome To The Jungle,\\" \\"Nevermind,\\" or \\"Under The Table and Dreaming.\\"  A few days of listening is enough to tell this album clearly doesn't have a place in that rarified company. My point would be that this very well could be Coldplay's best album, but saying that, and saying this album is an ephocal event, or will be an \\"essential\\" disc are two completely different things.  The album simply doesn't live up to the hype.
B0007XT87G|5.0|The Good  <br />The title track \\"Deadwing\\" clocks in at nine minutes. Porcupine Tree builds anticipation with an electronic pulsing beat that gives way to pounding drums and thick guitar licks. Just when you think the track is winding down, it comes back at you with a killer guitar soloing. Guitarist/vocalist Steven Wilson must have been taking notes during his production sessions with Opeth, because the riffs on \\"Shallow\\" are pure heavy metal. They mix well with the clean interludes. Wilson's vocals are echoed, yet melodic. With the blending of acoustic guitars and piano on \\"Lazarus\\", it seems that Steven had some left over material from his Blackfield side project.  <br /> <br />The song evokes plenty of emotion and sincerity. Porcupine Tree flex their artsy progressive side on \\"Arriving Somewhere (But Not Here)\\". The effects heavy, indulgent introduction guides you to Wilson's serene vocals and acoustic guitar work. About half way through this twelve minute piece, they kick up the distortion with chunky riffs and a driving drum beat instrumental. As soon as the band pumps you up, they bring you right back down. The hidden track is built around watery guitar tones; wah injected licks, and harmonized vocals.  <br /> <br />The Bad  <br />Nothing  <br /> <br />The Verdict  <br />Porcupine Tree cannot be defined by one genre due to their vast textures of music. This is evident after listening to their latest album. Deadwing shows that Porcupine Tree doesn't just rock you; they calm you, and take you on a thought-provoking journey as well.  <br />
0345457684|4.0|When looking at sci-fi, don't we always wnat to know how technology will effect the immortality of humans? We all search for ways of leaving a legacy, because at a certain time in our lives we begin to feel the weight of the finite life-span. The film BLADE RUNNER explores this issue best with an accelerated construct for the Nexus 6 androids -- and we sympathieze.<br /><br />ALTERED CARBON comes up with an ingenious method of answer  \\"do you want to live forever?\\" (my favorite line for the film CONAN) - transfering consciousness directly into digital info -- that can be swapped in and out of bodies like you swap CDs in your laptop.<br /><br />Morgan's prose is strong, the characters are psychologically interesting, the sci-fi violence is repellent, yet gripping, and the storyline continues to twist and turn until the final pages. It's filled with great little curios for the day-to-day life in the world he creates, but it also has major upgrades (or downgrades) for the far-reaching elments of a future society.<br /><br />Takashi Kovacs is a mean bastard, but you feel for his plight, his situation, his anger, his passion -- he's real enough in his decisions that you forgive him for some the atroscities he commits to \\"solve the case.\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00006SFBD|4.0|This is a FINE Opeth CD- Heck, what Opeth CD isnt? This Cd gives you a lot of diversity- heavy, and soft- If your new to Opeth, Start Here!!! GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!OPeth ROCKS
B0006L16N8|3.0|Coldplay always seemed to find chords and spaces that so many bands failed to capture.  This album is reminiscient of another recent dud from a 'supergroup', that of U2.  There are moments when you listen to the radio, or someone plays a CD in a car and a melody hits you.  You say \\"What was that??\\"  Unfortunately, there are no such transitions or musical moments in *X&Y*. <br /> <br />A Rush of Blood to the Head has these magical moments somewhere in each song.  The single EPs also had them.  \\"I Ran Away\\", \\"Animals\\", \\"One I Love\\"; all songs that weren't good enough to make it on *Rush*, all surpass the forced greatness of *X&Y*. <br /> <br />Say it ain't so, Coldplay.  Where did the melodies run to?
B0009A1AS2|4.0|1st let me say that this is a much deeper, and 'proggier' album than TOT- much, much more diverse, hence, better. A few gripes if I may;  1st track- 4/4 blah- with a reference to \\"This Dying Soul\\"- a horrible song in my opinion- DT, if your going to refer back to previous songs, do something from Awake or Images!! This song is pretty boring for an opening song- nothing original, or groundbreaking. Why are they starting to refer to other songs anyways? Prog music is about having songs THAT DONT sound like one-another.  2nd track- zzzzzzz. (and I like ballads too)not to mention cliched lyrics- note to Petrucci, take lessons on how to write some Lyrics!!!!! See Neil Pert on that one. Anyway- boring music-CLICHE lyrics.   - Well, the rest of thre album is SOLID!! Well, one other gripe, On the track SACRIFICED SONS, note to DT, when singing a song about our fallen brothers refrain from jamming. This is a time for a nice ballad. Jamming, and talking about the towers falling creates an odd Juxtaposition.   Great Album overall- they are back!!!! 4 stars is perfect for this album- no more, no less
0440180295|2.0|The horrors of war have unhinged many a man, Vonegut's Billy Pilgrim being one of the more famous of them.  It takes no great insight to grasp that war is awful almost beyond human understanding and that participating in it, or merely witnessing it, can crack someone's sanity.  Billy Pilgrim can't stop reliving his trauma. His time-tripping is an unconcious attempt to escape that trauma.  Goofy looking aliens tell him to think of the positve things in his life. It never works.  He goes tripping back to Dresden at random times in his life, and trips back to his life at random times while he's in Dresden. I don't understand why this novel ever rose to the status of a classic.  There are much better anti-war books ( Johnny Got His Gun ); there are much better science fiction books ( too numerous to mention ); there are much better anti-war science fiction books ( The Forever War, The Stars My Destination ).  The only pluses I can give this book are Vonnegut's style ( crisp, succinct and in plain English ) and its relative brevity. Get it from the library ( don't waste your cash ) and read it just so you can argue intelligently when someone tells you how great a book it is.
B00004YX0R|4.0|No doubt quite good interpretations. They are non the less also some of the most peculiar. That is perhaps partly due to the engineering, the ambience of the sound, but also to the playing style. This quartet sounds different from all other quartets I have ever heard. The bow on the strings often sounds very ugly, like somebody filing some metal. It is something feverish about it, at the same time something frail. It makes me think of sunshine stinging in the eyes. Suffice it to say that it is nothing fleshy about the sound of this quartet. Tempos are mostly brisk, the touch is light - in spite of the filing sound, which also can be described as a thin, withered, squeaky sound. Summa summarum: This quartet gives a so peculiar atmosphere to the Beethoven quartets that it is no point in comparing to other quartets, just as summer cannot feel like winter. This is summer. Summer heat, sultry, close, smoky, of barbeque or rubbish fire of withered leaves... I feel that these recordings are quite aristocratic, of very good taste, delicate, intimate. This has nothing to do with \\"old world\\", as both the Alban Berg quartet and Quartetto Italiano are (were?) \\"old world\\" and yet a far cry from Talich. I love to have this one in my collection, because it gives something not any other quartet gives.   Not my first choice, however, I would rather go for Takacs (op. 18), Takacs or Tokyo (middle quartets). To me, Tokyo rules when it comes to the late quartets, but that's me. I guess most people will prefer the Takacs quartet all the way, with the exception of the Quartetto Italiano congregation. Talich is something special, but very good as such.
B0002KQNZO|5.0|Bursting at the seams with originality, passion, and fury, Art Blakey's \\"Free for All\\" is a textbook example of how hard bop jazz is done. The title track of this 1964 masterpiece is an 11 minute wonder: Wayne Shorter's blazing sax, Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, and Blakey himself doing the most amazing drum solo that will leave you speechless. The fun only begins here. The band also tears it up on \\"Pensativa\\" and the upbeat \\"The Core,\\" whose interplay between Shorter, bass player Reggie Workman, and leader Blakey makes the track work so well. Throughout the album, you can feel and hear the harmony between all players, each of whom holds his own respectably. If you've never heard of Blakey, this CD will instantly turn you into a convert. One of the greatest recordings--jazz or otherwise--ever made. It gets my highest recommendation.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|This film is a great action movie hands down.  no arguments.  But another great thing about it is that the story and plot are rich and thick.  I love when films like these use religion correctly to create a good story line.  I myself am a fan of the Exorcist movies and Religious movies like those are good dark scary fun.
B00011RPB0|2.0|Maybe its me, but i settled down to watch this with a lass 12 years my senior, hoping to be entertained and captured by this film, which many have raved about. Instead, frankly, i was bored senseless.<br /><br />Nothing at all grabbed my interest. I neither empathised nor sympathised with the characters, and the only thing that kept me to the end of the film is that i'd made a big deal of it myself to my companion, based on the media coverage and reviews.<br /><br />The story can be covered with a hugely brief synopsis. Two people, of different age-groups and sexes, in Tokyo although not really wanting to be there, are drawn to each other via the hotels bar, and become friends, both feeling gladness at the others uncomfortableness in this culture so different to what they are used to.<br /><br />And thats about it really. \\"Dull\\" doesnt seem to be a strong enough word, but perhaps i over anticipated due to the hype, so i am restraining myself from using the word \\"drivel\\" instead.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Absolutely horrible! I'm almost speechless. To think they spent three years putting the album together and their fans waited for *this*. It's mediocre at best, nothing groundbreaking, but wait, they never were groundbreaking. Chris Martin's voice is just whiny and all-around bad. \\"Fix You\\" is the album's only redemming song, but the rest of the tracks are the same stuff you can hear from a million other bands out there on the radio today. \\"Low\\" sounds like a cheesey 80's dance track. <br /> <br />God, this used to be a good band. Maybe they already composed all the good music they're capable of...
B0006399FS|1.0|What ever happened to U2? they sold out. <br />\\"All that you can't leave behind\\" was not half of a bad album, although it was a bit poppy with \\"Stuck in a moment\\" and \\"Beautifull daY\\". <br /> <br />Whats happening to music these days?
B00097A5HW|5.0|This album is another prove of why shakira is without any doubts the most talented female singer in the latin music spectrum.<br /><br />This record shows shakira experimening with different styles of music, including intelligent pop, rock and bossa nova, and that's more and most exiting than the music that is being made any other female star in the spanish music market.<br /><br />Very recommended are tracks 5 - \\"No\\" & 7 - \\"Un Dia especial\\", in wich Gustavo Cerati sounds more like Soda Stereo than in any of his own albums. Track 11 \\"La Pared (acosutic)\\" its a joy to listen to and shows the very best of Shakiras voice.<br /><br />So, this is an album that everyone should listen, both spanish and english listeners, because its full of surprises and they are all good, enjoy this album and wait until november for Vol 2.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This band stopped being cool when \\"Good Riddance\\" became all the rage as nice pop little pop song. <br />
B00097A5I6|4.0|The same criticisms have been and will always be thrown at Oasis...Noel is a rip off artist, all their songs lumber along at the same 4/4 pace, etc etc.  However those willing to still listen will find a strong, concise album here, the bands strongest since (What's The Story) Morning Glory?.  There are no Wonderwalls or Supersonics, but it is unreasonable to expect that from a band at this stage in their career.  Songs like \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" and \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" are excellent right from the first listen, and for the first time in a while there is no half hearted filler, with each song being deserving of a place.   <br />If you ever have been a fan of the band then this is definitely worth a go, and given the chance this may even turn some doubters.
B00097A5I6|1.0|Its about time Liam Gallaghar stopped blagging, and Noel Gallaghar stopped praising the albums each time they are released as their best, or second best.<br /><br />Although he does throw alot of insults at \\"Be Here Now\\" the bands much anticipated album that apprently dissapointed everyone, and while containing no classics like \\"Wonderwall\\" it is still a triumphant album.<br /><br />Following that was \\"Standing on the shoulder of giants\\" no sell out of an album, a handfull of pretty good songs, but still fell short.<br /><br />The in 2002 they released \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" containing some of the first real Oasis classics since whast the story morning glory, and seemed to reinstall faith in the band for many and bring them new fans after beleiving they were a phenomena that had been and gone.<br /><br />So this album was suspected to be the big return, to the \\"classic\\" Oasis, writing great rock n roll music, and Heathen Chemistry showed that they were about to and had got themselves into gear.<br /><br />Things have changed for the wrost.<br /><br />\\"Don't Beleive the truth\\" is by far the worst album ever released by oasis, and does'nt remotley sound like Oasis, more like a 1960s tribute old rock n roll record.<br /><br />Everything about it is bad, the music, the singing, the lyrics, the production - it would be fair to say that this is the biggest dissapointment in the history of music.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|Let me first start this review out by saying that I am a huge Dream Theater fan, seeing them 5 times in concert. I enjoyed 6 degrees of inner turbulance, I learned to love Train of Thought, but this album is a let down. It seems like all of these songs were just bland. Nothing really stands out on this cd. I'm giving it three stars because it is Dream Theater, and even on their worst effort, it's still better than all of the crap on the radio these days. The reason I don't like this album is because Dream Theater is trying to sound like too many other bands and not enough of themselves through the whole thing. I'll go track by track to explain myself: <br /> <br />1) The Root of All Evil: This is Dream Theater trying to be themselves, but it falls short. The Glass Prison and This Dying Soul were the first two of Mike Portnoy's 9 step song program, and it seems that with each song, they get worse. The main problem with this song is that it is too repetitive. <br /> <br />2) The Answers Are Within: Dream Theater trying to be _insert hair metal band here_ with their power ballad. This song sucks flat out. No emotion, forced feeling, and James LaBrie's voice is the thing that really bothers me about this song. This is Anna Lee bad from Falling Into Infinity. <br /> <br />3) These Walls: Dream Theater trying to be Pain of Salvation. The band pulls it off, but again, the singing is terrible. No matter how hard he tries, James LaBrie will never sound as good as Daniel Gildenlow. This is an alright song, but the influence is blatent. <br /> <br />4) I Walk Beside You: Dream Theater trying to be U2. I don't like U2, but this song is ok. I like the singing on here, but the rest of the band sounds cheesy. No real feeling in this either.  <br /> <br />5) Panic Attack: Dream Theater trying to be Opeth without death vocals and more lead guitar. Opeth is one of my favorite bands so this isnt too bad either. This also sounds very similar to Pain of Salvation again. This is the bestsong on the CD. This song is why this review has 3 stars.  <br /> <br />6) Never Enough: Dream Theater trying to be Muse and the Mars Volta influence is strong on this one. This is the filler track on the album. I have heard the whole album through half a dozen times and I could not remember this track while I was writing this. 2nd worst song on the album behind The Answer Lies Within. <br /> <br />7) Sacrifced Sons: Dream Theater trying to be themselves again. This is The Great Debate all over again. The Great Debate was a pretty big rip-off of tool, but it had enough Dream Theater in it to save the song. This song has what has become of Dream Theater, lack of interseting lyrics, and unfortunitly, lack of musical diversity to satisfy my tastes. The solos and drum fills have all been done before. The first time I heard them, they were awe-inspiring, but now it is just rehashed material done over a remake of one of my favorite tracks.  <br /> <br />8) Octavarium: Dream Theater trying to be Porcupine Tree/Symphony X. After seeing that there was going to be a 24 minute epic on this cd, I was expecting a lot. This is no Change of Seasons. This is a dull, boring track that misses all of the elements that make the bands they are stealing from great. The Porcupine Tree influence is in the begining when the sound texture rolls over the listener, but what it is missing is the feeling and the point of it. The Symphony X influence at the end of the song is strong in the orchestral arrangements and the double bass, but it is missing the songwriting and classical guitar lines that are in the forefront of Symphony X. This song is also missing Russell Allen's vocals. This track was the biggest let down of the entire album. <br /> <br />I do like this album despite the negative things I have said about it. The problem I have with it is that it is not up to the high standards I keep Dream Theater at. I like most of the \\"influences\\" they have included throughout the album so it wasinteresting to hear Dream Theater playing that style, but it didn't always work and that's where the album suffers.  <br /> <br />If you want to get a true progressive gem that came out this year, get Porcupine Tree's latest \\"Dead Wing\\" or the new Opeth cd when it comes out. Get this is you are a collector, but stick with Images and Words and Awake for the real enjoyable records.  <br /> <br />Those are my thoughts and remember I am entitled to my opinion so think for yourself, but this is how I feel about this record. A Three Star performance from a Five Star band. <br /> <br />-Andrew
B0006L16N8|4.0|It has been a couple of years since Coldplay's second album \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" hit the stores, and boy did it go down a treat, selling over 10 million copies world wide. Their recent release entitled: \\"X and Y\\" sees the band losing their distinctly raw sound featured in some of their previous hits such as \\"Yellow\\" and \\"In My Place\\". This is not neccsarily a bad think however as they still manage to encapsulate their trademark emotion into this album while also blending in a more complex, modern sound (and even techno in some parts).     Now, On to the actual songs...(I'll opt for the easy way and just do the review on a song by song basis)     Square One: Square One: An eerie, spacey type sound opens this song (and the album) up. Chris Martin's vocals drift in...     \\"You're in control, is their anywhere you wanna go?     This slow start soon gives way too a pounding, techno flavored beat that immediately lets you know this is no \\"Parachutes\\". It is a catchy, effective opening song,     What If: a great vocal performance by Martin is present here, although the lyrics are somewhat \\"Dr Seuss like\\" in terms of the rhyming scheme (not the content!) which degrades an otherwise beautiful, touching song.     White Shadows: A confident, thudding, techno beat greets us on this track. It reminds me of the b-side \\"Things I Don't Understand\\". Not one of my favourites, but by no means a bad inclusion.       Fix You: This song features one of the most memorable endings in the Coldplay's song repitua. Every time I hear the line towards the end:\\" Tears stream down your face, When you lose something you know you can't replace\\", I shiver with emotion, it really is something.     Talk: The guitar playing just does not work on this song; it sounds out of place as well as annoying. The lyrics are pretty corny as well. This song is filler.     X And Y: The previous blunder is quickly redeemed by this classic. The chorus is just stunning. And the lyrics are equally beautiful:\\"You and me are floating on a tidal wave....Togeeeeetheeeerrrr\\"   \\"You and me are drifting into outta space\\"     This song is trademark Coldplay, and should make for an excellent second single.     Next we have Speed Of Sound: The bands single release. It is very reminicient of \\"Clocks\\" (which is a good thing) as it features primal drumming and a memorable piano melody. All in all, a great song, And made an excellent first single.     A Message: A gentle acoustic opening helps us recover from the \\"larger than life\\" sound of the previous two tracks. The lyrics and vocals are very honest and sincere. It's a really sweet song. That's all I can say.     Low: R.E.M fans will love this won. It just doesn't sound like Coldplay....ughhh.     Hardest Part: A lot of the songs featured in \\"X and Y\\" describe the complexities that can exist in relationships between man and woman, and the emotional experience that can be associated with finding that one person of whom you want to spend the rest of you life with. This song is no exception. Musically it's quite uplifting, but sticks within the albums conceptual parameters.     Swallowed In The Sea: Nice little ballad, compliments the album for sure. But nothing, really to write home about.     Twisted Logic: This song is definitely a grower. The lyrics are really melancholy and it features a chorus that is hard not to sing along too.     Till Kingdom Come: The \\"hidden track\\" of the album. It features some really lush acoustic guitar playing, and touching vocals. It's just lovely. An excellent closer to the album.     Overall, Coldplay have done a remarkably good job here..I for one doubted whether they would be able to pull off even a decent third album considering how much presure they would of been under to replicate the success of their first and second records. Well done fellas.
B00062IVKI|1.0|New York, New York hasn't aged well at all and it shows.      Robert De Niro -who made a great career of always playing Robert De Niro- is a pathetic joke as Jimmy Doyle.  Talk about being an overrated actor...  Liza Minnelli, on the other hand overacts to the point of exhausting the viewer.  However, Liza never looked so beautiful and glamorous and one wishes she had been featured in one of those glamorous, glittering MGM musicals of the golden age of the Hollywood musical.  Kander and Ebb did an outstanding job -as usual- and we are grateful to them for the little gem titled \\"Theme from New York, New York.\\"    Did I like the DVD version?  Nope.  It ended up in the trash can, for I didn't have the heart to donate it to charity.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I read a lot of reviews for this album and all the people that didn't like it fall into 2 categories... <br /> <br />1) Hardcore/Emo/Screamo kids that are mad that their favorite band sounds too clean to stay \\"underground\\" anymore. <br /> <br />2) Pretentious musical elitists.  (One guy actually criticized Shadows basically for not being a classically trained American-Idolesque singer.  He didn't use those exact words, but it was implied.) <br /> <br />Basically Avenged is no longer the same band.  They have evolved into something better.  The clean metal vocals, unbelievable guitar work, and insane drumming reminds me of old school Guns N' Roses, only I think way better.   <br /> <br />I'm not going to do a song by song review, listen to it yourself.  But please ignore the 1 star reviews.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Well,  I first I was hesitant to hear A7X's new work. I was even thinking I would be disappointed with their new vocals on this cd. I hate to tell all of you one star reviewers, but this album may very well be the best album I have heard this millenium. Yep thats right, this millenium. Great lyrics, amazing guitarists and excellent drumming. Avenged Sevenfold has recreated the hard rock genre. I definetly recommend the following songs: Trashed and Scattered, Bat Country, Seize the Day, MIA, Strength of the World, Binded by Chains, Beast and the Harlot....yep pretty much all of them. Alright, like I said before, if you do like good freakin rock music....you will definetly enjoy this album
B000069AUI|3.0|I really hadn't heard much of 'Coldplay' and had little interest in them until I heard their song `Clocks'. I just love that song; it just stuck in my mind so I had to get the album. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed listening to the rest of this album. The music is extremely simple; very repetitive chords, little electronics, simple yet charming vocals, and resplendent lyrics. However, though the music is conservative, the album tends to grow on you the more you listen to it. It's the perfect album for my husband and I to listen to while eating dinner and winding down at the end of the day. It's just very upbeat and relaxing. Not one of the songs has an angry, political, or dance-like tone to it, which isn't a bad thing if that's what you're in the mood for. I guess that would be my only complaint about the album; that it's almost overly safe. I would like to hear a little more emotion in their songs.
B000000OTU|5.0|Aerosmith,as always,comes out with one great cd after another. <br /> They have many greatest hits cd's,but,this one,I think is the best.It has everything from Dream On to Jaded to Cryin'! <br />It has \\"Big Ones\\" from 3 decades of Aerosmith !! <br /> It is \\"Amazing\\" <br />Aerosmith,and all their CD's Rule!!!
B00097A5HW|5.0|Despus de casi 5 aos sin editar un disco (y tras el lanzamiento del super exitoso 'Laundry Service' - su primer album en ingles) la cantautora colombiana Shakira pone al mercado un nuevo material discogrfico: 'Fijacin Oral Volumen I', una pieza rara que trae una mezcla de diferentes sonidos que resulta casi - si no perfecta - a los oidos de uno que se proponga a oirla. <br /> <br />Con una base armnica sostenida por una coleccin de guitarras electricas (lo que hace del rock el rgano mas destacado del disco), y una voz fuerte y resoluta, 'Fijacin Oral I' puede convertise en el mejor disco de la carrera de la colombiana. Shakira, siempre conocida por su fuerte vibrato, ahora lo hace todava mas grave y seguro, en un album que despierta la bossa nova brasilea, en 'Obtener Un S'; la ingenuidad latina, en 'Dia de Enero'; el eurodance de los 70's, en 'Las de La Intuicin'; y un arriesgado hard rock ochentero, en 'Escondite Ingles'. <br /> <br />Sin embargo, eso no es todo. La participacin de Gustavo Cerati (cantautor argentino de rock) en las canciones 'Da Especial' y 'No' traen al disco un toque acstico que no sale desapercebido. Por fuerza del marketing, el primer single de la placa ('La Tortura') es algo totalmente distinto a las otras canciones. Una buena cancin, pero sin propsito musical (se puede describirla como: 'oveja negra del disco'). <br /> <br />'Fijacin Oral I' es un disco con la marca de Shakira, la verdadera, la original. Aquella de las letras metafricas y los sonidos etreos de siempre. Sin duda, con ese album, la cantante ha avanzado hacia el primer nivel musical dejando atrs a otras latinas como Thala o Paulina Rubio. <br /> <br />Se espera que Shakira no quiera volver a los tiempos de 'Le ro Lo re Lo re' al lanzar 'Oral Fixation Volumen II' en noviembre de este ao.
B00078XGRO|3.0|Star Trek: Fist Contact is actually Star Trek VIII, and the first feature film containing solely the Next Generation cast.  With Jonathan Frakes (Riker) at the helm as director, veteran TNG screenplay writers Braga and Moore, production designer Zimmerman, and composer Jerry Goldsmith, this film truly contains the best family of TNG artists ever assembled.  The quality of the film reflects this collaboration.  It is far and away superior to either Nemesis or Insurrection, and objectively much better than Generations (although I have a soft spot in my heart for that film). <br /> <br />The story - another Borg cube has decided to challenge the Federation, and the fleet assembles for battle.  This time, the fleet fares better than at the Battle of Wolf 359 (as shown in the TNG episodes \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" I and II).  The Cube is destroyed, but a small escape ship emerges and vanishes through a temporal (time-travel) rift.  The Enterprise is quick to pursue, knowing that the Borg must intend travelling back in time to change history and/or assimilate Earth in the past.  Our heroes arrive in the year 2063 (just after WWIII in Trek lore) to find the small Borg ship bombarding Earth.  Their target - Earth's first warp-capable ship which allows humans to make First Contact with an alien species and ultimately pave the way for the creation of the Federation and of Starfleet.  The TNG crew must fight off the Borg (who take over the Engineering decks on the Enterprise), set the timeline right (without themselves disrupting it), and save the First Contact event. <br /> <br />This must be the most action-oriented film of all the Treks.  There is a big space battle, hand-to-hand combat with the Borg, etc.  However, the soul of the film is still in the interactions between the characters: Worf and Picard disagree about how to best fight the Borg, Picard must rescue Data, Troi and Riker must work together to ensure First Contact, etc.  Even fan-favourite Reg Barkley makes an appearance!  Seamlessly inserted into the cast are Alfrie Woodard as a 21st-century engineer and James Cromwell as Zefram Cochrane, legendary pilot and inventor of Earth's first warp-capable ship.  A word about the soundtrack is appropriate here as well - veteran Jerry Goldsmith delivers a supurb score, weaving in elements of his other Trek scores.  Worf's action scenes are punctuated by the Klingon theme from ST:TMP, the space-walk music is reminiscent of the V'ger theme, etc. <br /> <br />So why only the 3-star rating?  Unfortunately, there are a lot of little issues that detract from the enjoyment of the film upon repeated viewings, which is why you buy the DVD, after all.  For example, the first 45 minutes are fantastic - action, suspense, pacing, etc. are perfect.  After that, though, the editors and/or director allow the picture to slow down and it seems to run out of steam.  More alarming are more fundamental story problems.  For example:  the away team loses contact with the Enterprise (when the Borg take over part of it) but never seems concerned.  In addition, we get an extended Moby Dick reference, which is basically a rehash of Star Trek II - there's lots of literature out there to quote, it's sheer laziness to repeat the Moby Dick theme. <br /> <br />But the most serious problem is the change wrought upon the Borg, relative to their civilisation in the TV show.  They are given a queen who, apparently, controls the collective consciousness.  Suddenly there is a leader who, when killed, fatally disrupts the collective so it can no longer function.  The original point of the Borg was that they were not hierarchical - the only way to kill the Borg was to wipe out every single one of them.  Now, suddenly, there is a simple magic bullet solution that all you have to do is find and kill the leader?  This completely negates the strength and fearsomeness of the Borg, making them another mundane enemy race. <br /> <br />Naturally, I have no complaints about this special edition.  There are lots of goodies here, including three commentaries by (in order of decreasing interest) writers Braga and Moore, Trek guru Okuda, and director Frakes.  There are lots of little featurettes to keep the techies happy, talking about effects, design, etc.  And the price is very reasonable for a DVD of this quality!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's highly anticipated new album \\"X & Y\\" delivers in spades. Though I was skeptical at first and didn't find many of the songs catchy, my opinion changed drastically after listening to the album a couple of times. These songs grow on you -- and once they get inside your head, they'll never leave it. Nothing here is specifically groundbreaking, but that's okay because it follows a formula similar to the one that produced \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". which is one of my all-time favorite albums. Given time, \\"X & Y\\" might just rise to that position. <br /> <br />Individual Track Ratings (relative for a Coldplay album): <br /> <br />1. Square One - 8/10 - great, energetic opening track. <br />2. What If - 9/10 - nice ballad, a real grower. <br />3. White Shadows - 10/10 - stunning. my favorite track on the album. <br />4. Fix You - 8/10 - simple yet catchy and powerful. <br />5. Talk - 9/10 - Soaring rock track, awesome chorus. <br />6. X & Y - 8/10 - original, interesting. <br />7. Speed of Sound - 9/10 - great choice for first single, good bridge from last album. <br />8. A Message - 8/10 - acoustic love song. <br />9. Low - 8/10 - fastest song, great guitar riffs. <br />10. The Hardest Part - 7/10 - unlike previous Coldplay songs. <br />11. Swallowed in the Sea - 8/10 - inspiring, devoted song. <br />12. Twistic Logic - 9/10 - incredible chorus, nifty lyrics. <br />13. 'Til Kingdom Come (Bonus Track) - 9/10 - originally written by Coldplay for the late Johnny Cash, unique and heart-felt closing track. <br /> <br />Buy this album! You will not regret it!
B00097A5I6|5.0|FINALLY!  An Oasis album I can listen to as much as I listened to their B-side collection, MasterPlan.  This album is the most musically listenable Oasis album ever.<br /><br />While Heathen Country was tedious to get through, this does what the Gallaghar brothers do so well-craft lush guitar-driven rock and roll songs.  They sound like a revival band?  They sound like the Beatles?  (I'm not a musician and I sound more like the Beatles).  At least they don't sound like Coldplay:<br /><br />Oh, look at the flowers<br />Bloomin' on your bum<br />As the Chocolate sky<br />Cries my love... (piano tinkle tinkle)<br /><br />No, these guys rock out, thankfully.  I suppose the refrain Let there be Love conjures up All you need is Love, perhaps, but no.  The one issue with Oasis is they refuse to put a single song on their album that lyrically isn't a clich&eacute;.  Turn me on, blow me away, hole in the sky,  song after song, you've heard it somewhere else before and this causes everyone to think they are a retro band of some sort.  Come on, it's just bad lyrics.  Enjoy the music!<br /><br />I do like when he snarls LOVE ONE ANOTHER! His tone, this group singing that? (Because I certainly won't love you!!! it sounds like... lov it)
1932100385|5.0|I have read many of the popular diet and nutrition books out there, and none of them have been able to stand up to this one. Although I knew that fruits and vegetables were very healthy, I used to vigorously defend moderation. I liked a hamburger or other beef dish two or three times a week and I tried to eat low-fat meats most other days. Chips and soda were only occasional treats, so I thought I was eating pretty good. But I was overweight, and I started doing the diet book merry go round. At the insistence of a good friend I bought this book and started reading it and had a hard time refuting any of the arguments made by the author. There is such a wide variety of evidence, from so many professional journals, regarding so many different studies, that it was difficult to come up with counter-arguments to defend my old beliefs. It's forced me to change the way I think about food and health.  <br /> <br />This is not a compilation of information from secondary sources like newspapers, magazines, and other popular books; this is a compilation of peer-reviewed research findings from the top biomedical journals, complete with hundreds of references. These are research findings not just from the author, but also from researchers at Harvard, Oxford, and dozens of other reputable institutions. This is the most credibility I've ever seen in a health book. <br /> <br />All of this information is strengthened by the last part of the book, the inside look at how food and medicine are being bungled in the US. <br /> <br />I also am impressed by the endorsements for this book. I don't know of any other diet and health book that has the credibility of having endorsements from a former Ivy League President, a Nobel Prize winning scientist, the former top food policy maker in Washington, the president of one of the premier cancer organizations, and a former senior World Bank official. Amazing! <br /> <br />Most importantly in the past 2 months since beginning to change my diet, Ihave lowered my cholesterol by 45 points, lost over 15 pounds, and can now walk up the stairs in my office building without having to pause halfway up. I get fewer headaches and my back and knee pain has gotten better(from losing weight, probably.) I feel great. I can't recommend this book enough.
B0000U5RNU|5.0|This is the funniest movie Ive seen in a looonnnnnn time and Im a difficult one to crack.  Highly recommended.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|A mix of everything in metal form. Great album. Old metalhead from the 80's- if you are as well- you'll like it also.
B0006OBPTA|4.0|So, it is a 3 disc set, not a 4 disc set.  The first disc actually contains the first movie, plus the behind the scenes stuff.  The second disc has just the second movie, and the third disc has the last two movies (I bet they couldn't sell very many of the 4th movie separately, that's why they put it on the same disc as the 3rd movie). <br /> <br />I have always loved the karate kid movies, and I was not happy that they weren't available anywhere.  So, when I found the set online for such a reasonable price, I jumped at the chance of getting them. <br /> <br />They are classic 80's movies, about a boy coming of age, and finding his own straight path in a crooked world, with the help of a wise older man.  I loved Pat Morita in these movies, he does such a good job of being a mentor, combining the fun, with the work, with the humor.  When I was younger, I had a crush on Ralph Macchio - oh, was he cute! <br /> <br />All in all, a worthy set of movies!
B0009KA7BS|5.0|This was a fantastic movie regardless of its comic book origins.  Keanu Reeves does a great job playing his role as a tormented veteran demon hunter who knows his time is running out.  He delivers a great sense of foreboding that you begin to understand as you learn about where he is headed.  Rachel Weisz's character is played with some inconsistency, first wanting the help of Constantine, then shunning it when he offers.  A minor annoyance.  The pace is good, and the plot develops very consistently, with some great lessons for all of us intertwined.  Highly recommended.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|words cannot express how much i love this album. ive had a downloaded copy for about a week and a half, and i cannot stop listening to it. this is so good, it doesnt suck that he cant scream anymore because a7x has changed for the better. the first couple of reviews express the same feeling i do: each song is a 10/10 <br /> <br />1.Beast and the harlot - 3rd best song on the album, possible 2nd single.realesed on there website early <br />2.Burn it down - i wasnt feeling this song at first but now i am. <br />3.Blinded in chains - awesome   <br />4.Bat Country - best song on the album.....so good. 1st single <br />5.Trashed and scattered - an early realesed song from there website, its good but not the best <br />6.

B0006L16N8|5.0|This is an album that isn't Perfect on its first listening-to.  The first time I listened to it I was overwhelmed by the effects tailor-made to arena shows.   I couldnt' focus in on listening to the music--it all sounded like too much.  But after a couple more times I settled in, and this CD is very good.  It is well worth it.  The track \\"X&Y\\" gives a taste of Politik, its my favorite---other good ones are \\"Fix You\\" and \\"Talk\\"....I don't get why people like \\"What If\\" and \\"White Shadows\\"--they aren't very good.  White Shadows sounds like techno to me and \\"What If\\" has cliche lyrics.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|PEOPLE!!!!! Stop rating this album so highly.  You people are crazy. <br />Ok... Last year I bought Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and Waking the Fallen at the same time.  I had heard bits of Waking the Fallen and thought that this was the best band to come out in a long time.  I was right, but only if that was their only album.  Sounding the Seventh Trumpet was about half as well written, well produced and well played as Waking the Fallen, which is easily one of my favorite albums of all time.   <br />Since StST was their first effort, I saw the huge improvement they all made as musicians and writers in Waking the Fallen, so naturally I was pumped to hear the new album thinking that it would be their best to date.... Wow was I wrong or what???? <br />This album is weak, and thats coming from a fan of A7X.  It seems like they tried to do too much with the album.  I don't even think any of it is radio-worthy.  Although the early metal influence is what makes them a great band, there is to much of it in this album.  WAAAAAYYYYYY over-produced.  They should have stuck with the formula for Waking the Fallen. Shadows' lead vocals in Waking the Fallen were outstanding.  This album sounds like he went back to the Sounding the Seventh Trumpet voice which I did not like at all.  Sounds weak and young, where as Waking the Fallen sounded powerful and mature. I'm not even excited to see them on the warped tour anymore because I know they're only gonna play this album.  Again.... WEAK. <br />I think this album is going to be the end for them.  And if they get even bigger because of it we live in a world of idiots.  Thank you.
0060090367|4.0|A very whitty, and entertaining book. I love the characters, and I only gave it 4 stars because I know Marian Keyes has done better in other books.  But if there was such a thing as 4 and a half, that's what I would have given this book.  I would read it again, it was fun, clever, and lovable... I hate to give away the book in a review, but the ending is a bit of a twist, even if it a bit stretched in the reality department.
0440180295|3.0|Billy Pilgrim is a man who witnessed the firebombing of Dresden during World War II where he was a POW. Later in life he believes he was abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore. Sometime after this he became unstuck in time, constantly shifting from one time period of his life to another. One minute he is in the POW camp, and the next he is on Tralfamadore and the next at home with his wife. Slaughterhouse Five is filled with absurd images and people and speaks to how we handle traumatizing events in our lives. It is an oddly structured book in that there is no real beginning, middle or end and constantly jumps around in time and place. It is worthwhile  to read this book for its absurd humor and deft characterization of Billy Pilgrim, but it does not strike me as the iconic classic it is made out to be.
B00082IJ08|4.0|The album was really growing on me, and then the hook line and anti-Bush rap on Dirty Harry sealed the deal for me. <br /> <br />\\"The war is over <br />So said the speaker <br />With the flight suit on <br />Maybe to him I'm just a pawn <br />So he can advance <br />Remember when I used to dance <br />All I wanna do is dance\\" <br /> <br />Obviously different from their first effort, with the lineup shuffle, but just as good.
B0007P3582|4.0|This album is a lot better than a lot of reviews would have you believe.  On the other hand it's probably not as good as sells would leave you to believe either.  The album starts with an intro produced by Eminem that's basically picking up right where ENCORE left off with now 50 shooting his fans.  \\"In My Hood\\" is the first song and it has a solid beat but at times 50's not flowing that well with the beat which is bad because his flow is his greatest strenght on the mic.  But not to worry 50 has more than enough of his laid back flows to come.  And he even gets a little more creative lyrically on \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\" where he raps the entire song from heroin's point of view.  You've got to expect the 50 diss song \\"Piggy Bank\\" where he goes after Nas, Jadakiss and Fat Joe.  Stirring up controversy is definitely another of 50's strongest points.  There are of course plenty of club tracks like \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"Disco Inferno\\" and \\"Just A Lil' Bit\\".  In the end the album could have used some editing to get it down to a solid album with all hot songs but in the end there are more than enough good tracks on this CD to make it worth the purchase for any fan of past G-Unit records.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|In my world people are not acting like this?  Or are they?  Selfish, selfish, self gratifying, live for the moment sad people portrayed in this film.  Clive Owen gives a powerful performance.  He is gorgeous but nasty.  Jude Law's character is sexy but pitiful.  Nice to see Julia Roberts in a role with some meat to it.  Beware if the use of the F word turns you off as it is tossed around here every few seconds.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Gorilaz pretty much made up their own genre of music..Its not Hip-Hop, its not Rock, Techno or anything else..It deffinetly is not for everyone, some people might say its \\"Weird\\"..I love their music, from production to lyrics its overall a great Band.. <br /> <br />Look at the reviews, %80 of ppl like it..One person wrote something about Gorillaz being garbage and all, and I looked at the review, every other word was spelled incorrectly, ROFL <br /> <br />Basically every person has own taste, hear it.., Youll like it!!!!!
068987474X|4.0|I'm not sure if this book really helped me understand guys, but it was a cute book and really funny. It was more entertaining than helpful, but I would definitely recommend to any single gal.:-)
B00097A5HW|5.0|Wow, what an amazing album. Shakira never fails to impress me. I never skiped a song. This is what I call a real artist. I love the diversity of songs on this album. I really think everyone should have this CD in their collection. Fabulous.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I don't understand what is wrong with all of the idiots giving this cd i star. This is a great follow up to Waking the Fallen. I think the lack of screaming makes the cd stand out from the rest of the metalcore garbage out their. Shadows sounds awsome especially after bursting the blood vessels in his throat and having to the get surgery. Gates and Vengeance are to of the greatest guitarist out their, and a big inspiration for myself as a guitarist. Reverand drumming sounds great. Go buy this album you will not be disapointed, and all of the people b*tching about the lack of screaming let it go and listen to this awsome album for what it is.
B000002I6T|5.0|David Crosby will always hold a unique place in music history (being a part of The Byrds and C-S-N-Y, and inducted in the Rock And Roll Hame Of Fame for both of them). He also pioneered the landmark harmonies that each group would forever be known by (and could never be surmounted by future acts to come). His first solo CD here is magical .... not because of the impressive lyrics .... but because of the tremendous state of mind it puts you in. What many might miss about Mr. Crosby is that his music has influence beyond the States (like Jazz, Blues and Rock). For example, Eastern music (particular Indian) is what influences him and, thus, what he employs alot (throughout his career). There is also a great deal of classical influences (particularly with the vocal pieces he puts together). However, the high breath and depth that was the 1960s music/art period is shining clear here; Mr. Crosby employs that mellow and spiritual feel with the guitar playing that is heard throughout. \\"What Are Their Names\\" questions the way the political system was being run and \\"I'd Swear There Was Somebody Here\\" is a deeply affecting short closer that is Mr. Crosby's way of dealing with the loss of a close loved one. He didn't once disappoint .... and therefore the record itself stands tall and impressive, even today.
B00005JNEW|3.0|It is sad that for some people forever is determined by their last years in high school.  This movie moved slow in the beginning.  Unless you're really into football you'd walk away.  Billy Bob is a chameleon.  He drastically changes in each role I see him in.  Amazing actor.  Lucas Black is phenomenal.  I hope to see more from him in the future.  At one point, I thought the move would take a terrible turn, a la Slingblade, with Billybob and Lucas killing off Tim Mcgraw's character.
B0006L16N8|5.0|If you own Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head and are satisfied with X&Y, then I'm sure there's no need for you to read this, but if you're like myself, and don't want to see a great band get bashed by others, speak up.  Coldplay is one of the best bands of the post-2000 era, and although some may call them a watered down version of Radiohead, the similarities end at the fact that both groups are British.  Thom Yorke's lyrics and the layering and sound production in Radiohead's music are much more complex (i'm a huge fan of radiohead and dont deny that they are a much better band), but coldplay's music is much more melodic and powerful.  \\"Big\\" sounds is how i'd classify X&Y (sounding almost orchestral at times).  Sure, Chris Martin may be spitting out simple and obvious lyrics (so much so that you can often predict what he will say), but that's part of the beauty of the music - simple, yet moving. Certain tracks definitely stick out on this album:  \\"Fix You\\" is amazing (and is even better live), as are the first three tracks (\\"Square One,\\" \\"What if\\" and \\"White Shadows\\").  Despite the rip off of Kraftwerk, \\"Talk\\" is also great and pretty catchy.  \\"Till Kingdom Come\\" - Chris Martin's dedication to Johnny Cash - is also a great bonus track.  If you see them in concert on this tour, you'll see the drummer play the piano and the bassist play the guitar on this track. \\"X&Y\\" is probably the low point on the cd, but otherwise, it's phenomenal.  I'd rank it at par with \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\"  Seriously check them out in concert if you get a chance.  I saw them at the Coachella Festival and the HFS Festival and they put on a great show.
0790729407|5.0|Recently I have read reviews on this film on amazon which made me laugh out loud. this film has no similarities to 9/11 whatsoever. Michael Collins was in no way a terrorist as all his actions were aimed at the British occupational troops and not the Irish people. In fact if certain people had consulted their history books before writing, they would see that it was in fact the British(the supposed bastion of democracy of the time) who comitted the various attrocities such as the cold blooded murder of 12 innocent people on November 21, 1920 who had no connection to the \\"war of independence \\". It was only later that the IRA moved into terriorism. The sub-sequent attrocities carried out on innocent people in the UK and the North would never have been advocated or supported by the original founders of the organisation. So folks please stop with these ignorant and laughable reviews. Oh and by the way, I really enjoyed the movie and thourhaghlly recommend it.
B00000F14B|4.0|The film version of Meridith Wilson's smash Broadway hit musical \\"The Music Man\\" stars Robert Preston, reprising his role from the show, as Professor Harold Hill, Academy Award winner Shirley Jones (\\"Elmer Gantry\\", Academy Award; \\"Oklahoma!!\\") as Marian Paroo and seven-year old Ron Howard as Winthrop Paroo, Marian's adorable little brother. The movie features classic tunes as \\"Good Night, My Someone\\" (which I fell in love with the moment I heard Shirley Jones singing it-and nearly cried as well), the tender love song \\"Till There Was You,\\" \\"Trouble\\" and, of course, the show-stopping \\"76 Trombones.\\" These songs (and others in the film, like \\"Shipoopi\\") have become part of American culture and ingrained in our brains. The movie is filled with non-stop humor, warmth and innocent romance-ahhh, what else could you wish for? My favorite songs are \\"Good Night, My Someone,\\" \\"Till There Was You\\", \\"Madam Libraian\\" and \\"76 Trombones,\\" though all the songs in this classic and timeless musical favorite are excellent, from start to show-stopping finale. The mayor and his wife provide most of the film's humor. The late/legendary comedian Buddy Hackett also appears in a small role for more comic relief.<br /><br />The Special Edition DVD features an introduction to the film by Shirley Jones, 2 theatrical trailers, film recommendations and a 30-minute \\"Making-of\\" documentary that details how the movie was conceived, hosted by-who else?-Shirley Jones. Rated G.
B000002I6V|5.0|Graham Nash made a big splash of an impact with this 1971 solo debut album. All of the tracks are equally impressive, that after a while it becomes mighty difficult to call out your favorites. Suffice it to say, I enjoy the entire album .... not a track is wasted, and the order in which they are put is just right. His sheer talent for pop craftsmanship (courtesy of Beatles influences) never disappoints (especially during C-S-N-Y days), but Graham Nash as a songwriting leader takes shape very succinctly here. He is politically conscious with \\"Military Madness\\" (which is actually about the past in England, not Vietnam as some might intitially suspect) and \\"Chicago\\" (which calls out for aid during the troubled times of 1968, which found their way onto the Democratic Convention in that city that very same year). \\"Wounded Bird\\" is cleverly crafted in a Bob Dylan-like way .... \\"Be Yourself\\" is relatable to anyone, any age, during any time (when answers are scarce and questions about life's difficulties remain) .... \\"Simple Man\\" is a beautiful, short piece of pop that is highlighted by the gorgeous harmonies (thanks to Rita Coolidge) and piano playing (another facet of Mr. Nash). Once the record draws to a close, you realize there is some hope in the air (despite the turbulent times of atmosphere in which this album was released) as \\"Military Madness\\" (1st track) is answered quite nicely with \\"We Can Change The World\\" (last track).
0060977493|5.0|This is the most beautifully written book ever. It is written with the senses. Buy a copy, read it and keep it. It's part of me now.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Don't get distracted by the hoopla, just let the music ripple over you. I consider the first tracks the Four Horsemen of the album: \\"Square One\\", \\"What If\\", \\"White Shadows\\", and \\"Fix You\\". I predict that Fix You will become the most popular track of all. The front mix is perfect, and each song seamlessly transitions from one to the other with endings that will remind you of The Beatles, U2, Radiohead, and even Pink Floyd. Listen to the album without distraction, and you will be blown away. The playlist is weakest in the middle: \\"A Message\\", \\"Low\\", and \\"The Hardest Part\\". \\"Low\\" is an irritating U2 weak-sister song with an unbearable vocal, unbearable enough for the hidden track designation. With \\"Swallowed In The Sea\\", X&Y gets back on track with solid vocals.
B0007XT87G|4.0|Deadwing, the latest effort by London based prog rockers Porcupine Tree, is the logical sequel to the ground breaking \\"In absentia\\", my choice for record of the year for 2002.  Prog metal fans with a penchant for other types of music such as classic rock, classic metal and even the more mainstream Nu rock will find this record very appealing. Musically the band sound as tight and heavy as on their previous effort, a good change from the more mellow, soft and atmospheric songs the band developed in earlier productions. I praise Steven Wilson's newfound love for heavy riffs, more complex arrangements, with the guitars, bass and drums dominating the scene while the keyboard offers textures and atmospheric soundscapes ideal to complete the song's moods and feels, this is the Porcupine Tree many wanted to hear for a long time...Hard to admit is, however, that Wilson's voice lacks the pitch to stand up against the powerful riffery some songs offer ( just listen to  \\"Shallow\\", \\"Halo\\" and \\"Open car\\", the record's heaviest songs...) and serves more its purpose on more mellow or clean guitar based songs like \\"Lazarus\\" \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" and even the great \\"Arriving somewhere but not here\\"...where Steven's voice is not drowned behind the huge wall of sound, but I think this a forgivable shortcoming.   Lyrically, the record is very challenging (being a supposed soundtrack for a non existent film) with many passages worth digging into.  Finally I think at this point in time any comparison to other bands is practically inevitable but I think PT has managed to arrange their influences (ranging from Tool to Yes and from Dream Theater to Kansas and Rush)very well to produce something they can really call their own...Great Record!!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Need I say more?. I don't think so. Just listen to it!!!!!.
B00000C3G6|5.0|After hearing the excellent C&N singing brilliantly as 'back-up' with Carole King live on \\"You've Got A Friend,\\" I knew these two sounded perfect on their own (without being caught up in C-S-N-Y fanfare, though the group was certainly special in its own right) and wanted to discover more. I did some searching online and was fortunate enough to find this album one day (used but still in PERFECT condition). Needless to say, I was transfixed from beginning to end and played the whole thing over again .... that doesn't always happen, especially these days with the current music spectrum. There are so many great things to say about this album that I honestly don't know where to begin. Suffice it to say, it heals me .... puts me at ease inside with strong comfort .... you can tell how well these two blend together, and their diverse styles/influence match in just the right frame .... \\"Where Will I Be?\\" is nothing short of genius; the brief but important lyrics and captivating choir-like wails from C&N allow the song to transcend typical 'pop' boundaries .... \\"Stranger's Room\\" has an impassioned desperation to it that cries out for more listening .... I like how whenever Crosby or Nash takes lead vocals, the other one follows behind with higher harmonies; after a while, it makes you wonder who is actually singing .... I'll close with this quote my dad said after listening to this album: \\"They mastered the art of minimalism with the guitar playing, less is more when it comes down to the instrumental aspect, it doesn't all have to be about heavy solos.\\"
B0002KVUKM|3.0|THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!! BUT THE SPECIAL EFFECTS IS REALLY GREAT!!! ALL IN ALL I GUESS THAT IS WHAT SAVED THIS MOVIE Van Helsing was suppose to be a great action adventure and most fans thought that this was a prequel to Bram Strokers Dracula, i was so wrong and mistaken, what a misconception i had....... this really fool me into going and see this movie, I still like Hugh Jackman, i think most people went to see him apart form great acting talent ,his carisma also saved this mockery of Van Helsing this is not the story i wanted to see and DRACULA in this movie is pathetic!!!! who the hell wanted to see a \\"mad psycho-sexual silivating moronic whining bitch\\" as THE ORIGINAL DRACULA sad!!!!!!!!!! i hate this movie i wouldn't give it a star but Hugh Jackman and the special effect must worth something, maybe a kid would like this but not me laterzzzz folks............
B0006L16N8|5.0|Ok, at first the songs seemed a bit out of place--like they should be on the Killers next album, but after a couple more listens, I realized that this is Coldplay 2.0--it's the exact place they needed to go next.    From \\"Square One\\" to \\"Twisted Logic,\\" this album's a trip that you won't soon forget. And though \\"Low\\" is indeed the low part of the album--even it's twanging bridge is amazing, and the only thing weighing it down is a bit of repetition--and that's the only song with a flaw.    For the fair weather fans who only appreciate Coldplay's former, more simple albums, the latter songs on the album, such as \\"Hardest Part\\" and \\"Swallowed by the Sea\\" are perfect for you. And it's not hard to imagine buying this album for any one song on it, either--they're all just that good.    Don't listen to it expecting anything, because chances are you'll be listening for Parachutes or AROBTH--but what you'll get is something very different--no, pretend like you just heard Coldplay and this is their debut album--then you'll realize that there's much much more to simplicity than you originally thought.    Close your eyes and pick out one of the layers within the song, while letting everything else just compliment it--it'll take you up into the clouds and toss you around--you'll be bombarded with symphonic harmonies and surreal choruses that'll have you wondering if you're still awake or just dreaming...    Get this album and make Coldplay your best band ever, too.
0156027321|3.0|Martel's novel raises some interesting philosophical and religious questions, but they're more likely to get the gray matter working a little than to get you reflecting on the deepest mysteries of the universe.  The style is serviceable but shines in a couple places, the story is top-notch, and it will get you thinking.  This is the kind of novel I'd suggest for summer reading.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|While still a solid album, it is lacking what the other two had. Raw energy, emotion and intensity. The other albums were so intense I got goosebumps! Where is the screaming and emotion? The lyrics are just not the same either. Just doesn't seem like they put all they had into this. I am still a huge fan, but would like to see them get back to the original stuff! Still worth the money though.
B00004TFOB|5.0|While the C&N self-titled debut (could otherwise be known as 'The Black Album') was special for its mellow simplicity, this sequel can be highly appreciated as a darker and more rockin' turn. Graham Nash never sounded more angry in a song than he did on \\"Take The Money And Run\\" .... David Crosby devled deep into his own inner demons with \\"Carry Me\\" that brings tears to this listener every time he hears it, because you can tell just how perfect these two sound singing together, and much of a gift to the rest of us out there that it was made possible in this life .... One gets the feeling that what is being done here is nothing short of powerful .... the aggressive lyrics are teetering on the edge of Bob Dylan 1960s 'finger-pointing' tunes (such as \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\"). Besides the harmonies (more often displayed this time around, as opposed to the previous album), the guitar playing is amazing. The 1960s may have been over at the point of the \\"Wind On The Water\\" release, but C&N make sure that the genuine grievances against Man's social and moral choices would not be forgotten. Plus, the hardships in life that we all go through are reflected here and serve as a reminder that in our struggles, we are not completely alone.
B00000JG41|5.0|This was the first Bungle album I ever baught.  I was rocking out to Carry Stress in the Jaw one day on many drugs.  I emediately went out to buy a Bungle album.  I'm a musician and this album made no sence to me at first. It was very thematic, but the ideas were too different to me.  I chucked the cd in a pile of crap in my basement, and like a year later I slowly started forcing myself to listen to it.  After once or twice through I fell in love.  How could such different syles of music fit together so seemlesly.  Yea this is the most \\"normal\\" Bungle album, but thats because thier ideas \\"fit\\" together on this effort.  Utterly origiinal and amazing!
B00097DX3U|4.0|Audioslave has succeeded in creating a great album with more of a fusion of their styles than just an addition. <br /> <br />In their self-titled album, Audioslave seemed to add their sounds together from both Chris's singing and RATM's playing, but now the least of those sounds have been abolished--on their second album, Audioslave's managed to create a complete fusion of their sounds. Chris's singing has gotten softer and more melodic, and the band's style has conformed more to his singing as well. <br /> <br />For me, this works fabulously--I love their new songs, and if it weren't for a couple of non-stand-out songs on this album, it'd get a 5. <br /> <br />Definitely worth buying.
0792844793|2.0|1986 R-rated movie (nudity, violence & profanity). Murder-mystery. <br /> <br />DVD Features: The DVD contains the movie (in English or French with French, Spanish or no subtitles), and the trailer {Note: I'm reviewing the \\"basic\\" DVD, not the \\"Special Edition\\"} .   <br /> <br />Credits: A film written & directed by David Lynch (\\"Mulholland Drive\\"; \\"Twin Peaks\\") starring Kyle MacLachlan (Jeffrey Beaumont; \\"Twin Peaks\\"), Isabella Rosellini (Dorothy Valens; \\"Wyatt Earp\\"), Dennis Hopper (Frank Booth; \\"Hoosiers\\"), Laura Dern (Sandy Williams; \\"Jurassic Park\\"), and Dean Stockwell (Ben; \\"Quantum Leap\\"). <br /> <br />Plot: A \\"murder mystery\\" that includes nightclub singers, kidnappers and a small town, Lumberton.  A man returns to his small town from college because his old man is in the hospital.  Once he arrives back home he finds a severed ear.  This discovery leads him and police detective's high school daughter to investigate the matter.   <br /> <br />Review: I was reluctant to watch this movie because I rather dislike one and maybe two of the main actors, but as the film seems to be critically acclaimed, and as it is a murder mystery, I decided to watch it. <br /> <br />The movie starts off with an oldish man collapsing while watering his lawn and who ends up in the hospital.  This causes the main character, Jeffrey (Kyle), to come home from school.  While wandering around the town, he finds a human ear in some grass, and the murder mystery begins (he brings the human ear to a detective, the father of another main character, Sandy (Laura Dern)).  Despite being told by the detective that the police will handle the case, and sorry, can't tell him anything, Jeff and Sandy are too intrigued by the issue to just leave it to the police, and so they investigate the issue themselves (which includes investigating a nightclub singer). <br /> <br />I'm not sure what the age Sandy and Jeff are supposed to be (Jeff's a college student, and Sandy is a high school senior), but bothactors seem to be older than the characters they are pretending in the movie (I guess Dern just looked older than her age, as she was 19 when the movie was released; MacLachlan, on the other hand, was a 27 year old college student (which is actually conceivable, but much closer in age to Rossellini than might be perceived by the audience).   <br /> <br />The time period of the movie is quite hard to determine.  The clothing, hair styles, music and car models appear from many periods (roughly 1950s-1980s).  The acting is spotty, with at least one main actor not particularly good.  The plot is strange and somewhat illogical.  The music is good, but dated (and one of the reasons it is difficult to determine the time period). A long boring, somewhat tedious movie with bad dialogue.  Might be one of those movies you either like or hate.  Overall, I would give the movie 1 and 1/2 stars.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This film is at turns hilarious, sad, and frightening.  Donnie is a confused adolescent, perhaps mentally ill, who is either communing with a vision, freaking out, dreaming, or being manipulated.  The best thing is that all the connections are never really explained, so it is left to the viewer to interpret it.  That means it can be viewed over and over, which it will in our house because the acting is excellent and the cinematography is beautiful.  And it does not conform to the usual feel-good junk that comes out of hollywood.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
B000002H97|4.0|All I'll say is that this album is not like the previous Metallica albums. It turns in a direction of more pop metal and away from the longer songs. There doesn't seem to be a theme as in previous albums. Also the quality of the tracks are not kept up. Despite this it is still a good album so it deserves 4 stars.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|After one spin through the CD I didn't quite know what to make of it.  I knew I had just heard the most diverse DT offering yet (ballads, rock, flute, metal, prog jams, pop, you name it) but neither loved it nor hated it.  Rather, I couldn't wait to hear it again.   <br /> <br />I remembered that I didn't fall in love with Scenes From A Memory right off the bat, but now I consider it one of my absolute favorite CD's of all-time, if not my favorite.  Both Six Degrees and Train of Thought I enjoyed immediately and listened to incessantly, but I don't rank either as \\"classics.\\"  So does this mean that Octavarium will become a classic for me?   <br /> <br />It's too early to tell.  What I do know, however, is that after a couple more listens I know I've heard a great CD full of focused songwriting, diverse sounds, some signature DT, and (dare I say) some down-right catchy songs. <br /> <br />1) The Root of All Evil (8:03) - Part III of Mike Portnoy's AA saga; references lyrics and musical passages from both Part I (The Glass Prison) and particularly Part II (This Dying Soul).A solid rock song; no major frills, a short \\"DT-style\\" jam section.  Not a DT classic, but a very cool song nonetheless, and a great opener.   <br /> <br />2) The Answer Lies Within (5:26) - Track 1 segues into this beautiful, simple Elton John-like ballad.  The lyrics struck me as a little unoriginal and too simple at first, but after realizing that John Petrucci is singing it to one of his children, I can accept it much more easily.  While his lyrics may not be as deep or complicated as they were on DT's first 4 albums, I have to respect that he's in a different place in his life as a family man and has new things on his mind.   <br /> <br />3) These Walls (6:59) - Love this song.  Dare I say it sounds like Korn meets Journey.  What sounds like a tuned-down 7-string guitar opens a song with beautiful swaying melodies and a simple but powerful solo that reminds me a lot of Neil Schon from Journey.All in all a simple song with very powerful, beautiful and heavy melodies.  This is what I love about Dream Theater - their ability to capture all these elements in one song.   <br /> <br />4) I Walk Beside You (4:29) - By far the most straight-forward pop song DT has ever written.  Seems like blasphemy for a prog-rock band, but I've gotta hand it to them - they write one hell of a beautiful, catchy pop/rock song.  Comparisons to U2, Coldplay and Journey will be made, and if this song came from a more mainstream band, I guarantee it would hit huge on the radio.  Proof that DT has the ability to write anything. <br /> <br />5) Panic Attack (7:16) - Ah, the metal song.  After three slower, more melodic songs, this song comes at the perfect time.  It sounds a lot like the C-tuned songs on Train of Thought with some obvious influence from the band Muse in the middle and end vocal lines.  Overall a great heavy DT track. <br /> <br />6) Never Enough (6:33) - My least favorite song on the album.  While DT has always borrowed liberally from their influences, this song just sounds waaaay too much like Muse, particularly the current single \\"Stockholm Syndrome.\\"  It's a pretty cool song with some awesome keyboard work, a nice opening riff and a cool middle section, but particularly in the verses and somewhat in the chorus I don't even feel like I'm listening to Dream Theater.   <br /> <br />7) Sacrificed Sons (10:42) - Awesome.  The 9/11-inspired lyrics from James seem a little too late and feel like they were already done in their song \\"In the Name of God,\\" but all the music from start to finish is quintessential DT.  Nice touch with the orchestra as well.   <br /> <br />8) Octavarium (24:00) - I need to give this one a few more listens.  I feel like some people instantly love it just because it's an epic, and there are many parts of the songs that instantly grabbed me (the eerie Pink Floyd-like intro, the opening melodies right before the lyrics), but it's not hitting me asa \\"DT classic\\" yet.   <br /> <br />That being said, this is a 75-minute album that I've owned for less than a day, so I don't expect everything to hit me all at once, but I'm already hearing an excellent, well-thought-out work from one of the best bands around.  I definitely recommend this album for anyone, and especially for a novice DT listener as it seems to have something for everyone.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album deserves more than five stars...but since five stars is the maximum rating...Fine. I'll deal with it. But seriously, lets give it what it deserves. <br /> <br />This is a fantastic album...Yorke's Crooning, Radiohead's completely un-simplistic sound. It's a brilliant album. <br /> <br />You cant lose with this cd.  It might scratch a sore that hadn't healed. It might make you feel lonely or depressed. It could encapture every negative feeling you've ever experienced...But hey, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  <br /> <br />Let OK Computer take you inside a world of pale blue, confused love, and into a sorrowful, but beautiful place. If I believed in God, I'd thank him for creating such a genius as Thom Yorke...Guess I'll just give my thanks to him and his talented band. Thanks Radiohead.
B0006L16N8|4.0|The above quote taken from a Pitchfork review, which for the first time in a long long time hit the nail right on the head for me.<br /><br />I have to say that compared to A Rush Of Blood To The Head, this is a huge step forward in their sound as a band (although Chris is very often drowned out by everyone else). They definitely sound more interested in the music at the very least. That's all that keeps me from giving this album 3 stars.<br /><br />The complaints I have about this album are that the songs too often come off as uninspired. The biggest \\"WTF??\\" that was drawn from me came from the first single, 'Speed of Sound'. In a way it's what 'Clocks' should have been, but since it wasn't, there really is no reason for such a blatant recycling of music. Not a bad song, but the simple fact that 'Clocks' came first really takes all the credibility away for me.<br /><br />Coldplay are showing off their influences more than ever on this album. 'Talk', which samples Kraftwerk's 'Computer Love', came off to me as annoying on first listen, just because I was all \\"Hey, it's Kraftwerk.\\" 'Fix You' is not sampling anything, though I found it is very heavy on the Sigur Ros-itude. Comparing it to Sigur Ros leaves a lot to be desired; on its own, 'Fix You' is a good song.<br /><br />The good points of this album seem to reside heavily on the \\"X\\" side of the album, while \\"Y\\" is very stagnant sounding. The other upside to this album is how Coldplay has captured a little more of that live sound that makes them good. In the end, X&Y just reminded me of what has bugged me about Coldplay for so long, which is how they've released like 3 albums of teasers for what might maybe possibly be ahead in the future.<br /><br />X&Y also gets props for the most niftiest of trendy silicone wristbands it came with.
0345446798|5.0|This is a really good book in my opinion. I have three dogs and train them in Agility and Obedience and still got a lot from the book. There are a lot of things I never realized about what our body positions mean to the animals we love. This book is a lot about the people. It has information about the dogs, but mostly just to show you \\"why your dog doesn't come to you when you bend over and call them while having your arms wide open\\" or \\"why your dog may snap at you when you smile at her\\". A warning to people who don't believe in evolution: this book has quite a bit of evolution in it. It's really good though.
B00004T8RK|4.0|After having joined the band to replace fired Dave Abbruzzese, drummer Jack Irons exited from Pearl Jam (citing health reasons).  His presence seemed to give the band confidence to expand their horizons, and after the extreme experimentation of \\"No Code\\" and the settled confidence of \\"Yield\\", a replacement would be hard to find.  It was fortunate for Pearl Jam that Soundgarden split up, leaving superb drummer Matt Cameron available.  Cameron joined up during the \\"Yield\\" tour and on this record, made his presence known. <br /> <br />The opening salvo-- three powerful, punkish songs (reminiscent of the opening on \\"Vitalogy\\") announce the new drummer nicely-- his playing is superb on the near-rabid \\"Breakerfall\\" and the explosive \\"Gods' Dice\\".  The third in this triad was written by him, a near straight punk song titled \\"Evacuation\\" that yields not a bit of the power of the two openers. <br /> <br />The album does settle down after that, \\"Light Years\\" feels like an exhale.  A great song sung in Vedder's upper register, it maintains a churning mid-tempo pace.  Of particular note on the record are two superb ballads by guitarist Stone Gossard-- the delicate \\"Thin Air\\" and the brilliant \\"Of the Girl\\".  Featuring a complex arrangement full of jangling guitars, subtle electric leads, superb percussion, and a great understated vocal, \\"Of the Girl\\" is one of the real highlights of the record.  Likewise, bassist Jeff Ament contributes the fantastic \\"Nothing As It Seems\\", again with a superb arrangement and a fantastic bluesy vocal from Vedder. <br /> <br />Admittedly, some of the material falls short-- \\"Grievance\\" and \\"Rival\\" I never really could get into, the former relies on a somewhat tacky wordplay (\\"I pledge my grievance to the flag\\"), the latter worked better live, but just isn't my kind of song, sort of a spacey mid-tempo piece with lifeless vocal harmonies, although admittedly stellar lyrics.   <br /> <br />The close of the album is three more unique pieces in the Pearl Jam catalog-- \\"Sleight of Hand\\" starts off simply enoguh, but is overwhelming with its bizarre choruses that really make the song.  This is followed up by a ukelele and vocal piece, \\"Soon Forget\\", singer Ed Vedder's story about Bill Gates, brilliantly performed, and the delicate and lovely \\"Parting Ways\\".  The latter is rather confessional and brutally honest, and I think has a universality to it like \\"Black\\" did a decade before--everyone who has fallen out of love feels what Vedder feels when he sings, full of passion and power of his words, \\"drifting away\\" at the coda of the piece. <br /> <br />Its a good record, it has a couple too many weak songs for me to speak as highly of it as I do \\"Yield\\" or \\"Riot Act\\".
0553573403|5.0|Honestly, I didn't want to read these books. But, when it comes down to it, I'm a fast reader and thinner books are pretty much a waste of money. So, when I happened upon these in a bookstore I thought, \\"Wow, those are big, and I remember being told that Martin is a good author...\\".<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />There are some things which some people may dislike about them, such as:<br /><br />***Incest - including some fairly non-descript scenes of siblings \\"in the act\\"<br /><br />***Character deaths - several, no, -many- characters die<br /><br />***Many characters - lots of people to remember<br /><br />***A very, very long plot<br /><br />On the other hand, I had little problem with any of these. The plot is amazingly compelling and the writing impecable, so the length and number of characters wasn't so much a problem - especially with the appendix in the back. The incest was not distressing for me - it wasn't glorified and was handled maturely. And I was actually glad that an author, for once, did not flinch away from killing off main characters - especially when their actions leave no other alternative.<br /><br />I am absolutely in love with these books, but I would not recommend them to everyone. If you do not enjoy politics, especially, do not read this book. If you are still interested, however, get the first one and see what you think.
B000051VQR|4.0|I happened to really like this album. I have been a fan of Green Day for years and though everyone still goes to Dookie for the poster child of good Green Day music, I see a lot of good in their other works. Warning has great songs with styles that do branch out from the ordinary. Everyone is so quick to talk about American Idiot and how it's so different but really you could see the tides beginning to change with this album. They were already becoming more mature at this point. If you don't believe me, take a good listen to the song \\"Misery\\". Its rather spooky. It doesn't use the traditional guitar, bass, and drums, it introduces a sound that we usually don't hear from them, though it vaguely reminds me of \\"Hitchin A Ride\\". Misery has a rather creepy vibe. Mix in the creepy with the slightly political and the classic pop-punk sound and you have the album. To me its not their best work but its still up there with the great Green Day albums.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Who says that you have to take serious issues seriously to get your point across, not SOAD thats for sure here's the distorted track listing song by song. <br /> <br />1.B.Y.O.D-Or Bring Your Own Beer as we say. This song touched base on (i would say) the senseless death in the Iraq war, of young americans. And how they themselves slaughter innocent people, but yet party in the desert in a celebration of deadly carnage. With a super catchy chorus that would have Britney, or Christina going wow, why did'nt i write that. <br /> <br />2.Revenga-Great song about the angst inside after a fallin apart relastionship with a control freak, she's obviously a female, hense the name REVENGA.:)With some beautiful vocal harmonies. <br /> <br />3.Cigaro-My C#ck is much bigger than yours, my C@ck can walk right through that door. Enough said <br /> <br />4.Radio/Video-HEY MAN LOOK AT ME ROCKIN NOW....i'm on the RADIO!!!...With a great polka typer break in the middle in which they sing about someone named Johnny Leison?? Dunno But Great song. <br /> <br />5.T.C.M.M.F.L.I.O.T.S-You don't have to be on coke to figure out that your on the song, i felt like i was on it the minute it started.Fast, querky, and intense. <br /> <br />6.Question!-Definately a more Aerials typer serious song about the Question! of where we go when we die, they don't say but the song is heartfelt no matter what you believe in. Again great harmonies and good back up vocals from the guitarist. <br /> <br />7.Violent Pornography-Speedy vocals, good message for distorted individuals who are into S&M and bondage.HA. Yet True. <br /> <br />8.Sad Statue-Definate overtones of 9/11 here, or just about what a sad state America is in today. Feeling Patriotic, pass on this one if so. But i Heartlely agree. <br /> <br />9.Old School Hollywood-A.K.A (tony danza cuts in line)-Definately takes me back to the old days, with a break dance rock feel with an electric boogalo robot voice at the beginning, then breaking into the crazy SOAD kiss A%# tradition.Only this time with the guitarist at the vocal helm. GREAT GREAT song. <br /> <br />10.The slowest more serious finale' tune. This song has a very Beatlistic quality in the both vocalist and Gtarist sing together. \\"You should have never came to hollywood\\". This is true.They should know:) Its actually sad.But a goodie none the less:). <br /> <br />May take u a few days, or just a few minutes as in my case to love this album. Personaly i think the overall dynamics, song structure, melodies, harmonies, chorus's and just plain INSANITY of this album far surpass anything they've done yet, even Toxicity. Its Fast Its in your face its the demented freight train known as SYSTEM OF A DOWN!!!
B0000027RL|4.0|The result of an unlikely collaboration-- 2/3 of the principle songwriters of Mother Love Bone together with a gas station attendent, Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" is not quite the masterpiece I viewed it as in high school.  What it is, however, is a powerful debut and reasonably unique in Pearl Jam's catalog. <br /> <br />Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament (guitarist and bassist for Mother Love Bone respectively) had been working up demoes with guitarist Mike McCready (and curiously enough with future Pearl Jam drummer Matt Cameron helping out) that somehow ended up in the hands of San Diego resident Eddie Vedder, who overdubbed his surrealist, dark lyric and vocal to the recordings (\\"Alive\\", \\"Once\\", and b-side \\"Footsteps\\", for those interested) and sent it back.  Gossard called him and asked him to come up to Seattle, the rest as they say.... <br /> <br />One of the reasons \\"Ten\\" generates a lot of controversy is its sound-- its amazing how the same folks who would swear Mother Love Bone was the greatest thing on the grunge scene criticize Pearl Jam for being too indebted to the \\"classic rock\\" sound (Mother Love Bone took this sound over the top with Andy Wood's near-glam vocals).  In truth this record is definitely indebted to arena rock, but its also got one foot in grunge, and the result is somtehing both original, exciting and accessible.  Like I said, its not quite the masterpiece I viewed it as in high school (but what is?), and it suffers from unnaturally bright production, accentuating the arena rock sensibilities (the band would begin a partnership with producer Brendan O'Brien on their next album that lasts until this day). <br /> <br />But still, there's a lot of standout material, certainly \\"Black\\", the song Eddie Vedder fought the release of, is the most powerful and enduring piece on the album.  Largely what hooked me (and many others of my generation) into the band, Vedder captures lyrically the sort of emotion and anguish in a universal fashion with a resonance that israrely captured: \\"I know someday you'll have a beautiful life / I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky / why, why can't it be mine?\\").  Musically, its largely standard fare, but Vedder injects so much passion and power into his vocal that it grabs you. <br /> <br />The album yielded four singles-- alternative anthem \\"Alive\\" (one of the most misunderstood songs in history-- Vedder has stated its about incest), MTV hit \\"Jeremy\\", grunge workout \\"Even Flow\\" and the somewhat lifeless \\"Oceans\\" (no doubt selected after Vedder blocked \\"Black\\" from being a single).  Each of these has their own strength, certainly the first three received so much airplay there's not much to say about them-- they cemented the band's reputation and set the stage for dozens of imitators.  While I'm quick to dismiss \\"Oceans\\", it does feature some superb fretless basswork from Ament, its just a bit weak as a song.  But better than any of these are the album's opener and closer-- the powerful, thrashy \\"Once\\" (about the survivor of the incest of \\"Alive\\" becoming a serial killer) and the emotionally overwhelming and unescapably brilliant \\"Release\\", the song that fourteen years later I find myself most identifying with-- there's a certain universality to its acceptance message (\\"oh dear dad, can you see me now / I am myself, like you somehow / I'll ride the wave where it takes me / I'll open up, release me\\").  And certainly Vedder's punky and explosive \\"Porch\\" is just a lot of fun and while it lacks the lyrical weight of \\"Even Flow\\", it is a more powerful song. <br /> <br />Whats interesting is that the album could have been improved by substituting some of its b-sides-- \\"Wash\\" (b-side to \\"Alive\\"), \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" and \\"Footsteps\\" (b-sides to \\"Jeremy\\") for \\"Oceans\\", \\"Garden\\" and \\"Deep\\".  All of these are now available on the \\"Lost Dogs\\" compilation and are worth seeking out (\\"Footsteps\\" in particular as part three of the trilogy of \\"Alive\\" and \\"Once\\"-- the boy who became a serial killer isnow on death row awaiting his execution), but nonetheless as it is, it is a powerful and stunning debut album, far from the best Pearl Jam would ever do, but probably their most accessible.  I give it four stars because it has its flaws, between its production and a few weak songs, but its essential listening.  Recommended.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I just picked up Octavarium this morning and I have listened to it twice. It was much better the second time around and I have a feeling it will get better each time I hear it. This is the first time in a long time that I have bought a CD where there isn't one song that is below average. The second song is a ballad and is probably the weakest on the album, but it is still a good tune and worth many listens. My favorite songs are Panic Attack, These Walls, The Root of All Evil, and Octavarium. The only complaint I have is that John Petrucci, the guitar god, doesn't quite get enough play here (Rudess owns this album). One of the main reasons I love Dream Theater is because I can't wait to hear what JP will come up with next, but sadly there isn't one stand out solo. Oh well, you can't have everything. This album is better than Infinity, Six Degrees, & Train of Thought (which I also liked) and it fits just below Images, Awake, and Scenes. Dream Theater is back at what they do best and I can't wait to see them on tour.
B00008EY65|4.0|Hellboy--a 6'5\\" bright red demon with a giant stone hand and a tail. After a hard days work fighting monsters and Nazis he likes to lounge around with kitties.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro was right to cast Ron Perlman in the title role. He is absolutely perfect! Depsite being covered head-to-toe with red latex, Perlman projects Hellboy's heart and soul. And it looks like he had a blast.<br /><br />Hellboy is a fun comic book movie. Not perfect, but very entertaining. I can't wait for Hellboy 2!
B0006L16N8|5.0|With the previous Coldplay efforts so anthemic and vulnerable at the same time, one would worry with the birth of a child, singer Chris Martin would turn the band in a softer direction.  What amazes me is that the band somehow balances the perfect amount of sensitivity from the previous two albums with a new found strength that truly lives up to \\"the next U2\\" comparisons.  Martin always seems to take the attention with his spiraling vocals and touching lyrics, but new to X & Y is the coming out party of guitarist Johnny Buckland, drummer Will Champion and bassist Guy Berryman.  Buckland easily calls on the spirit of The Edge as the relationship between guitar and vocals sound more harmonious than ever.  Berryman has some astounding lines, though never the center of a song as Martin and Buckland are.  Champion's drum lines carry many of the songs, as tracks Square One and Talk help build the momentum that make  Coldplay's creshendos so strong.  Overall, I am amazed that Coldplay has made an album that so fluidly combines elements from previous efforts and new ideas/sounds.  As they become more and more one of the most recognizable bands in the world, Coldplay's natural musicianship will keep them at the top because of their ability to create a sound that is so different yet the same.
B0000028UK|3.0|After an album of anthemic rock songs, a genuine MTV hit in \\"Jeremy\\", and a constant anti-commercialism stance that belied their success, Pearl Jam went into the studio to record this, their first album with producer Brendan O'Brien.  After the recording, the band discussed the recording sessions as difficult-- evidenced further by the relative lack of material (the album is only 45 minutes long and only one b-side-- \\"Alone\\", on the \\"Go\\" single-- surfaced). <br /> <br />You get the impression Pearl Jam was trying not to repeat the success of \\"Ten\\"-- the arena rock sensibilities are largely replaced with a noisy, grunge sound-- openers \\"Go\\" and \\"Animal\\" (also the two first singles on the album) are slabs of noisy rock, without much of the hooks that made \\"Ten\\" so successful.  The same feel is found throughout the record-- \\"Blood\\" (perhaps the most telling lyric on the album concering the sound they've chosen-- \\"paint Ed big / turn Ed into one of his enemies / its my blood\\"-- and certainly one of the album's standouts) and youth grunge anthem \\"Leash\\" follow this motif. <br /> <br />Mind you, the \\"Ten\\" sound is still evident in some regards-- \\"Glorified G\\" (an anti-gun song that had its origins in a conversation between then-drummer and gun owner Dave Abbruzzese and the rest of the band), somewhat dull \\"Dissident\\" (the album's fourth single) and the true peak on the album, the driving \\"Rearviewmirror\\" would not have sounded out of place on \\"Ten\\".  \\"Rearviewmirror\\" is worthy of further attention, it never struck me for a long time how powerful the song is, but with its driving rhythms and venomous lyrics (\\"saw things so much clearer once you were in my rearview mirror\\"), it is one of the great pieces in the Pearl Jam catalog.  Proving their diversity, the band added to this a clean acoustic feel-- hit single \\"Daughter\\" (third on the album and a success without any video), with its loping feel, live favorite \\"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a small Town\\" and moody closer \\"Indifference\\" all show this sound.  The key to the future, however, lies in funky, bizarre, and totally brilliant lyrically \\"W.M.A.\\" defies description and precedent in the band's back catalog. <br /> <br />With this sort of fractured direction, however, I find the album largely fails to hang together well.  Everyone's got their favorite moments on it, and certainly its got some superb songs, but its overall an uneven effort.  Nonetheless, I'm sure almost anyone can find something to really enjoy on this one.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay have released another brilliant album. \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Fix You\\" are two of the best songs that Coldplay have ever released. They are comparable to Yellow and Clocks. This album certainly fits in line with the quality of their previous albums.
B0000508U6|2.0|I have listened to this album about 5 times now and I don't think I can listen to it anymore.  This band has about the dumbest, most trite, awful lyrics I've ever heard.  Dave Matthews has better lyrics, and theirs don't even make sense half the time. <br /> <br />Here are some sample lyrics from \\"Yellow\\": <br /> <br />I came along <br />I wrote a song for you <br />And all the things you do <br />And it was called yellow  <br /> <br />Wow, very deep.  The song was called Yellow?  OH MY GOD, that's the same name as this song?  Holy crap.  He should have called the song Bellow.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|The eighth DT album, Octavarium,  is much more diverse than its predecessor, the dark \\"Train of Thought\\". At first it appears less coherent than TOT, but after half a dozen listenings I can only appreciate the variety of moods DT so elegantly offer on this CD.  <br /> <br />The opening track, \\"The Root Of All Evil\\" is a hardrocker that could have been on TOT. In fact, there is a 15 second insert of \\"This Dying Soul\\" in the middle of the song. The second track, \\"The Answer Lies Within\\"  is to me a less impressive soft breather. Not really my cup of tea, but still a fine song when you're in the right mood. \\"These Walls\\" with its spacious sounds during the verse and melodic chorus over metal guitar sounds is quite radio friendly, and after hearing the U2-like \\"I Walk Beside You\\" the progrock enthusiast may wonder where this band is heading. These songs are certainly enjoyable, but not typical of DT. Especially so with the lack of  instrumental virtuoso passages typical of DT during tracks 2-4. But not to worry, the remaining four songs represent the diversified DT at their best. The hard rockin', up-tempo \\"Panic Attack\\" immeaditely became one of my all time DT favourite songs even before it got to the awesome solo sections by Rudess and Petrucci. \\"Never Enough\\" with ethereal vocals of LaBrie climaxes with a beautiful guitar passage towards the end. The epic \\"Sacificed Sons\\" deals with the 9/11 tragedy. After starting off smoothly the song builds up to typical DT characteristics. The title track is a 24 minute epic starting off with soft soundscapes featuring only keyboards and guitar. This intro sounds like Pink Floyd, later like Yes. LaBrie comes in at 5+ minutes and the song enters an instrumental pre-climax at 12+ minutes. We hear - among other things - (early)Genesis/Marillion-like keyboard passages and later, after further vocal parts, Zappa-influenced instrumental exercises. This piece of work grows on every listening and - although it after a mere 5 listenings may not appear very compact - is an all time DT's epic classic candidate.  <br /> <br />As with any DT album, the musicianship amazes. The musical style and songs on some DT records may not have made justice to James LaBrie's abilities, but on this record his versatility has to be appreciated in a big way. Despite my one ore two worries during the first playback of this CD I feel now that this is an essential piece of work by DT. If you are new to Dream Theater, the musical diversity makes this CD a good introduction of the band alongside with \\"Images and Words\\", which may require less listenings for full appreciation.
B000002AZ8|2.0|Two albums under their belt, Pearl Jam returned to the studio with Brendan O'Brien to record their densest and most difficult album of their career-- the band appeared to have little idea how it wanted to pursue the future, and it shot off in a dozen directions.    The material works best when Vedder seems to be fully behind the material-- his slab of rage on \\"Not For You\\" (a thematic continuation of \\"Blood\\" and the second single from the album), the delicate beauty of loss in \\"Nothingman\\", the story of broken love and hidden emotions of \\"Better Man\\" (originally discussed for \\"Vs.\\" but kept off that LP by Vedder and never released as a single although it received plenty of airplay), but even some topics that are a little less \\"deep\\"-- vinyl worship (the breakneck paced leadoff single \\"Spin the Black Circle\\"), a jacket (\\"Corduroy\\") all work really well.    The album does dribble out pretty inconsistently,however.  Sometimes it works out ok (\\"Tremor Christ\\", the haunting third single from the album \\"Immortality\\", the bizarre but somehow successful \\"Aye Davanita\\"), sometimes its a big mess (\\"Whipping\\", accordian workout \\"Bugs\\", the thoroughly annoying-- though brief-- \\"Pry, To\\").  I don't think there's really anyone who likes the whole album.    This is also the first Pearl Jam album to feature interesting artwork-- utilizing a book of health from who knows when as its booklet and contained in a then-revolutionary digipack, \\"Vitalogy\\" certainly looks better than most CDs.    The bottom line with this one is that it is not an album that is easy to digest, its got its inconsistent value, but its one of the less essential pieces by the band.
B00005JNEI|5.0|When this documentary came out, I pooh-poohed it. I just knew this Michael Moore was nothing but a trouble maker, and that he should have spent his time on other better projects. <br /> <br />Then, my daughter promised she would take me to dinner if I would only see it with her.  <br /> <br />When the camera honed in on Bush sitting in the class room reading \\"my pet goat\\", and then he found out about the second plane hitting the WTC, I expected to see him jump out of his chair and rush out of the room. I certainly would have seen Al Gore do this, and I expected no less from Bush. He sat there, biting his lip and shaking his head in acknowldegement, whether he intended it to be that obvious or not. <br /> <br />I was glued to the edge of my seat from then on. <br /> <br />Mike Moore's use of scenes, while documenting what was happening throughout the film was superb. I had to hand it to him for showing scenes that we, as Americans, were not shown on National Television, or in our local Newspapers. <br /> <br />When the film ended, I sat and bawled like a baby. I knew right then that this Country had been lied to and duped worse than any other dictator had ever done before in the history of this World; and he did it right under our sleeping noses. That is what I was the most angry about. <br /> <br />I, after almost a year, would still recommend this documentary along with his \\"Bowling for Columbine.\\" <br /> <br />Wow! Mike Moore rocks and I was above elation when Fahrenheit 9/11 won the People's Choice Award.
0385338082|4.0|I thought this was a fun read and hard to put down. It was a nice change after reading the whole Shopaholic Series. Actually I could picture this book becoming a movie at some point...
B00000J2SP|5.0|First Rainbow singer was Ronnie James Dio, which is just my favorite singer all time. Then Graham bennot came, an average singer. The songs on 'Down to Earth' are not bad, but I didn't liked his voice so very much. But after all that: 'Difficult to Cure'! I love that album! There are some poppish songs, but I don't mind. I love those songs. Joe Lynn Turner is a very good singer(better then Bennot). The guitar work is also very good. Ritchie Blackmore(best guitarist ever) plays as good as usualy. The keyboardplay is very good too, listen to 'Spotlight Kid' and you know why. My favorite songs on this album are: 'I Surrender', 'Spotlight Kid', 'No Release' and 'Can't Happen here'. the other songs are very good too. Except for 'Vielleicht Das Nachste Mal'. That song is a bit boring, listenable, bit a bit boring. I like the instrumental song 'Difficult to Cure'. That's a cover of beethovens 9th.  <br />Well well, I hope I helped you with my review. I really recommend this album to anyone. If you know rainbow or if you dont know rainbow, it doesn't matter, just buy this album.
B000002BFZ|4.0|After three albums, throwing out their drummer, and recording a record with Neil Young, Pearl Jam went back into the studio and produced something... different.  Whether it is the presence of Jack Irons at the drum kit, working with Young, or just a continuation of what they were doing on \\"Vitalogy\\" but more focused is unclear to me.  Still, \\"No Code\\" stands out as the most unique album Pearl Jam has recorded. <br /> <br />Before talking about what's new, a note aobut what's old-- the influence of \\"Vitalogy\\", particularly on the heavier material, is evident here-- following in vein of \\"Spin the Black Circle\\", \\"Not For You\\", and \\"Whipping\\" are the compulsive and powerful \\"Hail, Hail\\" and the concise and brilliant \\"Lukin\\" (in just over a minute it tells a whole story and comes back around).  But there's some other work on here that reminds of the past-- the lyrically inventive \\"Habit\\" and the acoustic \\"Off He Goes\\"-- that can't quite live up to the past.  These pieces could have come off of \\"Vitalogy\\" easily enough but wouldn't have stood out on that record. <br /> <br />But its the difference that this record is known for, an almost Eastern vibe comes through in \\"Who You Are\\" and \\"In My Tree\\" (hinted at by \\"Vitalogy\\"'s \\"Aye Davanita\\").  The former is somewhat lifeless (and a poor choice for a leadoff single), the latter is among the best Pearl Jam has ever recorded-- circular drum pattern, superb vocals, and a clever, subtle arrangement.  Ditto for the more western \\"Present Tense\\" and the totally bizarre and funky \\"Smile\\", both of which stand strong on the record. <br /> <br />But a few songs are a bit unbalanced-- the moody \\"Sometimes\\" and the unexciting \\"Red Mosquito\\" (which does feature a nice creamy lead guitar line but lacks any real bite).  And while Stone Gossard's lead vocal on \\"Mankind\\" is passable, the song itself is more a novelty than something interesting for me.  The totally bizarre, trancey, and mostly spoken \\"I'm Open\\" works better as an experiment, the hazes established in it are lovely, and Vedder's sung vocals are incredible. <br /> <br />An uneven but bold album, \\"No Code\\" is definitely worth a listen-- some folks swear by this one (I'm one of the ones who swears by \\"Riot Act\\"), you may be one of them, but I'd start somewhere else.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Hum...so this is the third SOAD album. I remember quite well when the first album came out. Pretty amazing: new sound, great lyrics. All in all, very refreshing. The follow-up Toxicity was also very good; always difficult fo a band to match the expectancies. Especially when the first album is such a phenomenon. Anyway they managed to do so without the shadow of a doubt. They decided to release two albums this year instead of a double or maybe just one CD with maybe a little smaller set-list. Why? This one lasts 36 min which is correct but a little bit short and if the second is of the same length, or close to, I bet the only reason why they decided to release two CD is to make more money on the kids (even though the CD is not very expensive...). What about the content in itself. What is clear from the first time you listen to it is that they spent a lot of time on the production (with the help of Rick Rubin). And the second thing that is obvious is the fact that they spent much less time on the lyrics which suck (except for 3-4 songs). The structure of the songs is not in itself quite original event though it's really clean and Daron/Serj are really good singers, able to perform on a broad scale of intensities and feelings. One thing is sure: you won't miss the chorus as it comes back every 20 seconds with mainly nothing in-betweem which makes the songs very easy to remember from the first time you listen to the album. This makes it very addictive and you just can't help yourself singing the different things for several days. Doesn't this mean it's a good album? No, this just mean that the production is so clean that you get bored after 10 to 15 listenings (my case). When I listen to it carefully (and I did believe me) I wonder how they managed to do something so clean. I have the impression that they played the riffs once and then made copy/paste as many time as necessary. The word I have for that is OVER-PRODUCED. That's what this album is. Don't say it's bad butit's not something you can listen hundreds of time. There is no place left for your imagination; nothing hidden that you could still discover after 20 or 30 times, there is nothing more than what you hear. One more thing: there are 11 songs. OK good. The first is just an intro (1 min), nothing really fun, the 10th is probably one of the worst song I've ever heard and the 11th even though interesting is of no special interest with regards to the lyrics, the same holds true for the 4th and 6th. So you end up with 6 good songs (didn't say the lyrics of all those ones were interesting either; the topic of Radio/Video is quite common and biting the hand that feeds you is not glorious). <BR>Well, maybe I'm too old (much closer to 30 than 20) now to really appreciate. I'm convinced that the kids will enjoy and say it's the best rock album ever and that SOAD are geniuses. I would rather say that SOAD know how to make good songs for the kids. But this album won't remain on the long haul.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Unlike a few others I've seen, I didn't have Who's Next on cd until I bought the deluxe edition.  I am extremely happy that I waited.  I have loved the Who's Next album for over 20 years and see great value in this edition.  That includes songs that appear 2 or even 3 times.  If you are a Who fanatic and see value in both Leeds and Isle of Wight Festival (as well as Charlton 74 and others if you can get ahold of them), then this if for you. <br />Besides one of the greatest albums of all time and some outtakes, we get a CD of the Who in a casual live setting.  The songs come alive with the Who in thier natural element.  They were one of the most amazing live bands ever, and this shows the live energy with concise, tight renditions of songs. <br />If the prospect of this CD does not immediately thrill you, then it might not be for you.  Buy one of the several Greatest Hits collections and rent \\"The Kids are Alright\\".  That may bring you running back for more.
B00097A5HW|5.0|This album is going to be to Latin music - and to world music in general - what Layla and Sgt Pepper were to rock, what Kind Of Blue was to jazz: a defining moment, a piece of work that takes  the most diverse musical influences (folklore, Brazilian <br />moods as well as rock, jazz, disco) and turns it into something  <br />completely of its own; the record even starts with a bit of chanson francaise. Shakira is completely inimitable, hers <br />is the most erotic voice to be found in contemporary popular music, hers is the gift to write poetic, never trite lyrics. At a time when the music industry hails bloodless music as as a revelation, Shakira's album is a lesson in creativity.
B000002BYD|5.0|Often regarded, perhaps unfairly, as the \\"normal\\" album that followed \\"No Code\\", \\"Yield\\" is a beast all of its own.  What it does display is a band that's really come into itself-- whereas it felt that \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\" was Pearl Jam escaping their legacy and finding their own feet, \\"Vitalogy\\" was a search for a direction, and \\"No Code\\" was the push out, \\"Yield\\" is in many ways the beginning of the band's second phase-- they know who they are and what kind of music they want to play. <br /> <br />\\"Yield\\" has many of the elements of thre preivously albums finally coexisting-- the AOR/arena rock sound (leadoff single \\"Given to Fly\\"), the punk numbers in the vein of \\"Go\\", \\"Last Exit\\", and \\"Hail Hail\\" (powerful opener \\"Brain of J\\"), the ballads vocalist Ed Vedder can really get himself wrapped into (\\"Low Light\\"), but its got a lot more too. <br /> <br />Any belief that this is a straightahead rock record only, take a look at \\"No Way\\" or \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\", with its odd fills (from various instruments) and falsetto harmonies, or the churning, bubbling \\"Wishlist\\"-- a final realization of the sort of sounds \\"Who You Are\\" and \\"In My Tree\\" leaned towards, although with a self-assurance that allows it to speak on its own.  And certainly little on this or any other record can compare to the ecstatic power of \\"Do the Evolution\\"-- lyrically and musically one of the most (if not THE most) satisfying songs in Pearl Jam's catalog.  Straightahead rock?  When all the instruments drop out but the drums and Vedder leads the choir singing \\"Alleluia\\"? <br /> <br />Still, if its straightahead rock you're after, look no further than \\"MFC\\"-- a great song about hitting the open road and a fantastic piece.  The thing about this album is that its got something for anyone who's enjoyed any of Pearl Jam's earlier albums.  Confidence, synthesis of sounds, and a settled direction all help to make this one an essential part of the band's catalog.  Recommended.
B0008ISM40|4.0|Somewhere between downward spiral and the fragile. Nothing really new however. Some songs could have been on one or the other of these two albums. This implies that the present one does not have a strong specific sound, it's a shame. But, hey, it's not easy to be Trent Reznor! It's clear that the guy spent days and months working on it and it's very impressive. There are multiple layers for each song, some you hear clearly and others that take many listenings to just begin to uncover. At least this is a CD that you will listen for a lot of time 'cause there are many facets. Thus even if not a major release for NIN it should be quite enough for every NIN fan to spend his money!
B000063T0T|3.0|I'm very open to new types of music and films. When I first saw Moulin Rouge, it had wonderful music. It wasn't what I expected and I was blown away. Buuuuut this cd that I purchased didn't contain all the music that I had hoped for. The first cd had a majority of the good songs but the second one had the minority. Total waste of money. Still, I liked some of the music but I felt cheated when they didn't include some of the others. I wouldn't say that I'm not fully disappointed but I am. Guess I should of stuck with Andrew Lloyd Webber.  U_U
0195067142|5.0|This man exemplifies the citizen soldier of WWII. This kind and gentle man left the comforts of university life and played a roll in the most horrific theater of the war. He didn't let it influence him to the point that he was disfunctional but realized that he had a job to do and God willing, if he came back, he would look at things a little differently. He did just that.Eugene Sledge will always have my deepest appreciation and all those who were with him will have the same. Thank you Mr. Sledge for making the sacrifice and my bed a bit warmer. This is a must read.

0802130208|4.0|A Confederacy of Dunces is fascinating not just for its very interesting background story or its masterful wit and phrasing: part of the greatness here is that most of us (I think?) have encountered some intellectual who, like Ignatius, seems to be attached to some better time or philosophy, constantly offended by the frivolity and lack of dignity of modernity. His sense of superiority and disapproval will induce belly laughs if you have ever associated with college undergrads who aspire to be serious academics.<br />Myrna Minkoff, our hero's object of disgust/love is a caricature of espresso swilling, nietzche quoting college girls who are \\"just doing it for the cause\\" (or maybe just feel important...)<br />If you are a student or a medievalist, if you have ever been oppressed by that vixen Fortuna or known yourself to have a rich Inner Life that the philistines around you would clearly be incapable of understanding, the book will be a sure favorite.
B0006L16N8|5.0|You can't go wrong with this album.  This album is truely priceless.  This album gives you something to talk about and sleep to.  This album is so soothing.  X and Y tops most of there earlier stuff.   <br /> <br />* The pianos on this album are really good.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes soothing music.  It makes you more 'vulnerable' to most of the soft music out there.  Do not hesitate and think about whether or not to get this.  You will regret not getting this today.  Buy and enjoy. <br /> <br />* I think the best song on the album is 'Hardest Part' and many people would agree.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I'll try to be about as objective as I can when writing this. I've been listening to an advance copy of this for a few weeks now and being a huge A7X fan (I'd go as far as to call Waking The Fallen the best album of 03) I had huge expectations for this album. The first four or five times I listened to City Of Evil I absolutely hated it. It remains to be seen whether or not M.Shadows can really scream or not anymore (what will they do live with the old material I wonder?) but I find it hard to believe that they would make up a story about him having damaged vocal chords just to cover themselves with making a fairly drastic change in their music to satisfy Warner Bros. so I'll believe the story unless proven otherwise. Remember, Warner Bros. has released a lot of \\"aggressive music,\\" atleast by mainstream standards in the past including Glassjaw and Static-X.  <br /> <br />By far the biggest problems with the album are in the vocal department and the lyrics. M.Shadows can still carry a pretty catchy chorus like in the past but where things really fall apart is his vocal work in the verses (see Burn It Down and Blinded In Chains). It comes off as like \\"ok, this is normally where M.Shadows would be screaming so what are we going to do now? Yeah, ok, just do that. We'll make it work\\" Very sloppy.  <br /> <br />So what saves this album from being a complete dud and yet another major label release failure? Well, as much as I hate to admit in, in a world where \\"heavy\\" music is plagued by thousands of metalcore (which I can still be a sucker for) and post-hardcore whiners this is a pretty unique sounding release by all standards. City Of Evil ultimately meets in between the middle of being an almagamation of thrash metal, power metal, and punk and if you want something that is very un-metalcore/hardcore, then this would be it. Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeances' guitar work is stellar and completely saves this album (see Strength Of The World and Sidewinder) and The Rev's drumming is stepped up a notch (see Trashed And Scattered). You even hear Johnny Christ trail off onto his own a few times with his bass work.  <br /> <br />There are however a few tracks that just don't seem to really connect at all, mostly Betrayed (a song written and dedicated to the late Dimebag Darrell of Pantera/Damageplan fame) and M.I.A. Seize The Day is a bit of a power ballad that I've heard be compared to Guns N' Roses(which I've never liked ever) but moves  along very much like Warmness Of The Soul, but no where near as good. The album is packed (clocking in at an hour and twelve minutes) and some of the songs are probably longer than they really should be but I'd rather be it longer than it should be than shorter tha n what we would have wanted. So what is the best track on the album? Above and beyond, Strength Of The World is by far the strongest track on the album. A7X really flexed their muscles and added lots of nice little surprises on this track that I'll let you hear for yourself. Beast And The Harlot and Trashed And Scattered also feel more familiar to their older material despite the obvious missing intensity of M.Shadows vocals. <br /> <br />As much as nobody wants to admit it, the artwork and packaging is just as much of an extension of an album as anything. The cover artwork is great and unlike just about anything out there in the mainstream music world and the layout of the booklet wasn't something that was just slapped together.  <br /> <br />Altogether, there is probably a silver lining (atleast to the band) to the entire vocal departure of M.Shadows as this album will probably catapult them into mainstream popularity alongside bands like My Chemical Romance (which then it will definetly no longer be \\"cool\\" to like them). By far their most accessible release and no where near as good as any of their previous material, it still stands hundred times better than most of the garbage that is played on TV and on the the radio (The Used, HawthorneHeights, and all these other horrible pop punk bands-I'm talking to you!) and I've decided that not only do I like this album, but I can handle all the success their bound to achieve with it. I'd rather see these guys faces plastered all over the place than the trash thats popular now, and you should too.
B0007M22TI|5.0|The DVD gets 5 stars cause now I can see the fiddle player! The CD is great to hear the music but the spirit of the live DVD is excellent. The celtic girls do a great job along with the many many people on stage. This is an impressive a production as I've seen since Sara Brightman...since I saw them on the Today show in March I've been looking forward to seeing this. Not disappointed. <br /> <br />Some people here seem to think you either have to be or not be into Celtic music to enjoy this or not...why not just enjoy it for really good songs and music? At least this stuff never gets boring!
B00097A5HW|3.0|Shaki! Shaki! I don't understand a single thing she's saying on this record, and I love it. She's really branched out and at the same time solidified her sound w/this new record. Very good all around: nice, easy ballads; fun party tunes; nice ass-shakers. Good stuff. I can't wait for Part II - the English version!
B00005U122|5.0|A performance that was very,very well put together. I just got it in 2005,. Wish I new it was available sooner. From the song selection ( listed in above reviews )to the overall stage performances a MUST for Roger Waters fans. Roger's stage performance is laid back and he is very much aware of his counterparts exceptional performances. Roger himself is incredible in his way of singing the playset. Not to take away from anyone in this concert. The three women on the background vocals capture Water's interpretation of his lyrics to the tee. <br /> From start to finsh a complete and fulfilling DVD to have even if you never listened to Floyd or Roger. The two songs from The Final Cut were my favs, cause that album to me is one of the best ever released. Mother,and Wish You Were Here brought chills to my body, and yes maybe tears.  If you don't have this concert you are certainly missing something speicial. <br />     <br />             Love ya Roger God bless <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Remember these words: This album will be remembered as the most important, historic and impressive of the year. X & Y is the best song I've ever heard since Radiohead's Sit Down Stand Up. Everytime I hear both songs I get chills throughout my body for about 15 minutes. AMAZING. <br /> <br />IMO this album is the finest moment of any British band since Ok Computer. Its a masterpiece, unparalleled soul-spilling, the soundtrack of a life. Cheers.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I really liked this CD, my Irish music collection ranges from The Chieftains to The Corrs and I can't quite figure out where this one fits in. It's more classical crossover than Irish and yet it manages to sound celtic....maybe some people will find it hard to pidgeon hole but it really works for me. To behonest I have had enough jigs and reels for hours and hours for a while!! <br />Love the girls voices, totally honest, not big dramatics or anything, cool too. <br /> <br />I'd have given it 5 start if there was more of the fiddle player!! Maybe next time... <br /> <br />Overall a very cool mix.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|in the begining i had a lot of apprehension about this film.  since i'd only kind of liked pink floyd and i'd heard the film was really dumb and only made sense if you were really tripping on drugs.  but nonetheless i picked up this dvd one day out of curiousity.  (which, by the way, was very resonably priced...what are all of you going one about?.  Anyway i loved it!  though the music is hardly floyd's best, there are some very good songs.  what i loved most was the amazing imagery and the plot.  this movie is deep, but not \\"dude....that's deep\\" deep.  it just makes sense if you're intellegent.  which stoners generally arn't so i don't see how they \\"get\\" this movie.  i give huge props to Alan Parker for his adaptaion of the record to the screen.  and i positively love Bob Geldof's acting, he's a very talented actor.  all in all this movie is dark and meaningful.  as well as beautiful and intrigueing.  Regardless of wether or not you like pink  floyd you should see this - if only to expand your thinking a little.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I have been a Dream Theater fan for about four years now an I tell you, they seem to not be capable of doing any wrong on there albums. This album is a great mixture of different sounds they have used throughout there career, very oldchool prog with some Yes and King Crimson influences, to new-school style with alot of sounds undiscovered by any other band. The Contiueum (spelling) during the intro to the title track is amazing! So pick this up. This is surely the best album of 2005.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|Im not sure that the 1st few tracks are all that great- when I 1st heard the album I found myself wandering, not even paying attention to the music- after the 2nd song was over, I started to get pulled in. I think that this is a good cd overall but the begining kinda stinks. The 1st song is a lot of 4/4 rythem, and just an average rock song, the 2nd song is slow and somewhat meaningless- but again- the cd picks up- and there are some great songs- must buy for DT fans, but if your new to DT may I suggest Scenes from a Memory-
B00005R62K|5.0|What a great classic priest album!  If you're a fan of metal, especially the late '70s/early '80s variety, this album should definitely be part of your collection.   <br /> <br />I was always a fan of Priest's painkiller-style music, but when I heard Stained Class (along with Sin after Sin, Sad Wings, Defenders, etc.) I was hooked.  It just doesn't get any better.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I usually listen to more proggy stuff, bands like Dream Theater, Symphony X, Adagio, Rhapsody, etc. But I have been a fan of A7X. Sounding the Seven trumpets was pretty good and Waking the Fallen was awesome, but in my eyes they always held back musically what I knew they were capable of doing. This album shows a definate maturity. Even though M. Shadows can no longer scream his voice is good enough to not need that useless element in music, therefore I think he sounds much better. This album is great for fans of any kind of metal, whether it be prog, power, death, or even the crappy state of metalcore. Just give it a chance.
B0006L16N8|3.0|the title of coldplay's new album \\"X&Y\\" unknowingly presents itself for evaluation in linear form.  let's assume that \\"x\\" represents each track number and \\"y\\" represents the quality of each track (out of 10), so that a graph would illustrate an overall rating of the album.  after listening, the equation is therefore y = mx + b where m = 0 and b = 7.5.  what does this mean?  it means there is no slope (i.e. no variance) to this line.  it means that there a constant of semi-decent music moving at an unflinching pace (75%), but with uber-simplistic and entirely safe lyrics written most likely by the winner of a local third grade poetry contest.  it means that EVERY COLDPLAY SONG ON THIS ALBUM SOUNDS THE SAME, IS GENERIC, AND EARNS A FAT \\"C\\" IN MY BOOK. <br /> <br />
B0009KA7BS|1.0|To get to the point very quickly, the movie was a letdown. It tries to be a mixture of horror, suspends and action but it just ends up very uneven in it's narrative and you just lose patience with it after while. Keanu Reeves is simply miscast in the lead role and he turns in a very tired and lackluster performance that does drag the movie down a lot. The character he plays is also a problem because he's such a whiney jerk and you just really can't stand him at all. You are left wondering on why he's even in the film in the first place because he character really adds nothing to the story other than the stereo typical climax where he flexes his muscles in order to fight the bad guys. The rest of the characters in the film don't fair any better with the exception of Rachel Weisz, who manages to turn in a great performance despite having Keanu Reeves making a fool out of himself right next to her. She gives this movie a real sense of earthy realism and unnecessary creditability with a performance that deserved a better movie. Djmon Hounsou is decent in a glorified cameo that really does not use his talents to it's full potential and Shia LaBeouf is doing his lame slapstick to the hill. The man or woman who played the angel Gabriel was strange looking to say the least and Satan himself looked like he just came from a Vegas lounge act. I do have to say that the special effects were pretty good and the hell dimension had it's charm but nether of them can compensate for a bad script that not only has some really bad dialog that makes some of the scenes in the film unintentional funny but has a plot development that makes no sense what so ever and has noting to do with the story as a whole. The movie has it's good points, which is the performance of Rachel Weisz and the stunning special effects but the bad far out weight the good with a tired performance by Keanu Reeves, some unintentional funny scenes with some really bad dialog and a plot development that should have been left on the cutting room floor.
B0006L16N8|5.0|My friends, this is the first Coldplay's perfect album. I have no words to explain what I feel when I listen to those dramatic pianos and string sections that works to enhance the beauty of Martin's original compositions. And all the songs are pretty damn great actually!.  <br /> <br />I have to be honest and I discovered Coldplay when they released A Rush Of Blood To The Head, because a friend borrowed me Parachutes by the time they released their second album and I never really was a huge fan of it. I simply couldn't stand Everything's not lost. I think A Rush Of Blood To The Head was a much better album. <br /> <br />Now waiting is over with this masterwork. It's as close to perfection as music gets.  <br />Hazy is the word, the music really matches the feel of the lyrics. Its more cohesive than their 2 previous albums. A tremendous work has been done here. My title review says it all: The Best Of Coldplay. <br /> <br />
B0009AM5JA|5.0|Without a doubt the best Coldplay album to date. Some things are definitely worth waiting for.
6304698526|5.0|I am old enough to remember when Bullitt came out.  Steve was making the talk show circuit pitching the movie.  Of couse they mentioned the chase scene. It helped sell the movie but did not seem like such a big deal at the time.  There were lots of movies before it with chase scenes.  The thing that changed Hollywood for the next 25 years or so was that : A. the cars were filmed at real speed - 100 mph+. Before this they either speeded up the cameras and did not have other cars in the scene so it looked like the car was going fast although it was not or they had the \\"stars\\" in a car on the set and a fake back gound in back of them and all the stars had to remember was to turn the steering wheels once in a while.  Such as Hollywood stardom and lack of care in editing that they were as likely as not to turn the wheel in the wrong direction than the road in the background would indicate they shoud turn it. B.  there was a real star behind the wheel at speed. Steve put an end to all of of the fake stuff. Never again would an audiance be fooled by the fakeness (until the 1990's when computer generated chase scenes would take over.) So 1968 - 1990 or so was the golden age for car chase scenes - real cars on real roads at real speeds going real fast and with the very occasional real star behind the wheel (Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, James Garner).  Now we come to Steve though.  He was a real motor cycle racer - he also raced a Porsche 917 at Le Mans and made the movie Le Mans which is the best racing movie ever made (Grand Prix with James Garner the second best. So he was the genuine article and according to docmentaries that I have seen hated it when the movie sudios would make him accept a stunt double - he was too valuable to risk according to them, not to Steve.  The best scene in the chase sequence has Steve missing a turn up a hill and smoking the tire (as apposed to tires - no posi traction) up the hill.  According to the documantry, this was a mistake.  Steve was actually driving the car and missed his turn to go up the hill.  He was so pissed that he jammed the transmission into reverse and smoked the tire while the the wheel jumped around wildly in the wheel well - (Mustangs had live rear axles in those days - still do unless you opt for the Cobra) and then when positioned for the hill let out the clutched at high RPMs and let er' rip burning rubber all the way up the hill.  The director wisely kept the \\"mistake\\" in the film and it is maybe the best part of the chase scene.  Sure there are some mistakes like the Charger seems to loose something like six of its four hugcaps.  Still it is better than the worst chase scene something like Sylvester Stalone's Get Carter where in the course of the chase the Cadillac starts somehow reparing itself so that the head light that had been bashed out 2 minutes before has fixed its body work and a minute later is turned on.  Sort of like a chase scent in reverse.  The Cadillac starts out smashed up and ends up in near show room condition after the chase. Who was the film editor on this film again? Did anybody bother to watch it before it was released? Hmm that is OK though -it is not as Bad as Slys' racing movie Driven where race cars start going the opposite direction on the track.  Oh well - there are those actors who merely show up to speak lines and there are those that are truly engaged in what they are doing.  Steve got chased form the Le Mans track by security because he was trying to take pictures of the racing cars  three or four inches from the track tarmack while they went by at 200+ MPH.  His best line from Le Mans.  \\"To men who do it well, racing is life, everything else is just waiting\\". God, I miss him.ctually driving the car and missed his turn to go up the hill.

1573223026|4.0|As comic novels go, this book takes on a frightfully tricky subject: suicide. <br />On New Years Eve in North London, four lost souls go to a roof of a particularly famous suicide point called Toppers House to leap  only to discover a traffic jam (themselves), and, instead of jumping, end up striking up an uneasy alliance/friendship. (Even though we had nothing in common beyond that one thing, as the character Martin states at one point.) Thats the high-concept opening and theme of this novel, in a nutshell.<br />The four characters:<br />MARTIN: a disgraced, morning talk-show host who served time in jail for sleeping with an underage girl. Divorced by his wife, humiliated by the media.<br />MAUREEN: a middle-aged, self-sacrificing (and long-suffering) single mom whose only son is a virtual vegetable. A Catholic who states (p. 77): I dont believe in luck as much as punishment. She had sex once, with only one man  which resulted in a child, the cross she had to bear (and could no longer bear).<br />JESS: a bratty, impulsive, volatile, foul-mouthed rebel teen, daughter of a well-known government official.<br />JJ: a 30-ish failed American musician (leader of the defunct cult band, Big Yellow)  now turned pizza delivery boy. (A character most resembling Rob from High Fidelity)<br />The novel is told from the point of view of these four characters  that is, in alternating monologues (reminding me of William Faulkners As I Lay Dying  one of Oprahs Summer picks). <br />At one point a significant reference is made to Virginia Woolfs To The Lighthouse, in which the character of Jess suggests the author killed herself because she couldnt make herself understood.<br />Whats unfolds then, in this novel, is the characters finding the WORDS to their despair.<br /> WHAT I LOVED:<br />The humor. Given this horribly dark subject matter, Nick Hornby continually finds a way to make his material and situations amusing.<br />WHAT I DIDNT LOVE:<br />Finding this horribly dark subject matter amusing.<br />Part of the problem with Nick Hornby is that he is a comic novelist in the traditional sense. (As with Shakespeares comedies, it is the happy ending that defines it as such.)<br />I kept thinking that this novel might work better as a play or a skit. The opening on the roof is very theatrical, almost like a Samuel Beckett play (full of gallows humor). There rest of the book, essentially, is a series of monologues. <br />Some people may find A Long Way Down a little shallow, a little contrived and glib, like a TV sitcom run amok. Hornby constantly undermines the seriousness of his subject matter in order to make it bearable; but in doing so he also undermines the weight of it; in a way, he sort of paints himself into a corner from the beginning. The rest of the novel is about Hornby writing himself out of the hole. Give him credit for courage, though.<br />All the negative aspects aside -- there are A LOT of laugh-out-loud passages in this book; theres enough humor and wit and liveliness for me to recommend it. His writing is still a pleasure to read, his characters full of attitude and intensely likeable, and after The Losers Club: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez (another recent Amazon favorite of mine), Im still recommending Nick Hornbys A Long Way Down. Maybe not his best -- High Fidelity still commands that spot -- but still good, a comic novel stretching the limits of what a comic novel should be.
0380778556|5.0|\\"I put Manderley first, before anything else. And it does not prosper, that sort of love.\\" So says Maximilian de Winter, the handsome and wealthy master of the house and country estate so named. After the sudden death of his beautiful and accomplished wife, Rebecca, de Winter flees to Monaco. He astonishes both himself and the book's nameless narrator by marrying that narrator just weeks after meeting her. The new Mrs. de Winter is barely out of school, and so poor that she's in Monaco as paid companion to an obnoxious widow. Does Maxim really love her? Or is he simply unable to bear returning alone to his beloved Manderley, with Rebecca no longer there?<br /><br />The young second wife is out of her depth socially and economically, feeling far more kinship with her husband's staff of servants than with his friends. Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper who came to Manderley when Rebecca was Maxim's bride, realizes that immediately and takes full advantage. Mrs. Danvers adored Rebecca, and hates the woman who now occupies her place at Manderley. Which Rebecca seems never to have left, after all....<br /><br />I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It's beautifully written, with rich detail and a slow, subtle building of menace that's ultimately far more creepy than modern \\"in-your-face\\" scare-fests ever manage. I especially like the flaws in Du Maurier's heroes, and the sympathetic qualities of her villians. Not only does that make the characters, all of them, more realistic; it also matches the novel's start-to-finish ambiguity. In a lesser writer's hands that ambiguity might come off as unsatisfying, but Du Maurier manages to strike exactly the right note. Especially - where it matters most - on the final page.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is ultimately THE best Coldplay album. x & y contains moments of sheer beauty, inspired music, honest lyrics and song writing skills. A pleasant listen.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|What can I say, this album is awesome, I still prefer Scenes from a memory pt. 2, but this rates as one of my favourite DT albums. For those of you who didn't like train of thought you will probably like this more. I'm not quite sure who did the orchestral parts of this album, most likely Jordan Ruddess, but i remember John Petrucci mentioning he wanted to use a guitar synth    <br />to simulate chello sounds and stuff in a magazine interview. <br /> <br />Here are some brief overviews of some of the songs <br /> <br />1.The Root Of All Evil - Starts off a bit Electro but then moves away from it. Mostly 4 4 throughout, i think so much effects processing on the vocals was a tad over done, but the vocals are over done. There are rememenants of This dying soul (from train of thought) in places (eg. where you hear \\"i can feel my body breaking...\\") <br /> <br />2.The Answer Lies Within - This is a gentle rock ballad. Think 'solitary shell' (Six Degree's of inner turbulance). Nice piano parts, <br /> <br />3.These Walls - I liked this intro as it's quite unusual(sort of like a guitar on heavy distortion with pick slides slowed down), It sounds like it has a bunch of effects applied to it as it slows down and then up. After this it goes into a nice riff and ths song starts. All 4 4 i think, nice song in general has a lot of keyboard parts which is good to hear because sometimes i feel petrucci's parts over power ruddess's parts. <br /> <br />4.I Walk Beside You - Starts of with a chunging guitar rhythm and the tick, tock clock sound from scenes from memory pt.2. It feels like there's a coldplay influence in this song, one part sounds a lot like the song clocks. Nice backing vocals from the band in this as well. It feels like a heavier rock ballad to me, again this I think is all 4 4 (i think portnoy is doing his special stuff for track 8). <br /> <br />5.Panic Attack - Amazing intro, sounds like John Myung is getting very good on the chapman stick. I think he is playing atwo handed pattern. Starts in 4 4 and then moves to 6 8 (the 6 8 section sounds a bit like \\"jaws of life\\" on John Petrucci's new solo album). Great track, i think there is a MUSE influence in this track as well with the vocals about 4 minutes into the song (the lyrics include the word hysteria (name of a muse song)). The song ends a bit weird, repeating the ending accent (that has been sampled).Then after that this weird electric thing starts <br /> <br />6.Never Enough - The intro is \\"Another\\" desending Natural Minor scale pattern, A bit like in a \\"a change of seasons\\" but faster. The lyrics and the music seem to be a MUSE style in places. <br /> <br />7.Sacrificed Sons - Starts with Islamic prayers and then political and news quotes come in, this is similar to \\"The Great Debate\\" (six Degree's of Inner Turbulance). This seems to be themed around September 11th, sucide bombings and Jihad. I know there is more to it, but i have not really analysed the lyrics yet. Nice tempo and time signature changes. <br /> <br />8.Ocatavirum - This is my favourite track, the song starts of very chilled and does not change till 3:48.At this point Portnoy enters and then after a few bars, petrucci comes in with the acoustic guitar and a flute sound plays a melody over the top. Then at 5:12 the song changes with petrucci playing a different acoustic rhythm (which sounds minor), lyrics and drums enter hear aswell. Then at 7:54 it changes feel again (major key probably) and after it dies again, it goes into one of the coolest bits of the song (8:45). It sounds a little like \\"chris and kevin's excellent adventures\\" (liquid tension experiment 1) because it uses a Sixtuplet ghost noted beat from portnoy and a more dominant bass part. It would take to long to describe the rest of the song but i suggest you just listen to it's brilliance, I think this song overshadows every  other song on this album.
B000059GEI|5.0|i am not a marilyn monroe fan, and honestly, i love this movie in spite of her being in, not because of her being in it. dan dailey, donald o'connor, mitzi gaynor, and ethel merman were all wonderful in this movie. johnnie ray was not much of a dancer, but he had a good voice. i thought the musical numbers were all great-everyone was in top form in this film. you cannot go wrong in getting this one.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's 3rd album shows nothing but promise for the band called by some to be the \\"younger generations\\" U2. I, being part of that generation, cannot necessarily comment, but can say that this CD is worth EVERY cent. You've got your standard Coldplay ballad (Fix You) which is soaring, meloncholy, and does tug at your heartstrings (remeniscent of The Scientist). However, the new, electronically driven sound developing in the band is definately a treat. If you love Coldplay, you'll love this CD....If you've never tried them...you'll still find something to appeal to you, and once that has happened, you'll find that every song does grow on you as more nuances become evident with every listen.
B00005Y6YB|4.0|nothing can be said about this movie that you havent already heard.  If you havent seen it, shame on you.  if you dont own it, what are you waiting for?  the only thing that keeps this from getting my 5 stars is not in the movie itself, but in the poor sound and picture quality. (net even subtitles - you would think with the success they could have given us something as far as extras.) any other movie would have lost 2 stars over this but it is still Lonesome Dove...
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Al Pacino is one of my fav. actors ever, this and Godfather would have to be his best actoring skills he ever done.<br /><br />The movies mostly about a man who want I think wanted money or something from this guys but things went wrong and he lost a friend(Its been a while snice I seen this movie), then later on he meets a beautiful girl and he even gets a bunch of money. But he soon becomes a bit of an @ss to everyone. Its a very intersting movie, I would tell more but its been so long snice I seen it which is funny cause I own it.<br /><br />If you like Al Pacino or think adv. or shooting(near the ending) is intersting or very good then this is a movie to see. Al Pacino's acting is so well done.
B00008H2LB|4.0|when linkin park made hybrid theory they were still underground. then when they got big off that cd and made this, they made all the songs more radio friendly, chester doesnt scream like or as much and the songs are just not as angry as they were. there are still some really good songs but i cant go through the whole thing without skipping a single one like i could with HT. so if your really into linkin park like i was when i got this, you need to pick it up, but if you just like them for HT, you might want to leave this one alone.
6305949980|5.0|Tim Burton would have to be one of the most best directors out their. His works are very good. Nightmare Before Christmas would have to be one of his best movies he ever made.<br /><br />Jack(King of The Pumpkin Patch) trys to put Halloween and Christmas together which is a big mistake but he doesnt know it. Sally has a crush on him and trys to get him to notice her but hes to busy to notice with all his plans before Halloween comes up. Santa claus mets the boogymen and its just a masterpiece. If you like Tim Burton movies this is a must see movie. Its pure genius.
B00004Z459|5.0|linkin park was one of the the first bands i really got into. this cd is their best by far. its loud and pretty heavy (compared to meteora at least) there isnt any songs that i would skip. i really really hate rap but the rapping they do in this cd really didnt bug me much, probably because i knew that i would be followed up by an awesome riff and chester screaming his lungs out. i bought this cd a long time ago, around the time when it first came out and i still give a listen now and then.
B0000035E7|5.0|This is one of Nirvana's best works. I found out about Nirvana not to long ago from my Stepdad who burned a cd and put Nirvana's song \\"Smells Like Teen Spirt\\"(from Nevermind), and Ashley started to learn about Nirvana, downloading music, looking at pictures, and even inteviews she was obessed with Nirvana. I then started to like Nirvana.<br /><br />Kurt's voice was a bit raspy, and good at the same time. I was watching a video about how girls loved him for his looks and voices.Thats not the point though. Kurt was stoned most of his time so his lyrics when he was singing was hard to understand but when you read the lyrics their very dark. Nirvana was prob. one of the best Grunge bands ever. This is their best album if you like Nirvana or are just getting into them. This album is a must own.
B000069CWE|4.0|i loved hybrid theory and when i got this cd i wasnt quite sure what to expect. it has the same songs and i thought that the remixed versions were pretty cool after listening to the originals so much. i dont like rap at all so thats what lost this cd a star, that and all the techno stuff. some of the new tracks are like phone calls that some of the special guests made or something like that. kind of pointless and i dont think they really needed to be on the cd. i liked some of the remixed versions better but not very many. so in conclusion, not bad if you already have the original, to hear some of the new things they did to the songs but get hybrid theory before you get this one.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|The good news is that the Cardinals are finest sounding band Ryan Adams ever played in. The best moments on \\"Cold Roses\\" is when Ryan is \\"just another band member\\", (not a front man)and shares guitar work, vocals, and songwriting with the Cardinals. Ryan Adams has finally assembled a band of players that are his own musical equals. The communal sound of the Cardinals not only anchors Adams as a soloist, but the Cardinals aspire to the same sacred  ground as first generation country rockers like the Byrds,the Flying Buritto Brothers and Buffalo Springfield.<br /><br />Cardinal member Cindy Cashdollar is an alumnus of the C&W swing band, Asleep at the Wheel. Ms. Cashdollar is first rate steel lap guitar, pedal steel and dobro player, whose first solo album \\"Slide Show\\" (2004) won  a great deal of critical praise. Her inventive and melodic slide playing make even the most ordinary of song take flight and soar.<br /><br />J.P Bowersock, who plays guitar in the Cardinals, is a cult figure on the New York City scene. He became guitar tutor to Strokes guitarist, Albert Hammond Jr. who said \\"`JP helped me discover what it was that I wanted to discover about music, things like how to discover empty spaces. It wasn't this strict teacher thing. I'd go to J.P.s have an hour's lesson and then hang out for a couple of hours, talk about music and drink beer.\\" In succession, J.P. also tutored Strokes guitarist Nick Valensi and vocalist Julian Casablancas. The unassuming Bowerstock was named official \\"guru\\" of the Strokes because of his involvement in the formation of the signature guitar sound of the Strokes.<br /><br />Ryan Adams holds Bowersock's guitar playing in similar esteem and introduces J.P. as \\"his hero and teacher\\" at live shows. It's a rare moment of humility for Adams whose swaggering attitude and bravado have often made Ryan, his own worst enemy. The quality of  Adams' songwriting has vastly improved and \\"Cold Roses\\" is at once, Ryan's most completely personal and metaphysical statement.<br /><br />Perhaps some of the Ram Dass philosophy that Ryan Adams reads is finally sinking in. The album contains themes of \\"terra firma\\" the idea of man's bonds to the earth and Mother Nature. There are numerous references to birds, mountains, plateaus, water, sky and life affirming flowers like rosebuds and magnolias.<br /><br />At an April concert at Higher Ground in Burlington Vermont I saw Adams' relaxed, elegant manner and personal approach, as he graciously addressed his fans in a most casual, heartfelt, respectful and appreciative mode. Adams' fellow Cardinals, likewise, are all down-to-earth and unassuming musicians. It's a striking contrast to Ryan's rude boy rock-star persona he affected for his \\"Heartbreaker\\" tour.<br /><br />Now the bad news... As magnificent as \\"Cold Roses\\" is, Ryan makes his usual mistake of thinking even his outtakes are interesting. A couple of the slow tracks where Ryan sings in that grating falsetto send me searching for my remote to skip the tunes.<br /><br />\\"Cold Roses\\" should have been a single album of 12 or 13 songs, not a double album of 18 songs. Sometimes less is better. He doesn't seem to know when to wrap the session and call it an \\"album\\". When you hear songs like \\"Magnolia Mountain\\", and \\"Easy Plateau\\" which are striking compositions, it makes it even harder to sit through the 4 or 5 weepy and self indulgent tunes that are included in \\"Cold Roses\\".<br /><br />While \\"Cold Roses\\" doesn't top the Flying Burrito Brothers \\"Gilded Palace of Sin\\" or the Band's self titled second album, it comes pretty close. The good news is that Ryan Adams and the Cardinals have two more albums to make on the Lost Highway label and it's Ryan Adams' best shot at making the musical masterpiece that's eluded him over the past ten years.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, \\"Cold Roses\\" delivers the goods and is one of the 2005's noteworthy albums. Its unfortunate Ryan Adams has been cursed with the burden of high expectations and Ryan's fans from the \\"Whiskytown\\" era seem to agree: \\"Cold Roses\\" is, but a glimpse at Ryan's musical potential. If he stays healthy and happy, Ryan Adams may well become the musical icon he's always aspired to be.Roses\\" is, but a glimpse at Ryan's musical potential. If he stays healthy and happy, Ryan Adams may well become the musical icon he's always aspired to be.
B000002H97|5.0|this is not my favorite metallica cd. all the songs are very good but this is the cd that began the change of metallica. this is probably my least listened to metallica cd. thats only because that most of the songs on this cd are played so much on the radio that its kind of gotten old but if you are a new metallica fan you really need to pick this one up. its their most popular one and im pretty sure that its got the most singles. some of my favorite songs would be enter sandman (the first song i completly learned to play on my guitar) sad but true, the unforgiven, wherever i may roam, the god that failed    ps i know what \\"sell out\\" means but really, isnt that what a band wants to do? sell their cds to make a living? i know what people mean when they say that but just think about it for a minute. this cd was great and was created by a great band, thats why it sold.
B000002542|5.0|I lived in northern Ca. (Saratoga) growing up as a kid and we would go up to SF and see Journey & Montrose before there first albums were even out on rainy fall week day nights at the greatest venue ever \\"WINTERLAND\\"...God Bless Bill Grahm!! The first three Journey albums (CD's) take me back to that magical time when music was great and knowing how to play your insrument meant something. Neal Schon was a guitar god and I learned ever one of the solos on these early tracks and the memory of those heady day's are almost too much when I go back a hear these songs...great memeories if you lived in the prime 70's but still exellent music to listen to if you never heard these songs before....but you know who you are if you were a teenager coming of age in the 70's with music like this blasting to the back drop of your life....Ahh Memeories....
B000002HMH|5.0|this is a big change from metallica's earlier stuff but that really doesnt mean its all that bad. its slower but heavier than reload. the one song that i think people dont like this cd is mama said. its sounds very country but its a really emotional song and very personal to james. but that is not at all what any of the other songs sound like. bleeding me is a slow song at first but then explodes. outlaw torn is more country than the rest but also gets a lot heavier towards the end.   favorites: i like all the songs pretty equally so....  least favorites: mama said, poor twisted me
B0006L16N8|5.0|I just got back from an hour long drive of listening to this whole album. Right away, I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck starting to stand on end. The whole album is very enlightening and brings a smile to your face at parts. The songs are a little bit different then the ones on \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". They don' t lack any emotion or feeling though.  <br />Buy this album!! It's amazing.
B000002HRE|4.0|ok so metallica's sound changed. its not as fast, its not as heavy but if they kept putting out master of puppets or ride the lightnings then people would start complaining about how they are too repetitive. i like the early works better but i dont like all the crap these guys are getting for trying something new. the same goes for load. i think the lyrics and the singing are pretty good accually. just because its not as heavy as some of their other cds doesnt mean its not as good. you just have to stop comparing it to other cds, give it a chance and give these guys some credit for what their trying to do. <br />favorites: fuel, prince charming, attitude, carpe diem baby, unforgiven II
0446614459|1.0|This is about as stupid a book as you will ever come across. I love to flay a few of my least favorite authors like James Patterson or Dean Koontz every chance I get. These guys do say a few original things every once and a while. Their ideas are sometimes interesting. It's just that these authors have a tendency to end every single novel with a happy and predictable ending that destroys credibility on their parts. I think they do this because their novels sell big time and they are not writing fiction so much as selling a product. Baldacci however is even worse at writing than Koontz or Patterson. Baldacci is from what I have encountered contemporary Americas worst best-selling writer by a long shot. He should not have the audience that he does, and it is a real mystery to me why this trash is so popular.<br /><br />The story starts off with two very unsympathetic characters attempting to come to grips with disasters that they were responsible for on the presidential campaign trail. They work together to find out just what really did happen several years ago when an obnoxious candidate was gunned down in their presence. The story never really takes off and mires itself in stupid conversation and inept problem solving. The characters are as flat and unresolved as can be. And the writing style is sophomoric at best. But above all of this is the ending. The way the mystery resolves itself is out and out laughable.<br /><br />Don't pick up this book, it is very bad and I am sure you will regret it. Try Denis Lehane or Patricia Cornwell instead.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|A movie based on personal growth and love.  Great acting by all those involved and has a great storyline that with make everyone fall in love with the movie.  A must see for everyone.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This cd is effing amazing. For any one who has listened to their first two cds (sounding the seventh trumpet and waking the fallen) then you know that they do not make the same cd twice, and city of evil is no different. For the most part they have ditched the emo/screamo in favour of a more old thrash/classic metal sound. And they have also pretty much gotten rid of all screaming vocals. So even if you didn't like their first two cds, you might like this. But everyone will be happy to know that they still play kick ass solos in alot of the songs. Pretty much every song kicks ass, and there is no real weak spot, so this cd will not disapoint. <BR>ps. A7X is the best band ever.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Unfortunately, they killed off the two most interesting characters in the whole saga: Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul. Ray Park simply oozed evil in his portrayal of Darth Maul, making him one of the most memorable movie villains of all time. He far surpassed Emperor Palpatine in his portrayal of hatred. In addition, he showed us why the Jedi so feared the Sith. He is skilled and deadly. Qui-Gon is masterfully played by Liam Neeson, in my estimation, one of the best actors in the world today. You can alost see the lines of power as he reaches out to The Force with his feelings. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this movie also suffers from some unforgivable sins. First and foremost, Jake Lloyd (as Annakin Skywalker) couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. He is truly awful. Natalie Portman has certainly acted better, as well. Her performance seems uninspired and forced. Yoda looked terrible, and overall, the movie seemed lackluster, almost as if it were made for the sole purpose of bringing the Star Wars franchise back into the spotlight at the expense of good film making. <br /> <br />Disappointing, but a necessary buildup to the eventual fall of Annakin Skywalker to The Dark Side, and his recreation as Darth Vader.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Let's make an obvious statement for anyone who has read the previous biased critiscism: This is no Waking the Fallen II.    And it's unfortunate that these reviews are laced with such preconceptions. If you're narrow-minded like some previous \\"reviewers\\" and expecting the band to write, and re-write \\"Darkness Surrounding\\" over and over again, you will be greatly dissapointed.  An excerise in repitition this is not.     As most have come to realize, \\"City of Evil\\" is asbent of screaming. This seems to be both a curse and a cure for the band's sound.  On the one hand, they seem to overcompensate for this by generally improving the musicianship (no doubt to carry on the metal torch).  Most notably: the drumming is a lot more flashy (along the lines of \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\") and the double bass seems to have more punch to it as opposed to the thin-paper sounding hits of more reckless bands. The bridge between Gates and Vengance labels as rhythm or lead roles has been nearly broken as both display nearly the same amount of ability on six strings.  The downside being that many parts within \\"City of Evil\\" are hit-or-miss ranging from truelly amazing to...as much as I hate to say...cheesy and overproduced. It's worth mentioning that it's become apparantly par for the course for irrational people to blame MAJOR LABEL's (in this case Warner's)interests as the reason why a band changes anything at all. It's pathetic how many people on here go around crying about how it's some Suit barging in the studio and supervising and reviewing all master tapes.  Get over it, the 80's have made you all paranoid. Take some time to realize that just MAYBE a band on the brink of a MAJOR LABEL DEBUT might want to revaluate for fear of sounding rehashed. It's called PROGRESS, what music should always be part of.    The solos are abundant, albiet at the expense of less empahsized lead lines. With perhaps the biggest differentiating factor between City of Evil and previous efforts beingthat without the screaming, the transistion from consistent sections to breakdown seem less apparant. This gives the album notions of more traditional tried-and-true efforts of bands like Iron Maiden and makes the cd feel as though it's moving at a much faster, though not neccasarily harder, pace.     Don't get me wrong. There are truly great moments on this CD.  It's an album that takes an open mind free of preconceptions and multiple listens. Not liking this cd is fine, it's not easy for band to please everyone along with themselves each time through. With all three cd's (and EP) lined up in chronological order it's easy to see progress, and that, in the end is what this cd should be judged on. Don't hate it becuase it refuses to copy itself, but at least respect that through such a hectic time in the band's history, they still didn't rest on there laurels. Despite what cynical, holier than thou, reviews have said: A7X's career is just beginning so hopefully the band will pick up on things from each release and make a truelly astounding career highlight next round.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I picked this CD up and Deadwing by porcupine tree on the same day- Im in prog heaven!!! This is a GREAT CD! I cant give it 5- because thats what I feel  Scenes, and Images and Words deserve. GREAT ALBUM!!! PROG ON!!!
B0006L16N8|4.0|I should preface my review by saying that I am a Coldplay fan in the truest sense of the word.  I've been eagerly awaiting the release of what became X&Y ever since I saw Coldplay live in St. Louis over two years ago.  Weeks before the album was officially released in the US (today), I listened to streams of \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Talk\\" and more recently, to the full album stream via MTV.com so many times my roommates wanted to kill me.  Thus, I'm very familiar with X&Y already.  At first, the novelty of \\"new\\" Coldplay led me to believe that Chris Martin and crew had in fact achieved their goal of creating the \\"best album ever.\\"  Now, as some time has passed and the novelty has worn off, I can be more objective and say that X&Y is a great album, albeit maybe not their best.  X&Y is louder than Parachutes, yet less \\"rocky\\" than Rush of Blood to the Head.  I for one prefer Rush of Blood to the Head to X&Y and X&Y to Parachutes.  However, it's tough to compare albums, as is popular on this website, because they really are three different albums ... and yet all Coldplay albums at the same time (thankfully).  In a nutshell, the lyrics are amazing (thank you Chris Martin).  The supporting cast successfully masters both the crescendo and decrescendo, performing both \\"loud\\" and \\"quiet\\" songs with ease.  The album flows incredibly well from song to song, although it may not have as many standout singles as Rush of Blood to the Head.  \\"Fix You\\" is one of the best Coldplay songs ever and may very well win song of the year at the Grammy's.  My other personal favorites are What If, X&Y, The Hardest Part, Swallowed in the Sea, and 'Til Kingdom Come, although it's tough to go wrong with any of the songs (except for Twisted Logic, which Chris Martin describes as his angry song ... maybe they should stay away from angry from now on).  If you're a Coldplay fan already, you'll love X&Y.  And if you're not, buy the record anyways, because I think it'll change your mind.  Just don't getTOO caught up in all the media hype over X&Y, because then you'll inevitably feel somewhat disappointed.  The one assurance is that as good as X&Y is, Coldplay will keep striving to write the \\"greatest album ever\\".  I for one think that it's well within their reach.
B0007XT87G|5.0|All I NEED TO SAY- PROG ALBUM OF THE YEAR- OF THE DECADE? DEADWING!!!!!
B0009QTS1M|4.0|This is advertised as an \\"extended edition\\", but your technical information does not mention the length of this \\"extended\\" edition as other listings do.  Is it an extended edition because it's loaded with extras, like commentaries etc? Or are there deleted scenes included in the movie itself.  If you're going to advertise an \\"Extended\\" edition you should at least explain what the extensions are!  I want to buy this movie but not until I see further explanation.  I'm sure many of your other customers feel the same way.  Your marketing people should be more on the ball.  You're losing a lot of sales due to their lack of expertise.
B000069AUI|2.0|This album in no way can match up to the brilliance of Parachutes.  It's just boring drivel.  Parachutes was ten times more upbeat and faster and had the emotion that this album lacked.  Only a select few songs were good on this album such as clocks and in my place.  If you want to try out coldplay buy parachutes and you will fall in love.  This album was cheaply put together in 2 years unlike Parachutes which took a lifetime to create and is filled with much more emotion.
B00005JNVS|5.0|I am definitely not a fan of the usual kung fu movies, and I went into this movie as a favor for a friend, thinking to myself, \\"This is going to suck.\\" I had not seen a trailer for it, so I didn't know what to expect at all. About five minutes into the movie, I started laughing and did not stop until I went to sleep that night! It was absolutely hilarious!!  <br /> <br />Not only was the plot easy to follow though complex enough to be ironic, the f/x used were perfect for the characters and plot, adding a dimension to a movie that, under anyone else's direction, could have been a huge disaster. I was impressed with the many running themes; physical ability vs. mental power, right vs. wrong, fate, power struggle. The english subtitles were easy to read, essentially allowing the viewer to place the setting, and also creating more believable characters. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie to anyone who favors wit, to anyone who likes Matrix-esque f/x, or to anyone who really doesn't think they will like this movie at all. Keep an open mind and you will not be disappointed.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I give these guys partial credit for trying to please people and for not being at all like all of the crappy music out there today. This CD isn't a bleed to the ears, but it also isn't something I can sit and listen to and love. This band made some good stuff back in the day, but this is just good music made by them in the direction that I didn't want them to go in. <br /> <br />Well, this CD actually is not as good as Dream Theater's best at all. They can do a lot better than what you hear on this album. The title track is pretty good, but SLIGHTLY too long.
0316779237|4.0|Holidays on Ice: Stories was my first exposure to David Sedaris, and this collection of 6 holiday essays is the funniest book, ever.  With Sedaris, nothing is sacred about the holidays.  He lampoons working at Macy's as a Christmas elf, holiday newsletters, school pageants, and excessive gift giving.  Some of his humor is side-splitting, tears rolling down your cheeks funny.  SantaLand Dairies, about Sedaris working at Macy's in SantaLand is the funniest and the longest story of the bunch.  How Sedaris kept himself sane while parading around as an elf will have you laughing out loud.<br /><br />Other stories are written with a deeper, darker, more satirical wit.  One story, Seasons Greetings to Our Friends and Family, was a little too morbid for my taste.  But all the stories are good, and all of them make us realize how over-the-top our Christmas celebrations have become.<br /><br />I listened to this book on CD, which made it even more enjoyable as it's read by the author.  Simply reading the book will cheat you out of hearing Sedaris mimic Billie Holiday singing Away In A Manger.<br /><br />So in addition to the three or four other Christmas \\"classics\\" that I enjoy reading each year, I now have a new one to add to my list.
B0006L16N8|5.0|X&Y is one of those rare recordings where every track is an enjoyable experience.  Usually if an album has 3 or 4 great tracks it's good in my book.  Here you get 13 unbelievable tracks.  Now, if you were expecting this to be like Coldplay's previous recordings, Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head, you may be at first a little dissapointed but like those other records this one as well gets more amazing with each listen. Coldplay's albums grow and grow on you.  There are beautiful choruses and melodies throughout this most wonderful album.  Coldplay has grown on this recording, songs like Twisted Logic,X&Y, and White Shadows bare witness to that. This album is as other reviews have said simply sublime and is Coldplay's best work to date.       Here's a recent amendment by myself:  I already reviewed this album raving about it and this still holds. This is for all of those 1,2,and 3 star reviwers. You need to stop with this. Anybody reading this that likes Coldplay will ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS ALBUM. TRUST ME!! And for everyone that wants this album to sound like a carbon copy of their first two albums, here's a little tidbit for you. In a recent interview their guitarist Jonny Buckland said in relation to their music quote, \\"If ever we fall back on our own tricks or things we've done before, it becomes boring.\\" Coldplay have moved on and evolved, yet still kept their signature beauty, grace and glorious melodies and choruses. They don't want to keep producing the same albums, they want to experiment. You would have to hate music do dislike this most worthy album. Glorious, dark, layered, rich, harmonic, thick, sonic greatness awaits you on this album. Won't you do the honor??
B0007TKNL0|4.0|This movie is loaded with stunning performances, but none bigger then Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson. However, this movie had to deal with a lot of doubting critics like most plays turned into movies. Because in the past 35 years, there have only been 3 successful box-office musicals, and that was Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita and Chicago. I think Phantom Of The Opera is really good, remains loyal and with the help of stunning direction by Joel Schumacher it is made a classic movie. I think it surpasses Evita. And it also marks Andrew Lloyd Webber's 3rd musical adaption which also includes Evita and of course the classic Jesus Christ Superstar. I think Phantom Of The Opera can join them both as a movie classic, anyone who likes the play will love this movie. I was impressed by Emmy Rossom's performance, 16 years old during filming and she steals the show with her magnificent voice. Gerard Butler plays a wonderful Phantom and does well on bringing that character to life. Patrick Wilson can't be left out, his wonderful voice also makes his character worth watching in the film. Again, if you like the play, you will love this movie. Buying the dvd is worth every penny, believe me.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I like the sound of this c.d.  Why? Well because plain and simple it is the Coldplay sound.  there's nothing really new here, BUT, it is still done well and will grow on you in time.  Obviously there's the two or three songs that you would have already heard on SNL or other late night shows, but I am sure that after listening to this cd a few times through it will be just as beloved as their first two.   <br /> <br />I do wish they had tried a little something different or new, but I guess we can't complain when they continue to do what they do and well at that. <br /> <br />4 stars for now, 5 in about a month.
B000021XS0|1.0|OMG, this album is so lame, this is not music, and this john petrucci guy thinks he's good at guitar? His stuff is so easy to play, he's not even that fast, his legato playing sucks, along with what most people call complex use of modes and his scale runs.  This guy is a hack, just because he supposedly scored off the charts at berkelee (which is higher than a ten) people think he's god at guitar. listen to simple plan for good music and virtuoso guitar playing. nuff said.
B0000VCZKW|3.0|To \\"BOYCOTT THIS DISC!!!\\" I'm stunned to see that this Special Edition is in fullscreen and I fell with Scott. If you want a widescreen edition of \\"Matilda\\" real bad, then you can get it on Region 2. Fortunately, for me, I live in Denmark and have it ... and it is worth to have in widescreen cuz the pictures are well composed!
B00080ZG10|2.0|WhenI first saw the aviator,i was dissapointed.I thought most of the scences were way to long or extended and the movie would focus on one part then move to something else.(now,if you want a great time at the movies,and a great movie overall,see 'sin city.')The aviator had it's moments,but i am going to have to give this a thumbs down.
B0006L16N8|5.0|If I give this album an amazing review, do I get to do it with Guy Berryman? Hopefully. Anyway, this album is beautiful all the way through. I guess Chris Martin's ego is going to get even bigger. Then again, is that possible?
0767805712|4.0|This being a Hollywood film, I was expecting lots of \\"The Human Spirit(TM) always triumphs over Technology\\" soapbox cliches---which there was, but it was relatively subtle and well-integrated into the film.<br /><br />\\"Gattaca\\" works mainly due to the enormously appealing central characters, namely Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law, without whom it would've been just another made-for-cable B-movie.  The script, camera work, film editing and set design are also quite good, which kept this film moving along briskly.<br /><br />My main disappointment was that the plot resolution basically cops out and hinges upon the 'ole deux ex machina...however, the predictably happy ending is partially balanced out with the chosen fate of Jude Law's character which was a pretty gutsy move.<br /><br />I shudder to think just how a MILLION TIMES cornier this movie would've been in the hands of a Steven Spielberg...o the horror!
B0009I7NNA|1.0|This highly anticiapted album finally reaches us in what potentially could be the breaking or making of hunky (except for the lead singer) Avenged seven. With their prior albums reaching out to the alienated and disaffected youth (or elders like myself) many awaited this album eagerly with bated breath. Their last album was a symphonic epic which drew comparisons with the likes of metal heros such as Kelly Osbourne and Van Halen. It was an intimate album for me personally in helping me triumph over the wanton evil that is my mother (see previous review). But I felt that it was let down by the distinct lack of handsomeness on behalf of the lead singer (smelly shadows or something) which made that album utterly meaningless. <br />However upon hearing in the national enquirer that lipsocution and plastic sugery were going to be used on him to make him georgous  I once again declared myself to the cause of angst and aligned myself once again with the troubadors of the hurting. IN fact I have spent the last two months of my life stalking these chaps as they worked on the final mixes of \\"City of Evil\\". That persistent banging sound heard on \\"Strength of the World\\" is in fact me screaming marriage proposals at the band while hammering on the door of the studio. I was dismayed to find I had not received any recognition on the album credits and will be issuing a countersuit pretty soon. The suit that the band has filed againsy myself is nothing  but a tangle of lies which alleges that I had ruined the lives of their families and loved ones. I in fact have done nothing of the sort, I was merely telling them to keep the hell away from my band. <br />Back to the album anyway. I felt that this album suffered from trying to break free from our musical heritage, most notably that cornerstone of Western Music, Gary Barlow's Open Road which can be percieved as  a continuation of the great romantic link which begun with Beethoven and ended with Simon Le Bons musings. I have no problem with musical progress, but I do have a problem with this albym in that it not only rejects counterpoint melodies as a device (the way forward in my eyes) but also ignores any sense of rythmic harmony which is absolute heresy. Does \\"City of Evil\\" refer to the fact that the band are a Godless entity by rejecting the musical progression of masters such as James Brown, Gary Glitter, Barlow and Schoenberg. <br /> <br />Now for my objective review at last. A lot of the album is linked thematically about their recent experiences especially the self loathing of the lead singer. References to plastic surgery are numerous throughout especially in the caustic deconstructive \\"Burn It Down, the harrowing 'Blinded in chains and the heartbreaking 'Betrayed'. These are the shining moments of smelly shadows which is a clear indication that he is compulsively obsessed about his appearance. This sickens me as it your soul that ultimately counts, not what you look like. Lowlights include the uninspiring 'Seize the day'' which sounds like it was written and sung by a dying whale. The guitar-led upbeat \\"Wicked End\\" is particularly apt as the band are destined to finish up in this manner. In fact the finest moment of the album is that pounding noise in \\"strength of the world. Unlucky Gaz, not enough to save this sloppy album. I dont know whether it was the influence of that evil minx yoko ono enigma that is Amanda A7X with her obsession about the lead singer trying to pry him away from the rest of the band into her foul crutches. See you in court boys, I hope I get close enough to one of you boys to hit you with my zimmerframe. Overall this album has the emotional impact of a hot air balloon hitting a mountain. <br /> <br />
B0009I7NNA|3.0|People reviewing this beat me to it.  The band messed up. bad.  Who told the singer that he could actually sing.  He must understand that his voice only sounded good in CONTRAST to the damn screaming, and of, course, he no longer screams.  Other reviewers have already said it.  Wait for the next album, hope they get this message.  I loved their other two albums but I can't imagine anyone liking this.
0439679958|5.0|To be honest, I picked up this book by accident. Presuming it was another of Horowitz's addicting Alex Rider series, I had taken it off of the shelf and found it in among my purchase bag as a total surprise. However, this did not stop me from reading this book first out of the many that I usually attain.<br /><br />As an avid reader at age 14, I believe this book to be one of the best summer reads so far. This book takes you into a world where almost anything can happen, not unlike Harry Potter books. It is quick paced and encapturing, a lot like the Alex Rider series by the same author. Add a little other-worldy ancient evil into the mix, much like the Midnighter's series by Scott Westerfield, and you've got an instant wonder-book!<br /><br />In this main tale, long-since orphaned Matt is given unequified punishment for crimes he only partially committed. Stuck to deal with a crazy new guardian in an even stanger new small town of the English countryside, he begins to realize that  fate has its hand upon him. He finds evidence to believe that his new legal advisor- even the whole town- may have planned the whole thing, even back to the death of his parents!<br /><br />Struggling with help of the few persons who reach out to him, Matt begins to realize he must fufill more than ever expected of a 14 year old before. An ancient prophecy remains to be proven at his hands. It is up to Matt to stop an ancient evil from rising into the world, against all odds.<br /><br />I absolutely ADORED this book, and I could not have been more pleased to have 'accidentally' chosen it off of the book store shelf. This book discusses pre-ordained fate throughout witty plot and character developement. Fate, however, most definitely came into my hands in the form of reading this book. Absolutely excellent and I cannot wait for the entirety of the series to become available!
B0006L16N8|4.0|I consider ROBTTH their best album. Parachutes was great to...probably better than X&Y, but in any case ROBTTH is _definitely_ better than X&Y. This is a good album, but just not a great one. If you're looking for a song as good as amsterdam, clocks, or in my place, this album won't have it. <br /> <br />So, if you're a coldplay fan do buy this album and you'll like it, but don't expect a ground breaking album.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I just wanted to correct a statement made by \\"Marty from SF\\" regarding the DVD. Don Felder is NOT in the show, and has not been a member of the Eagles for the last few years. With that said, I saw two shows from this tour live in New Jersey, and watched the TV broadcast on NBC. While I realize I may be premature in giving a grade to a DVD that hasn't been released yet, If the disc is anywhere near close to representing what I have already seen, 5 stars is a must.
B0006L16N8|4.0|After I listened from Square One to Til Kingdom Come, first thing that came to my mind was that this cd doesn't sound anything like Parachutes or Rush of Blood to the Head.  I liked it though. I don't necessarily think it's better than Rush of Blood nor as good. Out of all the songs from the three Coldplay cd's, I think the weakest lay in X&Y. But, this just shows how amazing Coldplay is: There are only 2 or 3 weak songs on X&Y, a few good ones, and a few amazing ones.  IMO the best cd's in order are   A Rush of Blood To The Head  Parachutes (Close second)  X&Y  (really close third)    Highlights:    Square One  What If  Fix You  X&Y  Speed Of Sound  A Message  Swallowed In The Sea  Twisted Logic  Til Kingdom Come
B00097DX3U|4.0|I kind of tuned out of the metal scene at around the time bands like Nirvana and Soundgarden killed off the Cinderella's and Ratt's of the world. I just didn't care for the whole \\"grunge\\" scene or sound. I have never cared for rap or hip-hop, especially if it was blended with metal, so the whole Rage Against the Machine and P.O.D. scene was well below my radar. So I was pretty surprised when I picked up the debut album of Audioslave after hearing their tune Cochise on the radio. I really liked the first album and was shocked to learn that the band was actually made up of musicians from two elements of the metal scene I had written off. With Out of Exile, Audioslave gives us one of the best CD's of the year. Audioslave has taken a great bluesy-metal approach this time around that really works. The great thing about this disk is the variety of music presented here, from the kickin' title track, to the power balled \\"Be Yourself\\", to \\"The Worm\\" which has one of the best guitar riffs I have heard in years, you cannot wait to hear where the band will take you next. I would love to see some of these tunes performed live. This is just a great album, and I really hope Audioslave continues to produce music that is this exciting and fresh for years to come. I might just have to become a metal head again.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I love this cd. I have been a coldplay fan since their second album was released. I have bought all their albums which are Coldplay Live 2003, Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head. All of them are outstanding in their own way! They are all for the most part have different sounds but are still outstanding! My favorite tracks on this album are Fix You, Speed of Sound, Low, A Message and What If. If you are not a coldplay fan become one, because they are an outstanding band that are down to earth and write songs because that is what they love to do. Amazing Lyrics and Melodies! I strongly applaud them for every one of their albums. If you don't have it yet, buy it! You definitely will enjoy it! Just pop it in your stereo and just listen to this amazing band! You will be glad that you did! You will never want to turn it off!
B0006L16N8|1.0|X - Avoid the necessity to X this out of your collection later on by not purchasing it.   <br /> <br />Y - Yawn yourself into torpidity if the above warning is not considered.     <br /> <br />This album is a total unmemorable wash of boredom.  NOTHING stays with you!  The die hards will all say how fantastic X&Y is because they can't bear to think this band might release something horrible.  How could they?  They seemed to be on top of the world with an endless stash of great hooks and melodies.  Well, the stash has run out.  I don't blame anybody for being curious since \\"Rush Of Blood...\\" was so good, but this doesn't measure up at all!   <br /> <br />Somebody was squawking about Grammys but we all know what a wash that is.  Artistic quality was never figured into Grammy nominations and never will be.  X&Y will win Grammys because it was shipped in millions of units not because the music is timeless.  <br /> <br />AVOID!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Since 1994, Dream Theater has followed an uncanny pattern in album excellence.  \\"Awake\\" was unbelievable - \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" was pretty good - \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" is the best album of all time - \\"Six Degrees ...\\" has its creative merits - \\"Train of Thought\\" is an unstoppable beast.  So, by this logic, their next album will be good, but not a towering sonic monolith.<br /><br />So, is this a self-fulfilling prophecy?  It's hard to tell.<br /><br />\\"Octavarium\\", Dream Theater's ninth studio album, is definitely a change in direction from \\"Train of Thought\\", which was a guitar-heavy album.  Dream Theater's newest release is an atmospheric composition that focuses more on symphonic keyboard textures than it does on meaty guitar riffs.  This particular ambience (along with the addition of a symphony) has taken over the spotlight, making each song more structured, accessible and consistently catchy, which was not the case with their last release.  Petrucci and Rudess' virtuoso deliveries (more commonly known as \\"shredding\\") are kept down to an absolute minimum on this album.  One may suppose that the band realized that the songs on \\"Train of Thought\\" were following a decipherable pattern: intro, verse, chorus, long instrumental fireworks, chorus, finish.<br /><br />So what do we have, exactly?  We have an album that explores various areas of the progressive world.  We have \\"The Root of All Evil\\", a continuation of Portnoy's multi-album suite (beginning with \\"The Glass Prison\\" and continued by \\"This Dying Soul\\"), which starts the album on a relatively heavy note.  In it's 8-minute run, it re-visits riffs, rhythms and even lyrics from its predecessors (namely \\"I can feel my body breaking - shaking\\") and a shaky, unimpressive chorus that borrows from James LaBrie's forgettable experience with Tim Donahue.  \\"Panic Attack\\" is a look back to Liquid Tension Experiment's rapid fire guitar riffs and blitzkrieg drums, never slowing down in its spectacular 8-minute duration.  It is the fastest Dream Theater song to date and an explosive standout track.<br /><br />Aside from those songs, the rest of the album is considerably slower and softer than anything we have heard from Dream Theater since the collection of ballads found on 1997's \\"Falling into Infinity\\".  The serene \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" begins with the sounds of crickets and a lonely piano, leading into a soothing song where Rudess' delicate melodies journey alongside a quiet troupe of strings, which have a brief \\"solo\\" where Petrucci would normally show off.  The song is very (and I mean *very*) reminiscent of \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" in its folksy, feel-good song construction and melodies.  But it is nowhere near as poppy or infectious as the upbeat, radio-ready \\"I Walk Beside You\\", which is the closest Dream Theater has come to sounding like Hoobastank or the Goo Goo Dolls.  It's still a great song, despite the predictable and sugarcoated rock riffs.<br /><br />Speaking of predictability, Dream Theater have yet another politically interested song, following in the footsteps of 2001's \\"The Great Debate\\" and 2003's \\"In the Name of God\\".  In fact, this album's 10-minute \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is, most accurately described, \\"In the Name of God Part 2\\" with the same lyrical theme (religious fanaticism) and similar threatening atmospheres as its predecessor.<br /><br />Then there's the surprise.  The 24-minute prog-rock title track.  I didn't know what to make of \\"Octavarium\\" at first as it was a complete surprise.  It is a total departure from \\"A Change of Seasons\\" (the band's other 20+ minute epic).  It seems that Portnoy's prog-rock experiences with Transatlantic have leaked out into Dream Theater.  The metal is gone, replaced by a softer rock that sounds a lot like IQ and Spock's Beard with synchronized guitars and keyboards, and a myriad of different sounds (like juxtaposing a solitary acoustic guitar for a few seconds and stomping on it with a catchy prog melody).  After the first painfully long four minutes, the guitars kick in, paving the way for a truly memorable experience, headlined by acoustic guitars, soothing vocals, lots of piano, a curious flute (a surprise) and later a full symphony (a shock).<br /><br />The symphony is difficult to digest.  Dream Theater have always proved to be masters of their craft by working wonders with their instruments - and their instruments only.  Now we have a symphony adding a supporting fill to their already organic songs.  Fortunately, it isn't ubiquitous (&agrave; la Nightwish's \\"Once\\") or thinly spread out (&agrave; la Pain of Salvation's \\"BE\\").  Instead, it's prominent and heavy at select times like an active volcano.  The strings punch out in short bursts at the majestic end of \\"These Walls\\", subtly guide the keyboards of \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" and, with the help of some horns, bring \\"Octavarium\\" to a stunning finish.<br /><br />Every song on the album is unique one way or another (except \\"Never Enough\\", which doesn't take off until its instrumental delivery 2/3 of the way into the song) and form the parts of yet another great Dream Theater release.  Although the album may not survive the test of time like \\"Images and Words\\" or \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" have, it is still a delightful listen and an impressive creative output.<br /><br />Sure, they *are* my all-time favorite band, so my standards are extremely high.  Despite the surprises and occasionally awkward moments, \\"Octavarium\\" passes my intense scrutiny.<br /><br />See also: Dream Theater - \\"Falling into Infinity\\", Dream Theater - \\"Images and Words\\", Transatlantic - \\"SMPT:e\\", Spock's Beard - \\"V\\"kick in, paving the way for a truly memorable experience, headlined by acoustic guitars, soothing vocals, lots of piano, a curious flute (a surprise) and later a full symphony (a shock).

B00003CX5P|4.0|I admit, I've been a little late to the STAR WARS party. Sure, in the past I had caught the famous original trilogy, but the whole STAR WARS phenomenon didn't compel me enough to check out this film and EPISODE II in theaters. Now that EPISODE III has come out (and, of course, made big bucks at the box office), though, I figure I owed it to myself not only to revisit the original trilogy, but finally sit down and watch the newer films as well.    So I'm in the process, and today I finally got to THE PHANTOM MENACE, which was released in 1999 amidst eager anticipation and hype and so-so reviews from the critics.    It's not quite as bad as many critics said. Sure, George Lucas' plot---something to do with violent conflict regarding trade routes---is rather incoherent and near-incomprehensible, but I was certainly not bored by it. The myriad visual sights Lucas (digitally) creates for the film, and some of the action scenes and special effects, are often so awesome to look at that the film often compels in spite of its serious flaws.    Still, I'm not a moviegoer who is seduced merely by visual allure and interesting technological trickery (as important as it can be in film, which is a visual medium, above all), so for me storytelling this sloppy, dialogue this stiff, and acting this wooden is pretty hard to ignore. Lucas is lucky to have an old pro like Liam Neeson to play Qui-Gon Jinn; Neeson may not be the most electrifying actor in the world---and he certainly isn't under Lucas' careless direction---but he can almost always be counted on to at least emanate a sense of authority in his performances, and he accomplishes that task once again here, even among Lucas' cheesy dialogue. Jake Lloyd, the cute young boy who plays Anakin Skywalker in this film, is unfortunately not so lucky. To my surprise, I didn't find him quite as awful as many others have made the kid out to be; clearly, Lucas cast him for his innocent look, as perhaps a stab at irony---this cute kid is gonna turn into Darth Vader someday? Impossible! Lloyd has his moments---he's genuinely touching when saying goodbye to his ever-concerned mother---but it's ultimately an extremely uneven performance. He may have one or two good scenes before he comes up with a line reading so unbelievably cutesy and amateurish I couldn't bear to blame it all on Lloyd; it had to be Lucas who was staring at a blue screen instead of focusing on his actors. The rest of the cast copes decently, I suppose, although Samuel L. Jackson, as Mace Windu, simply looks bored to me onscreen in the few scenes he has in this film (although, considering what he has to utter, I can't necessarily blame him).    As for the storytelling, I was never caught up in the whole trade-conflict thing. But then, is plot ever really the point of the STAR WARS movies? Lucas may throw in tidbits of plot here and there, but when those fight scenes roar to life, plot becomes secondary to sheer energy level. (It's basically good-versus-evil, a theme that's become so old that it barely qualifies as a serious artistic theme anymore.) Still, it's hard to watch the impressive pod-race scene in the middle of the film without realizing how arbitrary and pointless the scene is; Lucas uses Sebulba's resistance to Jedi mind tricks as an excuse to throw in a big, dumb, but technically impressive action setpiece. At least there was a real one-thing-after-another momentum in the original STAR WARS to keep viewers from asking too many questions about plot; Lucas' pacing here is not nearly as forward-moving, and so big questions inevitably pop up (especially with his lackluster attempt at a plot twist when it turns out that \\"handmaiden\\" Padme Amidala is actually the real Queen---so why the hell was everyone near her addressing the decoy Queen as if she was the real McCoy, anyway?).    Despite all its huge flaws, though, STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE has enough visual splendor and impressive special effects to make the filmdiverting, even if you're never really caught up in the plot or its characters. Perhaps this uneven film is merely a prelude to more deeply dramatic things to come in the next two movies (although I hear EPISODE II is a snooze). I shall persevere. For the time being, I recommend this film...barely.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|This cd has to be the most dissapointing for me so far this year.  After listening to waking the fallen religiously since it came out this cd is not even close to the same calibur of music. <br /> <br />I heard the first few songs on websites and immediately hated them.  I was hoping that the rest of the cd would be different, that is not the case.  Each song seems to get progressively worse and blends in with the next, not a single song sticks out as something I even want to hear again.  There are no beautiful ballads, in fact the one song that is an attempt at I Wont See You Tonight Part 1 (from Waking the Fallen) is the most pathetic sounding song on the cd.  There is no screaming in the songs which was a staple in Waking.  It makes all the songs sound watered down and completely uninteresting.  The lack of screaming is what I really hate about this cd as it sounds like an attempt on mainstream radio.  However, this attempt will not work because all of these songs sound horrible anyway. <br /> <br />Coming from someone that used to love A7X I must say do not buy this cd, wait to hear their next material.
0375422889|5.0|I was enthusiastic about reading this sequel to Persepolis because I enjoyed the first volume so much.  Satrapi uses a simple (but not simplistic) black and white style that is quite expressive as she tells the story of her life after returning to her home in post-Revolution Iran from schools in Europe.  The book details the difficulties she faced as a woman and as a citizen, and continues through her marriage.<br /><br />Enlightening and entertaining.  Highly recommended.
B00006L83N|5.0|This album is by far, hands down, the best pro-metal album ever to be released, and i could say that listening to just the title track, this album features one of the best vocalists, Russel Allen, and of coarse, my hero, on guitar, Michael Romeo. <br />I feel that if you like face melting metal this album delivers and is definetly a must buy weather your a fan of John Williams, or Slayer. and now the tracks, 1. Inferno (unleash the fire) - This song is a burner and very very fast, the vocals growl and this is definetly a pace setting riff for the whole album. 2. Wicked - This is definetly the heaviest song on the record. Starts out with a ballsy riff and very haunting keyboard lines, definetly a favorite. 3. Incantations of the Apprentice - This is definetly a vocal based song and oh man, is there vocals. Russel's voice in this one could tear down a brick wall and the guitar lines are genius, also, Jason Rullo's drums are insane on this track. 4. The Accolade II - This one starts out with very beutiful piano and violin melodies and is a very very well composed song, by far one of the best compositions on the album. 5. King of terrors - This one is Destruction. the song has a very hounting sound and very heavy guitars. 6. The Turning - one word, Insane. This song is very very fast and is very \\"shred\\". I play guitar and this is definetly one of the coolest riffs anywhere. 7. Awakenings - This song is one of the most moving and romantic (not a metal word haha) songs on the album. There is a big Vocal/Piano melodies and is very brilliant, but then Romeo kicks it up and throws very very fast and cool riffs in. Laso Michael Pinnela's Keyboard riffs are beyond amazing. 8. The Oddysey - imply put, THE GREATEST SONG EVER. 24 minuetes of genuis and the best compositions ever, Mozart and Bach would be proud. Everything about this song is great. They could have just put this song on the album and it would be a hit, definetly worth buying for just this song. 9. Masquarade '98 -this is a remake of the original from the first Symphony X record, and in this version the guitars are kicked through the roof.   GREAT ALBUM GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
037571457X|5.0|I was curious about this book because I wanted to know more about women's experiences in the Middle East.  I've read other graphic novels and compared to them the illustrations here are more stark but equally rewarding; Satrapi uses a simple (but not simplistic) black and white style that is quite expressive as she tells the story of life before, during and after the 1979 Revolution that changed life in Iran for so many people.<br /><br />Fearing for her safety, her parents send her to school in Europe, and the author does a wonderful job of articulating her maturation as an individual and as a citizen of a tumultuous country.  Persepolis 2 details her experiences when she returns to her homeland as a young woman.<br /><br />Enlightening and entertaining.
B0001L3MI0|1.0|In case I forget to mention it, Independence Day flat out stinks. <br />Very briefly, I agree with most of the other one-star reviews.  First, this picture is horribly mis-cast--Bill Pullman as the President and Robert Loggia as a general?  Ptooie!  Next, all trace of story logic is kicked aside so we can quickly move on to another \\"Awwwww\\", \\"Yee-Haw\\", or \\"Gobbless Amurrica\\" moment.  And last, the plot devices are so thin that I started having nightmare flashbacks of Sean Connery in Outland.    <br /> <br />Still, Will Smith is an amusing guy and the special effects are as good as advertised.  What's the harm in cranking suspension of disbelief up a few more notches and enjoying the ride?  This attitude carried me up to the point that the valiant US Air Force bravely attacked the scum-sucking aliens in defense of a grateful world.  These bold pilots closed with a target the size of downtown Los Angeles and let 'er have it with a devastating salvo of Sidewinders.  As if a bunch of air-to-air missiles with 20 pound warheads are going to affect a saucer covering the lower half of California!  To say nothing of why get close at all?  Are they afraid of missing?  I fled the room at that point and could only finish the movie after the brick-to-the-forehead feeling went away. <br /> <br />People got paid money to write this dreck.  I recommend you don't give them any more.  If you feel you must experience the special effects or Mr. Smith's comedy firsthand, borrow your friend's copy. <br /> <br />Finally, I'm amazed that there are five or six different \\"special\\" DVD editions of Independence Day.  No matter how many times you rub it, you can't polish a cow pie.
B0006L16N8|5.0|If I could give X&Y ten stars, I would. Across the board, these tracks have something special to them. They will surely grow on you, get stuck in your head, and beg you to read the poetry in their lyrics. Amazing!
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Okay, here's to the oh so politically correct:<br /><br />a) Yes, this was a tacky, tacky, movie but hey, it's a tacky world<br />b) Absolutely nothing(and I do mean NOTHING)is sacred<br /><br />Actually, since I knew beforehand this was from the makers of South Park, I had no preconceived notions in the least that a modicum of taste would be evident in the movie.<br /><br />I was right.<br /><br />The movie is so irreverent that at times you become embarrassed for<br />laughing at some very insensitive observations. I was prepared to<br />submit a review drenched in how appalled I was at the social<br />insensitivity.<br /><br />Then I saw the sequence involving puppet sex.<br /><br />I simply LOST it!!! The movie has excellent production standards and<br />visually is quite interesting. But, alas, I yield to the brashness of<br />the movie producers and join an amazing mass of people who found this<br />movie to be simply hysterical.<br /><br />And don't feel bad for laughing - this is from the creators of SOUTH<br />PARK, for godsakes!!!! Take the chain off ya brain, and laugh like hell!!!<br />Believe me, you will!!!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I actually watched this performance on our local public television station 3 times now, and I just can't get enough!<br /><br />Because of this, I recently decided to purchase the CD, and I listen to it quite often.<br /><br />The music included in \\"Celtic Woman\\" is wonderfully enchanting and beautiful - it actually feels as if the music is touching your soul!  There are really no words to adequately describe how listening to this music makes you feel...<br /><br />If you like celtic music, you'll love this CD!
0786890754|1.0|This was the most juvenile, trite, and poorly written novel of the (I hate to say it) \\"Chick Lit\\" genre I've ever read. This book was obviously published because of who's daughter the author is, not because she has any talent. I read the entire book hoping it was going to get better but it didn't. The plot is neither unique nor well thought out. Apparently the author felt she had to describe every little detail of every interaction her characters had, but when your characters are only one dimensional, the descriptions are overkill. I swore if Holly, Sharon, Denise, or anyone else for that matter \\"giggled\\" at something or someone again, I was going to throw the book out the window. Get a thesaurus!!! <br />This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Walk past this one even on the remainder table. Pick up a copy of \\"Good Grief\\" you'll be glad that you did.
B0006L16N8|5.0|The wait is over, X&Y has been released.  Although I've been listening to the album off of MTV non-stop, I'm so glad to finally have the album.  This album has been reviewed by many critics from around the world with summary judgements ranging from \\"nothing special\\" to \\"a masterpiece\\".   <br />My opinion- it's a great album.  I looooved A Rush of Blood to the Head, and this album seems a little more mainstream than the aforementioned.  But I love it nonetheless.   <br />Differences in this album: <br />The guitar is featured much more in X&Y than AROBTTH. <br />There is no Amsterdam-ish song (in my opinion). <br /> <br />My favorite songs: <br />White Shadows  <br />Square One <br />Fix You <br />A Message <br />Talk <br />Swallowed in the Sea <br />'Til Kingdom Come <br /> <br />Just buy it- it's a beautiful album.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Coldplay's objective was to try to create a completely different album than the last one. This one is more focused on being electronic, complex and anthemic. And all while they did well on the opening, the album goes downhill right after the indeed musically complex \\"Clocks No. 2\\" \\"Speed of Sound\\". In fact, that is all that is complex about the album so far: the music. This is where we won't see eye-to-eye here. The rest is just kind of bland, and \\"Twisted Logic\\" takes it all downhill lyrically but does alright musically, until they hit you with the reversed cymbal crashing. The very last song, \\"'Til Kingdom Come\\" (which channels country and should have really been on their live album as unreleased), plays ressurection. Now, this isn't Coldplay's actual masterpiece (That's A Rush of Blood to the Head.) But you can sure say that they have tried hard enough, only to find it really wasn't worth the sweat at the very beginning. <br /> <br />Rating: 5/10 <br />
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I hope the Pacific Ocean is as blue as I think it is. I hope.<br /><br />This is really the perfect movie; not one single flaw, and every second of film is important and meaningful to the plot and character development. Movies are not to be rushed through; they should be savored and enjoyed, and this one has it's own special place in moviemaking.<br /><br />I have never liked prison movies, but this one (and the Green Mile) transcends the genre. It is not really a movie about a prison, it is a movie about hope and the strength of the human spirit despite unbelievable obstacles. Tim Robbins, as Andy Dufresne, is fantastic. Very slow, calm and with a shy, quiet wit and a keen eye to the human frailties of his tormentors, notably the warden and the brutal prison guard, he adapts quickly and learns the ropes about how to survive in an atmosphere that few could. Morgan Freeman, who narrates in his beautiful, soothing voice, plays Red, Andy's best friend, and the relationship between the two is deeply moving.<br /><br />Andy bucks the system, often, but not just to show off or be a smart alec, to improve the lives of the prisoners who must survive under a primitve, sadistic regime, and to help them feel like men, and have a taste of freedom and dignity. The first night that Andy is there, a heavyset prisoner, very young, breaks down and calls for his mother; unfortunately, he pays a high price for his emotions, in the first scene that demonstrates the true evil that rules this dark, Gothic world.<br /><br />Tommy arrives, some years later, a young, brash criminal in the making, with a great sense of humor and defensive about his lack of education; notably, his inability to read...this is resolved by Andy, who takes the young man under his wing and teaches him letters and eventually, Tommy passes his test.<br /><br />The next scene that really shocked me was the warden's response to Tommy's story about who the real killer of Andy's wife was; via a confession from a former cellmate. The warden and most of the guards have a vested interest in keeping Andy right where he is, after finding out he was able to save them a lot of money on their income tax returns due to his banker's background. Far too valuable a man to lose just because he was unjustly charged.<br /><br />SPOILER!<br /><br />But Andy is nothing if not resourceful, and he has had years to plan his escape...and not only an escape but one that nets him hundreds of thousands of the warden's own money, blows the whistle on the atrocities that have been going on in the little fiefdom the warden so enjoyed as his own personal outlet for brutality, and a permanent freedom to do whatever he wants to do with the money to do it with.<br /><br />The ending is one of, if not the, most satisfying it has ever been my pleasure to see, and wonderfully satisfying after all the horrors these men have been put through. Red eventually wins his freedom, and departs the only place he knew for a world that is strange, unwelcoming, and hostile. I love the scene of Red, after having walked for miles through deserted fields, he comes upon a buried box that Andy had told him about, opens it and finds a nice wad of cash. He looks around several times, although in the middle of nowhere; he cannot believe there isn't someone watching him; after all, he has been watched 24/7 for several decades.<br /><br />This money is his ticket back to Andy, and a reunion that satisfies the soul.<br /><br />I watch this every time it is on TV, and every time I do, I find it as wonderful as the first time...and enjoy it just as much, if not more; it is a movie that doesn't lose impact after repeated viewings and actually makes you feel good after seeing it, because it proves that no matter how bleak things are in your life, someone else's is always worse, and things will get better if you only perservere...take a page from Andy's book and thank God for what you have.most of the guards have a vested interest in keeping Andy right where he is, after finding out he was able to save them a lot of money on their income tax returns due to his banker's background.

B0007Y4TVU|4.0|<br />When Limp Bizkit came out with a political album, knowing Limp Bizkit's dissolving fanbase, including me, I was wondering if I should buy the album. Especially since what I listened to on their album was no change at all, and didn't sound as political. And it seems that Limp Bizkit didn't bother to push the album at all on MTV. So that pretty much leaves the slot open for none other than Punk Rock impresarios System Of A Down. (Yes, they are punk. System Of A Down made it clear once they they aren't really metal, so it makes sense to call them punk, since they are ater political awareness). I hope that is not more than we can say for Part 1 of System of A Down's year album collective Hypnotize/Mezmerize, which I could have sworn was used in a Natalie Merchant tune. The front cover was made by Daron Malakian's dad, and if you will agree looks a little like Metal's answer to Homogenic somewhere...or is that the upcoming album? Anywho. <br /> <br />\\"Soldier Side\\" gives off grungy Metallica-like beginning that leads straight down to the poetic bomb that even the stray missile in Iraq couldn't match, \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" (The last 'B' means Bombs, not \\"booze\\"). As many of you could have guessed, Yes, the song is about the war in Iraq. (Stop griping about it! They are going to come! Geez!) The title compares the War In Iraq with a popular party, especially when they yelled to all of us, \\"WHERE THE F*** ARE YOU?!\\" Amazing. The next song \\"Revenga\\" did what both Kiss and Gang Of Four couldn't do: actually make political dance-rock actually ROCK. Well, maybe the Gang of Four, but get my point. And Kiss may not be Political, but Dynasty was a clear fluke at creating Rock N Roll Disco. \\"Cigaro\\", the chosen song that leaked but may not be to radio. It may not seem like it, but the song to me sounds like their version of Weird Al Yankovic making fun of Kelis' \\"Milkshake\\". Or is that just just them? Either way, it is not coming to radio soon. I'll say sure, because the chorus soundsjust like what I said about nine inch nails ending to \\"the hand that feeds\\": powerful in their own right, but unlike their oters f you even play this once, soeone is going to tease you to the extent where you will skip this song before you get a chace to enjoy it as much. Well, that is System Of A Down for you, No? <br /> <br />The next song, coincidentally sounds like a good candidate for the next single, \\"Radio/Video\\". This song sounds as if they created their own brand of Hardcore Ska, just don't call this \\"what could be the next Metallica album\\". \\"This Cocaine Makes Like I'm On This Song\\" is the shortest song on the album, and what I don't get abot this song is what is the real purpose of the line, \\"I hope your stepson doesn't eat the fish\\". Wha? I think that may be a part of the whole cocaine situation in the song, or is this supposed to be part 2 for Peephole? Either way. Eh. Moving on. The song is also one of those songs that created what Drowning Pool tried doing with \\"Bodies\\": creating Schizophrenic Metal bouncing off the walls in your local loony bin. <br /> <br />On the the best songs Daron co-wrote for the album is \\"Violent Pornography\\" telling about the lives of women doing erotic asphyxiation and doing things with a pickle on your local HBO and some teen's boys computer. Why this sounds like the best song on the album was the way that they execute the verses. \\"Question!\\" sounds too obvious that it was written by System Of A Down's main leader Serj Tankian, because who doesn't like starting off slow and melancholly and then fading out low enough to come back with a BANG!? \\"Old School Hollywood\\" is about Daron's experience playing baseball with \\"washed up hollywood\\". Okay. Must go on. The perfect ending sdong \\"Lost In Hollywood\\" shows System Of A Down being street smart about Hollywood and the victims that trust them. They make an observation that most people who go through Hollywood end up in a funk every movie or celebrity opportunity they take. This is the slowest song on the album clocking at a mere 5 minutes. This album sounds like System Of A Down pretty much stepped up their game (therefore topping their debut by a longshot), and from the sounds of it, we can't wait to hear what happens for Hypnotize. But we bet the album cover will not only be just as mezmorizing, but may surapass Bjork's Homogenic cover is hypotism by just a straight stare into the covers eyes. No? <br /> <br />Rating: 7.75/10 <br />
B0000BYM3K|4.0|It's all I hear, \\"Another Cookie-Cutter Album\\" from Iron Maiden! Let me ask you all a question?

Fans will not be happy just settling with a band at this point in the night after the second stage tests their patience with an interesting group. They are here because this is a Great band with a solid release of \\"Dance of Death\\". <br /> <br /> Didn't we all become fans of Iron Maiden because each LP, Tape, and CD that we grew up with was consistent? Besides sound quality, I am not sure a new Iron Maiden fan could tell you what track was what Album all they way to \\"Seventh Son\\". Isn't that why most bands succeed? <br /> <br /> I think we are all begging for a \\"Cookie-Cutter\\" CD from Metallica, AC/DC, etc. Thank God Iron Maiden actually recovered from the efforts of \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\" until Bruce's return. Bands are Bands and we like them for who they are. Most that try to re-invent the wheel fail and fall on their faces.  <br /> <br /> Cookie-Cutter and all, I found this CD to be very good with solid musical talent and excellent vocals from Dickinson. Just simple and straight forward. Excellent talents especially in \\"Paschendale\\" and \\"New Frontier\\". The balance of this cookie-cutter experience follows the typical Iron Maiden approach with a great mix of Heavy and Slow to Build tracks. <br /> <br /> Look to \\"Dance of Death\\" to bring you right back to the welcomed world of \\"The Number of the Beast\\".  <br /> <br /> Overall, this will not win any awards or be listed as the top 100 albums of all time, but this CD is a must for any Iron Maiden fan. And you should be pretty happy that that seventeen year old kid at Ozzfest bought the \\"Iron Maiden\\" tee instead of the tee coming from the common sound at Stage 2!  <br /> <br /> Imagine, Tens of Years later and new blood finds a solid CD entitled \\"Dance of Death\\". Go Buy It!
B000002C25|4.0|Why is evryone judging this album on the fact that it either sounds like the Beatles or the song is too long. Call it experimental, but this is one of their best albums. I listened to Morning Glory. I only enjoyed a few songs. As for this, well...: <br /> <br />1. D'You Know What I Mean?: The best single. \\"Come in a mess going out in style/I Ain't good looking, but I'm someone's child.\\" 8/10 <br />2. My Big Mouth: It says something about a plane. Chances are this is Liam's song about how everyone sees him as the angry member (no pun or insult intended) of Oasis. 9/10 <br />3. Magic Pie: Psychedelic Oasis at it's best with Noel front and center. 8/10   <br />4. Stand by Me: The best song to make up as friends with.  11/10 <br />5. I Hope, I Think, I Know Eh... 7/10 <br />6. Girl in the Dirty Shirt: A song best discribed as one about love with a girl different from the usual norm. Eh. It's cool. 5/10 <br />7. Fade In-Out: ot the best song on the album, yes. 4.5/10  <br />8. Don't Go Away: Love song worthy of Oasis's rifice spillage. Smile and grieve with ease. 7/10 <br />9. Be Here Now: The carnival like beginning song brought me through it. The song sounds real fun, but that seems to be all that it is. 6/10 <br />10. All Around the World: I think this song should be last because not only is this the longest song, but it sounds like the most perfect ending to a beautiful Oasis album. Connect the entire song to the reprise and you get a master piece. (Hey nobody complained when Jane's Addiction created \\"Three Days\\" 10ish minutes long and \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (In The Garden Of Eden)\\" was deemed 19 minutes long). 11/10 <br />11. It's Gettin' Better (Man!!): Enjoy life and hope it gets a lot better. The length just makes it better. 9/10 <br />12. All Round the World (Reprise): Look at 10. <br /> <br />You guys don't know my idea of creating my personal MTV to make songs better, anf for that, this album is an essential feature.  <br />
B0009I7NNA|2.0|I must have listened to waking the fallen 500 times fully through before retiring it to my CD case and onto my list of top 10 favorite albums. I listened to this once and gave it to my little sister so she could listen to it while she played with her barbies and easy bake oven. CD blew. I smell some Radio play in the near future. For all you Muffinlovers this will line up nicely with some Franz Fernindad or Modest Mouse on your local KROQ station. Hopefully we can expect something with a little more energy and edge to it next time.
B00097A5I6|5.0|It has been utterly difficult trying to find a way to listen to this album before hitting stores, but the more time I get the more time I get to balance out this discomfort with Oasis sounding like the heroes that made them what they are today, minus the fistfights between brothers. Now they have come back with what could be a gem called \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\". It is also utterly difficult to try and listen to other albums on the Internet while dealing with the fact that the albums on the Internet sounds way different than it does on headphones. Well, I'll make do and add some points. The first song \\"Turn Up The Sun\\" sounds summery enough to kick off their album beautifully and with a bit of influence from Blues music. Nonetheless, it sounds a bit like something that will reign better in your earpones to give you a view of light that Oasis gives. (What am I talking about?) \\"Mucky Fingers\\" next carries off the next suite of the album. \\"As you face your disease, you squeeze into the emperor's clothes,\\" sounds like they really got on top of the worries of changing you and what makes you the happy you you are. \\"Mucky Fingers\\" brings Noel up to the mike. \\"Lyla\\" brings them back to their joyful guitar playing and hidden Beatles emulation you would hear on Heathen Chemistry. Liam's famous scratchy voice leads \\"Lyla\\" into a more hopeful and spiritual direction. To tell you thetruth. the first time I heard the song, I thought it was the most boring and ripped of the stuff. (I always underestimate new singles on my first listen. Geez.) \\"Love Like A Bomb\\": \\"You turn me on/Loves like a bomb/blowing in my mind\\" seems like a pretty lackluster take on Oasis' idea to add a new \\"Songbird\\" and take on the last one. The last one was acoustic, and this one adds a bit more of appreciation, even adding the Middle-East-like guitar trick from \\"The Hindu Times\\" for good measure. (I sound so simple). \\"The Importance Of Being Idle\\" brings back Noel \\"My girlfirend told me you get a life/You're lazy/But I don't mind\\" shows Noel enjoys his break and decides to waste himself only to his expense. The best line so far is \\"I can't get a life if my heart's not in it.\\" Try not to move him unless you ask him to. \\"The Meaning Of Soul\\" seems like the hardest of the collection of songs. It is also, oddly, the shortest of the bunch. So it seems that Oasis has gotten their act together and poured their heart out on the album, which makes it all the more better.  <br /> <br />Then comes the infamous proof of existing truth rays when Liam writes a spiritually-inspired album about a struggle between him and his brother, ironically called \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\". This song not only sounds personal, but many may be skeptical about whether Noel and Liam are ready to bury the hatchet for good. Many may be happy. Many may not even try to debate on it since both Liam and Noel could care less either way. Whatever the matter, it is the standout song that reminds you plenty of \\"Stand By Me\\". Although the ending starts with the same utterly short and climactic musical expression that both annoyed and baffled me the last time I listened to Arcade Fire's \\"Wake Up\\". \\"Part of the Queue\\" decribes Noel looking aroud trying to gather himself all while overcoming a struggle. \\"Every beginning breaks it's own promise/I'm having trouble just finding my soul in this town.\\" See what I mean? \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\" is about fighting to be. The american dream seems out of whack, and there will be help to keep it going. Could this be a post-9/11 chant that rifles \\"What's going On?\\" We don't know but the album seems 1/4th mediocre but good enough to listen to for hope. \\"A Bell Will Ring\\": \\"The world is wide as your life is thin/so entertain your goals.\\" Can you ask for a better \\"just believe\\" song? \\"A Beel Will Ring\\", sung by Liam, adds his ingredients to complimenting both the cocoon and the worm to be and be it beautifully. \\"Let There Be Love\\" brings them to their most united to pull of a60's lovefest in the new millenium by declaring there be love and to waste it wisely. The ending jamsession is not only the emphasis, but a short take on their last sleeper track \\"All Around The World\\".  <br /> <br />So far the album is glorified and it may redeem them back their crown in Britpop. In other words, Coldplay may possibly be the next U2, but Oasis has what it takes to be the new Beatles, whether both fans like it or not. But like the Beatles, will they be able to keep their personal and musical status intact, unlike the lifetime feud between Paul McCartney and John Lennon? Will they be able to beat the alleged slump from their last three albums? We don't know but you bet your bottom dollar that they still have a bit of heart to spill and install to a crazy world like this one. And the close comparison makes the experience all worth it. <br /> <br />Rating: 9/10
B000059H99|5.0|This is an underdog story.  It is about beating all the odds.  This movie has simple dialogue.  The people that are in Rocky's neighborhood use broken english just like Rocky.  This dialogue is very realistic to our day.  The training scenes are cool especially when Rocky his hiting the raw meat.  The last fight against Apollo Creed is medium drama like when Rocky scores the first ever knockdown of champion Apollo Creed.  Rocky sure had some troubles on him before he became the famous boxer.  I remember when Rocky takes a beating during the opening scene and wins a wimpy fourty-three dollars.  the mob boss he works for is always treating Rocky like he is stupid or something.  Rocky also loses his locker which really ticks him off because he had had that locker for like seven years and Mickey gave it to another new boxer.  Rocky did some great things when he was not in the ring though.  He helped kids that lived around him like that girl that was smoking at night with a bunch of guys and Rocky knew that she had to be at home so he took her home and told her to stop smoking and using profanity.  He also liked pets because he would always go into the pet store where his future wife was.  I am glad this got best picture because it deserved it big time.  On the special features for this dvd there is commentary by the director and the theatrical trailer for each of the five Rocky films.  Buy it you sports fans.  God bless you and America.
B00082IJ08|4.0|It's official. It seems that Gorillaz is here to stay, and may probably have some more longetivity than any other cartoon band around. Gorrillaz came together to try their hand at blending music into a dark pop substance. With Gorillaz, the best way to enjoy this record is to not expect anything and to try and get everything they do with music...or try. Gorillaz is 2D (not Damon Albarn), Murdoc, Russel (not Del The Funkee Homosapien), and Noodle (not Miho Hatori). They do, however have guest stars on their album to help created a cynical corner for the album.  <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed, the album starts off with demonic music to give you imagery of cynicism put in place by Gorillaz. \\"Last Living Souls\\" starts off with a possible keyboard beat while 2D wonders about whether he may be the only one of the bunch to see another sunrise. \\"Kids With Guns\\" takes on a dark day when children die of dissatisfaction and murder. The music supports the call that \\"guns don't kill people, we do.\\" And that is why we waste away so. The beat makes me think of kids in war that uses guns to try and perfect life of theirs, but it just makes it worse. \\"O Green World\\" has melody is Ladytron Frankenstein, which sets up for modern harmonizing and a plead to keep living in a sad world as long as he survives it well. In this one, Gorillaz talkes New Wave and uses it to a dark advantage. \\"Dirty Harry\\", which I suspect is a name title picked my Murdoc, is another Clint Eastwood reference, but sounds more like the 70's soul-funk, which has a guest star, Booty Brown of The Pharcyde. The beat is constructed by Mr. Danger Mouse, who creates the bands hip-hop beats on this album. I dion't really get the purpose of the children on \\"Dirty Harry\\", but when you are creating your music experimentality comes into play. First single \\"Feel Good Inc.\\", guest star De La Soul gives a feel good band with once again a collection of worryful lines, until the trippy guitar plays to unleash a poetic feelof 2D's feelgood lyrics, which comes straight back to the De La Soul cut in of \\"Don't stop, get it, get it\\" and pretty haunting execution of demon laughter. \\"El Manana\\" sings melancholy and low with a beat that Four Tet would be able to create: summery guitar riff with a loveable execution of drum machines and poetry of love. Next comes \\"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead\\" featuring a legendary musician and workaholic Ike Turner, who possibly plays the burlesque funk that he used to execute with former flame Tina Turner. So far, Gorillaz experiment with pop music and other music to create their own aura. \\"November Has Come\\" features Russel coming back to freestyle. \\"All Alone\\" involves Trip-Hoppers Martina Topley-Bird and Roots Manuva, the reggae MC. Amazingly the music didn't make you appreciate the other singers music, rather than to just add on to their aura of down anthems. \\"White Light\\" is just 2D whispering \\"white light alcohol\\" over a forceful beat. Happy Mondays' Shaun Ryder is on \\"DARE\\" with a more danceable beat, and 2D comes in this time with a falsetto to set the feel good mood after all of that grieving. Actor Dennis Hopper guest stars on \\"Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey's Head\\" which is consistent of interpretive reading over music by Danger Mouse, mostly. \\"Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey's Head\\" feels like Gorillaz' \\"Ancestors\\" (see Bjork's \\"Ancestors\\" on Medulla) as it could have summed up plenty. Dennis Hopper is reading about the voice of the villagers. \\"Don't Get Lost In Heaven\\" shows Gorillaz play the type of music normally you wold hear at the intro of a dream sequence, which is what I can say about master ender \\"Demon Days\\". Who expected this from dark pop music? The song may have a dream sequence dream singing, but it all turns to a ska-like beat with choir singing, chronicling an all around stable end to a conceptually constructed album. Gorillaz used to be about the type of music that creates all types of music in one, but when was the last time Beck has used a guest star on certain songs, not counting beat creation? <br /> <br />Rating: 6.75/10 <br />
6305144176|4.0|This is one movie experience that you shouldn't miss! Get a dose of Robin Williams' outstanding comic yet brilliant acting for this Barry Levinson film about the era when war torn out Vietnam. I have seen this fil for four times already and I could say that this movie truly capitulates the importance of humor in the middle of tense and severe situation. Yeah, we all know that we shouldn't take this situation as funny but hey, life isn't all about struggle...humor lightens it.
B00005Q3TZ|1.0|Let's just talk about this DVD set! I bought it cause I had no other choice. At first, it looks an attractive DVD set for everyone but it has one of the wrorst packagings I've ever seen :<br /><br />1. It has not any hard outer case. the whole case looks like a briefcase. made from hard paper and could easiliy be damaged! and there is no protection against shelf dust for interior components.<br /><br />2. 4 Discs are in paper sleeves. remove them from the sleeves is rather hard and it could permanently bend the sleeves. no need to tell that, every time, you need to clean your finger prints from DVD Surfaces. and placing scratches on DVDs during put in or remove out is very possible!<br /><br />3. they seald 4 paper sleeves with a steeker, not a sequrity tag, a steeker which is suppose to be part of your collection.<br /><br />don't be fool with amazon.com's beautiful picture of this set. It's only as big as a regular DVD case and I don't think adding some postal cards is a really big deal!<br /><br />if you want to have this DVD set, I Strongly suggest you to buy it used and select a cheap one. cause if you buy it new, there is no way for you to keep it like new except never remove it from the shrink rap!
B0006L16N8|5.0|It's hard to believe but it's been three years since Coldplay released A Rush of Blood to the Head. Now they are back with their third record X&Y. All of Coldplay's releases share one thing in common; they take some time getting into. When I first listened to Parachutes in the fall of 2000 I was not impressed. After a week it was the only thing I listened to for a six months. When A Rush of Blood to the Head came out it also took a few weeks for it to grow on me. The same thing applies to X&Y.<br /><br />Starting off with the opening track \\"Square One\\" it is apparent that the record is a little more sonically dense than the band's previous efforts. While X&Y is a far cry from being experimental it's just enough of a change to make the new songs fresh. \\"What if\\" starts off as a slow piano song that finally builds up to a crescendo that exemplifies the transformation of Coldplay's sound. \\"Fix You,\\" \\"White Shadows,\\" Low\\" and \\"Twisted Logic\\" are instantly fan favorites. The hidden track \\"Til Kingdom Comes\\" was written for the late great Johnny Cash who passed away before he could record the song. It is a shame Cash did not get a chance to record it, but it makes a fitting and positive end to the album.<br /><br />X&Y was a long time in coming but it was worth every bit of the wait. I cannot wait to hear how these new songs translate live. As one of the most eagerly anticipated albums of the year Coldplay does not disappoint with X&Y.
B000001FDK|3.0|If you've ever watched \\"Grease\\" the movie, you would definitely tantalized to buy this album. That movie is one of the greatest musicals has ever made. I enjoyed every song and every scene of it and ordered the CD soundtrack from amazon.com <br />But this CD rather dissapointed me. first of all, it's quality is not good and sounds are not sharp. second, the quality of print and packaging is awful. it's more like one of that cheap bootleg CDs made in Singapore. yeas, made in singapore not China cause it's quality is better than chinese media products. An ordinary black jewel case with a low quality inside card. no inlay and a single sided back cover. All dark and low in quality. CD itself has no print on it except some words and writings. everyone knows a good coverage of print, protects CD from scratches but in this case,yu'll even be sick of cleaning your fingerpirints from cd printable surface. I was not satisfied with this product. I suggest you try 2 discs remastered edition of this album which is availale in amazon.com! I've heard that it's quality is better than this one!

B0002IVN9W|5.0|(The following review was posted on amazon June 7, 2005 and below it is my added comments from June 11, 2006)    I don't even know where to begin. Every track on this album is awe-inspiringly amazing, using a massive variety of instruments to create a joyously beautiful sound. Oasis was my favorite band before this album (mainly due to their older stuff rather than their later stuff) and before that it was Our Lady Peace...but I have never, ever, EVER come across an album that is as incredible as this one. My friend got me to listen to Rebellion (Lies) and I was hooked. From there, I got more and more excited with each track that I heard. I just could not believe how incredible the music I was hearing was.    This is the first album I've bought since Our Lady Peace's Spiritual Machines. You know that old question where you're given a choice of one album to bring with you if you get stuck on an island? This is it, that album that you'd want to bring with you. My previous favorite album (Definitely Maybe) does not come close to this incredible work.    Some of the slower songs took a little longer to grow on me (Une Annee, 7 Kettles) but once I gave them some time, I loved them just as much as the rest of the album.    Frankly, I have a hard time picking favorites on this album cause just about every song is my favorite. But Wake Up really stands out, as well as Neighborhood #1 (Laika) and Neighborhood #2 (Tunnels). But seriously, this is one of those brilliant albums where there is no filler. I've been listening to this album nonstop for the past month and it won't get out of my head.    I honestly have never experienced a band that I've been as excited about as Arcade Fire. And judging from the momentum they have right now, they're gonna be big. Bowie, David Byrne, Bjork, Coldplay, and Beck have all listed themselves as fans, and for good reason.    I've only ever really been to one concert but I am getting tickets to the Guelph Hillside Fest in July just to go seethem (I live in Ottawa). I don't know what more I can do to convince someone reading this to check them out except that I don't think I'll ever get to experience another album as good as Funeral.    EDITED TO ADD (on Jun 11, 2006):    So it's been a year since I wrote the above and first heard the Arcade Fire and I thought I'd just reiterate how much I love this album. It's been over a year since I first heard the Arcade Fire and I have lost none of my love for this album. It is easily the defining album of music for me - the album that I could listen to on repeat non-stop for the next year and not get sick of it.    And I'd like to just comment on some of the things people who disliked this album have said - people are not giving this five stars just cause \\"everyone else is doing it\\". At least, speaking for myself, I sure wasn't. I didn't listen to a lot of indie when I first heard Rebellion (Lies) - I didn't know who they were - but I LOVED this song and something about it just compelled me to check out the rest of the songs on this album - and it blew me away, before I knew that this band was hyped up etc...    And I think it's worth it for anyone to check this album out - there's always going to be people who hate something others like (and that's just personal preferences and taste - for example - I think Crash is a terrible movie but I'm definitely in the minority there) - but this album will have such a big impact on so many people that it's worth it to give it a shot, even if you end up being one of the few people who hate the album. Cause for every one person who hates this album, there's another five who are blown away.    As for the one-star reviews which say the Arcade Fire have no songwriting abilities? Those reviews I cannot understand at all. If nothing else, the one thing I'd think everyone would be able to appreciate are their songwriting abilities. And the music is certainly catchy...    This is the album that got me into indie. This is the album that changed my musical taste - not that it wasn't already evolving, but this album pushed it further, faster. I owe discovering The Flaming Lips and countless other bands to this initial album. Not to say that the stuff I've discovered because of them has all been great - but I'm just trying to point out the impact this album has had on me. I think I'm going to leave off this edited review with an excerpt from my MSN Space back last May when I had first started listening to the Arcade Fire...it perfectly sums up my Arcade Fire obsession.    \\"I'm sorry, I really am. But I can't get Arcade Fire out of my mind. Not even my three absolute favorite artists (OLP before Gravity, Oasis, and Elliott Smith) had this kind of addictive impact on me.    Funeral has been spinning in my CD player nonstop at school, on the bus, and blasting from the sound system at home - yes, I even studied math last night while it was playing. Not to mention just scrounging up anything I can on Arcade Fire and their shows. The more I read about the meanings of their songs, the better they are. The more I watch their performances (on Conan, Joel Grey, etc), the more stunned I am. The more I listen to their songs, the better they get (the two that I found a bit weaker for me were Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles) and Une Annee Sans Lumiere which have both become great tracks after a few listens). There honestly is not one weak track on this album. Not one.    Every single track could be an awesome single. And I'd say Neighborhood #1-3, Wake Up, Rebellion (Lies), and In the Backseat are my favorites on this album, except that's already 60% of the album right there + the others could almost just as easily be exchanged for any of these songs and the quality level wouldn't drop. This is not hyperbole - I absof*ckinlutely love this album even with the short time I've had it and I can't imagine that I'll ever buy or listen to another album that surpasses this. EVER. None of my favorite bands or artists have outputted an album that comes close to this.    And the incredible metaphorical cycle put forward by Neighborhood #1-4 is amazing. Not to mention the stunning instrumentation of their songs. This is stuff that works on every level. If based solely on this CD, Arcade Fire would easily be my favorite band. For sure, they're one of my favorite bands now.\\"    -And yes, since then Arcade Fire has become my favorite band.

B0006L16N8|5.0|What an album!. Most beautiful amazing music ever made on the planet or off since Radiohead's Ok Computer. I have listen to the whole album 10 times complete and I adore it. I am impressed. <br /> <br />Everything work brilliantly here. Lyrics, music, production, instruments, voices, soundscapes, etc. Wonderfully intense performed. <br /> <br />Songs like What If, Square One, The Hardest Part, White Shadows, X & Y or A Message are probably the best pieces of music of this century. The whole album is flawless, absolutely flawless. <br /> <br />Probably this album will be as Led Zeppelin III: unfairly ignored by the \\"critics\\", but addictive and sublime. And I'm happy they didn't want to keep the same sound of AROBTTH. <br /> <br />Do not listen to aging dinosaurs as U2 and Oasis...by the way, to those sellouts: this is a lesson of music, so you better listen to it and try to learn!. <br /> <br />Coldplay is now an astonishing way to know what does MUSIC means. <br />Thank you. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|I'v been listening to this album the whole day and I love it. Yeah sure there are the few okay songs but most of them are spectacular. Coldplay really establishes themselves with this album as a follow to their other smash albums. Track 5 titled talk is my personal favorite but they are all worth listening to.
B00097DX3U|5.0|While the bands dabut (2001) selftitled Audioslave was a good album, Out Of Exile is even better. The first album was put out before they ever even played their first show, Out Of Exile was put out after a world tour. They didnt quite know how to fuse the two bands of Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine together since they hadnt really played together but here on Out Of Exile them seem to have found their muse and fused the two bands together perfectly into something music and rock fans in particular have been waiting for. Chris Cornells vocals through the album are amazing as always never unwanted nor over the top. Tom Morello's guitar playing has never been better. His guitar solo's are more elaborate, more noticable, and for once he doesnt let his effects out shine his natural ability as a fantastic guitar player, Brad Wilk and Tim Commerfords rythem is as good as it has ever been, this truly is the album that I think will set the standard for Audioslave albums to come.<br /><br />Opening the album is the anti-war song 'Your Time Has Come.' Tome Morello's intro guitar riff sets the pass for the whole album, and his guitar solo is easily the best guitar solo the man has ever played, I just hope he can pull it off live. The title track 'Out Of Exile' contains a cool chorus. If there is one thing that no one will ever be albe to take away from Chris Cornell is that the man always has been one to write a killer chorus and this album is a testament to that. 'Be Yourself' was the first single off of the album and is easily my favorite song on the album. Catchy chorus, great lyrics and vocals that perfectly complament Morello's beautiful guitar melody. Almost bluesy but not quite is 'Doesnt Remind Me' which is almost Led Zeppelib-esq, which is understanable seeings how Robert Plant is Cornells all time hero. Once again another very strong chorus. 'Drown Me Slowly' is kind of like Doesnt Remind Me but heavier, and with more attitude, it's one of the better songs on the album. The next song 'Heavens Dead' may be the best song Audioslave has recorded. 'Its a slow almost power ballad, with an awesome chorus and one of the best bridges I think a song has ever had. Chris Cornells lyrics are some of the best he has ever written, it'll be hard to top this one. The next song 'The Worm' is a amazing song you'll have to hear. The way the song is sung is so amazing, and the lyrics are so personal. I at the age of sixteen can really relate to the lyrics, which is why I love the song so much. Truly a brilliant song, I think they should release it as a songle personaly. 'Man Or Animal' is sort of a dont hurt animals and become vegetarians type song. Which makes you think whatever. But if you listen to it, it is more then that, its about how the life of an animal is no less percious then that of a humans, which I personaly think is a pretty cool message. 'Yesterday To Tomorrow' is a really beautiful song. I love the lyrics to this song, I have no clue what they mean but this is just a really beautiful song. This is wear the album gets kinda weak. 'Dandelion' is a strange name for a rock song but it's actually pretty good and has a nice chorus, while the same can be said for the chorus' in '#1 Zero,' and 'The Curse' these songs are not as strong as the rest of the album, while they are sill pretty decent songs, I happen to think the band could have done better on them, their not totaly terrible. While the end of the album is not a bad as the end to Audioslaves first album its not great either.<br /><br />As you can see Out Of Exile is a great album that no rock fan should be without. Do yourself a favor and pick it up, and if you liked Audioslave's first album you'll love Out Of Exile!n the album. The next song 'Heavens Dead' may be the best song Audioslave has recorded.

B0006L16N8|5.0|This is, without a doubt, Coldplay's best album to date. The music and lyrics are more mature than A Rush Of Blood To The Head. The music takes you places. It is sad and uplifting at the sametime. It didnt seem like they could make a better album than A Rush Of Blood To The Head but they have. The only problem Coldplay has is: Where are they going to go from here? How do you perfect a masterpiece? The top tracks are \\"What If\\" and \\"Fix You\\" Absolutley amazing album that brought me to tears.
B00028HBKC|1.0|It was funny to see all the concern with the myth of Christ (until I get real proof, this is only a mythical story, not much different from the promethean myth or many others)It was painfully obvious to me that the director conviniently forgot the apalling number of people who were, in actuality, tortured and ultimately sacrificed (in the most horrendous ways, by the way) in the name of this character and the religion(s) built around him. Let's not forget that there is still an Inquisition lurking in the vatican halls (under another name, of course)Let's not forget that millions of people who have been tortured through the ages since Christianity decided to forget the principles that alledgedly was built around. <br />It is time christianity were placed before the mirror of its own cruelties and it is urgent, in the case of this movie, to remember that Christianity has not earned the right to be throwing stones around. Mel Gibson, obviously, has not gotten to the point where he can recognize any of this.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I Loved This Movie as a Kid and  To THis day at 19 Years Old I still Enjoy the Movie.. Great Movie !
B0009A1AS2|5.0|First of all, I have been a die-hard Dream Theater fanatic since 1989 so my reviews might be considered \\"Biased\\" but I will try to be as objective as possible.   <br /> <br />For the first time in a long time, the first 2 tracks off the new DT CD didn't impress me.  I am not saying that they are bad but I just feel that they were somewhat \\"Stale\\" and regurgitated, reminding me of tracks from \\"Train of Thought\\" and \\"Anna Lee\\" from Falling Into Infinity\\".   <br /> <br />Things got better with \\"These Walls\\" and the VERY U2 sounding \\"I Walk Beside You\\" but then came \\"Panic Attack\\" and I got those old goosebumps that DT has given me over the past 16 years.  This song just rocks your sock off and could have easily been on Train of Thought.  \\"Never Enough\\" is a good song but the CD really get exciting and worth the money when you get to the last 2 songs, especially the title track \\"Octavarium\\".  This is what Dream Theater is about...it's hard, it's mellow, it's both. it's complex, it's ORCHESTRA!!...It's AWESOME!  Can you say another epic in the mold of \\"Change of Seasons\\"?? <br /> <br />I CANNOT WAIT to see some of these songs live, especially \\"Octavarium\\".  Like any Dream Theater CD, this CD will (and is) get better with every listen because it is just impossible to absorb the complexity and beauty with one or two listens.  That is why I love these guys so much...their CDs don't get old fast and they give you a LOT of good music to digest.  <br /> <br />It is unfair to rate this CD to other Dream Theater CDs because I need to listen to it about another 300 times! 8-)  However, as far as first impressions go, I would rate it over \\"Train of Thought\\" (mainly due to the versatility of this CD...not just \\"Heavy\\") but definitely lower than \\"Scenes From a Memory\\", which I consider the best CD ever, PERIOD!.    <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you are an old time Dream Theater fan like me, you will love this CD because it contains all the elements of \\"Classic DT\\".  However, if you came onboard the \\"Train of Thought\\" CD, this CD might shock you because only 2 of the songs (\\"Panic Attack\\" and \\"The Root of all Evil\\") are heavy enough to qualify.  Still, if you are a musician or just appreciate beautiful, complex music by the greatest ensemble of musicians in one band on the planet...BUY THIS CD NOW!
B0006L16N8|5.0|So many people keep getting caught up with whether the band is evolving fast enough, how they compare to other bands, how X&Y differs (or doesn't) from parachutes/rush of cold blood, etc. <br /> <br />i'm not saying those aren't things worth discussing. <br /> <br />but just for a second forget about all of that and really listen to this music - and think about how it feels. <br /> <br />Coldplay's songs are filled with harmonic genius. There's a lushness to them that is completely unmatched, and the pure emotion in this music makes X&Y one of the most amazing albums I've ever listened to.
0743243315|3.0|I didn't really like Brick Lane (though I respected it), which is full of longeurs as we go through the dreary life of a Bangla immigrant in London, punctuated when things got too dull with animplausible series of dramas that I guess was supposed to appeal to females: kids in trouble!  middle-aged wives can have hot sex!  to heck with men!  and so on. <br /> <br />All of this was interspersed with semi-literate letters from the sister who remained in Bangladesh, which reminded me how annoying accent fiction is, and I guess was supposed to illustrate that life for woman Banglas sucks, whether in Dhaka or Durham. <br /> <br />All in all, it seemed like a quality fiction effort marred by an attempt at becoming an Oprah pick, and I can only assume the critics all embraced it because some of the characters - Chanu, the inept husband, and Mrs. Islam, the terrifying neighbor - are richly drawn.  That and because it's always nice to recommend a novel by an Islamic writer that touches on 9/11.  We're a tolerant people after all - look at how we've embraced Brick Lane.
B0006L16N8|4.0|this can be seen as a good album but it is not great compared to rush of blood. rush of blood had songs that could be remembered and the would be stuck in your mind. here, however the songs sound quite alike on the first listen and you ownt be singing along as you did to rush of blood's scientist or in my place. there is nothing amazing and grounbreaking that put coldplay aside like yellow or the scientist. most songs are just decent and i do not think speed of sound is good compared to other great coldplay songs. <br /> <br />most importantly this album is more distorted than any other and the vocals are not as dominating as in other albums except for in  'a message' and some other songs. many of my friends think that coldplay is overrated and being a huge fan i defend coldplay but i think this album will just add strength to their argument and should have not be rated as 5 stars by others. It is decent but is no way as great as rush of blood. i still love coldplay and will be listening to this album for some time now. i think ill get into it the more i listen to it. since it was released on my birthday,i got a copy of it quite soon and i will still recommend people to buy it. <br /> <br />favourite songs, white shadows, fix it, x&y, prefer the second half to the first half.
B0002OERI0|4.0|This is a decent album. American Idiot is by far the best song. It's a nice fast heavier sound. They also slow it down in some parts of the cd with Blvd of Broken Dreams, and Wake Me Up When Sept Ends. The production is pretty good, it sounds like it should. I also like the upbeat St Jimmy. Thats a good fast tune. Towards the end of the cd they slow it down a lot, and it starts to get old. But my biggest problem with this cd, isn't the cd, but the radio. They overplayed blvd so much that its one of my least listened to songs on the cd. I also think they give Holiday too much credit, that ones just ok for me. But overall, good cd, if you like hard rock but not metal, or both, pick this one up, you'll like it. The end.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|DT is my favorite band,  I have been itching for the release of this album for quite sometime. This album is very good but it did not blow me away, James latest album is much better then this thing, Man I want sick riffs with some crazy double bass to get my blood flowing.  Get rid of the keyboard guys it's not needed.
B000089RVX|3.0|And i probably should have stuck wth the single. There are some other good ones on here (Going Under, Tourniquet, My Last Breath) but I wouldn't say that is enough to make me want to buy it. It does have a cool sound though, especially with the choir backing them up, but that's not enough. The worst song is My Immortal, a song for the Goth. I would recommend buying this cd cheap used, not new, your $s not worth it.
B0002858YS|5.0|The Killers sound like a lot of great British synth rock bands from the 80s; The Cure, Blur, but most of all like Duran Duran! Amazing to find out that they are actually a US band.<br /><br />`Somebody told me' is the best song Duran Duran never recorded. Wow! It features some fierce scratching guitar and some really great vocals, all of which builds up to a very catchy disco chorus with lyrics like `somebody told me/you had a boyfriend/looks like a girlfriend..' similar to the gender bending referencing of Franz Ferdinand.<br /><br />In a similar vein is `Midnight hour', another highly infective rock/dance number.<br /><br />Opening track `Jenny was a friend of mine' starts off with some helicopter sound effects, great dance beats kick in, synths blazing and swirling guitars, and then  the best Duran Duran vocal impression since, well Duran Duran! Brilliant.<br /><br />`Mr Brightside' is an upbeat rocker sounding very much like Blur; half spoken lyrics and an almost mumbled but great chorus.<br /><br />`Smile like you mean it' features some twilight zone-like sound effects and a sing-a-long chorus, similar vocally to The Cure.<br /><br />`All these things that I've done' starts off a vaguely Beatles-ish ballad, which kicks into a great rocker with an almost choir-like segment.<br /><br />`Andy you're a star' is a sluggish sounding rocker, with some Cure like vocals again.<br /><br />All these Blur/Duran/Cure etc influences should have been cloying and annoying but what saves the day is the fact that the songs are GREAT!<br /><br />Next influence channeled is Oasis on `Glamorous indie rock and roll' which starts off gentle and features semi shouted vocals and a killer chorus. This track is however on the UK import version.<br /><br />`On top' is another Durannie influenced great pop/rock song.<br /><br />All in all, a great debut, packed with tonnes of potential singles.
B000021YQV|5.0|This cd is very well put together. If you read my other reviews you'll know I don't do this often. I'll rate each song. <br /> <br />1) Prison Song- Very political, good lyrics, cool intro 10/10 <br /> <br />2) Needles- I didn't like this one very much the lyrics are lacking, but they get the point of the song stuck in your head, that's for sure 4/10 <br /> <br />3) Deer Dance- I like this one it has great music, the guitars sound really cool 9/10 <br /> <br />4) Jet Pilot- The low point on this cd I DONT GET WHAT ITS ABOUT!!!!!!! 3/10 <br /> <br />5)X- Not bad, it's got a nice tune, the lyrics are like Needles (keep repeating the same thing to make a point) 8/10 <br /> <br />6) Chop Suey- Definitely a cd highlight, for sure top three on cd <br /> <br />7) Bounce- Not very good in any way, the lyrics are mostly comic, serj sounds like hes drunk, so it's kinda funny... 5/10 <br /> <br />8) Forest- Not much to say, I've never liked it much but others do 6.5/10 <br /> <br />9) Atwa- Starts slow but explodes later on, one of the best three on here 10/10 <br /> <br />10) Science- Kind of like Forest it's only ok for me 7/10 <br /> <br />11) Toxicity- Great song, great lyrics, amen. 9/10 <br /> <br />12) Shimmy- If it was 4 minutes long it would be the best song on the cd, but it's only 2 8/10 <br /> <br />13) Psycho- Vocals are good in this one, it starts out kind of techno style 9/10 <br /> <br />14) Aerials- Maybe the best song on the cd, cept there's this weird outro, it's this primitive music with people chanting, very strange 10/10 (without chanting) 8/10 (with chanting) <br /> <br />Overall great cd it may not sound like a 5 star cd but trust me it is.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Expecting a high octane dance/electronica CD? Think again. Well, you do get some of that in `Nobody knows me' and the excellent jerky, razor sharp Bond theme song `Die another day'(featuring a dramatic string backdrop to Madonna's singing about killing your ego), but for the most part, what we get is Madonna's most personal, stripped down, bare release yet! Probably her most hard to get into Cd which explains why it debuted at no.1 on the billboard hot 200 albums but hasn't yet sold a million copies.<br /><br />Now she's a wife, a mother of two children, and in her forties, she takes a look back at life and raises different questions. Some of the tracks are semi autobiographical.<br /><br />Like the nostalgic 'Mother & father' which starts off in a little girlie voice singing and asking for her mother whom she lost when she was 6, and which bubbles and builds to a disco climax. It also features a sad rap about the time her mother died, especially when she confesses she didn't realise all the pain her father was going through. A great song.<br /><br />There is `Easy ride', a sweeping epic ballad that starts off with delicate acoustic guitar strumming, and where she mentions she would like to `find my place, and breathe the air and feel the sun on my children's face'. Swirling electronic effects step in towards the end. Very ambitious and it works.<br /><br />`Intervention' is another acoustic (almost folk sounding) guitar driven song in which she declares that she `knows that love will change us forever'. Beautiful guitar strumming, a delicate beat, and great vocal harmonizing, especially in the chorus. Outstanding!<br /><br />There's quite a bit of religious referencing, especially in the tender acoustic ballad `X-static process' which again features great vocal harmonizing and no drums.<br /><br />The absolute highlight of this collection has got to be `Nothing fails'. Again, this starts off as a tender acoustic ballad with a gentle beat which about two thirds through breaks into some awesome choir layering (last heard on `Like a prayer). This song just has to be heard to be believed!<br /><br />Not everything is deep and pensive though. We have the breezy light retro pop of `Hollywood' and the delightful `Love profusion' which starts off as another acoustic ballad which kicks into a delightful, upbeat declaration of love. The title track and `I'm so stupid' are my least favourites though. However, I don't see what all the fuss is about her 'rapping'. I think it's fun and fits in very well with the two songs concerned. She's not exactly out to grab Jay Z or Eminem's crowns.<br /><br />10 out of 10. Almost her best CD yet (behind `Ray of light', `Music' and `Bedtime stories').<br /><br />Rather deep and introspective, but brilliant all the same.t heard on `Like a prayer).

B00008H2LB|4.0|This cd was good until the radio ruined all the songs by overplaying them. That said, it has never been as good as Hybrid theory, but it isn't bad. It's just different. There are some good ones on here and there are some bad ones on here (a characteristic Hybrid Theory doesn't share). The best song is Lying from You, because it sounds the closest to HBT. It's a new sound, and even though it isn't as good, it could be for the best. Cut them some slack, how can you follow up a HBT? I'ts pretty hard to do, and I think they did a pretty good job. I would definitely buy HBT before you buy this. One other comment, I haven't taken this out since January, whereas I am listening to Hybrid Theory right now. This one gets older faster.

B00004Z459|5.0|This is a very good album. Linkin Park is a really good band with some really good ideas. Song ratings: <br /> <br />1) Papercut- My personal favorite, awesome intro, great vocal maybe the best on the cd, no problem here 10/10 <br /> <br />2) One Step Closer- The first Linkin Park song I ever heard, this is what got me started, good music 9/10 <br /> <br />3) With You- One of the worse ones, I just never liked it much 7/10 <br /> <br />4) Points of Authority- Great one, best lyrics on the cd except In the End possibly 10/10 <br /> <br />5) Crawling- Slower, a good change of pace, my favorite at one point, good lyrics but not much guitar or huge vocals in this one 8/10 <br /> <br />6) Runaway- This one of songs that lots of people think is garbage, true it's mostly screaming and rapping, but it grew on me, give it a chance 7.5/10 <br /> <br />7) By Myself- Another one that doesn't get enough respect, this one grew on me too 8/10 <br /> <br />8) In the End- Great melody, gets better and better as it goes, great lyrics, cool intro 9.5/10 <br /> <br />9) A Place For My Head- Nice heavy song but not much vocal sound 8.5/10 <br /> <br />10) Forgotten- Great lyrics, fast and hard the whole time, flows well from A Place For My Head 10/10 <br /> <br />11) Cure For the Itch- just ok it's a short instrumental, and no it doesn't cure itching 7/10 <br /> <br />12) Pushing Me Away- One that most people seem to like a lot, for me it's just allright not the best closer 7/10 <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very good cd. Anyone who says this is rap, it's not. Rap has no real instruments it's just a beat with some guy talking about junk. This has some real guitar and it does have good vocals though not all the time. I would recommend this cd to any metal fans. It will grow on you if you don't like it at first.
0440238609|1.0|I've read some of the reviews, and I agree with the widely-held opinion that the first book was fantastic, the second was fair to good, and the third was terrible. I don't care too much what the author's personal opinions about religion are - although I think what he says is totally ridiculous - but his writing turns into just a prolonged ranting, and that I can't stand. Also, there are a lot of loose ends and a lot of things left unexplained (especially the climax and the resolution, which one would expect to be the parts best explained), making the entire third book very disapointing. Oh, and yes, this book is NOT, I repeat, NOT for kids.<br /><br />All of that has been said already. The only thing I'd like to add is that the morals of the story (other than that organized religion is the source of all evil) are very confusing. Lyra hates her uncle (leader of the anti-God group, representing Satan) and looks at him as an evil man, one who will sacrifice children for his own goals. Yet the rest of the story makes him out to be the hero! [And doesn't that show that the church is NOT the source of all evil? Yet the book's conclusion leaves little doubt that \\"the church is evil\\" is the main theme!?] I hear that Pullman said in an interview that he basically agrees with Lyra's uncle. So, in other words, he agrees with sacrificing kids so as to fight people who sacrifice kids? All in all, very confusing.
B000023X9W|5.0|Definitivamente este es uno de los discos mas infravalorados del catalogo del seor Young, y es una lastima.....porque esta a la altura de sus clasicos discos folk como harvest moon, harvest y comes a time. <br />Para esta ocasion, el viejo canadiense ha invitado a varios guerreros de muchas batallas musicales con el, como los son el \\"Steel pedal man\\" Ben Keith, \\"Duck\\" Dunn en el bajo, y Spooner Oldham en los teclados (como pueden ver toda una alineacion especialista en folk-country music). <br />El resultado no podia ser otro que excelente y exquisito para los amantes de este genero. El disco esta lleno de nostalgia y sentimiento en cada una de sus liricas y notas. Algunas canciones como el titulo de la obra y Razor Love, eran canciones del extenso catalogo del seor Young, que no habian sido nunca grabadas en estudio, y que en esta ocasion desempolvo para alegria de sus fans; y eso que practicamente entrego algunas de las selecciones de este album para la reunion con Crosby, Stills y nash en el 99. <br />En resumen, el disco es para escucharlo solo, preferible en casa y concentrado en cada una de los temas. <br />Descarga noltalgica, que tal vez tenga como unico defecto su corta duracion (10 temas en menos de 40 minutos como los antiguos vinilos). Disfrutenlo, que esto es lo mejor que sabe hacer este maestro.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Back from the nebulous wastelands of conflicting musical identity that were Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and Train of Thought. Neither of these two were bad albums, per se, each having their moments of brilliance, but neither matched up to the impossibly high standards the band set for themselves with Images and Words, their second album, and Awake, the third. But Octavarium is lightyears ahead of their last few mixed-bag releases, taking the best elements of their evolution in style and musical ability, with an infusion of a new passion, and doing away with the rest: the wastefulness, the questionable songwriting, and (critics of ToT, breathe a heavy sigh) the rap. Even the album's one reference to Train of Thought, the chorus to \\"Dying Soul\\" played during \\"Root of All Evil\\", sounds better in the new context of Octavarium. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed both of Dream Theater's previous albums, having never been one of DT's \\"disenchanted fans\\", but they lacked the magic that was strongest with IaW and was never seen to such a degree again. Until now. Octavarium has the magic again. It is brilliant. It is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />A part of the problem with the previous few albums was their emphasis on the album as a whole rather than the songs, and as a result some of the songs were rather weak. Octavarium shifts this focus onto the invidual songs, tightening up the lyrics, doing away with needless instrumentation, and bringing a diversity unseen since IaW. The songs flow better internally, and thus the album flows better as a whole. A new addition is the few seconds of \\"soundscaping\\" between each track that ties them all together, an interesting concept that makes everything flow together despite unrelated subject material. <br /> <br />The new album kicks off with \\"Root of All Evil\\", the continuation of the Alcoholics Anonymous saga begun on SDOIT, and is probably the strongest of the three. It makes an awesome album openener, with an awesome drumline leading into a doubly awesome riff that holds the song together without ever getting old. The song is a real rocker that holds your attention from start to finish, unified and cohesive. Labrie's singing is tighter and better than on any previous album and shows just how much he has improved as a singer. The next two heaviest songs on the album, \\"Panic Attack\\" and \\"Never Enough\\", are both excellent. \\"Panic Attack\\" opens with possibly the catchiest riff on the album, if not in DT's entire discography, and tears into a blazing fast cacophony that perfectly invokes the emotions of its lyrics and title. Once again we find very nice vocal work by Labrie, especially during a little falsetto bit on the bridge that reminds me in all the best ways of Queen. \\"Never Enough\\" is an odd song stylistically for Dream Theater, with some definite Muse influence there, but not a bad thing. <br /> <br />\\"The Answer Lies Within\\" is the album's ballad, a strangely uplifting acoustic song that makes a perfect break after the rockin' intensity of \\"Root of All Evil\\". Rudess and Labrie dominate this one, and it's one of their best soft songs, up there with Silent Man and Disappear (although lyrically and thematically the opposite of the latter). It features some very nice violin work and heartening lyrics such as 'You've got the future on your side'. It transitions into \\"These Walls\\", the catchiest song ever written in a major key, and a huge radio hit if they do it right. Radio hits? An oddity for Dream Theater, but one that reminds me of Images and Words, and that's a good thing. \\"Walls\\" has an awesome chorus and some sweet key harmonies, and despite being an extremely simple song for Dream Theater it is excellent nonetheless. The final of the album's lighter songs is \\"I Walk Beside You\\", a song that could only be a tribute to U2, and just as good as any of the best that they have written. Catchy, poppy, but I love it nonetheless. <br /> <br />But just for those who would complain about Octavarium's not being \\"proggy\\" enough, DT threw in the final two, beastly tracks: \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" and the title track. \\"Sons\\" starts out slow and sad, building up through a heavy instrumental section into an awesomely heartbreaking melody and a haunting orchestrated outtro. It has lyrical ties to \\"In the Name of God\\", featuring themes from 9-11-the title is about partly about the reverence for fanatical suicide in terrorist culture, and partly about the war in Iraq-- and has some of the best vocal and guitar work on the album.  <br /> <br />Finally is the album's beast, \\"Octavarium\\", a track that picks up slowly but surely builds intensity throughout multiple musical landscapes until the chilling ending, a lyrical summary of the album that ties everything together. The lyrics are bit out, the rhythm frantic; this is Dream Theater at their most intense and emotional, and every time James Labrie bites out the words \\"TRAPPED-IN-SIDE-THIS-OC-TA-VAR-I-UM\\" in a half-scream, it sends chills down my spine. The song then closes with a melodic outtro that reminds me of some of the best work Kansas has done. Throughout the song, there are references to classic rock and Dream Theater's own work; the reference to Nightmare Cinema (DT's \\"alter ego\\" band from the FII era) was especially subtle and amusing. Dream Theater fans have asked since 1995 if they could manage an epic that would compare to Change of Seasons. They have, and while Octavarium is a different song, it is just as surely a prog masterpiece. <br /> <br />Is it Images and Words? Musically, no- it reflects every stage of Dream Theater's evolution since then. But it features everything that made IaW an amazing album: great songwriting, varied music, technical ability, melodic playing ranging from beautiful to haunting to rocking-and blends in everything Dream Theater has learned since then. It is easily one of their best albums, and a classic for the ages.  <br />
B0007GADZO|2.0|&lt;Yawn> That's how I reacted to this CD when it stopped playing and I realized I hadn't even noticed. Not the kind of reaction I expected from a Steve Vai release, even after some of the sketchiness of the past decade's works.<br /><br />I'm reminded of a conversation I had with a college friend years ago about the band Triumph. Both huge fans, we disagreed whether a certain album was weak or solid. I said any true fan of Triumph would love all their work, and that any perceived weakness was a result of the listener's prejudices built from previous albums. He said that weak material was weak material regardless of what we expected based on prior work, and that this album was weak. We never saw eye-to-eye on this perspective until now. So wherever you are, Teddy Brosius, I owe you an apology: \\"Never Surrender\\" was a weak album, and so is Steve Vai's \\"Real Illusions: Reflections.\\"<br /><br />I don't think it's that Vai can do better or worse, I think it's that he's spent too much time exploring a pseudo-mystical path for spirituality to remember why he picked up his guitar in the first place. I realize the guy has been married a while now, and his kids are growing up, but the stuff coming out of his imagination now is pedantic, even banal, hardly inspirational and free-wheeling. There are a few bright spots on this recording, but they're just spots, not songs I want to play again. Certainly nothing to make me reach for my guitar and ask, \\"How does he do that?\\" or \\"What's he doing there?\\" Vai used to inspire me to explore theory and my soul at the same time; now he rehashes the same material on every release and leaves me cold.<br /><br />How can the other reviewers listen to the span of this guy's work and not recognize the rut he's dug for himself since the mid-90s? Sure, P&W was a seminal work, but subsequent releases had great stuff, too. The last few, however, have been disappointing, forcing me to dust off the older works for a taste of the writing and playing that made me a Vai fan for nearly 20 years, even thru such empty works as RI:R. He used to produce music that grabbed me on multiple levels, but if I hear that quarter-tone sitar (trash) on one more recording, I'm going to burn my Ibanez in effigy. There's just nothing here of substance, not even a little to reinforce my decision to take a chance on this guy one more time when the last few releases were so disappointing. This may be my last purchase from Steve Vai, which is really hard to write about someone who greatly inspired me to pick up a guitar and see what could happen. Maybe it's time I sent him some of my own work and see whether I can remind him that music can be fun and powerful, not so cerebral and empty.<br /><br />With this release I'm forced to admit that I haven't been a fan of Steve Vai's work since the mid-90s. It's just been too disappointing to keep hoping for all these years that he might get back to his roots and the core of why we play in the first place. I don't deny that he's a great musician, but with this recording I do deny that I'm a fan of his recent work. And it's hard to believe he could have lost his spark, but this release is the latest in a string of pointless recordings that prove that, in fact, Steve Vai no longer shares the fire of his passions with us, the people who have supported him for so long.<br /><br />But I don't expect that to influence any of you any more than I was influenced 15 years ago by a college friend who recognized that you can be a fan without slavishly praising every little thing an artist produces. In fact, it really does take more to separate the strong from the weak and still be satisfied that what's left is enough to still be a fan. Thanks, Teddy, for teaching me a lesson that took me 15 years to truly learn. And thanks, Mr. Vai, for helping me understand that I'm still your fan, I'm just not a fan of your creative ideas since you started digging into Eastern spirituality. Maybe you should come spend some time on my farm in upstate NY and get your hands dirty. Maybe we could find that spark again. Until then, this CD gets shelved indefinitely. What a shame.me spend some time on my farm in upstate NY and get your hands dirty. Maybe we could find that spark again. Until then, this CD gets shelved indefinitely. What a shame.
B00079018K|5.0|I buy music pretty frequently, and it is extremely rare that I ever like an entire album, even less rare if I like it from the first play.  This is by far the best album I've bought in at least 10 years!  From beginning to end it's a masterpiece.  I take it from my home to my car to my office and all the way back home.  I've turned everyone I know onto this album.  It reminds me of Richard Ashcroft singing with UNKLE.  I would highly recommend this album to anyone that was ever a fan of either/both.
B0006L16N8|5.0|First of all, you can easily disregard any score of '1' on amazon. Especially on music CDs on the day of release. These idiots didn't give the CD more than a quick glance...most likely they did nothing more than listen to the 20 second samples. Ignore them, they're clueless. Some people just exist to hate whatever is popular.  <br /> <br />A lot of the earlier reviewers that gave it a 4 or 5 made the statement that it might take you a few listens to appreciate the disc or to even like it. I couldn't disagree more. For the most part it sounded great to me from the very start, including the 2 bonus tracks that were part of another company's special for pre-ordering(the songs are Proof and Things I Don't Understand). 90% of the disc sounded great and unique from the get-go with my favorite being Fix You. The unlisted track, while not the greatest on the disc, is what I would call the disc's worst track and even in saying that it's an excellent song that I've listened to about 10 times already. <br /> <br />Fans of Coldplay have nothing to fear with this new disc. It's more amazing than Rush of Blood to the Head, which itself was amazing. People new to Coldplay can feel safe in knowing they're getting an awesome CD by an amazing band.
B00005R2M3|4.0|By all accounts this is a great English crossover album.Shakira uses her amazing composing and song writing talents.However,I'm not going to be the common ones and say she has this amazing voice because she does not and the songs doesn't really her voice justice.Anyway,the songs in here aree amazing but a couple of flaws here and there. <br /> <br />1.Objection(Tango)-8/10.Her 1st English she's ever wrote and I must say she did a good job.I absolutely love this song,the lyrics and the amazing music.It's a great way to start off the album. <br /> <br />2.Underneath Your Clothes-8.5/10.Another great song.It's passionate and it has a great mystery meaning to it.This song talks about learning more about a person by going underneath what they show.It's a great song,great lyrics. <br /> <br />3.Whenever,Wherever-7/10.Now we all know this one.It's an ok song.She surely knows how to mix different styles of music into one and it turn out great.However,this song shows no vocal talent but i love the lyrics its something what i like to call a \\"Mystery Lyrics\\".Good song and beat is ok <br /> <br />4.Rules-0/10.I hate this song to death.I don't want why she put this song on the album in my opinion this bring the album down.Not a good song and the lyrics is messed up. <br /> <br />5.The One-8/10.I love this song a lot.I like they way she sings on this track and the lyrics is great.LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. <br /> <br />6.Ready For The Good Times-7.5/10.Meaningful lyrics.Not her best in my opinion but ok to listen to,to bring some positivity into your life. <br /> <br />7.Fool-8.5/10.I love this song.I love the lyrics and yet again another Shakira classic. <br /> <br />8.Te Dejo Madrid-2.5/10.Great attempt but i hate it.One of her worst Spanish songs ever. <br /> <br />9.Poem To a Horse-8.5/10.My Favorite on the album.The song speaks for itself.By far this is the song i relate to the most <br /> <br />10.Que Me Quedes Tu-5.5/10.I'm not really this,its a little too slow for me and idon't like the lyrics.Not her best <br /> <br />11.Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)-4.5/10.Not Feeling it.Bad Idea to translation this song.The Spanish version is a lot better. <br /> <br />12.Suerte (Whenever,Wherever)-7.5/10.Nice translation and i like this song in both languages.She did a nice job <br /> <br />13.Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)-6.5/10.OK but English version is a lot better and bad way to end the album <br /> <br />Overral i get this album a B-.It's a great album and i suggest u buy it to feel Shakira in another language. <br />
B0006L16N8|4.0|Is there a word to describe this album or any other by Coldplay. I think there might be one. Moving. This album is a reflection of alot of hard work. The work shows and it pays off. I try to be somewhat objective. I don't want to compare this album to A Rush Of Blood To The Head. It would be impossible to accomplish what they did there. But this is a great follow-up. There is alot of heart here. The sound is not groundbreaking but who wants Coldplay to sound like anything but Coldplay? I am a huge fan and this album is everything I wanted it to be. Highlights include Fix You, Till Kingdom Come and What If. The album starts off \\"vintage\\" Coldplay. And ends on the highest note. I don't give this album five stars because I would like to hear a bit more guitar on this album. But all and all I love Coldplay and I love this album.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is more of a comment than an in-depth review of the album. When I first heard Coldplay, \\"Rush of Cold Blood\\" was already released. Since I've come to love both of their albums (Parachutes and Rush of Cold Blood). It took some time to really enjoy the songs contained, but once I liked them, \\"I was hooked,\\" as they say. Even today, I still give each CD a listen every now and then, so they haven't grown old yet (Aside from songs rehashed on the radio). And now they have released their new CD, \\"X&Y.\\" Just like their first two albums, I can see myself listening to this for quite some time.    If you liked their first two offerings, I see no reason why this wouldn't satisfy that desire for new Coldplay songs. \\"Square One,\\" \\"Fix You,\\" \\"X & Y\\" and \\"A Message\\" are a few of the tracks that I felt the desire to listen to a few more times than the others.    It's the same Coldplay that I've come to know and love (Which might be different for some people, it seems) and even if it does stick to a formula, Coldplay has such a distinct sound that I like to hear, regardless. If they find a formula to make my ears happy, then my money is well spent. Hopefully yours will be, too.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Vile adaptation of the great comic book is not only a misrepresentation of what the comic is actually about but an incoherent adaptation as well. It takes the book's premise and literally steps on it for the sake of milking it for a cheap affect. Keanu Reeves is miscast and his performance is so bad, it's vile.  He has a charm but it does not come across here in this film and he looks like he's making a joke out of his performance. Rachel Weisz does carry this movie on her shoulders by giving it its only good performance but she gets no support from the script and the direction, which is flimsy to say the least. The story is incoherent and the screenplay is a mess. The Special Effects were done better before in other movies and the cinematography is shot way too dark to see some times.  <br /> <br />Worth a look just for Rachel Weisz's better than the film performance but other than her great effort to be better than the horrible script, the rest of the film lacks not only her professionalism but her grace as well <br />
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|i loved it, its one of my favourite movies ever and johnny depp just does the part of cry baby so well.And man is he hot in that movie!
B00008K7AM|5.0|Like \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"The Handmaid's Tale,\\"  \\"The Hot Chick\\" is another insightful cautionary tale warning us of the inevitable fallout created by a capitalist economy.  In this case it's the hollow, narcissistic personalities the system must nurture to sustain its existence.<br /><br />\\"Jessica\\" is an ordinary suburban high school girl who does and buys what she is told to, and like so many teenagers today she experiences an emptiness inside that seems impossible to fill.  She looks to her peers, to boys, to the media, to fashion -- but these are all external things.  This emptiness can only be filled by a father figure, who, due to the demanding nature of today's corporate world, was rarely home during most of her upbringing.  In this sense, Jessica is the feminine counterpart of the feral Victor from Truffaut's \\"L'Enfant Sauvage.\\"  There is no caring Dr. Itard in suburbia, however, and in order to survive this \\"jungle,\\" Jessica must transform into her own protective father figure -- only she has had no proper role model; she can only fashion herself after the most primitive male archetype, brilliantly portrayed by \\"The Animal\\" Schneider.<br /><br />This is the second film in Tom Brady's \\"Animal\\" trilogy, and here he makes clear his desire to make a collection of films that establish a moderate position between the somewhat pessimistic and chaotic vision of Geoffrey Reggio's \\"Qatsi\\" trilogy and the hopeful, synchronistic themes found in Krzysztof Kieslowski's \\"Three Colors\\" films.<br /><br />Learning to overcome shame is one of the main themes of \\"The Hot Chick.\\"  When Jessica cries to her friends \\"It's me!\\" and they only see Schneider, this awakens many a subconscious fear in the audience of rejection due to deficiencies in their own psychological dynamics: whether it be parental dysfunction, sexual confusion, lack of education, poor economic status, or their brother Arnie.  The audience's fear of openly confronting this shame might explain the film's less than stellar performance at the box office, but successful home video run.<br /><br />Many of Jessica's epiphanies in \\"The Hot Chick\\" are similar to those Carl Jung had during his time in Africa, which Brady cleverly alludes to in a cameo by Adam Sandler.  Here Brady uses Sandler to link Jung's idea of a collective unconscious with Wassily Kandinsky's synesthetic theories, which were used heavily in P.T. Anderson's Sandler vehicle, \\"Punch Drunk Love.\\"<br /><br />But where \\"Punch Drunk Love\\" represented Sandler's emotions with abstract sound and imagery, \\"The Hot Chick\\" takes a more direct approach, rejecting Kandinsky's reliance on abstraction and mysticism.  And just to be sure we understand he isn't merely putting a phallus in the O'Keeffe, Brady also cleverly rejects Freudian drive theory in the bathroom urinal sequence.  What's left seems to be an outlook in alliance with Swiss psychologist Alice Miller's -- a belief that conflicts with one's parents must be resolved or else one will remain a prisoner of childhood forever.  (A forewarning about not addressing this issue is dramatically illustrated when we see Jessica's younger brother dancing in front of a mirror, wearing lipstick and a brassiere.)<br /><br />For the most part \\"The Hot Chick\\" succeeds in all of its intentions, and unlike other films in its genre (Terry Gilliam's \\"Brazil\\" for instance) gives the viewer a sense of hope -- and a challenge: Address \\"The Animal\\" inside yourself, and save our world from the dehumanizing corporate machine that exploits our shame and turns us into obedient drones.<br /><br />I also like the part where he falls down the bleachers.e at the box office, but successful home video run.

B0009A1AS2|4.0|After being disappointed in TOT, this is a nice, refreshing welcome back for DT.  Well thought out songs; a little bit of everything that makes a dream theater fan love them.  Really no complaints on any of the songs like some reviewers before me, especially those commenting on how terrible song two's lyrics are (Karl Peterson, who obviously has nothing better to do than to write negative reviews, see his other reviews).  There is nothing wrong with a father wanting to write a song for a child, and i dont think any of us sitting behind our monitors could do any better.  As a dad, I can appreciate this song.  Give the guy a break!  Anyway, i would recommend this album to anyone and everyone who is interested in great musicianship and talent.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I really was anticipating this album.  I'm not sure what went wrong, but this is not the album people want to hear.  It has the same formula, but the lyrics sound generic at times.  It does feel good to hear some new Coldplay though. <br />The opening, \\"Square One\\", is a good track, but things go downhill until \\"Fix You\\".  (I like this track a lot.)  \\"Talk\\" is good listening.  Why does anyone listen to \\"Speed of Sound\\".  That is what record companies want when \\"Clocks\\" does so well.  \\"A Message\\" is a great song.  Can't wait to hear it in concert.  And the bonus joint is the type of venture I was looking for.  I wish 'play would have stuck with Ken Nelson as the producer of the album -- not just three cuts.
B00005NW02|5.0|This is the System album that everyone recognizes. This is what got them to be so popular, and it's obvious why. This is one of the greatest music cds ever made, only to be topped by the two System cds to come after it. This is a must buy for any rock or metal fan, no question. <br /> <br />1. Prison Song - Starts off weird with big guitar riffs, whispering, and complete silence. The song finally gets underway one Serj does one of his deep roars. The chorus really isn't all that great, but it's not bad. The verses are fun and fast, and Daron just makes things even better with his odd little solo that comes in a couple of times in the song. Serj really enjoys changing up his voice over and over again in this song. This is probably the heaviest song on the cd, with all the deep roars throughout. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />2. Needles - Very strange song, with a very strange rhythm. The chorus isn't impressive, but doesn't detract from the song, so it's okay. Daron gets another solo in this song, but it only occurs once, and is longer. It is very, very good though, and is one of the main reasons I enjoy the song so much. 8/10 <br /> <br />3. Deer Dance - The verses are really fun to listen to, and the chorus is great. Great vocals from Serj throughout, and the drummer does really great in this song too with the cymbal. The part where the music completely drops out and it's just Serj and Daron singing quietly in harmony is truly extraordinary. Definately a good song. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Jet Pilot - Although he says the same thing, A LOT, this is still a good song. The verses are especially noticable. The only problem with the song is that there is little to no meaning, and it is far too repetitious. 7/10 <br /> <br />5. X - Fast-paced, but along the same line as Jet Pilot as it repeats itself a lot. Nothing all that great, mainly just filler. 7/10 <br /> <br />6.Chop Suey! - The one System song that almost everyone who listens to the radio recognizes, and for good reason. It starts off nice, but then the first verses from Serj aren't that impressive. Not bad, just not that good. Then, when he starts singing, it sounds really good. The next time he comes to the chorus, he sings for all of it, and it is remarkable. The harmony is great there. The part where he keeps asking why he has been forsaken is amazing, and then the ending, with piano and singing in harmony, was amazing too. The only problem with this song is that it is overplayed, but that's not exactly its fault. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Bounce - A very funny, 'bouncy', and great song. I just can't get enough of it. Sure, it's repetitive, but the repetition is great anyways. Bizarre and strange, but good all the way. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Forest - This is the longest song on the cd besides Aerials. The speed at the start is deceptive, as the chorus is actually pretty slow. Serj sounds great, as always. The part where Serj starts whispering and singing quietly later in the song is really good, as well. 8/10 <br /> <br />9. ATWA - Starts off really slow and pretty, but when the chorus comes in, it packs a punch, as it completely changes the mood set up beforehand. The verses are all slow and melodic, while the chorus is rough and angry. The second time it comes in, they add this awesome yell of \\"Anymore!\\" that is even better. 9/10 <br /> <br />10. Science - Both the verses and the chorus are nice in this song. The middle of the song, where the music totally changes is somewhat mystical and awesome, making this song a definate keeper. 9/10 <br /> <br />11. Shimmy - A song much like Bounce in how it repeats a lot, but is still enjoyable. The ending is the best part, with 'boy' and 'girl' being yelled out. 9/10 <br /> <br />12. Toxicity - Another popular System song, but I really don't understand why, as it's not that great. It's not bad, but it's not outstanding, either. Anyways, it starts off really nice, and then the guitar kicks in with the drums and cymbals, and then right back to thenice soft stuff. Serj sounds great during the verses, but the chorus never really stuck with me that much. I didn't really like it. The later guitar solo is great, and the ending is really nice too. A decent song, but not one of the best, in my opinion. 8/10 <br /> <br />13. Psycho - Repetitious like Bounce and Shimmy, but not quite as good as them. It's still good, though, but there's nothing too special about it. It has a really long outro, which is kinda nice. 8/10 <br /> <br />14. Aerials - The last really popular song on the album, and I can yet again understand why. This is a really slow song, but still one of the best. Serj puts a lot of emotion into his voice in this one. There's lots of harmony, which sounds great. Great guitar riffs, and a great chorus too. Nice ending, as well. 10/10 <br /> <br />15. Arto - The secret song after Aerials, which some seem to think is part of it, but it's not. It's tribal sounding, and there's no actual singing, other that some more kind of tribal stuff. It sounds really cool, though. A great way to end an extraordinary album. 10/10
B0009A1AS2|5.0|picked it up the day it came out and it is a solid release by the band.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has come along way since their 2000 release \\"Parachutes\\", and has brought alot of fans with them along the way. X&Y, a very anticipated album, is finally here, and well, it's as good as we all had hoped. The CD as a whole delievers the only way Coldplay knows how to brilliantly deliever, but no songs on this album are quite as good as \\"The Scientist\\", in my opinion.    1. Square One 8/10 (solid way to start the CD)  2. What If 9/10 (What If you don't want me in your life?)  3. White Shadows 8.5/10  4. Fix You 9.5/10 ( single potential)  5. Talk 10/10 (next single most likely)  6. X&Y 7.5/10  7. Speed of sound 10/10 (piano reminds you of Clocks, Good choice for 1st single)  8. A Message 8.5/10  9. Low 7/10 (the song I like least on the Album)  10.The Hardest Part 10/10  11.Swallowed in the Sea 10/10 (this song clicked with me, Beautiful lyrics)  12.Twisted Logic 9/10  *(13) Till Kingdom Come 10/10 (solid Bonus track,I heard it from their acoustic sessions a while back, love playing it on the guitar)    I personally did not like X&Y as well as R.O.B.T.T.H, but  a great follow up as to be expected. These guys are unbelievable live, DO NOT miss Storytellers feat. Coldplay  on VH1 Wednesday night, June 8th at 10pm Eastern.  xxcheersxx
B00005IC2H|5.0|There are two types of reviews for any Sigur Ros album: <br /> <br />1.)  \\"This album sucks.  It's all gay and stuff.  The guy doesn't even speak English!  Where's the Skynnyrd?\\" <br /> <br />2.)  \\"This album will change your life.  It is the greatest piece of music ever created by human beings.  It may, in fact, have been created by otherworldly beings.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Honestly?  It's a neat album.  They're a neat band.  I say that mostly because there's really nothing like them, at least in the U.S.  I don't know that Sigur Ros is going to give you the answers to the meaning of life, but it's soothing music.  It's the kind of thing an alt-rock fan might want to listen to if he feels like doing meditation -- i.e., your average John Tesh fan probably isn't going to dig on Sigur Ros. <br /> <br />I think this is a great album.  I really enjoy it.  Will you?  Eh, you'll probably want to find some sound clips first.  Amazon has a few free mp3 downloads, give those a listen and see what you think.  It's certainly not for everybody.  But it's for some of us, and some of us think it's pretty neat.
B000002VQQ|5.0|My first concert EVER was Patti Smith at the Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut, just after she released Horses, and man could she put a voice to the disenfranchised artists, youth and social outcasts of the day.  This album packs all the intensity and poetic release of that live performance, and there's so much here!  If you don't dig poetry don't go here!  If you can't handle introspection and nestling the bleeding heart of a tormented artist in your hands... flee.   <br /> <br />But if the release of raw rock and roll angst is what you need, then crank this one so you feel it in your bones... <br /> <br />Yeah... they say she's one of the founders of the punk movement, one of the 100 or so most influential women of rock, she is definitely those things, but in Horses she's more like Dylan's seriously revved up poetess-apprentice.  This is really her first volume of poetry, offered in a mixed bag of styles-du-jour from piano-backed spoken word to savage rock 'n roll to pseudo-reggae.  <br /> <br />Amazing mastery of rock as poetry, this album showcases Patti's delivery best among her releases, and is a milestone recording for that reason alone, since Patti was truly a pioneer at the time this was produced.  Don't miss the B-side \\"My Generation\\", which she performed as an encore in her live show (and had the feel of a punk anthem at the time) and takes a deserved place on this CD
B0006L16N8|5.0|I had my doubts at first... I first listened to the album all the way through last Tuesday on mtv.com's 'Leak' feature. Up until that point the only track I had (mistakenly) listened to was the opening section of \\"Fix You\\", heard on an episode of The OC. <br /> <br />With a fresh mind and a dire thirst for some new Coldplay, i endulged in X&Y. Let me say that as i sit here now and listen to it for the second time all the way through, I am completely mezmorized. Martin's voice continues to be a hook for anyone who has fallen in love with Coldplay, and anyone who has ever dared to give them a listen. He does need to work on the lyrics at times, but the music ultimately ends up over-powering (i couldnt think of a better word) any doubt that you are listening to an amazing album by one of the greatest bands of all time.  <br /> <br />Tracks worth noting are the opening \\"Square One\\" which is quite a trip as you listen to it, especially its climatic chorus, if that makes sense... the track that follows, \\"What if\\" is amazing, but almost seems to be in the wrong place; the second track and already the mellow out? You forget about it when Champion comes in anyway... Slowly becoming my all-time favorite Coldplay song, and the hands-down greatest track on X&Y is \\"Fix You.\\" No words describe the feeling when Jonny comes in with his riff and Champion lets the percussion loose; all the makings of a fantastic set closer. I am a fan of \\"Talk\\", but the CD shines again with it's first single \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Low.\\" \\"Speed of Sound\\" does sound a little to similar to \\"Clocks\\", but again, by the time you accept this, you're already caught up in the beauty of the song. \\"Twisted Logic\\" is an ok finish to the album; I agree with it being a semi-Radiohead ripoff. \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" is a good listen, different, but definitly a good track. <br /> <br />Pick up this album immediately.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm sure people here have already said it all, but I wanted to add my voice to the chorus.  Firefly is a touching, funny, amazingly intelligent show with incredible, well-played characters.  Fox should publicly apologize for taking it off the air and BEG Joss Whedon and the cast/crew to come back.  I'm waiting with bated breath for the movie. <br /> <br />P.S.  Buy this dvd set if you haven't already!
0385720920|3.0|`Choke' is about Victor Mancini, who pretends to choke to gain people's attention and love. He is a sex addict, a medical school dropout, earning a meager amount. He chokes on food so that someone can save him. The person who saves his life starts feeling responsible for Victor's life and starts sending him money. Victor does this to earn enough to keep his insane Mom in a hospital.    Victor's character is not well developed and so are the others. There is just one dimension to the characters - their limitations. Chuck's writing style comes as a fresh breeze - very different! He has an amazing writing style which might be a little difficult to get used to.     There is a first person narration by Victor Mancini which is in the present tense and a third person narration which talks about Victor's life when he was a boy. Victor's mom is an eccentric and is in jail half the time. Victor has a very close friend who is addicted to collecting rocks and he is also a sex addict. The book becomes dirty at times when talking about sex. It becomes gross when the hospital scenes are described.     After finishing the book, I was wondering what the book was all about.    Weird is not the right word, but that's the first thing that comes to mind.    If you don't want to experiment with a different writing style or a different theme, do NOT try this book.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|The thing I like about DT is that they always change from disc to disc AND they always produce a Quality CD.  Not many, if any, bands of today are able to accomplish this.  And, whenever I see a \\"bad\\" review for a DT album it is because someone does not perfer the change in style from one disc to the next.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I prefer to have 8 discs that are all different yet all acheive high qaulity and actually stay in my disc player for longer than a day.  Back to Octavarium - My prefered DT style is heavy, in the vein of TOT but I enjoy the melodic songs as these tend to be the ones I grab a hold of with time.  Octavarium shows both of these styles and presents us with some \\"more accessible\\" songs (The Answer Lies Within, These Walls and I Walk Beside You).  So I guess you could call this the most diverse disc to date.  If you like heavy, The Root of All Evil, Panic Attack and Never Enough should be your cup of tea.  If you like melodic (more progressive rock style) then Sacrificed Sons and Octavarium are two of the best epics DT has done.  And if you have a problem with long instrumentals and need more \\"easily disgestible songs\\" give the aforementioned The Answer Lies Within, These Walls and I Walk Beside You a spin.  I personally will have this disc in my player for a long time and hope to use it to convert others to one of the few Quality bands around.
B000002P2W|5.0|Following their 1973 double-album rock opera, \\"Quadrophenia,\\" The Who took a simpler, more down-to-earth approach for their 1975 release, \\"The Who By Numbers.\\" Often referred to as the Who's \\"quietest\\" album (though that IS an exaggeration), \\"Who By Numbers\\" still features some awesome Who rockers, but it also has some beautiful, softer tunes, plus some very autobiographical lyrics, mostly from guitarist Pete Townshend. It's the Who's most introspective album, and it's a great album, too. All of the songs are outstanding, such as the shuffling piano rock of \\"Slip Kid,\\" the banjo fun of the hit single \\"Squeeze Box,\\" bassist John Entwistle's rock star tale of \\"Success Story,\\" and the powerful \\"Dreaming From The Waist\\" and \\"In A Hand Or A Face.\\" Townshend brilliantly discusses his problems with the bottle in \\"However Much I Booze,\\" and he also delivers one of the most beautiful songs of his entire career, \\"Blue Red And Grey,\\" with just his voice & ukelele, and french horn accompanyment by Entwistle. Great performances all around by Townshend, Entwistle, singer Roger Daltrey and drummer Keith Moon. It may not be as highly touted as \\"Tommy,\\" \\"Who's Next\\" or \\"Quadrophenia,\\" but \\"The Who By Numbers\\" is, nevertheless, a very special Who album.
0385510454|3.0|It took less than six hours to finish the book. I don't know if it was due to the fact that the story had such a simplistic plot line -- not to mention some repetitive content, i.e. the main character expressing his gratitude with a dash of cynicism thrown in for flavor -- or if it I pressed onward, fueled by the desire to finally get to the really suspenseful part, which never seemed to fully materialize.<br /><br />The Broker is not the literary storm its advertising tries to make it. It was a great way to pass an afternoon, and though I am a fan of Mr. Grisham's work, I kept wondering when he was going to pick up the pace and start rocking the creative boat a bit. Sadly, the story arrived at its conlusion with all the ferocity and ferver of a tepid summer breeze rather than tempest.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|So I sit here at my computer, somewhat bewildered and confused as to why all of these naysayers don't like Mariah's new effort, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\". One wished she would've sang We Belong Together ten years ago because it would've sounded better. I agree with \\"Mimi\\" and the majority of hearing humans that her voice is unbelievable and amazing, and it's probably at the best point of her career. I bought this CD on a step of faith. I've never been a big Mariah fan, I knew some of the random songs. But something just told me to buy it when it came out. I'm so glad that I did. <br /> <br />Mariah kicks it off with \\"It's Like That\\", which is hot, but has an even hotter remix (too bad it didn't make it on the final cut of the CD). \\"We Belong Together\\" follows up, and anyone with an FM radio has surely heard this piece. My only complaint is that it's so short - I want more! \\"Shake it Off\\" follows, and it took awhile for that song to grow on me, but it has now and it's one of my favorites. Aaaah...the soulful \\"Mine Again\\" is next, and it will entrance you into the song, you'll find yourself hypnotized by her vocals and the background music. \\"Say Somethin\\" is a HOT track with the Neptunes and Snoop doing they thing. There have been rumors that this will be the next single. One of my personal favorites from the beginning is \\"Stay the Night\\" the ubiquitous Kanye West-produced mid-tempo joint. You will be left nothing short of blown away by the vocals, and of course, Kanye does his thing and the song is ill.  <br /> <br />\\"Get Your Number\\" is aight, I like it but it's not one of my favorites. \\"One and Only\\" is straight up dope with Twista and Mariah like a grip on a tire. Probably my second favorite is \\"Circles\\" which will have your jaw aching from the drop it will take when you hear Mimi's vocals towards the end. \\"Your Girl\\" really showcases Mariah's upper range and it's a pretty decent song. I'm also not a big fan of \\"To the Floor\\", but it's still aight. \\"Joy Ride\\" isa slick ballad, I really like it alot. My favorite song is the gospel \\"Fly Like A Bird\\". I have WORN this song out on my iTunes. The message is great, the vocals are amazing, the production is slick, the choir is inspiring....just an awesome song and a nice way to end probably the best CD of 2005. It's been almost two months since it's been released, and the CD is looking at yet another week in the top 2 or 3 on the charts. That should tell you something. Pick up this CD, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />These are my favorite songs in order of my liking... <br /> <br />1) Fly Like A Bird <br />2) Circles <br />3) Stay the Night <br />4) We Belong Together <br />5) Mine Again <br />6) One and Only <br />7) Say Somethin <br />8) Your Girl <br />9) Shake it Off <br />10) It's Like That <br />11) I Wish You Knew <br />12) Joy Ride <br />13) Get Your Number <br />14) To the Floor
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I just loved this movie for it invoked romance and sexual tension that I haven't seen in a movie in years.  Gerard Butler (he looks like he stepped off the cover of a romance novel) has got to be the sexiest man alive. The reason I subtract one star is because no woman on earth would dare have us believe she would choose Raoul over the Phantom.  I almost died when I saw the \\"Point of No Return.\\"  I think they had to hose down the set after that smoldering scene.  It is just hard to believe that Christine would leave the Phantom for a man who has the sex appeal of a tree.  But then I again, I suppose it's a movie, and the fairytale would not be acceptable if she ended up with the supposedly \\"deformed\\" man.   <br /> <br />The music is full of emotion, and I enjoyed the singing performances more than the Brightman/Crawford duo.  I think Emmy Rossum has a more pure and distinct voice than Brightman. Butler has the tragic tension (and loads of testosterone) that Crawford didn't quite convey to me.  I've seen the production on stage, and the movie is so much better.  You also don't have to pay $100 each time you watch it.  The sets are beautiful, and you can fast forward all the parts with Raoul singing to her in his feminine voice how he's going to protect her - PAH-LEESE!!.  He was so annoying.  Patrick Wilson (Raoul) is a talented singer, but he emerges with poor acting skills for a movie production, and we never feel the attraction between himself and Christine.  It's almost like she's with him because he has money and a title and she's a giddy teenager eager for the good life.  <br /> <br />As a side note, I've read the original novel from 1911, and it is one of the most romantic and emotional books.  I think Webber really tried to bring that raw emotion into his musical.   I just wish that Christine would end up with the Phantom and Raoul would end up with a bad hair day, can we have an alternate ending Mr. Webber, PLEASE??!!!   <br />
B00080Z53O|5.0|Wow! And WOW again! This should be a must-see movie for everyone interested in the topic of living and dying.  I've read the book (Cartas desde el Infierno)which inspired the director to make the movie. I like to movie a lot more, it's self explanatory and I found it easier to understand Ramon's ordeal.  What a difficult mission and what a legacy he left behind.  Hopefully more people will start understanding that death is not the enemy. I also recommend the movie  Tusdays with Morrie.   Two great movies from caring individuals who even after their death continue their teachings.  As Morrie said, when we learn to die, we'll learn how to live.
B0006L16N8|2.0|\\"Fix You\\" is genuinely marvellous, but what happened to the rest of the album? To me, X&Y is a kind of slushy, over-produced, mass market slice of overly sweet cake. Coldplay have mastered the ability to make their music popular to absolutely everyone and in the process watered it down to the extent that it misses the ingredients that could make it truly great. Very disappointing. Download it before buying.
B0000AOV85|2.0|Caution! This album sucks big time. Not a single intact musical piece on the whole disc.  Only chit chat and boring interviews. All the previous positive reviews are misleading. If your are more interested in Pink's music, this DVD is NOT for you. And it's definitely not worth the high price.  What a rip off!!

B0006L16N8|5.0|There's no two ways about it, Coldplay has outdone themselves.  \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is one of my all-time favorite albums, yet \\"X & Y\\" goes above and beyond that album.  Delivering something that is as perfect as it can get.  Each song adds clarity and unassumed depth to the album.  I had high expectations for this album, and while I knew they would be met, I didn't know they'd be exceeded.  \\"X & Y\\" is one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Whether you like Coldplay or not is inconsequential, what is imperative is that you go buy this album.  Nothing released this year will be able to hold a candle to it.
B000654Z2I|5.0|An Album so seemingly ahead of it's time, that its difficult to define it amongst today's contemporary music. Devised in the early 70's it's largely electronic infused rock, spliced with early forms of synthesizers, it's as much avant garde as it is Rock & roll. Japanese singer Kenji \\"Damo\\" Suzuki is a unusual singer frontman, in that his vocal strain involves as much quiet murmuring as it is loud shrieking (almost all of it unintelligible), yet coupled with the quite literally (and I'm not overstating this) Visionary arrangements & instrumentation, it manages to become one of the most significant albums ever released in the 70's. And thereby touching upon `Electronic Rock', Dark Ambient, Art Rock, psychedelic Funk, or swamped in a truly captivating consistency, that even 30 or so years on, it manages to shoot straight in and become easily one of the finest albums I've heard this year (and will easily remain in the top 5, before the years out). Although caution is advised with this album, as it's resolutely leftfield & non-conformist, and for every 5 people that it hypnotises with it's brilliance, there'll be someone that's convinced it's utter `pretension', If you regularly listen to albums that push boundaries & are too challenging for mainstream or your friends just don't get....then buy this, It really highlights how utterly incredible music doesn't always find a larger audience.
B0000029GA|5.0|When Illmatic dropped in 1994 no one was expecting this Kid named Nas to make the kind of impact he made. This album is considered by many critics to be the greatest rap album ever.  <br /> <br />Clearly the album's only weakness is its brevity. At 10 tracks including the intro, which is not a song, it is about the length of a demo. But what would you want 20 tracks of trash or nine incredibly brilliant songs? That is what this album offers. DJ Premier did most of the beats and the job he did was nothing short of outstanding while NAS's lyrics were on point speaking like a sagacious street poet.  <br /> <br />In 1994, a time when gangsta rap was in vogue, this album changed people's perspectives on what rap can accomplish. It opened people's eyes that it doesn't have to be a non stop barrage of machismo belligerent lyrics. It showed fans and artists alike that you can take this music to a deeper level.  <br /> <br />Illmatic has definitely left an indellible mark on hiphop. This is Nas's masterpiece and if you only own one Nas album this should be the one because let's face it everything Nas did after Illmatic was a let down.
B000002L99|5.0|I was 18 years old when this album came out. I can still remember being a little nervous about hearing it for the first time. Van Halen had been at the top of the throne of rock and roll till Roth left the fold in search of bigger and better things (boy, did he make the wrong move!!!!). Then came the breaking news via MTV News that the Red Rocker Sammy Hagar was to join Van Halen and recording for the new album had already begun. Well, to be honest, I wasen't sure what to expect till, I heard the album. MAN what a strong album. From the opener, \\"Good Enough\\" to the last drop, \\"Inside\\", the album does more than it's fair share of delivering good ol sunny California, fun in the sun Van Halen style rock and roll. Every, and I mean EVERY track is solid from start to finish. Highlights include the hits, Why Can't This Be Love\\", Love Walks In (which my wife and I refer to as our song...) Dreams and Best of Both Worlds as well as other album faves like 5150, Good Enough and the excellent, perhaps best rocker on the album, Summer Nights. <br /> <br />So...for those of you that are not familiar with 5150, and you are thinking of checking it out, I can only hope that my review can help make your final decision. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|When I bought this movie I actually thought it was an average no special movie about drug addiction.  But when I watched it I was drawn into this movie.  So freaking depressing and heartbreaking, it was unbelievable.  Yet at the sametime it was so hard to look away, so into it, I would kill myself if I didn't finish it.  A story of 4 people getting screwed over and addicted by drugs, their lives slowly turn to trash throuought the movie.  Beautiful music, amazing acting and directing; It is a \\"must see\\" movie to many.  It will literally make you cry. <br /> <br /> <br />This is the definition of a movie...This is the definition of a Masterpiece.
0440419514|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Pullman's work, and as such, it saddens me that so many of the reviews on this page find themselves overly preoccupied with Pullman's stance on religion, because this book is not entirely - or even in the main - about religion. Certainly religion plays a large role in these books, but they are not anti-christian as many claim. They do criticize some aspects of dogma, but they do not criticize a belief in any kind of god or gods. In fact, they are not even really about the death of god as many claim - if you examine the story more closely, you will see that what many people view as the true god - that is the Creator, the loving and forgiving god, as opposed to the Destroyer - is actually strengthened within the course of these books. When it comes down, you don't have to be Christian, Buddhist, Atheist, Agnostic, Jewish, or of any specific denomination/belief to enjoy these books - you just have to have an open mind. <br /> <br />That having been said, while I didn't think any parts of the books were really inappropriate for children, I do think that plenty of it would go straight over plenty of childrens' heads! Obviously there are some references placed into the book specifically for older readers, but I still think that it would be difficult for a young mind to fully grasp the scientific and philosophical implications of this work. That's what this book is really about - it's about consciousness, kindness, adolescence, love (not in the romantic sense, necessarily), and acceptance. Really, the true measure of what the book is \\"about\\" morally is to look at which values it praises, and which it criticizes (as Pullman himself has argued). It praises bravery, selflessness, love, and acceptance while criticizing close-mindedness, oppression, and hate. Who can say that that's immoral?
B00003CXCT|5.0|I think anyone will enjoy this DVD...well, if your not a Star Wars fan, maybe you won't. Other reviews here tell you of the changes they had. The Greedo scene is still in this, which I began disliking like a year ago, but it's not a big deal. It's not like your whole vision of Han Solo was altered, because anyway, we each take characters in however we want to. Hayden was added to the end scene as part of the Jedi Trinity, as I call it: Anakin, Yoda, and Obi Wan, to forever take care of Luke and watch over him as he reforms the Jedi Order and the peace in the Republic. I gotta say, adding Hayden was a huge thing for me, because now that scene is much more emotional in my point of view, specially after experiencing episode 3. These are awesome films, and you still can see that here. Many people believe Lucas should stop adding stuff and respect the public that \\"made\\" him, but I don't believe that. They are his films, and as the author he can do whatever he wants. In a book is much simpler and understandable, but in a movie it is tricky business, but the excitement of seeing Star Wars will never be changed. When the whole saga on DVD comes out this will be obsolete, but a fan with a job will not hesitate on experiencing all the features and such this offers.
0143034901|5.0|This book is simply amazing. Book lovers will adore it. And I'm positive that will become a classic as the years go by... although in Spain it has already become.<br /><br />Native from Barcelona (where the story takes place) I can assure you that descriptions are very accurate... you can feel it... sense it... smell it... the city and it's life comes out of its pages. Although the story is set some years away from now... many things my grandparents told me come to life while I go through the pages... and many things still remain the same.<br /><br />But having seen Barcelona is not a requisite to enjoy this new jewel. The story has everything: mistery, adventure, intrigue, love, friendship, passion and hatred. Sensations in it are so strong that wont leave you untouched. Deep, and full of truths that can be applied to our life, will make you think, and at the same time, spend an amusing time.<br /><br />You won't regret opening this book... You'll be delighted and trully touched (at least I was). Hope seeing you soon as we walk through the misteries of Zafon's imagination *
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Absolutely BRILLIANT.  I had heard from my brother, my friends, and coworkers who had all seen the show during its undeservedly short and mangled stint on television that it was phenomenal and incredibly enjoyable.  I took them at their word, but just never watched it.  Time went on and it came out on DVD.  With a passive \\"Oh, I'll have to get that some day,\\" I brushed it off.  Finally, my good friend told me I NEEDED to watch it.  To convince me of this he showed me the trailer for the film due out September 30th this year (2005).  The trailer alone hooked me and I had to know what was going on. <br /> <br />I went out and bought the DVD set (which took MUCH hunting; suddenly they are nowhere to be found) and I watched it... and then I watched it again (showing other people who had never seen it)... and then I watched it all with audio commentary.  I am now an ENTHUSIASTIC Firefly fan.  I only hope and pray that the movie in September will continue to convert others and rekindle interest in the show, thusly opening the door for Joss Whedon to continue and COMPLETE his ingenius vision. <br /> <br />And, for the skeptical out there, my wife is \\"not into\\" Star Wars at all.  But she loves - L-O-V-E-S - Firefly.  Please, rent, borrow, buy, STEAL (well... don't steal, but go ahead with the other options) this set and just give it a chance.  If after watching the Pilot and The Train Job you don't crave to see more (or even think the show is relatively worth while) then you're probably dead or Amish.  You WILL love this show more than you'll ever guess or imagine.  And I'm not even using my Jedi Mind Trick on you either.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's latest cd is simply beautiful. They have taken one huge step in the right direction.  A lot more piano, a little less bass, and more exciting music.  I have read other reviews saying that this is more mellow and more boring, and I have no idea where they are getting that from.  This cd is awesome!  All coldplay fans will not regret.  My favorite tracks are Speed of Sound,White Shadows, the Hardest Part, and A Message.  This is definitely a new sound.  What it seems to do is make me want to listen to their first cds more, and while listening to Clocks midway through AROBTTH I want to listen to X&Y all over again.  Excellent job Coldplay!
B00097A5HW|5.0|This is an amazing and beautiful album. This is by far, Shakira's most mature work. The album has very diverse type of songs. There is La Tortura with reggaeton influences, the bossonova tune Obtener Un Si, the electronic La Pared with a beautiful acoustic version included as well, and the alt-rock song La Imprescindible. This album shows off Shakira's love of mixing styles to come up with unique songs all her own. As always, Shakira's beautiful and unusual lyrics can be found throughout the CD. I would highly reccomend this album for fans of Shakira's other works and for music fans in general.
B00005AQF7|5.0|I'm completely into gangsta rap, i listen to the late 80s early 90s music, i have heard all of 2pac's(my favorite rapper), snoop doggs, dre's albums and other rappers like the doc, ice cube, nwa, comptons most wanted and above the law, As good as they all are as 2pac being the best rapper of all time, he has never made an album that can really compete with Doggystyle, no one has, this album is a classic top to bottom and i can't imagine any real gangsta rap fan hatin it. <br />Doggystyle is way better than any of the new s**t, 50 cent, g-unit and those other wankstas can suck it cause they have no talent compared to snoop let alone comparing themselves to people like 2pac, biggie, rakim, run dmc or the D.O.C., they're ruining rap and because of them it may soon die out, you need to hear this album and see what you're missing out on. <br />Some people complain about how snoop has bad vocals, has no talent and aint no gangsta because we wears pigtails and calls himself snoop dogg, i believe that he i one of the best in history, making his debut at 18 on DR DRE'S album, now dre is the finest producer that rap has to offer, he could not have made a bad decision on what rapper he thought could have made it, thus the success of eminem, snoop and would have been the D.O.C. had it been for that car accident. <br />Back to the album, and apart from the first two skits or g-funk intro or whatever, the songs are great, classic enjoyable, from gin and juice to pump pump, i rate them all 5 star because they all have great qualities, my favorite songs being Gin & Juice, Lodi Dodi, Murder Was The Case, Serial Killa and Ain't No Fun(best snoop song ever), they all show the best of the early 90s era and he could not be competed with. <br />No one can say that the beats suck because dr dre produced the whole album, enough said. If you think dre is a bad producer you need to lay off rap and listen to that rock s**t because you aint gonna find any better. <br />This album is a classicand should be appreciated by every rap fan out there, if you think there is anything wrong with it then maybe you dont like rap cause i cant believe anyone would say Doggystyle is a bad album.

B00003CX5P|2.0|I don't know what George is thinking. If this was his plan, he should have quit with Return of the Jedi. The story is weak and the acting incredibly poor. No amount of special effects can replace a good story and chemistry between actors. Give it up George, as a writer, you suck. As a digital artist, you are a genius.

B000002HAJ|4.0|To review the Cure is like judging art- tastes change and fads come and go and through it all is the sound of Robert Smith. Many Cure fans disregard this release as commercial and for many the thought of this CD faded just as soon as \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" fell from MTV rotation. (Please note that there was a time when Music Television played what were called \\"music videos\\") Cure fans should revisit \\"Wish\\" often and enjoy the fine music it has to offer. Open, High, Apart, From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea, Doing the Unstuck, Friday I'm in Love, A Letter to Elise, and End stack up with the best of the Cure's work and make \\"Wish\\" one of their best pieces of art.

B00005AQF7|3.0|I paticularly could have waited a little while longer for a better attempt at a better album but, i guess when your starving for new talent you will except anything. WITH the death of N.W.A. and the emergence of ice cube you have to want something to compare to cube which nothing dosen't but you gladly except anything new, with that said honestly there aren't many tracks on this album that make me say ugh! compared to cube all we really hear is snoop laced over dre beats. IF you really want a decent album snatch that greatest hits album and you'd really be satisfied. <br />
B000099T2L|5.0|This album was great. Live at Wembley was even greater. Beyonce's talent and style is unbelievable. I can't explain, you just have to buy it.

B0000024W3|5.0|Bob Dylan, a songwriter and trolly humpin' good country artist! If you are any kind of \\"FAN\\" of Bob's, you should really like this one. Great country from an artist not yet out of his prime and infact still awaiting the true mercurial God-personified-who all the golden children whished and hoped for. <br /> <br />I believe that people will debate every Beatles, Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan(Huh, they all start with B's...hm...well isn't that funny, hm) for every chatroom and blog on the entirety of the internet. Forever. <br />Yet what is most profound about this one is, well, Why? Well, I'll give you my best answer as some kind of musicologist. His Family! You Blockheads! His Family! You see, Rob Zimmerman was getting hounded by the worst of the late 60's flower babies every day in woodstock, and whereever else he went with his wife. Prophets, and the most ambiguous psuedo-philosophes any circus owner could find at the time were reading his address on bathroom walls and making exodus for his house where he was trying to raise his child. That would annoy anyone to the point of moving, and sadly in the end, divorce. Even his old girlfriend from way back in Greenwich village, New York; Joan Baez was calling him out in songs to come take hold of the whole generation-revolution-movement. <br />Bob Dylan didn't want any of that for he had kids, a wife, and he had come from traditional roots of Minnesota and the 50's. Where his loyalty lay was with family. Bob even points to this in his new book Chronicles: \\"I was determined to put myself beyond the reach of it all. I was a family man now, didn't want to be in that group portrait.\\" <br /> <br />It can be argued that the last words about \\"group portrait\\" reflect upon his Self Portrait album. Rather than him wanting to be part of that \\"portrait\\"(view, focus) of people(society, golden children),  he wanted the portrait, or his life, to belong to him, and he belonged to his family. Dylan has always summed himself up as not belonging to those \\"people\\", that, while he is modest, one belongs to oneself. In my own opinion, he saw some deep ignorance in these people. I bet he saw that the apple does not fall far from the tree, and those \\"evil\\" congressmen and \\"The Man\\" were only hereditary to all the flower babies. I think he just wanted to write songs for the heck of it, yet occasionally that entails writing for the hero. <br /> <br />It's for sure, though, that this album served its purpose better than, maybe, a twist of style. Nashville skyline was to truly diverge from those \\"out of this world\\" poem-songs and all that electronic heroism. Yet some still were looking for that shadowy and mysterious Dylan train come with gold and sapphire for the truly faithful in the \\"Bob Dylan regime\\". <br />Self Portrait made it seem like he just didn't have it anymore for those stand up and refuse yourself songs. It sure is sweet country, though! Not NEARLY as good as Nashville Skyline which you should also buy. I mean, just listen to that album, and then to some of that Rolling Thunder Revue, Man! <br />Which leads me to another point: that Dylan actually lived this great figure through in 74 and 75. He actually connected with his audience again, and really raised the call before his beautiful voice started to go in the eighties. <br />Tangled Up In Blue was a song for those hippies who had been to high to really live fully in the 60's. Idiot wind was another personal where he castigates ignorant fans, like \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", although that was more of a screw-all of-you-who-now-live-poor-and-dumb kind of a thing. On the rolling Thunder ReVUE he sounds as though he's not only breaking up inside with his problems with his wife, but he is apoligizing for leaving everyone in the hippi dust way back. Somewhere in the packet of that set, on the liner notes, Alan Ginsberg says something about Dylan really personifying the real, Great american idol(not literal translation). Alan also hints at how he sounds like he is calling back to the 60's, and finally taking everyone up for the final \\"Come with me, tell your friends, it's anarchy in the U.S.\\" <br />Of course it could have just been the wild translucent energy that gravitated throughout the revue that makes that version of \\"Tonight, I'll Be Staying Here with You\\" so enthralling. <br /> <br />This album, Self Portrait, recieves five stars. Because it is an essential original. Not only is it the greatest, most influential, and infamous \\"Get Away From Me\\" recording ever made, but it also actually deterred millions of fans who had until then hung on his every song. The Golden Children actually abandoned their greatest prophet at the most crucial time because of a mediocre album. This actually means that both the generation, and Bob were abandoned.  <br />This album should not be recognized for its musical mediocrity, but rather for its bonechilling showmanship and what it revealed about the laziest, most ignorant, most selfish, heartless generation ever. I can only imagine that Nixon had a good hardy laugh at Altamont; when the drippy hippies toppled on each other and really gave up their mysticism, youth embellishment, and chemicals. Everyone had to get jobs at health stores and in government(GW). <br /> <br />Finally, I want to say that I am terribly tired of people making fun of Dylan's voice. You are an idiot if you cannot realize the expression in his songs. By far, he can deliver a song better than anyone else. I sing kinda like an opera guy, but I'd really kill for Dylan's voice. You can hear thousand years pain in his voice when he sings. In fact, that may be his hidden charm. For those long poems would mean nothing without that organic, real, human voice of his. The most Beautiful voice ever.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|First of all, let me pre-qualify myself by stating I am a huge fan of DT and Liquid Tension Experiment. I am very familiar with their entire catalog, have numerous full band scores of their work, and have studied both guitar and keyboards at Berklee COM. While I obviously appreciate DT's musical \\"chops\\", it is not what I solely look forward to in their compositions.  <br /> <br />I purchased this CD with great expectations the very morning it was released. Upon listening to it the first time, my first impression of Octavarium was somewhat of a letdown. SFOAM and IAW blew me away upon first listening, I might add. So far, I have listened to Octavarium completely about 6 times and although it has grown on me somewhat, it does not come close to SFOAM in terms or musicality or compositions, even if this is not a \\"concept\\" album, per se.  <br /> <br />On the plus side, the production/recording qualiyu on Octavarium is top notch, but should be expected for a band of this caliber. There is alot of synths/SFX sounds used, so there is qreat low-end/bass on the record, especially when played through a decent sound system with subs. This is not a Petrucci \\"chops\\" album, but considering the \\"shredfest\\" that was on Train Of Thought, and slso the fact that John just released his solo album, perhaps it makes sense for him to take a more \\"backseat\\" role with this DT album. If you want to hear keyboards, this is the album to get, as Jordan clearly is in the driver seat for this album. <br /> <br />Although I've never been a huge fan of Labrie's voice, you don't hear as much \\"operatics\\" from him on this recording. His vocals are more processed with effects giving way to a more experimental and atmospheric sound. <br /> <br />The tracks are all good on Octavarium, don't get me wrong. They just didn't \\"wow\\" me upon first listening. The title track is the standout in my opinion as it showcases DT's many influences (Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Marillion, etc.). Definately worth getting ifyou're a hardcore DT fan, but in my opinion, casual listeners should start with SFOAM or earlier releases (as has been already mentioned in prior reviews) <br />
B0009KQOCO|5.0|This is amazing, one of the best movies ever, and coming to the PSP, I hope they release more classics on PSP!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This album takes a major step foward in terms of explicit and implicit structure.  There are all sorts of allusions that, I think, people are missing out on.  Read up on the liturgy of the octive - pay attention to the signifigance of having seven parts of  \\"one song\\" comprise the begining and the end of the album.   <br /> <br />This is not casual listening.  This is something different from the balls to the wall metal that DT has been known for as of late.  This is music to be analyzed.  This is something to be soak in.  It's not flashy.  It's deeper than that. <br /> <br />My only found fault with the album would have to be the lyrics.  These are not nearly as strong as on other albums.   <br /> <br />However, I believe that most hardcore DT fans will find plenty of things to love about this album.  I know I have.
B0007Y4USW|3.0|Mariah is the most accomplished female artist of our time, there's no disputing that.  I also consider myself a big Mariah fan, but to market her return as \\"the return of the voice\\" is a little inaccurate in that her voice has changed over the years to a point of no return: no returning to the days of confident, convictive singing (as demonstrated in early hits \\"Vision of Love\\", \\"Vanishing\\", \\"Anytime You Need a Friend\\" probably being the last of this type of singing).  These days we've grown accustomed to Mariah's whispy, airy, light, hissing voice  and classifying it as part of an \\"incredible [insert your number of octaves here] range\\" (this hissing has been so bad that in some songs it's necessary to adjust the tone so as to not hurt my ears).  I actually think she has lost some 'umph' to her voice and when she attempts the full voice (like a Whitney or a Deborah Cox) it's more of a shriek a la Celine Dion (which is usually awful but for me because it's Mariah it's tolerable).      The only other glaring problem is in the lyrics she writes - it seems she takes words from previous releases and rejumbles them in an effort to come up with new stuff.  I'd actually love for once for her to not write or sing about lost love (jeter & miguel), liberation from an overbearing relationship (mottola), the idea of blissful love (back to jeter or miguel or whoever) and sticking it to the man that did her wrong (as in Charmbracelets \\"Clown\\" or Emancipations \\"Shake It Off\\").  She should return to the versatility of writing songs of substance like \\"Vision of Love\\", \\"There's Got to Be a Way\\", \\"The Wind\\", \\"Vanishing\\" and \\"One Sweet Day\\" or inspiring songs such as \\"Hero\\" {but not in the \\"Can't Take that Away\\" manner} or \\"Make It Happen\\".    The harshness of the words above isn't saying she doesn't do a good job with what she has on \\"Emancipation\\", in fact, it's her best stuff since Music Box and for what it's worth (which is apparantley alot: a #1 album debut and a 16th #1 single) she admirably makes an attempt to sound like the old Mariah, mostly in the silky, beautiful \\"We Belong Together\\" and the soulful, Motown/Ripperton-ish \\"Mine Again\\".  She does show us some fun versatility in the funky \\"Say Something\\" with Snoop and demonstrates an almost full-voiced feel in \\"One and Only\\" (with Twista) and \\"Circles\\".  \\"Your Girl\\" is a good song and is almost 70's Jackson 5-esque (not that Jackson 5 would sing about being anyone's girl).  \\"Shake It Off\\" and \\"It's Like That\\" are surprisingly good.  The music in \\"I Wish I Knew\\" is respectable soulful seventies stuff but unfortunately, the best part of the delivery of her voice is her deep, chocolatey speaking voice, the rest of her singing in this song is the whispy hissing that changes, rather harshly, to her shrieks and shrills.  \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"Get Your Number\\" and \\"To The Floor\\" are to please the Mtv genre.  \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" has a Minne Ripperton/Motown/Gospel feel but, sadly, fails in it's delivery and only showcases the hissing, shrilling and shreiking that in my opinion has typified her voice the last few years (the background singers in this song steal the show).  At the end of the song \\"Joyride\\", when she sings the line \\"we found love\\", for ten splendid seconds close your eyes and she'll take you back to the voice of 1990, letting it loose - clean and unhithered, unfortunatley, she closes the song rather whispily (if that's a word).    Although she'll never again be the Mariah Carey of 1990 (hell, none of us will ever be what we were, but we should also improve with age), Emancipation is a respectable effort and I am very glad to see Mariah back on top.    09/05 Update:  I've had months to soak this release in.  I initially underrated this release.  Not because it has become so popular but because it really has some good tunes.  I ended up liking \\"Joy Ride\\" the absolute best, finding your soul mate.  Beautiful song with a good message.  Still love We Belong Together, 14 weeks, i was cheeringfor it to go to 15 or 16, too bad.  shake It off has always been fun and i'm hoping it hits #1.  I've changed my mind about the last song, it is a good song.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Still taking in this album, it is very different from their previous albums. Its a definate improvement from ToT. I like the fact that all their albums are very distinguishable, all these people giving them suggestions is a bit rediculous. Are you in the band? I forgot that bands write what they want to. Yes IaW was awsome, but its nice to here a band that you never know whats coming next. They do take a lot of influences that are very present. I actually think they take these influences and do them better than those bands. I am going to have to listen to this more, definately worth the money.
0316172324|4.0|Malcom Caldwell has done a good job with Blink, his latest work.  Blink is a good introductory book on the growing field of behavioral scientists performing research on how little things, which appear to be meaningless, do carry a lot of power.  Those things can make or break the next big deal you are working on, help you advance your career or help you have a wonderful long-lasting marriage.    The book is still very unstructured and in many cases comes out as anecdotical.  The truth is that Malcom had the courage to write about something in which science is only beggining to get his hands on and therefore there are not many major studies that can place of this wonderful knowledge in a structured system to be used.  Despite this fact, the lessons from Blink are very relevant to your professional and personal life.    If you really want to make the book experience more meaningful, look for other studies related to snap judgement. Of particular interest is the MIT's research on Micro-Inequities, or subtle-discrimination acts that often come as simple as a change in the voice tone or a gesture addressing a co-worker that is different from how you address the rest of them.  It's very likely that your colleague will pick this immediately, even if you are speaking kind words to him or her.     The truth is we do process tons of information every single day and the phenomenon is not easing in the information age.  We will continue to process more and more info and therefore snap judgements will grow in your daily life. People are very selective in which things they pay attention to and which things they dismiss -- it has become an act of survival to the information overload.  If you do really want to win the next project or you want to avoid presenting you or your company in a negative way you do need to know your customers and know which buttons trigger their snap judgement. In many cases you don't even have one hour to persuade somebody to buy your product -- it can beas short as 30 seconds on a call or a glance on an internet ad; or even in the first few minutes of the sales call in which you customer makes her mind.  If you actually want to use this for marketing purposes I also recommend you to read Robert Cialdini's classic Persuasion.    Blink also tells us that in some professions and under some extenuating circumstances (e.g. police work, physicians) our snap judgements are made over a very narrow set of variables.  Understanding this can help us avoid those situations and actually save lives.    Finally, you can also use many of the learnings from here to understand how simple, rather innocent situations can destroy valuable personal relationships, such as your marriage.      Blink is a good book, entretaining read, given its storytelling.  Its major flaws are that it is still unstructured and therefore its lacks contundent conclusions.  Also, without reading other books on related subjects you can probably see most of the contents as unrelated anecdotical material.  But don't judge it on a blink -- it helps understand other behavioral studies on how we deal with information better and that is priceless.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|Try as I might, I just can't get into this album.  I have been a big S.O.A.D. supporter from the beginning.  I have seen them live around 5-6 times (great live show) so this is not just a nu-metal hater sounding off about how bands like this should just go away.  But, man is this the best they could come up with?  I think not.  I think my major beef with this CD is the fact that Daron sings WAAAAYYY too much on this, with a singer as talented as Serj why would they give a guy who sounds like a 12 year old crackhead with ADD so much mic time?  He works on previous efforts in small (very small) doses.  I just can't beleive all the fanboys giving this 5 stars, the first album was demented and disturbing, still my favorite work they have done.  Toxicity, great album even though a bit more mainstream.  And Steal this Album in all it's goofyness was still fun and heavy enough to warrant a release even though it was no more than a collection of B sides.  It's pretty sad when I can say that I like the B-sides better than the new material.  Don't get me wrong there are a couple of good old school SOAD cuts on here, BYOB is hard not to like,Revenga, and Cigaro are also not bad.  It still seems to me like they were unfocussed and possibly way drugged up for this one.  I am all for experimentation and progression with a band but this album is just crappy and that's all there is to it.  If you are a superfan, buy this you will most definately find something to like(and you probably already have this atrocity)  but if you thought that Toxicity was too mainstream then stay away from this at all costs.  Thank god I burned this off a friend before purchasing it.  Check out the new Mudvayne instead.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Are they going to tour with this nightmare? I have yet to hear a tune on this album that makes me say: \\"Whoah.\\". This album has a better chance at a book reading than it does in concert.<br /><br />As for an album in and of itself, I almost laughed when I heard the 4th track, \\"I Walk Beside You\\". This song should have been on the Karate Kid motion picture soundtrack. You can actually picture the montage of Daniel training and Myagi snapping flies as this song plays in the background.<br /><br />Mike Portnoy is always referencing \\"Balls and Chunk\\". What happened? There's not one song on this mess of an album that carries one ounce of balls and chunk. Maybe... just maybe Panic Attack - but it's out of place.<br /><br />The Rainbow Brite sing-along CD has a better chance on tour than Octavarium. And in the end, if the band is happy with this album, so be it. Not sure too many fans are going to be jammin' to this one. Dream Theater fans beware, this falls way below FII. I say that with conviction as well. At least every previous album had one, if not more, stand-out kick-ass tunes on it. There is always one that stands out. You can even tell in the fans reviews... You get the one guy who says: \\"Unbelievable!\\". Another says: 'Track # X is the best on this album. Can't wait to play it for the agillionth time.\\"<br /><br />To sum up: This album needs a producer. An outside look before they O.K. the album. I feel they didn't really have a direction with this album. Some of the reviewers here reference this album to be a tribute album. In all honesty, they are not far from the truth. At least with their other albums, side FII, they went with a direction and produced and album with heart and soul... at least with some \\"Balls and Chunk\\".
B00006M183|5.0|\\"Riot Act\\" is in many ways the album that Pearl Jam has been pointing towards for their entire career.  The band's sound, a blend between grunge and AOR rock with healthy punk aesthetic and an experimental edge, sat uncomfortably album to album-- when it worked, it was brilliant, but more often than not, the records were inconsistent.  But on this album, things all come together. <br /> <br />Also helping out the album is the strength of the material-- vocalist Eddie Vedder's songs in particular shine brightly on this one, from a building, churning, powerful pieces (\\"Can't Keep\\", \\"I Am Mine\\", the latter with a nearly ecstatic chorus), to a beautiful meditation on losing someone (\\"Thumbing My Way\\"), a wordless a vocal piece that is nothing short of stunning (\\"Arc\\"), and a reflection on love and the Roskilde Festival tragedy (\\"Love Boat captain\\") with some of Vedder's greatest lyrics: \\"It's an art to live with pain, mix the light into grey / lost nine friends we'll never know, two years ago today / and if our lives become too long, would it add to our regret?\\" <br /> <br />There are a number of other really great pieces on the record, drummer Matt Cameron's \\"Cropduster\\" and \\"You Are\\" both are fantastic and feature superb arrangements, the latter in particular has some of the best vocal harmonies on any Pearl Jam album, band composition \\"Save You\\" is seemingly unlimited in its energy and it feels as though it ends far too quick, and Stone Gossard's \\"Bushleaguer\\" featuring spoken word verses and a great rhythmic chorus to match biting lyrics is intriguing. <br /> <br />Long story short, this is the album I was certainly waiting for, and it got me listening to Pearl Jam again.  Essential listening.
B0006L16N8|5.0|What else is there to say Coldplay has done it again with flying colors Praise Coldplay for their effort into putting out great medolic music this cd is for sure going to become a best seller and one of their very best ranked up with Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This isn't a review I'm going to approach like I would a normal one-- \\"Lost Dogs\\" is a collection of 30 b-sides, tracks from benefit albums, and unreleased material.  This is not likely the place to look for the casual fan, but it really is a fantastic set. <br /> <br />One of the things about Pearl Jam's first album was there was a wealth of material that didn't make it on the album that was superb-- b-sides like \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" (concert and radio staple, likely left off because of its resemblance to Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\"), \\"Footsteps\\" (a haunting piece left off because it was already released with Cornell's lyrics as Temple of the Dog's \\"Times of Trouble\\") and fan favorite \\"Wash\\" are all as powerful as the material on \\"Ten\\". <br /> <br />But \\"Ten\\" wasn't the only album that great material was left off of-- \\"Down\\" and \\"U\\" from \\"Riot Act\\" and \\"Yield\\" respectively are superb, exciting and ecstatic in a way nothing on the album was.  And certainly there are few Pearl Jam pieces as superb as \\"Dead Man\\" (originally written for the \\"Dead Man Walking\\" soundtrack but left off in favor of a Bruce Springsteen track), with its haunting, throbbing bass and downright frightening lyrics. <br /> <br />The other thing you get here is a lot of fun and silly songs-- \\"Don't Gimme No Lip\\", featuring a Stone Gossard vocal and the bizarre \\"Dirty Frank\\" (about a psychotic bus driver and done in a funky Chili Peppers style) are good examples of this.  The band never put stuff like this on their albums, but they're really a trip. <br /> <br />Noticable absences from this set are \\"Breath\\" and \\"State of Love and Trust\\" from the \\"Singles\\" soundtrack, \\"I Got ID\\" and \\"Long Road\\" from the \\"Merkinball\\" single, \\"Yield\\" era b-side \\"Leatherman\\", and from the \\"Sweet Relief\\" benefit album, \\"Crazy Mary\\".  But even without this material, this is a superb collection.  Recommended for all Pearl Jam fans.
B00005JNTX|4.0|WOW! What an awesome film. It is based on 3 out of 7 Frank Miller books: #1, The Hard Goodbye, #3, The Big Fat Kill and #4 That Yellow Bastard. Also, fans will recognize the opening scene, as its the short story \\"The customer is always right\\". This film is amazing beyond description. The msot faithful comic book adaptation EVER. Why the four stars? Because the DVD will have nothing on it! I'd give the film 5, but this DVD itself is as naked as the girls of Sin City! So fans of Special Editions, and of course of Sin City: save your cash. Robert Rodriguez himself stated that there WILL be A Special Edition coming later. Just a warning....
B0009A1AS2|5.0|The purpose of an Amazon review is not to tell the reader what to think about the album, but whether or not it is worth buying in their opinion. So, in the interest of not being another parrot saying how awesome you should think this album is... I will stick to the facts. <br /> <br />Octavarium is a new thing for Dream Theater, one where they accepted criticisms about Train of Thought, in particular the excess length of tracks. Therefore they challenged themselves to write concisely and focus on the tracks' value as songs, shifting the focus off of the album as a whole and onto songwriting. <br /> <br />The result is undeniable. The songwriting is more cohesive, the band plays together, and the sound is overall better. The downside to this is that these shorter songs are also simpler. Tracks like \\"The Answer Lies Within\\"--written by Petrucci for one of his children--\\"These Walls\\" and \\"I Walk Beside You\\" have less of the soloing that Dream Theater is known for and more music where the band works together as a whole. On these three tracks in particular, the music is catchy, even \\"poppy\\" in some respects, but not as far as \\"mainstream\\". The best of these three is probably \\"These Walls\\", a song that could almost be radio rock, but it is radio rock the way only Dream Theater could do it. <br /> <br />But it is DT's other virtues that make the radio-friendliness on this album overlookable, even enjoyable. Beyond these three are a Dream Theater that is more focused and intense than ever before. Of particular note is Octavarium, the 24-minute epic, which could be their most emotional song from any album. It invokes at once Pink Floyd, Kansas, Yes, Genesis and Megadeth.  <br /> <br />It is these continual references to rock influences and the way they are used that makes Dream Theater stand out. They take elements of many styles and blend them together in a way that can only be called progressive. If \\"Never Enough\\" reminds you of Muse, then DT intended it to be so. But theyhave done something with the song that Muse could never do. <br /> <br />So, is the album worth buying? For the fan, it is always worth hearing the band \\"do something new like they always do\\" and succeed at it. For the new listener, this album gives a good sample of what Dream Theater is all about, having moments from every period in their history but looking toward the future. Some of it is hard to digest, especially for the hardcore fan who never expected a U2 song out of Dream Theater-- although anyone who has heard their Elton John covers shouldn't really be suprised at the variety of their influences. But this one is definitely worth a listen. Or ten. Then decide for yourself what you think. Make sure to give yourself this opportunity.
B0002ZTBRQ|4.0|Ok. Thats what the DareDevil film is. It was darker than Spider-Man yes, but not as good. THIS Director's Cut, however, makes the film good. Before you judge DareDevil, see both cuts: the theatrical and this Director's &quot;should-have-been-theatrical-but-isn't&quot; For starters, THIS film is rated... R. The fight scenes are more intense, the film is MUCH darker, (a-la Frank Miller) and there's a few swears. So, THIS is the film to see. Watch both for the sake of seeing the difference.
B00005JNTX|3.0|Did you guys know there was an invention a few years ago called color television?  So what if it is a comic strip? Did you know its cheaper to make a movie in black and white? Quentin Tarantino is laughing all the way to the bank on this one, and don't give me the \\"he was experimenting, trying to make a comic book, made a revolutionary new idea\\" statement. The old 70's spider man series did this concept ages ago.  <br /> <br />Anyway. Some of the mini stories are interesting, some where silly or boring. I am not a big KillBill fan either. I like Quentin Tarantino when he does stuff like \\"from dusk till dawn\\" <br />Sin city might be worth watching once, but I would not see it again. Loved the violence though :)  <br />
B00080ZG10|1.0|And I thought Titanic was bad! This movie takes the cake. Leo doesn't even resemble Howard Hughes whatsoever. It's as if he didn't do any research for this film. You gotta do research!!! The woman that played Miss Hepburn was also pretty lame. <br /> <br />If you looking for a quality film with DiCaprio, get \\"The Beach\\".
B00006D295|1.0|Musicals make me ill, and this one will try to put you in touch with your feminine side if you know what I mean! You should all be ashamed! This movie is so bad that when they released it in movie theaters, people started making jokes at the movie, and started doing \\"slapstick\\" responses to the movie. Eventually, this became the norm, and fans started calling it the \\"rituals\\" that you performed during the movie when you went and seen it. For example, when a certain line in the movie was said, everyone in the theater would run to the back wall and hit it with their hands as fast as they could. These \\"rituals\\" got so out of hand, it eventually became a cult. You had to go through an initiation if it was your first time seeing the movie. For example, singing the Oscar Myer song while bending over. So there you have it. A movie that was so bad, people actually had to interact with it in hopes of making it better. LAME! NOT HORROR!  NO GORE!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|All right, well, this is my first review, and I am doing this in response to the truly atrocious views people have expressed on this site. A7X is awesome, they have established this before the cd, and merely affirm it with the new release. Lets go through the track listing, shall we? <br />1. The Beast and the Harlot <br />This is not the greatest song, and it was not a good move for them to let the public hear this before the album came out. But still, it grows on you, and this is a catchy tune. The guitar really rocks on this, along with the rest of the songs on the cd. <br />2. Burn It Down <br />The drums at the opening of the track set the stage for the song. This sounds like the stuff we are used to hearing on waking the falling, just leaving out the screaming. The tempo is fast, and if it were a bit heavier, would be an excellent song to head bang too, but its somewhere in the middle on the heavy scale. Awesome song overall, I enjoyed it thoroughly. <br />3. Blinded in Chains <br />This is the song that truly made me want to go further into the album. Right at the onset, they shred. And then the drums come through like thunder piercing an already troubled night sky. The vocals are also great here, Shadows shows that he still has the range, even with out screaming here.  <br />4. Bat Country <br />My favorite song on the album, genuinely great. Bat Country starts off with saying right off the back with a quote. \\"He who makes a beast out of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man\\". I don't recall who said that, but its true. The song is great, it is quiet at times, but blasting at others, the musical range is great. We are also treated to a stellar solo in this song. I fell in love with the chorus as well; I love how Shadows sings it. <br />5. Trashed and Scattered <br />Yes! Finally...some screaming, or kind of some screaming...Shadows sings loudly at least. The other band members shred the whole song in this, showing that A7X is not just about Shadows. The non-explicit parts of the song are forgettable...but still, the actual music is great.  <br />6.Seize the Day <br />Avenged Sevenfold pretends to be an emo band for a bit here, and is successful at it. This song is softer than the others, but still is faithful to the theme set by the tracks prior to this one. The vocals are great, and take center stage in this track. That's not to degrade the quality of the actual music, which again is top quality. I did not enjoy this song intensely, but still, its a great change of pace track. <br />7.Sidewinder <br />Back to the shredding. The guitar fades in, and then the drums start pumping midway through the onset of the vocals. The lyrics are also engaging, I believe they is talking about being a vampire, but I could be mistaken.  <br />8.The Wicked End <br />This is easily the second best song on the cd. The tempo is fast, and the music is great. The vocals are not stellar, but Shadows sings well nonetheless. The lyrics are also interesting, and for someone who enjoys interpreting the meaning of a song like myself, then you should have fun with this one. <br />9. Strength of the World <br />Ok, I did not like this song all that much. The song opens soft, and after already listening too the change of pace song, Seize the day, I did not appreciate it as much as the other tracks. But then the music begins to get harder, and my enjoyment begins...sort of. I still was not a fan. I did not like the part where it said Strength of the World in a non metal way repeatedly. But I enjoyed the rest of the song. <br />10. Betrayed <br />This is my third favorite song on the album. At the onset, we are treated to a very good bit of guitar. I was not the biggest fan of the vocals at first, but as the track progressed they grew on me. <br />11. M.I.A. <br />Opens up softly, but I was not as ticked at it for doing so as I was with Strength of the World. Perhaps it's because I liked the tune of it, which I did...or because I knew it was thelast track on a solid album. Once the heavy stuff begins, my enjoyment level immediately rose. This is a very good track. <br /> <br />Well, that's it. I hope this clears some stuff up about the CD to the people who are on the edge of buying this. Please do, but go in with an open mind, and focus on enjoying it for what it is, rather than hating it for being something it isn't. Besides, A7X has a right to decide what path they choose to take musically. <br />Over all, it has its faults, but it easily obtains a 5 star rating in my book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0008ISM40|1.0|It is slow, droll, and just about the most painfully boring music CD I have heard in a long time. I threw mine in the trash (no joke) <br />
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Just about every song on this album ROCKS. Love his lyrics and the sweet melodies. Favorite songs on this album are \\"Follow Through\\", \\"Just Friends\\", \\"Chariot\\", and \\"More Than Anyone\\".
B0007TKNL0|1.0|I remember reading the phantom of the opera back in school, and so far, no movie has ever come close to making it into what it was supposed to be: a very dark drama  This movies corny, you should all be ashamed! every line is silly, every other line is sang. Who sits through these ear shattering, glass breaking musicals anyway? (stuck up conservatives? Elderly people? Or geeky girls who get engulfed in romance novels?)  When the girls voice wasn't pounding into my skull like a jack hammer, the movie was just boring. I had to stop it, I couldn't take no more. My level of insanity went up after watching this
B00007AJF9|3.0|If you like historically accurate movies you may want to past this one by. However if you just like period dramas then you must  see \\"Elizabeth\\".  Cate Blanchett  does a wonderful job of portraying an alternative view of a young Elizabeth Boleyn.  Instead of the strong powerful woman we've come to expect, director Shekahar Kapur and writer Michael Hirst, decided to show a younger, unproven Queen of England.  Covering a period of about two years, beginning just shortly before her succession to the throne, the movie attempts to draw us into the Tudor dynasty (in reality the events happened over a much longer period of time). It was most successful in spotlighting the dynamic relationship between Elizabeth and the men in her life. (King Henry VIII 's absents is noted). Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare in Love ) did a fine job as, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Geoffrey Rush (Shine) conspired with skill as Sir Francis Walsingham; and Christopher Eccleston (Dr. Who) pulled as much out of the Duke of Norfolk as he could. Honestly however we've seen each of them in better roles. An excellent score and breath taking cinematography along with award winning costume designs rounds out this entertaining film.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I like SOAD. I have been a fan from day one, even when they were putting out songs that are on none of their albums. I have waited awhile to post my review on this album till I made good and sure my opinion wouldn't change. First, I must say this is in no way better than any of their previous albums. Anyone remember songs like Marmalade? Toxicity? Prison? Sugar? Spider? Suite-Pee? Come on, this isn't even close! The album has a very rushed sound too it, as if it was slapped together overnight. The lyrics and music are no where near as elaborate as their old stuff. I also do not like the pop influences on this album. This band has incorporated a little too much pop in it. I think its an \\"ok\\" album, but it is far from great. My break down <br />(1) Soldier side - 0/5 - its an intro! I call it time killing <br />(2) B.Y.O.B -  2/5 - I cannot get over the chorus of this song. I am NOT joking when I say it sounds EXACTLY like a back street boys chorus. I just cannot get past it.  <br />(3) Revenga - 3/5 sounds like soad, it's an ok song except for the dumb Clementine lyrics  <br />(4) Cigaro - 4/5 - Funny, until you hear it about 5 times, also very short <br />(5) radio/video - 2/5 - repetitive sell out song with stupid lyrics <br />(6) the coke... 5/5 - a good, heavy song <br />(7) Violent... 4/5 - another half way decent song <br />(8) Question 4/5 - a decent song, remincent of old SOAD <br />(9) Sad Statue 4/5 - a good song, light and heavy <br />(10) Old school 3/5 - a little too digital, but ok song with a catchy repetitive chorus <br />(11) Lost in Hollywood 2/5 - A long, boring extend version of song ten...like the intro, a lot of time killing here <br />Overall = 3/5 <br />Sorry SOAD, hope the next CD is better, although I will still listen to this one now and then.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I can only speak of this motion picture in glowing terms.  It wasn't just any movie, it was an experience.  After watching the DVD, I appreciated this film even more. <br /> <br />I applaud the Director's vision in casing younger actors.  This version of the story is prettied up and more youthful and appealing than what has gone before.  This artistic endeavor stands alone in its unique approach, great singing talent, and cast chemistry that complies with the tone and mood of the story.  Hopefully, many newcomers will be attracted to this haunting tale and beautiful music. <br /> <br />Gerard Butler gives a wonderfully insightful portrayal of the phantom, exuding a profound depth of emotion and sensuality that captures your attention.  It was worth seeing the movie for his performance alone.  His rendition of \\"Point Of No Return\\" was dynamic. <br /> <br />As a long-time POTO fan, I continue to have appreciation for the stage version that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman are famous for; their talent remains unrivaled.   <br /> <br />The reviews here seem to indicate that one is either strongly affected or disaffected by this film.  To have so many more favorably rate this movie suggests its powerful impact.  <br /> <br />The 2-disc DVD has a new song sung by Butler.  Of special note is the dedicated piece to the history of the musical inception and stage versions with clips of Crawford and Brightman that will interest POTO fans. <br /> <br />If you bought the DVD and didn't like the movie, consider gifting it to someone who will love it. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Many people say they hate this movie. They say the humor is not funny, and then they go on to cite the scenes in the movie that are not funny. For instance, the scene where Napoleon fails to make the bicycle jump and hits his crotch on the bike frame. I agree, not one of the scenes that most people reference as jokes are funny. It's not meant to be funny. It's meant to be nostalgic. <br />The opening music, \\"We're Going to Be Friends\\" a sentimental piece about childhood by the White Stripes sets the nostalgic tone for the entire movie. Every scene from the credits onward is meant to evoke sympathy for the main character, not humor. It would be hard stretch for anyone to think that getting hit with food is the pinnicle of comedy. However, to anyone that was alienated in high school, getting hit with food was just one of the things you had to put up with. Seeing Napoleon put up with it in a dignified way allows people who were in his position reclaim some of their own dignity. <br />All throughout the movie Napoleon is faced with situations that would make most people cry. He perseveres and stays true to himself, just like he tells Pedro to do before the class president speech. It is this process of taking comfort from bitter situations or even courageously quipping a one liner in the face of dehumanizing alienation that gives this film its infectious charm. <br />If you go into the movie prepared to laugh at Napoleon or anyone else in the movie you will be sorely disappointed. To really find humor in this movie you are forced to find humor in your own past alienation. Unfortunately for some people this is too difficult to do, and they come away from this movie dissatisfied. Those who are able to laugh at themselves will find this movie to be satisfyingly bitter sweet.
B0006L16N8|2.0|It pains me to write that this album is overhyped, overvalued, and overdone.  This will not be the last Coldplay album and this will def never be considered the best Coldplay album.  With such a strong debut and powerful second record, it just seemed inevitable that these guys would continue to release gems.  They just didnt quite pull it off this time, unfortunately.  However, people will continue to buy their music, they will continue to tour, and they will hopefully continue to make music.  Hopefully this wont be their best effort from here on in.  I would like to hear all the material they supposedly scrapped in the 3 years between Rush and X and Y.
B0000E6XKF|5.0|Ive been a fan of the Chili Peppers for years and this is the closest that i have come to actually seeing them live, it is simply amazing! <br /> <br />Flea's bass playing is possibly the best i have ever heard from him, his bass lines for \\"Around the world\\" and \\"Throw away your television\\" are even more impressive live than they are on CD! There are also some very impressive solos and jams with John that you will be blown away by! <br /> <br />Anthony's vocals are spot on and his energy on stage is incredible, i dont know how he has the stamina to jump around and dance lie that for so long! <br /> <br />Chad's drumming is as solid as ever and towards the end there is even a fun little drum solo from him which really gets the crowd going before Flea comes on with his trumpet! <br /> <br />Finally, John Frusciante, words cannot really describe how much of his soul he pours into this performance! You really haven't lived until you have heard one of the many solos and improvisations that he includes in this gig. Anyone who has heard his version of \\"I feel love\\" from Hyde Park will love the cover of \\"Maybe\\" that he does in his unique falsetto voice, as well as the short Fugazi section at the start of \\"Parallel Universe\\". His rhythm is great and i don't know how he plays with such accuracy whilst diving all over the stage in his energetic manner! <br /> <br />As for the quality of the DVD itself, it doesn't include many extras (there are a few wallpapers but thats about it) but with such an amazing performace you really don't need them! <br /> <br />Oh, and to the person who said \\"john's guitar playing should not be talked about. cuz it's not even worth it. go buy joe satriani's dvd or steve vai's dvd. those are the real hardcore pros. any guitar beginners can play what john does\\", you really don't know what you are talking about mate. Yes, many of the intros to songs that he does are quite easy but if you have ever tried to go further into the main body of ANY of the songs then you will see how technically difficult they actually are. He really is one of the best guitarists out there!
B0006L16N8|3.0|The new Coldplay album is somewhat of a disapointment just because its to ''produced'' for my taste.It does sound like u2 even if Chis Martin is contradicting that in every interview.I was hoping for a mix between the first to albums but x&y is far from that,there's actually not one song that reminds me of the ''real'' coldplay.Speed of sound is okay and thats all the good i can think about right now...
B00004TWZF|1.0|What a preposterous pseudo-intellectual exercise in masturbatory quasi homoerotic Jacques Cousteau fantasy fair.  Most of the idiots that believe this is a good movie probably won't understand any of what I just wrote. Does anybody really, I mean REALLY think this is a good movie?  Worthy of 5 stars? Are you all mentally deranged? Man plus Dolphin plus Rosanna Arquette plus the French language equals A WASTE OF LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can I have the two and a half hours I spent watching this celluloid sleep aide back or shall I regret hearing of this movie until the day I die? This movie may have been slightly bearable had Rosanna Arquette been replaced with her sister (the one that's in that T.V. pap-loid called Medium), provided that she spent most of the film in the nude.  The \\"best movie I've ever seen?\\"  Are you kidding me?  Is your life THAT insipid?  If you dream of floating in a weightless ocean of bliss while dolphins prance about you to the strains of the latest Enya CD then this movie IS \\"the best movie ever made\\".  But frankly, I prefer to have a plate of escargo and cheese while watching Solaris (the original 6 hour Soviet answer to Stanley Kubrick's 2001 - A Space Oddysey).  At least that's what I think.  May Allah Bless You.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I have really enjoyed this new Dream Theater album, Octavarium.  It has a great variety of songs and I feel that I will be picking up on some of the music's nuances for quite a while.  It is a great progressive rock album, with a leaning toward hard rock.    These guys are beginning to push the twenty year mark as a band (if you include the \\"pre-When Dream And Day Unite\\" release).  I believe that Dream Theater is just beginning to define its signature sound.  These guys ahve so many great ideas and Octavarium greatly showcases their innovative side.    Highly recommended!    Here is why:    This album ranges in sound from pure metal to symphonic progressive rock.  Overall, it has to be considered progressive rock since there are other sounds, too.  There are small elements of electronica hear and there, as well as the newer U2 sound.    I also believe that there is a good deal of emotion behind the music in this release.  If you're a shred-head (ie.  you dig Malmsteen, Vai, Satriani), then don't buy this album.  John Petrucci is not just a shredder, he's a song-writer and he's just starting to really show that talent on this album.      Also, I have listened to this album at least ten times....  It was great from the first listen and it will remain in my car's CD player for a long while.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|All I can say is wow...this album is probably one of the best I've ever heard..and without a doubt can be played from start to finish without having to skip a song..each song is beautifully sung and wonderfully written! Its hard to pick a favourite but from 'Stripped' I'd have to say 'More Than Anyone' & 'Belief'. <br /> <br />'Chariot' itself is very impressive but 'Stripped' will just blow you away..truly unbelievable. Gavin is a rare talent and no one should lack this album from their collection! <br />
B0009IW98O|4.0|Detroit music in the 1960's and early 1970's was more than just Motown. The area also produced cult favorites and proto-heavy rockers like The Stooges and the MC5. Unless you're from Detroit, however, you may be unaware that Detroiter Bob Seger released a series of albums before he arrived on the national stage in the mid-1970's with break-out hits such as 'Night Moves\\" and 'Beautiful Loser'. In fact, for quite a few years, both Seger and his fans bemoaned the lack of national attention his work received. Looking back on some of his work reveals why his local fans were perplexed at his delayed ascent, and also why a national audience eluded Seger.  <br /> <br />'Smokin' O.P.'s' (meaning smoking other people's... in this case other people's hits rather than cigarettes, although the front insert is a wonderfully simplistic play on a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes) is a great collection of cover songs. In his early incarnations Seger sounded much more like the sharp-edged J. Geils Band (who first gained acclaim with their 'Full House' LP, recorded at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit) than the more middle-of-the-road rocker he became in the mid-'70's. 'Smokin' O.P.'s' was Bob's fifth album, released in 1972, and for the most part was a collection of excellent cover songs. Most are standard hard-rock offerings (the sound that went down best in local Detroit venues) including an impressive opening trio of Ellis McDaniel's 'Bo Diddley/Who Do You Love', Stephen Stills' 'Love the One You're With', and Tim Hardin's 'If I Were a Carpenter'. The first two songs feature slick lead guitar solo's from Monk Bruce, while 'If I Were a Carpenter' owes it's foundation and some great solo work to organist Skip Knape (aka 'Van Winkle' from 'Teegarden & Van Winkle'; David Teegarden provides percussion on this disc as well).  <br /> <br />On the original vinyl release side one mellowed out a bit at the end with a cover of Leon Russell's 'Hummin' Bird' (\\"don't fly away\\"). Seger is really showing some grit by covering these four classic hits, and while it's hard to say that any of them surpass the original versions, they are sung with an obvious joy and excitement that make them a thrill to experience. It's probably the best single album side Seger put together before his more acclaimed persona emerged.  <br /> <br />The remaining five tracks offer a couple gems as well. Seger offers a sweet version of 'Turn On Your Love Light', feeding off a funky rhythm guitar foundation, and the closer, a remake of Seger's 1966 hit with The Heard, 'Heavy Music'. 'Heavy Music' seems misplaced on the disc, as does it's predecessor, 'Someday'. Both are Seger compositions (which doesn't fit with the theme of the album), 'Someday' is a misfit as a quiet, piano-based ballad, and 'Heavy Music' would serve much better as an opener than the closer. 'Let It Rock', the opener of side two, comes across as a generic bar-hall stomper, and 'Jesse James', while less distinguished than some of the other tracks, has a beat like a churning locomotive that blends in well with the albums other tracks.  <br /> <br />While there's a lot to like on 'Smokin' O.P.'s' including some excellent musicianship, quality composing ('Heavy Music'), and an audibly resounding desire to deliver \\"the goods\\", clearly Seger needed to develop more consistency, and broaden his range of music to become an elite performer, a mystery he solved as the '70's progressed. It's a shame that Bob has not seen fit to reissue some of his earlier work, such as this disc, his original 'Bob Seger System' album, as well as 'Noah' and 'Mongrel'. On a smaller scale, for fans of Seger, not having access to these tracks is akin to only experiencing The Beatles from 'Rubber Soul' on. While these discs may not reveal the mature talent Seger would eventually develop, their raw energy and gritty late 60's/early 70's sound has its own vintage appeal. If you release them, Bob, the fans will come.   <br /> <br />2/8/05 ADDENDUM: Thanks, Bob!  Here we come! <br /> <br />
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have all of Slipknot's previous albums and although they kicked serious a$$, they lacked focus. That's sure not a problem with this record. To me, this has got to be Slipknot's best effort, and contrary to what many people say, for Slipknot to NOT shout as much does not mean they have sold out or toned down. Slipknot's music has matured and I for one, love it. <br /> <br />First of all, the music has not gone softer. Other than \\"Vermilion Pt. 2\\"...every song is classic Slipknot, but instead of going all over the place with drums, guitars, scratching and Corey's amazing vocals...they are crafted much better. Rick Rubin accomplished for Slipknot what he did for Red Hot Chili Peppers. He knows that the band has talent, and he just directs them down the correct path. I have heard each song many many times, and it just leaves me in awe at the power and strength of each song. Even the so-called ballad \\"Vermilion Pt. 2\\" conjures feelings of pain and torment. <br /> <br />In short, this band of 9 people never fail to astound me...they each play their parts so well, it all comes together perfectly. Slipknot's music transcends to so many levels, many people claim they're fans just to look cool. And when a number of people claimed they have become mainstream, those same people said the same to fit the masses. Well, screw them...this is one hell of an album that I listen to very often.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Este album, no es un Donde estan los ladrones? Pues es dificil derrocar a un album asi, hasta por la misma Shakira. Empero, Fijacion Oral Vol.1 es un album terrifico, y seria una obra maestra si dicho disco mencionado anteriormente no hubiera sido germinado. La espera no fue en vano, ya que cada cancion de este nuevo disco esta muy bien producido; cada sonido tiene un proposito. Y la voz de shakira ha madurado, vaya que cada vez se oye mejor. Estas esas personas que, con todo derecho, van a criticarlo por que esto o lo otro. A la mejor esperaban algo con la formula anterior, pero Shakira es una artista, alguien que siempre busca nuevo territorio, que explora, y que no tiene miedo a mesclar generos de musica. Un artista nunca deja de crecer y musicalmente, liricamente, y creativamente shakira no a parado de crecer. Cada disco tiene su firma de originalidad. Eso es lo que importa, que alguien diga \\"ese cancion es de shakira\\". Este disco es expansivo y progresivo. Es infalible su talento. Les aseguro que no saldra un album mejor que este. Tambien les recomiendo a el hermosisimo LOTOFIRE de ELY guerra. Estas dos artistas estan explorando territorio nuevo, pero nunca dejando ese rasgo latino. Arriba la buena musica.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Few movies engage the mind and touch the soul like this one. It is based on a simple premise but it is told in such a way that leaves me in awe everytime I watch it. <br /> <br />Joel is an all-round nice guy who lives a very normal and quiet life. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Clementine shows Joel the wild side of things. She makes things exciting. They're in love. But it's not long before each finds the other annoying. They feel suffocated in the relationship, and they want out. Clementine goes to a clinic and gets her memories removed. Joel, who finds out about this decides to do the same and we are shown glimpses of memories that is being erased while Joel is, in fact unconcious in his living room. <br /> <br />If I was unclear about the story, I'm sorry...but this is a movie that you have too see to truly understand. What grabbed me most about this movie was the screenplay and the acting. The story is something we all can relate to...I mean, who hasn't been so in love only to find that it's not working out and soon, you wish that you never met that person. Based on this, Charlie Kaufman has conjured a magnificent story about these two people, as different as light and day, who end up being happy with each another. The love between the characters are described in specific memories, and moments rather than words...and that's the true beauty of this movie. Because of this, it does not end up being like every other romantic movie out there. This movie also questions the viewer, if given a chance...would you really give up the memories of a past love? Would it make you happier? If that love is strong enough, could it bring the two of you back together? These are some of the questions that I pondered upon watching this movie. Charlie Kaufman deservedly won an Oscar for this screenplay. <br /> <br />The acting was also superb. Jim Carrey gives one of his best performances here. I was mesmerized by what he brought to his character. Kate Winslet also shinesin her role as Clementine. Their acting made the love between their characters seem so real and honest. They strengthen Kaufman's script so well that the whole movie seems natural. The supporting actors are no less impressive. The whole cast brings a certain authenticity to the movie. <br /> <br />To be honest, I have not watched a movie as good as this for a long time. It gives a breath of fresh air towards a dying genre of movies in Hollywood, and that is romance. Intelligent, creative and original are some of the words I would choose to describe this movie. You can do no wrong with getting \\"Eternal Sunshine...\\". Trust me.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I guess I am one of the lucky DT fans who actually likes all of their albums. There are only 2 or 3 songs by Dream Theater that I don't like. Luckily Octavarium has 8 songs that I either like or love and this is after listening to it only twice. Everyone knows that it takes a few listens to usually get into their songs but this time around they have really written some beautiful, energetic, and catchy as hell songs. I had no problem with Train of Thought but I am extremely happy that DT took the direction they did with Octavarium because it sounds like an awesome blend of all their old sounds combined with stuff I've never heard from this band. <br />1)Root of All Evil= a heavy, fist pumping, extremely rocking track with some great solos. A nice addition to the AA saga. <br />2)The Answer Lies Within= one of their most beautiful ballads ever written; if you liked Anna Lee and Hollow Years, this one is very similar. <br />3)These Walls= an amazingly catchy and progressive track, this one is probably the closest to \\"classic\\" DT; I'm thinking this could be the next Pull Me Under. <br />4)I Walk Beside You= a very positive and uplifting track that is surprisingly mainstream sounding; it's simplistic and commercial like You Not Me except this song is actually good! <br />5)Panic Attack= an explosive, fast, balls to the wall track that makes some of the songs on TOT seem slow. Awesome bass as well. <br />6)Never Enough= a very cool DT track although this one I have the hardest time explaining. It's pretty heavy but it also gives me a weird Matrix vibe with some of the keyboard stuff. The solos and unison section are what you'd come to expect from these guys. <br />7)Sacrificed Sons= a long epic track much like In The Name of God with some beautiful additions from the orchestra and another classic Dream Theater instrumental section. <br />8)Octavarium= an over 20 minute amazing track just like A Change Of Seasons, although they sound nothing like eachother. Octavarium is avery beautiful song with a lot of different sections that would be better to just listen to and experience rather then reading my explanation of it. <br />All in all, 8 great tracks making up one of my new favorite DT albums. Hope this helps.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|Dream Theater remains the best progressive rock band of all time, but Octavarium falls flat on so many levels it's embarrassing. Why did this album ever see the light of day?  Sure, it has hints of what it could have been. Some of the music is fantastic and has a great hook. Octavarium goes in places no other Dream Theater record has.  Unfortunately, these moments are few and far between.  This is a monotonous album, almost agonizing to listen to. Just when you think a song is going to really kick in, it instead drops heavy. No song ever really draws you in. And quite frankly, I had to force myself to listen to the 20-some minute epic song \\"Octavarium,\\" which had only a brief splash of interest at the end.  On top of that, the lyrics are almost painful to listen to. Dream Theater is much more talented than this. There are so many cliches in these lyrics and really, such a level of cheese, I felt embarrassed listening to them.  Dream Theater had a lot to build off of after \\"Train of Thought.\\" It's always exciting to see which direction they'll go in next. I didn't realize they'd go the direction of boring.  The band has said they recorded this album to sound like \\"Images and Words.\\" Nice to say, but far from true. This album has no appeal like I&W, or Metropolis II, or Six Degrees. It has nothing in common with any previous DT album except the equally subpar \\"Falling Into Infinity.\\"  Perhaps James LaBrie saved all the best material for his excellent solo record. But this is one Dream Theater fan who is extremely disappointed with this disaster.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I was excited for Coldplay's new release, and would have probably bought it even if the reviews were less than raving. I paricularly like the track \\"Fix You.\\" But don't be caught up in the hype that would have you believe this is the band's pivotal album. It is, in a word, awesome, but X&Y is exactly what you make of it.  The tracks stand on thier own as being examples of great music, and like all great music, they leave room for you to interpret and define them for yourself. X&Y caters to a variety of different genres and tastes, having something for everyone. This is what makes the album great; it's versatility. But by all means, don't take my word for it. Experience it for yourself... you'll be glad you did.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Even great bands occasionally release bad recordings.  DT has done so before (Falling Into Infinity, When Day and Dream Unite) and has done so again with this lackluster release.  I have no problem with DT trying to write shorter songs and expand their horizons.  They are just being incredibly inconsistent in their output.  I said this when I reviewed TOT but DT really needs an outside producer to fulfill their potential.  DT has never been an original band.  They are quite obvious in showing their influences [Megadeth (esp TOT), Rush (esp I&W), Yes, Radiohead, Peter Gabriel-era Genesis (SOAM)] and this record is no exception.    The problem is that the influences in this record includes (gulp!) Coldplay and  (okay, these guys rock!) Muse. This one is for fanboys(girls) only.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let it Be is not my favorite Beatle album, but it is a good one, and at least two of McCartney's greatest songs (Let it Be & The Long And Winding Road) are on it. And I've always thought that Spector did a pretty good job on the original album. Other than the production on Across the Universe and The Long and Winding Road the album is pretty much stripped down (as nature intended). And I actually like the orchestration on those two songs. I also like the stripped down versions here and on Anthology 3. But Let it Be Naked is a good album in many ways. The sound on some songs is better, especially One After 909. You can hear the bass better on some of the songs. And the version of Across the Universe is quite nice. You can hear George Martin playing the hammond organ behind Lennon's acoustic guitar. And though the version of the song Let It Be is good on this CD it's not necessarily any better than the one included on the original album. The version of the song there had a better guitar solo and Ringo plays a more interesting drum pattern as well. However, one advantage of the song on this CD is that you can hear the high backing vocals and organ better without the horns that George Martin added. As for the second disk, I would rather have some bonus tracks instead of this. I don't think I'll listen to it much as its a bunch of brief (10 or 15 seconds) bits of dialogue and songs. There are a couple of Lennon & McCartney originals that I've never heard including one called Because I Know You Love Me So, and another called Fancy My Chances With You. But we only get just over a minute of the first and 27 seconds of the second. There is a one minute recording called Paul's Piano Piece which is nice but more would be better. More music and a little less conversation would really be an improvement. I mean The Beatles' dialogue could be quite whimsical and interesting at times, as you can see from the samples in the booklet that comes with the CD, but on the bonus CD I can't understand most of what's being said anyway. I've owned quite a few bootlegs over the years, some I've lost and some I still have. But I know there are several tracks that didn't appear on the Anthology series that would be nice to have. For instance there is a McCartney song called \\"Common Wealth\\" that really rocks and has never been released anywhere but on bootleg records. The Beatles also recorded a number of old rock and roll classics during the Let it Be sessions and some of them are quite nice such as \\"Maybe Baby\\", \\"Crying Waiting Hoping\\" and \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy.\\" Five or ten of these unreleased recordings would really make Let it Be Naked much more special.understand most of what's being said anyway.

B00097DX3U|5.0|This cd kicks ass. #1 zero is a nice blues riff that reminds me of zep.  song is great.  love the guitar solos-i hope more bands return the guitar solo to most of thier songs cuz they rule.
B00005Y1UX|3.0|This story is basically talking about the newspaper outbreak about marriage infidelity (between a married man and a married woman). For those whom cannot cupcake regarding the subject (especially the chinese), do control your temper with people whom are buying these titles as most of the people are now English educated. A recommendation for those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film. Enjoy.....
B0007Y08QA|4.0|This movie with no question is fantastic and that means everything ,the story plot, the acting, the directing, editing. You name its solid. There is no reason to go into reviews as plenty of people have. Long story short, buy this movie it is well worth the $$$, i purchased it from best buy and didnt hesitate on spending $22 on it. An awesome pyscological thriller I rank it up there with movies like Jacobs Ladder and Donnie Darko. If you havent seen Donnie Darko or Jacobs Ladder go get them they are just as good as Machinist or vice versa. You cant go wrong with this purchase. And its quit sickening to see how skinny he is,its amazing how much weight he lost to do this film, he also to me has to be a very under used and under rated actor, he did a fine job in this movie,very fine.
6305657947|4.0|The story is basically about cstching some wrong doings which in the end got into an affairs.....a recommended purchase for those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film...... <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|The Police played and as they exited the stage they handed their instruments to U2, a passing of the baton, the former Biggest Band in the world handing the monacher over to the new one. Well, in a few years (maybe sooner) that will be the case with U2 and Coldplay.  <br /> <br />X&Y is not Rush of Blood to the Head, mach II. It's got some of the same sounds and themes, but then so did U2's early albums. But the new album is a sonic advancement from the last. It's not hard rock by any means, but musically it captures the soaring emotions that Coldplay's songs warrant. There are still quiet moments too, but they don't last long before the band breaks in from the stratosphere again.  <br /> <br />The album opener \\"Square One\\" is a driving juggernaut of a song - had me completely jaw-dropped. Then comes \\"What if,\\" a quieter ballad that acts like a sock in the gut (in a good way) after the giant opener. It's all good from there on through, with the possible exception of \\"A Message,\\" not a big fan of that one.  <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Coldplay, buy the album, you'll probably love it. If you're not, get over yourself, being \\"indie\\" doesn't make you cool. This stuff is mainstream for a reason: it's the best music on the planet right now.
B000001FKY|5.0|Plain and simple, short and sweet-this is one of my favorite rock albums ever made.It's mindless, reckless & loud, everything a good rocker should be.This is one I'd have to have on a deserted island if I were ever ship-wrecked. By no means is \\"Hysteria\\" high art, except in a \\"turn it up loud\\" sense, but then everyone deserves a guilty pleasure, or two, along the way, at least once in a while!
B00097A5I6|2.0|Everytime this band comes out with a new album I try really hard to like it.  And here I am again, trying really hard to enjoy \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\".  After listening to it a few times around, there isn't a single song that really stands out and grabs your attention.   <br /> <br />The whole album is basically Oasis' version of another era of music, mainly 60's rock.  What's the Story Morning Glory kick-started a Brit-pop revolution, this one feels like it never even happened.  There's nothing exciting, original, idealistic or inspiring in any of the songs and it feels like the band just got together to make some cash and help support their rock'n'roll lifestyle. <br /> <br />I'm disappointed again.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|To echo a point that another person has said before, you either love or hate Ryan.  However, even people who dislike Ryan Adams can be pleased by the majority of the tracks on 'Cold Roses'.  This album beautifully blends the serious musical leaps that he took with the Love Is Hell discs, and molds them into fit a supporting cast (the Cardinals) who may be of the best genre for Ryan, since the days of Whiskeytown.  I won't be telling you song for song how I feel, because that is not only exhausting, but easily forgettable.  The record is worth the $12 - plain and simple. <br /> <br />Secondly, I hate what I've done earlier in this review.  It is something that almost all music critics and fans are guilty of as well.  Albums like 'Heartbreaker' come across us once in a great while, while albums like \\"Rock'n'Roll\\" are produced seemingly everyday (Ryan made 'Rock-n-Roll' in a rock star type way to mock his record label after saying that the Love Is Hell discs did not have a single. Hence the poppy played out songs of the album.).  It is very unfair to compare anything that an artist does early in their career to later.  Much like greater bands that have came before (i.e. Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins), the praise that one receives for putting out an amazing album pales in comparison to the disappointment that most have when the follow up(s) are not at that same form and fashion.  But that's just my stupid opinion.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I have listened to Waking The Fallen a billion times because it is a TIMELESS album. i was SO excited about City of Evil, and unfortunately have been let down. but, i give it 4 stars because the evolution process A7X has fortaken is great. if you listen to the musicianship in the songs, you can hear the evolution. the only thing that brings the album down is Shadows vocals. it's not that bad, but since he injured his vocal cords, it seems that the band had to change their musical stylings to adjust to his voice. the heaviness that was Waking The Fallen has seemed to have lifted a bit on City of Evil. i am very impressed by the musicianship though, especially the drumming. even though Shadow's vocals do bring the record down a bit, after a few listens, i got used to it and found the hidden beauty in the album.
B000003S09|5.0|I normally try not to gush too much on these reviews, but this band just never ceases to amaze me. This disc is arguably the best rock debut ever. I bought it when it first came out--I was a young lad and I was drawn to the crazy cover art. I have played this record through countless times, and I still love the band today--all these metamorphoses later. \\"In the Court...\\", \\"Red\\", \\"Thrak\\" and the new \\"Power to Believe\\" are my favorites, but KC has never made a bad record, and \\"In the Court\\" is a classic; a must-have. I only wish there were more ensembles out there like this one.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I have NEVER like a SOAD song the first time I heard it.  But a strange thing starts to happen, all of their songs begin to grow on me until you need to hear them to survive, kinda like a psychotropic musical narcotic.  You also can't beat the political message, these guys hit the nail on the head when it comes to right-hating social commentary.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|okay... first off, i havent heard sounding the seventh trumpet... but i did buy waking the fallen... and the thing is, the reason i liekd it so much is because of the screaming and teh wailing... it was so awesome. he did a great job going from screaming til his lungs burst and then going to a melody, and now its liek the whole cd is liek way more mellow... i mean don't get me wrong its not bad... its much better than most of the sh*t at the warped tour... but with this cd, it sounds like all teh rest of them... im kind of disappointed.
B0001I562I|5.0|I just finished watching the end half of FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR on the Family Channel a few days ago... its the first time I've seen this great movie in years. When I was a kid age 3-7, I swear I must have made everyone in the household watch this movie like 100 times, this was probably one of my favorite movies next to Neverending story,Neverending story 2:The Next Chapter, The Witches, Willy Wonka, Goonies, Pee-Wee's big Adventure, Mannaquin, and Ghostbusters, ect.... Now I'm about to turn 21, and not too long ago when I got my tax return back I was walking around the video store and randomly out of impulse bought Neverending Story and Neverending Story 2: The Next Chapter, along with some other DVD's. To be honest I really expected that I just wasted money on a kid's film but it turns out they weren't that bad watching it so many years later and I'm actually glad I added it to my DVD collection. I'm thinking about doing the same for FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR.  <br />I think its hilarious because it was so long ago that I was an innocent little kid and now my entire movie collection consists of some of the most revolting horror films ever put on the big screen,(I'm a big Lucio Fulci/George A Romero/horror movie, gorehound. I've been waiting ever since I first saw Day of the Dead, for Romero to bring some closure to the Dead trilogy and now in 3 weeks Land of the Dead is finally hitting theaters June 25th!!) <br />So every time I look at my collection all I see is:(Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn, Night of the Living Dead, *NEVERENDING STORY*,*NEVERENDING STORY 2*,Faces of Death... and now Death,Death,*FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR*... but its all good, my friends always laugh when they look at my collection... Every once in awhile, I like to reminisce back to those times of innocence and purity.  <br />I apologize if this review is too general, but bottom line, I think every kid should watch this movie and embrace it like I did when I was that age, its one of those rare family movies like the Goonies that can still be appreciated 20 years later. Its amazing how well it still holds up and how amazing some of the visuals are in this movie. I personally believe that when someone is really young,its very important to expose them to  quality films and books that are deeply vivid, and imaginative, granted that they are G-PG rated, because as an artist I've notice that innocence is a catalyst for creativity, and open-mindedness,and open-mindedness is a cataylst for real wisdom, and sadly thats something that too many people loose when they grow up. I loved Flight of the Navigator soo much when I was younger when things were simple and if I have a kid that will probably be one of the first movies I put on for him to watch. Its like my friend just told me the other day; no matter what it is some movies just stick with you even when you get older, whether its bad or good you'll always have a soft spot for it in your heart. <br />
B000244EMO|5.0|Alright maybe not, it isnt star wars, but nonetheless, predator was one of my favorite movies along with Aliens. And, it honestly isnt that bad, aside from the blood and some of the language a kid could see this (i did). I saw this movie when i was only seven or eight and remember thinking when it was over, that the predator was the biggest bad ass ever, i instantly fell in love with the silent hunter. A must have movie for anyone
B0009OPO0S|5.0|I have been following her music since \\"Piez Descalsos\\"...she continues to amaze me with the variety of sounds she explores and her powerful lyrics as usual. It's awesome how open she is and isn't afraid to lay it all out there. This album contains a good mix of rock/dance/reggaeton/etc. WOW! I'm a huge Metallica fan and listen to plenty of other rock music - Shakira's lyrics almost always reach my heart and make me shed an occasional tear - even for a \\"rocker\\" like me.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|What a load of bulls**t, this dumb b***h calls herself a \\"punk\\" band, she doesnt even know what punk is. \\"Punk\\" is not dressing up in loose, torn clothing, wearing spikes, and riding your \\"sk8ter\\" boards, anyone one who even considers this remotely punk or even remotely rock should be banned to hell eternally. Having guitars and drums doesnt make a rock band, if u want some real punk listen to the clash, the ramones, bad religion, dead kennedys, the misfits, or the sex pistols.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I like this album a lot.  Considering the atmosphere and overall vibe of the album, I think its the best album since Awake.  The songs are well written, Rudess' synth patches are phat and analog sounding and contribute to the songs.  A nice change from the mutated trumpet and DonkeyKong noises that are prevalent on any release he's been on so far. <br /> <br />I thought TOT was good, but many of the songs were ruined by mindless wankery.  Its almost like John Petrucci and Jorden Rudess were trying to outdo eachother at every turn, disregarding the feel of the song in the process. <br /> <br />Octavarium is just opposite - the album is practically devoid of any interesting solos by Petrucci.  Kind of a let down, but I'd rather hear the spaciousness than more mindless machine gun picking.  I mean come on, sure its awesome and all that but it's just too much! Where's the soulful, tastefull shredding from albums like WDADU, I&W, and Awake? <br /> <br />I do like Octivarium, but after 6 albums its obvious - the Dream Theater of yesterday...the lyrically awesome, sonically amazing progressive metal band is not comming back guys.  I'd pay $100 for an album that kicked ass like Awake does, but Ill be keeping my money, because its not going to happen. <br /> <br />That is, unless Kevin Moore wants to re-join DT.:)
B00012FXAE|5.0|The movie Aliens itself has grown to become one of my most loved movies along with Star Wars (God thank you for George Lucas), but I remember seeing Aliens when I was only seven or eight years old in '97 or '98 on video and thinking it was the best movie ever created, ive seen Aliens at least fifteen times. The collectors edition comes with a seperate disc for interviews and features which are actually quite interesting, I watched them all, and the original movie and the new edition. A must have for any DVD collection, a timeless classic
B0008F113W|5.0|Since the remastering of Soul Of A New Machine, I was expecting Roadrunner to do the same with Demanufacture, and I was right on the money. This time they wanted to target this reissue towards the label's 25th anniversary, but nothing goes halfa**ed. Like SOAMN, it's remastered, there's new liner notes, and Remanufactured comes as a second disc, and it comes in a nice digipak. If you can't really tell the difference with remasters, maybe you're not listening. Only expect the full crushing sound that you got from when Demanufacture was first released, only now there's more.
0688172377|5.0|I like the book Desert Flower very much and you can learn so much of it about Female genital mutilation or other very important topics. <br />Waris Dirie is an admirable woman and I recommend the book to everyone! <br />Eerverbody should read this book once in the lifetime!
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey currently has the #1 album in America. With 1.7M copies sold in just 8 weeks, the \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\" has solidified her comeback. A flop? Not in this lifetime or the next. This album is terrific from start to finish. If you're a Mariah fan, don't hesitate to pick up her BEST album since \\"Butterfly.\\"
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Dream Theater's highly anticipated \\"Octavarium\\" takes a while to get used to. Unlike Train of Thought, this album is not really that heavy. There are only two real \\"Metal\\" songs - The Root Of All Evil and Panic Attack. These end up being two of the inevitable highlights of the album. Some songs like \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" and \\"I Walk Beside You\\" are so sappy, but you get used to them and start liking them. IWBY sounds similar to something U2 would write. The best song, Octavarium is 24 minutes long. Songs like \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" has Dream Theater going into different territory - about 9/11. <br />Overall, Octavarium needs time. Some songs need more time than others while some immediately capture your attention. For the most part, 8VM is a good album. Some songs are not as good as others. Some songs are very epic and epic-sounding, which is a plus. There is something for everyone here, as well as existing Dream Theater fans. I will give this album 5 stars, but I almost gave it 4. 4 1/2 stars.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is simply hypnotic. They've taken everything to another level. It's truly masterful. Words can't really describe how pleasantly surprised I am. The music just glides. It's smooth, vibrant, yet subtle. My favorite song right now is WHITE SHADOWS. \\"X&Y\\" has classic written allover it. I echo those that say it was worth the wait. Coldplay did not disappoint.
0767020308|5.0|I also first saw 1996's Emma prior to watching this one.  However late I was in arriving at viewing, I'm glad I was finally able to compare and contrast the two films and find this version truest to Austen's depicition of plot and characters.<br /><br />No offense to Jeremy Northam, but Mark Strong fit the role of Knightley to a tee. Yes, he was combative and argumentative, but this is how he was in Austen's book as well.  He might not have Northam's classically handsome silhouette but, to borrow an Austen phrase, he does possess a pair of hypnotic, 'fine eyes'. Strong and Beckinsale made for a wonderful on-screen pairing.<br /><br />Samantha Morton played Harriet Smith to a tee, but special kudos must go to Olivia Williams and Raymond Coulthard who brought spark and believability to their interpretations of Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill respectively - an element I found lacking in Miramax's release.  Bernard Hepton and Prunella Scales as Mr. Woodhouse and Miss Bates were secondary characters that were far better developed in Davies' film and much truer to how they were written on the page.<br /><br />Andrew Davies is a true interpreter of fine British literature. I only hope he might someday do the same for Austen's Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold pwns.  <br /> <br />I listened to 'Waking the Fallen' and 'Sounding of the Seventh Trumpet' about half  and half for the past half a year or so, so when i heard they had a new cd out, i got really excited. Before i heard the sample tracks they release before the album, i figured they would come with a rehash of 'Waking the Fallen' seeing as how sucessfull and what a great album it was. But my expectations were gladly shattered when i heard 'City of Evil'.  The guitar work is great, the drums are marvelous, and the vocal harmonies are glorious. Although it takes a little getting used to after 'Waking the Fallen', this is a glorious cd and is a good direction for them. <br /> <br />This is one of the few cds i can just sit down and listen to all the way through.
B0009AM5JA|5.0|There's a lot of CDs out there that you buy and need to play 3 times or so to like it or appreciate it later. I had hundrends of cds and I've experienced that a lot. However, when I played this cd the very first time, I was amazed right away and keep on playing several times. I was never amazed like this before. The best cd I have. This is my kind of music.<br />Yes, it is copyrighted, however, you can make another copy of this cd by saving it first to your itunes library or even the windows media player, and then, you can burn it to blank cd. You cannot copy this thru cd to cd.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I've had this album for a day now, so my opinion on it overall might change as time goes on. I can already say this is a worthy DT CD though, and I easily recommend it to any fan of good music. <br />  The songs that hit me right away were The Root Of All Evil, These Walls, Sacrificed Sons, and the monster title track Octavarium. This song is the epic, and at 24 min. it requires repeated listening. The beginning part really reminded me of Pink Floyd. I did hear influences throughout this album, such as Pink Floyd, U2, Muse, and others. <br />  This is a Dream Theater album though, and it has its own distinction, and it's always awesome to hear any new material by them. It's definitely not TOT, lighter overall. I found it had a sort of mix of Falling Into Infinity, Awake, and 6 Degrees Of Inner Turbulence. <br />  In conclusion, if you like DT at all you'll like this album. It has all the ingredients that make DT as good as they are and is more consistent than than the last couple albums. <br />4 and a half stars
B0006L16N8|5.0|It took a couple of listens, but I can't get enough of this album.  I think that it represents an evolution from their last album, rather than a revolutionary or experimental makover, but, hey, look how far Radiohead went downhill when they tried that.  The more I listen to this album, the more the \\"hooks\\" get drilled into my consciousness.  Overall, a very impressive, sonically rich effort.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Go this cd yesterday like everyone else and was not at all disappointed.  You've already read that track 1 is the 3rd instalment of MP's AA songs.  Same musical themes as the first two.  Too many reviewers have already gone through all the songs.  So I won't.  I will say that I've been a DT fan for years, since WDADU.  All of their albums are great but this one is up there on the list.  FYI, I also got the new Porcupine Tree - Deadwing - this cd is equally amazing.  SImilar but different than DT.  Actually the PT may even be better than Octavarium.  Buy both!
B0006L16N8|5.0|this is the best record i've heard since pink floyd's \\"dark side of the moon.\\"    it's so damn good, it almost makes me cry...    just get it...  no hesitation, no second thought.   it is truly awesome and stunningly beautiful.    you're in for a real treat.    edited and added:    Sublime&Divine    Once in a great while, a work of art of such beauty, grandeur, virtuosity... is created such that it leaps beyond all judgment, preference or personal opinion. It has that ineffable, intangible \\"thing\\" beyond its obvious perfection.    Michaelangelo's \\"Hand of God,\\" Mozart's \\"Requiem,\\" Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall,\\" U2's \\"Achtung Baby,\\" Radiohead's \\"Ok Computer,\\"... (you get the picture...) are all like that.    Well, Coldplay's \\"X&Y\\" has just earned itself an eternal place among such incontrovertible masterpieces. This record simply leaves you awestruck and speechless. It has that indescribable mystical beauty that catches you off guard and penetrates your soul before you realize what is happening. Then, it brings tears to your eyes and sends chills down your spine. By the time it's over, you know beyond doubt that you've been lifted up to the sky and, just for a moment, seen the face of God.     (I had meant to address the criticism and the low-star ratings I've seen here, but i cannot even bring myself to degrade such spiritually pure work of art by acknowledging the ill-will and ignorance of some who either have an agenda or are hard of hearing. I fully realize that all are entitled to whatsoever opinion, but bringing Mr. Martin's family into a record review is tasteless if not malevolent, and at the very least, completely irrelevant.)    Thank you Coldplay for this sublime and divine gift you have given us. All blessings to you.    --Maya
B000002KIE|3.0|Read most of the reviews here and you'd assume the most important thing about the band is:<br /><br />A) If they held/hold the \\"right\\" political views<br />B) Whether they were or weren't a \\"manufactured\\" band<br />C) Whether they're technically proficient or not<br /><br />That's why I hate reading punk rock reviews: stupid arguments over who's a \\"poser\\" and who's not. (To be fair, heavy metal and indie rock are just as full of morons arguing about this garbage.) There's only ONE important thing about ANY band: How good's their music?<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />\\"No Feelings\\" is an incisive dig at self-promoting religious leaders (\\"I love yer mortal sin/Yer brains are locked away/But I love your company..\\") \\"God Save the Queen\\" is a political barb that actually works. I don't see it as a plea for anarchy so much as a poke at the near deity some want to assign to the \\"royals\\" and the distraction they serve as from what the government in Britain is actually doing. \\"Seventeen\\", though, is probably the most believable \\"statement of purpose\\" for the band:\\"I don't work,I just speed/That's all I need/I'm a lazy sod..\\". \\"Pretty Vacant\\" is a pointed attack on superficiality.<br /><br />LOWS:<br />Is \\"Bodies\\" a bad pro-life song..or a clever anthem for the uneasy middle? At first Lydon sings \\"She don't wanna baby that looks like that\\" which seems to be a straightforward indictment of the girl who wants an abortion because the baby's deformed or the \\"wrong\\" colour (implied). But then in the next line it becomes \\"*I* don't wanna baby that looks like that\\". For the most part the band seem to be demonizing \\"Pauline\\", so I'm gonna come down on the side of \\"badly written pro-life polemic\\". The ridiculous words to \\"Liar\\" make the Castaways oldie seem profound. \\"Problems\\" and \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" are standard issue \\"I hate everything..everyone else is conformist\\" blather. \\"New York\\" is a musical middle finger to the New York Dolls.(\\"And you're acting flash/With nothing in your gut\\") See my comments above re:\\"poser\\" arguments. Ditto \\"E.M.I.\\"<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />80 billion rock critics have proclaimed this as the most influential signpost in the punk rock movement. (Others can argue about if it's \\"real\\" punk. That argument is pointless. It all comes down to \\"sez you!\\" in the end.) Plenty of artists point to this as one that inspires them so I won't argue that point.<br /><br />But \\"influential\\" and \\"great\\" are two different things and this album didn't inspire me, move me emotionally, or thrill me in the way that hearing ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?,JOHNNY CASH AT FOLSOM PRISON,PET SOUNDS, REVOLVER, or LIVE AT THE APOLLO for the first time did.

B0000ADY9I|5.0|I am a pretty experienced ABB listener and and have listened to three different versions of At The Fillmore East. This is definitely the best available and is one of the best live album ever recorded. If you like the Allman Brothers, Blues-Rock or Southern Rock BUY THIS ALBUM. There are no bad songs or filler. Yeah the songs are long but not drawn out, dont confuse the two, every minute is intense. This is the pioneers of Southern Rock, the White Kings of the Blues and some of the best musicians in the history of rock at their peak and in their complete element. A lot, if not all, of the songs on this album were available on previous albums becasue theyre arguably the best live versions of these songs recorded. This album was compiled of 4 performances at the Fillmore over one weekend. This is the only place where you can get them all at once (trust me Ive looked, no Ive scoured). This deluxe edition is essentially a Greatest Hits album of their 1971 material from the Fillmore. Its as close as you can come to being there. Pick this album up and then go to a Brothers concert, you can thank me later.
B000268QB2|5.0|To sum it up, this album is well worth the purchse. For Keane's first release, it definitely impresses. I initially bought it after falling in love with &quot;Somewhere only we know&quot;. But since purchasing the album. I constantly find myself humming along to the tunes of &quot;This is the last time.&quot; You can easily say that all the songs are great, minus one or two. There is no guitarist, but that doesn't detract away from the completeness of the songs. Although often compared to Coldplay, I personally find Keane's vocalist Tom Chaplin better than Chris Martin. The songs are also easily more attractive and memorable than those produced by Coldplay. Other recommended tracks include &quot;Bend and Break&quot;, &quot;We Might As Well be Strangers&quot;, &quot;Bedshaped&quot;, and &quot;She Has No Time&quot;.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|i have been a fan of a7x since sounding the seventh trumphet and i gotta say this cd proves all their talent. In this cd you will hear a lot more of what every musician has to offer especialy the drummer. I will say i think that waking the fallen might put this one below it still, even though this cd is so amazingly incredible. in a few songs they even bring some cool acoustics in which has not been done by them before. City Of Evil is a MUST BUY so go out there and buy it; and do like i will and cheer them on at the warped tour.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I don't know which is worse - Coldplay's corporate risk free reproduction of Rush Of Blood To The Head or Radiohead's total reinvention after OK Computer. <br />A mix of the two would be nice - some risks coupled with some tunes. <br />Coldplay have opted for the safe bet and the fans should vote with their feet.Unfortunately, this is going to be a massive seller
B0009A1AS2|3.0|His review is darn near perfect- But- Sacrificed sons is a 4/5- The 1st two songs are hidious (1st track- boring 4/4 rock-2nd track- cliche- cornball lyrics)- The rest of the album is good- 3 stars fits perfectly!!!
B00004VVNB|3.0|In a future world, all your needs are taken care of...until you turn 31. Then it's all over and you get \\"recycled\\". People are offered a sort of lottery in which they can be \\"renewed\\" through a process called \\"lottery\\" but it is a sham. Nobody makes it. The other alternative is to run. That's where the Sandmen come in. They chase down and kill the runners. <br /> <br />Logan is a Sandman. He is assigned to track down vague rumors of \\"Sanctuary\\" by posing as a runner himself. The problem is that he gets gypped out of his last four years to make it creditable. Logan runs himself and is in turn chased by a sandman. The majority of the film concerns his run and escape to Sanctuary. This leads Logan and his decorative companion outside the domes of the city and into the real world. It is an eye opening experience. <br /> <br />This was a very popular film in its day but I never saw it until recently. Now, I have to wonder what all the hype was about. The acting is not too great and the story line is not too much better. It keeps attention but barely manages to do so. <br />
B0000TB05A|5.0|Stumbled upon this DVD in a jewel case not really sure what to make of it initially. Once I got home and put it first in my computer it wasn't very long afterwards that I had to have the full effect of the living room stereo setup. What an amazing concert! Ive seen them live but this was really special, considering the circumstances(his fathers passing, Irelands win in World Cup) had made everything align for a magical night. It is superbly done, capturing one of the great rock bands at its best. Also recommended if you liked this is \\"U2 at Red Rocks\\" and a recent tour caught in Mexico City(Pop Tour?). Anyway if you like U2 you will love this concert, check it out!
B0008F113W|5.0|I got Demanufacture about 3 years ago,and it still stays in regular rotation when im in in the car, at home, or work, and i never get sick of it, my original copy has seen some better times and i don't own remanufacture, so i figured id pony up the bucks and get the 25 anniversary edition, which is apparently remastered (i cant tell, and its worth it, i love this album dammit.
B0006L16N8|4.0|This one is great.  It is hard not to compare it to their first two releases, but try not to.  There is so much more going on here.  Sweeping melodies, beautiful chorus', playful lyrics, all in all a great experience.   <br />Think about this one as the icing on the cake.  It doesn't have the raw nature of Parachutes or the instant hook that some of the singles from AROBTTH had, but there is so much more present.  I'm on my 5th listen and am still discovering new levels to what is going on here.  Get into your car, start driving, and play this CD at full volume.
B000002H33|5.0|This album was released during the glory days of thrash metal. Back when it was cool for guys to perm their hair and when black jeans were cool (Now only nerdy guys wear black jeans, and they tuck their t-shirts into their jeans, what's the go with that???). This CD needs to have its name inscribed into the ancient stones that contain the authoritative canon of all time greatest Heavy Metal Albums right at the very top above all others. <br /> <br />The music on this album is grand, carefully orchestrated thrash metal, emotive and powerful, oppressively heavy for its day but with enough substance to carry its reputation into the universal realm of classic album status. The greatest endorsement that this album has is that when i was 13 and getting into it, the album was already several years old and kids my age still loved it. Now i am 25 and the 13 year olds are still discovering it and loving it with no cue from us oldies.  <br /> <br />I had the opportunity to see Metallica at the Big Day Out in Sydney over a year and a half ago now and hearing the song Master of Puppets live was the most incredible experience to behold. Not a single other of their songs with the possible exception of One came even close to flooring me as completely as Master Of Puppets.  <br /> <br />Anyway you probably dont need to read this review. You already know it is a great album and you already intend to buy it. I guess it is more my testament to a great album that will never die.
B00005JMEW|1.0|What are you people smoking?  This movie had nothing; it just plain stunk.  Okay, Pulp Fiction was decent in a quirky way, but is that all this director can do?  Enough with the quirk, give me some acting, a good story, and believable characters.  I made it only half through this nonsense.  The good news I won't have to bore myself with Kill Bill 2.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|My initial impression of this album was abject disappointment. I spent two weeks waiting oh, so patiently for this album to be released after i heard B.Y.O.B on Triple J. The anticipation was killing me, i was counting down the number of sleeps, i even went to a number of record stores a day early to see if anyone had broken the release date, without luck. <br /> <br />Finally the big day arrived and i picked it up as quickly as i could. I went straight back to my car and put it in for a spin. What the...? With trepidation i glanced at my Girlfriend to see her expression during each track. Initially her face told me that  she was confused... this is some bizarre crap we are listening to, honey. Then it turned to revulsion... Finally, the coup de grace that told me that this was a total loser of an album, the bored, can we put NIN's back on face.  <br /> <br />This album seemed like a bag of ill-digested trinkets that had been regurgitated by an overwieght, intellectually challenged drug mule with ulcers. Okay, i know that sounds harsh but that was indeed my first impression. Everyone on the websites had been raving about the amazing new vocal harmonies. All i heard were a pair of dudes who had taken way too many drugs and had totally lost the plot. <br /> <br />So, anyway, i reverted to listening to this album secretly on my discman on the way to work so my girlfriend wouldn't notice (I couldnt face the shame). And surprise, surprise i began to like it. Really like it. These dudes rock like no tomorrow and the album now sends me into a crazed, head-shaking frenzy of reckless abandon.  <br /> <br />The point of this review is that if you have heard the sound bites and don't like what you hear, buy it and listen to it anyway. You may just be surprised...
B0002DB52M|1.0|I didn't even wait long enough to see Nicole on screen - that's how bad this artsy-fartsy farce was.  Save your time and money.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I am a Trent Reznor fan from way back and yes I do think that Pretty Hate Machine and The Downward Spiral were the ultimate expressions of his pure genius. But that does not mean that With Teeth is a piece of worthless trash that he should be ashamed of.  <br /> <br />So what if he hasn't done anything mind-blowing or totally new and original since the apex of his career. How many artists can you tell me that have totally redifined themselves while remaining within the confines of the box of style that everyone knows and loves them for. And before you start rattling a long list of artists that have, think about how many sub-par albums those artists created before they achieved their second coming. <br /> <br />The missing point seems to be that a sub-par album from a great artist is still a whole load better than a heap of 'good' albums from the guagmire of crap bands that somehow manage to exist and sell albums at any one moment in time. So please no more of that 'If i wanted to here the same old stuff again i would listen to Pretty Hate Machine not With Teeth' rubbish. <br /> <br />This album has some fine songs on it. 'You Know What You Are' has a totally awesome beat that knocks me flat. I take guilty, whiny pleasure in the lyrics to 'All the Love in The World' and 'Everyday is Exactly the Same'. 'Only' is like a new wave/post-punk song on bad acid which totally rocks and 'The Hand The Feeds' is one catchy tune that will etch itself into your sub-conscious like a pleasant kind of itch that feels alluringly, sensual to scratch. Each song feels like it was a love-child of Reznor's that he has labored for long and hard. <br /> <br />Get over your disappointment about it not being a masterpiece and enjoy it for what it is, a collection of lovingly created songs.
B0006L16N8|4.0|How you'll feel about this album all depends on what you're expecting. Naturally, with the smashing success of Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head, Coldplay was standing in very firm footing for the release of their third full length album. I will admit that I was not a Coldplay fan from day one, though I do recall hearing Yellow once on the radio a long time ago during driver's ed and instantly loving the song, though I never caught the name of the band until much later. I have gradually become a fairly large fan of their work, though my greatest attentions are placed on the Smashing Pumpkins, Aimee Mann, the Decemberists, and the work of Yoko Kanno. Anyways, I digress. X&Y is excellent in most every way. For one, the craftmanship of the album is top notch, with each of the musicians playing without fault and with great intelligence. The smashing guitar is still there along with driving piano chords, thumping bass lines, and heavy, smooth drum rhythms. X&Y is exactly what you'd expect from a band as secure and powerful as Coldplay: more of the same. The same great hooks and the same great song construction is still in wide use with the band, and I listened to the entire disc in one sitting without finding a track I didn't like. The only issue, and the reason the album loses a star, is that innovation is simply not present. I would have liked to hear something adventurous from the band, but this is the same Coldplay people have loved from day one, only with new lyrics, music, and sonic choices to give them a slightly more tidy sound. I have to say that Speed of Sound is extremely reminiscent of Clocks in the opening riff and the time and rhythm stuctures of the song. However, Clocks is a great song, and so is Speed of Sound, along with Fix You and Swallowed in the Sea, which are two of the most emotional and deep tracks of the new album. They're definitely worth a few spins, even to a casual Coldplay fan. If you're a Coldplay fan hoping to pick up X&Y and hear something new from the band, you'll be dissappointed. However, if you're looking to find more great tracks that sound like Coldplay (to use the name as an adjective), then you'll likely be very pleased with X&Y, as I am.<br /><br />Bottomline: If you love Coldplay, you'll love X&Y. If you're expecting to hear something new, you'll be dissappointed. Coldplay fans rejoice.r something new from the band, you'll be dissappointed. However, if you're looking to find more great tracks that sound like Coldplay (to use the name as an adjective), then you'll likely be very pleased with X&Y, as I am.

0671004107|5.0|For those who loved the movie, you should have read the book first- and then you'd have hated the movie.  The movie's ending was anti-climactic, whereas the last page of the novel presents one of the most mind-boggling concepts I have ever encountered- a picture built into a number.  And not just any picture! I found this to be a genuinely moving book- a distinct rarity in the science fiction world.  And for the lost soul who rated the book a \\"1\\" because Carl is an \\"atheist\\"- you totally missed the point of the book!  Like Einstein, Carl was an agnostic- but he was profoundly and deeply \\"religious,\\" in his way, as the ending of the book makes so clear.  Carl's reverence and concern for this planet and for its future generations should qualify him for sainthood, in any religion.  As Carl said of Euclid's Geometry, this book is \\"a great read.\\"
B00006L6YG|5.0|I'm sorry, friends, after twenty years of listening, buying hundreds of CD's and an improved stereo I now know CD's don't have enough bits. They don't capture all the sound that was in the original vinyl recordings. 44k and 2 to the 14th power was NOT enough samples (bits). Like looking at an old newspaper picture made out of large dots, it's not like a photo. Like a primitive digital print without enough pixels. Poor resolution.<br /><br />With 4 times as many time slices (increments) in the x direction and 2 to the 8th power, 256 more bits (increments) in the Y direction, this SACD is the only format which really captures the sound of the original LP or master tape. You cannot hear the difference between this and the LP. It's the real thing.<br /><br />If you thought CD's sound harsh, or bass-thin, not like a concert, well, you were right!<br /><br />Beyond that, this album is the second best selling Jazz album of all time, behind Miles Davis \\"Kind of Blue\\". A timeless classic of the early sixties. \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" was in the top ten songs on the Rock, Pop and Jazz Billboard charts for over a year in the '63-'64 time frame.<br /><br />Yeah it's really that good!<br /><br /> Hear Stan the Man effortlessly pour out his soul in the bridge of \\"Corcovado\\", for example. As a personal note, this was the first Jazz LP I ever bought, as a clarinet and sax player myself, I couldn't believe how good Stan Getz tone was. And I still love it.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|People have been giving this movie either 5 star or 1 star reviews, but to be honest, the movie cannot be put into either extreme.  It's middle of the road action/horror fare. <br /> <br />Keanu Reeves has somewhat wooden acting, but anyone who's seen a Keanu Reeves movie will tell you that wooden acting is simply how he does things, and in that respect, this is one of his better depictions of a character since Ted Theodore Logan.  His character is one confronted with his own fate and hates everything for it, and anyone who saw the movie must have seen that in Keanu's performance.  If you say it was stiff, well, yeah it was a little stiff, but this is not meant to be an award-winning drama.  This is an action movie, and the acting always comes off a little stiff in action movies. <br /> <br />Some of the other characters and plot devices, I'll admit are a bit cheezy, but no more so than in any other action movie (people who disagree are advised to view any Arnold, Stalone, or Willis movie ever made).  So if you're one to toot your horn and scream that the movie was contrived at the top of your lungs, then maybe you should stop to consider that the message the movie was trying to give was not about religion, but rather \\"battling demons looks cool, and deus ex machina, while contrived, provides for a fun change of pace to an action movie.\\" <br /> <br />So in the end don't take this movie for more (or less) than what it is.  It's an action film about killing demons starring Keanu Reeves, with decent effects, a pretty good supporting cast, and a pseudo twist ending loosely based on a comic book character.  For anyone who's read the comic, you must realize that it isn't exactly bursting with action.  In that respect maybe you can see why it deviated so much from the source material.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When this show first started airing on TV, people were hyping it up on the sole reason that it was a \\"Joss Whedon\\" show.  Being neither a big Buffy nor Angel fan, this told me nothing, and I let the entire short run on Fox pass me by. <br /> <br />Having only been introduced to this series a few months ago, I have fallen in love with it.  The setting is robust, even if the episodes ocassionally have moments of trying to find their own place (a blatant X-files like reference in one episode that is never repeated stands out as one).  Some of the best episodes invole the wackiest situations (Jaynestown and Our Mrs. Reynolds being 2 of the best episodes), but they all shine as great episodes on their own. <br /> <br />The characterization is great, the store gripping, and the concept engaging.  Overall, this series is well worth the $40 I paid for it a few months ago. <br /> <br />Finally, a parting note about the upcoming movie \\"Serenity\\" - if you liked the series you'll LOVE the movie.  It continues on with the store of the crew of Serenity and tells the in depth story of River (played by Summer Glau) and why she is chased by the galactic government known as the Alliance.  I would highly suggest seeing at least some of the episodes on this DVD before seeing the movie.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I was lucky enough to hear their cd an entire week before it was released. Since then, I haven't been able to stop listening. For those of you who may be slightly disenchanted with their first single \\"Speed of Sound,\\" do not be too quick to make conclusions about the entire album. There are no weak numbers on the album, and, if anything, I would say that Speed of Sound is my least favorite.  <br /> <br />I loved \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"Rush of Blood to the Head.\\" However, I would say that \\"X & Y\\" is even better than Coldplay's amazing two previous albums.  <br /> <br />Chris Martin's voice is beautiful as always, the lyrics are heartfelt and genuine, and the piano and guitar rifts are powerful. I highly recommend this item.
B00003CXAT|2.0|I give the movie itself a huge 5, but the Collector's Edition DVD a 2.  I was disappointed as soon as I opened it.  It had a space for one of those paper inserts, but there was nothing there.  What kind of a collector's edition is this?  In any case, I'm very glad I have the DVD, because I have watched my VHS copy about 200 times.  Jurassic Park is my favorite movie of all time and I would encourage you to buy it!
B0000CAXIC|5.0|I would have to say this album is the best of the Foo.  I would have never thought I would be so into them untill this album came out.  My wife became a huge Dave Grohl fan because of this one.  When we went to see them on this tour, it was one of the best concerts I have been to.  Watching Dave and Taylor battle it out on drums was awesome.  And this album shows so much emotion.  It seems they let out a little steam and some happiness through out the album.  Not only would I recommend it, but I would recommend the Foo Fighters in general.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this album is very, very good--it is, however, different in some important ways from their other two studio albums. <br /> <br />First, the sound is bigger--way bigger--this is an \\"arena album\\"; when they come to the states to support it this summer, people who go to the shows are in for a real treat.   <br /> <br />The first track, \\"square one\\", starts with a Pink Floyd-like intro, highlighting Martin's vocals against a backdrop of echoing synthesizer sounds before a brief drum beat, almost dance-like, takes over for a moment, then BANG--they hit you with the guitar progression and expansion of the vocal track that drives the song forward--awfully good. <br /> <br />The album as a whole is more guitar-driven than previous Coldplay efforts, though elements of Chris at the piano still exist, most notably in the first half of \\"what if\\". <br /> <br />\\"Speed of sound\\" is definitely the radio cut on the album, and, though good, is actually one of the weaker songs.  Ironically, it is also probably the most like \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush...\\".  \\"X & Y\\", the song that precedes it, has the most catchy melody since \\"Yellow\\" and \\"In My Place\\"--I'll be surprised if it isn't the next radio track. <br /> <br />Overall, it reminds me a bit of U2, not so much in sound, but style--big, robust--it demands something from you like great music does...  They've clearly kept us waiting for good reason; buy this album, you won't be disappointed.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Genial, magnfico. Acabo de escuchar el disco completo y la primera impresin que tengo es que es una obra de culto: refinada, intensa, urgente, elegante, sincera, hipnotizante y cautivante. <br /> <br />X & Y me ha dejado con una muy buena impresin, no slo es el disco con ms canciones que han sacado (13 incluyendo el track oculto), sino el ms completo y de mejor calidad de todos. Todas las canciones son geniales, las melodas son nicas, algo completamente apartado de la superficialidad musical reinante en el ambiente musical hoy en da, y que, lamentablemente, tambin ha tocado a bandas que antes eran pioneras e innovadoras como U2 u Oasis.  <br /> <br />Generalmente cuando se habla de madurez musical se tiende a hablar de grupos que han dejado atrs la pasin, la honestidad y la energa para llegar a un producto de ms fcil consumo. No es el caso de X & Y, ya que es un disco ms complicado que A Rush Of Blood To The Head, y por lo mismo, ms extrao e inquietante. <br /> <br />S que es un tanto apresurado decir que va a ser el disco del ao, pero algo s es seguro: este es el mejor trabajo que Coldplay han sacado a la venta. <br /> <br />Con este disco Coldplay dejan en claro una cosa: Las 3 mejores bandas que reinan el planeta son Radiohead, Coldplay y Keane.  <br /> <br />PD: Espero que los rumores que dicen que Coldplay vendra a Chile en Diciembre sean ciertos y tengamos la oportunidad de verlos en tierras Chilenas.
B0006L16N8|2.0|God- <br /> <br />Four babies banging on Pots is better than this crap.  Take my advice, go buy \\"THE BIZ\\" by The Sea & Cake
B00012FXAE|2.0|I just don't get it. Why are they sending a woman into space? I'm a proud female and I was always taught that the main duties of women include cooking, making sure the family is content, making clothes and avoiding the work force. So just who does Ripley think she is?? A man?? Uh nooo... but that's not the only reason I give this movie such a low score. The story was boring and aliens were just way too disgusting for me. I also just didn't connect with it. Nothing like this could ever happen. Totally unbelievable. If you want to watch a worthwhile movie, check out Crossroads.
B00006IU73|5.0|About two years ago, I heard 'Blackest Eyes,' this phenomenal album's opener, on an internet radio station and instantaneously fell in love with PT. It took me a long time to find a copy of this record, but when I finally did, it took me an equally long time to truly 'get into it.' It wasn't an immediate thing for me, despite the fact that I really did like everything I heard. For an impossibly lengthy time, I couldn't get into the second half of it at all, but after many attempts, I finally began to understand and embrace what I'd missed before. And now it has become my favourite record of all time. <br /> <br />This album...is not an easy listen. I've probably heard it in excess of a hundred times, and it still disquiets for several reasons, not least of which is its sheer awesomeness. The purity of the sound on the album - it's consistently enveloping and really leaves me speechless. Steven Wilson, head guru of Porcupine Tree, is one of music's greatest producers, in addition to reigning supreme in the guitar/lyric/synth/basically-every-instrument departments. It's pretty obvious that In Absentia was a crucial thing for him, as every tiny little fragment of his skills both as producer and as musician was utilised in its gestation. <br /> <br />The heaviness here shouldn't be mistaken for 'selling out'; it never struck me as such, and most other PT fans feel the same. SW's merely adding to the already-rich palette of sounds he's clearly capable of mastering. 'Heavy' songs like 'Blackest Eyes', 'Strip the Soul', and 'Creator Had A Mastertape' are all wrapped up in layers, and I don't exclusively mean aural ones: this entire CD invokes the strangest range of emotions ever experienced in the course of 65 minutes (even the instrumental, the metallic snarl of 'Wedding Nails', manages to contribute to this). The lyrics are easily as weighty as the music - it's generally recognised that the words are the ramblings of a serial killer, making IA a bit of a hidden concept album. Moments of beauty are resplendent throughout the record as well; try not to cry while listening to 'Collapse the Light Into Earth,' easily one of the most heartbreakingly gorgeous songs ever written. 'Lips of Ashes' and 'Heartattack in a Layby' are also mindbogglingly lovely, made all the better by their damn-near angelic vocal harmonies, all orchestrated with amazing brilliance. Songs like 'Trains', 'Gravity Eyelids', and 'The Sound of Muzak' are so multilateral that they each warrant individual listenings, twisting with loud and soft parts and endlessly fascinating. 'Prodigal' even seems a throwback to the less serious days of the early Porcupine Tree, around the OTSOL era, with its bemused study of redunancy; '.3' also seems reminiscent of that time, but this is because of its trancey ambience instead. <br /> <br />All in all, I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music that requires more than three brain cells to fully appreciate. If listeners take the time to unveil the intricate perfection of In Absentia, they may find that PT are truly among the finest bands to walk the Earth in these modern, good-music-starved times, and that this record is more than enough to prove it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|So much better than 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb' and they recorded and released it so close. Edge sounds great playing his old style guitar signature. Nice to hear the Eno strings in the background again just like in '...Streets Have No Name'. And Bono... wait... where is Bono... ohhhh... this isnt U2?!?     Sorry I was very mistaken...     ... still, a very good album. Probably the best of the year so far. I am a U2 fan and an occasional Oasis fan - this blows Oasis's new album out of the water!     TALK and A MESSAGE are stand out tracks upon my first few listens here.     Cheers
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Down right funny and misguided horror film that manages to not only lack common sense for some of the stuff that it has in the script but manages to insult the audience with some of the worse dialog ever written for a mainstream movie. Keanu Reeves is painfully miscast, as the hero in this film and his performance is almost as bad as the dialog in this film. You don't take his character seriously at all and you just have to make fun of him during the course of the film because of how bad his performance really is. You don't know if he is putting you on with his performance or he is really taking his role seriously which is in fact a even bigger crime that just a bad performance. He is easily upstage by the great performance of Rachel Weisz, who seem like she was working on a better film other than the movie you were watching and you hoped that the film would automatically change to see that film because her performance is literally too good for this film, which is the biggest crime of all because you would end up wishing that you could just spent some time with her character instead of watching the garbage that is right in front of you. Peter Stormare is fine but he's not in the film at all really and his character is the second best character in the whole film right next to Weisz's.  His interpretation of the devil is quite original but he is reduce to a few minutes of screen time while we have to suffer with Keanu playing hero and a cast of characters that should have been drastically cut down because a few of them don't serve a purpose at all in this film.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for brainless entertainment, I suggest you rent something other than this because brainless entertainment is at least entertaining. This movie is only held together by a great performance of Rachel Weisz and a great character performance by Peter Stormare, who should have been more of a lead than Keanu was.  <br />
0783226845|5.0|A little long, but still a very enjoyable movie; capped off with a wonderful performance from the always-dependable and masterful Al Pacino <br /> <br />Charlie (Chris O'Donnell) knows who participated in a practical joke on headmaster Trask, but can't decide whether to snitch or not.  He is given the opportunity to think it over during the Thanksgiving weekend, and it is during this weekend that he decides to take a deceptively simple job house-sitting the retired and blind Col. Frank Slade (Pacino).  However, Charlie finds his situation is complicated by Slade's decision to go to New York for the weekend and intention to have a good time before \\"blowing [his] brains out\\".   <br /> <br />Al Pacino FINALLY won the Best Actor Oscar for his role as the blind and abrasive Col. Frank Slade in Martin Brest's \\"Scent of a Woman.\\"  It is one of his best performances, and he rightly deserved an Oscar for it (especially after being snubbed by the Academy for his even better performances in The Godfather I and II and \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\").  Pacino makes the foul-mouthed and abrasive Col. Slade into someone sympathetic and even lovable.  Much of this comes from Pacino's natural charm, but his performance never becomes too sentimental, which is admirable.  Also, Pacino plays a blind man very convincingly, and he did it without cheating (i.e. wearing sunglasses, wearing contacts, etc.).  It really is a masterful performance.   <br /> <br />Although the movie could have easily been shortened by half an hour, this film has its (many) delightful moments.  Perhaps the best scene in the film is Col. Slade's awkward but really beautiful tango with Donna (the gorgeous Gabrielle Anwar).  The mere premise of a blind man, who feels spiritually dead, tangoing and laughing and having a great time with a beautiful young lady is hypnotic, in a way.  You'll have to see it to know what I mean.  (The music to which they tango is also lovely.)  Other fantastic scenes that really showcase Pacino's acting include his appearance at the family dinner, the scene where he learns to drive a Ferrari, and the scene at the hotel where he decides to blow his brains out.  Even in the quieter moments, as when Pacino says goodbye to Charlie and feels his face, the mere gestures make this movie even better.   <br /> <br />In addition, the dialogue is often coarse and witty.  Col. Slade's trademark \\"Hoo-Hah!\\" is hilarious.  His musings on women and cars are bitingly funny.  The only problems I have with the movie are its length (as mentioned before, it could have been shortened rather easily without losing too much) and the ending, at Charlie's disciplinary hearing, which feels too rushed.  Nevertheless, it is a very enjoyable movie, and Pacino fans can't miss this one.   4.5/5
0790732254|5.0|After a party a college professor, George (played by Richard Burton\\" learns that his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) invited a young couple over to their home for a nightcap. The young couple  (played by Sandy Dennis and George Segal) are new to the college, Segal's character having just having received an appointment there. <br /> <br />The new comers are in for an evening that they (and the viewer) will never forget. <br /> <br />George has been a professor at the college for years - a disappointment to his wife and his father in-law the president of the college he is over the hill and feeling his age. His wife Martha is loud, promiscuous and an alcoholic. <br />And so when the young couple finally arrive the games begin.  <br />Straight off Martha and George trade witty banter and insults while their guests look on as if they stepped into some theatre of the absurd.  <br /> <br />As insults and liquor  continue to flow George and Martha draw their guests into their rough games. <br /> <br />Masters of mind control of  the North during the Korean War have nothing on George and Martha as secrets are revealed and emotion is stripped to the bare bone. <br /> <br />The story takes place over an evening  but it seems like a life time. <br /> <br />Burton and Taylor are brilliant in this  emotionally violent movie. <br />Although it is rough it is entertaining, sometimes profound and sometimes very very  funny. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Jim Connell   \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Rather disappointing - dry dialogue, some terrible casting, screws over Homer's story, visually unexciting    People who have never read Homer's classic story may not be miffed, but as an ardent admirer of the play, I found the movie unfulfilling, unexciting, somewhat dull, and marred by inconsistencies, terrible acting, and bland dialogue.  Also, the movie completely alters the nature of several death scenes (or eliminates the death scenes altogether), which will bother people who enjoy the play.  The movie focuses much more on Achilles and his own troubles/relationships than it does on Helen and the war fought for her.      Casting Helen of Troy is pretty tricky, especially when people will have such high expectations of her beauty.  Diane Kruger, while pretty, failed to meet my expectations as a woman of enough captivating beauty and personality to launch ten thousand ships.  Her bland acting and monotone delivery makes her even more unattractive, and I could feel nothing between her and Paris.  Orlando Bloom looks the part of Paris - young, nave, pretty-boy - but his acting is nearly as bad as Kruger's.  He is totally unconvincing in all of his scenes.  Other supporting characters, like Hector (Eric Bana), King Priam (Peter O'Toole), and Odysseus (Sean Bean), are excellent in their few scenes, saving the movie from being a complete dud.  Also, much commotion has been made of Brad Pitt's naked behind, and it's a very nice-looking one, but frankly, I am a bit scornful of his performance as Achilles.  He certainly looks the part, but I can't believe how corny he made his lines sound!  This is too bad, because Pitt is normally a pretty great actor.      However, the corniness of his delivery may be partially blamed on the terrible dialogue.  A line like \\"Immortality!  Seize it, it's yours!\\" is only one of the many very bad, cheesy lines in this movie, and the movie consequently plays out too soap-opera-ish and too...superficial.  There is none of the human pathos (with the exception of Peter O'Toole's scene) that is present in abundance in Homer's story.  The movie is also visually unexciting.  The CGI is overblown and uninteresting; it looks so artificial and grandiose that, instead of being \\"epic\\", it looks rushed and childish.  To the movie's credit, though, there are some good fight scenes, notably the one between Achilles and Hector.  It is also probably the best because real actors are employed, not computer-generated troops.      Worth a rental, I suppose, but don't expect too much.  And probably don't watch it if you are a fan of Homer's books.  2.5/5.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Thanks to the relentless punch of the publicity machine, we all know that Coldplay now has a new album, and as it happens, \\"X & Y\\" turns out to be a good one.  It's been a wild ride for the English band.  Since their 2002 \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" Coldplay have turned into international superstars, often inviting comparisons to U2 (and the comparisons are fairly accurate, as far as this reviewer is concerned) and developing a diverse mix of fans.  Coldplay's latest album treads familiar ground, with a few welcome surprises and more of the same brand of sweeping rock listeners have come to expect.  A moody piano, a subtle string section, and Chris Martin's earnest voice highlight the ballad \\"What If,\\" while \\"White Shadows\\" is a mellow rocker whose guitar recalls the Edge from U2.  But the song that almost made my jaw drop is \\"Talk,\\" which steals the hook from \\"Computer Love\\" by Kraftwerk (I am not kidding).  Coldplay influenced by the German synth quartet?  Yes, it's true.  The rest of the album follows a similar pattern: big sweeping melodies, choruses that soar kite-high, and no real duds.  While odds are \\"X & Y\\" will be just as big a multiplatinum seller as its predecessor, it should also prove that Coldplay is more than \\"That British Band Whose Lead Singer Married That Hollywood Actress.\\"
B0001MDP3G|4.0|This movie exists purely in parts.  It doesn't quite work for me as a whole (it felt REALLY long, gratuitous sex, a slow opening, and a storyline that I cared less and less about as the movie went on), but I enjoyed it.  It is good but not great.  But this movie is absolutely heartbreaking in some scenes, which moved me completely to tears.  <br />  <br />Basically, the movie is about a confederate soldier Inman (Jude Law) who is tired of fighting in a war he doesn't believe in.  He decides to return home to his love, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), but Inman is hunted by the North (\\"yankees\\") and the South (who are killing deserters of war) alike.  Of Nicole Kidman and Jude Law, it can be said that they are well-cast in their roles as Ada and Inman.  They do have some chemistry and there are some beautiful scenes between them, and their performances are good, but not great.  This is not intended as a criticism because I enjoyed their work (I thought they captured anguish and love.   <br /> <br />I haven't read the book so I'm not entirely sure what I am saying is fair, but here are my criticisms: one, a really slow opening.  It seemed to take an hour for Inman to finally start returning home to Ida.  I thought the opening war scene was not very well done; too much shock value and too little emphasis on human emotions, brutality of war, etc.  Two, gratuitous sex.  There is just one bizarre sequence in the movie (is it in the book?  I don't know...) where Inman and some corrupt priest end up in a brothel house.  It's very disturbing and gratuitous.  I find it rather unnecessary.  (The love scenes between Inman and Ada are rather graphic but I can understand it since they are deeply in love and \\"Cold Mountain\\" is an intense love story.)  This is definitely not a movie to take little kids to.   <br /> <br />Now that I've gotten all my criticism out of the way, let me say that I also have a lot of praise for this movie.  I said the movie exists entirely in parts and there are several, particularly the ones where the Southern men are hunting down Confederate soldiers who have deserted the war.  There is one scene about a husband and wife hiding their two young boys in their home.  There is another about two men playing instruments to the Southern men, while knowing they will be shot shortly after.  These scenes are very beautiful.   <br /> <br />I think high praise goes to Renee Zellweger for her funny, touching, and strong portrayal of Ruby, the woman that comes to help Ada on the farm.  Zellweger is uproariously funny and coarse; she steals every single scene she's in.  And she is also responsible for one of the more moving moments in the film, when she finds her badly wounded father in the snow, bleeding from a gunshot wound.  But the gem of this movie is, without a doubt, Natalie Portman as a widowed mother with a young child.  Portman's two short scenes are my favorite in the movie.  I don't want to spoil this one for you but Portman's touching and memorable performance (in only 10 minutes of film) will bring you to tears.  It's a very powerful moment...Although \\"Cold Mountain\\" has a lot of these moments, they don't quite work together as a whole.  Still, it is an enjoyable effort and well worth the price of admission.  3.5/5
0375815260|5.0|Excellent vocabulary builder and tons of fun to quote.  Ideal gift for 3rd graders.  This book is on all the reading lists.  For the permanent personal collection.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Dream Theater's Octavarium is an interesting album because it sounds so much different than everything else they have recorded.  No one band member shines as much on this cd, with the exception of Rudess.  Drums are very good but not amazing, guitar is always there but Petrucci doesnt have that standout solo.  Myung has his spots too, like the beginning of Panic Attack.  Best songs are probably Panic Attack and the epic 23 minute title track Octavarium.  The title track sounds like a Dream Theater epic with a very prominent Yes influence--a little of the old, and the new Yes.  There are also some references to other bands' songs, like Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, and Yes's Machine Messiah. <br /> <br />It's definitely worth listening to, but not before Metropolis Part 2:  Scenes from a Memory or Train of Thought.  Those are their best.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|In a world full of bands that SUCK, I thank GOD for Dream Theater's seamingly limitless talent and superb musicianship.  Octavarium is fantastic!  I can't figure out why some fans lament the fact that Octavarium doesn't sound like past DT projects.  What the hell is the point of creating a new album only to replicate what was done in the past???  Anyone can do that.  Truly talented musicians evolve.  The scrap heap is full of bands that could not evolve.  Don't think so?  Than watch VH1's Metal Mania for a good laugh!  DT kicks A**.  I hope I get the chance to see them with Megadeth on Gigantour!
B0009I7NNA|3.0|This is definitely not Avenged Sevenfold's best work. Waking the Fallen blew this way out of the water with it's hard/melody contrasting lyrics. I was disapointed with this album. I was hoping for more of Waking the Fallen's style and I got a softer more mainstream A7X.     Few things I did like was the new heavier more guitar intensive songs. I love guitar and they needed more of it in Waking the Fallen and they delivered. Also more drums. Also good. But Shadow's voice just isn't the best in this new album. His screaming to melody style of the last CD worked much better.     Cmon A7X. Bring the new heavier guitar and drop the new singing for the old and give us something better and new. I'll wait for it.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|All you haters of the new cd are obviously not real AVENGED SEVENFOLD fans to not know Shadow (the singer) had vocal surgery in 2004. So yeh hes not going to be able to scream as on previous cds but come on you cant tell me this is not the best lyrically and musically cd they have ever brought out. The best song is Betrayed dedicated to the God Dimebag Darrell. So chill and understand that he had vocal surgery and be glad he can even talk you idiots.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold have produced a masterpiece here. I can't say I agree with many of the reviews at all. Sure I can hear certain influences but Avenged Sevenfold really show what an original band they are here. Shadows vocals don't always sound 100%, but considering what happened, his vocals are sounding very good. His vocals really are beautiful at times.  <br /> <br />Beast and the Harlot sounds like Metallica? Seriously what Metallica have you been listening to...Doesn't sound anything like Metallica rest assured, very good song. <br /> <br />Burn it Down is A7X at their best. Comes across as quite classical at times, great vocals and some great lead work from Synester and Zacky. Heavy Metal.  <br /> <br />Blinded in Chains has some excellent melodies and a superb chorus, this is another winner. <br /> <br />Bat Country is a quality tune. They have filmed a video for this I do believe, it will be all over your televisions very soon. A talented band on TV? That would make a change wouldn't it.  <br /> <br />Trashed & Scattered - Starts off with some excellent neo classical lick. There is a Velvet Revolver influence in here somewhere but A7X are far more interesting. Don't get me wrong, I dig Velvet Revolver. <br /> <br />Seize the Day...Surely they will release this huh? This is a beautiful ballad. The backing vocals sound very good on this track, really is a beautiful song. <br /> <br />Sidewinder - What can I say, this is a masterpiece. They even pull out their classical guitars in this one, great outro. The song has somewhat of a flamenco theme, really makes this song interesting. <br /> <br />The Wicked End - This is one of the heavier songs of the album. But wait...it slows down and turns into a brilliant orchestral piece, seriously an amazing song.  <br /> <br />Strength of the World - Great southern sounding intro, anybody would think this was a ballad but then the electric guitars kick in. The chorus has a definite 80's feel here. Some of the lead sounds like something off Sonic the Hedgehog, but I'm not complaining, this just makes the song all the more better.  <br /> <br />Betrayed - dedicated to Dimebag, good lads. This kicks off with a beautiful verse, if you can't appreciate this you are probably very ill. I love this song. <br /> <br />M.I.A. - Some weird vocals here but this is an overall winner. The chorus is yet again very good. M Shadows really knows how to sing. I still don't believe he's 100% but like I say, he really does work wonders on this record <br /> <br />Overall, if you like superb solos, huge chorus's and original music (well duhh, who doesn't) then this really is for you. This is quite possibly the most amazing cd in my collection, it is a true gem, BUY IT NOW!   <br />
B0007YMUZW|4.0|At first when I heard this album I didn't know what to think. I was used to Ryan's slower melodys on Love Is Hell and have never been a big country fan. After giving this album a couple listens however, it really has grown. I think that is the case for most of Ryan's albums. You never really know what to expect whether it be slow melodys, alt country, or rock and roll. I think that is what most people love about him the most though. I would definetly reccomend picking up this album, it's guaraunteed to grow on you like it did me. I even went out and purchased a Whiskeytown album to other day!
B0006L16N8|2.0|When I hear this album all I can think is that I've heard all these tunes before. Not all of the tracks are good, and despite a few semi-excellent tracks [i.e. \\"white shadows\\"], the rest of the album is bland and repetitive. Some of the lyrics sound downright pretentious to me, and none are jaw-dropping, though Chris Martin does manage to make them sound pretty.      I see some hope for this band, but they've got to start being a little more innovative/original... the same formulaic rock over and over just isn't cutting it. 2/5 stars
B0006L16N8|5.0|I'm not going to waste time saying which songs I liked and which I didn't. The truth is, I enjoyed and loved the entire album. All the songs work to make this beautiful tapsestry of music and, from the first note, I was held spellbound.<br /><br />I have never heard their first album, but I loved their second \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". I have listened to that album constantly. It turns out that I am more in love with X & Y. There are so many layers to this album that it feels like several blankets that wrap around me comfortably when I listen to this music.<br /><br />Anyone who says they don't like this album obviously hasn't listened to it. It is beyond anything they have done previously and I know it won't be leaving my CD player for the next few months at least.<br /><br />In two words, X & Y is: Absolutley Incredible. :)
B00005K9LK|5.0|Judas Priest released Screaming For Vengeance in 1982 and along with British Steel is their best work. The band continued their winning streak of mixing melody along with the metallic crunch of their '70s albums. This would also prove the band's commercial peak as this would become their biggest selling album and would give them their only U.S. singles chart entry with the metal anthem \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'.\\"<br /><br />Screaming For Vengance finds Judas Priest running on all cylinders. The album opens with the driving \\"Hellion/Electric Eye\\", one of their greatest tracks, and still remains their opening song on their live tours. \\"Riding on the Wind\\" and the title track continue the fury with the relentless guitar work of K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton and Rob Halford's powerful vocals. Tracks such as \\"Bloodstone\\", \\"Devil's Child\\", and \\"(Take These) Chains\\" all contain great riffs and memorable melodies. The lesser known tracks \\"Fever\\" and the mid-tempo groove of \\"Pain and Pleasure\\" are also very good. Finally, the anthem \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\" is heavy metal at its best and is probably the best song the band ever penned. The remastered version contains a previously unreleased track \\"Prisoner Of Your Eyes\\" and a live version of \\"Devil's Child.\\" In conclusion, Screaming For Vengance is one of the best heavy metal albums ever recorded. Highly recommended.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|First off, I would just like to say this: I purchased this album on its release the minute my record store opened. I have listened to it all the way through at least 12 times. <br /> <br />Like all Dream Theater material, you need to listen to the songs many times and REALLY LEARN them to make an honest review. Some people here are listening to songs once or twice, and are quick to judge. YES, you are entitled to your opinion, but that shouldn't come at the cost of putting the band down.  <br /> <br />Now as far as my review, I can say that I will give an honest one, since I have really stopped and listened to this record. First, I would like to note: anyone new to Dream Theater might want to check out Images & Words, Awake, and Scenes From A Memory. I believe any long time DT fan will agree with me.  <br /> <br />Now, here is what I think of each song: <br /> <br />1) The Root Of All Evil- <br />This is the 3rd installment of Mike Portnoy's ongoing theme of AA (This song covers steps 6&7). There are hints of \\"This Dying Soul\\" in the intro riff, and later in lyrics and vocals (and the way those are sung). There is also a hint of \\"The Glass Prison\\" on some vocals. Mike plans to continue this theme for each album. So far, we have the 3 I mentioned above, and I can't wait for the next ones. I can say that although not as heavy as the previous songs, \\"The Root Of All Evil\\" still is a really good addition to the story. <br /> <br />2) The Answer Lies Within- <br />I can't understand why some people do not like this song. DT has always done slower songs well. One thing I will say is this: if JP had added a guitar solo in this one (particularly the piano section that comes before the last chorus), it would be near perfect. Otherwise, this is still a great song for DT fans, especially if you like \\"Anna Lee\\", \\"Hollow Years\\", or \\"Through Her Eyes\\"(to name just a few) <br /> <br />3) These Walls- <br />This song will definitely become DT staple for years to come (in my honestopinion). It has a great intro, and great chorus. It has a few classic DT elements here. Has a subtle, yet fluid guitar solo which fits the song well. And you gotta love that Keyboard riff! <br /> <br />4) I Walk Beside You- <br />This song definitely has a more \\"radio friendly\\" feel to it. But seriously, this song has one of the best build-ups to a chorus, and quite possibly one of the best choruses I have ever heard. After one listen, you will already be singing along. The music is extremely well thought out and written; the lyrics are great; and the vocals are superb. 5 Stars definitely. This will definitely become a hit. <br /> <br />5) Panic Attack- <br />HERE IT IS!!! For every DT fan hoping for another sweet metal tune like \\"The Glass Prison\\", or TOT material, look no further. First off, the bass is amazingly good here (as it always has been, but especially here). The intro riff is very, very good. The first verse has vocals and guitar switching off lines and this verse is by far one of DT's best. Basically, this song far exceeded my expectations of DT's follow up material from TOT. Great speed riffs, too. And even a little epic sounding with the String sounds provided by Jordan. Great vocal melodies are all over the place. <br /> <br />6) Never Enough- <br />Another heavy, fast song is what you will find here. Has a really cool Keyboard intro in which JP and JM join in later. This song also has a great chorus. One aspect of songwriting that DT does well is this (and especially present in chorus parts): The way the music is written under it is never what you would expect. It has good changes, and doesn't follow the standard 4 bar chorus riff. And for DT fans wanting to here a great unison section between Jordan and Petrucci, here is one! Very epic sounding, and extremely precise and fluid. They play it perfectly together (as they always have). There are sounds reminiscent of Metropolis. Those sweep arpeggios are great to (Guitar players will know exactly whatI am talking about)! All in all, a really good song. <br /> <br />7) Sacrificed Sons- <br />An Epic to say the least. Kind of reminds me of \\"In The Name Of God\\". This song, as well as the latter, marks the first time that Dream Theater has used an orchestra (Besides the one they call Jordan!). Very well constructed. Longer, epic songs are really hard to write, but according to MP and JP, they have a harder time writing shorter songs. This song has a very good, somewhat sad sounding chorus. Has a great jam section, and some cool keyboard sounds and solos. Lots of time changes, very progressive. Some will say that this sound reminds them of \\"The Great Debate\\" (both start off with news anchor/various samples, and have a somewhat political message.) Has a good Guitar solo; short, but good. This is followed by a sweet riff with some great harmonics by JP (which he also overdubs harmonies). A definite DT classic. <br /> <br />8) Octavarium- <br /> <br />For those DT fans waiting for an epic follow up to \\"A Change Of Seasons\\" and \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\", the wait is finally over. This song checks in at 24 minutes (1 more than Change Of Seasons). The Orchestral arrangements are superb (Hats off to Jamshied Sharifi). The intro has a somewhat similar sound as \\"The Ones Who Help To Set The Sun\\" from WDADU. Great intro which is followed by a sweet flute solo over some subtle strumming of the guitar. This part of definitely one of the highlights of the song, as it really gives you a feel of where the song is going musically. It is followed by a slow acoustic riff, which reminds me somewhat of Randy Rhoads' \\"Diary Of A Madman\\". The music shifts to a more upbeat sound afterward. After some sweet bass riffs, the song goes into a great piano/guitar riff. Then we come to one of my favorite vocal parts in the song, where LaBrie sings \\"Medicate me...Infiltrate me...\\" Nicely done. Then as we get to the 12:14 mark, here is where the fun begins. This keyboard line is easily nowin my all time favorite Jordan keyboard riffs (many of which you will find in SDOIT). This riff sort of reminds me of a happy progression kind of like \\"Solitary Shell\\" (from SDOIT). It is then followed by a heavier riff, which brings me to my next favorite part of the song. This next part has LaBrie/Portnoy trading Vocal lines, and it is sooo damn good. Reminds me of \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\", minus Portnoy's falsetto (Laughs, those were very \\"King Diamond\\" sounding). It then goes into some very progressive riffs on everyone's part. Especially the ascending/descending riffs played by Jordan and Petrucci. Then we have an utterly fast ascending unison line between JR and JP, which has many changes and bass stabs after. Here comes the next serious section of the song! We hear a great (Yes, I mean it) acoustic riff, followed by a great Guitar Keyboard Harmony (Very Iron Maiden Esque). Then they transform the acoustic riff into a great unison line. Then, the song gets some heavy vocals, with some slight lower Octaves added (not as strong as \\"This Dying Soul\\"). This section is very intense, with LaBrie singing his ass off! You can hear his overdubs screaming at the top of his lungs; it is VERY powerful and intense! It is then followed by a great string line, which slowly descends the song. The last lyric of the song is \\"This story ends where it begins\\" which, coincidentally, ends the same way the album begins. This is AFTER a great epic outro guitar solo by Petrucci (very much like \\"The Spirit Carries On\\", which is one of his best ever). I love the way the solo ends with the Violins in an ascending run. Then, the Violins revisit the vocal melody heard earlier when LaBrie sings \\"Medicate me...Infiltrate me...\\" and it is the perfect ending to the song. <br /> <br />All in All, this album is so good; I can't stop listening to it. When I first got \\"Scenes from a Memory\\", I listened to that album 2 or 3 times a day for 2 months straight, I kid you not. This album lookslike I will do that again. You see, with Dream Theater, I believe many listens are essential. Just like when you meet someone knew, the more you talk to them, the more they grow on you. This is definitely the case with \\"Octavarium\\". This song easily ranks up there with their other epics. My All Time favorite song is \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\", but the more I hear the Title Track \\"Octavarium\\", the more I love it, and the more I realize that I can have more than 1 all time favorite! <br /> <br />Seriously though, you have to give the record a few spins to really take it in. If you love epic songs as much as I do, you will absolutely, hands down, LOVE THIS ALBUM. I can't wait to hear these songs Live! <br /> <br />Sorry for the really long review, but this is the way I feel. I hope that this will inspire new DT fans as well as older ones. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|loved it - bought the boxed set.  I can't believe this was cancelled. The characterisation and script were excellent and the developing plots kept you looking for more.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Give it time. It is a great album, lyric and soundwise. In 2 years, all these impatient folks with their one star reviews will be loving this album, and anticipating the next.  With a thoughtful group of musicians like Coldplay, you just have to give the music time to sink in.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Pop fodder, with crossover appeal; teen and housewife music.  Sure to be on the soundtrack for next season's ER. The utter harmlessness of this popular band says something about our lackluster culture. Can't fault Martin or the rest, but this band just doesn't merit the accolades.
B0001IN0DA|4.0|45-50 Horrible PPV <br />50-69 Bad PPV <br />69-78 Decent PPV <br />78-85 Good PPV <br />85-92 Great PPV <br />85-100 EXCELLENT PPV <br /> <br />John CEna vs Big show US championship- OK opener. Nothing to special or to horrible. As you could expect very slow paced with the Big show in it. Cena hits two FUs to win. Match Rating 6 <br /> <br />Raw Tag titles RVd,Booker T vs La Resictance vs Dudleys vs Cade, Jindrak-NOt to good of a tag match. Could of been good though. They give no time to either tag matches. RVD,BookerT retain. Match Rating 4 <br /> <br />Christian vs Y2J- This is where the good wrestling begins. Very good match with a good storyline. These two work good togther. Christian wins. Match rating 7.5  <br /> <br />Evolution vs Rock&Sock Connection- Great match. Rock and Ric both mock each other. I normally am not to big of a fan of tag team action but this great. Match rating 8.5 <br /> <br />Playboy Tag match- They should of put a different match here a stupid waste of time. Match Rating 3 <br /> <br />Cruiserweight Open- Rey vs Ultimo Dragon vs Shannon Moore vs Funaki vs Nunzio vs Chavo vs Jamie Noble Tajiri vs AKio vs Billy Kidman- Nice match but way to short. They never give enough time to cruserweights. Chavo steals it with the help of Chavo senior. <br /> <br />Goldberg vs Brock Lesnar SGR Stone Cold- Takes to long to get started. When it got started it was ok. The strenght of these two is awesome. NOt to good, definetley dissapoiting.Goldberg wins. Match rating 5 <br /> <br />Too cool vs APA vs Bashams vs Worlds greatest tag team- Nothing better than the raw tag. It was actully worst. Too Cool wins. <br /> <br />WWE championship Eddie vs Kurt Angle- Good match. THese two also work well togther. It wasnt short and rushed like some of the matches on here. Eddie outsmarts angle to win. match rating 9 <br /> <br />Kane vs Undertaker- Good match but not as good as there match at WM 14. To short. ok big man match. Match rating 6.5 <br /> <br />Beniot vsHBK vs HHH- Great match. Beniot is a great wrestler. Nice table spot. Trips taps out to the crossface. I think this is the best main event in WM history so far.(But I havent seen MICHEals vs bret) Match rating 10 <br /> <br />This PPV got an 81 which means it is a good ppv.
B0006L16N8|1.0|This is probably the most overrated album since the beginning of this millenium. I was struggling with two problems when I was listnening to the album, how would I ever survive to the end and where could i find the proper words to describe exactly how bad this album is. Neither of my problems could be solved.... I fell asleep after 'The Talk' and words such as \\"mediocre\\" and \\"lame\\" really does not describe how i feel about this album. I can say this to everybody who is even considering to buy this album: Did you like U2's latest trash you'll love this. Because this is the problem with Coldplay today. They sound way too much like U2.  <br /> <br />So please, for your own sake. Don't listen to the critics, who probably will nominate this album for one of the best albums this year, don't listen to your buddies, who probably already bought tickets to Coldplay's upcoming world tour. And please, please, don't spend 15 bucks on this crap because those hard-earned money will end up in the pocket of some greedy label executive and you will get absolutely nothing in return!
B000002J27|5.0|Phill Collins was destained to be a mighty singer and songwriter. He debuted as a lead singer on Trick of The Tail, and on Dance on a Volcano as well as Squonk he performs supurbly. His work is also grand on Los Endos which is a jam session and coda of the songs on the album. Robbery, Assault and Battery is a song that is a commic spoof on Cops and Robbers, when Entangled is a look into Freud as well as the sounds of Crosby Stills and Nash, that influenced the whole band of Genesis at the time. Ripples is about aging and Mad Man Moon is about looking at things that may seem good and exighting but then can turn into desaster. It is also a song of grass is greener on the other side and that one should be happy with what one has. The tittle song is about prejudice and the old saying of Give to one's self as you give on to others. It is also about do not wish for something and be afraid of it coming to be, or something!!! I really recomend that one hear this album and take into consideration the grandure of Steve Hackett as a guitarist, and Tony Banks as a piano player and keybord player, while Mike Rutherford and Phill Collins were great as a rhythm section.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|More of the same, thanks to Rudess.  If you weren't happy with Train of Thought or 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence, don't bother here.  The same weak songwriting, mindless lyrics, and lack of progressive sound that we've come to expect in the post-Scenes From A Memory era.  I can hardly understand that this is the same band who went against the grain to deliver Images and Words, A Change of Seasons, Scenes from a Memory, Awake, Falling Into Infinity...  These guys sound like a band who spends equal time being a U2 cover band and a Metallica cover band.  I don't mind U2 and I don't like Metallica, but those bands do far better at being themselves than Dream Theater does imitating them. <br /> <br />Yes, I know that Dream Theater has always let their influences remain evident, but this is ridiculous.  There's no hint of Dream Theater in this cd.  I'm thinking now that they may never release something that will equal their earlier work, unless Rudess leaves the band.  This is the last time I preorder one of their cds- I don't feel like throwing away money to a band that feels like selling us recycled, generic, unmemorable crud.  Especially when we know that they're capable of much, much more.
B000002J29|5.0|Second Out is a performance of Genesis in Paris at sometime in 1977. It is a performance that was on the tour of Wind and Withuring and Trick of The Tail. This is the last live performance to be done with Steve Hackett for the group. The album features Bill Bruford of Yes and King Krimson fame on drums in Cinema Show and Phill Collins performing a dual drum session with Chester Thomphson who debuted on this album with Genesis as a member for the touring part of the band's future.  <br />The whole album is amaizing, and especially on the Carpet Crawl where Phill{ who is singing these songs on stage for the first time in the tour} is performing a wonderful version of a song done originally by Peter Gabriel. In fact almost all the songs were songs done by Gabriel and later on Collins, while songs from Trick of the Tail and Wind and Withuring included Dance on A Volcano and Los Endos plus Squonk and Robbery, Assault and Battery plus Afterglow. The French fans adored Genesis and they shouted out the name in thier own way of saying Genesis in French, as one must remember that French was a language of the Church, and that is a name from the Holy Bible; with Gensis being the name in French for Genesis. I fully recomend this true gem of an album.
B0000073BG|5.0|This is Renaissainces' materpiece -- which is saying alot when you've got the likes of Ashes are Burning and Turn of the Cards tucked uner you belt. The musicians , John Tout, John Camp Terrence Sullivan and Michael Dunford are all virtuosos . Put that together with Betty Thatchers lyrics and Annie Haslam -  who just happens to have the most beautiful voice in all of music ( any genre ) -- and you get Schaherezade....Its an amazing -- haunting , atmospheric , breath taking piece of work .
B0009AM5JA|5.0|&quot;Fix You&quot; is right now my favourite song by Coldplay... Musically... not their best album... but lyrically...  it may give Rush of Blood to the head a challenge... here are my ratings<br />Square One:  4.5/5 - some pretty risky notes sung by Chris Martin, lots of energy, good start to the album<br />What If:  5/5 - if you liked songs like &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot;... this maybe your favourite song on the album<br />White Shadows:  3.5/5 - a song i might have to grow into, but still a decent track... it took me a while to really like &quot;Shiver&quot;... so give this track some time...<br />Fix You: 500000000/5 - this song blew my mind... when i heard it on &quot;The O.C.&quot; I automatically fell in love with it... maybe the most touching song they've ever written... in my oppinion of course...  put this one on REPEAT!!!<br />Talk: 4/5 - a little boring... but very easy to listen to... not a standout track...<br />X&amp;Y:  4.5/5 - nice start... the 1st minute or so is quite addictive... the rest may need some time to grow into as well...<br />Speed Of Sound:  5/5 - The next Clocks?  Maybe not.  But still an awesome song, good for n e time of the day...<br />A Message:  5/5 - A clash of The Beatles meets U2, an excellent song... could relate to a lot of you people out there...<br />Low:  3/5 - possibly one of the weaker tracks on the album... very forgettable...<br />The Hardest Part:  4/5 - OK... nuff said<br />Swallowed In The Sea:  5/5 - maybe it's just my taste... i like the soft and sentimental songs by Coldplay... Chris Martin is just brilliant... he can honestly sing anything and make it incredible...<br />Twisted Logic:  4/5 - listenable... i'll like it eventually<br />'Til Kingdom Come:  5/5 - R.I.P. Johnny Cash... i would of loved to hear Mr. Cash sing this song... but I guess Chris Martin will do... <br />i hope my review has been of help... BUY THIS ALBUM NOWWWW!!!
B0009P42S2|4.0|Visual - ***** (excellent animation, superb detailed backgrounds) <br />Audio  - ***   (surround speakers don't seem utilized) <br />Story  - ***   (enjoyable, simple plot, no build up to climax) <br />
B0009AM5JA|5.0|This is by far going to be a must-have for the next few years, until they release a new album (I hope). Chris Martin's voice is absolutely perfect and songs like &quot;Fix You&quot;, &quot;Swallowed by the Sea&quot; and &quot;What if&quot; will certainly send chills down your spine. <BR>Moreover, the first song &quot;Square one&quot; is an excellent way to start. There's nothing more to say more than the fact that &quot;X&amp;Y&quot; is an excellent way to follow &quot;A Rush of blood to the head&quot;. Not too early to say that this will be MY album of the year. Can't wait to see them in concert in August!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|I don't care what anyone thinks but this CD is awesome.  I would've never thought that I would like punk but after listening to this CD I was hooked.  They are an awesome band and if you watch the DVD side, you'll also see the guys are down to earth and they don't think they're the best just because they have their second album.  I highly recommend this CD for anyone!
B0006L16N8|5.0|With each successive album ColdPlay does not disappoint.  Like how \\"A Rush of Blood\\" pounds with \\"Politik\\" as its opener X&Y begins with flashes of surreal energy and eathereal emotions with \\"Square One\\" which opitomizes their style as an opener for this new album.  Theres an equal balance of instrument and energy.  Every band member exudes with passion.  It's no longer frontman Chris Martin and the band.  This is ColdPlay as ColdPlay.
B0006L16N8|3.0|This album is pretty good but not nearly as good as their other two. Nothing on this album really stands out to me as being too impressive. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, but this is nothing special.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I liked \\"X & Y\\" better when it was called \\"A Rush of Blood To The  Head\\" and it was the year 2002.
B0009AM5JA|5.0|An incredible follow-up to AROBTTH, X&amp;Y takes the originally mellow stylings of Coldplay and evolves into a deep, satisfying album from the very beginning.  The first five songs - Square One, What If, White Shadows, Fix You, and Talk - are five of the greatest songs Coldplay has ever put together and any of which are potential blockbuster singles.  If there is but one CD you purchase this year, let it be X&amp;Y.  When the time comes for history to choose the albums that defined this generation in music X&amp;Y will remain standing.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have rarely come across albums where each song is a gem. This album is a must for all fans of good music.  <br />The songs are full of hooks and exquisite guitar work! Enjoy this rare offering!
B00005UEAR|5.0|If you read my review for I&W, you'll notice i said it was the best Dream Theater. I Change my mind, THIS is thier best album. Youget those killer, breath-taking guitar solos from John Petrucci, great HEARABLE bass-lines from John Myung, great drumming from THE Mike Portnoy, cool keyboard effects from Jordan Rudess, and of course the epic vocals from James LaBrie. Read on for my reviews on the tracks.<br /><br />Disc: 1<br />1. The Glass Prison(5/5)Best Dream Theater song...EVER! I love it, all 13+ minutes of it. Also my all-time favorite song. Love \\"III. Revelation\\". \\"Way off in the distance I saw a door...\\" I love that part!<br />2. Blind Faith(5/5)<br />3. Misunderstood(5/5)<br />4. The Great Debate(5/5)Second best song.<br />5. Disappear(5/5)<br /><br />Disc: 2<br />6. Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence(5/5)42 minutes long. This is the longest song I've ever heard. Favorite part of it: War Inside My Head, The Test That Stumped Them All and Grand Finale.<br /><br />So you see, 6DOIT is an underrated masterpiece. Many say I&W and Awake are their best albums; that's okay with me, as they're both great albums. But this is my favorite by them. Glass Prison ALONE is worth this album.
B000002OX7|5.0|If you're going to define classic rock, you'll need to include \\"Who's Next\\" in the definition. There are a handful of albums that anyone growing up in the 1960's and 70's think of when they think of ALL-TIME classic rock albums... Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", Beatles' \\"Abbey Road\\", Led Zeppelin's \\"4th/Zoso\\", Rolling Stones \\"Sticky Fingers, Jimi Hendrix's \\"Are You Experienced\\", Boston's \\"1st\\" amongst others.<br /><br />Released on 8/25/71, The Who's \\"Who's Next\\" contained 9 songs - all receiving airplay (the least of those being John Entwistle's only writing contribution \\"My Wife\\"). 5 of the 9 songs on \\"Who's Next\\" made it to their \\"Ultimate Collection\\" disc. The album ending \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" was played at all shows in 1971 and retained on the concert list at every Who concert thereafter. This album reached #1 in the UK and #4 in the USA of the same year.<br /><br />The classic song list (of the original release):<br />1. Baba O'Riley<br />2. Bargain<br />3. Love Ain't For Keeping<br />4. My Wife<br />5. The Song Is Over<br />6. Getting In Tune<br />7. Going Mobile<br />8. Behind Blue Eyes<br />9. Won't Get Fooled Again<br /><br />The sound production is crisp. The digital remastering makes these great songs sound like they were recorded last week. The 22-page booklet features in depth info, facts, reviews, pictures, and tidbits on the songs themselves. I questioned the bonus material (7 extra songs totaling 33+ minutes of extra music)... and thought why mess with a classic? However, the songs here fit - like it was almost a continuation of the album (and those that know the old \\"Lifehouse\\" project will know that some of the bonus songs here are in fact a continuation). And to boot, I've actually heard some of these bonus tracks. The best bonus songs being \\"Pure And Easy\\", \\"Naked Eye\\", \\"I Don't Even Know Myself\\" and the stripped down alternate version of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" (awesome!!). Nicky Hopkins' piano work helped on several songs, but none bested Townsend's own ivory skills on \\"Baba O'Riley\\". On all the songs, Roger Daltry's voice was never better. John Entwistle brought his usual stunning bass playing. No drum or cymbal was safe with Keith Moon behind the kit. And the rock master guitarist (acoustic/rhythm/lead) Pete Townsend was simply playing on a different level during the making of \\"Who's Next\\".<br /><br />Facts from the liner notes: \\"Going Mobile\\" and \\"The Song Is Over\\" were never played in concert due to the complexity of the songs. Pete played a vintage Gretsch guitar on \\"Bargain\\" gifted from Joe Walsh. The band was driving together when they saw the monolith (which is featured on the album cover)... and having just been discussing Kubrick's movie \\"2001 - A Space Odyssey\\" decided to take matters into their own hands (including a bathroom break and photo shoot). \\"Quadrophenia\\", \\"Who Are You\\", \\"Sell Out\\" and even the rock opera \\"Tommy\\" were Who classics in their own right - but the band's pinnacle is THIS album, \\"Who's Next\\". An easy 5-star review and should be considered essential in any rock listener's collection.songs, Roger Daltry's voice was never better. John Entwistle brought his usual stunning bass playing.

B0009A1AS2|3.0|We've had 4, 5 albums now where the lyrics and inspiration have been simply the everyday world - not the fantastic, frightful realms drawn in Images and Words, nor the melancholy, moody, quasi 19th-century settings of Awake - No, just angst and fame and CNN's America and bi-polarity cliches - And again the music follows, producing your basic prog-rock fare, not the prog-transcending works we come to the table expecting.  If you're still around, you're over that.  Let's see if there are any gems.<br /><br />The Root of All Evil - 2/5 - The Glass Prison was fantastic.  But this is part 3 of what looks to be a 5 or 6 part work, and the last 2 have really lacked any musical theme beyond the \\"12 steps\\" lyrics - anything memorable is simply a rehash of Glass Prison elements.  I'd drop this for awhile, Mike Portnoy, and come back when some fresh inspiration hits.  This one's just a mediocre midrange bridge to... something, we hope.<br /><br />The Answer Lies Within - 1/5 - If artists aren't yet clear that just making 'nods' to older acts (unnamed here) makes only about 3 people in the whole world happy (all critics who are begging to be flattered), I'd like to make that point clear now.  This song is b-o-r-i-n-g.  I hated going to church when I was a kid because the music was just like this, and it made my skin crawl (why I also hated Scenes - sorry, but some of you will feel me here).  Anemic stuff.<br /><br />These Walls - 4.75/5 - This being the slot that Endless Sacrifice, Take the Time, and Peruvian Skies filled (and knowing that DT couldn't lay three bombs in a row), I was fairly excited - especially with the opening grungy licks, leading into a classic Images and Words feel.  The chorus struck me as a little tired at first, but then I realized exactly how finely tuned the atmosphere was, front to back.  If you want to hear one of the most perfect and simple guitar solos of all time, fast forward to this one.  When I think of Octavarium, this will be the song that comes straight into mind, giving me shivers.  Take a few listens.<br /><br />I Walk Beside You - 3/5 - I totally agree that this could be a U2 song.  Nothing extraordinary here, just a happy and sweet song.  A straight lite-rock piece.<br /><br />Panic Attack - 5/5 - Myung (bass), you are a stud.  No review needed, would be totally superfluous.  Anyone who doesn't put this song in their top 10 DT ever is just a snob.<br /><br />Never Enough - 3.5/5 - Cool bridge from Panic Attack, some keyboard *effects*, that's fresh.  The chorus definitely has the whiff of cheese, but stays just on this side of cool.  Pulses straightforward mostly.  Rudess (keyboards) doesn't annoy anywhere, he seems to be at home now.  Good overall.<br /><br />Sacrificed Sons - 2.5/5 - Sigh.  Artists make as many meaningful political insights as politicians lay down memorable guitar licks.  I could forgive that if we could just get beyond the Phantom of the Opera mode that frames songs like this, In the Name of God, and The Great Debate.  Labrie's (vocals) delivery again falls somewhere between preachy and pedantic.  Some interesting changes, and Petrucci (guitars) finally makes an extended appearance, but this song isn't a fifth as big as it hopes to be.  Good close, tho - too bad it comes too late.<br /><br />Octavarium - 3/5 - You'll listen to this, and I think opinions will vary greatly, maybe more than any recent DT track.  I personally am not excited to hear it again for awhile.  And I have no idea what the lyrics are about (well, I do, but I doubt it's that ordinary).  It fulfills its founding idea, tho.  Just wish that founding idea was more magical.<br /><br />This album is *not* Falling Into Infinity, and obviously it is not Train of Thought 2 (so much for \\"metal is clearly the way we need to go\\", paraphrasing Portnoy).  It doesn't have any \\"standard\\" DT tracks - again it is different - maybe closest to 6 Degrees - overall it does not suck.  No reason not to buy.  Enjoy.mes straight into mind, giving me shivers.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|I've always loved Dream Theater's music, but have frequently found that they never quite acheived their potential as a band . . until now. <br /> <br />In the early days, they had good songs, but they were buried under arrangements that showed off each member's technical skill at the expense of the songs themselves.  But they improved.  In 1994, they finally released an album where the themes of one song would be revisited in another song, and the cd as a whole had a conceptual arc.  And they continued to improve.  In 1997, the band finally released an album which was all about the songwriting and creativity, not the showoff virtuoso instrumentalism. Unfortunately there was nothing connecting the songs.  It was just a collection of songs with no arc, and nothing really connecting them.  1999s Scenes From a Memory gave us a sequel to the prog-anthem Metropolis off their 1992 Images and Words album, but also found the band getting more and more bogged down in their attempts to show off how complicated their time-signature changes could be (ever heard of 19/16).  And this trend continued right up to the nearly unlistenable noisefest they released in 2003, Train of Thought. <br /> <br />But now they've shifted gears and given us an album which is all about composition, songwriting, creativity, and beauty.  Yes, there are still impressive virtuoso bits, but they serve the songs, as opposed to the songs serving as vehicles to show off the virtuoso runs.  And it makes for the best album of Dream Theater's career. <br /> <br />The opening track is part 3 of a trilogy of songs which began in 2002 with \\"The Glass Prison\\" and continued with \\"This Dying Soul\\" (the latter of which has its chorus reprised in this new song).  It's a powerful opening to a great album.  The second track finds the band charting new territory with a piano-driven song that you'll be wanting to sing along with from the very first time you hear it.  There's also an honest-to-goodness popmetal song on here called I Walk Beside You (something I never thought DT would ever do).  All of this culminates in the half-hour masterwork that is the title track.  Here, we get reprises of several themes from the album, along with a reprise of the melody to Voices from their Awake album, and a fully symphonic bombastic ending that'll have you requeing the thing to track one the moment it's over. <br /> <br />So yes, I'd call it Dream Theater's best work ever.  And considering that two years ago, I was ready to write them off, that's saying something.
B00011CZRE|5.0|This movie is one of the classical thriller. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman's performances were great. As everybody knows Morgan Freeman fits Criminal physiologist character %100 like \\"Kiss the Girl\\", and \\"Came Along a Spider\\" that I can name immediately. But his performance in this movie is best ever.I watched it several times already!! It is the very valuable piece of my DVD collection.
1573223026|5.0|I'd read the review for this months ago in Kirkus, and my first thought was, \\"How is Hornby going to pull off a book around such an odd topic?\\"  Well, I should have known better than to worry, as Hornby pulls it off with humor and great flair. <br /> <br />As you probably already know, the plot involves 4 people who meet while preparing to jump to their deaths from a famous suicide spot.  Instead of doing so, they band together to form one of the strangest support group/families you'll ever read about. <br /> <br />I think many who read this one will feel bad about laughing out loud at certain passages, given the darkness of the subject.  However, the ability to make us do that, to be able to laugh at topics like death and suicide, is what makes Hornby a great writer.  Even in deadly serious situations, he's able to inject his wit and make us take things just a little bit lighter. <br /> <br />I've been waiting for this one, and it was well worth the wait.  Not only do I feel like my expectations and anxieties were met, but that they were easily surpassed.  I can't recommend this one highly enough.  With all the poor fiction that gets released every week, it's such a great feeling when a gem like this one comes along.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Oh, my God! I can't believe the lukewarm response in some of these reviews! This album completely melts my heart -- it's dizzy with loveliness. It swirls, it spins, it crashes and dives: liquid beauty set ablaze in the abject void of the pop world lately. I'm transfixed, I'm haunted, and I'm ever so deeply grateful to Chris Martin & Co for taking their time with this. For people wanting something \\"new\\" -- please. New for the sake of new is yesterday's news. There is evolution here, but I'd call it more coming-to-fruition. The band picks up with certain strains of thought from earlier efforts but EXPANDS upon them, twisting and twirling them, bringing out all the shimmering possiblities. Listening on headphones, I'm rapt, in rapture, delighted and delirious. If you thought Speed of Sound had potential, wait till you hear it in context. Granted, this is NOT an album for cynics. It gushes with romance. If your heart needs fuel, you owe it to yourself to give it a whirl. If you're looking for a sudden decadent plotpoint in the Coldplay story, you might stay away. You're not gonna find something grungy or jaded for the sake of art-school cred. All the stories leading up to this release warned that U2 had better watch their backs. I'm a HUGE U2 fan and I completely agree. Bono, we have elevation. Colplay is a band for the ages, and yes, Virginia, they just upped the ante.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Though I love Coldplay's last two albums, I too was a bit skeptical if i'd like this.  I watched the songs performed on MTV for the first time and just wasn't \\"wowed\\" by what i heard.  But I also know I've loved about everything they've done previously, and that one listen of any new song/s never makes for a fair review - so I bought the album.  As with \\"Speed of Sound\\" (having been released early and really sticking in my head - in a good way) I found once I began listening to the album, songs had stuck with me without my realizing.  There were some, after just hearing a few times, I can't wait to listen to again and again.  I think if you like Coldplay's other albums, this is definitely worth purchasing.  Maybe it won't be your favorite, but your money won't be wasted.  I give it 5-stars because I like what i hear, and I'm finding i'm growing to like it more and more with each listen - and that I can't say about too many albums.
B0006L16N8|3.0|**1/2 (2 1/2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br />Coldplay has had a place in my heart for the past five years. I've listened to their albums, Parachutes(2000) and A Rush of Blood to the Head(2002) countless times. \\"Shiver\\" and \\"Yellow\\" were first songs of their's that I learned to play on guitar. It was their albums that convinced me that the piano is still very cool and have been a constant inspiration in my own aspirations to become a musician, but all good things must come to an end.  <br /> <br />X & Y doesn't break nearly as much ground as I hoped it would. It starts off with the terrific opener, \\"Square One\\", which is very similar to \\"Politik\\" in the way it strives (maybe too hard) to send a message. It's one of the livelier/better tracks on the album. From here on, Coldplay follows a very strict pattern of uptemo song, ballad song, uptempo song, ballad song (etc). The super-ballad \\"Fix You\\" is bound to be played at the end of some emotional scene of a melodramatic movie or popular television show (The O.C., anyone?) and everywhere some guy with a guitar will try to serenade a girl and fail miserably at hitting the falsetto notes. She will fall hopelessly in love with him and it will be \\"their song\\" at their wedding reception. Boring. <br /> <br />Coldplay tries hard to do something-- anything. They want to be innovative and show their indie cred, \\"White Shadows\\" and \\"Talk\\" (which samples Kraftwerk's \\"Computer Love\\"). They want to woo girls (\\"A Message\\" and \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\"). They want to be political (\\"Twisted Logic\\"). They want to be a little country (hidden track \\"'Til Kingdom Come\\") and they want to be a little Rock 'N' Roll (the very Clocks-like \\"Speed of Sound\\"). They want to be to be everything to everyone it seems. They want to make great music obviously, but they're too hung up on making the music of other artist/bands they admire (U2, Jeff Buckley, R.E.M., and of course, Radiohead) whom did it better, by the way. Let's not even mention the lyrics. They're unimaginative and trite. Now, I'm going to throw you for a loop with the biggest contradictory concluding paragraph ever.  <br /> <br />Despite the fact that I just ripped my favorite band a new one, this is a decent album by a popular band and I'll be right up there with the other \\"Coldplayers\\" rooting for them to succeed when I see them concert later this summer. All they need to do is let go of their inhibitions and find themselves; not a more accessible Radiohead. Until then, I'll be patiently waiting.
B000002BBY|3.0|By the end of the '90s, and living right across the sea from Britain, avoiding Oasis was virtually impossible. Not that I would've bothered trying at the time, but still. Their fame had reached astronomical proportions and it wasn't unusual to have heard of most songs on '(What's the Story) Morning Glory' without having even listened to the album. Now I had a preconceived notion that Noel and Liam were a pair of no-good philandering jerks with inflated egos who performed in a state of drunkenness, swore and even fought with their audiences, and worst of all, were highly disrespectful of their fellow artists(most notably, they publicly hoped that Blur would 'catch AIDS'). None of this was far from the truth. However I had decided by then that all of these acts justified my dislike for them. It seemed perfectly fair at the time, considering I had also picked up accusations of ripping off the Beatles, which seemed like a gross violation of the dignity of the Beatles. Of course none of these opinions were really quite valid, considering that I hadn't actually listened to their music, other than a few songs which had unconciously lodged themselves in my memory. <br /> <br />So a few years later, my memories and vision partially clouded by rose-tinted nostalgia, I borrowed 'Morning Glory' off a friend of mine. I was not disappointed. It is after all a little difficult to be disappointed when one has no expectations. There were a handful of catchy tunes. There was an even greater part however, that was deeply forgettable. The truth is, I listened to 'Morning Glory' to gain some understanding as to why it is considered to be one of the greatest records of the '90s, and maybe even share a bit in that greatness. As of now I am still no wiser than I was previously. All the songs sound instantly familiar. This is not because of any great songwriting skills on Noel Gallagher's part, but because all the tunes have been ah - taken from some other band. Oh well, that doesn't quiterender them any less appealing, although it's almost like a puzzle(like, \\"Hey, isn't that the piano intro to 'Imagine'on Don't Look Back In Anger?\\"). The lyrics are average at best, and also stolen for the greater part(\\"So I'll start the revolution from my bed/'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head\\" from the aforementioned Don't Look Back in Anger). Mostly, they are merely cringeworthy, as in the track She's Electric. Even the catchiest tunes annoy after 4 or 5 listens. This is not in the last place to blame on Liam Gallagher's voice, who tries too hard(and fails) to emulate John Lennon. His vocals are nasal, raspy, grating and in short just plain irritating. Liam seems clueless to subtle differences in emotions such as anger, tenderness, joy. He bellows every song with the same amount of bravado. Is this the voice of a generation? I should hope not. <br /> <br />Not that there aren't some tracks which are commendable. The stand-out ones are Hey Now!, Champagne Supernova and of course Wonderwall. For nostalgia's sake, also give Don't Look Back in Anger and Some Might Say a listen. The rest isn't actually worth the trouble. The 3 stars rating is actually a result of my own sentimentality about the Britpop-generation and therefore not quite representative of the actual grade this album should receive. Now I'm bound to receive a lot of negative votes but this is just my opinion after all, which won't matter in the larger scheme of things. One has to feel a tad sorry for the Gallagher brothers. They DO genuinely believe that they were and still are the greatest band to walk this earth. So all the more tragic is their stubbornness to let go of 1963 as their focal year as they  continue to slide down the list of B-grade celebrities. They are the only band of the Britpop giants to musically remain exactly the way they were in 1995; what with Damon Albarn experimenting with hip-hop and African folk music, Suede and the Verve breaking up and Pulp having released nothing notable for a few years(although Jarvis is set to appear in the 4th Harry Potter movie). Only Oasis's line-up has altered in the course of time; it's usually just the Gallaghers and 3 other guys. In fact, they've practically fossilized. There used to be a time when Noel and Liam's perpetual bickering, between themselves and with other artists, used to be splashed all over tabloid frontpages. Now all we do is smile affectionately and think of the good old days. It is up to you to make up your mind about this album; I'm just an opposing voice in an endless array of positive reviews. <br /> <br />P.S. Liam Gallagher does not have a cockney accent, unlike what some reviewers on this site claim. Cockneys are Londoners. Liam is from Manchester. Oh, and just in case you were wondering, the title of this review is taken from Blur's Country House.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Mezmerize is by far one of the best album yet. System of a down always surprises by the rythme changes and moods present in thir songs. Violent but also with a touch of humor, the songs of this album will make you crank the volume of your radio to the top.<br />PRO: Overall very very good<br />CON: A bit short (36min)
B0006L16N8|5.0|After three longs years, the wait is over. Coldplay have returned with quite possibly the most beautiful, deep and passionate album ever. Experimental sounds and new emotions add a new flavour to an old and treasured favourite. The album is colder and more modern, an almost matrix-album. Full of incredible works ( Square One, White Shadows, Talk and Swallowed In The Sea instantly stand out) and unique sounds, there is nothing more to be said then welcome back boys, and well done.
B0006L16N8|5.0|X&Y is a very solid follow-up to A Rush of Blood to the Head.  This is certainly an album that may take time to grow on fans but it certainly is a strong album.  I would not be surprised to see a lot of bad reviews placed on this album early on.  I think in a year though it will be remembered as the group's strongest output, especially if it is their last.  The only gripe I have is that the original version of \\"talk\\" was not put on the album.  The album version is alright just not as upbeat and lacking lyrically.  Other than that the songs on the album are well-written.  Highlights include Square One, Fix You, X & Y, Low, Swallowed in the Sea, and Twisted Logic.  X&Y is recommended to any Coldplay fan.
B0006L16N8|5.0|X & Y is a darker, trippier album than its predecessor A Rush Of Blood To The Head. Coldplay are showing themselves to be braver and braver with each album, not afraid to redefine themselves, not willing to be limited to the conventional rock setup of drums, bass, and two guitars.  <br /> <br />Theirs has been the voice of the embattled idealist, desperately hanging on to the shards of authentic identity left to an individual in a world of money and commerce, corporations and conglomerates. <br /> <br />The recording is thick and dark as if they were singing from a deep, lonely hole. <br />The need for connection and human closeness comes out in X & Y. The music, like Chris, is trying to communicate, to connect.  <br />And the whole album is the most stunning point of connection with Coldplay, indeed. <br /> <br />Simply a masterpiece. Cheers
B0009A1AS2|5.0|If you looking for Train of Tought II, the shred fest, then you won't find it here.  I just love a couple of the reviewers who, obviously, downloaded LaBrie's solo album, with their terrible reviews (Delete them, please).  The 12 step program once again comes alive from Portnoy continuing what he started in Six Degrees.  After it's all said and done one has to wonder if they will just release those songs on one cd.  If you didn't like the heaviness and darkness of Train of Thought you'll be glad that Dream Theater has come back to form on this release.  The only song that's weak is the ballard, The Answer Lies Within.  They've done ballards before and this just isn't quite up to speed, but it's still okay.  My favorite track on the cd is, These Walls.  Sacrificed Sons continues the quest for answers of religion killing in the name of God for no apparent reason (9/11).  Of course, the epic Octavarium stands out coming in at 24 minutes.  Another gem.  Obviously, the guys took notice and spent a little bit more time developing this cd than on Train of Thought.  Nice job!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|If you start at Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and go to City of Evil you can definatley notice the maturity this band gains with each release.  For those expecting the screaming as on the past 2 albums it's just not going to happen because Matt messed up his vocal chords big time and needed surgery, so keep an open mind before being set on hearing another STST or WTF.  This album is in the style of Guns 'n' Rose's Use Your Illusion albums.  The songs are all different but combine for an amazing expierence throughout the album.    Personal Favorites:    4. Bat Country- Fast, hard, typical a7x  6. Seize the Day- A November Rainish type feel, good lyrics for the girlfriend to enjoy  7. Sidewinder- classic a7x into wicked Santana type guitar solo at end  8. The Wicked End- gotta love 14 piece orchestra/choral interlude reminds me of I Won't See You Tonight Part 1 from WTF  9. Strength of the World- Western intro, into a classic hard a7x song  (last 3 songs really show the maturity and the risks the band is taking, I really enjoyed them and thought they add a lot to the album others may not, but I think these songs are epic)  11. M.I.A.- Iron Maiden-esque guitars/drums prehaps my very favorite song on the album.  Those looking for the old a7x are never going to get that, and those worried about the album being too mainstream when have you heard of a mainstream album with songs on the average of 6mins & 40 seconds long.  To think of what's to come from this very talented band is mind boggling
B0006L16N8|5.0|Can Coldplay get any better??? I hope because I want more albums from them. This is by far the best album from the guys so far. All the songs on the cd are great. I wouldnt skip one of them.Buy this cd!!!!
B00008ICF8|4.0|'Malesch' was Agitation Free's first album release. Originally put out in 1972, with founding members bassist / keyboardist Michael Gunther and guitarist / keyboardist Lutz Ulbrich. Some say 'Malesch' is one of the better krautrock efforts ever. Personally, I cannot disagree with that at all. Here, Agitation Free fuses spacey synth work, an atmospheric vibe with a Middle Eastern sound as so few ensembles can. Best cuts include &quot;Sahara City&quot;, the intricate &quot;Khan El Khalili&quot; and the title track &quot;Malesch&quot;. For other great Agitation Free titles, make sure to check out their CD reissues of '2nd', 'Last', 'Fragments' and their 1999 reunion effort - the fantastic 'River Of Return' (see my review). Should appeal to most fans of Faust, Terry Riley, Kluster, Tangerine Dream and Steve Reich. A great pick. Recommended.
B0008KLVG4|3.0|Everyone's so disgruntled at the release of a 30th anniversary edition of one of the greatest adventure films ever made. But why? So many people who visit Amazon are, like me, collectors but at times a little restraint is all you need to not buy into the \\"yet-another-special-edition\\" trap. Do what I do. Ask yourself..do I NEED it or do I WANT it?
B00097DX3U|4.0|Being a huge RATM fan, I was delighted to hear that Morello and co. would be joining with Cornell who I considered the top vocalist of the 90s. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the first Audioslave cd but many people I talked to were put off by it because it wasnt as heavy sounding as RATM or didnt contain as powerful of vocals like Soundgarden. <br /> <br />That said, when I played this cd for the first time I was blown away.  The first 5 tracks are outstanding and even if you dont get the cd, you'll still know them as they'll be on the radio for sure. <br /> <br />The problem with this cd is that the last half of the cd doesn't stand out and almost comes off as filler.  I still like it, but those who were only casual fans of RATM and Soundgarden may be put off by this one. <br /> <br />If it was on vinyl and the first 5 tracks were featured and the last bunch were B-sides, this would be a monumental album
B00005U2JL|4.0|This is a mind-bending look at one of the world's most controversial artists both on and off the stage. Shot throughout the U.S., Japan, Russia and Europe, this release spotlights the performance that has made Manson truly infamous.<br /><br />This DVD contains features whichs give the viewer an \\"all access pass\\" to off stage life and a glimpse behind the scenes as the tour takes them from Tokyo to Berlin, Moscow to Rome, Long to New York, and everywhere in between.<br /><br />See U In the Future...
B0006L16N8|5.0|For anyone who has been a fan of Coldplay since their debut with Parachutes, there was little doubt that their third release wouldn't disapoint.  X&Y lives up to the standards Coldplay set with the sensitve Parachutes and the epic A Rush of Blood to the Head.  Absolutely worth your money.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Now I am a 15 year old DT fan, and have been for almost 2 years now.  This album is awesome!  It probably contains the most talent and progressiveness DT has, but it lacks a little of John Petrucci's crazy guitar solos, but they're still awesome.  It's John Petrucci for crying out loud!  Another thing is that Jordan Rudess shines too much on this album, which also kinda drowns out the guitars a bit.  Another reason this song gets 4 stars is because i sorta dislike 3 of the songs on this album, and that rarely happens on a DT album.  These songs are \\"I Walk Beside You\\", \\"Panic Attack\\", and \\"Never Enough\\".  \\"I Walk Beside You\\" is too, well, not-progressive for DT, and it sounds like a freaking U2 song.  \\"Panic Attack\\" is pretty good, but the keyboards don't seem to fit well in it.  It still has that cool heavy quality DT is known for, but for some odd reason I find it a bit annoying (probably from the keyboards).  \\"Never Enough\\" is, well, just weird.  In a way I sorta like it, but i also find it extremely crappy.  Definitely the worst song on the cd and one of DT's worst songs.  But those are just 3 misses on the album.  The remaining 5 are probably DT's shining moments in their career.  \\"The Root of all Evil\\" is my favorite song on here, followed by \\"Octavarium\\", one of DT's most impressive and complicated pieces.  This song is like the new \\"A Change of Seasons\\", clocking in at exactly 24 minutes.  It'll give you chills.  Those 2 are surely in my top 10 favorite DT songs.  \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" is simply one of DT's most beautiful songs, but i was a bit disappointed since it has no guitar solo, although the small string ensemble solo makes up for it.  \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" and \\"These Walls\\" are also fantastic, and deserve a lot of credit.  So, despite the lack of guitars and 3 not-so-great songs, this album is fantastic, just ranking right below DT's 3 best albums (Scenes from a Memory, Train of Thought, and Images and Words), so it's still one of their better cds.So go out and buy it!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I haven't really listened to these guys since I picked up their 1998 self-titled debut album. I vaguely remember being a big fan of \\"Sugar\\" and a few other tunes on the disc. I remember thinking it was some of the heaviest metal I've ever heard. But I subsequently got into other genres of music, and ignored these guys for the past 7 years; shame on me.<br /><br />Well, it's now 2005, and a friend of mine made me throw \\"Mezmerize\\" in for a listen. I could not believe that this was the same band that I knew of in 1998. These guys have vastly improved, light years ahead of their debut. These guys are just so raw, jagged and ambitious. Intensity is just oozing out of these guys by the bucket full. It makes for a very exciting listen. The lyrics are also excellent, which includes a great sense of humor. But what I felt was most impressive, was the vast amount of time changes in the music. They go from slow, to fast, to intense, to melodic, then back to the intense, so effortlessly. It's just as impressive as listening to Mr. Bungle, although this makes for a more \\"enjoyable\\" listen. My favorite cuts are \\"B.Y.O.B.,\\" \\"Cigaro,\\" \\"Radio/Video,\\" \\"Violent Pornography,\\" and both of the \\"Hollywood\\" songs that close out the album. This music will hold your attention; it practically forces you to.<br /><br />System of a Down are definitely among the elite of heavy metal bands today. It's just too bad that most of them are remarkably boring and unoriginal. That certainly isn't the case with \\"Mezmerize\\".
B0006L16N8|5.0|Well, I just bought this album today and I have listened through it a few times...letting it soak in a bit. I love it. Through and through. I fell in love with Coldplay when I heard Rush of Blood and fell in love again when I discovered Parachutes. X&Y has only added to this infatuation.  <br /> <br />First off, a lot of people here are whining because Coldplay didnt release another Rush of Blood. If you like ROBTTH, listen to ROBTTH. Coldplay is taking strides forward, and I like where they are headed. Buy it, buy it now.
B0009ML238|5.0|This is what I called superb prog metal!!!! Great vocals, great melody arrangements... great solo... great drumming and great overall sound!!!! Prog Metal hits you in the face no holds barrell album!!!! No ballads like Octavarium and 70's era prog sound.......... We want new refreshing sound!!! Yes again I said Great Prog Metal bands hails from Europe!!! Europe is number 1...... I tell you DT will soon losses its loyal fans because their songs becoming so boring and repetitive. Listen to Pagan's Mind and Circus Maximus!!!! Powerful!!!!
B00097A5I6|4.0|I only janked off a star from Oasis' 2005 release, \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" simply because there are quite a few moments throughout the album where I feel like I am listening to a line from the Stones (\\"Lyla\\") or The Beatles (\\"Let There Be Love\\"). But this aside (which is nothing 'new' in terms of Oasis' work), this is a solid Rock 'N Roll album to love and to blast through your speakers. After more than ten years around, and still standing tall among a sea of other rock acts, the sound of Oasis continues to come through loud and clear.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Watching tv the other night I saw Buble singing and acting in a Starbucks commercial. What a voice and is he ever cute. <br />No wonder my friends have been raving about him - ok so it took me a little while to discover what they knew, but I'm a fan now. <br />It doesn't seem to matter what song he sings he's got a beautiful voice - slow, fast - every track is a treat to hear. <br />Starbucks -- THANK YOU!
B0006L16N8|3.0|So here I am, listening to the new \\"X&Y\\" Coldplay album... the first track simply struck me as a straight-up U2-ripoff. The album moves into songs that have some merit and it's a beautifully-sounding album most of the time, but they seem to have decided to live under the shadow of the Dublin legends, for some reason that escapes me.<br /><br />As I listen through most of the rest of the tracks, except for Chris Martin's signature voice, their overall sound (specially in the \\"guitar-heavy\\" segments) is too much like U2's. Actually, even in some parts Chris Martin seems to want to sound like Bono... If this is an accident...  well, it doesn't sound like it. I know most people are annoyed by the comparison between the two bands, but when you're a band of Coldplay's stature, first you cannot avoid being on the spotlight, and then, you can really afford to pursue different creative avenues.<br /><br />By the time, I hit the last corner in the album (\\"Twisted Logic\\") I grew so tired of the repetition in their U2-like sound, that a song that I would have otherwise enjoyed, just left me dissapointed: it clearly makes you feel they had more that they could deliver in this album that they saved for themselves, in order to stick with a formula that has worked beauties for them.<br /><br />Taking the comparison to an end, in spite of the fact that U2's latest album is far from being my favorite by the band, I enjoyed it far more than Coldplay's \\"X&Y\\". After their first two albums, which I enjoyed and decidedly purchased, this may be the first Coldplay album that I skip. As for \\"X&Y\\", I will give it 3.5 stars. It's a good album, but not the five stars work I was expecting from them. Among the other albums that came out today, I would probably recommend Oasis' \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" or The White Stripes' \\"Get Behind Me Satan\\".
B00000612P|5.0|Of all the records ever recorded,this goes down as the very best of the best. It's only short (8 songs)- as they were in those days (1971),but the album is easy to listen to,from start to finish. I'm 41 but I think people of all ages can get something out of this record. Few albums have stood the test of time so well.Maggie & Mandolin Wind are the stand-outs among a <br />bunch of real good Tunes.If some evil Being put a spell on me & I could only own 1 CD - This would be it. Second, maybe Free's <br />\\"Fire & Water\\".
B00005JNVS|5.0|I've been to see this movie three times so far, and it gets funnier and more enjoyable with each viewing.  I am overwhelmed by the superb action sequences, the comedic timing, and the serious, touching undertones, all of which integrate to produce a truly wonderful experience.  I whole-heartedly recommend this movie!
B0006L16N8|5.0|After the brilliant Rush of Blood to the Head album (which I've listened to nonstop for two years now) I wondered if Coldplay could top it with X&Y. After digesting the album over the past couple days, it's clear they have.  They've taken their music and sounds to a new level without losing their core qualities. It's a masterpiece.  The band's sound is evolving with more sophisticated, layered, sometimes high-tech sounds (without being over-produced), and songs that build and elevate with surprising twists and turns--filling your ears with chord structures that simply sound awesome!  It's the best of British rock, occasionally pulling in Radiohead-like guitar and tech sounds, and Oasis-like endings and tamborine rhythms.  The song X&Y is the best example of other Brit rock influences. There's a sort of \\"cosmic\\" lyrical thread through the entire album with light shooting up from underground, floating on tidal waves, ladders climbing to the sun; an emphasis on a big, spatial universe with humans caught in the middle striving ahead yet stuck in reverse.  In the end, much like U2 themes, love wins and makes it worthwhile. The tunes X&Y and A Message are absolute winners, but the whole thing is epic (maybe except for White Shadows...not sure what to make of that one so far).  Coldplay has delivered.
B000065VB0|5.0|I've been a Peter Gabriel fan for a long time, but nothing prepared me for this.  His experimental, mutli-layered, and international musical style works perfectly for much of this album.  Highlights include the punchy, driving \\"Not One Of Us\\" which simultaneously depicts the evolutionary function of prejudice, and it's irrationalality.  \\"Intruder,\\" besides being an astounding, sonic marvel, may be the creepiest song I've ever heard.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|I lost faith in this band, and that loss started with \\"Train of Thought\\" and ends with \\"Octavarium.\\" This album represents everything that is currently wrong with progressive metal in my opinion. It sounds like recycled music from other albums that didn't quite make it to albums. They should've instead released this album as B-Sides from other albums. I would like to think that, but no this a STUDIO album from Dream Theater. Everything sounds like it's played by a completely different band. It's kind like \\"Okay, Dream Theater has left the studio, so the DT cover band is ready to record now.\\" Dream Theater's worst album to date. The music lacks heart, devotion, angst, and for crying out loud what is with all the singing coming from James LaBrie? They need to get rid of him. He's a bad influence and that's becoming more evident after hearing this crappy album.<br /><br />I also want to say that this band was once upon a time an incredible band that let the music overshadow everything including the vocals. James LaBrie's vocals in the past were limited for a reason. The band doesn't need him, but after hearing this album, I've come to the conclusion that \\"Octavarium\\" marks the end of the bands innovation and creativity. What a waste of time and money!
B0006L16N8|4.0|One of the best bands of the new millennium is Coldplay. With their first two albums, they were posed to battle U2 for the \\"Greatest Band in the World\\" title, a title that U2 has held for most of the last 25 years. Parachutes was a good introduction with mellow grooves, just something to sit back and relax too. It also set up what has become the signature Coldplay sound. Then with A Rush of Blood to the Head, they perfected there sound of crushing guitars and piano strings. X&Y could be the make or break album. <br /> <br />We got of what the new album will sound like with Speed of Sound, the first single that has been out for a while (one critic said it sounds like Clocks but without the passion). Sadly, that is about the best we will get to hear on the album. X&Y is, in essence, a step backwards from A Rush of Blood to the Head almost as it was the missing link between Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to th Head. <br /> <br />So what we get on X&Y are songs about new love. One song sappier that the first. The best of these songs is Fix You. A song about trying to fix any problem your girlfriend has no matter how hard the problem is. Had they stopped there, it would have been good for the album but then we have to sit through others relationship issues like What If?, Talk, A Message, The Hardest Part, and Swallowed in the Sea. <br /> <br />The standout track is the hidden closer, Til Kingdom Comes. A song the band originally wrote for Johnny Cash's American Recordings V, but unfortunately Cash died before recording it. On a side note, I cannot recommend American Recordings I-IV enough. Coldplay ended up recording it for themselves, so what you get is an old-school county song with Martin bringing out a rare baritone voice. <br /> <br />In the end, if you liked their first two albums, most likely you will like this. Hopefully on the next album, they experiment a little more maybe even try a couple more songs like Til Kingdom Comes. <br /> <br />As an after word to this review, I caught a MTV special with Coldplay performing the songs off the album. I caught it about halfway through, but what I heard was more passionate than what was on the album. Maybe instead of comparing them to U2, Dave Matthews Band might be a better comparison as their studio albums never sound as good as their live shows.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I think that this album is leaps and bounds over the last album. I think musically, lyrically, and creatively. Its just a far superior album by far. The first album was more or less Rage Against the Machine meets Soundgarden, whereas this album is Audioslave definining a sound as their own. I mean dont get me wrong, the first album had distinct songs that made Audioslave stand out as their own band, but not as much as this cd does. Great album in my view!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|At 47 I have seen and listen to a lot of great bands in both prog and mtal . When I heard them for the first time back in 1992 I was impessed . When scene's 2 came out I was amazed and now I can safely say that dream theater is WOW (AKA world of wonder)simply unmatched
B0000VCZKW|1.0|Special Edition? What a joke! What makes it special? Tossing in a few stupid games? Just another lousy Pan and Scan version of this good movie. Don't waste your money. Hopefully sometime soon they will finally release this in widescreen.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I would have preferred a filmed version of the play, but making a movie does allow for real special effects.  But, I want to focus on the music.  The music is what holds the story together, I believe.  The score and the lyrics are the essence of the entire story.  In spite of there not being a full orchestra in the play, there were organs and synthesizers to round out the sound.  The film version seems thinner - in spite of a full orchestra, and the play seemed richer because of the greater variety of instruments.  Listening to the two soundtracks actually lead me to believe that the play had the larger orchestra. <br /> <br />The singing was good.  Other than the small percentage of theater-goers who actually got to see Brightman and Crawford, there were many different Phantoms and Cristines around the world.  Yes, every Phantom can be compared to Crawford.  Crawford had a timbre in his voice that could not be matched by anyone else.  In the movie, I don't believe they even tried.  They found a very competent singer who had a stage \\"presence\\" which overcame any of his singing shortcomings.  I found him far more effective as the Phantom. <br /> <br />The second disk was great.  It allowed an insight into the struggles to put together a play according to Andrew's vision - after he had read the original book.  Things like the songs and music constantly evolving over the years of stage performances was an insight I would not have known.  I had only seen the play twice in Boston at fairly close intervals. <br /> <br />The play stayed with me since that time.  It is haunting and ethereal.  It is dramatic and sad.  The film helps me relive the stage performance.
B0009ML238|5.0|Sadly, in this era of post punk, post rock, hip hop and manufactured teen pop idols, progressive rock and metal music, which flourished in the U.S. in the 70's and had a few metal proponents in the the late 80's and 90's with groups like Queensryche, Fate's Warning and Dream theater has been left to the rest of the world where it fortunately remains vibrant.  Scandanavia, in particular, has picked up the proverbial torch.  Among several extremely talented young groups, Circus Maximus emerges with their first release, \\"The First Chapter\\". This album is a genuine stunner.  It is complex blending musical virtuosity with interesting time changes and great vocal performances including some great harmony.  The muscianship is first rate with an extraordinary lead singer.  I ordered the disc on a lark, and I was pleasantly surpised.  This is one of the better prog metal releases I have heard in recent years.  Hopefully, these guys will get the recogniting they deserve.  Highly Recommended.   <br />David in Tennessee
1573223026|5.0|This is another excellent novel from Nick Hornby who has yet to write anything that I have not enjoyed. It is the story of four very different characters. <br /> <br />Maureen is a downtrodden single parent whose life is dedicated to caring for her severely disabled son. Martin is an obnoxious daytime TV presenter who has been the subject of a high profile sex scandal. JJ is a musician who always wanted to be a rock star but now deliver pizzas. Jess is an impulsive teenage tearaway. It is hard to imagine a group with less in common.  <br /> <br />What does bring them together is a tower block - Toppers House - in London on New Years Eve where each arrives intending to leap to their doom. They inevitably discuss what has brought them there. I must say that I feared that they would understand each others pain and then hug each other living happily ever after in a community. But they don't. In fact whenever I thought I knew where it was going it went off in a different direction. Never predictable and never dull.  <br /> <br />They are certainly not a likeable bunch. Why else would they be at Toppers House in the first place? But they are a fascinating group of oddballs and their mutual dependency is both touching and amusing. The subject matter is never trivialised even though there are several laugh out loud moments. The writing is always excellent. Watch out for Maureen's discovery of Nick Drake's music. That is a real `waterworks' moment.  <br /> <br />Don't be put off by the gloomy subject matter. This is his best to date and should not be missed.  <br />
B0009OPO0S|5.0|Shakira is back with full of surprises.  'Fijacion Oral\\" wow, what a title!. trough each song Shakira reveals her soul, her heart,  her feelings, her inspirations, her artistic creativity. Her voice has reached a more mature and romantic pith capable of shaking up your most inner emotions with songs like  \\" Obtener un si\\", \\"La pared\\", \\"No\\" .(the best ones on the CD for my taste)  I was lucky to see her performing live \\"Obtener un si\\" on June 3rd  in Good Morning America at  Bryan Park in NYC and I was amazed of her powerful vocals and seductive and romantic innocence.  So in Shakira's new release album  you will find songs to fall in love in a Sinatra  kind of way,  songs to shake your hips and songs that will take you back to the electronic sounds of the 80's.  If you happened to get the dual cd-DVD version, it is wonderful to be able to know Shakira in a more personal way. Shakira not only gives herself through her songs but  through some footage which reveals a more natural, romantic,  funny, personal  Shakira.
630460288X|5.0|Initially, when I saw the preview for this movie back in 1993, I will be the first to admit that I thought this movie was going to be terrible.  However, I was convinced to watch this movie when it came out on video and I must say that this is one of the best sci-fi/action movies I have seen.<br /><br />Demolition Man takes place in the year 2032 in the city of San Angeles, which encompasses the current day cities of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and San Diego.  The society closely mimics the society described in the book \\"The Time Machine\\" by H.G. Wells.  Most of society resembles the \\"Eloi\\".  Society has turned into a utopia of political correctness.  Most everyday things have been made illegal including swearing, sex, spicy foods, and salt for example.  The city has no violence or firearms of any kind.  Rather than prison, criminals are frozen and rehabilitated during their \\"hibernation\\".  However, there is an underground \\"Morlock\\" type society known as \\"scaps\\" in the movie.  The \\"scraps\\" are the free thinkers, which I would compare to modern day Americans.<br /><br />The leader of San Angeles secretly releases a violent criminal, Simon Phoenix (played by Wesley Snipes) to kill the leader of the \\"scraps\\", Edgar Friendly (played by Dennis Leary).  The police release another \\"cryo-con\\", a maverick 20th century cop named John Spartan (played by Sylvester Stallone) who originally captured Phoenix in the 20th century and was framed during the arrest of Phoenix.  Spartan is partnered with a bored officer named Lenina Huxley (played by Sandra Bullock), who is a naïve police officer obsessed with the 20th century.<br /><br />The result is an awesome action film with a shaky plot.  This movie reminds me a lot of \\"The Last Boyscout\\", a loud movie with a lot of shootouts.  However, this film is also filled with many laughs, as Huxley rattles off many 20th century clich&eacute;s but manages to screw most of them up.  Product placement in the movie is everywhere.  Despite the frequent referral to brand names that would become nauseous in most movies, the product placement works very well in this movie and adds to the comedy and charm.  The movie also makes references to a couple of 20th century actors such as Arnold Schwartzenegger and Jackie Chan.<br /><br />If you enjoy an occasional pointless, loud, violent action movie, this is definitely the movie for you.  While I would not rate this movie as a masterpiece, I do think this is one of the few movies that pull action and comedy together exceptionally well.  I thought the mix of actors worked exceptionally well in this movie and complimented each other beautifully.  I would definitely say this is a must see movie!  I think the movie is even better now as it brings up a lot of memories of the late 80's and early 90's.frequent referral to brand names that would become nauseous in most movies, the product placement works very well in this movie and adds to the comedy and charm.

B0009I7NNA|4.0|Well, I have been a fan of a7x for 4 years, and I have been anticipating this album for well over a year, but after I heard \\"Beast and the Harlot\\" I was feeling a bit, well, disappointed, the vocals we're terrible, too overproduced, but then I heard \\"Trashed and Scattered\\" and that blew my mind, this is the new Avenged Sevenfold, and they're raising hell on the music world. Here are my song reviews: <br /> <br />1. Beast and the Harlot- 3/5 (Not a very good song, but after the 4 minute mark, it brings its score way up) <br />2. Burn It Down- 4/5 (Great bounceback of a song, and it has a great transition from BATH, and I remember hearing \\"there will be no breakdowns\\", well what is that near the 2 minute mark, an Avenged Breakdown) <br />3. Blinded in Chains- 5/5 (Another great transition from the last song, into an even better song, the vocals are really well done on this one) <br />4. Bat Country- 5/5 (Very good song, a perfect mix of heavy and soft, and the lyrics and vocals are good in this as well) <br />5. Trashed and Scattered- 5/5 (Good old school Thrash song, maybe not as thrashy as Trivium, but a damn good song none the less) <br />6. Seize the Day- 5/5 (A great acoustic song, with the best sounding vocals on the whole album) <br />7. Sidewinder- 5/5 (Probably the best out of the acoustic bunch) <br />8. The Wicked End- 4/5 (Great song, especially the Edward Scissorhands-esque orchesteral breakdown) <br />9. Strength of the World- 4/5 (Not as cheesy as the choir part sounds, I do like the Spaghetti Western beginning, since it fits well with the lyrics with revenge) <br />10. Betrayed- 5/5 (Very interesting lyrics, it's a tribute about Dimebag, but the point of view is from the gunman) <br />11. M.I.A.- 5/5 (Great ending to a truly great album, second best vocal stylings of the album) <br /> <br />But still, Waking the Fallen is way better
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I just got the CD and after having listened to it three times I already place it among my favourite DT's Albums. I'd encourage progressive rock fans to listen carefully to the title track (almost 24 minutes!), probably the best piece of music ever written so far by DT. Interestingly, you can hear echos and citations of all well known DT's influences. It starts with a PINK FLOYIDISH \\"Shine on you crazy Diamond\\" type of atmosmophere, it builds into a GENESIS Peter Gabriel's flute melody reminescent of Selling England by the Pound, it grows into RUSH's Geddy Lee bass riffs that seem taken from LA Villa Strangiato e Cygnus X-1 (the citation here is obvious since Lee and Myung normally have a very different sound). Later in the song you will clearly distinguish YES's keyboard solos, BRUCE DICKINSON's angry singing and even DAVE MUSTAINE's Donald Duck voice. To recap, blend Pink Floyd, Genesis, Rush, Yes, Iron Maiden, Megadeth and lots of Dream Theater original style and you will get this masterpiece. I have listened to the song only three times, I am sure there are more citations. Listen to it and find more!
1401301010|5.0|I enjoyed this book because: <br />1. Pure fun. The stories told in a language of a student giving his or her friend relation of a yesterday party. Anthony shows true face of some other stars too. <br />2. Meaning behind the addiction. Anthony does not condemn drugs nor glorifies his way of life. He is credible for people who have a problem because he has not become a freak after becoming sober. <br />3. People behind the music. I liked the band before but now I have much more fun listening to their music because I understand the cheesy background of many songs. <br />To sum up it is a very sophisticated book. It does not give you simple answers but it may be an eye-opener. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|What can i say, Coldplay has done it again. Don't be suprised if it wins many grammys because this cd has been well worth the wait. This cd sounds very similar to A Rush Of Blood To The Head, which is a good thing because both albums are amazing in their own ways. The album kicks off with square one which sounds imediantly like the begining of Politik. They both seem to start out there in the middle of space. \\"What if\\" is another very coldplayish sounding song. It's a very pleasing ballad. But there's plenty of great ballads on this CD too, like fix you,In my opinion is the best song on the album, And white shadows. The first four tracks are just enjoyable to listen to. But there's plenty more on this cd that makes it an instant classic. \\"Talk\\" sounding much like U2,mainly because the band used U2's style of guitar playing, \\"infinity.\\" Speed of sound would have to rank with such Coldplay greats such as \\"yellow\\", \\"clocks\\", and \\"In my place\\". As the album goes along you get two average quality songs \\"a message\\" and Swallowed in the sea\\". It's not like I dont like these songs, but they're just weaker tracks compared to the other great songs on this album. Twisted logic is a great song and i can see why Coldplau named their tour after it. But What i think is the best closing song ever from any coldplay album would have to be \\"till kingdom come\\". Its a fantastic acoustic song. <br />5 key tracks: (in no particular order) <br />Square one, Fix you, Speed of Sound, Till kingdom come, Talk.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I divide Coldplay songs into two categories:  Songs that I could never get tired of hearing and songs that I have to be in a \\"Coldplay\\" mood to listen to.  Both of their previous albums are filled with examples of both.  Luckily, this is one of the few bands whose singles are all in the first list, with the Scientist being the only exception.  X & Y, once again, offers plenty of both.  After a few days, Speed of Sound (though a bit of a Clocks retread), Talk, Square One and Low are my early favorites, and could easily end up as the type of song that I'll never tire of.  Others are definitely more Coldplayish...What If? is the best example...the chorus will stay with you for days after you've heard it a few times, but once you find yourself in a mood for an upbeat rocker, its the kind of song that you'll skip (as are many of Coldplay's best songs). <br /> <br />My personal grading scale aside, I have to say this is one of the best albums I've ever bought....and one of the few that has lived up to the hype that preceded its release.  Coldplay pulls off a nice trick that few bands have managed, and that's tinkering with things and changing their sound a bit without SOUNDING like they've changed their sound.  The best parallel I can think of is REM in its hey day following up Green with Out of Time.  Everything is instantly identifiable as a Coldplay song, yet repeated listens will reveal some nuances that show the band isn't just trying to remake the previous album. <br /> <br />All in all, I would recommend this to anyone that enjoyed the previous two albums.  There are those, such as my lovely wife, who think Coldplay are whiny, and that opinion will only be reinforced with X & Y....My one (very minor) complaint is that at times Chris Martin opts for the falsetto voice a few times too often.  But trying to find fault with an album this good is sort of like trying to name the worst Beatles album...no matter how you slice things, its still better than almost anything else out there. <br /> <br />Coldplay is a band that takes its music seriously, but its nice to have a young band out there that is still defining their legacy and showing that they have what it takes to belong in the company they aspire to.  And especially after such a long layoff and all the attention and hype that come with having a hit album, marrying a Hollywood actress and becoming a staple of People Magazine's photo pages, its nice to see that an artist can stay true to his overshadowed (and underappreciated) bandmates and turn out a terrific set of songs.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|It is of fantanstic quality and it sounds wonderful. This is a DVD for Dido Fans and those who have also just discovered her. It is nice to see her be so honest with her audience, she works the crowd well. I only hope to get to see her someday, but til then this DVD fills the need. Dido is awesome!!!!
B000301YY8|5.0|Heard about this CD while working in London.  Bought it yesterday and have played it continuously.  It is heartbreaking, melodic, emotional,and original.  If you enjoy music that is a soundtrack to life, then this is the one for you.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is such a deeply lush, sonically layered, beautiful album.  After going to their concert I realized the natural talent in each of the members only exponetially amplified by their cohesive work as a whole.  As each member has extreme talent learning several different instuments each early in life, their potential has definitely been maximized on this album.  Let's just wait and see if they'll expand their horizons in the future and be brave enough to blow us all away with something entirely different which can't be bad considering the amount of raw talent here.  What shines on this album more so than their previous full length releases in the songsmanship and the deeply introspective as well  as wholly wordly meaningful lyrics.  His voice is beautiful in it's strange four range octave and his application meshed with expert percussion and rich guitars makes for a satisfying listen .  This album is a go anywhere, do anything album that most peoples mothers would probably enjoy.  It's a great listen that only becomes more so if you pay attention to ALL of the elements of the entire band.  We have crafstmen building their best and only getting better.
B000069AUI|5.0|AROBTTH is not better than Parachutes...it exceeds that album in every way possible. AROBTTH is 10x better than Parachutes, bar none. And all you nay sayers might as well cry back home to mommy and tell her you wet your sheets, again.
0843174218|5.0|As a child, I read these books when my family was stationed in England.  My mother bought my first Mr. Men book and I learned to love it.  I was always excited about getting another book and would frequently beg my mother for one.  I remember reading them for hours upon hours. As a child, I collected all of the Mr. Men books in the series and a few Miss books.  <br /> <br />Now I have a son who is turning 5 years old.  I have pulled out my old copies (I kept them since I loved them so much) and we are reading 3 different books a night. My child says that besides \\"Thomas and the Big, Big, Bridge,\\" he loves the Mr. Men books the most. <br /> <br />These books provide a wide use of vocabulary which helps children's mind to grow intellectually.  These books also  provide questions for the kids to keep them involved in the story.  Best of all, they are silly and fun.
630027120X|5.0|The Mission continues to be one of my all time favorite films. The sceanography of the Amazon jungle is breathtaking not only because of its vast beauty, but because of the context; Watching De Niro clamoring up the precarious falls is just one of the many images that elicits a holding of one's breath.  <br /> <br />The other major reason that I am profoundly impressed each time I watch this film is its poignant fictional representation of how the Vatican and the Catholic European monarchs of the colonial period prioritized profiteering and political intrigue over winning souls. It betrayed the innocents and sanctioned their massacre and slavery by turning away and shrugging it off with a tear(reminiscent of WWII). <br /> <br />As any great movie elicits a strong emotional reaction from its audience, this one elicits a flood of grief and appropriately righteous indignation at the sickening atrocities and social injustices of the \\"civilized Christians\\" against a people who had no real defense against the subjugation of militarily more advanced colonizers.  <br /> <br />Here we see a fictitious yet historically accurate account of how, once again, the powers and principalities of the day will justify their own gain and security at the ex pence of others rather than doing what is right ethically and, ironically, that which is truly representative of Christianity.  <br /> <br />There are many other components of this story of which one can ponder and discuss, such as the quality of the acting of the children and the politics of the 16th and 17th century Jesuits, the early \\"Liberation Theologists\\", and martyrdom, social anthropology, ethnography and the affect on a primitive culture by exposure to another in the attempt to study it(or 'help' it), existentialism, mysticism, global politics and commerce, labor out-sourcing...just to name a few.  <br /> <br />Politics and religious ethics aside, The Mission is a gorgeous, visually rich film with what can be considered one of the best casts imaginable performing their utmost best...what more could anyone expect of a film...if it were re-released it would be among the few movies worth paying to see in theaters. Also, if it were released as a DVD it would be one of the handful of movies worth owning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007Y08QA|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen so far this year. Christian Bale is such a talented actor not to mention his weight loss for the movie. Recommended!
B000062YB1|5.0|When I was first interested in Slayer, I was a little skepticle that they would be somewhat Satanic, but the closest to that that you will get is their album covers and song titles.  If anything, they might be anti-religion, at least God Hates us All (and Kerry King) is.  Tom Araya (lead vocals, bass) is catholic.  Anyway I don't dive into their lyrics (I don't think anyone does) I just listen to their music becasue it's awsome.  This album blew past me like a freight train with a little more melody and refrain than Divine Intervention, which was the first Slayer album I heard.  It's definately better than God Hates.  I am now a little skepticle of Diabolus, since I have read that it's the same style of God Hates.  Anyway, I'll be back to review Decade of Aggression once I've finished listening to it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|\\"rather than a revolutionary or experimental makover, but, hey, look how far Radiohead went downhill when they tried that.\\"  hey idiot, these are the facts: Radiohead did NOT go downhill, they became a better band (which is saying a lot since they were great to begin with). So just go sit in the corner and let the adults talk you ignorant piece of trash.     Coldplay is compared to Radiohead a lot. Fact of the matter is, Radiohead is way better than Coldplay ever was or ever could be. But I am not saying at all that I hate Coldplay, but I did read many people do. Those people have no place listening to music at all really, they just can't grasp intelligence and it takes them quite a long time to just register everything that's coming out of the stereo. Either that or they are stupid juvenile emocore/pop listeners, whatever, it's all their loss. Coldplay is great, buy this CD.:D    \\"To the reviewer known as Alan Hargrove (a.k.a. \\"tool\\"), for you to call someone an \\"ignorant piece of trash\\" for stating his opinion about Radiohead is simply vicious and shows little class. You're obviously a Radiohead nuthugger, and if that's your thing, cool.     Personally, I can't stand people like you...pseudo-trendy music snobs who think they have their finger on the pulse of everything that's cool. Don't get me wrong, I dig Radiohead. But people like you, the disillusioned MTV bastard children who still watch reruns of \\"My So Called Life\\" and don't think twice about affixing their mouths on Thom Yorke's sac for concert tickets, only anger me because you denounce the opinions of others who just so happen to disagree with you. Who's the piece of trash now? Jackass.\\"    First off, you know absolutely nothing about me, so all your insults and such are totally invalid and show how much of a hypocrite you really are. Don't talk about stuff you know nothing about.    You can't stand people like me because I obviously know more than you could ever hope to imagine. I never even watch MTV you stupid piece of s**t, and never will. I am far from trendy and I don't follow the crowd, so who's the jackass now? That's right, you are, now shut the f**k up before I do it for you by sticking my d**k in your mouth b*tch.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|This album is the weakest of the Jordan Rudess era DT releases.  Just kind of blah in spots, maybe the band should have taken a longer break after Train of Thought and the accompanying tour.  A bit disappointing.  I am hoping that DT will not be a band that just craps out as they get older....
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is considered Eminem's masterpiece by many critics and with such highly acclaimed(or hated) songs as \\"Kim\\", \\"Stan\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" it's very understandable.  This is also the album that made him a megastar swimming in controversy stemming from well publicized fueds with his mom, wife Kim, critics and just about everyone in the music industry. \\"Stan\\", cleverly using a Dido sample for the chorus, is written from an obsessed fan's point of view with Em reading Stan's fan mail and hearing his descent into homicidal madness progress with each letter.  Another concept that has never been done is \\"Kim\\", a prequal to THE SLIM SHADY LP's \\"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\\" where we are taken on a vivid journey of the kidnapping and very graphic murder of his real life wife Kim.  Shock has never been a more valuble tool than in this song.  There are also plenty of jabs at everyone from 'Nsync and Christina Aguilera to Insane Clown Posse on songs like \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" and others.  The production ranges from outstanding to less than par for this record, but with Em's incredible rymes and storytelling abilities even the lamest beat could be turned into a classic song.

B000006IUQ|4.0|David Mamet's trademark dialogue is present in THE EDGE, a film that is buoyed by its stars performances and some truly disturbing scenes featuring Bart the Bear.  Anthony Hopkins is a billionaire who accompanies his model wife (Elle McPherson) on a photo shoot in the Canadian wilderness.  The cinematography brilliantly captures the immense wilderness beautifully.  Hopkins is invited by his wife's manager (an effective Alec Baldwin) to join him on a brief flight north to get an Indian for a model.  Harold Perrineau Jr. as Steve accompanies the two but the trip becomes a nightmare when a bizarre accident downs the plane and leaves the three survivors to find their way to rescue.  Of course, Hopkins suspects Baldwin of having an affair with his wife, and is sure Baldwin is going to kill him to get her and his vast fortune.  Bart the Bear begins stalking the survivors and in a particularly horrifying scene, devours Perrineau, leaving Hopkins and Baldwin on their own.<br /><br />Mamet's script tends to be a little too literary but it doesn't diminish the impact of the situation, and Hopkins is typically brilliant as the billionaire.<br /><br />THE EDGE is worthwhile entertainment and is to be commended on its viscerality and portrayal of the ordinary man up against the extraordinary.
B0000508U6|5.0|hey Adam D., we know you are a stupid kid, you don't need to prove anymore that you are. we all know you should go back listening to your emocore/pop-\\"punk\\" \\"music.\\" and we all know you are just an ignorant slob who has no idea what he is talking about. so I will just say these two words before I leave: shut up.
B0000028M7|5.0|I don't think words could express how good this album is.  This is Alice in her prime.  This is by far their best album.  It mixes hard rock with mini-metal to create a wonderful album.  The best and most famous off of the album is Rooster.  You may know the story about it so I will be brief.  Its about Jerry Cantrell's dad.  He was nicknamed Rooster in the army.  So there ya go.  I think that this inspired some of the artist today because if you listen to Union Underground [ I realize this band's album that i'm talking about was like 4-5 years ago but irregardless] you will notice that he 'sings' the same way.  I highly recommend this album and this is also one of the few albums that that you can really like the first listen. <br /> <br />* The best songs would include Rooster, Would?, Down In a Hole[2nd best and a VERY VERY VERY good song], Angry Chair[third best],Dam That River, and last but not least Them Bones.
B00006690G|5.0|Excellent climax to a trilogy of great albums: THE SLIM SHADY LP, THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP and THE EMINEM SHOW.  Arguably Eminem's finest masterpiece.  Em has become a true master of his talents on this LP, perfecting his flow to maneuver in and out of the finest produced beats of any of his albums with the some of the tightest rymes in rap ever.  He is the master of manipulating the sound of words in the same way that Jay-Z is the master of manipulating the meanings of words.  While leaving behind a little of the abstact lyrics that made other albums so fascinating and colorful, he opens up even more than on past albums penning a song about his little girl Hailie(\\"Halie's Song\\") where he actually attempts to sing.  He also becomes more specific about the legendary troubles with his mother on \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\".  He also reflects quite a bit on his status as a major pop celebrity in such songs as \\"White America\\" and \\"Sing For The Moment\\" which samples Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\".  THE EMINEM SHOW is the perfect title for this album because Eminem puts on a better reality show with lyrics alone than most celebrities do with a TV show.  While it doesn't have the ground breaking stand out songs like \\"Stan\\" and \\"Kim\\" from THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP, this is probably the most solid of all of Em's albums and being released earlier in the same year as 8 MILE probably signified the pinnacle of one of the most spectacular careers in recent popular music.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down is possibly my favorite band.  I've been hooked right from album number one. <br /> <br />System of a Down do what any good band would wish themselves to do, & that is, maintain a certain genre & feel that is their own, but never to copy themselves over from past material. This puts a justification on my following statement; Mesmerize is just like all the other albums, in that it isn't the same.  <br /> <br />Let's run through the tracks. <br /> <br />1 - Soldier Side.  This is just a little introduction to the album. Basic, soft riff & some powerful words to kick off the new album. <br /> <br />2 - B.Y.O.B. (Bring Your Own Bombs). Power track. This is the first single from Mezmerize. Heavy, fast verse pacing for the  drums & guitar, & a slower, catchy, almost taunting chorus, this is a great kickoff to the album with System's anti-war message rumbling into your ears.  Good lyrical content that can only be expected of SOAD. This single's video is quite well-done as well.  I particularly like the helmets passing by that read things like \\"God\\".  Clever. <br /> <br />3 - Revenga. This is a hyped up song with very fast vocals from Serj, which I've come to love. It's got a real great flow to the lyrics / instruments. My sweet revenge / Will be yours / For the taking / It's in the making baby.  This track is practically impossible to skip, it jumpstarts your brain (if it's possible to skip any System song). <br /> <br />4 - Cigaro.  Not a favorite track, but catchy as all hell. This is one of those songs that pops up on every System album that has a weird flow to it, & doesn't make much obvious sense, but you wind up always listening to anyways.  Cool / In denial / We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar.  Makes you want to get up & bang your head a little bit. Or smack it off a wall.  Decent track just the same. <br /> <br />5 - Radio/Video.  Liking every System track I've heard thus far (ecluding that song with Wu-Tang), it's weird to say it, but this song rather annoys me.  I don't hate it, or even really dislike it, but it's not something I'd recommend to start with to a new System listener or something like that. Has some good points to it, I just dislike the chorus & the way it flows. <br /> <br />6 - This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song.  This is a ridiculous song, in a good way. Pumped up, catchy, & it makes your head spin. Gotta love that.  There's nothing wrong with me / There's something wrong with you / I hope your stepson doesn't eat the fish. ... weirdest part of this is, I think that underneath this craziness, lies a message. This song kind of makes you think. I wonder if that's a good thing or not. Don't ponder to deep. <br /> <br />7 - Violent Pornography. Catchy track that gets its point across quickly.  It's a lyrically very raw track, with a trippy little riff to it.  This is the one track I can't say much about, it kind of gets lost on me how to react. I don't know, but I like it.  <br /> <br />8 - Question!. Another great track. Original as it is, it puts you in mind of past System songs, which isn't a bad thing. It's intriquing, no more, no less.  Good, to-the-point lyrics, with a great flow that blends to them. I could see this as a future single.  It could make for a good video. <br /> <br />9 - Sad Statue. This has quickly become one of my favorite System songs. Says a lot about the way things are in the 21st century & how damaged society is at this point. Great lyrics, great mood. Good music, that doesn't outride the lyrics, which are the general focus for this track. Nothing is really outshined here, the whole song is brilliant. <br /> <br />10 - Old School Hollywood. A sort of heavy track, as far as the chorus goes at least. Lyrics are simple, & intended that way. It's a good song, very catchy in a weird kind of way.  It also sets up track 11 quite well. <br /> <br />11 - Lost In Hollywood. Daron takes over the lead vocals for this track, & does a superb job.The mood of this song is well-tuned to suit his singing voice.  Good lyrics, good imagery. Would make for a good single, a good video. Some people were disappointed with his extra vocal time, but I don't see the problem.  Daron is just as much a part of System as Serj, as is John, as is Shavo.  The guy can sing, they wanted to give him a chance, let him have it.  I think he holds up quite well. <br /> <br />Same old System, brand new album.  & it's awesome.
B0006L16N8|4.0|This is a great album that will sell zillions no doubt.  It's the first Coldplay album I've been able to listen to with much interest.  X&Y sounds eerily like mid-80's U2 (but this guitarist is no Edge and there doesn't appear to be much humor in Chris's presentation, but he sure does reek of sincerity).<br /><br />So musically I'm at a happy place with Coldplay.  Lyrically it's the same old I'm-oh-so-Sensitive rot that doesn't appeal to a crusty old dark dude like me. (\\"When you love someone but it goes to waste/ Could it be worse?\\"  That's supposed to be a profound and great lyric?  Wait til Gwyneth drops him and his record company tells him to get Steve Lillywhite to produce their next album to revive flagging sales.  It'll happen.  Then he'll know what's worse.)
B0007XT7V8|5.0|I picked this cd up because I plan on seeing them at Summerfest this year, and I wanted to know more then the 2 songs they play on the radio for the show. The cd overall is pretty damn catchy - the singer's voice is a little rough, but in a good way. The two songs that stand out to me the most is Santa Monica and Say Goodbye. Santa Monica is very melodic and Say Goodbye is a little edgier with that extra kick in the chorus. These 2 songs are sure to make it on your repeated song list.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|Yes, I'll admit this is sorta a flop.  But I mean is has some good hard rock songs on it.  They are Breadline and Crush Em'.  I think I like Enter the Arena more but whatever lol.  You can't blame a band for changing their sound.  The music scene is changing almost everyday.  This is overall a sorta 'subpar' good album.  Its a must for a collector so even if it does suck, you still have to have it, so why not just accept it?  So just go ahead and pick this up and suck it up bit****! rust in peace is over.  Peace sells is over.  Its time to move on.  It was a pain in the a** for me, but life goes on.
0596009208|5.0|When I first opened this book I thought it looked very confusing, but when I started reading it, it was a totally different story. I really enjoyed reading the book, and this is the first time this has happened when reading computer books. I was actually wondering what was going to happen on the next page, just as if I was reading a novel. When I finished the book, I felt a bit sad, I wanted MORE. <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|Alright, so Aenima is a great album, the best tracks being \\"H.\\" \\"Forty-six and two\\" and \\"Stinkfist.\\"  Its unfortunate that people hate this album, as its actually a great work of art.  I can't beleive some people are recommending pop-punk acts like Simple Plan or GC.  Those bands make quick 3 minute thrown together tracks that leave no lasting impression. Tool makes 7 minute (or more) long masterpieces that change one's whole outlook on life.  Also, Tool fans don't follow blindly, we like Tool because we enjoy their message/music.  We were told to think for ourself, we decided Tool was a kick-bootay band, people get upset that we like them.  So what?  We can handle that, you pay a price for where you stand.  Also, yes they're anit-Christian, I am a Christian and I listen to Tool, they are just expressing their beliefs, they think for themselves, so do I.  Also, Tool does makes music that appeals only to certain people, if their music doen't appeal to you, too bad, don't listen to them.  I respect people's opinions, they're thinking for themselves.  But if you want to give Tool's music a try, pick up Undertow, listen to it for 3-4 months or so, then pick this CD up.  This is not the best album to get into Tool with.  If your already into Tool, I suggest you buy it, but think for yourself etc.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|OKAY, HERE IS THE THING... I HAVE LIKED A7X FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW AND LIKED HIS VOICE PROGRESSION OVER THE YEARS, BUT THIS CD IS THE MOST WATERED DOWN P*SS I HAVE EVER HEARD.  THR MUSIC IS GOOD, BUT IF I WANTED TO HEAR THIS STYLE I'D LISTEN TO 80'S HAIR BANDS...  NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.  THIS CD IS NOT WORTH BUYING, MAYBE BURNING.  I FOR ONE WILL BE SELLING MINE BACK TO THE STORE.  HOPE NEXT CD IS BETTER
B0000942LT|2.0|Remember the time when Staind was full of rage and pain and tended to scream a lot? Those days look like they're over. The album was a big disappointment when you realize the almost instant progression from hard rock to teenage girl-friendly ballads. Don't get me wrong - I really enjoyed \\"So Far Away\\" as a single, but the entire cd seemed to be lacking the edge that made Staind so amazing in the beginning. I hope their newest album that comes out this month has a little more edge that the old school Staind fans are craving.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|As far as i'm concerned, I don't think the band remaining with the same sound is a bad thing.  Past experience tells me that 90% percent of the time when a band change their sound, its not that good.  I think this album is really great.  Coming out in 2003, While not a best seller, still got a lot of praise.  The songs on the album are top notch.  I really don't think there's a bad song on here.  The best song on here is Serenity.  A lot of people would disagree and choose I Stand Alone, or Straight Out of Line, but they are not as put together as Serenity.  The rest of the songs are good too.  So with that said, I recommend you go and pick this up.  I know you had to hear a piece of their music somewhere and if you liked that, you will like this album.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I love this CD but they keep changing I want to hear more songs like erotomania and metropolis part 1,a very complex and off beat song,I do like this album but its no Awake or Images and Words in my opinion
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay, while maybe not being the most incredible, blow your mind musicians, know how to write good songs.  They consistantly put out great albums.  I love John Bucklands guitar sounds on all of their albums.  If you enjoy good music you might like this CD.
B0009OPO0S|5.0|I love this whole CD. I got the DualDisc version and the extras are great. In the interview she did, she said that every song is different and I like that every song has a different feel. Each song was captured in a moment, in a feeling. I find this refreshing. I mean, with every song being the same kind of beat or same kind of instruments, makes things kinda dull. With every song in corporating a different genre of music, it spices things up a bit.  <br /> <br />I can't wait for Oral Fixation vol 2 in November! I'm gonna get that too.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I bought this CD because of \\"Speed of Sound\\" which I've been playing non-stop for a couple weeks now - BUT, the rest of the CD just isn't as catchy.  Some decent songs, but not as moving as \\"Rush of Blood\\".  Strangely, it has an early U2 sound to it. <br /> <br />Maybe I'll like it better with more listening, but right now it gets just a 3, maybe 3 1/2.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I'll start by saying that anyone who disses this album is just plain out retarded.  This album wasn't produced to be a best seller.  It was just to put rare songs and songs over the years that didn't make the other albums together.  Yes, this album has flaws.  Some of the songs are sorta bad but a lot are good though.  Mr. Jack is a prime example.  The song kicks ass.  Roulette, one of my favorite System of a Down songs.  I'll tell ya, these boys know how to make a metal 'ballad' song.  Boom is a song that makes you hate your government.  Yes, its wrong.  Yes, its disrespectful.  BUT ITS TRUE.  I don't think they would make a political song this extreme for it to be false.  This isn't a 50 cent/ja rule battle, this is life.  So overall, the album is great and recommended.  The worst of all the albums but certainly not a bad album.  Pick it up and enjoy.  The album kicks major ass, especially the government.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Wow, wow, wow. Hmm this is really hard to review because its so odd and a complete unexpected twist. It almost seems lame, but i can't stick a bad review on it because i love how it sounds! The songs are longer and more epic. The riffs are mostly really good too. First of all, the lead singer mimics about 20 different voices such as james from metallica and lemmy from motorhead, but they put their own gothic twist on it to make it interesting. This was the last thing I saw coming, and im actually proud of the effort. Most of the song writing is really good and I can't say its a sellout cd. Its really amazing and great because its so diverse from everything else out there. However, I can see some old fans being really dissapointed. I happen to like it more than any other cd they put out and i highly reccomend it. Heres a brief song review <br />1. Beast and the harlot 3/5 &lt; metallica rip off, but somewhat good <br />2. Burn it down 4/5, really awesome fast piece and his voice sounds really awesome. Love it! <br />3. Blinded in chains 5/5 AWESOME, the first time i heard it i knew it would be my favorite song. So amazing <br />4. Bat Country 4/5, this song prob. screams more than any other song, which makes it a really good piece and very different from everything else on the cd. <br />5. Trashed and Scattered 4/5 - just a great song <br />6. Seize the day 3/5, a decent ballad with corny lyrics <br />7. Sidewinder 4/5 - just a good song <br />8. The Wicked End 3/5 - Weird riff but pretty good, metallica rip off once again <br />9. Strength of the world 5/5 - Awesome song, great intro, and i find it hard to not play all the way through. His voice sounds really cool too. <br />10. Betrayed - 3/5 I dont like how the riff sounds, and it just bores me <br />11. M.I.A. 4/5 - interesting and good closing track. <br /> <br /> <br />
0393035158|5.0|There is no reason that reason needs to wear a veil whenever she ventures out in public. The rules of civil discourse must change such that we can intelligently address, as this book does, the important issues of our time. The modern equivalent of the flat earth society has been out there making some absurd decisions about our lives and our future. Unless we stop them soon humanity will be handicapped for quite a while. Sam Harris tells us the way to come out of the closet and argue effectively with the Christian Right who may mean well but who are doing a pretty good job of screwing things up badly. For instance, no rational approach to ethics would have us stop stem cell research. Our present official policy is shaped by beliefs that are divorced from every reasonable understanding of biology. As a neurologist I can assure you that we visit more suffering on a fly by killing it, then we visit on a blastocyst, to say nothing of a zygote. This book is a good place to start to arm yourself against the hooey and baloney that the Bush administration is throwing our way everyday.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|If you have ADD and need a soundtrack for you life, this is your band. I can't believe they did it again, the random schitzophrenia that bleeds from their music is simply without equal. Even if you do not agree with thier politics you have to agree that they are one of the most creative bands to come along in a very long time, even 10 years old the band still remains without anyone on their level. Amazing vocals, amazing musicianship, excellent humor laden lyrics and beats, with a dark undertone. Daron Malakian's vocals are tight and add even more randomness to the listening experience.    5 thumbs up! AND this stuff is clean and hits deep if you have a system in your car.
B0006L16N8|5.0|\\"X&Y\\" proves that Coldplay is worthy of all their great praise and hype. This is one of the best albums of 2005. I feel that a new or old fan can readily enjoy this album. It just keeps getting better each time I play it. Coldply continues to define their sound on this CD with even greater clarity than before. While they are comparable to U2, I think they are finally stepping out of their shadow with \\"X&Y.\\" Chris Martin's distinct voice is even sharper and more effective this time around. I would highly recommend this album.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Fijacion Oral will bring together Shakira fans and music lovers alike.  Listening to it is like taking a trip through decades of culture with the latin beauty at your side.  From classic Shakira tunes like 'Dia de Enero' to Bossa Nova-inspired ballads like 'Obtener Un Si' you will not be bored by any tracks on this album.  She jumps into an 80's style song with 'Las de la Intuicion' and then a Tori-esque lullaby with the acoustic version of 'La Pared.'  Some have said her rhythms are copied and calculated, but as with all Shakira songs the true magic is in her lyrics.  By adding instances of French and German she proves that no matter what language she sings in, she will reach your soul and teach you what she knows.<br /><br />The dual disc contains great DVD features like lyrics in Spanish and English, music videos, personal footage with Alejandro and a making of \\"La Tortura.\\"  I personally can't wait for Vol. 2 to be released in November!
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|This film depended much more on action and special effects than its predecessor, which used Damon's and Potente's chemistry and acting abilities. I think Potente was a powerful, under appreciated element in \\"Identity\\" but in the sequel she was immediately killed off, leaving Jason to scowl, frown, track, and kill. I wonder how few words he actually said in this movie after Marie was killed. Now Brian Cox's character is dead which I think will hurt future sequels.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|The Great Dividers - 4/5 <br />Failure - 4/5 <br />This Lying World - 5/5 <br />Black Hearts Now Reign - 5/5 <br />Zombie Autopilot - 5/5 (definite favorite) <br />Bloodlust to the Human Condition - 4/5 <br />Lie to Purify - 4/5 <br />Endless - 5/5 <br />Aries - 4/5 (idk but I like it) <br />Predetermined Sky - 4/5 <br />False Idols - 4/5
B0006L16N8|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of Coldplay to begin with. They're a nice, simple alternative rock band with nice simple love songs and pleasing progressions and melodies, but Coldplay are not reinventing the wheel here. All the doting reviews on amazon for this album bring to mind Radiohead's Thom Yorke and his dismissal of Coldplay as \\"Lifestyle Music.\\" This album, I feel, justifies the remark.<br /><br />Instead of joining in on the Chris Martin circle-jerk, I'm going to be honest and say that I'm just not that impressed by this album. It's nice and everything, but there just isn't much to grab my attention. Unlike Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head (which is a guilty pleasure of mine,) There just isn't a whole lot here that jumps out at me. Coldplay has suddenly decided that they very badly want to be U2, and the most predictable and skip-able aspects of A Rush of Blood to the Head form the groundwork for the majority of this album.<br /><br />Again, it's still enjoyable and has it's moments. Even though the verse of \\"Speed of Sound\\" is like the dull bastard child of a bad U2 song and \\"Clocks,\\" the soaring, emotionally over-the-top chorus and pre-chorus are perfect examples of why I still listen to Coldplay. The Pink Floydian synth intro to \\"Square One\\" got my hopes up (far too soon) and indeed the rest of the song is pretty good. The progression is different and the subtle electronics are at least tasteful. The sort of Depeche Mode, new wave groove is something different from Coldplay. \\"White Shadows\\" starts out slightly out of character for Coldplay, and is actually pretty dark sounding. \\"Talk\\" sounds like a likely candidate for the next single and has a memorable guitar hook that, again, brings to mind U2. Another nod to dark 80's synth pop is \\"Low,\\" probably my favorite song on the album. \\"'Till Kingdom Come\\" is also a nice treat, bringing back some of the folksy charm that persists throughout Parachutes.<br /><br />This album stands out when Coldplay is trying something new, but unfortunately that doesn't happen much on these songs. Most of the other songs on this album fall into that vague, forgettable pop tune category. They bring to mind phrases like \\"well that's nice\\" and \\"what the hell did I just listen to?\\" A lot of this is a diluted rehashing of the worst parts of A Rush of Blood to the Head. It's sad, but I think Coldplay are now slaves to the reactive American rock radio industry. Producers and record execs have a leash on the band's creative potential, and Coldplay aren't even going to try and break free at this point - would you want to take risks if you were the most masturbated-to band in the world right now?<br /><br />I'll give the record multiple spins, in hopes the remaining songs will grow on me, but my initial reaction to it is to be very underwhelmed. If you like nice, easy to digest singsongs, go ahead and pick it up, but don't expect to have your mind blown.trying something new, but unfortunately that doesn't happen much on these songs.

B00030590I|5.0|This film is a masterpiece of all genres. Please try seeing the movie before reading too much about it. It will surprise you. Other reviewers will tell you the ins and outs of the plot, the making, etc. DO NOT READ THEM BEFORE YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE. And enjoy!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|It is very annoying that people are becoming upset with the fact that Avenged Sevenfold's brutal riffs have been replaced by thrashing and melodic solos.  Does that mean that solos are no longer as good as those \\"power riffs\\" that get repetitive after awhile?  Of course not.  One reason why I love the new Avenged Sevenfold CD is that Synster Gates (guitarist) and Zacky Vengence work better then ever together, creating overlaying guitar solos and melodies that sound amazing. <br /> <br />1. Beast And The Harlot - This song, I heard when it was leaked.  This song was great when it first came out with a blistering solo and some great drum lines, but now, it has kind of worn out on me. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />2. Burn It Down - Has a very cool guitar riff at the beginning and then from there, the song does the usual Avenged Sevenfold routine: M. Shadows lets his voice hit high notes, and then right in the middle, the song breaks into a thrash metal solo, and then it goes soft again. 9/10 <br /> <br />3. Blinded In Chains - A somewhat average song, but the drum roll about 2:50 into the song is pretty awesome.  I didn't really like the song that much at first, but once again, it's Synster Gates and Zacky Vengence's guitars that make me like the song. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />4. Bat Country - This song is one that I REALLY didn't like at first, but it grew on me the more I listened to it.  The solo in the middle of the song is amazing, has a almost halloweenesque feel to it.  However, the lyrics are a bit cheesy.  In fact, the lyrics to the whole CD are a bit corny. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Trashed And Scattered - My second favorite song on the CD.  It's very brutal, fast, and you can really hear the bass on this song.  I personally think this should be their first single, as opposed to Bat Country. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Seize The Day - I think if you liked Guns And Roses nice soft songs, you'll like this one.  However, I like Guns And Roses soft songs, but this one REALLY didn't grow on me.  The only thing enjoyable about it was the solo in the middle that was reminiscent of Slash. 7/10 <br /> <br />7. Sidewinder - A pretty good song, although it's a bit inconsistent.  I thought the acoustic solo at the end was very impressive.  Not my favorite, but then again, a very strong track. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />8. The Wicked End - A very fast and enthralling song.  I really liked Shadows voice on this song for some reason, it just seemed more gruff then ever.  For people who don't like the fact he doesn't scream anymore, well, I think that its a step in a new direction, and I like the direction they're taking. 9/10 <br /> <br />9. Strength Of The World - By far, my favorite track on the CD.  The song starts off in a very classical mood and then breaks into a very awesome thrash song.  At about 6:40, Synster Gates breaks into his greatest solo to date ( I believe).  Overall, this song is just perfect. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. Betrayed - I was looking forward to hearing this song, since it was supposedly about the murder of Dimebag Darrell, but I was disappointed with this song.  It was kind of boring, and had an awful opening riff to the song. 7/10 <br /> <br />11. M.I.A - Probably my third favorite.  I love the chorus of the song, and its amazing at the end, when a choir kicks in.  Very great closing to a VERY good CD 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Overall, I think that this CD even outdoes it's predecessor, Waking The Fallen (I loved Waking The Fallen) and it blows Sounding The Seventh Trumpet out of the water.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|What a bunch of whiners! Yes, DVD's are released over and over as initial releases and then special edition(s). This is not \\"scandalous\\" as one reviewer put it - it's business. Of course the studios and distributors are going to add more stuff and get more of your money. Get over it. For the most part, DVD's are so inexpensive now (the new Special Edition 30th Anniversary of Jaws is only $16.99 at Amazon) that they're practically throw-aways after a couple of years (when the newer special edition comes out). For pricier compilations such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, you should just sit on your hands and wait until the more expensive multi-gazillion disk set is released. If you buy them individually and then get mad because you have to buy them all over again it's your own fault for not waiting.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|A script so good that even Sandra Bullock's annoying presence can't mess it up. There are still some typical \\"Sandra\\" moments, but for the most part in this movie, you forget you are watching her, and it's a great film. This is a comedy. <br /> <br />I have this DVD and watched it with commentary. I must say the director came off like a complete ass, but maybe she had a bad day. There are other cute features, like instructions on how to make a gum-wrapper chain like Sandra makes in the movie. <br /> <br />Basic storyline: <br />Gwen is a party girl who gets busted for a DUI. She is sentenced to rehab. At first she thinks rehab is whack and cheesy. She doesnt participate with the others, and has her party-boy boyfriend sneak her drugs. But then she starts to think she really may have a problem. Will Gwen straighten up, or continue with her partying ways? Will she accept the proposal of her drunk-druggie boyfriend? <br /> <br />This movie is above all a comedy. The addicts will make you laugh, Gwen's reaction to them will make you laugh. Steve Buschemi plays a rehab counselor, and while he isn't funny in this role, he is interesting. <br /> <br />There are a few sub-plots. Gwen's rehab roomie is a teenage heroin addict. Also, a major-league pitcher (sex addict, druggie) comes to rehab and bonds with Gwen. These arent too detracting from Gwen and in fact it would be boring if the whole movie was just about her. <br /> <br />I don't think this movie did so well, and that's why you can get the DVD for cheap. If you have ever had a drug or alcohol problem, this movie will seem a lot funnier to you, than to someone who has never been into any of that. <br /> <br />I guess the bottom line is that people should not just brush this off as a \\"Sandra Bullock movie\\". I have seen a lot of her movies and this is definitely the best. It isn't brainless comedy. It isn't genius either, but it is definitely enjoyable and I think worth a purchase. <br /> <br />
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Octavarium... <br />8 songs for their 8th album. <br />The first song... <br />Great! <br />I think, it's the best song on the album. <br />The ballad was good, but not great. <br />The rest of the album is great. <br />It's good for any Dream Theater fan. <br />But, if you're just now getting into them, check out some of their earlier stuff. <br />This album is nowhere near as heavy as Train Of Thought. <br />But, as a progressive band... <br />They always try new things, experiment, and raising the bar. <br />I rated this album 4 stars. <br />Because, there's always room for improvement. <br /> <br />-p.s.- Where's John Petrucci's solo's? I think, since he's releasing a solo album, he's saving all his good solos for his album. Because, he's the man, but Jordan stole the show. Which I'm upset about, because I hate keyboard solos, I would rather hear an extra guitar solo anyday! :) <br />
B0001XAS2G|5.0|Sigh... if only Al Stewart and Alan Parsons were working together again - they were perfect musical soulmates not unlike Lennon/McCartney. When you get right down to it, Al is really a folkie troubadour; as such, I'm convinced that these tunes wouldn't be anywhere near as fleshed out if it weren't for Alan Parsons' musical guidance and sound expertise - and the end result is a sonic masterpiece. If you were to get only two Al Stewart CDs, it would have to be the ones where AP was working the soundboard - \\"Year Of The Cat\\" and this one. Highly recommended.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|DReam Theater mentioned they were smooth there edges by making there songs shorter more contained this effort. At times of listerning istarted to believed him........kind of. The album is still pakced with technical hoo-ha. every which way theres solo and a solo here, and dream theater havent sound more cluttered with speed. but the band is starting to slim down there meaty jams.showcased best in the furious and chaotic \\"panic attack\\" or the loud-soft dinamics of  \\"these walls\\", the band, if lack for a better word havent sounded more accessible and at times a pleasure to the ears. Labrie dabbles with new vocal versatality rather than shooting for sheer range he adds more emotive uncertainy to his voice making it more complex then ever, and the inclusion of vocal dual vocal harmonies adds alot. showcasing this well on Muse-esque rip \\"never enough\\". Sadly some new choices dont work as well. The addition of orchestrations made sense from the begining but sadly its unevenly used. making songs like \\"the answer lies\\" within more syrupy then they should be (all they are anyways thanks to Labrie's breathy cringe worthy ballad tone), it sounds similar to the many corny ballad of the 80's.else where theres the lyrically well written but kind of uncompelling sounding \\"sacrficed sons\\" with its weird yet corny guitar harmonies....though it blasts into high later in. and the enormous closer \\"octavarium\\" features impressibely amibent intro followed by accousticballadry parts following through with heavy to silly keyboards (a jing bells like ripped melody is thrown for laughable effect) and closing withe a big bang....its probablly the most awkward song they've ever written. At this point the band isnt quite sure what they want to do at this point. they sound consistently awkward explorning new dynamics, and lyrically there concepts are reaching to the poiint of inanity....making a   such a large sound to something such as a drinking problem (\\"root of all evil\\") or how you kiss upto yer fans with nothing in return (\\"never enough\\"). i certiainly feel for pourtnoy but desperation is slipping to the surface and it doesnt show to well. despite some nice attempts this album isnt likely to win over any new fans or keep people like me any more or less at bay
B000BTC5LW|1.0|Waited so long for this dvd to come out.Bought one took it back what did they do to the dvd Nothing.Totally dissapointed in everything Picture quality, Audio,What am I missing that everyone is talking about.Its the best dvd by P- F.My opinion Its the worst.Watched all extras Urinals Gilmour throwing lamp across room in hotel.Band saying it sucks to be in rock group. Band ask how it feels to work with rock star.Let you know when I find one:people say this is a great 2 set dvd.Is everyone  deaf dumb & blind? I feel Its nothing more than a remake of the VHS.With some extras  not that great to watch I give this 2 set dvd a -10.
B000059HB7|5.0|\\"Rio Bravo\\" is Wayne's best movie ever (tied with \\"Big Jake\\" and \\"Angel and the Badman\\").  It is a funny film, while at the same time being serious.  Most films that try this combination tend to flop, but \\"Rio Bravo\\" blends the two effortlessly.  Wayne, Dean Martin, and Walter Brennan make an excellant acting trio, and the movie is fast-moving and fun to watch.  Films like this make me wish Hollywood still made them this good.
B000002VCU|4.0|As chance would have it, it took Eric Woolfson to step out of the shadows and up to the microphone before the Alan Parsons Project ever got any AM airplay. This album is first-rate all the way, scoring two big hits with \\"Time\\" and \\"Games People Play\\", although my personal favourite is the instrumental \\"The Gold Bug\\". Highly recommended.
B0007XT87G|3.0|while in absentia so tight and well structured.......and was a prog album....Deadwing sounds pretty loose. The album centers around traditional prog elements of \\"building upon\\". The songs are very ambient and very loose and dont rush things in every term of the word.Its broad but also underwhelming.Songs like \\"Melotron Scratch\\" are slow burning and are aided mostly by Steve Wilsons haunting vocal harmonies. \\"ariving Somehere but not here\\" is a 12 minute jam with some nice jazzy turns but its far too meandering and drawn to make for focused attention. The bands soft soothing yet hauntingness works to best effect here on the number \\"lazurus\\" with a trinkling piano floating wa-wa guitar riff. The album is saved from meandering limbo by the heavier numbers by (the-soing-that-will-probablly-make-them-big) <br />\\"shallow\\" and as well as the driving and kind of funky bass line in \\"halo\\" as well the darkly tinged and anthemic \\"open car\\". Its really not gunna do mtoo much for In Abesntia fans like myself...but shows the different if slightly more troubling colors on Porcupine Tree....go in at your own risk
B0006L16N8|2.0|Where are those instrumental and melodic hooks that defined this band?  The haunting, and beautifully simple guitar parts which struck you on \\"A Rush...\\" are either gone or are buried in a wall of dreary washes of sound, and the vocals drone and whine away without the resolution or glorious crescendo of the band's outstanding first two albums.  Everything sounds labored and overworked.  These poor guys must be buckling under the weight and hype of being \\"the new U2\\"...all those expectations.  I actually feel sorry for them.
B00080ZG10|4.0|It's easy to understand the mixed reviews even if one doesn't readily side with all of them.<br /><br />First, one cannot fault this production for its visual audacity. It looks and feels like a fascinating personal adventure. You'll remember it for its thrilling flying scenes. There's even a nail-biting rendition of the [in]famous FX-11 reconnaissance plane crash on a row of Beverly Hills townhouses.<br /><br />And that's not half of its appeal. We get a glimpse of it all -- inventions, glamor, tough romances, quotable quotes, explosive action, madness. The screenplay is riveting. A taut script chugs things along at a rapid clip.<br /><br />Helped by confident cameos from everyone, especially Cate Blanchett after one comes to terms with that farcical Hepburn accent. DiCaprio was hardly the right physique for the role if you've seen a pic of Hughes but his intensity and flair quickly make up for that inadequacy. Alan Ada sports phenomenal presence in the little bit of screen time he is accorded.<br /><br />No, the film is truly well made. I'd recommend it in a blink. It must have made a very, very close second to Million Dollar Baby, which took the cake for its simple yet hard-hitting emotional heft.<br /><br />The problem lies with the somewhat vacuous aftertaste one recalls the picture with, due in no small measure to its drawn-out ending that seemed enamored with the idea of meticulous bottling of human discharges.<br /><br />One wonders if Hughes was the only one wallowing in OCD; Scorcese seems so drunk on Hughes the Inventor's fervor that Hughes the Man gets a short shrift. Historical glitches I'm not qualified to mull over, but the version we see of his feats as aviator/inventor are watered-down at best. Why his obsessive bravado? Why the promiscuity in adult life? Why the egging psychosis?<br /><br />Two and half hours of this magnum opus and we end up none the wiser. Which is really quite tragic as the film had everything going for it.<br /><br />A 2-disc DVD should have made for a perfect avenue to fill the gaps and include canned scenes or some such, but we are subjected to half-hearted documentaries instead.<br /><br />That's two strikes on wasted opportunity.VD should have made for a perfect avenue to fill the gaps and include canned scenes or some such, but we are subjected to half-hearted documentaries instead.<br /><br />That's two strikes on wasted opportunity.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I got this for Christmas,I haven't watched this or Smallville season 2,yet.
B00097A5I6|1.0|You will never be the greatest rock and roll band in the world...however, I did really like that songbird song from your last album.  Maybe if you made more catchy songs liek that, you could be the greatest rock and roll band.
B00097A5HW|2.0|I think this album is very weak compared the previous ones.  Shakira was special because her songs were unique and edgy.  Most of the new songs sound very generic, like soap opera themes. The lyrics are corny.  I would only rescue La Tortura, Un Dia Especial and El Escondite Ingles.  Come on Shakira you are smart, sensual and worldly.  Stop holding up. We are ready to hear your grown up songs.  I hope the English CD has more to offer.  I want the rocker Shakira back !
6302787300|5.0|An interesting topic observed in the film 1492: Conquest of Paradise is the transcendental encounter among Europeans and the indigenous cultures of America.  Two completely different worlds meet on October 21, 1492.  According to the film, Colombus  feels that he and his men have found the Garden of Eden.  The natives do not seem to be a threat during Columbus's first voyage, for they even give artifacts to the Spaniards as a \\"sign of submission.\\"  I would say that the way in which the indigenous people are portrayed is by means of a realistic point of view.  The reason why I hold such idea is because the film does not seem to favor one group over the other.  There are scenes that show the cruelty in which some Spaniards treated the indigenous; similarly, the fact that the indigenous people also killed Europeans is brought up in the film. <br />The way in which Columbus is portrayed is both realistically and idealistically.  He is represented as a man with a \\"think outside the box\\" mentality.  His dreams are to reach for the stars and he challenges Spain's Catholic king and queen, as well as fights and wins a mental battle with himself and his crew when they believe they are doomed in the sea.  However, one of my uncertainties is whether or not Columbus truly felt that the indigenous people were equal to his men, as the film suggests.  Yes, Spaniards were forced to work and build cities as did the indigenous people, but was it to the same extent? <br />Religion plays a vital role in the film.  During Columbus's second voyage, a Catholic church and a bell are built.  Undoubtedly, religion serves as an instrument to \\"conquer.\\" <br />Other aspects of the encounter brought up in the video are the fact that the Europeans oppressed the indigenous people in every thinkable way and, indeed, mixed interracially with native women; the way in which Columbus searched for India; and the Europeans' lust for gold. <br />In conclusion, I would recommend the film, due to its historical value, as well as because of its awesome scenery, casting crew, and music. <br />
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Ive always been a big system fan, so I went into this album with great expectations only to come away sorely dissapointed.  Musically, its amazing. Lyrically, its a mess. Most songs only have a few lines that are repeated over, and over, and over, and could have been written by a 12 year-old.  Theres a few goods songs (namely Cigaro, Sad Statue, and Lost in Hollywood), but for every good song theres a bad one (Radio/Video, Violent Pornography?).  Download the three mentioned, and wait for \\"Hypnotize\\" this fall.
B0006L16N8|3.0|A Rush of Blood to the Head was better than this one.  But, the more I listen the better it gets!........................updated...this is a great CD now that I ahve listend to it....
B00009V7T2|5.0|When I first heard of this album, and this band, I didn't know what to expect. But I picked it up anyway, and popped it in my stereo like a good music fan. After I finished listening to it all the way through, I had no idea of what to make of 'Deloused'. But I felt compelled to keep listening, so then I listened to it for some more hours, on repeat, all the way through each time.  <br /> <br />Hours turned to days.  <br /> <br />Days turned to weeks.  <br /> <br />Before I knew it, 'Deloused in the Comatorium' was the recipient of two weeks of almost exclusive airtime. And no CD monopolizes my means of music production like that. Really great CDs usually get about 4 or 5 days with me. But Mars Volta was setting a dangerous precedent: I feared that I would soon learn to forget music, and only understand this. Except I still didn't know what the heck it was. <br /> <br />At about that time that I realized that I could not live without this CD. That was two months ago. It still owns the majority of my listening time, and yes, I still don't understand what the heck it is. But does that matter? <br /> <br />Just hear for yourself.
B00008H2LB|5.0|All of you who are bashing this album need to broaden your horizons a little bit. Of course the structure of Linkin Park's music is simplistic and the lyrics may seem \\"shallow\\" to some since they really only speak to a particular audience, those who are depressed and need some sort of help. But guess what? That's what WORKS for them, and that's what has made them one of the most popular musical groups of this era. While they don't exactly reinvent themselves on this album, they have pumped out another set of tracks that'll get your blood flowing; a list that is as good, if not better, than Hybrid Theory. Although there are no real complaints from me, let's review: <br /> <br />1)Foreword: Awesome introduction to Don't Stay. Very clever. <br />2)Don't Stay: A loud and effective beginning to this album. The ultimate breakup song, haha. <br />3)Somewhere I belong: As much as I hear this on the radio, I never get sick of it. I would have loved it if Chester had a screaming part in the bridge, but hey, it works. <br />4)Lying From You: Classic Linkin Park, lots of back and forth between Mike and Chester. Awesome. <br />5)Hit The Floor: Who says Chester doesn't scream on this album? The song is sort of thin, but the lyrics are powerful. <br />6)Easier To Run: A song with DEPTH. A little slower than what we're used to, but you still have Mike throwin' down the beats. I love it. <br />7)Faint: Makes you want to do 95 down the highway. Great lyrics, Chester screaming in the bridge. I love the fast paced stuff. <br />8)Figure 09: This song does not get the acclaim it deserves. It is probably one of my two favorites on the album. It gets your head pumping, it's got a great bridge, and it's CATCHY. I want this to be played on the radio! <br />9)Breaking The Habit: A lighter song, I tend to shy away from it on the album, but it's definitely a radio favorite for a reason. I think it's a very expressive and innovative song for LP, something that makes this album stand out againstHybrid Theory. <br />10)From The Inside: Like Easier To Run, a very deep song, great feel to it. This should have also gotten some radio time. <br />11)Nobody's Listening: Not much to this song, decent groove to it, the Japanese flute thing is cool. I love how they always try out new things like this. <br />12)Session: Took me a couple times to enjoy this. I like Cure For The Itch better than this, but it's still pretty cool. <br />12)Numb: SERIOUSLY overplayed on the radio, which I hate. But hey, that just makes it a good song, I suppose!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Not many singer/songwriters these days, would choose to follow the career path of Rufus Wainwright.  Having come from the 'Wainwright' family, of whom his mother, father (& now Sister), are all accomplished performers, musicians.  Rufus specialises in a theatrical form of expressive Chamber Pop/ Singer-songwriter music that takes in: Cabaret, Theatrical Pop, Adult orientated Pop/Rock, Adult Alternative & even opera & literate pop.  Shamelessly overblown and Passionate, some would argue that this form of sophisticated, literate music, died a century ago, along with the music it references, but you see, Rufus isn't your average Pop star.    \\"Oh What a World\\" rams home the point admirably, with a huge lush orchestrated sound, largely operatic in approach over which Rufus muses \\"Why am I always on a plane or a fast train, Oh what a world my parents gave me, Always Travelin' but not in love....\\", and chimes wonderfully with his cabaret-infused theatre pop, and the addition of plucked strings, only serve to highlight that Rufus is aiming for the highest echelons of Adult-orientated pop.    \\"I Don't Know What It Is\\", follows with a gradual, slow building melody, that solidifies critics various mentions that Rufus is something of a Renaissance man musically, with an ear for emotional complexity.  With a song that places an emphasis on melody and production, over which Rufus sings: \\"Take a lookin around At friendly faces, All declaring a war on far off places, Is there anyone else who is through with complaining about what's Done unto us\\" shows his sentiments, in no wavering fashion, but the richly textured and layered songs, belie the incisive wordplay.        \\"Vicious World\\" opens with gloriously shimmering strings and backing vocal harmonies, and gentle slow piano chords, with Rufus' delicate vocal intone of: \\"Thought that maybe we'd fall in love over the phone, Thought that maybe I'd really love being alone, Everybody but Heaven knows how I was wrong!!\\", in the softest and sweetest of vocal deliveries, it's feels like a extremely low-key ballad of the subtlest kind, and is as poignant as it is restrained, and neatly highlights some of the very broad musical scopes with which Rufus pitches his lyrical tent on which to draw upon, his multitude of musical influences.  This may be a little too subtle for some, but the albums refusal to follow conventional musical methods is extremely impressive.    \\"Pretty Things\\" is far more sombre in tone & mood, with the barest sketches of instrumentation (Piano, organ), making the perfect musical backdrop for Rufus to sing over, (think, midnight mood Torch-bearing chamber-pop), with the lyrical theme largely about not feeling guilty for liking pretty or superficial things, as Rufus boldly declares:  \\"Pretty things, so what if I like pretty things??, Pretty lies, so what if I like pretty lies??\\", without a dash of irony, and cleverly twisting the listeners disbelief at his superficiality, by saying: \\"This time will pass and with it will me, And all these pretty things......Don't say you don't notice them??\\"    And so there you have it.....gloriously pretentious, shamelessly overblown, impossibly romantic, and probably a little too literate & cerebral for widespread mainstream acceptance, it's pitches its tent firmly in the Adult-orientated market, and asks listeners to meet it, on Rufus' terms.  And frankly....some listeners may not want to, as the album has layers that are gradually peeled away, to reveal hidden depths of lyrical intricacies that will be missed the first time, knowing little references that will begin to make sense on repeated listens, and phrases lifted or modified from literature.  And few would argue that what Rufus, has created here, isn't uniquely his own!!, and so seemingly out of step with what music is currently being made, that you have to wonder, how many audacious & left field albums, can he make such as this, before his record label pulls the plug??  But then again, anything this bold, brave, artistic, painstakingly detailed or not easily catergorisiable, deserves all the (limited) recognition it can get.  Finally!!!....an artist not afraid to take chances, and have to simplify his music, in an effort to bend to the almighty dollar, or have to make a bland commercially viable album....and you know what???, his music is all the better for it.  Buy Now!!!
B0002OERI0|3.0|Well, Personally I liked Dookie the best.  It was a solid punk album anyway. <br /> <br />The one thing I hate about modern green day is that everyone thinks they are a punk anarchy band.  News flash: Green day isn't punk anymore!  It went out with Nimrod. <br /> <br />Now, American idiot...that's another story.  It's not even remotely punk, except for like two songs.  Green day has definately grown torward the pop genre in the last decade.  I'm not bashing them but they really aren't that good now.  Am I the only one that thinks BOBD is a bad song?  I mean, it's a frickin ballad...that's just gay. <br /> <br />Other than that, it's a solid pop album...buy it if you like pop, but please don't expect it to be like dookie or punk music. <br /> <br />Oh, and to the woman with the 13 year old girl who still plays with strawberry shortcake...I'm sure god understands that people need to get beyond stuff like that in life...eventually! <br />You need to realize that your innocent little teenager isn't gonna be playin with fake cell phones till she's twenty.  Get a life lady!  listen to some real music!
B0006L16N8|5.0|And so, for now, the world is divided into two camps - those who love this band and those who don't.  X&Y is part of the long view and I believe time will bring the two camps closer together.  Happy.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Thank God Coldplay didn't give up after two. X&Y is one of the most epic, sweeping, and gorgeous albums ever produced. The music is distinctly Coldplay, but at the same time, it's completely different from Parachutes and Rush of Blood. The sound is a lot lusher than the previous two. It's amazing that 4 people can produce a sound that seems so deeply layered and full. There should be no doubt whether or not to purchase this. If you liked Speed of Sound, buy it, because in my opinion, it's in the middle of the pack in terms of best tracks. And there is no way anyone can now compare them to Radiohead. With this album, Coldplay has cemented themselves as the modern-day Beatles. Be sure to catch them in concert this summer! <br /> <br />Top Tracks: <br /> <br />What If <br />White Shadows <br />Fix You <br />X&Y <br /> <br />
B0009OPO0S|5.0|I must say that I love shakira's new album!!  Although I went into it expecting to find the album sounding like \\"la tortura\\", which I must say is an excellent song, I was pleasently suprised.  Shakira really covers many different styles of music, and performs them successfully.  It is one of those albums that I can listen to straight through without skipping a song.  Truely great :)
B0006L16N8|3.0|When fans and critics said it will be hard to top \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", they were right and \\"X & Y\\" is proof of that.  Don't get me wrong; I'm a huge fan of Coldplay and I'm sure the diehards will love this album.  In fact, those fans would probably love anything they put out.  But those who are new to Coldplay will find \\"X & Y\\" ordinary, a rehash of some of their earlier works and works of other bands like The Cure and Franz Ferdinand.<br /><br />I know it's unfair to compare albums, especially comparing it to \\"A Rush of Blood...\\"; there's never going to be another album like it.  But when you have everyone proclaiming them to be \\"the next Beatles\\" and the band referring to people who don't like \\"X & Y\\" as \\"Coldplay haters\\", then you have no choice but to compare.  And when you do, you'll understand why I gave it only \\"3 stars\\".  They are far from being the next Beatles.<br /><br />\\"X & Y\\" contains a few catchy tunes, including its first single \\"Speed of Sound, \\"Talk\\" and \\"Swallowed In The Sea\\".  But as a whole, this album is somewhat forgetable.  The awesome guitar hooks that we grown to love from the first two albums cease to exist in this one.  \\"X & Y\\" is not bad; there are just better albums out there right now.  If you must get a Coldplay album, \\"A Rush of Blood...\\" would be my pick.  Or if you want something similar, try \\"Strange and Beautiful\\" by Aqualung or the mega hit \\"Hopes & Fears\\" by Keane.<br /><br />PS - I wonder how the first version of the 3rd album was like.  You know; the one they supposedly scrapped.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Let this album grow into you. It is certainly not their best but it is still worth listening.
B0006L16N8|5.0|To the reviewer known as Alan Hargrove (a.k.a. \\"tool\\"), for you to call someone an \\"ignorant piece of trash\\" for stating his opinion about Radiohead is simply vicious and shows little class.  You're obviously a Radiohead nuthugger, and if that's your thing, cool.   <br /> <br />Personally, I can't stand people like you...pseudo-trendy music snobs who think they have their finger on the pulse of everything that's cool.  Don't get me wrong, I dig Radiohead.  But people like you, the disillusioned MTV bastard children who still watch reruns of \\"My So Called Life\\" and don't think twice about affixing their mouths on Thom Yorke's sac for concert tickets, only anger me because you denounce the opinions of others who just so happen to disagree with you.  Who's the piece of trash now?  Jackass. <br /> <br />Yes...the album...great.  The signature Coldplay sound is very much intact, and Chris Martin's vocals sound terrific.  The title track is simply terrific.  Best Buy has it for under ten bucks now, so do yourselves a favor and get it now!  Other than that, I can't really add anything that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers. <br /> <br />Peace out everyone (you too, \\"tool\\").
B0009A1AS2|5.0|What is great about this band is what sets them apart. Every album they produce is entirely different. In the case of Octavarium DT has focused on song writing. Are a few of these songs more radio friendly? Absolutely. The fact of the matter is that you cannot please everyone. Hence the song \\"Never Enough\\" directed to the fans who just can't let this band be who they are without wanting more. <br /> <br />You can never be pleased with every song a band makes, but in the case of Octavarium it is layered with feeling, thought and direction. You can definately hear what influences them. U2, Pink Floyd, Muse and so on, but it is Dream Theater at their best. Panick Attack is unreal and very heavy. The opus Octavarium at 24 minutes is one of the best songs they've written. The thing that stands out is the attention to detail. Mike Portnoy's cymbal work on the drums is amazing. Jordan on keyboards comes up with some over the top sounds and James  vocally is at his best.  <br /> <br />This disk is more polished, less solos and variations that are more evident in other albums. It is more of a mix of all seven of their previous records. All in all one of their best. They will draw in a ton of new fans with this record.   <br />
078322737X|5.0|Yep! My pop was a baby boomer, so I grew up watching this film.  Even though I was born in '78, I treasure everything about this amazing movie. Line for line, song for song, nothing is better crafted. Wish I could have been there!!! I've see it hundrends of times and even wrote George Lucas about it's significance, back when I was a teen.  What did I get back??? An unsigned picture of him posing with none other than the heros of Star Wars!  (Not that that wasn't exceptional either.)
B000021YQV|5.0|this is the cd that made system of a down as big as they are. all the songs are pretty good, the lyrics are very weird and sometimes dont make much if any sense on some songs, but this is what ive come to expect from SOAD and thats what makes them different form every other rock band out there. the guitar playing and drumming are great. they go really well with Serj's singing. i guess ill do one of the song listings too: <br /> <br />1. prison song 10/10- great opener, heavy, political lyrics <br /> <br />2. needles 8/10- kind of a gross topic, makes you think <br /> <br />3. deer dance 8/10- good song but kind of repetitive of the first two songs <br /> <br />4. jet pilot 9/10- fast song,i used to hate it, but i like it a lot more now, lyrics are repetitive and dont make any sense, classic SOAD <br /> <br />5. X 8/10- almost like a part two of jet pilot, repetitive lyrics and fast <br /> <br />6. chop suey! 10/10- this is the first song i heard from these guys and its the one that got me hooked, calm at first, then gets faster and heavier, \\"angels deserve to die\\" <br /> <br />7. bounce 2/10- i know the wierd things that SOAD sings about but this is just stupid, a song about a pogo stick, a little like jet pilot but that song is better. <br /> <br />8. forest 7/10- good song, i get this and ATWA messed up a lot <br /> <br />9. ATWA 10/10- good lyrics on this one, one of my favorites on the cd <br /> <br />10. science 8/10- i get this song stuck in my head all the time, political lyrics... i think <br /> <br />11. toxicity 9/10- 2nd single i think, \\"spitting seeds as a pastime acitivity\\", i love the end of this song <br /> <br />12. shimmy 8/10- i love this song, its got the coolest riff in it and the lyrics are pretty sweet, too short though <br /> <br />13. psycho 7/10- a song about someone who does drugs, its grown on me a lot, they shouldve taken a minute off this and put it on shimmy though <br /> <br />14. ariels 7/10- last single off this cd, i dont get it atall but its still pretty good. its got some of their cultural music at the end which is pretty cool <br /> <br />top 5 favorites: chop suey!, prison song, ATWA, jet pilot, toxicity
0838577016|4.0|I am an undergraduate neuroscience major.  I chose Principles Of Neural Science on my own, because I wanted a higher-level text than the course required.  The textbook provides a good overview of the many different aspects of neuroscience, from synaptic transmission to perception to development.  It is easy-to-read, not dense like some textbooks.  I find it especially helpful to read a chapter of the text before attempting to dive into a research article. My only criticism is that it refers to material from other chapters as though it should already be learned, as though the  book is meant to be read in order and not used as a reference.  With 63 chapters, I am not sure this is appropriate.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend this text.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Many people predicted that with this album, Coldplay would become the biggest band in the world. While the album is still fairly musically strong,there are no particular songs with the exception of \\"Fix You\\" that seem especially striking like \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"God Put a Smile on Your Face\\" were. A majority of the album is comprised of synth, piano, drums, and electric guitar causing a good number of the songs to sound like mere continuations of each other rather than songs that can truly move listeners individually. The songs that seek to emotionally impact the listener sound like an above average ballad, but fall short when compared to the previous accomplishments of \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Green Eyes\\". <br />       While this new album does succeed in making many of these songs especially \\"Talk\\" into live-audience pleasers, it fails to recapture the essence of what made them so magical in the first place. The absolutely gorgeous songs of the previous two albums including \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Amsterdam\\", \\"Warning Sign\\", and \\"Yellow\\" are replaced by stadium designed songs. This new slate of songs sounds fairly appealing to the ear, but does not convey an intense feeling of emotion and thus, becomes forgettable. It is still a strong album especially to those who considered Coldplay to be too mellow and wanted them to toughen their sound . However, those who loved  Coldplay for their unbelievably melacholic and touching songs may want to look else where.  <br />Top Songs: Fix You, White Shadows, Swallowed in the Sea
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is one of my absolute favorite books.  I read it the summer after my grandmother died.  I did not cry at her funeral, nor did I feel particularly sad--old people die.  My friends noticed a smiley face on my calendar.  I told them it was an unhappy face that marked the day my g-mom died, because I thought I'd forget otherwise.  Their reaction to this shocked me; it was as though I killed her myself. <br /> <br />Then I read The Stranger.  Brilliant.  The opening lines resonated:  \\"Maman died today.  Or yesterday maybe, I don't know.\\"  Everyone seems to mark it as a disturbing book, but I cannot imagine a truer, more honest book.  I strongly recommend it to anyone who has ever felt betrayed by society's judgments.
B0006L16N8|5.0|after reading the few  poor reviews of this cd, people say i loved the band but this cd was such a let down. they are fakes, if you like chris martin and co. ull definitely be pleased with this production. \\"fix you\\" just one of the great songs on here and if you dont think its done with the passion of the other cds, you dont understand it. and its only 10$ so go buy it! you wont be dissapointed
B000002KIE|4.0|There is little i can add to what has already been said of this record.  It IS punk.  it is what created the image and the attitude of late seventies England.  it is still relevant today and is acquiring new generations of fans constantly.  i'm not even very big on punk music and i love listening to this record.   <br /> <br />Why are \\"punk\\" bands today so differnt?  they all claim to be modern sid vicious' and turn out as pussy wining immatations of Green Day.  Good Charlette punk?!  don't make me hurl.   <br /> <br />\\"never mind the bullocks\\" is an album that everyone should own.  it is the definaition of classic punk and a testiment to a once great genre of music!
B00097A5HW|5.0|I'm French, and even if the album will be released in France the next week, I am crazy of \\" La Tortura \\". <br /> <br />Someone, I don't remember who, was blaming Shakira about her spanish album. Don't you know that she is Columbian ? Don't you know that she had her first successes in South America and Spain ? Don't you know that she will release a second album called \\" Fixation Oral 2\\" with other songs but in english ? <br /> <br />So please, don't say if you don't know ! Stop thinking that english is the only language in the world ! Spanish is very beautiful. Italian too ( and French too ;) ). <br /> <br />Shakira is a world citizen. She speaks fluently english and has put French and Germand in two of her last songs. I can't wait to hear this !
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|i picked up \\"franz ferdinand\\" after \\"this fire\\" was a single.  it wasn't the kind of thing i usually listen to but i liked the singles i had heard.  from the second the bass and drums kick into the first track (which is about 40 seconds into it) i was hooked.  every song is as good or better than the one before it.   <br /> <br />my favourite songs are \\"jacquilen\\", \\"dark of the matinee\\", \\"take me out\\", \\"darts of pleasure\\" , \\"michael\\", and \\"40\\".  the other songs are all really good too.  but they lack a bit of soemthing. <br />in all this album is very nicely made.  if it was more my kind of music i probably would have given it 5 star.  i can't wait for this band's sophmore album ~ in its self the fact that a new band could create soemthing this fresh and entertaining gives us hope that pop music may finally be leaving this hip hop / crappy \\"punk\\" phase.  sure franz copied a lot of people.  but they did it very well.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is a pure masterpiece. My favourite track personally is fix you then speed of sound, what if and then swallowed in the sea. this is a must get album. 10/10
B000002I25|5.0|Mixing this band's obvious talent with Morrison's poetry and musky, depressing voice makes listening to The Doors' music an amazing trip. This album just strikes the surface of the mystery of Morrison and his hard-to-interpret lyrics. Meet The Doors through this album and you'll wonder how you ever lived without the music. A must have for any classic rock fan looking for a lyrical code to crack. This album gives me the chills; front to back. The Doors deserve all 5 stars and more.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I can  understand why some few people might be dissapointed with this album because a lot of the songs sound like any other coldplay song and their really isn't anything new to look forward to. But I really wish people would stop complaining about how chris's lyrics are just your typical little love song lyrics, but what do you expect? This is coldplay. Chris sings about love and little things in general and that's what I have grown to love about Coldplay. They've stayed consistent with all three albums and I'm glad they've done that instead of \\"trying something new\\" that some other bands do and just fail at it. I love each song in it's own way. Personal faves are \\"Talk\\", \\"Square One\\", \\"Fix You\\", and of course the amazing first single \\"Speed of Sound\\". It's a typical coldplay cd, your typical coldplay songs, but their different. That's all. I recommend this cd to any coldplay fans. If your dissapointed, than your dissapointed. Just depends on what your looking for.
B000002NFM|5.0|I would definatly suggest this cd to anyone. I got this cd and fell in love with it, and i'm having trouble trying to find any music now that I like as much as The Prodigy. All the tracks on this cd were perfectly made. And I listen to this cd all the time, it never gets old.
B00005JNEI|2.0|A lackluster \\"dumbed down\\" version of Alex Jones's key material on the subject, in my opinion. Mr. Jones even addresses this in his new movie. If you really want to learn the whole story, pick up an Alex Jones' movie.
0312995423|1.0|If this is the first Dan Brown book that you've ever picked up then I urge you to quickly put it back down.  It cannot compare to his later works - most notably The DaVinci Code.  I won't go into detail on the plot synopsis - it's in loads of other reviews. The plot was very unbelievable.  Stupid cryptographers and horrible character dialogue made me want to throw the book out the window.  This was Brown's first attempt at a novel so I can't fault him too much because he really has come a long way.  The book is definitely NOT worth purchasing unless you are at a garage sale and see it for a quarter or less.  I read it on vacation and regretted I wasted my time with it.  I regret more that I spent 6.99 in the airport for it.
B0000VCZKW|3.0|Who wrote the grossly deceptive product description for this DVD??  Matilda's dad??  Stupidly, I figured that \\"special edition\\" meant widescreen.  Instead, I get the DVD only to find that its an annoying full-screen version.  The movie itself gets 5 stars.  This full-screen version gets two.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Ihave had this album five days now and I have not grown sick of it.  It is full of both beautiful mid-tempo ballads and arena-shaking anthems, what more could you ask for?  One complaint I have is the lyrics can be a little vague and insipid, however the fantastic melodies and great musicianship overcome this.  A MESSAGE, FIX YOU and WHITE SHADOWS are superb.
B00006LIRI|3.0|A decent complilation, but if you want the REAL flavour of U2, it is infinitely better to buy their best CD Auchung Baby, or their best early CD, War... in both those cases they manage to move beyond their fairlyl mainstream pop-rock genre into some unique and wonderous places...<br />Cheers.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I am definitely with one of the reviewers below, in that I am usually more of a progressive metal listener, but these guys are just too much fun to pass up. I have been a fan of theirs for a while now, and listened to Waking the Fallen all this past year. While this album is indeed different in many ways, I still enjoyed it immensely. I for one have been listening to too much screaming metal stuff recently, so hearing a good album with clean vocals was actually a nice change. I have no problems with this \\"new\\" sound for A7x, they are still awesome, perhaps even moreso....and I can't wait to see them live next weekend on the Warped Tour!!! Buy this album if you are in the mood for some sexy guitar solos.   MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Franz Ferdinand is probably the best alternative album to come out in 2004. This Scotish rockers play excellent lively, fast paced rock. I wasn't paying much attention to the lyrics so far, because, I admit they just didn't seem important with such great tunes. I especially like their guitar riffs. I just think that they're amazing. But when I finally checked out the lyrics I found out that they're not bad at all. They're just great in some songs. But you just have to listen to them carefully. I first heard Michael, which I really liked and I also liked This Fire which I heard next. I somehow missed their biggest hit Take Me Out, but when I finnaly heard it, after I got the cd, I just loved it at once.<br /><br />Tell Her Tonight has just an amazing tune, especially at the beginning and in the chours. It's a song about a girl, and how he's ''...Gonna have to tell her tonight...''<br /><br />Their biggest hit so far, Take Me Out, is also my favourite song on this cd. This song probably has one of the best tunes in the chours that I heard for a long time. ''I say don't you know, you say you don't know, I say take me out...'' Such a great song.<br /><br />This Fire starts a bit slow but then turns in a really great, fast paced song, whit lyrics about burning the city. Well, the lyrics are really not important, because you're just gonna love the song anyway.<br /><br />The first song I heard, Michael, starts with great guitar playing and then adding some drums. Really cool beginning of the song. Also I think that the  chourse are really great, with great singing, although the lyrics may be a bit weird,  about dancing with Michael.<br /><br />So that'a all about Franz Ferdinand's debut album. I just hope that another one is coming soon, because I just can't get enough of that kind of music. So, go and get this album if you don't have it already.
B000063CMK|5.0|<br />\\"We will always be so much more human than we wish to be....\\" <br /> <br />Pain of Salvation.  <br /> <br />This band is my favorite ever.  <br /> <br />I'm sorry to resort to hyperbole, but no band has ever had such a powerful emotional draw for me, and Remedy Lane is a perfect example of these powerful emotions that PoS evokes so wonderfully. While I do feel that The Perfect Element pt. I is their best album as a whole, I think many of the individual songs on Remedy Lane stand out strongly. I NEVER tire of listening to this album, and even the songs that initially sounded strange because of the polyrythms sound \\"just right\\" to me now.  <br /> <br />It certainly helps that Daniel Gildenlow is also one of my favorite vocalists ever. Many people say he is over the top or something, but that's how I like my singers to be: theatrical, dramatic, evocative, versatile...there are so many times where his voice both lifts me uup and drowns me in intense pain. That moment in \\"Trace of Blood\\" where he mournfully wails, \\"too late we learned!\\" just breaks my heart every time. And there is of course the amazing \\"Undertow\\" that just builds and builds, and Fandango is one of the strangest but most interesting songs, and \\"Beyond the Pale\\" still gives me chills... \\"its just another small thorn in my crown/ Then suddenly one day there was too much blood in my eyes/ and I had to take this walk down Remedy Lane of whys and whys..... <br /> <br />Pain of Salvation.  <br /> <br />Watch them dance down the Remedy Lane and let the Undertow sweep you away....
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is a must have for any casual or die-hard Coldplay fan.  The music is unlike anything out there right now.  They have distinguished themselves as an \\"original\\" rock band.  I have listened to the X&Y album non-stop, and it still gives me huge goosebumps.  Chris Martin and the whole gang have proven again that they are musical geniuses.  I think that with the next couple of albums, if not this newest one, they will surpass U2.  Yes, the music is just that good, for young and old.  Their lyrics are deep and intelligent.  They make you stop and think.  Also, let me tell you...riffs and crescendos in todays music are very scarce...this album delivers that and more.  When a song starts out soft and low, then ends in a huge volume of music with a great melodie, (which by the way, is also missing from todays music) is just pure genius.  \\"Square One\\", \\"What If\\", \\"Fix You\\", and \\"Talk\\" all have potential of being singles.  \\"Talk\\" which is probably my personal favorite flows very very nicely throughout the whole song.  \\"Fix You\\" is one of those songs that have the very quiet beginning and end on a nice loud note.  \\"'Til Kingdom Come\\" the album's bonus track is a great ending to a masterpiece.  Coldplay has done it again.  I'll put this album up against any album that has been released in the last 10 years.  NOTE:  when you can hum a song's melodie after listening to it for the first time...its a proven success.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is growing on me more than their previous two. Definitely pick a copy of this up.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Audioslave surely takes parts of its perfromance from its lineage, even in the first album you could hear the vocals that were so SoundGarden and riffs that were soo RATM. I would surely say the first album was a good one ( I still kick my self in the ass for having free passes to a live show in Dallas and not going cause I didnt know abt the band). The second album carries on where the first one left off, the second one still carries on the same flavor, and its the best of what Rock has to offer in the present times where music is ruled by hip-Hop and Rap.. <br /> <br />surely a good effort by these guys.
B000002H33|5.0|Every time a metal band comes out with a very big album, critics call it their \\"Master of Puppets\\" Why? Because Master of Puppets is one of the best albums metal has given. Track after track, Metallica proves that they are not to be messed with. From the opening acoustic riffs of Battery, to the punishing finish of Damage Inc, this album refuses to let you go. Now a days, if a band released a new album with only 8 songs on it, fans would be pissed. This 8 track effort however, at times sounds like a double-disc release. \\"Battery\\" thrashes you around like a tornado, \\"Master of Puppets\\" provides one of the best riffs in history, and \\"Disposable Heros\\" gives a fast and tear-up song about war. Then there's \\"Sanitarium,\\" a can't miss haunter with echoing verses and a thrashing finish. There are no mistakes on this album, absolutely none, and the fact that it hit #22 on the Billboard charts without any radio or TV play shows that. Metallica was, is, and always will be an authority in metal. Black Sabbath started metal, but Metallica saved it from that spandex, LA crap. This album marked the beginning of Metallica's takeover of the world.
B00006JLX4|2.0|OK, maybe I'm just an ignorant Irish man but WHAT is the deal with the hype and crazy praise for Pavement!? SPECIFICALLY this album. I read the reviews, heard a song or two and bought \\"Slanted...\\" expecting to be blown away. I wasn't! 'No biggie', I thought to myself, '...everyone says its a grower. I'll just have a few more listens and I'll be in on the buzz'. Then came the last time I FORCED myself so sit through \\"Slanted...\\" from start to finish, 3 days ago, and I just said, 'THATS IT!'(out loud, to myself)! This album is boring. Really boring. It's even a little noisy and harsh at times. Sure there's some nice guitar on there, but the singer just kills it for me. He sounds like the least interested lead vocalist to ever join a band. He delivers every line like its on his suicide note. After 3 or 4 songs it sounds like a mundane \\"blah blah blah...\\". Im a big Pixies, Faith No More and Fugazi fan. Music for me has got to have a kick, some umpf, some HEART!! This vocalist doesnt, this album has little and if you have similar tastes to myself, DONT believe the hype!
B0006L16N8|3.0|I'm a great fan of Rush and Parachutes, but aside from a few rousing cuts this recording reveals a band that's tired and uninspired...
0060245867|5.0|I got this when my oldest was nearly 3 years old.  He absolutely loved the book and wanted to read it several times a week.  It is great, down to the detail of the mouse needing a napkin after his cookie.  I asked my son why and he pointed to the crumbs.  Such wonderful detail.  We are continually finding new details in the pictures and that makes it fun, even after reading it for the millionth time. <br /> <br />We got to reading it so much that I decided to see if he could guess what happens on the next page and he was right about 75% of the time.  Now we pull this one out and he \\"reads\\" to me.  He doesn't know how to read yet, but he still remembers the story and figures out what is going on by looking at the pictures.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|They took a gamble on changing their style, making more epic songs, and playing more technical music. This cd flat out dominates.
B0009OPO0S|3.0|I'm a long-time Shakira fan, and I like many others have been anxiously awaiting this album for the last four years! I would have to say without a doubt that \\"Dnde Estn Los Ladrones?\\" remains my favorite Shakira album, though. <br /> <br />After Laundry Service, I was very excited to see where Shakira would go next. It was a great crossover album with something to offer both fans of her Latin music and new fans. When I first popped in \\"Fijacin Oral Volumen I,\\" I must say my first thought, like another reviewer I read, was that \\"En Tus Pupilas\\" was not a good opening song...that's not to say it's not a good song, I think it's pretty and I love the French mixed in there...it just didn't get me as interested in the album as another faster song might have. <br /> <br />I think also, like someone said, that \\"La Tortura\\" sounds a bit odd on this album. It has a great beat and all, it just didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the album's feel. Oh well. It's a fun 'top 10' kind of song. <br /> <br />One of my favorite songs has to be \\"Da de Enero,\\" because it's so happygolucky! :) It was really a breath of fresh air, and just what I needed to hear at the time. She's so positive in this song, it's a great one to lift your spirits. <br /> <br />I liked the very dark feeling that the first parts of \\"Lo Imprescindible\\" gave, it sounded almost creepy...but then as the bridge/hook starts, it lightens up a bit. A very good song in that it carries a lot of moods in one package. <br /> <br />So about the album in general, I must admit that I am disappointed. I don't think it's a complete failure, not by a long shot! I just feel that perhaps with all that time away writing songs perhaps there could have been some improvements made or other songs selected for the album. Though I will continue enjoying this album, I think that it's not quite what I was hoping, but at least it's something! And I will still be looking forward to \\"Oral Fixation Volume II\\" coming out soon! :)
B0006L16N8|5.0|Don't compare this album to other Coldplay releases; the other albums don't compare. A Rush of Blood was a beautiful album, but -despite my initial distaste of }X & Y{- this album is just as good as A Rush of Blood to the Head(maybe better). \\"Fix You\\" is my all-time favorite Coldplay song (yes it's better than \\"Yellow\\" or \\"Spies\\" or \\"The Scientist\\" or \\"In My Place\\" or \\"Clocks\\"). My advice is to buy the album and give it more than one listen. Each time you listen the album will grow on you. This one's gonna be huge!

0007144369|5.0|The Collins edition of Oscar Wilde's complete works is the only one I've ever found that actually is *complete*. It contains not only all of his plays, fairy tales, and short stories, but also most of his essays (some brilliant writing) and *all* his poems. Many books say they do, but there are a few tiny gems that oft go unnoticed (such as \\"Love Song\\" and a lovely little piece with no name). A truly wonderful edition of a truly wonderful writer, or, as Wilde himself might say, \\"Quite utterly lovely.\\" Also, if I am not mistaken, contains several pages of pictures of Wilde and his family.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay will no doubt in my mind be one of the few bands along with a few singer/songwriters from this era to be remembered 20-30 years from now. A few of them noted: Audioslave, Tool, White Stripes, Jack Johnson, Damien Rice, Ben Harper, and maybe a couple here or there that I didnt mention. But all the other bands you can just throw them all into a pile and watch them fade away, because they don't bring anything new to the table or take something old and bring it to new heights. Coldplay writes these psychadelic melodies that leave the listenter in a emotional trance. Chris Martin writes beautiful/smart lyrics as well, giving the songs a very interlectual feel. As if the songs are more composed rather than just rocked out. Now don't get me wrong rocking out is deffennitely not a bad thing, I myself enjoy loud guitar riffs and solo's, but Coldplay are doing something different. You won't see any mosh pits at their live performances, but you will deffintely have felt like you just experienced something special.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I remember the first time I listened to I&W and Awake.  I was blown away.  I can listen to both of those CDs at any time and still enjoy them. <br /> <br />From then on, I haven't been moved.  I'd like to blame the change on the loss of Kevin Moore's lyrical contribution (which they surely miss) and the inclusion of Portnoy as a lyricist (he's absolutely brutal) but I'm sure that's just part of the problem.  I will say that I enjoy FII and Six Degrees - it took me until this year (yes, this year) to appreciate Six Degrees.  The others I can live without. <br /> <br />I've enjoyed my first few listens and I'm sure most fans will, too.  This is certainly better than ToT, which was a total mess.  I think if I stop hoping for a I&W and Awake-type release and give up on lyrical masterpieces as in previous releases (pre SFAM), I'd enjoy DT that much more.   <br /> <br />Solid, solid effort - though \\"safe\\" in a few areas.  Good, not nearly their best, though.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This new cd is classic Coldplay with a new twist.  It's the same soulful music, but with a more electronic undercurrent.  It's as good as their previous cds, which makes it EXCELLENT!  If you haven't bought a Coldplay cd, you're really missing out.  They are originals and a breath of fresh air in this era of cookie cutter, prepackaged musical acts.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|this is by far avenged's best album yet. people are complaining and moaning about how Shadows rarely screams in this entire album. This is true. however, if you are in any sense, musically oriented, then you will clearly see how this album is far superior to their earlier work. The harmonies of the guitars is really Iron Maiden-like, along with some sweet double bass and drum fills, make for an awesome metal cd.
B000001DTM|5.0|U2's \\"Achtung Baby\\" is their crowning achievement, even better than the real thing, i mean the Joshua Tree. It is filled with epic songs and the best lyrics Bono ever produced. I dunno what happened in the early 90s in Berlin when they made this album, but something magical overtook U2 and it produced one of the greatest rock albums ever. <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is something that cannot be properly explained...if you are the kind of person who loves getting a tingle in your spine from that perfect melody, or loves hearing something completely rabid, transforming, chance taking... you won't be dissapointed with this new discovery - the tightest instrumentation, the best songwriting;  musical and lyric. Funky, fast, smooth, trancy and mind-absorbing, this album can and will blow the voyager's mind away, only to give it back to him so that he may take another listen - on a dark night, during a rainy day, or in an underground latin theatre covered in red lights. oh, and read the lyrics - Yeah, my icepick is \\"coming\\" on the marble shrine...from my having listened to this musical treasure.
B0006L16N8|3.0|For me the best song in this collection is the hidden track Kingdom Come.  It is a true surprise in it's honesty, simplicity, and sheer beauty.  Perfect lemonade after a 12-song diet of sugary syrup.  And too, it is a surprise as it is delivered in the manner of an after thought given it's position.  The rest of the collection is clearly a worried-over effort that tries to best its predecessor.  Sadly it doesn't.   <br /> <br />Here's how to fix the problem. <br /> <br />Dummer.  Simple highhat, kickdrum and snare.  No more complex tom rythyms or chugga-chugga 16th notes.  Play with your heart not your head. <br /> <br />Guitarist. We like your style but you need to expand.  Lead us down a path that seems obvious but then surprise us with things that touch the soul. <br /> <br />Singer.  Remember Politik, and A Rush of Blood to the Head?  Don't sing to mortals, sing to gods.  Less broken spirit stuff, we're not all broken hearted or lost or sad. <br /> <br />Basist.  You're fine. <br /> <br />Please don't become the Styx of this century.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I'm so moved by the aural space inside my headphones that I've nearly forgotton how to type. X & Y is something else...something great that should not be overlooked by anybody with a real musical taste. Sonically different from anything they've done before, and in terms of composition, melody, harmony, emotion, it continues where Parachutes left off, though somewhere in the far future... Subjective point: Square One is so beautiful I felt tear-eyed. Everything that follows is like a real rush of blood to the head. Speaking of which, this whole review is coming from a man who loved the first album, but thought Rush of Blood To The Head fell short of great; it was very emotionally simplistic with an air of adult-contemporary. But this third effort has shown the band's true nature, and their ability to truly soar - above the same old heard-it-befores and the Hollywood reporters, above buildings and into the sky: into the X & Y.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Is it just me or is the breakdown at 2min30sec into \\"Revenga\\" one of the most incredible things ever? Okay, so I got the album a week late, someone punch me in the face for not getting it sooner. I love it, but then again, I love these guys in general. As political as they are, they're just so much fun. They just simply rock it so hard and there's no other band to compare. Man, they're supposed to go on tour with The Mars Volta this summer. Can you imagine that? How orgasmic would that be? This album is incredible. Buy it if you can handle it, but then again, I don't think you'd be reading this review if you didn't already agree. Enjoy!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|THE MACHINIST is a mesmerizing film, a journey through the interstices of a mind deprived of sleep, of nourishment, and a mind that struggles to untangle the chaos of a past of guilt and terror. And the journey is terrifying.<br /><br />When the film opens we meet Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) or at least the emaciated, tortured remains of a man who hasn't slept for a year.  We don't know why this worker in a machine factory is in such condition: the story unwinds slowly so that by the end we accompany Reznik in his shock to his moment of discovery.  It is the getting there that is the tough beauty of this amazingly rich film as written by Scott Kosar and directed by Brad Anderson.<br /><br />The setting is always dark as though the state of mind is a nightmare.  Reznik's meager existence is challenged when he is involved in an industrial accident in which a fellow worker Miller (Michael Ironside) loses an arm.  Shocked by the accident (for which Reznik feels responsible) the various few people in his life seem supportive: a hooker named Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a waitress in an airport all night diner Marie (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n), and an ambiguous bald man Ivan (John Sharian) who appears to Reznik in strange ways.<br /><br />Reznik's mind slowly disintegrates into paranoid delusions, the only way he can hold his life together is by post-its reminding him first of his documented progressive weight loss, then of his needs, then of his secret mystery.  To say more would be a great disservice to the extraordinary plot.<br /><br />Christian Bale delivers one of the most committed performances on film.  He not only physically inhabits Reznik with his skeletal appearance, he also mentally nurtures all the nuances of fear, pain, pleasure and madness that build as his character's reason for a year of insomnia is revealed at the very end.  We stand in suspense with him and his fall is as powerful as any Dante ever devised.  The entire cast is superb but special kudos go to Jennifer Jason Leigh who finally has a role that allows her to demonstrate the spectrum of skill she possesses as an actress.  Not an easy film, this, but a very important one.  Highly recommended - but not to see alone!  Grady Harp, June 05al kudos go to Jennifer Jason Leigh who finally has a role that allows her to demonstrate the spectrum of skill she possesses as an actress.

B0006L16N8|4.0|Capitol Records is right to use Coldplay as the reason their stock rises or falls.  With the release of X&Y, Coldplay has really taken their place as one of the more influential bands of our time.  The reviews here have been mixed, but those one-star reviews really should be ignored on the release date.  No one can give a fair review after one listen.  I've been listening to this album all day....start to finish and over again. <br /> <br />This is by far Coldplay's breakthrough album.  Yes, even more so than A Rush of Blood to the Head.  I really don't understand all the comparisons to U2.  Yes, Martin's voice sounds a bit like Bono's, but the musical style is completely different.  X&Y is unmistakably Coldplay.  The same vocal style, the same lullaby crooning, and the same ethereal crecendos.  Only this time, they've added a synth here and there.  The synths, however, don't overpower the live instrumentation.  It's used merely as a support element.  The result is that the music sounds more lush and has much more depth than in the first two records.   <br /> <br />The first half of the album is so sonically uplifting it gives me chills.  \\"Square One\\" and \\"Fix You\\" are almost reminiscent of Pink Floyd in their use of layered guitars (wow, the guitars on this album!) and layered vocals.  The song \\"What If\\" is almost reminiscent of Sigur Ros in its ending swell.  The very upbeat songs, \\"White Shadows\\" and \\"Talk\\" are also magical in their own right.  The second half of the album starts out strongly with \\"Speed of Sound\\".  This track is the only one that's of the same style as the first two albums.  It's almost a perfect blend of \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Moses\\" (from the Live 2003 set).  The album takes a less exciting turn after this song that begins to recover with \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" and finishes strong with the amazing \\"Twisted Logic\\".  Then, after it seems to end perfectly with this track (and 30 seconds of silence), the hidden track \\"Til Kingdom Comes\\" arrives like an encore.  While not at all like the other tracks on this album (rumor has it that it was written for Johnny Cash), this is still a pretty cool little song.   <br /> <br />All the rumors about Chris Martin's marriage to Gwyneth and his new fatherhood status ruining this album are completely unfounded.  Yes, a song or two is probably about Gwyneth, but it's not gushy, rather it's done quite tastefully.  This is an incredible album by Coldplay.  Sadly, I think people's expectations were so high that no matter how good it is, it won't be as universally loved as A Rush of Blood to the Head.  Too bad, this is truly the defining Coldplay album.
0553573403|5.0|Grim, brutal, intriguing, compelling, large of scope, exciting, and extremely addictive.  I'm very very impressed with Martin's writing.  He brings a fair amount of depth and realism to his characters that is often times lacking in this genre.  The complex royal intrigue in Game of Thrones is reminiscent of the original Dune series.  I can't recommend this book enough.  An excellent read.
B00097A5HW|1.0|Not her best album. Some of the songs are complete rip offs. She is supposed to be an \\"original\\" artist yet she jumps on the bandwagon with La Tortura copying Reggaeton just like Jlo. On encondite Ingles she sounds like Gwen Stefani when she was in No doubt.  <br /> <br />Im bringing back my copy tomorrow and I advise the rest of you not to bother with the album. Some of the songs are just aweful, it was hard to even get through the album. Its definitally not a rock album and while trying to appeal to everyone the whole album together doesnt really appeal to anybody. Think twice about buying this album!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I gotta be honest, the first time I heard this album, I didn't like it. I'm 20 years old and I've been a fan of DT for about 5 years, and I've always gravitated towards their heavier tunes (i.e. Pull me Under, Glass Prison, Lie, and anything off of T.O.T). But I'm also a musician and therefore am very into the virtuosic side of DT. I recently purchased Jordan Rudess' latest album and got even more into his style of playing. Although he does tend to overshadow Petrucci some times, I think his playing has once again succeeded my expectations. I think this album takes a bit of getting used to. There's definitely some more \\"pop-style\\" songs on here, but it's also very progressive. I kept getting reminded of Yes, Kansas, and Genesis while listening to some of the non-metal tracks. It's probably a Dream Theater Fan crime to say this, but Train of Thought is still my favorite DT album. It's fast, it's heavy, and it shreds non stop (except for the cello-driven \\"Stream Of Consciousness\\"). But the nice thing about \\"Octavarium\\" is that this album is almost a direct contrast from T.O.T. But lets not forget the heaviness of Panic Attack; John Myung's bass chops are still among the best. Granted, Petrucci isn't as solo crazy as he was on the last album, but this just goes to show his versatility. He can be the monster lead guitarist everyone loves, but he can also be the support structure of the band that is so well needed. The more I listen to this album the more I like it, and I think that's going to be the case for a lot of listeners. Dream Theater albums have always been in heavy rotation in my CD player, and this latest album by the DT boys will contribute to my daily dose of virtuosity and general musical genius. Well done gentlemen..
B0006L16N8|2.0|First of all, let me say that I am a big coldplay fan. I own both of their albums and will be seeing them in concert this summer. Rush of blood is one of my favorite albums ever. <br /> <br />But, for me X&Y is a disappointment and not up to the standard of the first two albums. All of the songs have a grander, more epic feel to them, but they are hollow at their core. The melodies, rhythms, lyrics, etc. - simply are not interesting or catchy. I'm not even sure I would call them B-Side material, because most of coldplay's B-Sides are better than what is on this album. In fact if you are disappointed by X&Y and have not yet heard any of their B-Sides, I would highly recommend checking out the following songs: <br /> <br />Moses <br />Brothers & Sisters <br />Only Superstition <br />One I Love <br />I Ran Away <br />Talk (early leaked version) <br />Crest of Waves <br />Ladder to the Sun <br />Murder <br />Animals <br /> <br />That being said, I gave it two stars rather than one because there are still a couple tracks on X&Y that I find agreeable, including square one, the hardest part, and swallowed in the sea.  <br /> <br />This will not be an undisputed classic like OK Computer or The Joshua Tree. I believe coldplay are capable of producing such an album, but we will have to wait until next time to find out.
B00000K3D4|2.0|When I watched this movie, I had an image of some very dry execs sitting down in a room and thinking, \\"OK, let's try to figure this out: how does a kid think? what do they like?\\" Needless to say, they failed miserably.  It's not 'charming', or entertaining, or even funny. David Bowie is not at all a compelling villain, and the plot jumps so much from one situation to the next, that it doesn't really develop from its basic premise of a girl trying to rescue her brother. Sure, she grows up over the course of the movie. But you don't really feel that until the end; most of the movie feels like a summarizing list of events--first, event A happened, and then character X got hit on the head, then event B happened, and the characters were transferred to setting Y, etc. etc. It was just not emotionally moving. The creatures are pretty cool, and the ball scene when Jennifer Connely's character is imprisoned inside her dream is very nice, but overall this movie is disappointing. And much of the time, it felt as though the actors did not believe in the world they were portraying, which is the knell of death for any story.
B00097A5HW|1.0|i dont understand why you ppl can buy something you cant even understand its like she didnt even thank of us of cant speak nothing but englash how selfish is that i thank its much selfifsh on her part i for one is no longer a fan of hers since she has done this to the us and that gose for anyone singer who will do this kind of thing i will longer be a fan of them eather i give this cd a big 0 come we atre the us not overseas we wont something we can understand
B0006L16N8|5.0|At first listen, my ears didn't caught the attention of the songs (unlike A RUSH OF BLOOD...). But on the 2nd listen and the 3rd... Oh! I just couldn't get it off my head. Especially the two of their most melancholic penned compositions for this album (What If & Fix You). \\"What If\\" hits you (like The Scientist) whenever you feel regretful of past experiences (What a Radiohead-Pink Floydish influenced short ending). \\"Fix You\\" just makes you feel that hope is always there (What a majestic but simple ending). \\"Square One\\" is their most progressive composition to date. It's kinda like \\"U2\\", \\"Radiohead\\" and a little bit of \\"Yes\\" combined into one (Why \\"Yes\\"? Listen to the ending where they progressed from a full-rock sound to suddenly acoustic. BUT This is my opinion only, okay?). \\"A Message\\" is quite similar to \\"Fix You\\" only milder (U2 influence on the climax especially the guitars). \\"White Shadows\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"Low\\" and \\"Speed Of Sound\\" are like soft new wave revival tracks with Speed of Sound being sounding like an Echo & the Bunnymen track (Well \\"Daylight\\" & \\"A Whisper\\" have the same features on their last album and Ian McCulloh was indeed given credit isn't it?). \\"The Hardest Part\\" is sort of 10,000 Maniac-influenced. \\"X&Y\\" is like (you won't believe this!) a melancholic \\"I AM THE WALRUS/STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER track (by the Beatles! funny ah? But again, this is my opinion). \\"Swallowed By The Sea\\" & \\"Twisted Logic\\" are like a mixture of modern rock and classic rock ala Beatles' style of music [listen to the short guitar riff (at 0:36sec - 0:54sec & again at 2:56 - 3:14) of Twisted Logic which sounds like \\"She's so heavy\\" or \\"The Animals' House Of The Rising Run\\"]. \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" is definitely classic Johnny Cash. Well, that's the real purpose of it. It's an ode to the late great Johnny Cash. <br /> <br />     The cover art...Beautiful. Simple yet, I believe, it will stand the test of time. It's like an 80's new wave art influenced cover that would make people become really interested and curious as to what's inside the packaging. <br /> <br />     So is Coldplay's \\"X&Y\\" \\"A Leap Forward\\"? Well, only a bit. But honestly, I love their melancholy format. And this is definitely one of the best releases of 2005 (if not, the best). I will not be surprised if this album receives a handful of grammy's and european awards. And our country was blessed enough to have the album available as early as June 3rd, 2005.
B0007XT7V8|4.0|Love this stuff. But this review is for track 10 - \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" . Way to go Guys!!! You hit it right with this one. <br />If TOADM decides to do an acoustic album - it will be good. I look forward to it. Several of the songs on Gasoline are pretty good - But \\" Since You've Been Gone\\" - Is Excellent.
B000929AJQ|4.0|A few reviewers I see have shown their inorgance, have rushed to a decision about this CD. If you have really being paying attention to what Trent has been through the last few years, you would expect nothing else. It IS different than The Fragile, and a little more accessible than the past, and I DO think The Fragile is a masterpiece (even though Trent himself feels otherwise), but this 2005 NIN is brilliant all the same. Been 5 -6 years since The Fragile, are YOU the same as you were 5 years ago!? I can name several albums in my 40 years that I first heard and hated and now love. (This in not one however, liked it from day one.) Patience..... Just saw him in San Diego 0n 5/31/05, his talent and emotion are undeniable. Congrats on your case victory also Trent! Highly recommend the DVD DualDisc surround sound version of this also, amazingly cool!
B00078XGRO|5.0|\\"Star Trek: First Contact\\" is the best of the films that feature the cast of \\"The Next Generation.\\" It features all the classic \\"Trek\\" elements, while injecting horror, humor, and a bit of \\"Trek\\" history into the mix. Clever writing, superb acting, and spectacular visual effects and action make this one a \\"Star Trek\\" film not to be missed.<br /><br />And now, the film has received the ultimate treatment with the \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" DVD! The featurettes are great, and the two commentary tracks (The first by Actor/Director Jonathan Frakes, and the second by screenwriters Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga) are both informative and very funny. Fans of the film, or of \\"Star Trek\\" for that matter, will not want to miss assimilating this one into their DVD Collections.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+
B00005JKES|5.0|The PILOT episode has never been included with Season 1 -- not on DVD or VHS. I has always been separate. I think its because it is longer. The PILOT episode should NOT be confused with EPISODE 1 -- as they are two very different episodes. A real Twin Peaks fan would know this, and would'nt be upset by this mistake & you shouldnt be upset, either. Therefore, it is not Amazon.com's fault that you made this mistake. However, just because the SEASON 1 BOXED SET doesnt have the PILOT doesnt mean it isnt well worth owning. I wish I owned it.
B000009ED0|1.0|For those who can listen to Kid Rock's incessant screaming, unenlightened lyrics (\\"...and the chicks with beepers\\" ???), and derivative music and say that this is entertaining, doesn't have a musical bone or one iota of creativity in their body.  Everytime one of his songs comes on the radio, I want to find the nearest bridge to jump off of.  Then I remember that I can change the station, and abruptly do. <br /> <br />Listen, do yourself a favor: Don't buy this crap.  The more you buy Kid Rock, Britany Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Gwen Stefani, the more the \\"music\\" industry is going to cram down our throats.  So, do me a favor: Take all your CDs of the Backstreet Boys, NSuck, Kid Rock, Limp Noodle...i mean Bizkit, and burn them.  It'll be bad for the environment, but oh so good for my ears. <br /> <br />If you want true ear candy, try some Dream Theater, King's X, or even some Disturbed (one of the few Nu Metal acts actually deserving of their praise).  You can't go wrong with Metallica, Audioslave, or Velvet Revolver either.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is amazing and must for any lover of music. <br />The songs are brilliant and moving. Every song is full and complete and leaves you with a sense of satisfaction.  \\"Fix You\\" will stay in your head for days and days. <br />It really is beautifully written and recorded. <br />As Coldplay's 3rd album I feel it more than equals the genius of the first two. <br />You WILL be very happy with this album.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Absolutely wonderful! If you are a music fan like me you need to listen to Celtic Woman. I grew up playing rock drums and listening to Led Zeppelin. Today, my music tastes range from Beck to the Dixie Chicks. But this Celtic Woman album is tops!!! My favorite song is Meav's \\"SI Do Mhaimeo I\\"  I fell in love immediately!!! Listen to it for the first time before you go to bed at night. You will sleep like a baby!!!
B0007OCG56|4.0|As a poor white guy who can sometimes cook and has dated women from many cultures, I can relate a bit to \\"John,\\" Sandler's character.  Still, as others have indicated, the man is far too saintly to be realistic.  Any other guy would have blown his top at his wife's hysterics.<br /><br />Two of the biggest criticisms of \\"Spanglish,\\" besides Sandler's character being too nice, is that Brooks, the director, is sexist for depicting an accomplished white woman, played by Leoni, as completely hysterical and racist because of how he handles the issue of Hispanic culture and American ideals.<br /><br />I've known a few ultra-rich liberal white families.  \\"Deborah,\\" Leoni's character is, unfortunately, not that unrealistic.  I have personally witnessed a liberal white woman mistreat a Hispanic employee.  And I've known more than one woman who could compete with Deborah's selfishness.  I have also seen the mellow rich white guy who's clueless to his wife's rude behavior towards the Hispanic help.  The only mistake Brooks made, in my experience, was in making Leoni's character too much of a caricature.<br /><br />The issue of racism is a bit more complicated.  It should be obvious why Flor would want to keep her cultural identity and why should would want to pass this on to her daughter.  But would she deny her the chance of a lifetime to receive a top education?  It's a hard path to follow.  It seems like Brooks had the right intention (honoring cultural independence), he just couldn't figure out a way to show it in a way that was appropriate.<br /><br />*spoiler alert*<br /><br />Unlike viewers who applaud the \\"family values\\" ending, I can't say I enjoyed the last five minutes.  Staying married for the sake of being married is just stupid.  It's so obvious that Flor and John belong together and that Deborah should be dumped in a heartbeat.  Deborah is, quite bluntly, not just a lousy wife but also a horrible parent.  All of the kids would be better off with Flor and John together.<br /><br />I applaud Brooks for his bravery in depicting (finally!) a father figure who is loving, supportive and, most importantly, non-traditional (egalitarian).  Funny how some liberal critics missed that point.  Flor and John are the ideal parents while Deborah, the clueless perfectionist, represents any bad parent, male or female.
B0009F2C34|5.0|This album already has it's place in the annals of electronic music. DJ Shadow knows his stuff, and it showed IMMEDIATLEY with the original release of this debut album. <br /> <br />With the deluxe addition, there's a new disc of remixes and B-sides and demos. For any real Shadow fans, it's a must have. There's a fine remix of Bulding Steam With A Grain Of Salt, the song many consider to be the best from Endtroducing. There's also a great Gift of Gab remix of Midnight In A Perfect World, with some nice lyric poetry. And at the end of the disc is a twelve minute mini set of Shadow live, which is hot as hell. <br /> <br />If you've never heard of the Shadow, do yourself a favor and pick up this deluxe edition - it's oh so worth it. <br /> <br />Producing. . .
0778321606|4.0|I gave this book four stars because I am excited about the new characters and the new beginning of a series for Ms Macomber. <br />The style of writing was a little different but once I got used to it I thought it very nice.  This is a story that shows there is hope in all of us even if just a tiny spec. Angels where we least expect them and that love is close at hand if we are open to it and take a look.  I especially liked the part of the youth minister.  They play an important part in the life of the community and fall in love too!  A good book once again from Debbie Macomber.
B00006JDS4|5.0|This is one of the best movies in this world. I look the movie every 3 months on rainy weekends. Until today no movie has the same quality like this. Watch the movie and make up your mind.  <br />OK this is not everybodies taste but we are living in a free world.
B0006L16N8|5.0|The album is good, but not excellent. This album is worse then the previous two. However, all song are consistently good. \\"Speed of Sound\\" is the best song on the album. I was not swept of my feet with this album, but I do believe it deserves 5 stars. In conclusion, this album is worth buying.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|The 2004 movie, \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\", directed and written by Kerry Conran, includes the stellar cast of Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Michael Gambon and even the late Sir Laurence Olivier.  However, the movie, along with its exceptional cast and unique look, still falls victim to a questionable plot and mediocre acting.    It's the late 1930s and someone has been kidnapping some of the most brilliant scientists of the day.  While newspaper reporter Polly Perkins (Paltrow) is tracking down leads to the disappearances, New York is attacked by a group of giant robots bent on stealing power supplies.  Enter Joe Sullivan a.k.a. the Sky Captain (Law) who is the leader of a squadron of flying aces based in a secretive location and Polly's former love interest.    When the base is destroyed and Joe's friend and technical wiz, Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi), is kidnapped, it's up to the Sky Captain and Polly to find out how the disappearance of the scientists connects to the robot attack, who's behind the chaos and what their plans are.  Clues soon lead the pair to Dr. Totenkopf (Olivier).  With the help of Captain Franky Cook (Jolie) and her amphibious squadron, they are able to infiltrate Totenkopf's lair and discover his dastardly plans.  From there, it's up to the Sky Captain to not only save the scientists but keep the entire world from being annihilated.    There are several good things about \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\".  With the increasing advances in technology, the movie is unique in the fact that the entire film was created by using strategically placed props with a green screen backdrop.  Except for the actors, most of the scenes in the movie were created by computers which gave the film a different look not seen in other features.    Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law are considered the two main characters of the film.  However, it's Giovanni Ribisi's performance as Dex Dearborn that really steals the movie and offers somecomedic relief.    Despite some good points, there are some negative aspects to the film.  Although their performances were fine, the fact that Paltrow's and Law's characters were formerly and potentially romantically involved didn't come across as such.  Unfortunately the use of Michael Gambon as Polly's editor and Angelina Jolie was to move the plot quickly from one place to another.  When using this talented actor and actress, it would seem that their characters could have been built up a little more.    The movie's ending was also anticlimactic.  It's easy to see how some people could walk away feeling completely confused.  At some parts towards the end, such as the battle inside the ship, it even seems a bit rushed.    Because of computer effects, the use of actors posthumously is on the rise.  Such is the case with Sir Laurence Olivier who was seen in a few scenes in \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\".  The actor passed in 1989.  But because of CGI and old video footage of the actor, he was still credited as playing Totenkopf.  The popularity of this new trend will depend on the individual moviegoer's tastes.     \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is not the best film but it isn't the worst film to come out of Hollywood.  It's just simple entertainment.  Although it is lacking in some parts, the movie provides a unique style of film making.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Excellent comic adaptation in a time when comic to movie flicks usually fall flat with the exception of a chosen few. Wait for early 2006 for an extra special edition jam packed with extra discs, extra special goodies amd everything else a body needs!!
B00009V7OL|5.0|Don't pay attention to the negative reviews here. This film is still one of the best ever, even more than 15 years later. James Cameron really made a masterpiece - forever solidifying his emminent status among film directors of all-time. Aliens and Titanic were both very good films, The Abyss is an excellent film, with the Director's cut rating slightly higher - I enjoyed the new ending best (I actually saw the director's cut before seeing the theatrical version). Recommended to all, especially sci/fi and action film lovers.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I am so glad that Joel Schumacher made this movie.  His insight and adaptation to Gaston LeRoux's book was superb.  I understand the minor changes he had to perform to make the movie a success, but what a success it is.  The singing is excellent as well as the cinematography.  This is defiantly the best adaptation of The Phantom Of the Opera made.  A perfect way to experience the work of art without actually going to the theater.
B0001DMPVI|3.0|Being an Eric Burdon freak, I certainly do like this CD. The best part is it contains one of the all time greatest singles Sky Pilot in the best mix and mastering I've heard so far. However, there a few things one wishes had been done differently. 2 songs feature one of the other band memebers on vocals. Eric would have been better, but that's history and the tunes are still quite enjoyable.  Seems to me to be an answer to Axis:Bold where Noel sings a couple. The tunes No Self Pity and We Are One are not exactly catchy tunes, but I would image would have been great on a psychedelic light drenched stage. The mono single of Sky Point is great. That tune is a totally differnt experience in mono. I think Eric is one of the few artists who I would call a mystical visionary.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I've only known Dream Theater's music for about three years or so, but I own all their albums.  Maybe it's because I'm a teenager, but I've noticed their music has changed for the better. Their early work is amazing, but after \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" (which is probably their best album to date), the level of creativity and intensity has improved a lot ever since Jordan Rudess joined the band.  Sometimes, its easy for fans to pigeon-hold a band to a specific type of sound they expect to get, but that shouldn't happen to Dream Theater, and I think both existing fans and new fans have to realize that it's better for a band to approach their music differently every time they make an album or a song.  Otherwise, the band becomes predictable and their music kind of loses originality and turns into dry and formulaic fan-pleasers.  That's not what Dream Theater is about.  DT is an incredibly talented group of musicians that can write amazing songs and are great performers live.  Octavarium seems like a reaction to Train of Thought (which was more on the dark/heavy side).  I think we should give time to their latest release to sink in and really absorb the music before bashing the work.
B000002R6A|5.0|I see this CD has gotten some bad reviews. I am sure this CD will now get the due it didn't in its own day. It's a sleeper classic.  Sure some people have a hard time understanding the CD. I would not attempt to get someone to appreciate this. You have to be of a particular mindset and understand Eric as a mystical visionary, in this case looking to the future of music.  This is their strongest LP since Winds OF Change (which I would call a neglected masterpice, as strong as Pepper and Sunshine Superman). Love Is was a few years ahead it's time, looking forward to other progresive excesses of the early 70s, to the likes of Hawkwind, Yes, and, the worst, sorry ELP. You have to like anything Eric does to appreciate the CD, if not, it will totally go over your head. They did not take the easy route with this LP. It keeps you on your toes with unpredictable changes, and never for the sake of them. The tunes make no claims to be perfect pop songs,(although River Deep is) yet it somehow manages to avoid just about every cliche in pop music as they use those excesses and cliches to their own ends in their attempt to move music forward. The band didn't burn out. Once again Eric did his thing and moved on just at the right moment. He never sold out. One of my favorites right now.
B000068PNQ|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of the 1960's, hands down. That said, this re-issue is an interesting idea, but it's definitely not going to please everyone. The mono mix of this album is superior and closer to what the band intended, but the differences are not dramatic and it's really the kind of thing that only a record-nerd like myself would care about. Buying this is certainly easier than trying to track down a mono copy of the record, that's for sure. It's only for a die-hard fan, and pointing out that it's easier for the casual fan to simply buy the single cd is beyond obvious. There are several albums from this era where the mono mix is noticably different and/or superior. The most striking instance is the first Pink Floyd album \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\" No one ever listens to me about this, but the difference between the stereo and mono mix of that album is like night and day, seriously. And the mono is so much better, I mean so much better, that the fact that only the stereo is commercially available is an autrocity. (Will someone please re-issue the mono mix of this album on cd like they did here with the Velvets). Any record-geek will tell you that Sgt. Pepper and The White Album are superior, or at least noticably different in mono. But the mono mix of this album is superior, but not dramatically so, and the original \\"closet\\" mix of the Velvets third album is more strikingly different than the mono mix of this album, and can be found as apart of the 5 CD Velvets box set. I think this was a noble effort that is easy to trash, because it's not worth it to most people to spend the extra money. I think it's probably the case that there aren't enough existing outtakes to make a 2cd set like the \\"Fully Loaded\\" version of the Velvets final album. The Nico solo stuff is not out of place either, as the Velvets were her band for these tracks so, in many respects, it's comparable to Femme Fetale, etc. Bottomline, the mono mix of this album was in demand. I'm happy to finally get a copy, especially on CD. I think this re-issue was a welcome one, but again, it's geared toward a completist. Personally, I bought my copy used on amazon for roughly the same amount of money that people are selling the single cd. If the difference is like 50 cents, please. Spend the extra money and get the two-disc set, why not. If it's twice the amount for the two-disc and you've never owned this album, obviously go for the single disc.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Coldplay has done something that many bands fear. They change things up. With their most recent release, the UK's pride and joy manages to try a new approach, while squeezing in some of those old howling at the moon pieces from A Rush of Blood to the Head.<br /><br />This album is more placid than the last one, and not as minimal as Parachutes. The synth is heavy on a few pieces, and the strings make a nice addition to X&Y.<br /><br />This is not as perfect as some here claim, as I'd put A Rush of Blood to the Head high above this one, but it's probably as soild as Parachutes.<br /><br />I think it's time to put the Radiohead comparisons to rest. The bands are only similar in that York and Martin can both falsetto at their leisure. Other than that, the comparisons are getting a bit annoying.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Here is another great album from Coldplay.  They are so talented in so many ways.  This album is really beautiful. We have yet to hear a bad album from them.  I'm really satisfied with this.  I suggest you pick this up.
B00097A5HW|2.0|Is the worst Shakira's cd ever, even worst than Magia, it's a bad copy of all the music we heard in the 80's... She lost her latin style. I love her music but this one is bad.. The lyrics are full of chiches like in No She shings 'Te juro, no miento' But in the latin music 9 of each 10 songs say that phrase... Oh Shakira What a bad album... but wait En tus pupilas is great, the sound-a-like Coldplay Cloks 'La pared' is good too... Lucky for the next time.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I've never quite understood the appeal of this band and just have to face the fact that I simply don't like them or their music. The songs do sound same-y and I hope that it's just that I haven't given it enough spins yet. Martin's voice sounds whiny and nasally and just annoying. It seriously grates.  <br /> <br /> Save your dough and just buy an old Pointer Sisters record.
B000002NZO|5.0|Trespass(1970) is Genesis' true debut. Even though Phil Collins and Steve Hackett have not joined the band yet, they still manage to piece together some good stuff. Anthony Phillips is a great guitarist and this is his last album for Genesis, sadly. John Mayhew, the second drummer, does a good job until the real drummer, Phil, comes in. The album starts with LOOKING FOR SOMEONE which really isn't a great start because it is mostly just dark and mysterious. WHITE MOUNTAIN is an excellent border between peaceful and fast. VISIONS OF ANGELS may be the most beautiful song on the album. STAGNATION is the best song on the cd as it is peaceful, mystical, dark, and mysterious. DUSK is the lightest song on the album that's sounds a bit like Gregorian chant. and last but definitely not least, THE KNIFE, a powerful song that wraps up the album beautifully. This Genesis album you should definitely own!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that my family and I have watched over and over and will watch again.  The characters ring true and are so diverse that anyone should be able to identify with one or more of them.  With all their faults and problems, they are still likable and very human.  Who would think that a movie dealing with loneliness, depression, suicide, alcoholism, abandonment and anger could be so positive, happy and inspiring, while still ringing true? The message of caring and love is powerful and moving, no matter how many times I have seen it.   <br /> <br />This movie is also cleverly funny.  Hugh Grant (and everyone else) is wonderful.  The music is perfect. <br /> <br />Highly recommended - one of my all-time favorites.
0064407667|5.0|The Bad Beginning is a good book, however, if you like stories about children who go on magnificent adventures and defeat evil villans, this book is not for you. But if you like stories about three orphans who have lost there parents in a fire and must now go live with an evil distant relative named Count Olaf who makes them do back-braking chores and has them all sleep in a room with one small bed. A story in which the orphans must cook dinner for a evil theater troop while being scolded by Count Olaf, who strikes an orphan in the face for standing up for himself and his baby sister. If you enjoy all those miserable things, you just might enjoy this book.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Well, I've listened to the entire album twice now and lemmie tell ya, if you're looking for the same type of stuff at ToT (i.e. hard metal), you won't find it except on a few tracks. \\"Octavarium\\" is a great album, though. DT is always expanding on their musicality and this one is definitely no exception. Instead of songs that are all over 10 minutes, they shorten them up and make them a lot more \\"to the point\\" with less of the crazy guitar solos. I know some of you might be disappointed about that (I was, too), but it really makes the album more complete with a few tight, thoughtful tracks.  <br /> <br />The last two tracks plus \\"Panic Attack\\" are my favorite. \\"Panic Attack\\" sounds exactly like it should. It's a fast paced song, with more of ToT feel because of the metal feeling in it. \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is an excellent 10-minute song, similar to the style of \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" from ToT, but a lot better. The last track, however, is a whole different story. \\"Octavarium\\" will most definitely blow your socks off as I'm listening to it right now. It starts of very mellow, but, obviously, really gets into it later in the song. This is Dream Theater's new magnum opus song and it is a killer. I can't describe it through words, but the cost of the album is definitely worth the price of just listening to the title track \\"Octavarium.\\" <br /> <br />If you came to Dream Theater through Train of Thought, you may be a little surprised at the new sound of DT, but do realize that this is a PROGRESSIVE band and they can do whatever they want. I highly recommend this album to anybody wanting to expand their progressive rock collection and add a truly magnificent album.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Like so many other devoted Coldplay fans, I had been anticipating the arrival of \\"X & Y\\" for a loooong time...and as I fully expected, it was more than worth the wait. Chris Martin's voice has never sounded more emotional, harmonious, glorious, and the fellows in the band back his vocals with strong, sweeping insturmentation that is nothing short of beautiful.  Naysayers can say what they will, Coldplay have already established their own unique sound and do not remind me of U2 in any way (save for their powerful, passionate musical delivery); they have proven they are one powerhouse of a band to contend with and in my humble opinion will continue to do so for years to come.<br /><br />This is a fabulous album that I will be returning to again and again in coming days, weeks, months, years...it's that wonderful!! Stand out tracks for me are \\"Speed of Sound\\", \\"What If\\", \\"Square One\\", and my personal favorite, title track \\"X & Y\\"-majestically stunning~Chris' vocals and the orchestration on this one turn my bones to mush!!! :-)
B00008PC2O|3.0|There are several complains about this DVD release. <br /> <br />first of all, They said that they had sacrificed DTS soundtrack to Transfer better picture. but something does not seem right! what's the difference between this package's Disc 1 and the ultimate edition's disc one? I have both of them and absolutely there is no difference except the ultimate edition has an additional DTS soundtrack. Extreme edition has a new audio commentary but it doesn't take much space. there was enough space to put DTS on this release too! <br /> <br />Second complain is, the High definition version of the movie which is available on Disc 2, only works on Computer and only on an expensive absolutely powerful and up to date computer! so if you don't have any, you'll have no chance to play it even with problem! most of people have 17\\" or 19\\" flat monitor and a little have widescreen big monitors. would anybody enjoy watching a high difinition movie in a 17\\" monitor except watching a regular transfer in a big screen TV? I don't think so! <br /> <br />If you read my review, and if you don't have the Ultimate edition, buy that release and never think of this one!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Dream Theater's newest release, Octivarium is nothing less than spectacular.  Topping Train of Thought in almost every way, this is a must buy for any Dream Theater fan.  I definatly see some Megadeth and Genesis influence.  Genesis being my favourtie band, I enjoy the keyboard revolved prog, which is Octivarium.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is excellent and the production is simply impeccable. The band mentioned that they listened to a lot of late 70's/80's bands like Depeche Mode and Kraftwerk during the making of this album, and it definitely shows. Some of the riffs and melodies do sound like rip offs (the main riff in Talk (currently my favorite) totally sounds like Kraftwerk and a lot of the vocals/bass lines sound like they came from mid-80's U2 or Duran Duran), but it all works really well.
B0006L16N8|5.0|X&Y is like Rush Of Blood To The Head but just a lot better.  Their songs still retain their mystical spacy dreamscape kind of sound, which all Coldplay fans love.  A must buy.
B00005ATZT|5.0|The fugitive is asmart movie and you must try to keep up with what's happening.  Richard Cimble sure is a smart doctor.  He found out who killed his wife and who set it up.  Tommy Lee Jones and his gang of U.S. marshalls are funny and smart.  There was lots of suspensful scenes in this movie, heck the whole movie was suspensful.  I really think this was in the top ten for best films of the 90's.  Harrison ford gets to play a smart person in the Fugitive and in Indiana ?Jones.  There was so many great clues in this movie.  I'm glad they got a special edition out so there could be more special features.  One of my favorite scenes is when Harrison is to jumps of that cliff thing and into the ocean.  Right before that the greatest lines in the movie happened.  Harrison is pointing a gun at Tommy and he says I did not kill my wife.  Tommy then says I don't care.  Classic Tommy Lee Jones.  This movie is the perfect running time and everything in this movie is just perfect.  Great job by the director.
B00097A5I6|3.0|There is no question that the past two efforts by Oasis were, on the whole, fairly weak. They each had their bright tracks, but they failed to showcase the talents and the appeal that Oasis displayed on their first three albums. On 'Don't Believe the Truth' the Gallagher boys and company seem to have their feet set on the right path again. <br /> <br />On the whole this album still doesn't compare to the lofty music that Oasis made on their earlier efforts, but at the same time it certainly eclipses their two most recent efforts by a landslide. Tracks to note are \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\", \\"Part of the Queue\\", \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\", and perhaps the closest thing to an anthem circa \\"Champagne Supernova\\", the fantastically stirring \\"Let There Be Love\\". The latter track is the clearest glimpse of what Oasis could be if they stuck to making more huge, melodic, arena-rocking songs of old (\\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\", \\"Live Forever\\") instead of pumping out songs that simply don't catch on as quickly or nearly as deeply. Though \\"Let There Be Love\\" borders on being outright cheesy, it's immediate appeal and heartfelt connection is undeniable, and it would do Oasis much good if they tried making more songs like it. <br /> <br />Oasis has done a great job of rocking out in a refined and vintage way, almost on the verge of sounding like a different band altogether, but Liam's jeering singing and Noel's ever-improving voice anchor the album. In fact, the tracks Noel sings almost outshine his brother's tracks. <br /> <br />Their fans will be satisfied, and those new to Oasis will be intrigued but most likely not totally won over. On 'Don't Believe the Truth' Oasis finally gives us hope that all is not lost and that a couple more good albums may yet be on the way.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album was bought for me as a present by my mate who insited i needed to start listening to \\"quality music\\". <br />all i can do is claim that he is the best friend in the world as this album is what drew me away from the pop nonsense i had been listening to and opnened my ears to excellent music. <br /> <br />every song is its own story and music and the meaning behind every note is obviously so important to Yorke that his vocals urge you to listen again and again to gain a greater understanding as to what this album is saying.  <br /> <br />I find that each song evolves into someting new i listen to it and it is so easy to get lost when having this as background music.  <br /> <br />I LOVE IT!
B0002KQNUO|5.0|I saw \\"Alegria\\" when it came to my area, and the show took my breath away.  I have seen both \\"O\\" and \\"Dralion,\\" and heard samplings of other Cirque shows, but \\"Alegria\\" has perhaps the most upbeat songs on it.  Favorites include the title track, 'Vai Vedrai,' and 'Querer.'<br /><br />Definitely worth your money, and it provides very ecclectic listening/mood music.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is a very good album. Very good. I saw this guy live and he amazed me and his talent definitely comes through better on this album than it did on the first. <br /> <br />Buble's voice has improved and as has his musical understanding, with his treatment of songs and their melodies is much more mature and strong. The aarangements are very cool and fresh, with touching ballads \\"Home\\" and \\"You Don't Know Me\\", to fun, uptempo songs \\"How Sweet It Is\\" and \\"Feeling Good\\". I love this album and Buble's voice just makes the record. He really is very talented and knows how to show it off!
B0001DI0FI|4.0|I'm a long running fan of Russell Crowe so needless to say I had to see this movie as soon as it was released.  I was expecting something much different...the previews made it appear to be not stop battles and what not, so after the first viewing I was a bit dissapointed.  Yes, Crowe is astonishing as usual and he has every bit of what it takes to COMMAND a role, and that he does here.  It wasn't until seeing it for the second time that I started to appreciate it more, you know, for what it was.  What it is is a great naval movie, not more or less about the battles and the death but about the life people led living on the ships, never seeing home.  The small sub plots which at first I felt took away from what I was waiting for actually served their purpose after watching it again.  The film is beautifully shot, and the authenticity of the set and sounds make you feel as though you are bellow deck with the crew.  In closing I feel that this is a great addition to any DVD collection, and although it may not be what you wanted, if you look at it for what it is you will be not only impressed but quite satisfied.
B0002MPU1K|3.0|When i got Peter Cincotti's first album, i was VERY dissapointed and so i was pleased to find this album an improvement and mush better <br /> <br />HOWEVER, i get frustrated at the naivety that overshadows Cincotti's recordings. Songs such as \\"You don't know me\\" sound as if he has only just heard them for the first time and not EXPERIENCED them, which is what he lacks when placed up against Buble or Cullum. His piano playing is amazing but for me simply interrupts the carefree singing in between. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, \\"St. Louie Blues\\" and \\"On the Moon\\" are very very good, but the other songs drag behind, sounding like test recordings before Cincotti actually takes his time to feel the songs and PERFORM them.  <br /> <br />He is a raw talent that could be so much better, and i hope he does so by his third album, as i really don't want to be dissapointed again. The rating has been given for the quality of two/three of the songs, not the album overall.
B00005JNTX|3.0|Ok so I already wrote a review for this, a pretty long one at that and for some reason it never showed up so I'm writing another one.  I wanted to say that this movie, although not AMAZING as some would think, was actually really really good for what it was.  I walked into this movie with different expectations, not to say that my expectations were better, just different.  I've never read the comics and maybe thats why it was so weird for me, but it stayed true to comic style in writing and camera shot.  Because of the comic style dialog it comes across quite corny.  That aside, you have to look at this film with different eyes.  Your not watching a film, your watching art.  And I might say, Rodriguez paints one amazing picture.  The imagry, the omage to Miller, the tribute to the comic was really amazing.  As I said, I've never read the comics, but after seeing the movie I picked up a few at the bookstore and flipped through, and I might have to say that Rodriguez did Miller proud.  The plot is full of twists and turns, small subplots that interwine together all involving strippers, hookers, canibals and pedophiles.  The first story revolves around Marv whos been set up by canibals to take the fall for the murder of a hooker.  He sets out to find her killer and ends up taking the rap for it in the end.  The second revolves around (Clive Owen) who is defending his girlfreind from her abusive x and starts a war between the hookers and the cops.  The last revolves around Hartigan (Bruce Willis)who in the opening saves a girl from being raped by a pedophile and is shot (what apears like to death) but we see is really hospitalized.  Things happen and 8 years pass and he now has the chance to save the now grown up stripper (played by Jessica Alba) from the pedophile again.  The plot is really moot compaired to the briliant way the film is shot.  The violence is brutal and relentless, but since 90% is done in black and white it really isn't as graphic as it could be and for all you horny men out there who are vying to see Jessica Alba naked...she doesn't!  The film is really a hodgepodge of scenes and to be quite frank after walking out it took me a while to rememeber what happened to whom.  Don't go for the acting, don't go for the story, go for Roberts art...and you'll be happy you did.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road, first off, is one of the greatest albums ever. It's not just because of the insanely magnificent songwriting or the delicious mood of the album that makes it so great, but also because of the overall \\"togetherness\\" of the album.  <br /> <br />The cohesiveness of this album (and it truly is an \\"album;\\" all the tracks support and enhance one another even though most would be great songs on their own) is nothing short of spectacular. The mechanical chords of \\"Come Together,\\" the title itself expressing the feeling throughout the album, progress into the splendid \\"Something.\\" The first five songs are the most individualistic, but nevertheless, they still have a wonderful shared purpose in the big picture.  <br /> <br />By the end of the sixth track, the album reaches its pinnacle, where it stays for the remainder. The gentle sparklings of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" emerge softly from the deafening silence left by the muscular ending of \\"I Want You,\\" leaving the listener bewildered.  <br /> <br />The remainder of the album is nothing short of spectacular. Such magnificent creativity has not been felt since. The orchestral theme of \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" reappears at the end of \\"Carry that Weight,\\" while \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" alludes to \\"Polythene Pam.\\" Gaps between songs are eliminated, and the general impression of the album is that it is an almost constant flow of musical greatness.  <br /> <br />The true themes of the album are ends, both false and unexpected. From the abrupt ending of \\"I Want You\\" to the actual song \\"The End\\" which, in typical Beatles fashion is not the end of the CD, the Fab Four always keep you on the edge of your seat. But most of all, Abbey Road signified the end of the Beatles reign, something that everyone knew would have to come yet all dreaded it. Luckily, unlike so many other great bands, the Beatles left on a high note, leaving behind for us a wonderful piece of music.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I had my first listen to this album while exercising on an elliptical machine at the gym with headphones on.  I was expecting to hear more of the same as  from their two previous cd's, both of which I loved.  In fact, after listening to X&Y more than a few times, I felt inspired to listen to  Parachutes and A Rush of Blood To The Head.  X&Y is an impressive display of the versatility Coldplay possesses.  It is my opinion that X&Y has a more \\"sonic\\" sound, as opposed to the \\"rock\\" sound of the two previous cd's.  I especially like the use of strings, organ, more piano, and acoustic guitar on X&Y.  Chris Martin uses more of the upper register and falsetto of his voice here, more so than on the previous two cd's. And he uses it with great ease and naturalness.  One customer reviewer felt that Chris Martin was attempting to sound like Bono.  Bono does use a lot of falsetto in his singing, but his vocal quality is angst driven, with a sense of urgency.  But Chris Martin sings with a sensitive expression of pain, and matters of the heart.  Both of these singers are great, but they are very different - almost dramatically.  For those listeners who are critical of Coldplay for trying something different with X&Y, well, one must understand that great artists make creative efforts not to repeat themselves, but to experiment and to take risks.  I would not be surprised if Coldplay's next cd moves in a direction different from X&Y.  I respect their courage to stretch their talents - and enormous talents they surely are.  I applaud Coldplay.
B00097A5HW|5.0|We have to admit that with a title like Fijacion Oral one expects to listen nothing but a bunch of loud beats and uncalled nonsense. But what a great surprise when, past the contagious notes of lead single \\"La tortura\\", fears disolve in front of a bouquet of melodies and emotions not exactly a trademark of the colombian singer's previous releases. It is true that we won't hear her singing about looking for a lover in her purse or in Botero's paintings (circa Pies Descalzos), but there is still a candid approach to the lyrics that has made her songs both appealing and puzzling. In Fijacion oral we come face to face with a Shakira that shares her passion and the sense of emptiness a love she has already experienced may bring once it's gone, as opossed to the longing for an unknown feeling that we tasted in the other two albums. It shows a more mature approach to life, love and music in general. The definite highlight is \\"La pared\\" (track that appears in two versions), with its grasping chorus and a performance so beautifully delivered that it can only be compared to the classic \\"Antologia\\". It is precisely in this harmonious voice that Fijacion oral finds its anchor, among a collection of rhythms that go from the poppy \\"Las de la intuicion\\" (the only song in this album to remind us of earlier times), to bossa nova (\\"Obtener un si\\"), to the perfect composition of \\"Dia especial\\", which she co-wrote and performed with latin legend Gustavo Ceratti, that otherwise would be a complete chaos. <br />Toward the end we face the flaw that she might as well skipped: \\"Lo imprescindible\\" sounds indeed quite innovative with the rapid switch of tempo, but fails to close an album that could arguably be Shakira's masterpiece.  <br />Absolutely brethtaking moments and still a lot of fun, Fijacion oral is a delight not destines to please anyone but those who believed Shakira can go beyond mud crawling and hip shaking.
1883010039|4.0|The most important thing I learned from this book is that I'm not ready for this book!  I inherited my mother's table loom some time ago and have not had time to look into weaving until recently.  To get myself started, I purchased a number of books on weaving so that I could build up to tackling her loom.  I found both \\"Weaving Without a Loom\\" and \\"You Can Weave\\" very helpful for a beginner.  They taught simple terminology, basic weaves, the use of a variety of materials not only for weaving but for looms, and the use of patterns.  Chandler and Redding's book, \\"Learning to Weave,\\" looks to be an excellent resource for weaving on my table loom, but just perusing it's pages, I realized that I still need to work a little with the simpler looms before getting on to the main task.  In reading the book, I found the notion of samples a fine idea.  I started making them with some of the simpler looms, and have even found a use for some of the samples I've made.  The suggestion regarding practice color combinations was also helpful.  In looking forward to the daunting task of warping or dressing my table loom, I suspect that the authors' suggestions with respect to managing the warp threads and the alternative suggestions with respect to approaching the physical task itself will make my first experience much less frustrating.  But first we have to build up the courage!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|When I picked up the AP late last year with the review on 2005 albums I read that A7X's new cd wasn't going to be for the hardcore kids...and they were right. But, all that aside I love this cd. It's very different, and it shows the real singing talent of M.Shadows, and not to mention the relentless melody assault brought every time by A7X. Not as diverse as \\"Waking The Fallen\\" but this disc shines on more of A7X's influences, such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Queen. They are easily our generation's new Maiden. fav. songs on this disc: Beast and The Harlot, Trashed and Scattered, Bat Country, Seize The Day<br /><br />if you don't have this cd yet, and you are a fan of A7X and are not afraid to open up to a more old school feel, pick this thing up ASAP!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|8th studio album, 8 Songs, 8 keys in the octave. Starting with the \\"key of F on this album and ending in F\\" according to an interview by Jordan if I remember correctly. Speaking of Jordan, he comes to the forefront on this album which kinda leaves Petrucci in a supporting role.  The guitar is there but not like it used to be. The cool melody lines of the old albums are not present and really haven't been for a while. The crunchy rythmn riffs are there but....Portnoy is learning to lay back and groove a little instead cramming drum roll/fills everywhere.  Over all, this is a good album. Not great. It's up there as one of their better efforts. A lot of big nods to their influences.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Simply Can't Say it Enough The OC Is Defenitly an Amazing SHow I own The First Season, ANd Cant wait to ORder THe New One!! WoohooO!! <br /> <br />The only downside Im not a Fan of Widescreen and SO I hear it is Widescreen.. Which is kinda a downfall however thank God for ZOOM!! lol.. Cept that takes away Picture but i'll deal with it.. The Oc is Definitly worth it!
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is spacey, blurred, ambient, and filled with sonic sound. It's Coldplay's fully developed sound. And yea yea, it takes time for this one to make sense for you, it's something you have to expect though. The album cover with the coded message X&Y is a perfect representation of the album. At first listen it's a massive wall of ambient sound, but with each spin, you decode more and more of it, until it finally clicks.  <br /> <br />Every song stands out in it's own way, for me though, \\"X&Y\\" is the best song on the cd, it's the center piece of the whole album.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I love System Of A Down, I have always thought they were a great band, but it seems to me like their last two albums simply havent lived up to potential. Steal This Album was well lets be honest here it was down right bad. Mezmerize is good but I truly think the boys in System are seariously capable of a lot better then what they are putting out. Daron Malakians guitar is just as amazing as it always is and Serj's vocals are great like usual but I dont think they put all they had into this album.<br /><br />The intro to the album is nice hard and heavy which should have set the pace for the rest of the album, but it simply just does not. 'B.Y.O.B' is the best song on the album and it's track number two. Theres nothing wrong with that but it leaves the rest of the album comming up short, or at least in my openion it does. The guitar riff to B.Y.O.B. is one of the best guitar riffs I have heard in a long time, and I love the lyrics because they are so true. One thing System Of A Down can do is right a political song, and do it well. 'Sweet Revenga' is the next song and I like this song, it has a nice catchy chorus and once again some pretty cool guitar tricks by Daron. 'Cigaro' is next, it's a pretty funny song, but it also has a killer chorus. I love Cigaro. After Cigaro however, the album just feels empty. I still like the rest of the songs but I just don't feel that they are really worth mentioning. The guitar is great through out the rest of the album and the vocals and lyrics are good as well. However one of my complaints on this album is that the drummer is a really good drummer but it doesnt show on Mezmerize and the same can be said for the bass player, they are truly talented musicians but they are not doint what they are capable of. The biggest highlight of this album is that Daron wrote most of everything, and he sings more on this album then he has one all the past Sytem Of A Down albums combined. It adds a really  nice touch to the album and the sound of the vocals and music, they should really layer Serj's and Daron's vocals more often.<br /><br />All I can say is this is not an album for our everyday hard rock fan or you casual System Of A Down fan but more for a hardcore fanatic. While this is a good album I really belieave it could have been a great album!f the vocals and music, they should really layer Serj's and Daron's vocals more often. <br /> <br />All I can say is this is not an album for our everyday hard rock fan or you casual System Of A Down fan but more for a hardcore fanatic. While this is a good album I really belieave it could have been a great album!
B00004Z459|5.0|I can remember when I was younger listening to Linkin Park blaring on the speakers from my sister's car just about everytime she drove me somewhere. Music didn't have too much of an effect on me then, but I just thought the songs were just amazing then and still do. Years later, and I discovered the band for real and borrowed \\"Hybrid Theory\\" from a friend. It has yet to be returned. Linkin Park have a sound that combines rap elements with rock in a truly unique original way that's only theirs. Too describe the band I'll start with the band's two vocalists. Chester Bennington's vocals include of mostly screaming hooks, but unlike popular belief the guy can do things other than scream as heard in hits like \\"In The End\\" and \\"Crawling\\" The other vocalist Mike Shinoda is the rapper of the group and his rapping flows clearly and goes perfect with Chester's to add to the unique sound of the band. The DJ of the band plays a big role in the sound and uses his scratching and sampling for a very cool unique effect. The album itself is truly an enjoyable thing to listen too. Every song on the album is a hit from begining to end, even the instrumental \\"Cure For The Itch\\" which really shows the DJ's talent. From heavier, angrier, faster  tracks like the hits \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"Points of Authority\\" to the lesser knowns \\"Forgotten\\" and \\"By Myself\\" Too the softer more balanced tracks where the band really shines in radio hits \\"In The End\\" and \\"Crawling\\" I highly reccomend this album to any music listeners, even the more \\"hardcore\\" listener of music should give this album a try, I doubt you'll be disapointed.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I feel that this is the most simplistic album to date. One might get a little bored with it 'cause nothing really jumps out at you but nonetheless very solid. James voice hasn't really changed at all and I do grow weary of the ballads on every album. <br />I highly recommend 'Awake' and 'Infinity'
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is certainly back in the limelight with their new release \\"X&Y\\", but 2002's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" represents their finest work so far.  This album truly belongs in 5-star modern rock company along with \\"OK Computer\\", \\"Disintegration\\" and \\"The Joshua Tree\\".   <br /> <br />Many will already be familiar with mega-hit singles \\"In My Place\\", \\"Clocks\\" and \\"The Scientist\\", but the best material lies in the other album tracks.  \\"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face\\" combines a slinky acoustic stomp with an uplifting chorus that's impossible not to sing along with.  The title track may be the band's most straightforward rock song, combining bluesy and dreamy elements into a sound reminiscent of classic Pink Floyd.  \\"Amsterdam\\" is a heart-breakingly beautiful ballad that closes the album with its emotional crescendo.   <br /> <br />\\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is one of those rare, once-in-an-artist's-career moments when all elements come together perfectly.  Songwriting, performance, and emotional depth and variety make this album a must-have for any modern rock fan.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is better than their previous work...by a landslide in my opinion. I could actually play this album all year and not get tired of it. I can't really see why people are hanging onto AROBTTH so much and insist on living in the dark ages. I agree with the person who said that \\"X&Y\\" was sweeping and epic. This is one of the best CD's of 2005. This is a huge step forward for Coldplay. I can't complain. I just listen and enjoy the ride. But I do feel like I'm making a greater emotional connection with \\"X&Y\\" than with AROBTTH. I have to really question when I read that nothing stands out. People picked apart U2's album last year on Amazon for no good reason. Just a lot of mindless whining and complaining. I hope the reviews for \\"X&Y\\" don't deteriorate in that fashion. This is really a great album that can appeal to any age or gender. People should really take a few good listens and judge the album based upon its own merits first before comparing it to a previous work. It's been 3 years. When you slice the cake it's not going to be exactly the same. Thank God Coldplay didn't just go back into the studio and record a twin. It's called evolution. There are remnants of AROBTHH, but I find the \\"X&Y collection far more enjoyable.
B000002BYD|5.0|One of those CDs that you need to listen to it a few times through, but once you do, OH MAN.  Best three songs in a row, on any rock album since: MFC, Low Light, In Hiding.  Listen to the (sort of) radio songs first (Do the Evolution, Wishlist, Given to Fly). <br /> <br />This album ROCKS and ROCKS HARD.
B00005JNTV|4.0|I really enjoyed watching Sin City. It is just like the Graphic Novels came to life. The special effects are wonderful.<br /><br />This movie surely stands out in the crowd. No other movie that I can think of has looked this way.<br /><br />The movie is made for the comic book crowd, and stays true to form.<br /><br />Some of the blood and guts got to me alittle, and I had to shut my eyes. But still a good flick.
B000002H33|5.0|I would give anything to go back in time to 1986. Reign in Blood was kicking the world's ass, Megadeth was Selling Peace, and prog shred just started to hit the air waves. More importantly, Master of Puppets was released and it defined Metallica. It was their climax, their epic, their swan song. From the fires of Battery, to the onslaught of Disposable Heroes, to the majesty of Orion, to The Thing That Should Not Be, the album defys the mortal coil of metal and proclaims itself god. Though Slayer is the king of my metal empire, Master of Puppets is incredibly significant, with only the spitefully fast fury that is Damage Inc. holding them back from perfection. Obey your Master.
B000002UAX|5.0|I'm not going to lie about it, I love this album. I think it's The Beatles best work, although Abbey Road is amazing as well, and a fine example of excellent musicianship. Pretty much all the songs on this album are absolute masterpieces and  it lets all four of The Beatles have their share of the limelight. <br /> <br />Everything starts off with Paul's Back In The USSR which takes inspiration from both Chcuk Berry and The Beach Boys, and wraps it all in The Beatles style. It's a great number which is very easy to listen to, and it also has some very nice guitar work, courtesy, as usual, of George. Next up is John's Dear Prudence, which his second son Sean did an excellent cover of in 1990 or round about, and it's a great song. It's much more quiet than Back In The USSR, but things get a little louder again with Glass Onion with is basically John's sequel to both Strawberry Fields Forever and I Am The Walrus. He mentions some of the mysteries surrounding the other songs, and adds even more clues to the whole \\"Paul is dead\\" theory as well. It's a good song, if not as enjoyable as Strawberry Fields Forever or I Am The Walrus. The next song is Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da which was recently voted one of the worst songs of all time. I can see why some people don't like it but I don't think it lessens the impact of the album in any way. Included in the rest of the first album of this double album is The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill, a great John song, followed by what is possibly George's best song... While My Guitar Gently Weeps. It's wonderfully structured and, of course, it includes an amazing guitar solo by guest musician Eric Clapton, as George wasn't confident enough to try the complicated solo himself. George's other song on album number one is Piggies, which is basically about the police. It's a great song, with some nice semi-sarcastic comments. Ringo also has his songwriting debut with Don't Pass Me By, a country style number later on in the album. It's good, but Iprefer Ringo's other songwriting attempt on Abbey Road, Octopus' Garden. Then we have John's Happiness Is A Warm Gun which, like A Day In The Life, consists of a few songs strung together, and it's very well done. We also have his Julia, a touching tribute to both his mother and his new love Yoko, and I;m So Tired, which has an interesting bit of mumble jumble at the end of the song where he's muttering and, when played backwards, it very clearly says \\"Paul is a dead man... miss him... miss him... miss him\\". Don't believe me? Go and play it backwards and see. <br /> <br />Album number two maybe isn't as good as the first but it includes some pretty famous numbers and one of the most notorious moments in The Beatles' history. First, we have Paul's song Birthday which is good but is followed up by John's amazing Yer Blues, which he later played live on his Live Peace In Toronto album. It's a stark song and a million miles away from the days of Love Me Do, She Loves You and I Wanna Hold Your Hand. Speaking of dark, we also have one of Paul's best Helter Skelter which, as you probably know, was the song that inspired Charles Manson to kill Sharon Tate. George's Piggies is also supposed to have contributed to this murderous rampage. John has two other shining moments on the album with Revolution 1 which had prmeiered in a faster, more rocking, version as the B-side to the Hey Jude single shortly before The White Album was released. Revolution 1 is a slower version but still retains it's edge. John's other great moment is Cry Baby Cry which is one of those songs that is very easy to listen to again, and again. <br /> <br />Of course, you have to talk about Revolution 9 when you review The White Album. Originally intended as the end of Revolution 1, it's basically a series of strange noises and sounds effects with the sound sof marching, talking, shouting, cars, fires... just about everything. I understand why people don't like it but as a fan of John and Yoko's later avant garde work, I think it's a wonderful piece of work. Like John says, he probably spent more time on that song than any other he ever did when he was working as a Beatle. The album finally finishes off with Good Night, a lullaby John wrote to his son Julian, which is sung by Ringo. It's of a much lesser quality than the rest of the album, but it's still a good number. <br /> <br />And that's it... The Beatles... The White Album. It doesn't get much better than this. I suggest getting this and Abbey Road so you can finally see why everyone calls The Beatles the best band in the history of music.
B000002H2H|5.0|Never has there been a more well-rounded thrash/speed metal album revolving around death. From the unbelievably fast riffing in Fight Fire with Fire to the classic irresistable guitarness of Ride the Lightning to the powerhouse metal coiled with For Whom the Bell Tolls, Metallica kicks the ass of the music that you've been listening to in just the first 3 tracks. Trapped Under Ice and Creeping Death are quite thrashy, while Escape provides likable melodies in a change of pace and Call of the Ktulu ends the album in an epic, creepy instrumental. Fade to Black; however, dominates as the best song on the album, as well as one of the band's best work. Mixing acoustic clean mastery with haunting vocals/lyrics and piercing solos, it's enough to make one forget about the latest homogenous numetal 'album' they picked up because of that catchy radio hit they like. Own this or be owned.
B000002UAR|5.0|With their previous album, Rubber Soul, The Beatles had shown that they weren't going to stick to the pop norms of the time, and they tried many different things. Revolver goes further with this, and includes some amazing numbers. It's a great transition between Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and is definitely worth your time. <br /> <br />The album starts off with what is probably George's first \\"great\\" song, called Taxman. It was unusual for an album to start off with a song not penned by John or Paul but it proves that George was just as capable as those two. The next number is Eleanor Rigby by Paul and is also a little mini-masterpiece. It's actually quite a dark number, and I always liked the \\"lonely people\\" intro. Then we move on to John's I'm Only Sleeping which is possibly my favorite song on this album. A great number, with a backwards guitar solo, which was one of the first instances of this (their single Paperback Writer/Rain had been released just before this and the song Rain contained a backwards section). These first three songs by George, Paul and John, respectively, are a great little trilogy and an excellent start to the album, showing the talents of these three members of the band. <br /> <br />Ringo would also get a little chance to shine with his lead vocals on Yellow Submarine. A wonderful, catchy tune, about LSD disguised as a nursery rhyme, it's become a favorite of both adults and children and, of course, was the basis for the animated Beatles film. <br /> <br />Of course, For No One, Here, There and Everywhere, Tomorrow Never Knows, to choose but a few, are all great songs as well, with Tomorrow Never Knows providing a great segue-way into the trippiness of Sgt. Pepper.
1400034779|5.0|Oh, how I love these stories. I read Tears of the Giraffe first (see Amazon review of 5/24/05), and loved it. I would recommend, as with all series, that you begin here with The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. This is where you get the full background about how the agency got started, about its proprietress, Precious Ramotswe; Mma Ramotswe's beloved Daddy, Obed; and her friend J.L.B. Matekoni, and others. You'll fall in love with Mma Ramotswe's Africa as well.<br /><br />The story takes place in Botswana, a country just north of South Africa. Botswana is a democracy and has done very well for itself since the mid-sixties when it gained its independence. Precious Ramotswe, who is always called Mma Ramotswe, opens the first and only detective agency in Africa run by a woman, after the death of her father. She is a very clever woman, quite plump, too, which is a good thing...she refers to her build as the \\"traditional\\" build of the Botswana female. She is very proud of her size and her brain, which she puts to good use in helping people solve the \\"problems in their lives.\\"<br /><br />The book is a series of events of a social, personal, and business nature and moves easily along and keeps the reader interested. The best way I can describe McCall Smith's writing is that it has class, from his vocabulary to his style. The story flows smoothly from one page to another; one chapter to another; and even horrible events in people's life are served up with a kind of dignity as presented from the viewpoint of Mma Ramotswe. While Mma is a very gracious and polite lady, she can be ruthless when dealing with vile, evil, and unscrupulous individuals. In the end, she is not afraid of anybody or anything! I'd love to meet her...if she were only real!!<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill
B000002UDB|4.0|Originally released as an EP in the UK to accompany the TV film of the same name and expanded to a full album, using several singles, in the US, the \\"album\\" version was the one released on CD, and is the one widely available now. <br /> <br />Personally, I don't think that the singles mix well with the rest of the songs but, hey, any Beatles is good Beatles, that's my opinion. However, the original EP songs are very enjoyable. Magical Mystery Tour is a nice Paul song but he really shines with The Fool On The Hill which is a great, well written song. I also like his Your Mother Should Know. Sure, it's cheesy, but it's catchy and I always liked the way it is used in the Magical Mystery Tour film. Flying is a rare moment in the Beatles catalogue, as it is an instrumental. It's actually quite good, but it's not something that I listen to a lot. In fact, I've only probably listened to it a couple of times since I bought the album. George's song Blue Jay Way isn't his best but it's enjoyable none the less. <br /> <br />The real masterpiece on this album, in my opinion, is John's song I Am The Walrus which started the whole \\"who is the walrus?\\" mystery. Of course, in the end, it all ties up to the whole \\"Paul is dead\\" thing. There's plenty of websites that deal with this subject so I won't go any further, as there are much better places where you can read up on it. <br /> <br />Sandwhiched between Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club and The White Album, two of The Beatles' finest works, the Magical Mystery Tour EP/Album is often forgotten but it contains a couple of gems and is well worth picking up.
B0000024SI|5.0|With apologies to Dan Berg, this was the new American language, the most compelling, surging songwriting in English, during the mid century. I'd been content, pretty much with radio fare. And if my favourites weren't getting played sufficiently, or had gone off the boil, I purchased a 45 of Pitney's, Mecca, or Manfred Mann's,'Do Wah Diddy Diddy'. One summer Saturday morning, I indulged in hitherto unprecedented behaviour. First, at the newsagent, I bought a copy of the new national daily, The Australian. Hoping to nurture my budding curiosity, I honed in on the 'arts' section where a generous and probing review of an unknown (to me) Bob Dylan impelled me to a second purchase that morning at the local record bar.Have you got,'Another Side of Bob Dylan'? I tended. 'No. But we've got his latest\\". I swooped in on'Highway 61', my first LP. So much of my remaing teenage years were literally galvanised to Bob. As fanatical as I was about my weekend sports, I sat transfixed over the old portable player, returning its arm into the groove that gave over those 11.20 minutes of,'Desolation Row.' In two and a half hours I had them burned into my mind. For the first and only time in my life I missed the beginning of my sport's event and was incapable of explaining my waywardness.That night, in the town's only stairwell where sufficient chamber had allowed me to unconvincingly croon,'Unchained Melody' I had no difficulty in mimicking the raspy weariness of Bob. Mr Jones, Dr.Filth, Ezra Pound, the Graveyard Woman, Queen Jane and the Junkyard Angel, a trunkload of freaks and lost souls driven mad by surging rock rythyms, would lead me into temptation and console me through my romantic bittersweet youth. It was a hard if not impossible act to follow. Only Bob did so with the sprawlingly fecund,'Blonde On Blonde'. He was the measuring stick for the Bobby Linds' (Butterfly of Love) the Phil Ochs'(Pleasures of the Harbour), the Eric Andersons'(Blue River). I waited breathlessly for whathe might offer. There'd been nothing like his fullness in my life. The profundity of ,'John Wesley Harding' was yet to come with his cast pruned to less flamboyant if more archetypal beings, the Wicked Messenger, the Drifter,the Immigrant,the Joker and the Thief. But it was 61 I travelled first and most formidably; a Saturday morning riven in my life, propelling me into the power of contemporary language and its complexities of inwardness; out of the sticks, where I lived, to wander some mythic nightscape.
B000002UAO|5.0|Although The Beatles were very successful before, this album is where they really took off as a band that were willing to do something completely different from anything that had came before them. <br /> <br />The album starts off with the fairly ordinary number Drive My Car, before the siatr kicks in on Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown). This is where it starts getting very unusual. Norwegian Wood is a great song and the use of the sitar was something that no one had ever heard before. It works great, and the song sets the path for the rest of the album. John is probably the main man on this album with Nowhere Man, Girl, In My Life, and Run For Your Life all being incredible highlights. Nowhere Man is a great song with some nice guitar work, and In My Life always brings a tear to my eye whenever I hear it. <br /> <br />Of course, it's not just John's show as Paul contributes some great numbers as well. You Won't See Me and I'm Looking Through You, both about his relationship and breakup with Jane Asher, are great numbers and definitely get your foot tapping away when you hear them. Paul also contributes the sweet song Michelle, which pretty much cemented his status as the cute, loving Beatle.  <br /> <br />George has two songs on this album, If I Needed Someone being one of them, and I think it's a really good one. He was really starting to improve his writing and he would add a couple of excellent songs to The Beatles' next album, Revolver. <br /> <br />Rubber Soul was really the first album where the public saw that The Beatles were a band who were ready to try different things. This album has quite a few masterpieces, and is really worth picking up, along with The White Album and Abbey Road, if you want to see what all the fuss about The Beatles is.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I rarely say this about anything. . .but. . .<br /><br />O M F G!<br /><br />Superb.  Buy this album! Its worth the 24min Title Track alone.
B000002UAU|5.0|Perhaps one of the most discussed albums of all time, and priviledged with almost 1000 reviews here on Amazon, you wonder what more can be said about this album. I'm not going try to add anything new, except that I love this album. The Beatles were the best band of all time, no doubt about it, and when this album came out, it was something that no one had ever heard before. Everything was different from it's faus live structure, to the sitars on Within You, Without You (although The Beatles had previously used sitars on Norwegian Wood, and The Rolling Stones had used one on Paint It Black), to the amazing five minutes that end the album... the song known as Day In The Life. This is a song that I could talk about for hours. It's a wonderfully structured, starting with John's haunting voice, then moving into a large orchestra, then Paul's slightly more upbeat section, and then end with THAT piano chord. It's a song of a quality that had not been acheived to that point, and is rarely acheived anymore. <br /> <br />Of course, that's not the only song on this album, as there is many more. I've always enjoyed With A Little Help From My Friends, mainly because I've always enjoyed Ringo's vocals, and it's a catchy tune. Of course, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is one of John's greatest Beatles songs, as is Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite. The rest of the songs can be hit or miss. Getting Better is listenable but hardly a classic, same for Fixing A Hole. I do enjoy She's Leaving Home and the catchiness of Lovely Rita, and I think Good Morning, Good Morning is a nice number. <br /> <br />I could talk about this album for a while but there's not much more to say. Is it The Beatles' best album? No, personally, I think it would be either The White Album or Abbey Road, but Sgt. Pepper is much better than the majority of albums that were coming out at that time. I highly recommend it.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I thought Infinity was gonna be their worst recording.Now I'm not so sure.At least it had a couple of good songs. This has none. No guitar solos, no progressive hooks and even James doesn't sound as good as before. These guys are clearly out of ideas. And then the lyrics... Sacrificed Sons is just pure s**t. It would be a decent tune if it had good lyrics. Nobody wants to hear this stuff anymore. Stop whining about what happened years ago. GET OVER IT !!! And isn't James Canadian ??? Weird...
B000002UAI|4.0|Beatles For Sale is an album that seems to be rarely talked about amongst the Beatles community. A lot of people think it was rushed out, and that the boys were very tired from touring, both of which may be true, but it has several rewarding aspects. <br /> <br />Perhaps most interesting are the first two numbers, No Reply and I'm A Loser, both of which are John's songs. They have a very Dylan-esque feel to them that John would later perfect with You've Got To Hide Your Love Away on the Help album. They're both very memorable songs that people rarely talk about anymore.  <br /> <br />Also of interest is Paul's number I'll Follow The Sun which is a very catchy, bright little number. It has the same feel of Yesterday, which would debut in the next album. This album has several cover versions, which is a slight disappointment since The Beatles' previous album A Hard Day's Night had been their first full album of all original songs. Still, Paul's cover of Kansas City is a nice piece of old fashioned rock and roll, as is the song titled, suitably enough, Rock & Roll Music. Another good song is Eight Days A Week which was also a single.  <br /> <br />Overall, it's a good album but maybe not essential if you're not a hardcore Beatles fan. Still, it offers several good songs, so borrow a copy first and then decide if you want to buy.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This CD completely blew me away. I have over 300 CDS and hearing this I knew I absolutely had to write a review. This is one of those CDS everyone must own. I absolutely love radiohead's OK Computer, but I knew that was more a CD that certain people like.  <br /> <br />          I was expecting at least a couple of songs that I would skip through on the second listen, but each song is like their best song. I never thought it would be possible for any cd to be better than Parachutes, but I found a new favorite cd upon listening to the first few tracks of X&Y. You are able to tell that they put a huge amount of effort into every second of this album.  <br /> <br />      Some of the songs start out going slow, then it really drags you into it, and you will find your body covered in goosebumps. It is just one of those cds you can listen to whenever. No matter what emotion you find yourself, listening to this cd will always sound great. <br /> <br />     I always seem to get lost in every song, and it is as if I am watching them perform in the sky at night for some reason. If you like Coldplay, then don't think twice about getting this CD. I guarantee you will love it, and I am not just saying that because I really like Coldplay. Even if you don't really know much about the band, you will still love it. My brother had never heard them before, and while I was playing it, he too was blown away. <br /> <br />    Here is a short analysis of each song..... <br /> <br />1. Square One - This song starts out slow (i'm not saying that is a bad thing), then about one minute in it really starts getting into it, and really drags you in.....the ending to this song i can't describe...for some reason the ending is my favorite part, if you listen to it, then maybe you will understand why. It is a slower part of the song, and the best ending to any song I have ever heard. <br />2. What If - Another top song off the cd. Very well composed, and once again another song that makes you a part of it. <br />3. White Shadows - Very catchy....I always find myself singing this one. It always builds up to the chorus (my favorite part of the song) even when it feels as if it is in the best part of the song already. <br />4. Fix You - Heard them play this on Saturday Night Live, and thought it was pretty good, but i could think of much better songs by them....but then when I listened to it on the CD I  was blown away. <br />5. Talk - Great song...especially the guitar riffs. <br />6. X&Y - This song reminds me of something, but I don't know what it is. This would be really great on a soundtrack. The song has great guitar riffs. It also really builds as it progresses. <br />7. Speed of Sound - I was actually surprised the band decided to release this song first....It is definitely a really great song, but there were a couple there were a few I was surprised they didn't pick. The music video to this song was good. <br />8. A Message - This song starts out acoustic, but as it progresses, more and more starts to come in. <br />9. Low - Great intro, and the song only gets better as it goes along. <br />10. The Hardest Part - Another top song off of the CD. Very well composed...another song that would go great on a soundtrack <br />11. Swallowed in the Sea - Another very catchy song. The song is similar to \\"Fix You\\" in a way. <br />12. Twisted Logic - Of course another great song. Reminded me of \\"In My Place\\" probably because of the drumming. <br />13. Kingdom Come - Bonus Track on the CD, It is an acoustic song, and a very good one. It is my least favorite on the cd, but it is still really good. <br /> <br />          I can not stress enough how important for everyone to buy this CD. It isn't one of those situations where I am being selfish, and I am one of the few that likes it, but feels the need to make everyone else listen to it. It is a situation where I know you will love it. The only person I found that doesn't like it a friend of mine named Juan, but he only listens to rap music, and feels that any other type of music is garbage. Just make sure you purchase it right now, and if it was me I would pay at least $200 for this cd, if it was the only way i could listen to it, so $13 is a great price. This album really touched me, and I feel it is something that every music listener should own. <br />
B0009VRHLK|5.0|Almost a year after its US launch, The Brown Bunny will finally be released on DVD!  <br /> <br />For those that don't know the story - Gallo plays Bud Clay, a Motorcycle racer who travels across the country  <br />to his next race and to find his one true love, Daisy. On the way he meets women that share the same pain that he has. When he finally arrives in California we get to witness some of the best film making (not talking about the explicit oral scene for which this movie is famous for)in American Cinema History.    <br /> <br />Vincent Gallo's \\"Brown Bunny\\" is one of those films that is heavily bashed during its opening and then 5-10 years later is looked back on as a masterpiece.    <br /> <br />The Brown Bunny was said to be \\"the worst film in the history of the Cannes Film Festival\\", by Roger Ebert. But then after it's release in the states and after Roger Ebert interviewed Vincent Gallo, He gave it a 3 out of 4 stars.   <br /> <br />The problem is that the press hates Vincent Gallo, they think he is conceded and obnoxious and a jerk, but after they meet him and sit down for a one-on-one interview they find out that he is one of the smartest and coolest people on earth.  <br /> <br />His first indie breakthrough film \\"Buffalo '66 was also  bashed at the cannes Film Festival and then later labeled as \\"the best independent film of the last 10 years.\\" <br /> <br />I really hope that Vincent Gallo continues his career in Directing because he really is a genius and there is no one else in this world like him. <br /> <br />I also hope that this DVD includes the full unedited version(with commentary) that was shown at Cannes because I have yet to see that version.
B000069CWE|4.0|First I've got to say, this is not as good as Hybrid Theory. I do like a couple better (Pts. Of. Athrty with the new opening, and KRWLNG) but the others just can't compare to the originals. The titles like Riff Raff, Stef, Chali and a few others are just a bunch of phone calls and dumb stuff, but thank God they're only about 10 seconds long. It is a nice change once in a while after you've listened to Hybrid Theory a bunch of times. So if you're an LP fan that liked Hybrid Theory, then pick this one up. If you didn't like Hybrid Theory well...then you're not an LP fan so don't buy it. This is definitely more of a rap album, there isn't much rock here.      Oh, the cover art is pretty cool if you like that kind of stuff.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Believe it or not at one point in time I actually hated this band...no joke! Coldplay can now proudly say that they have officially conquered the music world. With tickets being sold for almost a grand to see their shows...I would agree. Coldplay returns after an almost 4 year hiatus from their grammy winning sophomore release only to return with something even better. `X&Y' is the same old Coldplay from a mood standpoint. Meloncholly tunes that are fun to relax to, but this time Coldplay really tried to experiment with new sounds. Coldplay uses the neo-new wave sound through the uses of keyboard effects on songs like `Square One and the self titled track, probably to throw in the science theme. There are also familiar  sounds featured in the hit single `Speed of Sound' and `Fix You' Then what makes this album really special is new song themes and tunes that make people listen and say...\\"Wait...that was Coldplay?\\" Songs such as those are. `A Message' and my favorite from the album `Swallowed In The Sea.' `X&Y' is all there was to be expected from this now super group and I am hoping that they will keep finding new ways to continue pleasing their fans. Being compared to bands like U2...I am sure they are hoping the same.
B000002JNN|5.0|Thunderstruck- probably the best opener to any cd ever. Also there's the classic party song Are You Ready. Moneytalks is another awesome one, this cd is almost flawless. The only one I might take off would be Mistress For Christmas. Towards the end it does get a little long, I would recommend putting it on shuffle mode. I listen to it like that most of the time. Add this to your cart you will not be disappointed. I would highly recommend this to people who like the live album (they sound a lot alike because they werereleased around the same time).
B000003KMG|5.0|This was the first music video I ever got and it is a very unique video. It grows on you the more you watch it, and its far from a typical video.  Anyone I show this to, they all tend to love &quot;I still haven't found what i 'm looking for&quot; where U2 sings in a small church where the choir joins in, it's amazing!<BR>Anyone that really enjoys u2's music, really should check this out!
B00004LN16|3.0|It takes a while to get used to. At first all the songs sounded the same to me, a little bit like St. Anger when I first listened to that. But if you give it a chance it will grow on you...eventually. It did take me a while to like it. This cd is proof, in my opinion, that AC/DC is running out of ideas. I hope I'm wrong, but none of these songs are good enough to be made into singles. Except maybe the title track. BOTTOM LINE: A very average cd with a bunch of average, not bad, songs. I prefer their older stuff. Only for hard core AC/DC fans.
B00081MUY0|5.0|this is the remastering we've always hoped for (not the royal \\"we\\" but the millions to whom this recording is elemental). thank you thank you thank you to Donovan and all involved in this superb remastering! <br />and oh! the extra cuts (you can't get this soon enough). in the past i'd sought and found white label promo first pressings (vinyl) of Sunshine Superman in search of the sound quality I longed for. never thought i'd say it about digital 16 bit vs analog but THIS IS IT!!! This is the pressing of this to own. Trust me on this one...
B000002JS0|5.0|T.N.T., one of the best AC/DC songs ever, and on this cd, is great. I would buy this cd for that song alone. AND ALL OF THEM ARE GOOD!!!!!!! It's a Long Way to the Top is great. Awesome cd maybe the best one with Bon Scott. Title track is amazing. Not much else to say. YOU WON\\"T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Outstanding, possibly their best yet.  Great orchestration, *very* different sounds and styles. Check out the Muse like sections on tracks 5 and 6, the Rush opening on track 5, the Pink Floyd openings on almost all the other tracks, then finish with Yes (well, Chris Squire), Genesis all the greats with DT's very own signature changes and sounds to make for a very original &quot;tribute&quot; album.  Oh yes, stunning chops too!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I was not a huge fan of coldplay when they first came out with yellow. I still don't like that song to this day but Their second albulm \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" became an instant favorite of mine and I feel this albulm is going to make my cd player tired. I find it to have a different and eclectic sound. It's a refreshing sound to hear after a lot of the hip hop driven music that has hit the radios in the past years. Coldplay is definitely and artsy band with lyrics that most people can relate to. A definite buy for the true musician. (I can't wait to try some of the stuff on piano and guitar!) =)
0316172324|3.0|This book is nothing more (or less) than an intriguing and entertaining collection of anecdotes.  Gladwell presents these as examples of how a finely tuned unconscious can make near-instantaneous decisions that are superior to the results of extensive information-gathering and analysis.  Unfortunately, nothing of any substance is offered in the way of how to train your mind to \\"thin-slice\\" or how and when to trust it (Gladwell points out that the unconscious can also be disastrously wrong).  Perhaps the author has left that for his next best-seller?
B00008S2VG|4.0|I have revisited Madge's much-maligned 2003 album \\"American Life\\" and I actually think it's pretty good...not at all as bad as people made it out to be when it was originally released. A couple of things may have factored in this: obviously, the title track, which I love, was a risky song to release as a first single, but heck, she was really the only artist at that point in time making her opinion heard of the Iraq war and the situation in the U.S. loud and clear...the American public took offense (surprise) and the song and album did not fare very well. The best version of the song, however, is the Oakenfold remix, which should have been the single (and they should have taken out that awful rap)...speaking of rap, Madonna's rapping on this album is dismal and also influenced the negative reviews, but she only does it a few times. The album's poorly chosen second single \\"Hollywood\\" holds the dubious distinction of being Madge's first single to fail to crack the U.S. Hot 100, and truly is one of Madonna's most tepid, uninspired and unoriginal songs, and probably aided in the album's tanking. Whoever thought of releasing that song as a second single should be fired. Same with the double sided \\"Nothing Fails\\"/\\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" which also failed to chart. The fourth single released from this album, \\"Love Profusion,\\" should have been the second, and it might have kept the album afloat in the U.S. Either way, \\"Love Profusion\\" had a great video and was a major hit internationally, especially in Spain, where it went to number one. Another lovely song that could have been a single was \\"Intervention.\\" Had they selected better songs as singles, this album may have fared differently. All in all, it makes for a good listen.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|i want to give this 3.5 stars, but i gave it 4 because avenged sevenfold is an awsome band. <br />i knew this cd wouldnt have as much screaming(which they are very good at) as waking the fallen, but i thought there might be some.  there isnt.  thats disapointing. <br />its also the only drawback to this cd.  its good once you get used to it.
