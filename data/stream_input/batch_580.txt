0312323867|3.0|I don't love it.  I liked the first one better.  This one is hard to believe.  Both books are just time killers (light reading, no brainer).  But you have to read both because it's a series.  It's just you have a hard time accepting the fact that a character like that who lived the life of Darcy Rhone for 30 years suddenly changes like that?  I know motherhood changes you but it's a bit radical.   <br />   <br />I figure you have several types of books, one to educate you (textbook) one to just kill time/entertain, but it's very hard to spritually enlighten, educate you and entertain at the same time.  I knew going in, it wasn't the last category but it didn't really entertain me too much either.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|in 2005, i had to say my favorite movies were Brokeback Mountain, Crash, and this film Walk the Line. i was slightly dissapointed that it wasent nominated for best picture but at least Witherspoon got a well deserved oscar, otherwise i would be PO'd. the film, like last years Ray, tells the story of another music legend. this time, Johnny Cash. we see his upbringings from childhood, to the time he enrolled in the army, marrys his girlfriend, and then that day he walks into that studio and earns himself a spot on the label. then the film focueses on his love for June Carter and it then plays on out like a Johnny Cash song. i thought the performences were exceptional from Pheonix playing the rugged Cash and Witherspoon, wow has she grown. its hard to belive this is the same girl who played the 'dumb blond' Elle Woods in the legally blonde series. her performence definently deserved that oscar and i'm proud of her. so, see the movie thats on my top 10 list and you'll be blown away.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Awesome...simply awesome!! <br />I got this cd last week when my friend from Bangalore (India) sent me as she knew that i am a great fan of Celine and as i live in a small town, i don't get international music here. <br />The first time i listened to this cd, it left me astonished. Even though this is not Christmas now, the cd brought December in March.As a 19 yr old, i love listening to a variety of music ( Imagine me listening to Celine Dion ) but i happen to like this cd a lot along with other Celine Dion albums except The Collector's Series (i feel that cd is incomplete). <br />The songs r superb here especially Adeste Fidelis, Another Year Has Gone By, The Magic of Christmas Day, The Prayer and Happy X'mas...( I am sure John Lenon is pretty proud of Celine for doing his song proud ). <br />The title track is good too(Even Christina did a cover of this song). <br />Well, this cd has just been declared 5X platinum being the second best selling Christmas album in the US....Really not very surprising after u give this cd a spin and worldwide sales is over 16 million...GREAT...GREAT....GREAT. <br />Keep it up Celine. Go get it people, buy it for yourself, gift it to your loved ones and everybody else.This will be the best Christmas gift ever to someone by you.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a great adaptation of a classical standard. We truly enjoyed the movie.
B000E5N62U|5.0|For us Steely Dan fans, Donald Fagen's third solo album was a long time coming.  Was it worth the wait? No question about it.  The music is classic Fagen, with songs that could have been on albums all the way back to the 70s.  <br /> <br />Listen to \\"The Great Pagoda of Funn\\" or \\"The Night Belongs to Mona\\" and tell me they could not have been on a Dan album (perhaps the underrated Gaucho).  And that's not a bad thing--the songs have a timeless quality within the Dan/Fagen oeuvre.   <br /> <br />A good Dan/Fagen album requires multiple listens, as one can not catch all the nuances of the song the first time around.  Morph the Cat qualifies.  The chords used in the album are unusual but gorgeous.  The excellent sound quality gives one the job of turning up the speakers to catch all of the elements of the songs. For example, I thought my CD was skipping while listening to \\"What I Do,\\" but instead it was a syncopated beat.  Very cool, Donald.  <br /> <br />I love the length of the songs.  It's a Dan trademark from the days of Aja, kept in Two Against Nature, but lost by Everything Must Go.  Morph the Cat's songs are long, thankfully.  One doesn't feel shortchanged like for EMG.  <br /> <br />The album is a true winner, listenable repeatedly.  The only weak track (if any) is the title track.  Personally, I think the song is a weak way to start and end the album, considering the incredibly deep tracks that surround the album.   <br /> <br />Here's hoping that the next Dan/Fagen album will not be a long wait away.  Thanks Donald, this album is fantastic!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is currently my favorite female voice and is undoubtably worthy of the honor.  She is able to blend a style uniquely her own and executed with such passion, that these songs have the power to arouse you from the deepest recesses of your being.  Her voice is reminiscent of Janis Joplin yet with the rough edges smoothed down to a sensual softness.  Once you close your eyes and listen fully you won't be able to help being enraptured yourself by her passionate expession.

B000002V07|5.0|Mazzy Star is so unique it is hard to describe her talent. A little throaty, a little ethereal - she is incredibly talented. This is a perfect CD for just chilling - especially good for relaxation.
0321344758|5.0|A simple and direct book, with much fun and excellent examples, prominence for the illustrations of the book that speak by itself. The author was very happy in the approach, isn't a book for consultations, is a book to read one or two times to understand the message and apply in all of your projects. <br /> <br />Is an excellent book, of fast and easy reading. Moreover, the author places all of points with great knowledge of cause and demonstrates that the obvious not always is so obvious. <br /> <br />An excellent introduction to usability in web, shows how to realize usability tests and how to deal with situations where you is forced to make what you knows that's wrong.

B000002MIY|5.0|Living to love this Donald Fagen masterpiece is not difficult. I had misplaced this audio cd years ago only to repurchase it, and to take me back ,seems like months, but, years. a must have. that's why i have.
B000E97HIA|4.0|Having been a Prince fan since early high school this album is a welcome relief.It has dance music slow music and songs that stand out.The first being 3121 a kinda of a mix of different styles then jumps into Lolita.This has a nice variety from fast to slow and it goes back in forth.My personal favorite was the Dance Imean with a lyric such as don't wanna give u my love cause i don't wanna lose my mind,don't wannagive you my love cause it will be a waste of time.The hippiest song Get on the Boat is a nice way to end this album.It has 12 tracks but its almost like Prince could of continued but chose to end.That to me is ok because it makes me wanna hear his next effort.I also heard that he signed albums and performed in California.That is cool not too many artist will do that....Thank God he cares about his fans!
B00009P1OD|4.0|For those of you familiar with the phrases 8-track tape, vinyl record, and cassette tape, this 5.1 surround sound mix is finally the way one of Chicago's best efforts was meant to be heard.  The clarity and separation between the instruments and voices is like hearing it for the first time again. Although this isn't the best 5.1 DVD-A in my collection, it is well worth the price for any Chicago fan.  Definitive good sounds from one of the best jazz/rock acts of all time.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This is one of their best.  The version of Robert Johnson's \\"Love in Vain\\" on this album shows you that Jagger and Richards are not simply pop icons or rock stars, they are virtuoso musicians, transforming a relatively simple blues song into a whole new art form.
6305428042|4.0|Simple, good-sprited, Halloween fun.  Good ol' Disney!  There are a lot of silly plot elements which keep it from being a 5-star, but my kids really do like to watch it all year long.
B000E97HIA|4.0|It seems that a lot of Prince fans think that every new album is weak if it isn't as good as Sign of the Times.  Well, not to be unkind, but Prince is never going to make an album as good as Sign of the Times again.  His days of revolutionizing music are over.  However, his days of making good music are certainly not, if his last two releases are any indication.  Musicology was an immensely enjoyable, if safe, soul album.  With 3121, Prince goes in another direction (although just as safe) and gives us another very solid effort. <br /> <br />Laden with synthesizers, vocal effects and funky guitar licks, 3121 recalls the early 80s Prince sound that Musicology never even brushes up against.  Not that it sounds dated at all, in fact it is a very fresh recording (which probably says something about the music Prince was making 20 years ago...)  Thematically, we get what we're used to - and with song titles like \\"Black Sweat\\" and \\"Satisfied\\", I don't have to tell you what that is.  In addition, there is the quirky and excellent \\"The Word\\" which is Prince's standard spiritual musing (ala \\"The Cross\\" from SotT).  \\"Get on the Boat\\" is a goodwill party song with extended jams from Sheila E and Maceo Parker (sweet!), and \\"Fury\\" is a blazing rock track with Prince's tremendous guitar skills on full display.  Unfortunately, we also get another Prince staple, the commercial for his latest female protg, \\"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed\\".  The tepid ballad \\"Te Amo Corazon\\" doesn't add anything either.  Still, as a whole, the album is a good listen throughout. <br /> <br />3121 doesn't really dazzle you with experimentation or groundbreaking material.  What makes it so appealing is that Prince is such a pro, the album comes off effortless but far from careless.  Songs like \\"The Word\\" and \\"The Dance\\" are meticulously crafted with multiple layers of instrumentation and subtle changes, but don't suffer from pretentiousness or over-production.  The heart of the songs are augmented by thearrangements, not clouded by them. <br /> <br />On the opening, title track Prince invites you to the party.  If you have an open mind, I promise that you'll have a good time.  Just don't be the guy that complains that you went to a better party last year. <br />
B00006LLNU|5.0|\\"( ),\\" the third album by Sigur Rós, was my introduction to this band from Iceland and it is nothing short of stunning.  I have never heard music so powerful and beautiful at the same time.  I have been listening to this band for less than a year and they have quickly become one of the artists I listen to the most.     My recommendation for those considering this album is to find a way to listen to \\"Popplagið,\\" the untitled 8th track.  The climax in this song is possibly the most awe-inspiring and gripping ever.  Like I said in the title of this review, words do not do it justice.  The same can be said for the rest of this disc.
0679422714|1.0|I wonder whether the writers know how to write in an objective way. They ignored or delibrately chose to neglect facts that did not support their views, and only mentioned facts consistent with their views. They first set up a theory, \\"Mao is evil, ruthless, bad, bad and bad.\\" Then they tried to attribute the facts listed in the book to this evil nature of Mao. This is so judgemental, not an objective way to represent history.
B00025ETIW|3.0|maybe i was just expecting too much as they won band of the year by spin readers, but it's just not that good. this is similar to many other new punk bands and musically isn't particularly inventive or inspiring.  this is definitely not emo, nor does it really have \\"metal guitar riffs\\" as a review suggested. it's not bad, i could listen to it as background, but is it great - not even close in my opinion.  most reviews tend to be by people who love the band or the album and want to share their enthusiasm and interest (i'm guilty of that for several albums).  this was one i was curious about with all the raves about it and it just didn't impress me much.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|With all the renewed interest in Jane Austin period pieces due to the recent release of Pride and Prejudice (Kiera Knightly) - folks should really check out this beautiful star-crossed love story.  Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root are absolutely fabulous!  I just never wanted it to end!
B00005JMEW|1.0|The whole Kill Bill is one of the dullest, most pointless exercises in celluloid that I have ever witnessed.  While Volume One is decent, it is hardly anything amazing. The 2 Kill Bill movies could have easily been edited down to a 2 1/2 hour running time, but Tarantino decided to make one of the grandest exercises in self indulgence I have ever seen.  Scenes from Volume Two should have been edited in as quick flashbacks in Volume One, but instead we got long, completely worthless expository scenes that served no real purporse other than Tarantino wanted to put them into his film because, he's Tarantino.  Even if Quentin had cut the film down to 2 1/2 hours, it would have been an average film at best.  It certainly would have been better than the 4 hours of indulgent swill we had to endure (I watched the entire 4 hours in one sitting...big mistake).  Critics gushed all over this film, claiming it was full of real emotion, and that Quentin had matured as a filmmaker. They couldn't be more wrong. This is a film by a man who knows about movies, but not about real life. Tarantino grew up watching crappy Kung Fu films, sleazy European trash films, and bad Jack Hill films. And the influence of them permeates his work. If you need to watch a 4 hour film, Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, or Once Upon a Time in America are available. One frame from any of these films is superior to Kill Bill....
630587493X|5.0|This movie displays Robin Williams'virtuosity as an actor. Probably the best movie he has made. Funny to sad.  Get your hankies out at the end. Beautifully photographed; fine special effects; wonderful costuming; fine actors.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I have to admit, i probably would have never heard of these guys if it werent for the movie Vanilla Sky.  It features song #4 in probably the most beautiful and stunning scene in recent cinema.  That is why i got the cd.  However, the entire cd is incrediblely melodic, relaxing, and soothing.  THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD.  also, watch the last scene in Vanilla Sky.  That will convince you to buy the cd because of the amazing song.
B00005JMUA|1.0|The whole Kill Bill film is one of the dullest, most pointless exercises in celluloid that I have ever witnessed.  While volume one was decent, volume two scenes drag on and on. The 2 Kill Bill movies could have easily been edited down to a 2 1/2 hour running time, but Tarantino decided to make one of the grandest exercises in self indulgence I have ever seen.  Volume two plays like an outtake/deleted scene featurette on a DVD.  Most of the scenes are useless, and they go way too long.  Critics gushed all over this, claiming it was full of real emotion, and that Quentin had matured as a filmmaker. They couldn't be more wrong. This is a film by a man who knows about movies, but not about real life. Tarantino grew up watching crappy Kung Fu films, sleazy European trash films, and bad Jack Hill films.

0767817486|1.0|The plot is set in Turkey, but the producers and director refuse to repudiate their West-trumps-all mindsets. Turkish people are portrayed as fat, greedy, and ugly, yet people from Western countries are shown as victims of a horrendous justice system. This movie is more than a Hollywood film full of harmless misconceptions; it is an outright attack on all countries that are deemed \\"backwards\\" by pretentious Westerners.    Here is a quick way to figure out if you should watch this movie-       ---> If you know the Arizona immigration laws are racist, China has cities with skyscrapers, and Georgia is a European country, then feel free to watch, as you won't get brainwashed. Do so at your own risk though, because I guarantee you will feel the urge to shoot someone within the first ten minutes. Good thing the Constitution lets us Americans own guns!        ---> If you think the Arizona immigration laws are necessary to the well-being of the United States of America, China is full of men with braids, and Georgia is the state that grows delicious peaches, then you're in luck, this movie has all your values! Just remember not to watch it.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Someone must have gifted Madonna from birth, because honestly, love her or hate her, who has done more? 2,000 years from now when people are studying our culture, Madonna will be listed- she is an icon. And personally, I have had her album on my MP3 player for like, three months now, and it is addictive. Her lyrics on this are classic Madonna with a sense of maturity. I feel righteous dancing to this. I personally think it is highly adventurous to keep picking up styles and turning them into your very own flavor- it is incredible to me. Keep on keepin on, Madonna-
1567184855|4.0|There is so little correct understanding of the soul in its spirit body beyond this dimension of earth reality.  Michael Newton, in his books JOURNEY OF SOULS and DESTINY OF SOULS, comes the closest to describing what I have known to be the reality for the soul and spirit on the other side of this earth dimension.  There are elements that he is still missing and not understanding, but it would be difficult to have the full overview while still maintaining a human body or unless your spirit was very evolved. I have yet to come across another author that has unraveled as much as he has with all his case studies.  Sometime his explanations, because of the manner of his wording are a little confusing, but over all he gets his point across.  On this topic, as an author, I would say he is leading the pack.  I appreciate all his hard work and efforts.  His books offer a rare education. <br />Sheilan ([...] <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I was so into watching Buffy and Angel I did not give Firefly the fair chance it so richly deserves.  After the show was cancelled, I ended up buying the show on DVD as a package deal on Amazon (yay, Amazon!) just because \\"Joss did it so it's gotta be good, right?\\"  Well, the show was amazing, and the movie is incredible.   <br /> <br />Not often can you recruit other nerds to your cause, but this movie made it easy.  It's got all the elements, romance, danger, horror, drama, comedy... and it all works.   <br /> <br />This isn't just a movie you watch and forget about.  It opens up a whole door for people to find out about a little show called Firefly, and a GOD among men, Joss Whedon.   <br /> <br />Great dialogue, characters you fall in love with, and twisty plot lines.. who could ask for more?
0380789035|2.0|I love unique and quirky and often like a lot of stories with a science fiction or fantasy slant.  I had high hopes for American Gods but came away disappointed, and I'm perplexed at how much other people enjoyed it.  I struggled through many of the sections and ended up just skimming through the end until the final chapter ... and I don't think I missed much.  There were elements I found interesting and one or two developments I found surprising, but character development was lacking and I found a lot of the narrative simply exhausting.<br /><br />The only other thing I had read of Gaiman's was Coraline, which I did like.  Maybe some day I'll give Neverwhere a try, but not until I've read something else more rewarding in the interim.
B0009X7664|5.0|Gregory Peck did a superb job of portraying Atticus Finch and inspires us all to our better selves.  No wonder he had a fondness for his role.  Atticus Finch is a man for all times, a man of integrity who makes us believe we could all be better than we are, in our professional lives as well as in our personal relationships.  He is believeable. <br />I thought the three children did great acting jobs as well nor did they eclipse Mr. Peck. <br />Everyone would benefit from viewing this movie not only once but periodically, for another dose of inspiration plus it is very entertaining and comical in places.  It is relate-able as well as inspirational. <br />Superb movie!
0375758992|5.0|This book left me feeling much the same as I felt after reading Angela's Ashes. <br /> <br />To say that it is a wonderful, powerful and sometimes very funny account of growing up in Rhodesia, which it is, does not address how terribly sad and deprived this woman's childhood was. <br /> <br />Ms. Fullers childhood was full of dirt and disorder, alcohol, death and racial tension.  That she was able to grow up to write about it so beautifully and not to have lost the humor it provided is nothing short of amazing. <br /> <br />Just as in Angela's ashes, you will not like the parents.  Put that aside and enjoy the book.
B0002XDODU|4.0|First off if you're just into Rammstein's fast and heavy riffs then this album most likely won't appeal to you because they have slowed down a bit on this cd. This does cause a bit of a problem because the cd doesn't go up and down like their earlier work so it just kindda stays in the middle most of the time. Now that doesn't mean the songs are bad in fact I pretty much like the whole album. The song Reise Reise has an organ in it which gives it a sea chanty feeling. Mein Teil isn't that fast but it's heavy and the singer goes for a different vocal style than usual. Los features an acoustic guitar and a harmonica which gives it a nice bluesy feel, Amerika has a nice poppy feel to it and some lyrics are in English, Moskau also has a poppy feel to it and it also has the organ there are also some female vocals singing in Russian. Ohne dich is one of their best ballads about loneliness ever. The other songs are also good but I don't want to chew you're ear off that much. So if you're a fan of good music , no matter what kind, you should get this cd. Hey my mom even likes these guys after all and she's not into this type of music.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great fun!  Who knew that an action western/science fiction series with a sense of humor could be so entertaining?  A must have!
B000003RCY|5.0|First off my cd cover is different, it only shows their heads and the rest is all white. I think that cover looks better but either way it's the same cd whichever cover you get. This is their first cd and it's the most raw and fast paced album that they've made. Wollt ihr.. is their best riff ever but the song goes on about a minute too long. Asche zu Asche has a great fast paced riff but it's not as heavy as I'd like but it still rocks. Seemann is a ballad that slows down the album but it does have some cool heavy sounding guitars thrown in it here and their. Things pick up again with Du riechst ... which is another fast paced fast song with a great riff and beat. Herzeleid is slower but still heavy and the singer says the lyrics a word or 2 at a time and it has a nice keyboard solo. Heirate mich has a mediocre riff but it still works very well. Das Alte Leid is the strangest song here, it doesn't sound like the rest of the songs but it's still good. Rammstein is also slow but heavy and it took me a while to like it but I do. The other songs I didn't mention are also faced paced and good. This cd also has their best guitar solo's, they have a nice warpy feel to them and yes the lyrics are in German, which give it a great sound plus the singer doesn't sound that good singing in English. So if you're a fan or like fast paced music then you should buy this cd.

B000E6GBV2|5.0|This is my favorite album of 2006 so far. I had only previously heard one Carissa's Weird album and it was just recently, but I loved it. I actually did not know this was half of that band until a week or so after I got the advance promo cd last month. It made sense. While not sounding just like Carissa's Weird, the songwriting and voice were there. I like this even better.  <br /> I am surprised that there are not more comparisons to My Morning Jacket. There are hints near the beggining, slighlty more in the middle and by track 8 and on till the end, they have almost become MMJ circa 2001. And that is NOT a bad thing. The Shins comparisons are also mostly warranted. So if you can't get enough Shins and MMJ in your music diet, you have found your new favorite band... for this month.
0596007124|5.0|I really enjoy reading this book. Having never taken an object oriented design class, I didn't know how to use the language to my advantage. Even the first chapter got my brain thinking, and was able to clean up some of my old code to be reusable and easily modifiable. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. It is easy to get into and easy to understand. Even though I don't program in Java, I was able to understand all of the syntax, so even if you use Flash or C++, many of the examples they provide will be useful to you, and easily adaptable.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya, being one of my favourite singers, did with this album an indeed wonderhull job. I am glad I bought it. Over one hour of listening pleasure and a voice so clear that one dreams away untill long afterwards.
B000E5N62U|4.0|I am a life long fan of steely dan/ Donald Fagen. I dont know of any other artist with such broad appeal. He and Walter Becker are true musical craftsman. I wish all recording artists cared about their work as much as they do.  <br />  Morph the cat is growing on me the more I listen to it. It has awesome arrangements and some very catchey melodies. Mr Fagen does his usual trick of writing somewhat criptic lyrics but you gotta love it. <br />  There are only 8 tracks on the disc (not counting the reprise) and some seem to go on a little long but that is better than 12 shorter songs with lots of filler.  <br />  I would definitly recomend this disc to anyone who is fimiliar with sd/df. You wont be disappointed (unless you want to be) <br />
B000E97HIA|3.0|Hi. I am a PRN fan from 1980. When I purchased this LP on CD. I must confess, I was really looking for some of the songs to be more stand out and then have some of the songs be... well Prince type songs you know funky but weird yet very good. I have owned every prince LP form For You to 3121 and I must say they have all been very good listens. But for this one I was really looking for him to put it on my hears and inspire me to want to be musician are just blast the music in my headphones late at night and jam out. But this LP kind of only had like one real jam out song. once again I am a PRN fan. I don't have anything bad to say because every song is well put together and has its own sound but I use to listen to Lovesexy all night and jam out and every PRN fan knows that lovesexy is not the most highly rated of PRN Lps so you all know that I am not speaking from hate. Track 5 is the only song that on first listen I liked.

B0000AUHPK|2.0|This is decidedly among the worst movies I have ever seen! It is completely incoherent and shallow. In my opinion the actors don't even come close to rendering the emotions of Heathcliffe (one wonders if he even has any...) and Kathy. I give it two stars ONLY because of the beautiful scenery provided by the moors.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|Finally!!! A Madonna album like she used to make 'em back in the day (sorry for dating myself!!). It makes u get up and dance which, quite frankly, is very refreshing being that she went through that whole, \\"these-are-my-political-views\\" period. I for one want my artists to entertain me, not to tell me their opinions...Great album
B00005JOE8|5.0|The truth is that this is a very good movie and has a good message. The problem is that this message can be taken very differently depending on your status. Are you a homosexual or an heterosexual, a republican, or a liberal, a communist, a black person or a white person, an inmigrant an anti-bush or a pro-bush or maybe a huge bush fanatic? <br /> <br />Basically, it tells us to fight for our ideals and not let the government opress the people they lead. <br /> <br />To some, this movie just might be a huge anti-bush political statement. Some might be bothered by the fact that the movie tells the story as a subplot of two gay persons. <br />Some might even say that this movie is saying that anarchy is the way. But these people forget that we are talking about how \\"this non-existent particular\\" government ran things. You know: the banning of certain songs, certain books, certain pieces of art, the curfew etc etc all in the name of protecting our dear citizens from \\"evil\\" points of view (whatever those might be). <br /> <br />Like with most movies that carry a message of this class, it is painstakingly disected to find the many controversial points that they can use against it to say that it truly is a horrible movie from the \\"cinematographic/entertainmen\\"t point of view (of course). Does anybody find this a little \\"odd\\" (I'm afraid to say wrong, cause some one in here might just find it insulting. For the love of God!) <br /> <br />Like I said, it really depends on your point of view. A man's terrorist can be another man's freedom fighter. Where do we draw the line?  <br /> <br />The bottom line is, this movie is really a good one. It has a great script and very good actors. (Some might disagree with me in this particular point, but what do I care.) It has some good lines, good action and a very emotional and political plot. The movie is thought provoking. Is about a government that sought to control the masses by fear. A governemt that controlled the influx of ideasand points of view that they considered \\"wrong\\". It's about a charecter who takes an approach to stop all of this and tries to make the people remember that they are the ones who decide in what ideal to believe in. That is all and the fact that some people view that as a twisted political statement against order, personally disgust me. <br />
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I am stunned by the volume of vicious reviews that this film received. In my opinion, there were only three films in 2005 that were worth repeat viewings; Serenity, Batman Begins, and this one. <br />I can only assume that there is a very active \\"Keanu-backlash\\" in effect. I found this movie to be interesting with great visuals. Perhaps other reviewers couldn't deal with a hero figure that is very different from what is usually portrayed on screen. This Constantine triumphs due to his wits and ability to manipulate others, very like his comic counterpart. <br />So, he's not blond or British, move on! If Keanu hadn't got involved, there wouldn't have been any Hellblazer movie, and the fanboys would have bitched about that!

B00005JO9J|5.0|Season I - is worth the money; however, the CD itself was defective and had to be returned.
B00013RC8O|5.0|one of the first chase movies i saw as a teenager and loved it. i never saw it again on tv or otherwise. to find it brought back good memories of the younger years. thanks for the memories. two thumbs up.
0060922583|4.0|Approximately the first half of the book is brilliant, introducing us to wonderful minds like Bohm.  The second half is, unfortunately, sullied with goofy guru stories presented in the same credible voice as used to describe quantum mechanics.  No matter, it is a riviting read, not to be missed.  The author died of leukemia in his 30's, unfortunately, but this is a significant legacy full of mind-expanding ideas which will lead you to read and learn more of reality and perception.
B000E33VWW|5.0|I just finished reading Clarke's biography on Capote a few weeks ago and watched the DVD last night.  It was excellent.  Performances, casting and filming were all top notch.  Clearly one of my top 5 favorite movies.  Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD, you will want to watch it with friends and family more than once.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman deserved the Oscar and I'm glad he won.  He is a true talent and shines way above other so called \\"actors\\" in today's movies.  He has a very bright future ahead of him if he keeps picking movies like this to do.
B00003CWPL|5.0|This film has been unavailable for so long and I am so ever grateful they finally released this on DVD.  I have heard so much about this cult classic but have never seen it.  The wait is finally over!  Watching a David Lynch film is an experience, this one in particular takes you into the deep chasm of a surrealistic netherworld.  Eraserhead truly is a bizarre and beautiful film.  My only regret is I was not of age when this movie was first released and shown on movie theatres,  it must have been quite a visual and aural experience watching this film unfold larger than life.  <br /> <br />Visual and audio transfers are excellent! The quality of the DVD is superb!  A worthy addition to your DVD movie library.
B00005JOE8|5.0|First of all, This movie was better than I thought it was gonna be. It's about governmental and political dictatorship. It shows how a government based on greed oppresses it's people by means of prejudice, invoking fear, censorship, and curfews. It gives you a look at how the media misinforms and misleads the people intentionally with false information. This movie is about a country needing one fearless leader, icon, or symbol willing to stand up and speak against these injustices. They get it in the form of a masked individual known simply as \\"V\\". \\"V\\" is all about starting a revolution to overthrow the government, so the people can take back their country and freedom without fear or reservations. Personally, I don't think this movie is pro-Bush or anti-Bush, but I do think it's left up to you to make the call, or interpret it as you will. All I know is, as far as entertainment value goes it was great. Natalie Portman was wonderful, and she still looked beautiful without hair. This movie gets..THUMBS UP!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just want to add my voice to all those in praise of Firefly and its creator, Joss Whedon. Firefly is what all television series should aspire to ... if the networks so allowed. From the beginning, it was obvious that the network execs didn't know what to do with this series, thus they completely bungled it and did a tremendous disservice to viewers.  <br />But this review is about the DVD set, which is excellent. The only problem with it is that when you finish watching the final episode, you want to scream, \\"MORE! I want more!\\" A profound sadness accompanies the realization that there are no more episodes, nor will there ever be.  <br />Oh, well, there's the movie Serenity, an excellent followup. We can dream of sequels. And we can watch the Firefly DVDs and hope that someday the network head enchiladas will get a clue and recognize the genius of Joss Whedon.
B000EGDC14|5.0|And a shining example of how to do electronic pop  the right way. Incredibly sexy but not vulgar. Instantly and ridiculously catchy, but not lightweight and throwaway. Completely accessible but with just enough edge. And all the better because it seems Goldfrapp are just begining to tap into their collaborative creativity. Alison's voice has never sounded better. Call me crazy, but I hear the timbre, pitch and phrasing of a young Olivia Newton John in Miss Goldfrapp's voice, and NO, that's not a bad thing; it is perhaps the highest compliment I can pay her. Supernature is by far the best album I've bought this year. By all means get the bonus pack with the DVD. The 5.1 Surround mix is incredible, and the extras are a real treat for longtime fans and newcomers alike. Forget Ladytron, forget Miss Kitten, forget Scissor Sisters, forget Fischerspooner. Goldfrapp ARE the future of electronic pop.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Very good, highly reccomended! My 5 year old daughter loves to listen in the car while we drive... if she's tired she wants \\"A Love That Never Grows Old,\\" if she's wanting to boogie she asks for \\"The Devil's Right Hand\\" & put it on repeat!! It is a highly evocative journey in music, reflecting the journey the movie took. All the acoustic pieces are heart-wrenching and beautiful. The vocal pieces, from Willie Nelson's version of the Bob Dylan song \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\" to Rufus Wainwright's haunting \\"The Maker Makes,\\" are just as amazing. A masterfully crafted CD. Gustavo Santaolalla & Bernie Taupin created songs so romantic and painful it's hard to describe the feelings they evoked in this 40 year old Lesbian mom. WOW. Buy this CD.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|As a lifelong fan of Pink Floyd and of David Gilmour in particular it is painfully obvious to me that this man really has nothing left to offer. Without a doubt, this music SOUNDS good. The production is crystal clear. The organic nature of the instrumentation is somewhat heartening and the guitar solos sometimes soar to lofty heights. But it doesn't hide the fact that it is lyrically empty ( Gilmour has never been a lyricist, and will freely admit to it, but surely his Floyd wealth could have gotten him a hired gun with more ideas and more creativity than his wife ) and ultimately nothing more than aural wallpaper. It is slight, lazy and slack, and it just isn't enough. I've searched in vain for standout lyrics or vocal phrases, for anything akin to excitement or energy, for any real hooks that make me say \\"wow, I want to hear that again!\\". And I just couldn't find it. Surely On an Island was not made to fulfill contractual obligations, or it wouldn't have taken so damn long to make. I say \\"make\\" and not \\"create\\" because it is all so rote, and by the numbers. This is without a doubt the weakest material Gilmour has ever recorded, and if this is truly the best he has to offer, then maybe that Floyd reunion we keep our fingers crossed for isn't such a good idea after all.
0399226907|5.0|This book is deservedly a classic for the littlies.  Great story and fabulous illustrations as you count along through the caterpillar's feast until his amazing transformation into a butterfly.  Most kids love the way the pages have been punched to show the caterpillar eating his way through his food.  Definitely worth adding to your kids' collection.

B00004Z4SD|2.0|I realize I'm taking a chance by writing this review.  The people that don't like this movie are a minority, and get lots of 'unhelpful review' marks.   <br /> <br />However, I can't recommend this movie.  The story behind this movie is touching and it drives the viewer to want to see the movie through.   <br /> <br />The problem is with the film itself.  The story is good, it's heartwarming, it provokes reflection... but the film is not and does not. <br /> <br />The acting in this film is embarrassing to watch at times.  The cheesiness of some of the dialogue is over-the-top.  The direction... I hate to say it, but it looks like a movie made for television, and for a Saturday afternoon at that.  The characters are mostly hollow (the deer-lady reminded me of the log-lady from earlier David Lynch work). <br /> <br />I started watching this movie and it had enough potential to make me follow it through, but at every turn it just got worse.   <br /> <br />Now, I'm not the type that is going to dismiss a movie because something doesn't blow up every 45 seconds... it's fine that this movie has a slow, deliberate pace.  However, what it lacks is meaningful character interation, irony, conflict, tension - anything to raise the interest level.  The closest thing we get to emotion is regret, and regret is hardly a plot-driver.  The two most interesting characters of the film are separated early on and rarely interact after that.  The rest of the character interaction is basically limited to saying nice things to each other followed by \\"good luck\\" \\"thanks for the help\\" \\"amen to that\\" \\"nice to meat you\\" kind of dialogue.   <br /> <br />There are some good scenes in the movie and the story behind it is compelling, so I give it two stars.
B00005JO9J|3.0|I absolutely LOVE this show for its drama and well-written plots. But as a nurse, I know that alot of its contents are not true. The best TV show but the worst show for portraiting nurses and other medical personnel. But with hot actors like Patrick Dempsey and Isiah Washington, who cares!
B000A6T1HC|2.0|After listening to this, I would not recommend it to the casual listener.  A very odd and certainly different vocal selections.  Still not one of my favorite singers.
1400032717|3.0|It took me a while to get into this book due to the nature of the narrative, but after I got used to it, it was entertaining.  What I didn't actually like, was the story itself.  It started out with great promise and ended somewhat disappointingly.  I wish the author would have stayed a little more focused with Christopher and not his divorced parents.  Now I realize that this was part of the story, but I lost interest because there really wasn't anything new said, except of course, who said it.
0895260131|1.0|Islam holds the world record for having THE MOST books published AGAINST it--but it is still the fastest growing religion in the world--especially among women. He wants to know how a young man could blow himself up a bus. Islam forbids that firstly. If only he had asked how a president could blow up a peaceful nation in Iraq. How does a president help the arch-killer of occupied Palestine? Why doesn't he ask where Hitler was brought up - Hitler,who murdered 50 million innocent people? Why doesn't he ask where the people who dropped two atom bombs on Japan were educated? Who killed three million innocent Vietnamese? Who annihilated the Indians? Who has maintained imperialism to this day? Who waged the Spanish civil war, which exacted a toll of 600,000 in 36 months? Why don't we ask these questions? Who has over 15,000 nuclear warheads - Muslims or the non-Muslims? The Muslims or the Americans? The Muslims or the Europeans?\\"  <br /> <br />he CLEARLY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ISLAMIC HISTORY--she should go learn about what the Christians did to the Jews and to the non-Christians living amonst them. I could site 1,000 atrocities. Not only that I could quote from the Bible, i.e: Jesus says in Luke 19:27 But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them-bring them here and kill them in front of me.\\" as just ONE example <br /> <br />Islam taught tolerance. There are about 20 million Arab COPTIC Christians who bear witness to this fact!!! The Jews loved the treatment they received from the Muslims--find out why, when Muslims were driven out of Spain by the Christians, the non-Muslims followed the Muslims and chose to live in their territory. WHEREEVER THE QURAN SAYS SOMETHING DEMEANING TO NONMUSLIMS--LOOK AT THE CONTEXT!!!! <br /> <br />Here's Dr. Zakir Naik's take--someone Spencer obviously didn't want to quote since he's an ignorant biased fool: <br /> <br />The best reply to the misconception that Islam was spread by the sword is given by the noted historian De Lacy O'Leary in the book \\"Islam at the cross road\\" (Page 8): <br />\\"History makes it clear however, that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping through the world and forcing Islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myth that historians have ever repeated.\\" <br />Muslims ruled Spain for about 800 years. The Muslims in Spain never used the sword to force the people to convert. Later the Christian Crusaders came to Spain and wiped out the Muslims. There was not a single Muslim in Spain who could openly give the adhan, that is the call for prayers. <br />Muslims were the lords of Arabia for 1400 years. For a few years the British ruled, and for a few years the French ruled. Overall, the Muslims ruled Arabia for 1400 years. Yet today, there are 14 million Arabs who are Coptic Christians i.e. Christians since generations. If the Muslims had used the sword there would not have been a single Arab who would have remained a Christian. <br />The Muslims ruled India for about a thousand years. If they wanted, they had the power of converting each and every non-Muslim of India to Islam. Today more than 80% of the population of India are non-Muslims. All these non-Muslim Indians are bearing witness today that Islam was not spread by the sword. <br />Indonesia is a country that has the maximum number of Muslims in the world. The majority of people in Malaysia are Muslims. I would love for Wafa to inform me as to \\"Which Muslim army went to Indonesia and Malaysia?\\" <br />Similarly, Islam has spread rapidly on the East Coast of Africa. One may again ask, if Islam was spread by the sword, \\"Which Muslim army went to the East Coast of Africa?\\" <br />The famous historian, Thomas Carlyle, in his book \\"Heroes and Hero worship\\", refers to this misconception about the spread of Islam: \\"The sword indeed, but where will you get your sword? Every new opinion, at its starting is precisely in a minority of one. In one man's head alone. Thereit dwells as yet. One man alone of the whole world believes it, there is one man against all men. That he takes a sword and try to propagate with that, will do little for him. You must get your sword! On the whole, a thing will propagate itself as it can.\\" <br />With which sword was Islam spread? Even if Muslims had it they could not use it to spread Islam because the Qur'an says in the following verse:  <br />\\"Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from error\\"[Al-Qur'an 2:256] <br />It is the sword of intellect. The sword that conquers the hearts and minds of people. The Qur'an says in Surah Nahl, chapter 16 verse 125: <br />\\"Invite (all) to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious.\\" [Al-Qur'an 16:125] <br /> <br />An article in Reader's Digest `Almanac', year book 1986, gave the statistics of the increase of percentage of the major religions of the world in half a century from 1934 to 1984. This article also appeared in `The Plain Truth' magazine. At the top was Islam, which increased by 235%, and Christianity had increased only by 47%. May one ask, which war took place in this century which converted millions of people to Islam? <br />Islam is without doubt the best religion but the media is in the hands of the westerners who are afraid of Islam. The media is continuously broadcasting and printing information against Islam. They either provide misinformation about Islam, misquote Islam or project a point out of proportion, if any.  <br />When any bomb blasts take place anywhere, the first people to be accused without proof are invariably the Muslims. This appears as headlines in the news. Later, when they find that non-Muslims were responsible, it appears as an insignificant news' item. If a 50 year old Muslim marries a 15 year old girl after taking her permission, it appears on the front page but when a 50 year old non-Muslim rapes a 6 year old girl, it may appear in the news in the inside pages as `Newsbriefs'. Everyday in America on an average 2,713 cases of rape take place but it doesn't appear in the news, since it has become a way of life for the Americans.  <br />I am aware that there are some Muslims who are dishonest, unreliable, who cheat, etc. but the media projects this as though only Muslims are involved in such activities. There are black sheep in every community. I know Muslims who are alcoholics and who can drink most of the non-Muslims under the table. <br />
B00005OCMR|5.0|It's impressive how a 20 year old movie explained what's everyday's life in the actual world <br />Disney's best movie
B000006TRV|5.0|I was super pleased the the remastering job done on this classic.  I have played it a number of times since recently receiving the order.  If you haven't replaced vinyl or original CD set with this one, I highly suggest that you do.  It is seamlessly clean and crisp.<br /><br />You can't do without it, if you're a Pink Floyd fan....or even if you're not that much of a fan.<br /><br />Super !!!
B0007XT87G|5.0|At the time of this writing, this album is number 116 on the ProgArchives.com Most Popular Album List.  Considering that one of the factors affecting the ranking on this list is the number of reviews submitted, that's pretty high for an album that's only one year old.  It is also the number one album of 2005 according to their reviewers.<br /><br />One of the disadvantages of being an old fuddy-duddy with a wife, kids, jobs, etc., is that you get out of touch with the music scene.  You listen to the albums you bought as a kid decades ago and you listen to the radio.  And you forget that musicians are still making vibrant music.  You forget that musicians have always, and will always, go past the limits set by radio marketers.<br /><br />And so I decided that I needed to hear what was currently being created by \\"progressive\\" rock bands.  And I purchased this album.<br /><br />My only previous exposure to PORCUPINE TREE were the tracks played on my XM radio (channel 51 - Music Lab).  And when you listen to the radio at work or in the car, it's easy to just lump everything together.  I know they've played live at the XM studios several times, but that was the limits of my knowledge.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the album. Deadwing isn't a thrash metal album, or even a hard rock album, but on several songs uses thematic elements of hard rock to push the mood.  But on other songs the mood tends towards a quietness that rivals YES at its most New Age.  The songs are not limited to what is commercial, but evolve on their own.<br /><br />On the other hand, my twelve year old daughter wasn't thrilled with the album.  She thought that the songs changed too much.  However, she has copied \\"Open Car\\" onto her iPod and had it featured on her MySpace page.  At 3:46 in length, it's probably the most commercial of the songs on the album.<br /><br />This is a great album to remind an old fuddy-duddy that music can still be fresh and original.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|The queen of pop makes a return to the COMMERCIAL dancefloor with 2005's best album, having already sold well over 1.3million in the U.S and 1.1million in the U.K with a further 4million world wide and rising, Confessions is a non stop tour de force dance lovers dream. Ever the visionary Madonna and her mixers down at Madonna inc have produced something far more substantial than Kylie, Mariah, Britney or J-Lo could ever have dreamt of, most critics are quick to label this as a disco album simply because of the ABBA sample, Wrong! This album may have hints of disco and 80's electronica via Kraftwerk, but confessions for all its beats is a visionary look into the future of dance, its where we are going to be in a few years time, the last time Madonna did this was with the Bjork penned Bedtime Story track, later emulated by everybody from Kylie, Britney, Massive Attack and beyond, even R.O.L owed something to this futuristic dreamy dance romp!! With Confessions Madonna has proved yet again that her interests remain in not what has happened but what is going to happen. The packaging is fantastic the new track Fighting Spirit is excellent if not more substantial than any other track on the album and the overall package itself deserves a 5 star, i wish Super Pop were on here too!!! And the next comment goes out to the folk who make comments that Madonna is ripping off Kylie of all people!!!, Who's she????? Madonna was creating dance records whilst Kylie was still at school! Kylie is a talentless bargain basement Madonna alternative who could never have afforded a career if it were not for Madonna leading the way in the first place, bow your head in shame and give the REAL queen of pop some respect, here in Europe Madonna HAS ALWAYS lead the field, she continues to do so with confessions and long may she continue and keep on doing her thing, amen.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is an excellent movie for kids and adults. I love Miyazaki's films, they're so beautiful. The animation was astounding and the characters were loveable. This is a definite film to pass on to your children and watch it along with them. It isn't my favorite of Miyazaki's but still a family favorite that will stay cherished in my heart forever.
B000002G8L|3.0|I have never heard any British band, save for the Rolling Stones, play American roots music authentically.   This is no exception.   The sound is cold, disjointed, and often uninspired.   Albert Lee, Henry Spinetti, and co just can't hit the groove to carry songs like \\"Tulsa Time\\" convincingly.   Sorry.    <br /> <br />As a contrast, compare \\"Tulsa Time\\" to the cut on \\"Backless\\".    The studio sounds more organic, more live sounding than this one!    <br /> <br />Why?    <br /> <br />The musicians were from TULSA, OKLAHOMA.   These guys grew up hearing a melting pot of country, blues, bluegrass, gospel...all American forms of music, mind you...on their radios.   This band, clearly, didn't. <br /> <br />I don't mean to sound overly snobby, but the truth is the truth.   Brits, stick to more experimental, envelope pressing music.   Let the Americans handle roots music.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have never seen a more well done movie... when you watch it you feel as if you were living among the Bennet family.  Amazing vocabulary, amazing actors and actresses, and amazing scenes.  A great family movie!!!  I bought this movie the moment it was released. I have watched it several times since them, I think it will be a timeless classic! I highly recommend that you buy this movie, you won't regret it.
B0000039QA|5.0|This 2 disc album is just a must have. I mean it's the notorious B.I.G, (after 2pac) the best rapper ever and when i bought this album my view to rap just changed. 50 cent is nothing compared to the treu king of New York (B.I.G). I like every song and every beat, only some choruses were not so good. <br /> <br />Cd 1 - 9.5/ 10 - a cd with many classics and good songs <br />1: life after death intro - 10/10 about the death of b.i.g <br />2: Somebody's gotta die - 8.5/10 good lyrics and beat, but the chorus is a bit annoying. <br />3: hypnotize - 9.5/10 very good beat  <br />4: kick in the door - 9.5/10 good beat, only the conversation should be a skit. <br />5: Fxxk you tonight - 9/10 very smooth song.  <br />6: last day - 9/10 good performance from the lox (first time i heard him) <br />7: I love the dough - 10/10 very good song with Jay-z.  <br />8: what's beef - 9.5/10 good beat (it has that italian gangster feeling) and lyrics, only diddy (or someone else) had to laugh silly at the end of the song. <br />9: B.I.G interlude - 9/10 the best skit i heard. <br />10: Mo money Mo problems - 20/10 best song of the album, contains a sample of a old song (i forgot which song). Only Mase and diddy sound almost the same. <br />11: niggas bleed - 18/10 lyracly: one of the best songs i heard, it's just story about a criminal, thanks to the beat, you get into the story. I don't get this feeling when i listen to eminem or 50 cent, only when i listen to N.W.A or this song. <br />12: I got a story to tell - 8.5/10 a song about a women who's leavin her men or something only it's kinda short about 2 min of rappin and the rest is a skit <br /> <br />Cd 2 -  <br />1: Notorious thugs - 10/10 Good song to start a cd with, the b.i.g lyrics are also used in \\"spit your game\\" from the new biggie's new album. first time i heard bone thugs-n-harmony. <br />2: Miss U - 12/10 smooth song and a bit touchy. <br />3: Another - 10/10 first time i listened to lil' kim, just a good song and is a bitfunny. <br />4: going back to Cali - 9/10 very good beat, but the chorus isn't good. <br />5: ten crack commandments - 8.5/10 interesting song about the rules of a hustla. <br />6: Playa Hater - 9/10 it's a add on, but i like it. <br />7: Nasty boy - 8.5/10 the lyrics are also used in nasty girl, off course i like nasty girl more than this one. why: the chorus of this songs sxxks, a women says about 4 times: \\"nasty boy, you're nasty\\". the beat in nasty girl is better, but in nasty girl, diddy had a very simple rap and nelly is one of the rapper i don't like. <br />8: sky's the limit - 15/10 smooth song. <br />9: the world is filled - 8/10 a bit boring song <br />10: My downfall - 15/10 starts with a phone call and than diddy or someone else starts with cursing. after that biggie starts to rap, good lyrics, especially with a good beat. only DMC is very silent on my cd player, i heard DMC for the first time on this song on my pc. <br />11: Long kiss goodnight - 8/10 agian a bit boring song and in the begin and the end of the song biggie says \\"Jah, Jah, Jah\\" which sounds kinda stupid. the good thing is the lyrics. <br />12: You're nobody (til somebody kills you) - 10/10 good song to end the album. <br /> <br />So, for me cd 1 is better than cd 2. if you're a real fan you buy this album, if not you should better buy biggie duets.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I rarely enjoy a movie as much as I did this one. It is wonderful on so many levels. It is a simply lovely movie about a great love story. <br /> <br />I have found some of the reviews posted for this movie very interesting, especially those that complain about this adaptation not being true enough to the book. I am also fascinated by the comparisons to Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy. What gives? <br /> <br />I am, perhaps, an experienced enough movie-goer that I didn't expect to see the book visually transferred to the screen. If I want to relive the story Jane Austen wrote, verbatim, I will read the book again. <br /> <br />And, as much as I admire Colin Firth, I am so impressed with Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy. His portrayal in this version is subtle and beautiful. Mr. Darcy seems more real than in any previous version thanks to the sensitivity and sensibilities in the portrayal. Matthew Macfadyen is a brilliant, talented actor and I very much look forward to seeing him on the screen again in the very near future. <br /> <br />This movie is visually stunning and well-crafted. I saw it at the theatre only once and, at first viewing, was immediately taken with the choreography of the scenes. The weaving around the ball rooms and the long camera shots are amazing. It was obvious that Joe Wright had paid a great deal of attention to each scene to get it visually right. A great movie can elicit deep emotion visually and set a mood that compliments what is happening on screen between the characters. This movie certainly accomplishes this. Joe Wright appears to have a great career as a film director ahead of him based on this work. <br /> <br />I admire the portrayal of the Bennet family in this film. I like that Joe Wright wanted to show them as a \\"real family\\" and feel it helped make the film. Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet is not nearly as annoying as the BBC version, which I greatly appreciated. She made Mrs. Bennet likable and understandable. Donald Sutherland, especially in the last scene, is wonderful. And, Keira Knightley's performance is lovely. I was very impressed and believe she deserves the all of praise she has received. She captured the essence of Elizabeth Bennet and portrayed her in a real, believable way. <br /> <br />The music is wonderful. The locations are breathtaking.  <br /> <br />The love story between Elizabeth and Darcy is timeless and this movie lacks nothing in telling their story, even with the time constraints and missing characters and dialogue from the book.  <br /> <br />If you ask me if we needed this version of their love story, I will gladly say yes.  <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Frances the Mute is a interesting mixture of punk, Latin rhythms, angular rock (think King Crimson), and psychedelia (think Atom Heart Mother).  To call their music unique is an understatement. I'll admit it is an acquired taste; not because it isn't good but rather that their music is so complex and detailed that it is impossible to discover the genius of the music with just one listen.  Every time you listen to the album, new details become apparent.    <br /> <br />The drumming is superb with the sheer volume of varied rhythmic patterns.  The percussion work is what makes the music so engaging and keeps me listening.  The vocals are definitely unique as they have an almost soulfull, female quality to them.  And I don't mean that as an insult because his vocal range is such that he pulls it off without it sounding out of place.   <br /> <br />Even more impressive is that the band can write long, epic songs that don't bore or get bogged down in severely repetitive patterns.  Cassandra Geminni is over 33 minutes long and captivates the listener for the entire duration.  The Mars Volta have been criticized a bit for their extended use of emotive musical filler at the ends of the earlier tracks on the album; but that issue doesn't show up during Cassandra Geminni.  There are segments of this song suite that sound like they'd fit right in with Pink Floyd's album Atom Heart Mother and yet at other times the music sounds like something from Santana, especially the drumming. <br /> <br />This is a very impressive album and band.  And while my musical tastes definitely gravitate towards symphonic prog and prog metal, I must say that I'm quite the fan of this work.  The Mars Volta are also important in the fact that they are blazing a new trail in prog music much like King Crimson did 35 years ago.  And if they keep up the stunningly high quality of their current work, they stand the chance to be influential to this generation of prog music as King Crimson was to their generation. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I saw the movie and then watched the series.  Definately worth any sci fi fans time and money! <br /> <br />
B000AJJNPY|5.0|When you encounter a rock quartet from Iceland with a guitarist who plays more with a cello bow than a pick or fingers, unique would be the first word to come to mind. When I try to categorize Sigur Ros in relation to something else, the closest I can come to successfully comparing is \\"Radiohead on Acid.\\" Even that still isn't a just comparison.<br /><br />Takk... is an amazing album. The songs just unfold. The music builds and swells to breathtaking climaxes. The music is unbelievably dynamic. The vocals are downright angelic. The texture is thick and rich. The album is produced in a manner that creates an unbelievable experience for the listener. The sounds come together to create a sort of sonic nirvana that can be found in almost no other music. The string arrangements are uplifting to the soul. There is honestly nothing on this album that I would change. Everything fits together perfectly to provide the listener with everything that they want. The music is so interesting that unlike most outfits of popular music, the listener doesn't have to turn to the text of the lyrics in order to maintain interest. Which is important, because unless you know Icelandic, the lyrics have little to offer you. The sounds simply just wash over the listener. I honestly cannot do a just description of this album. You'll have to take my for it that this album will simply give you an experience of pure elation that you have never felt before.
B0006FFRW0|1.0|I give this album one star solely because the CD side WILL NOT play in a computer!  I love the content of the album; it's one of my favorites.  The remixes are all pretty good, from listening to the album in a CD player or as a DVD.  I'm not sure if it's some sort of copy protection that prevents play in a computer, or poor manufacturing techniques, but either way the producer of the album should be ashamed.
0060899190|5.0|READ THIS BOOK! It will touch you in some way. <br /> <br />If you have a secret that is eating you inside.. send it, tell it, sell it.. do whatever you have to do to let it go. <br /> <br />That's exactly what the people who posted cards did in this book. Some were funny, some revealing, painful, and too close to home. This is an excellent quick read.. and a definite ice breaker as a \\"coffee table book.\\" Everyone who comes to my home picks it up and has to read the entire thing.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|A truly \\"kids\\" movie.  Kids are the stars, and the aliens.  What a terriffic twist to the end.  Great Sci-fi in outer space adventure and fun from start to finish.
0393327655|2.0|I completely agree with Harris's thesis that religious faith is an important mediator for which violent behavior is acted on or tolerated.  Which is one reason why I am so disappointed that the book was this poorly written. <br /> <br />It's very unfocused in its approach.  For the first few chapters you will find yourself reading a plethora of information and facts without a backboned understanding of the idea that is trying to be conveyed.  Religion is bad, we get it, but what other reason are you jumping around so much? <br /> <br />My biggest complaint about the book comes from the chapter entitled \\"The problem with Islam\\", my suggestion would be to skip that entire section.  Never will you find a better example of \\"out-group homogenization\\" in your life.  ALL Muslims are potential terrorists who believe that the only good infidel is a dead infidel, may very well sum up Harris's entire rant during this section.  His believe comes from a well documented psychological phenomenon in which, when it comes to groups the self is not involved in (out-groups), the worst characteristics of the few can be applied to the whole.  Thus, a few suicide bombers are indicative of the entire Muslim mentality.  Harris must expect us to use reason when tackling his arguments, right?  Then my reason dictates that if Harris doesn't have base rate statistics of the behaviors in which Harris believes all Muslims are capable of, then we can reject his homogenized analysis.  Oh Sam would be proud of me, don't you think? <br /> <br />Not only that, but in this chapter, Harris decides to go after Chomsky, who bravely stated that 9-11 was the result of poor American foreign policy.  Harris's main attack of such an easily verifiable statement is that the foreign decisions made by American politicians were not intended to kill innocent people.  Doesn't take a moral philosopher to understand that this is a ludicrous moral defense of actions.  Nor, does it attack Chomsky's main point.  So what'syour point Harris? <br /> <br />As an aside,  I do not agree, on scientific grounds, that religion is the `cause' of past and present accepted violence, but more the catalyst through which violence is focused.  Simply put, without religion we would still find ways to kill one another for unreasonable and simply stupid reasons. But I digress. <br /> <br />Thus, I'm pulled between recommending this book or not.  I think the thesis is important and must be confronted, yet the delivery is frustrating and dull.
B00000IQW3|5.0|Great movie for young and old alike.  Our hero saves the universe and gets the girl, all without foul language or sexual content.  No nudity, which makes it even more pleasurable to view.
B000E97HIA|5.0|As a new Prince fan, I am proud to be apart of this new Prince album era. This is an absolutely brilliant album. <br /> <br />Prince experiments with great and futuristic sounds. The beats are addicting and groovy. <br /> <br />Great party album... I hope he has a successful year. <br /> <br />This is by far Prince's best album since Around the World In A Day! Not to mention it is slated to be his first No. 1 Billboard debut since 1985! <br /> <br />GOOD JOB PRINCE! <br /> <br />THIS IS A MUST BY FOR 2006!
B000DZIGDU|1.0|I can't imagine during World War II or even the highly protested war, Vietnam the disgraceful release of a movie such as this.  Our Marine Corp troops were depicted as drop outs that could not accomplish anything else so they joined the corp.  They were an undisciplined, unruly bunch that were \\"trigger happy\\", couldn't think of much else besides \\"masturbation\\", their women at home were incapable of being faithful.  They were so poorly trained that the Marine on gaurd duty would have an open flame next to a box of ammunition, and the star of the movie \\"wet his pants\\" when first experiencing enemy fire. <br /> <br />The only 2 movies I have seen regarding Desert Shield/Storm have illustrated a joke of a war.  How is it that we were able to accomplish our objectives in an extremely short period of time with limited casualties and not feel a sense of pride.  Instead Hollywood makes a shameful joke out it and our troops.  Our military is in harm's way protecting our rights including the right to \\"Freedom of Speech\\" and this is how you repay them!
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Based on the familiar story of CHICKEN LITTLE, this animated movie isn't great but entertaining enough.  We all know that Chicken Little thought the sky was falling when it was only an acorn that clobbered him.  In this version, the little peep is trying to live that mistake down and make an impression on his athletic hero father.  I think the movie's main problem is that it actually becomes two different movies; after the heroic baseball game in which Chicken Little wins the big one, it's a WAR OF THE WORLDS spoof with aliens and destruction en masse.  This lack of focus makes the movie incoherent, but there are still some funny bits and some neat characters:  Little Alien Kirby and the Goldfish were my faves.  The voice talents of Zach Graff, Joan Cusack, Garry Marshall and Steve Zahn are used effectively and this was the late Don Knotts' last movie as well.  Children should enjoy it and less discriminating adults like myself should find it fun, too!
B000B8I8X2|4.0|I felt that the CD is good overall but there are some stinkers. The songs The Dagger, The Enemy, Annihilation By The Hands Of God, Independent (Voice Of The Voiceless), Baptized In The Redemption, and Constitution Down are all solid and deliver.

B000E33VWW|5.0|CAPOTE is a mesmerizing film, beautifully directed by Bennett Miller and showing why the brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman won this year's Best Actor.  Hoffman inhabits the role so amazingly that you never once doubt he's Truman Capote.  Capturing the physical and vocal idiosyncrasies of the noted novelist, Hoffman is a wonder to behold.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally good:  Catherine Keener as novelist Harper Lee; Clifton Collins Jr. as the brutal and manipulative Perry Smith; Chris Cooper as the KBI agent who helps Capote out; and Mark Pellegrino as the other murderer, Richard Hickock.  They all deliver superb performances.<br /><br />The movie focuses on the seven years Capote spent researching his classic novel IN COLD BLOOD and shows how manipulative and self-serving Capote was, and how this book brought about his own personal downfall.<br /><br />I saw CRASH and although it is a good movie, I think overall CAPOTE is just a bit better.  Worth seeing.
B00005JOE8|5.0|At last...    Having read the Alan Moore graphic novel a few years back and found it interesting, knew this movie would be a blast or a bomb (sorry bad pun).    The movie is simply vitamins for the mass media mind, agree or disagree - it gives a voice on governments abuse of inducing fear to the public minds, aswell as a view point seen from a \\"terrorists\\" mind - it basically gives a voice on what war is about from BOTH sides and both sides are equally terrifying, soldier or terrorist - its the same, they both kill people at the end of the day!     All this is from this movies view point,  but what an interesting movie it all turns out to be - very nicely done, acting, effects and atmosphere all great!    The movie is deeper than Sin City because it relates to a lot of the sorry issues we are in today - do yourself a favour get this DVD!!    A cool movie with a unique voice - recommended!!
B000001G16|5.0|I have been a Bon Jovi fan for over twenty years and always thought Richie Sambora was very underrated and unappreciated for his guitar playing. Happened to pick this CD up out of curiosity recently and WoW.  <br /> <br />This is a great album. Deserves to be heard. It is very Blues influenced and doesn't sound like Bon Jovi at all.  <br /> <br />Just buy it.
B000002JAX|4.0|I didn't find this CD to be as fabulous as careless love but, still enjoy it.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Once you get past the politics and mud throwing surrounding this documentary you will see a very good constructed piece. Served with humor and above all intended to challenge you. Bring out the spotlight and the magnifying glass and start questioning everything they serve you as \\"faith\\", \\"the truth\\", etc on a daily basis. Not the easiest way to go, but much more fulfilling. The fact that this Michael Moore feature at least inspires people to have an opinion is a plus. How much of the (dis) information you get each day do you remember the next day? Not the case here. By the way, sometimes a documentary is just a documentary.
0440241588|1.0|I am a long-time Grisham fan, and would like to ask: \\"Mr. Grisham, what's happened to you?\\" The book is written at no more than a sixth-grade level, with short sentences and easy words. My daughter thinks he's hired a ghost writer, and if that's the case, he needs to find someone else! The book is BORING, with a good part of it taking place in restaurants and describing food. Another large part is devoted to Joel Backman's learning Italian. If you understand ANY Italian, that makes the book even WORSE, because he translates EVERYTHING. So, someone says, \\"Molto bene!\\" and then Grisham writes, Very Good! You'll be reading everything twice. But here's the worst part: The CIA plots to release Backman, \\"hide\\" him in Italy, and then give out his whereabouts, BECAUSE THE CIA CANNOT KILL AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, not here or abroad. This is the premise of the book. Well, guess what? About a third of the way through the book, THE CIA KILLS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. So much for the premise of the book! Don't the editors read these books any more? By the way, I did force myself to finish the book (I'm sorry now). The reason I finished it was that, thinking I knew Grisham, I figured that Joel Backman would save himself with some brilliant scheme. NOT SO! Nothing brilliant or even lucky about it. It's just a stupid, stupid book. The part I liked the best was when he bounced his 2-year-old granddaughter on his knee. That's the high point of the book! So, to summarize: (1) Simplistic writing that insults your intelligence, (2) NO PLOT, (3) boring restaurant and food descriptions, (4) boring Italian lesson descriptions, (5) NO BRILLIANT SCHEME, (6) did I mention this book has NO PLOT? MR. GRISHAM, WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?????
B00008RH1H|5.0|Throne of Blood is a masterpiece by one of the world's greatest film makers at the height of his powers.  <br /> <br />Only Kurosawa could take the essence of Shakespearian stage drama and incorporate it into the medium of film as a dynamic tour de force. Yet at the same time he remains faithful to elements of Noh (a stagy traditional Japanese play-form in which design and movement are minimalized). A seeming contradiction, dynamism and static-ness yet Kurosawa masters both in the same medium.  As usual; acting, writing, cinematography, sound, direction and production are all pitch perfect.  <br /> <br />In this second Shakespearian based film by Kurosawa, focus is on the interplay of fate,  free will and the fine thread the human psyche uses to weave the two together. On a more simpler level it is a man living and dying by the sword. In short what goes around comes around. What comes around for Toshiro Mifune as he gets his just deserts is a scene with straight as an arrow, perfect direction by Kurosawa leading to quite a pointed culminatin of events (pun intended...see the movie you'll understand). <br /> <br />Bonus features include excellent linear notes as well as the superb commentary of Donald Richie. Few people are more knowledgeable about film and Japanese film then he. The commentary is almost as interesting as the movie itself.  <br /> <br />As usual Criterion presents its film in pristine condition. Some may complain that Criterion is too pricey but with them you get the best cinema has to offer. You cannot go wrong. One Kurosawa masterpiece packs more poignancy, punch and philosophy then 10 lesser films thus you get 10 times the movie at 5 times the price, really quite a deal if you look at it that way. <br />

0316172324|5.0|I listened to the audio book version of Blink. The Amazon reviews here that try to pry out the book's shortcomings are missing the point entirely - you can read this book and personally understand a lot more about how you, as a modern, civilized, human being actually function in real life, not in between the covers of some peer-reviewed science or psychology journal. <br /> <br />For example, I could never understand why, even after years away, I could perfectly navigate my way around San Francisco, until my wife started to question if I knew where I was going! The author, in relating his understanding of how the mind functions in split-second decisions, explains that right-brain (visual) functionality, becomes impeded when left-brain (verbal) functionality (answering questions) is forced to kick in. No wonder I don't like it when people talk 'at me' when I am trying to think - I think visually! <br /> <br />I can't wait to read Gladwell's Tipping Point!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Cranky Reviewer, no one likes you and no one likes Britney anymore(chuckles). This b*tch killed her own career with this album which sold less than her three previous records combined. As for the singles, Me Against the Music with the gini wap Hagdonna tanked. Toxic was a fluke hit which ripped off James Bond movie music. Lastly, Everytime was a ridiculous whine-infested ballad. More fans abandoned her after this due to her wild child behavior, stealing men from expecting mothers(the most famous being Pervin Freeloader), her abusive attitude towards fans(refusing autographs, yelling verbal swears at her), consistent lying and so on has ruined her. She should now join Tiffany, Debbie Gibson and so on at the place my buddy Roger Waters immortalized \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home for incurable tyrants and kings\\" as she is a former.
B000E5N62U|5.0|This album is solid.  I bought the special DVD version.  I've played it so far only on my computer - through an Audigy sound card and 5.1 speakers - the sound is amazing!    <br /> <br />This will be the first album put on my new iPod - Nightfly and Kamikirad will follow when Donald releases the boxed set of his trilogy - said to be in the works. <br /> <br />The man is a genius.  Buy this album!
B000E33VWW|5.0|\\"Capote\\" the film is not about the life of Truman Capote, but its about a period of his life when he saw an article in the newspaper about the murders of four family members in Holcomb, Kansas, and decided to write about it. <br /> <br />I think this film is very educational for those who don't know anything about Truman Capote or the Kansas murders in 1959, and for those interested in reading further about Capote or the Kansas case may do so.  I would also recommend watching the original \\"In Cold Blood\\" film with Robert Blake playing Perry Smith, rather than the latest remake. <br /> <br />I had read for years how writing and experiencing \\"In Cold Blood\\" took a big toll on Capote, and this film helps bring that home.  He wanted to help Perry Smith, but his helping prolonged the appeals process and being able to finish his book.  One can begin to see and feel the mixed feelings Truman Capote has towards the killers, especially Perry Smith.  He starts out wanting to help them, but becomes frustrated when his help has kept the appeals process dragging on for years.  He wants to finish his book but cannot until the killers are executed.  And he feels guilty for wanting them dead.  He didn't want them dead, but he did.  He visits with Perry Smith's sister who tells Capote not to be fooled by Perry and his supposed sensitivity and sweetness.  She said Perry would rather kill someone than say hello. <br /> <br />Capote tells Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) that he felt like he and Perry grew up in the same house, only that Perry got up and went out the back door, and he (Capote) got up and went out the front door.  They both had alcoholic mothers and abusive or neglectful fathers. <br /> <br />Towards the end when Perry telegrams Capote asking for help to find a new lawyer, Capote writes back that he searched for one (he really didn't) but couldn't find one.  Capote takes to his bed and won't take phone calls when he hears the executions are finally going through - no moreappeals.  He goes to Kansas and visits with the killers one last time and starts to cry when he walks in the room.  Perry asks him to be at the hanging and he agrees, even though he probably would have rather been in bed with the covers pulled over his head. <br /> <br />The extra interviews with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Chris Cooper, Catherine Keener et al really add to the DVD.  There is also a small clip of an interview with the real Truman Capote. <br /> <br />Recommend. <br /> <br />
B000CNESU8|5.0|Striking, Prophetic, Political, Philosophical, Relevant, Ironic, Believable, Grim & Hilarious. I may be gushing, but all this is Network. With modest expectations in the winter of 1976, my best friend and I saw the premier of Network in the theater. Stunned by its brilliance, we then adjourned to a diner and spent hours discussing its finer points. Network instantly made my Top 10 \\"desert island\\" list, and remains there today.  <br /> <br />So why did this movie fizzle, under-appreciated, and fade away? Believe it or not, most people I witnessed at the time, dismissed Network as dramatic whimsy. An oddball comedy of sorts. Hey, this film lost the Oscar to Rocky! These weren't exactly \\"heady\\" times. The movie's only line regularly recalled being \\"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!\\". A stupefying result, when one considers the abundant richness of Paddy Chayefsky's script. There are 5 monologue/rants by Howard Beale (Peter Finch), AND one scorcher by Arthur Jensen (Ned Beatty), that alone are worth the price of admission. The Max schumacher (William Holden) break-up monologue is also priceless. Reciting these excerpted monologues at NYC poetry readings in the 1990's consistently brought applause and discourse. The script is taught and vivid, with little dross.  <br /> <br />All roads in the plot lead to the desensitization, illusion, and corrupting influence of television, and it's ability to systematically lower our standards and humanitarian values. People are reduced to superficial 2-dimensional comic-strip fodder. Real feelings are coldly and mindlessly bastardized into metaphorical split-seconds, freeze-frames and instant replays. Ultimately none of the characters escape unscathed. Network is also a blinding indictment of corporate greed, and the public's ability to be led like cattle. So why would you want to watch such cynicism and dysfunctia. Well, amazingly, this film is simultaneously quite funny, and it employs great \\"what if\\" ideas and set-pieces, that truly excite and make the imagination soar. Further, it's an excellent wake-up call for those who too often pass on real life in favor of the blue light of the cathode ray tube.  <br /> <br />Lumet's eye for direction is unerring. And Juliet Taylor's casting is subtly impeccable, from the headliners, through the supporting cast, down to even the bit parts. Though Faye Dunaway's ability to convince does waver occasionally. Finch, Beatty, Holden, & Robert Duval truly shine in top form, skillfully making moments out of lines that a lesser cast  would miss. Then again, with a script this juicy, it's hard to miss.  <br /> <br />And what's more, time has done nothing to diminish the films relevancy. If anything, time has enhanced it. This is a film to see annually, like the \\"Wizard Of Oz\\" was when you were a kid. Sadly, this film had remained a \\"best kept secret\\" for decades. Now there's this 2-disc 30th Anniversary edition. Eureka, never thought I'd see the day. Thinkers, you are not alone. Actually, I credit Network's resurgence to Randi Rhodes, God bless her, who is the first public figure I know to ever plug this movie gem. Catch her on Air America radio. Randi has sterling taste. Hey, she too is a big fan of early Alice Cooper. What more could a guy want, but that's another subject. Bottom line, the western world needs to see this film...and digest it. Bon appetit. <br />

B00008EY9G|3.0|..One of those movies where you have to watch it twice to pick up on all the little details. Not a blockbuster movie but definetly passed the time nicely on a rainy Sunday! I'd watch it again.

B0006MT314|5.0|This cd is great. I love all the music on it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I normally dont write reviews, but since i usually use reviews as reference  to buying new music  I've decided to finally write a review...   <br />It would do this CD no justice whatsoever to describe it as amazing or incredible  it surpasses that  i personally found the music to be at my first listening, overwhelming  and then i felt i transcended through this music,  its emotional power and expression impacted me deeply,  I havnt felt this way about music since being introduced to PInk Floyd by a friend of mine...as a matter of fact,The mars Volta is the angry side of Pink Floyd.  Check it out  youll be amazed.
B000301YY8|1.0|James Blunt makes me cringe. His \\"sincerity\\" feels so so calculated, even if it isn't. I feel like he is the sensitive musician you see in a bad comedy, (I just saw JUST FRIENDS) if you know what I mean. Also to compare him to Elliott Smith is absurd, wrong, and insulting to Mr. Smith. It also seems to me that Blunt is the Huge Corporation attempt to attract fans of good un-mainstream music. I truly would not be surprised if Alanis Morissette fans dug this. And Morissette fans frankly don't have any taste. Also, I noticed that this review has been looked at by the most people... Blunt is apparantly what people are checking out, and that's sad, when there is so much more out there.
B000003NA3|4.0|Does anyone know whether this set will become available on SACD or DVD Audio format?  How would you contact GRP records to ask? I only give it four stars until multichannel format appears.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|Por ahi lei que esta pelicula seria para esta decada lo que Seven fue para los noventas, y que razon tenian. Es una pelicula cuya trama  nos mantiene inmersos y con la u&ntilde;as clavadas en el sillon. Saw tiene esos momentos fuertes y sangrientos que hacen taparse los ojos a aquellos de voluntad (y estomago) debil. Tiene un guion muy bueno y la direccion y fotografia en general excelentes tambien. Pero cabe destacar que esta pelicula no es para toda la gente ya que contiene violencia (completamente) explicita y escenas algo fuertes. Pero si te gusta el Gore y buscas una pelicula con una buena historia (no como la mayoria de las de tipo B) estilo Seven, Saw definitivamente es para ti.<br /><br />PD. Esta edicion especial es increible, la portada viene en una burbuja con liquido rojo (supuestamente sangre) con una sierra impresa en un plastico por separado que flota dentro de la burbuja. Los subtitulos en espa&ntilde;ol son muy bien recibidos. Es una magnifica adicion para cualquier amante del cine, ya sea o no coleccionista.
B0000046KM|5.0|Shirely Horn has always seemed like a warm human being.  There is charactor to her voice and style.  She was an elegant woman whose singing gripped my heart.  This album is a good representative of the quality of music she gave us.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|Muchos fans se quejaron de la adaptacion de la historia del videojuego a la pelicula, sin embargo es necesario crear un guion muy diferente para una pelicula que finalmente fue hecha como un negocio, esto tomando en cuenta que esta pelicula no es de tipo B. En un juicio personal creo que fue una adaptacion muy buena en la cual solo toman los temas principales de la historia original y actualizan el ambiente del laboratorio, ademas seamos realistas, una corporaci&oacute;n multinacional tan grande como Umbrella merecia  un lugar mas digno, no creen?<br /><br />Personalmente me gusto mas esta pel&iacute;cula que su continuaci&oacute;n, en la segunda se fueron mas por el lado comercial y taquillero, obviamente la primera tambien lo fue, pero no tanto como la segunda.<br /><br />En resumen es una muy buena pel&iacute;cula comercial de Zombies, cuenta con buenos efectos y ese par sustos que nos hacen brincar en el momento menos esperado y lo mejor de todo... tiene a Milla. ;)
6305311463|5.0|I must say that this is one of my top 5 favorite movies.  Sure there are a lot of haters and bashers of the film but like what other's have said, you should take it for what it is, an action film with special effects.  Although everything is not 100% accurate in terms of reality, however the point is appreciating the visuals, the audio, and the overall roller coaster ride of a storyline.  This movie has other deeper themes such as honor, sacrafice,love, and reconciliation and redemtion. For what it's worth I belive the deeper themes to the movie make it more of appreciated and show the better side of humanity.  Our heros in this film have their own personal hangups, baggage, and flaws but make a difference in what they do.  Personally, I'd recommend this film for these reasons more if anything.  And the original music score was beautiful!  Very dramatic and memorable.  (Got the CD). Just see it for yourself.  Enjoy!
0446677450|5.0|A must read for anyone wondering why their dollars aren't going further and how they might change their relationship with money so that it works for you rather than you working for it.
B000EQ5SR0|5.0|I don't know why so many people are talking crap about this movie. I thought it completely immersed you in this futuristic world. Charlize Theoren was the perfect choice for Aeon and it makes a sort of Actor/Director connection that makes this movie great. This film reminds me of the original (Matrix and Ghost in the Shell). This movie is about a huge conspiracy that the population of this world is unaware of. Also a resistance has been formed to stop this illusion. It may seem confusing at first, buy you just have to \\"think outside the box\\" in order to understand it. Also don't let a horney immature thirteen year boy watch this DVD, cause their's a scene when Aeon is half naked which was (SWEET)! I also recommed y'all get (Ultraviolent) the movie, when it comes to DVD. It's better then Aeon Flux. <br /> <br />I love this movie like I love \\"Hakugei: The Legend of Moby Dick\\" its an anime series.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This may be the best Hard Rock/Heavy metal product since Metallica's \\"...And Justice For All\\".  This album makes you remember what rock and roll is all about.  Turn up the volume and enjoy.
1400079179|1.0|It's sad that trees died for this book.<br /><br />Bad high school level writing, lame made-for-TV plot, public knowlege \\"secrets\\", completely predictable ending.<br /><br />I give it a less than one star rating if I could.
B000E97HIA|3.0|The problem with this CD, like so many of his past releases in the last several years, is that all the technically well-crafted songs just aren't that memorable. I can't recall a single enjoyable melody even after two straight listens, and I've already become bored with the album.  Compare the material here with stronger, more inventive songs from THE GOLD EXPERIENCE, COME, or even BATMAN and you'll notice that nothing really stands out.
1590581814|2.0|While being a respectable 1940's style noir presentation, Mr. Sallis' words overpower his character's actions. Perhaps that's the curse of the short novel, which this is. The downside created the lack of an avenue to connect with the Driver as much as I should have.<br /><br />Something else also bothered me about this book. I felt like I had read this story before.  I was right. There's a book called The Company She Keeps by Georgia Durante. It's a true life story published in 1998 of a woman who drove getaway cars for the Mob who later became a stunt driver. The Company She Keeps is also 456 pages of true life experiences including domestic abuse and celebrity fame.<br /><br />If you like reading about action, adventure and inspiration then The Company She Keeps by Georgia Durante is the book for you.
B00005JO9J|5.0|What is there not to like about this show? I watch it faithfully every Sunday and it is so much fun to look back and see where it all began - Burke and Cristina, McDreamy and Grey - it's just fantastic. The DVD is a great way to reminisce but it's also great for catching up - if you want to get involved with Grey's, pick this up and get started. I recommend it to everyone - even if you just pause it to stare at Patrick Dempsey.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful, emotionally honest, and heartbreaking films I've ever seen.  I've long admired Ang Lee (the director), but he's now become a hero of mine.  That this film \\"played in Peoria\\" as well as to sold out crowds in San Francisco is a tribute to its artistry and powerfully universal message: that real love transcends emotional conflict, bigotry, and even death.
B00004RF97|5.0|All three movies came together. They came in just a few days and in great shape.
B0002DB0FO|4.0|The show is great like most commenst wrote before. But there is one thing i don`t get. Why aren't the other seasons not available yet? I would buy them and i'm waiting now for more then six months for at least season two. <br />Come one Warner! Put it out!
067101756X|4.0|A very interesting & believable read about devices supposedly taken from the roswell 1947 crash of a alien craft, and transferred into mainstream industry by the author while serving at the pentagon in the 60's.
0553278223|3.0|I love Ray Bradbury and was sure that I'd enjoy this book.  And I tried, really.  I realize it's a commentary on society, but I just couldn't get into it.  The book started well but then it fizzled for me and was just too disjointed.  I really wanted to love this book but I couldn't.  I'll have to stick to Bradbury's other great books.
6305128952|3.0|Cinematography *****  Acting ****  Directing **  Screenplay **    A family with deep wounds and emotional issues meets a cattle rustler with an equally deep need to heal.    Kudos to Kristin Scott Thomas, Scarlett Johansson, and Chris Cooper for their great performances and especially to Robert Richardson for his breath-taking cinematography. Montana sure is purty.     Here's a fun game to play: try to find a single scene where Robert Redford's character, Tom Booker, is not dishing out advice. I found his constant borage of counsel quite tiresome. Toward the end of the film I was expecting him to promote his new book, \\"Surviving Utter Rash\\" or \\"Branding: How I Learned to Trust My Rancher\\" or \\"Controlled Grazing: Bovine Eating Disorders and Weight Management\\" If you like Dr. Phil you'll love The Horse Whisperer.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I have seen a lot of Gay Drama films; unlike the rest, this is pretty similar to what most gay guys have gone through. This is to say, that all gay men have loved another gay guy that hasn't returned that love, felt confused and even scared to let people know (especially if you live in rural America) who they are, and like this movie there are still hate crimes because of who people are. <br /> <br />People have really saw this movie as being about gay cowboys. However, I think it questions who we are as gay men and what this country is to still allow hate crimes to continue. In just looking at the critiques posted here, we can clearly see that people aren't welcoming of other views; therein lies the problem with the USA. If anything Brokeback Mountain reminds me of a foreign film, but highly relatable.
B00004R9A4|5.0|My daughter was so excited to get this movie. She loves it. We all do, it is so well acted and extemely entertaining! Enjoy!
1932100385|4.0|Although the style is a bit rough at times, the greater message should come across clearly. The science is superb, the study is eye-opening, and the message should be taken, \\"as seriously as a heart attack.\\" <br />Since reading this book I have dropped my 3 cholesterol drugs (Lipitor, Niacin, and Zetia), lost ten pounds, and feel fresher and more energized.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My family enjoyed this sci/fi--western series immensely.  So sorry it had to end!
0393327655|3.0|I bought it and like it.  HOWEVER, it's sad such a smart and funny guy as Harris has to be so distracted by purist side issues.  <br /> <br />It's two-fold:  The book is a crystal clear description of ideas C.S. Lewis handily put down a generation ago, but in a different context.  It's also right in its evaluation of Islamists-- they are going to push us all to the breaking point and that's their aim. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, we believers give Harris plenty of ammo with which to rightfully take aim.  But one cannot blame God for man's shortcomings or mistakes. <br /> <br />However, any thinking man would have to admit after careful truth searching and logical analysis God is quite evident.  The only questions are how do we know what He expects and how do we respond once we know His ways are not necessarily ours?  Do we even care what God wants?  What are the logical repercussions of denying His sovereignty?  Is THAT what we are seeing now?  A world in denial? <br /> <br />I recommend buying this book and reading it AFTER reading a great apologetic synopsis.   <br /> <br />God can stand up to the critics, although Harris puts up a good fight.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie \\"wind-up\\" to the \\"Firefly\\" series.  Sorry it had to end!
B00007LTIB|4.0|This album is often forgotten amongst the many Yes classic albums. The power of Gates of Delirium really controls the music here.  Then there's the real contrast at the end of the record, To Be Over.  It's probably good Patrick Moraz only recorded one studio record with Yes, 'lest the comparisons with Rick Wakeman.  Moraz really shines here.
B000EGDC0A|5.0|If you have never heard of Goldfrapp before I must tell you to buy all three of their albums.  Also, whatever single you can get ahold of! lol  Alison Goldfrapp has one of those voices that's not humanly possible.  She takes you on a ride with the sound of her voice and Goldfrapp's electronic cords and beats.  This is my favorite artist of todays age..
B000002GQE|5.0|For whatever reason, I waited 9 years to replace the original CD release I have with this remaster, and it is a very impressive improvement over the original. If you've got the equipment, it'll give you a whole new perspective of this album - it's that good.
B00006AW2F|4.0|You don't want to buy this album if you're not familiar with the Stones. This is a collection of pre-Sticky Fingers outtakes that didn't make the cut on the original early London albums. Don't get me wrong - this is a great bunch of songs, but they are probably only appreciated by people already very familiar with the early Stones. Buy Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, and maybe Aftermath before venturing here.
B000003489|5.0|I like this better than any other Coltrane CD I own. It's very melodic, which probably makes it more accessible, and it also has Paul Chambers on bass (Kind of Blue). Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I would recommend this to newbies as well as old hacks. As for the sound: The older version is cheaper and has very good sound, but this version has superior presence and air.
0684857219|5.0|I have read many reviews in here and I'm quite fascinated with those who disagree with his work, dedication and the tips and tricks of the trade. <br /> <br />First of all, i will disregard Marcus's review on the fact that Arnold will hinder or doesn't help muscle building.  I think you should go back to school and understand the science of the food and then you can apply that knowledge into what Arnold has explained in the diet section.  Hardgainer = no such things. <br /> <br />Everything comes with hard work and smart moves in training.  I have been training and eating properly virtually all my life and I can easily say that not only genes help but its also the  environment.  His book, his body and his health speaks of his longevity for a \\"bodybuilder\\".  You can only say if it hinders if you don't see gains within 2-3 years.  That's how normally a body responds to hard work.  Please take some PE lessons.  Compare those kids who are training whatever sports and by the time they finish school, they're quite athletic or in their prime to be called a champion.  Same thing with bodybuilding! <br /> <br />I have been training and following since Arnold's time in Flex and Joe Weider's magazines naturally.  I can testify that the particular exercises are mainly for bodybuilding.  Powerlifting, you may want to go elsewhere, that's another domain of weights.  I will argue the point that a hardgainer is either an overweight person who cannot lose weight or a person who is extremely skinny and has a condition in someways and cannot make gains.   <br /> <br />Genetic freak?  I did my research on Arnie and he didn't use the steroids for pumping himself.  He rather used for another purpose in his training, that's toning his muscle.  Whether that's valid or not, you can see the result and the difference compared with the other bodybuilders of his time and today's as well.  Marcus, get your facts rights, the steroids doesn't help recovery.  I am just disagreeing with many thingsthat you say and you give misleading information or uneducated lessons. <br /> <br />His book is the type of book that will educate the newbies. It will also help with dieting.  Training to fatigue = competition level.  Not many people would want to go that far unless you have the drive.  This books is the science and the hard work that the king of all time has put for many of us.  I would recommend this book for people at all levels due to my own results.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This film is simply the best adaptation of a graphic novel in existence. The \\"cool\\" visuals and over-the-top action sequences are complemented by classic noir themes and (especially during the \\"That Yellow Bastard\\" segment) subtle and intelligent symbolism. The characters are processed and amped-up representations of their film noir archetypes, and the actors play their parts perfectly. Mickey Rourke's performance is undoubtedly the highlight, much to my surprise. The DVD is lacking in aspects such as special features, and I had trouble playing it in a certain DVD player of mine, but that might have been the fault of the (rather old) player. It worked fine in all other players I've tried, so this shouldn't be a deterrent from buying it. This is a great film and well worth owning for repeated viewings. Due to the violence subject matter, it won't be for everyone, though. Keep the kids away.
0930289234|5.0|The plot details and major themes of \\"Watchmen\\" are available everywhere you look, so I won't bog this review down by going over them. I must simply say that this is the greatest graphic novel ever written, and one of my favorites novels of all time. It's well paced, it has brilliant characterization, and artwork that is dramatic while never betraying its realism. The story is broad in scope and touches on many different themes but remains very personal and even touching, at times. This book is well worth buying as it requires at least two reads to truly absorb all the little details that make it so rewarding. Years after I first read it, I still enjoy picking it up from time to time and enjoying it as a whole, or in parts.
0307263118|5.0|This is an extraordinary piece of literature..at the level of a Steinbeck. The story itself is very moving and touches the core of the deepest of human emotions: Love and Loss. Banville's literary style is the richest of any of the other modern authors I have read.

B00064WSN2|5.0|I actually prefer this second King Crimson album to their debut. \\"Cat Food\\" is one of my favorite Crimson songs ever.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Coming off the back of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown - Tarantino returns to the screen with a film that is an ode to every Japanese samurai and Chinese martial arts film.  Vol 1 focuses more on the Japanese film tradition, with the Bride (Uma Thurman) chasing down and dishing out revenge in ways only she knows how.  In this part of the film, Vernita Green, \\"Copperhead\\" (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) fall victim to the Bride's well considered and stunningly executed plans for payback. <br /> <br />My favourite scene has to be the climatic fight with Vernita Green.  Other scenes, such as the arrival of the Crazy 88 at the 'House of Blue Leaves' (silhouettes on rice paper screens as the gang members run down the halls to enter the main room) just made the film an absolute viewing pleasure for me.  Everytime I see the film, I keep looking for some of the references to other notorious Asian films. <br /> <br />Its shocking (the first time I saw the opening sequence in the cinemas, I was surprised), the arterial bleeding (a la the samurai films), the fight scenes, the movie references and the mere existence of Go Go Yubari make the journey towards the ultimate 'end' well worth the time to get through.
B000E97HIA|5.0|\\"3121\\" gets five stars only from those who are paid by the record label to write bogus reviews.\\" - Actually Jason, those who rate this album five stars are the ones who have good taste in music. Shows how much you know (which is nothing). Next time, when you write a review, try to put some thought into it. Don't just write words for the sake of writing them to show your mom you actually learned something in grade school.
B0007Y08I8|1.0|Is \\"Team America\\" a de facto propaganda film on the Iraq War and Bush administration's foreign policy for adolescents (and those of us with adolescent humor)?  <br /> <br />It is certainly not a Leni Riefenstahl film or a Soviet style propaganda film by Dmitry Vasiliev. It is much funnier (which isn't hard since generally the Nazis or Soviets were not the funniest film makers to go down the pike). It also pokes fun at the Bush military.  <br /> <br />On the other hand effective contemporary propaganda works far better if it appears to be even handed and incorporates humor. It does not have to be state sponsored but works well within the current corporate system of appropriating values for career advancement.  <br /> <br />It is well known from interviews that the political stances of Parker and Stone are pro Bush. They poke a quick jab at the military's overzealousness. They then spend the rest of the film making inane jokes aimed at those critics of the Iraq war incorporating stunning political inaccuracies and not so subtle pro Bush cheerleading.  <br /> <br />For those many still in denial over the reprehensible Bush Administration's crimes on the Iraq war (and other vital issues) or do not believe that propaganda is a fundamental force in the USA (and also not a conspiracy), I'd recommend Control Room and \\"Uncovered - The Whole Truth About the Iraq War\\", the award winning DVD \\"Manufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky and the Media\\" and \\"The Corporation\\" (which overall, though tragic, is much funnier than \\"Team America\\").  <br />
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I went to see Pride and Prejudice not having that high of expectations coming from a lesser known studio, but it blew them away! This may not be the best movie ever made from this Jane Austen classic, but it is a strong retelling of the story.<br /><br />Keira Knightley steals the show and rightly was nominated for an Oscar for her leading role.The chemistry between her and Matthew Macfayden works well. Although the movie starts off slow it picks up as Mr. Darcy enters the screen and takes you on a wonderful journey. My wife and I loved this one and it's always good to find a great chick flick to go to with your wife!
B000001FDK|5.0|Nearly thirty years later, this movie is still a hit in my home!  When I was very young, Grease was one of the most fun, exciting, romantic movies I had ever seen.  I collected the cards, adored Danny, knew, sang, and danced to every song - you remember doing the same, don't you?  I bought the DVD and Soundtrack and, wouldn't you know it, my boys got hooked!  On the way to school, my 1st, 5th, and 7th graders and I are singing our hearts out!   <br /> <br />It's so much fun for the family!  To captivate an audience, from one generation to the next - what an awesome feat!  <br /> <br />
B000E8QVWY|3.0|While Reese Witherspoon was delightful I found Joaquin Phoenix to be one dimensional and boring. I didn't care for the movie at all.
B00002E23E|5.0|I couldn't stand that horrifying stairway to heavun blurp in the original screen play and VHS,I had my hand on the clicker in anticipation.The VHS version the chore of FF-ing.

B000003MZU|5.0|I have just started to learn to dance salsa and other Latin dances.  To improve, it is important to learn about the various types of music and the timing when learning new dances.  I have asked many people what groups and CDs I should purchase to expand my knowledge of Latin dance music.  Invariably, they recommend Juan Luis Guerra and specifically, Bachata Rosa.  This CD is accessible to people who are new to Latin music.  In addition, there are various tempos and styles of music on this CD, from salsa to bachata.  I highly recommend this CD to novice and experienced Salseros, and anyone who is interested in experiencing Latin music.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series, undeserving to be shown on TV as a 'series'. The storyline is genius and the actors are perfect for their parts.

0393327655|2.0|I got this book and read it.  I'm a frequent critic of religion.  However, this amazon.com review is very scared of the Muslim religion which has a nasty modern habit of killing the critics.  Modern Christians, for most purposes, are almost ineffective in guarding their religion against corruption.  I wish the readers on this page would look at what a gay writer, Bruce Bawer, says about Islam in the book \\"While Europe Slept\\". <br /> <br />Anyway, the writer should have made an in debth study of the one place in the world with no religion.  That is traditional Europe.  Traditional Europe has only 5% Christian church attendance.   <br /> <br />What has been the results of that? <br /> <br />Well, something in the civilization dies.  Traditional Germans, French, Dutch, and the rest of Western Europe has a birth rate of less than 1.1 per couple.  That is not enough children to replace the populace.  It's like the society quits caring.  It sort of reminds this reviewer of the effects in the Arthur C. Clarke Novel \\"Childhood's end\\".  The adults just quit caring and society dies.  If Western Civilization must continue to grow then people have to believe in something greater than themselves.  Judging from the effects in Europe, perhaps there is something to that logic.  Religion can't be all bad.  <br /> <br />My point is there must be something for religion.  It's not all bad.  Didn't Christanity force the USA to stomp out slavery in the 1860s?  Didn't Christanity try to save this nation's childrens from the problems of constant alcohol drinking in the late 1800s?  Didn't Christanity make allies with people of color and try to improve their civil rights in the 1960s. <br /> <br />I worry about pure athiesm.  Why?  It's social darwinism.  Pure social darwinism gets you Stalin and Mao.  Both individuals made Hitler look like a piker.   <br /> <br />But this book isn't totally bad.  Nothing is like picking on the double standards in religion.   <br /> <br />I give the book two stars.  It's not bad.  I think it's a little misguided.  Islam is the threat, not the little old Christian ladies going to Catholic mass on a Sunday morning.

B000002BHE|5.0|This album introduced me to Celine Dion. That day I purchased the album, I was supposed to get Mariah Carey's 'Daydream' but the retailer said they ran out of copies, so I picked this album instead--and boy, I was in for a surprise! I ended buying more copies of Celine's because I enjoyed it so much. From then on, I became a Celine fan, and I can say that 'Falling Into You' is her most definitive work--focused, poised, powerful and solid. This album displays Celine's vocals in top form. <br /> <br />My favorite moments from the album: there are 2 epics in the album, and svengali producer Jim Steinman helmed these: 'It's All Coming Back To Me Now' and 'Call The Man' in which Celine plays storyteller of love forgotten and weary souls amidst an amazing backdrop of instrumentation, singing with so much emotion and gusto! 'Declaration of Love' and 'River Deep Mountain High' may seem like cheesy over the top diva-uptempos but these ditties are so irresistible that you'll be singing at the top of your lungs in no time. 'Fly' is wrenching and touching ballad dedicated to Celine's niece who died of cystic fibrosis. The song is so ethereal, surreal and poignant you'll be reaching for the tissues. My ultimate favorite is the subtle 'If That's What It Takes', the simplest and honest song Celine made for the set. Others may disregard the song, but I think is my diamond in the rough. I highly recommend this album to pop music lovers. This album didnt win the Album of the Year at the Grammy's for no reason! Pick this up and fall in love with Celine.
0060765496|5.0|The Lion, The Witcha and The Wardrobe <br />By:C.S. Lewis <br />Reviewed by:R.Ajoc <br />Period: 1 <br /> <br />The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best book that Clive Staples Lewis has created. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is about Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund in their guardians home because of war in thier homeland. One day as their playing hide and seek, Lucy hides in a giant wardrobe and stumbles into a mysterious land that her friend, Mr. Tumnus calls Narnia. Lucy is very astonished that she has found this new fantasy world inside of her guardian, Professor Kirke. Lucy tries to tell everyone yet no one believes anything that lucy says. Then Edmund, the bratty one in the family happens to also find Narnia, Edmund being the brat that he is tells everyone, and no one believes him. Then all of them go into the wardrobe for the first time and nothing happenes, then tries later thier in the snowy world of Narnia, and they all see Mr. Tumnus, as sneaky Edmund runs off with the white witch. Now the others Lucy, Susan, and Peter must find the White  Witch and defeat her with the mighty lion, Aslan. <br />      The whole plot of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is to start of the real beggining of The Chronicles of Narnia. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is my favorite book. C.S. Lewis starts off the great fantasy world, Narnia with a great hit. Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe has already been created into a movie. The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is my favorite book because it features many scenes while you read where you can just sink into and get lost in, especially the part during the war.  <br />      This book is a very good book, although I am not a very big fan of fantasy books but Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best fantasy book I have ever read and probably the one and only best book in the series. This book is special because of the way you feel as you read it, it is as if your actually in the fantasy world of Narnia as your reading, like your running right behind Aslan as you run, or like your on flying on a dragon, such as on Dragon Rider. The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is one of the best fantasy books to have hit book shelves.  <br />      My favorite part of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is during the end when there is a big battle for who will win the land of Narnia The White Witch or Aslan, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. This part took alot of imagination, and it really helps you picture the war in your head. As Aslan revivies from the brutal killing ceremony from The White Witch Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund are surprised to see that Aslan is still alive. This part of the story showed that you can never die, your body may die but your soul lives on. Aslan's role in this part of the story is very strong, you can feel that C.S. Lewis is trying to send you messages in a fantasy book, while your using your imagination and thinking of how the story is going on in your head. <br />
B000000WCA|5.0|With all the girl bands that are popping out in the scene from the Pussycat Dolls to Destiny's Child, no one could quite ever fill the shoes of the Spice Girls. The Spice Girls were different--they were a character--full of life, vibrant and most of all fun without all the gloss and pretense. They are naturally sexy, entertaining and appealing. The Spice Girls burst into the scene with 'Spice' a collection of 10 devilish pop ditties that's packed with punch and rhythm that's hard to resist.  <br /> <br />All the songs from the album couldve been #1 if they were released. Aside from the 4 singles released, the original 'Hollaback Girl', 'Wannabe', the ultra-sexy groove of 'Say You'll Be There', the lush ballad '2 Become 1' and the double a-side 'Mama/Who Do You Think You Are', 'Love Thing' and 'Naked' couldve easily become hits--these songs were even released to radio (not commericially) in some parts of the world and became hits! 'If U Cant Dance' is floorfiller, while 'Something Kinda Funny' just oozes with sex appeal and good melody. After more than 10 years of release it goes to say that 'SPICE' still sounds fierce today as it was. I recommend this album to everyone -- the perfect soundtrack to youth and fun! 20 million people can't be wrong.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|This is one of the best screwball comedies I have ever seen. Cary Grant was hilarious and Katharine Hepburn. Well, what can you say about Katharine Hepburn that hasn't being said before, she was great. She was fabulous in this movie, great to look at, her acting was excellent on a scale of 1 to 10, her acting was an 11. I don't want to give away the ending, but this movie is a sure buy. I love it, anyone who like screwball comedies or just great movies will look it too.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I feel this is the best DVD Season for Gilmore Girls.  It shows how Rory is starting to mature and take lot of chances.  I think every teenage adult goes through this and I feel they played it perfectly!  I can't wait for Season 6 to come out.  I also like how they brought another guy into Rory's life which is Logan (Matt Czuchry) who plays his part perfectly!  I give this season an A+++
1400032717|5.0|After working with adults diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorders for more than 2 decades, I have gained an excellent understanding of their unique and amazing way of thinking.  Mark Haddon's book is SO accurate that I wish it had been part of my university curriculum.  Indeed, I have decided as a college instructor to add it to my syllabus. <br /> <br />If this book was just an accurate depiction of the inner workings of a 15 year old boy with Asperger's Syndrome, it would be good.  But this book is great!  It is a book which makes you question our entire view of the world, from theology to morality.  Equally important, it is fun, interesting, engaging and easy to read.   <br /> <br />Good luck trying to understand the math problem at the end though... <br /> <br />
0977326403|3.0|This monograph is a variant of the very fine book Good to Great. However, in the 35 pages of text, diagrams and tables, the reality becomes clear that for-profits and nonprofits are both organizations. Many of the same dynamics are at work in each type of entity. And as could also be said of Collin's earlier work, while a guide to being great is fine, many organizations would benefit greatly if they just started by being better.
B000002AD0|4.0|Let's start with the obvious.  Michael Shrieve isn't in the band yet, so the concert isn't anything close to future Santana standards.  However, this live album shows you how it all got started.  This is the bare bones, the raw Santana.  Santana had just signed on with Columbia Records when they played this concert.  Obviously, the formula hasn't been perfected yet, but this is the starting point, the beginning of what would be a future rock and roll phenomenon.   <br />The first disc starts off strong with a long version of Jingo.  Persuasion follows with a hard rock intro, pretty cool.  Treat is beautifully played here, with Gregg Rolie pounding on the piano keys like there's no tomorrow. All the other songs on this disc are great as well. <br />Disc two has a 14 minute Soul Sacrifice.  It's not anything close to the Woodstock version, but this one is good too, with a great organ solo by Gregg Rolie.  As The Years Go By is a great blues song, and finishing things up is Freeway, a 30 minute jam that rocks hard all the way through. <br />You might be hesitant to get this album because it's a Santana that is young, barely starting out.  But the truth is, there's no such thing as a bad Santana concert.  Get Santana Live at the Fillmore 1968, it's a great slice of time, with great music to have you jammin' all night. <br /> <br />**If you want to hear THE Santana concert, pick up Santana III Legacy Edition.  It contains the REAL band's whole concert on the closing night of the Fillmore West in 1971.  Great music with great musicianship.  You can't beat it.

Hal Moore told Dan Rather, when asked what was the one thing he hoped America would learn from his film, \\"We Were Soldiers\\".<br /><br />This book should be required reading for every American high school student and immigrant seeking US citizenship. It is the untold story of America's heros.  A generation of heroes who were disowned by their own country in the Vietnam era.<br /><br />Buy several DVD's to pass along as gifts to the next generation.

0385513755|1.0|When this book was touted to me by so many of my people and clients, ( I am a professional Astrologer, and have a degree in Greek and roman Archaeology) I was first replused by the incorrect use of the name of the great Leonardo Da Vinci.  He is always referred to as \\"Leonardo\\" and never, never by scholars or historians by his surname.  This showed me in the title alone, that the author was no scholar, or even one who knew the basic tenets of culture, art history, or correct writing practices.<br /><br />Secondly, upon reading the  book, it was poorly, very sloppily written.  This also rates it in the lowest comparison to the superb and fascinatingly executed, \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\"<br /><br />Thirdly, Mr Brown's lack of reference to the above mentioned treatise was unforgivable.  I found the Da Vinci Code to be a travesity from begiining to end.  The impact it had on the public was most interesting, though, showing once again, that a vulgar parable on a great work, is all that the masses can absorb.  It is quite conceivable that \\"Holy Blood Holy Grail\\" would be far too advanced in scholarly richness, dense and thorough history, and esoteric knowledge of the early church to appeal to conteporary readers.  The only star I would give to the DVC is that its truth, albiet stolen truth, has penetrated the hunger that the world does have for real information.<br /><br />I am quite intriged by the current London trial accusing Dan Brown of much of what I have said here, and for the past four years.  He owes everything to the authors of \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" and should pay much to them for the exhausting amount of research and pain they suffered in the making of their book. Finally, D Brown should apologize for the vile ineptitude of his writing.  All who have fallen for this story should apologize to Mary herself for using a tabloid like DVC to find out her legacy.
0735619670|5.0|Code Complete by Steve McConnell is the convergence (the crossroads) of experience, research, and theory. This book is invaluable, the Holy Grail of programming reference books. McConnell's writing style is clear, concise, easy to understand and often humorous.<br /><br />Programmers on every level (from introduction to master) will benefit from reading this book. Programmers at the introduction level may find some topics advanced, but references to additional resources are close at hand. This book covers a broad range of interconnected topics ranging from: variable names, code-tuning, personal character, managing your manager, gonzo programming and much more. The emphasis is always on successful software design techniques.<br /><br />McConnell doesn't shy away from presenting hard data and details; he nails the \\"whys\\" that so many other texts avoid.<br /><br />Selected quotes from Code Complete:<br /><br />\\"People have already made all the mistakes that you're making now, and unless you're a glutton for punishment, you'll prefer reading their books and avoiding their mistakes to inventing new versions of old problems.\\" (Chapter 35)<br /><br />\\"Once a programmer realizes that programming principles transcend the syntax of any specific language, the doors swing open to knowledge that truly makes a difference in quality and productivity.\\" (Preface)<br /><br />\\"The value of hands-on experience as compared to book learning is smaller in software development than in many other fields\\" (Chapter 35)<br /><br />It's interesting to note that Code Complete is a required read to become a practitioner (intermediate) level employee in McConnell's company (Construx).<br /><br />Code Complete is often compared with [[ASIN:020161622X The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master [Hunt, Andrew, and Thomas, David]]]; the topics covered in the Pragmatic Programmer are a small subset of Code Complete. Code Complete is consistently written at a higher level, and offers more references for continual research and professional development. But don't take my word for it; read both, the [[ASIN:020161622X Pragmatic Programmer]] makes a good prerequisite to Code Complete.<br /><br />Hailing this book as \\"The Holy Grail of programming references\\" may seem fanatical, but I have yet to find a book that remotely measures up to Code Complete.on't take my word for it; read both, the [[ASIN:020161622X Pragmatic Programmer]] makes a good prerequisite to Code Complete.

B0002Y4TOM|5.0|When I heard about teen pregnancy, all the teenage girls are learning what would Lorelai Gilmore will do. Rory is kind of a girl, moms would of approve of. I know some episodes Logan's family disapproved her, in real life a lot of parents would love to have Rory dating their sons and marrying them. I read about Cindy Crawford, I never knew she grew up as Rory Gilmore herself too, her mother was a Lorelai Gilmore too and she grew up in DeKalb, it that was like Stars Hollow back then.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|First of all let me say I really wanted to like PJ's KK.  It saddens me to say this thing was just overdone in every conceivable way.  NY opening, boat trip, Skull Island, Back to NY...all way too long.  Dinosaur fight scenes go on forever (and why did Jackson think three T-Rexes would be better than one??? because they ain't).  Spider-pit scene is just plain gross and, once again, goes on too long.  This film suffers what I'm calling the 'Matrix' effect.  Like the Matrix sequels what would have made a decent, no more than 2hr film, becomes an overlong snoozer.  Give a director creative carte blanche and a blank check and you get an overblown mess. Someone should have made Jackson deliver a movie an hour shorter.  Save the version I was subjected to theatrically for the 4 disc DVD you know is coming in time for Christmas this year.
B00003CXA4|5.0|Excellent portrayal of one of the world's greatest men.  From all I can personally remember, it is very historically accurate, and, in addition to the main character, the supporting actors and actresses accurately represent their screen personi.  Not a short film, but when it was over, one was left with the feeling that they would like to have seen much more.  In our family, my wife was so enthralled with the film that she has checked out several books on Gandhi from our library in order to find out more about the man. All school students of almost any age should have this film as a required viewing subject.
B000BM3ZUE|4.0|Track 6 (The Moon is Down) has a mastering defect at approximately 2:39 into the song. To me, it sounds like an output level spike.  <br /> <br />Since I've been a huge GG fan since the early 70's, I will continue to buy the remasters as the technology improves. I just don't understand why Repertoire and DRT (Interview) distributed these without anyone initially catching the defects. <br /> <br />I am rating this 4 stars because the entire CD (except or track 6) is fabulous. It's interesting to hear their style develop and expand on each early record. Ray Shulman recently said that this was his favorite GG recording.  <br /> <br />Also, Phil Shulman's excellent vocal contributions on the early stuff, through Octopus, provided a perfect balance to Derek and Kerry.

1573223085|3.0|First the Good. <br />The book is easy to read, well written, thought provoking.  It presents a useful, simple overview of the left brain/right brain model.  And it contains a concise analysis of the dilemma facing knowledge workers in America today: Abundance, Asia, and Automation.  Abundance of stuff means that products and people must compete more on hard-to-define, right-brain qualities like beauty, coolness, and meaning.  Abundance is produced by cheap foreign labor (Asia) and increasingly sophisticated machines to do the boring left-brain work (Automation).  And the last half of the book presents a pretty good way to get started on developing your right brain abilities.  That's the Good. <br /> <br />Next the Bad. <br />The solution the book presents, that Right-brain or even whole-brain thinking, will save our jobs in the face of the three A's, is unsupported and implausible.  It may save your job (in fact it may be your only viable option), and it may even save a great many American jobs, but is it the salvation for the American economy?  I think not.  Mr. Pink is guilty, I think, of what he would call a left brain failure: missing the big picture.  Or you could just call it wishful thinking of the sort that fostered the 90's stock market boom and crash.  America's abundance is an illusion that can be maintained only as long as foreign lenders are willing to extend us credit.  Our Conceptual products are selling to the world but they aren't narrowing our trade deficit and there is no evidence that they ever will.  Can we really become largely a nation of concept producers and traders without a foundation in anything physical and real?  And even if we could, what is to keep Asia and Automation from eating into our advantage there too?  And how many design choices do we need -- aren't we already to the point of being psychically overwhelmed by the Abundance of choices?  And how many designers do we need anyway -- not so very many to judge by the contents of our big-box stores and how those contents are pretty much the same everywhere. <br /> <br />Finally, the Ugly. <br />It's the bigger big picture.  The Abundance that we have experienced so far is very dependent on cheap energy, mainly in the form of oil.  The world is running out of cheap oil so the whole basis of the 3 A's is undermined.  Worse than even that, scientists say, that by burning that oil and other short-sighted actions, we are changing the world climate in ways that will become drastic and unpredictable, but generally bad for food production, etc.  Bye bye Abundance.  Hello scarcity. <br /> <br />We can only hope that our new-found Right brain abilities will help us to overcome or at least survive the planetary mess we have made for ourselves and our children.  Heck, it would be a major step forward if it just helped a majority of us to recognize the problem.  But somehow I doubt that the kind of Right-brain thinking that gave us designer toilet brushes is going do the trick.  And the kind of Right-brain thinking that leads some of us to believe in Stories of Rapture and Anti-christs -- well, that's not helping much either, is it? <br /> <br />We may gotten into this mess with mainly our Left-brains but it's pretty clear to me that we will need our Whole Minds to have any hope of getting through it.

0399152717|4.0|Generally Clive Cussler books have gone downhill for the last 20 years or so.  They now seemed to be aimed at 14 year olds rather than adults and the writing style is appropriate for that market.  This is a shame as books such as Night Probe were really outstsnding. <br /> <br />I started to read this book yesterday on a long flight and so far it has gripped me more than most of the Cussler Franchise output of late.  Could this be because Paul Kemprecos is actually a better writer?

B00005JOUM|5.0|\\"My name is Dalton Russell. Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself.\\"<br /><br />It is so great to go to a movie and have it fulfill high expectations for one.  The trailer and the television commercials for \\"Inside Man\\" piqued my curiosity, and since Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster signed on, and Spike Lee ended up directing the movie, I decided I had to go see the first showing the first day do that I could find out what exactly is the game going on with this bank robbery that is not a bank robbery.  I figured that armed with the idea that the perfect crime is the one that you do not know has been committed,<br /><br />Dalton Russell (Owen), the man who came up with this perfect crime, might not repeat himself, but the words he speaks into the camera at the beginning of the film are repeated when the revelation comes and you see the total audacity of his plan.  This is one of those movies where somebody tells you what they are doing and it does not matter because you are probably not going to figure it out (okay, some people will, but they are either smarter than me or we are talking the old saying about blind hogs).  Detective Keith Frazier (Washington), is in the hostage negotiator in charge, with fellow Detective Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor), at his side.  The bank in question belongs to Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) and clearly the last thing he is worried about is the money that is there.  So he contacts Madeliene White (Foster), who has always been the sort of woman who arranges thing for a nice but not necessarily small fee.<br /><br />It takes Frazier a while to catch on that the guy in charge inside the bank is the smartest one in the game (or, at the very least, he has all of the angles figured out).  Certainly when White comes away from her face-to-face with the masked man in the bank she knows that this guy is so far ahead of her she is never going to catch up.  But a key thing here is that these are smart people, capable of making mistakes but also able to make the necessary connections that lead to explaining what the hell is going on here.  Also, it was nice to see that the cops in this film were pretty competent for the most part, from the first cop on the scene to Captain Darius (Willem Dafoe), who is in charge of the tactical part of the operation.  I was wondering if this might be post-9/11 good will, but actually it is necessary for the film to work: the cops have to be competent.  The whole point is to beat them at their best.<br /><br />The screenplay is written by Russell Gewirtz, and since this is his first filmed script he is either going to be one of the hottest scribes in Hollywood or he is going to spend the rest of his life trying to prove this one is no fluke.  I think Spike Lee had a hand in some of the bits, simply because there are so few moments where \\"Inside Man\\" seems like a Spike Lee Joint and you remember who is directing this one (admit it: you were surprised this was a 40 Acres and Mule film).  Things really move in this one and you never get the sense of it being a drawn out hostage crisis.  Besides, it is also a way of not giving you time to figure out what is going on.  Even when we get flashforwards to Frazier and Mitchell interviewing the hostages (or are they the criminals?), the film is not doing us any real favors.<br /><br />Of course you want to try and figure out what is going on, because that is part of the fun.  As soon as \\"Chaiyya Chaiyya\\" starts playing I am trying to figure out what sort of clue this song from the \\"Bombay Dreams\\" cast album has to do with the story.  But Gewirtz is to us as Dalton is to the police; there is a point early one when you turn to each other and think you have spotted a key clue (off of the \\"Ten Little Indians\\" rule that if you do not see something, then it did not happen).  But this is just one of several insidious red herrings, some of which are brilliantly putin the commercials.  Afterwards if you stop and think about it you can find minor flaws in the story, but that is true of any such story.  When the last act begins I leapt to a correct conclusion, which got me thinking that when Frazier completed his interviews he would come to the same conclusion, albeit by a different method.  Even so, I seriously doubt that you will be disappointed by the way this one plays out.<br /><br />There are a few moments when Lee gets a bit cute with what he is doing (e.g., Denzel on a moving platform), but he is allowed to indulge.  Washington makes wearing a hat look good again and while the character Owen plays requires him to do the same sort of barely modulated monotone he always seems to be doing it is Foster who has the most fun playing a role without a scintilla of the vulnerability that are her trademark and reminding us there is a level beyond the b-word.  She has the cold smile of a snake down pretty good.  Final Note: As usual I was the only one who stuck around for all of the credits, but the totally addictive opening song comes back at the end, this time as a \\"Chaiyya Chaiyya Bollywood Joint\\" variation.  Since I still had ice left in my drink, I was able to shake it as an impromptu percussion instrument, but I still have no clue as to what it signifies for the movie.you stop and think about it you can find minor flaws in the story, but that is true of any such story.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this movie. I admit that I have not read the book yet, and therefore cant judge the authenticity of this movie from that aspect. But as an 'ardent' fan of the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehrle miniseries version I was skeptical that I would enjoy this abbreviated one. However, I was so thrilled that the Bennett family are portrayed as such a vibrant and close-knit family with more \\"country\\" roots than we are shown in that other version. Even their house, shown as less pristine, makes sense for a middle class home in the country. The girls show more of the natural feelings that a young single woman would feel even at that time, or maybe more so since marriage was the goal of their 'occupation'. Even a sensible girl would be giddy over a handsome man. I enjoyed that Mr. Bennett was endeared to all his daughters and even to his wife more in this movie. It was a joy to see this classic love story told from a new angle. <br />
0895260131|4.0|This book deserves its four stars.  It is insightful, has many darn scary quotes from the Koran, and shows the double standards the Media and Islam uses to defend this very backwards religion. <br /> <br />This poster thinks this book should be given to every Catholic and Lutheran School.  Why?  The great religious reformer, Martin Luther, saw that Islam was a far larger threat to Western Civilisation than anything ever made.  Luther wanted all of Christianity to unite and expel the Muslims from Europe.     <br /> <br />The book has a quote and warning from Winston Churchill.  Churchill saw the religion as something all corrupting and controlling, worse than NAZI Germany.  What made the Nazis a bigger threat to Western Civilization was the Germans could actually work hard and had great intellect.  Islam is like tooth decay.  What it attacks becomes spoilt, rotten, and worthless.  It can't be changed and must be cut out to stop it. <br /> <br />This book is broken down into easy to read chapters.  The myth of the Crusades is debunked.  If there had been no Crusades there would have been no modern Europe.  The book explains that women will lose any feminist rights they have, could be subject to beatings, and their daughters forced to undergo female circumcise.  Other chapters explain how Islam exterminates homosexuals but some of the powerful Islamic rulers live as they wish, a perversion of the golden rule; he with the gold makes the rules.   <br /> <br />Now, this book is PG-13 rated.  It does not go into bloody details of the problems with Islam.  Furthermore, it's a light read.  I was able to knock out the book in nearly one evening. <br /> <br />There are many better books on the subject.  The best of the lot is \\"While Europe Slept\\".  Bruce Bawer writes of how the area of Europe is dying in real time.  Also, another book, \\"The Menace in Europe\\" simply gives reasons why Europe will be known as \\"Eurobania\\" by about 2050. <br /> <br />Christians, Moderates, Lesbians, Gays, and Atheists should know that Islam considers non-believers \\"dhimmi\\", basically third rate citizens.  \\"Dhimmi\\" is related to our word \\"diminished\\".  Look at how the nation of Afghanistan wants to execute the convert to Christianity.  That is the true face of Islam. <br /> <br />If a non-Muslim reads this book they will be quickly educated on the evils of that religion.  Note, when Islam hits over 8% of a nation they demand religious law to governed their people.  All non-Muslim people lose their rights.  You are seeing this process in real time in Europe.  Canada will follow suit by 2015.  It's doubtful that America will ever be dominated by Sharia law; the Second Amendment and good Christians are still powerful here are will be so at least until 2030. <br /> <br />I recommend this book.  Yes, I will receive non-helpful votes from Muslims.  They don't want you to know the truth.
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|There is great computer animation...there is great classic Disney...and there is \\"Chicken Little\\", which is far from a great example of either. This weird update of an ancient fable is graced (?) by some of the clunkiest-looking characters I've ever seen, overwrought dialogue that hits both kids and parents over the head, and incredibly cheesy action effects that resemble purposely-bad sci-fi. Add some loud, annoying voice work and dumbed-down '70s music references, and you've got something that's just a few feathers short of being an empty nest. <br />     Chicken Little looks like nothing so much as a geeky, gabby golf ball with grotesque green glasses, and his self-esteem issues are contrived. Plus, he's voiced with a bad Bronx accent by \\"Scrubs\\"' screwball doctor, Zach Braff. His dad, a/k/a Buck Cluck, is a beefy bird voiced with an even worse accent by, of all people, comedy writer/director Garry Marshall. I didn't see a bird father and son here, but a noisy New York sitcom. And the other characters are just as annoying. I mean, what's so funny about a 500-pound pig that keeps quoting '60s pop tunes out of context?  <br />       The animators say they were trying to update classic Disney cartoons, but it looked more like a bad Muppet show to me, especially during the all-animal baseball game sequence. The later alien invasion climax? Don't ask. OK, it looked and sounded like a cheap video game, and threw in an ironic R.E.M. rocker as happy background music. These people either have a really warped sense of humor and off-the-track sense of timing, or they're trying to add a post-modern flavor to what could, and should, have been a cute kids' movie in better hands. <br />       About the only things I saw that rose above the spacy murk of this movie were the two-minute \\"Hollywood version\\" of \\"Chicken Little\\" at the very end- and, yes, that was Adam West as the voice of the \\"Super Chicken\\"- and a deleted opening sequence that gave the original fable a charming, old-school Disney flavor. This bit was narrated by the late Don Knotts, who also voices the dimwitted Mayor Turkey. Boy, did he deserve a better swan song. <br />       In the last decade, we've all been spoiled by the brilliant work from Pixar and the broader, but still witty at times, DreamWorks movies. \\"Chicken Little\\" will probably satisfy kids who'll watch anything animated and parents who won't criticize them. But to these eyes, it's just a soft-boiled egg.
B00000F169|3.0|I'll be blunt.  If you're younger than 35 you will not like this movie.  The effects are crude.  The dialog is forced.  The acting is what you'll find in a high school play.   <br /> <br />Now, I like this movie.  This movie came out when finding a good science fiction movie in the early '70s was near impossible.  This movie came out 4 years after Star Trek died and it would be another 3 years until Star Wars.  You took what you could get in space adventure and this was it. <br /> <br />The plot of Dark Star is simple; she must make star systems safe for future human inhabitants by clearing unstable planets.  A crew is sent from earth on a multi-year mission. They go a little insane on the way.  Much of the interaction of the crew is based off this sheer boredom with one another.  Note, this movie was made long before women were astronauts.  So, the makers of this movie thought future exploration of space would keep the single sex theme.  With no women and not being homosexual the men go mad with boredom. <br /> <br />One of the planet destroying bombs gets a fault by some static electrictiy from a passing asteroid.  The bomb starts thinking it's in a count down mode to destruction.  Eventually, the bomb wrecks the ship.  However, the crew isn't killed. <br /> <br />One of the members the ship gets a piece of wreckage and surfs it to reentry on a close by planet.  He falls off the board and wipes out... cool.  The movie ends. <br /> <br />Get the movie on discount.  It's a solid three stars. <br /> <br />If you're less than 35 you'll hate this movie.  That is a fact.
0307276902|3.0|i recedived this book months ago and still have not read more than 20 pgs.  the controversy surrounding this book has had something to do with it.
B00062IDCO|5.0|I am a very avid \\"Star Trek\\"  fan, and find the DVD's very worthwhile and interesting. ( My Star Trek interests go back to the original series with William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy,  James  <br />Doohan, et. al.)
B0006IIPJ4|4.0|In Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Director Kerry Conran uses CGI to take us back to the film world of 1939, modeling the action, plot and techology after the Grade B flicks of the time. A P-40 aircraft is specially modified to go under water (shades of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang) and is remarkably a two-seater plane, which is an historical anachronism. <br /> <br />Intrepid New York City reporter Polly Perkins, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is hot on the story of the disappearance of several scientists when an army of robots and flying machines attacks New york. Sky Captain Joe Sullivan, played by Jude Law comes to the rescue. <br /> <br />He and Perkins hook up and it seems they have a history. There's an undercurrent of romantic tension but nothing that is inappropriate for kids. They don't even kiss during the movie, although several times it seems as though they will. <br /> <br />Giovanni Ribisi plays a technical expert, Dex, who is kidnapped by the enemy when Sky Captain's base is attacked. Polly and Sky Captain set off in pursuit of the baddies, stopping along the way to get some help from British commander \\"Frankie\\", played by Angelina Jolie and with whom Sky Captain also has a past. <br /> <br />Sky Captain and Polly end up in Nepal where they find the lost city of Shangri-La and discover that the mad scientist is building a space ship ark because he believes earth is doomed and he wants to save the creatures of the world. (there's a really funny visual of a cow in a space capsule!) However, if the spaceship blasts off, it will destroy the earth. <br /> <br />Sky Captain and Polly meet up again with Dex and find the missing scientists. Along the way there is a lot of humourous dialogue between the three of them, and several tributes to other movies such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and The Empire Strikes Back. <br /> <br />This is not a movie to be taken seriously. It's as though an old Buck Rogers movie has been restored to pristine condition, complete with ray guns, although surprisingly these ray guns actually destroy the robots so the movie has to employ various ploys to deprive Sky Captain of his ray gun. <br /> <br />My family and I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie and making fun of the anachronisms, the spurious plot devices and the dialogue. This is not meant to disparage the movie because all of these are intentional on the part of the director. Don't take the movie seriously, just watch it and have fun! <br /> <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|The first time I heard \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" on the radio, I was immediately drawn to buy this album.  I listened to the entire CD and was not disappointed.  Keane's music can evoke the deepest emotion.  You \\"feel\\" each song.  I can't say that about many albums I've purchased, and rarely do I spend the money to buy an album for one song.  I can't say enough about this album and about Keane.  Songs I'd recommend...all of them.  Keane is amazing and if you're not sure about this album, they are well worth the listen.  Give Keane a try and I guarentee you'll be seduced by their hypnotic sound just like I have.
0307276902|1.0|I read this book knowing hat parts of it were \\"embellished.\\"  I just could not get into this book.  I didn't know what to believe - parts of it were raw and pretty unbelivable.  As a result I did not enjoy this book.
0425170349|5.0|I'll be brief:  If you liked Without Remorse, you'll like Rainbox 6.  In my honest opinion they're two of Tom's best works.  They both focus on John Clark, rather than Jack Ryan.  I love the Jack Ryan books too, dont' get me wrong, but the Clark (or Kelly, depending on which book  you read first) character is so deep.  Jack Ryan gets into a lot of stuff and gets lucky quite often.  John Clark doesn't take unnecessary risks, and those he does take he executes with ruthless precision :)  Kind of blowing it out of proportion a bit, but trust me, any fan of Jack Ryan is a fan of John Clark.  They stand for the same things, its just John's earlier years were....well, quite interesting for those who haven't read the previous book.  Pick'em both up and you won't sleep for a month, because once you've read'em both you'll want to go back and re-read all the previous novels looking for hints of Clark and paying more attention to his parts.
B00011RPB0|4.0|I've never been to Tokyo, so I can't say if what this movie projected about life there is true and to what extent. I liked the plot of the movie, inspite of it being quite predictible, the background score's good and amazing performances by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. I liked the movie, give it a short if you wanna go for a slow movie..
1400034779|1.0|I do not understand why this book is so popular.  I am about 1/2 way through it and I am still waiting for it to catch my attention.  It is such a struggle!  I feel like I have to force myself to finish it because it just doesn't seem to have a plot or any sort of big story that draws me in.  Maybe I am just missing some major appeal, but I would save my money and buy some other book instead.
0895260131|5.0|This was a great book.  I enjoyed the well written, occasionally humorous text, and the references were well presented.  I strongly recommend that all people who believe in Western Civilization read it.  Read it to your children, too, to counter the PC claptrap they get in public schools.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't watch TV much, so I had never heard of Firefly until years after its cancellation.  A friend brought the DVD set over and we watched them, and I was hooked by the second episode.  The writing and dialogue is typical of Joss Whedon's work - that is, well above par for the industry.  Somehow managing to combine the serious with the lighthearted, Firefly alternately makes you worry for the characters and laugh aloud.  Look for Alan Tudyk and Adam Baldwin's performances in particular to bring life to their respective characters! <br /> <br />It was a terrible loss for all of us that Fox Television never gave this series the credit it deserved.  By failing to publicize it adequately, showing the series out of order, throwing out the 2-hour pilot episode (and forcing the writers to create a new pilot over the course of a single weekend), airing the show in one of the worst time-slots available, and frequent pre-empting the show in favor of baseball are the ONLY reasons this show was not a *huge* hit.  People who watch it even once fall immediately in love with the characters and the concept - ordinary people just trying to get by in a world (okay, a series of worlds) while caught between a corrupt government on one side and a savage cannibalistic enemy on the other.  (The existence of the bloodthirsty Reavers is fully explained in the follup feature film, Serenity.)  One particularly cool thing is that the series does NOT have sound effects in airless space!  A missile fired at the ship in space glides by in absolute silence, and when it detonates off the bow, you rightly hear it only when the POV is *inside* the ship, as the explosion and shrapnel pepper the hull.  Furthermore, there are no aliens (especially bipedal, bi-brachial aliens with five fingers on each hand, two eyes, two ears, a nose and a mouth in exactly the same configuration as a human) - making this one of the more plausible sci-fi offerings ever. <br /> <br />This is an intelligent show.  For those of us who were insulted by re-released versions of Star Wars which include Greedo shooting first (and somehow missing a stationary target at point blank), not to mention Ewoks and Jar-Jar - THIS is the sci-fi show we've been waiting for.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I first saw The Straight Story in a film class last year.  I am a fan of David Lynch and was surprised not to have heard of the film.  What I expected and what I got were too very different things.  Normally Lynch is known for challenging the viewers sense of reality and normality, Eraserhead challenged the conception of family and fatherhood.  The Straight Story seems to be an American validation of these things.   <br /> <br />The Straight Story is a very touching film about an aging man, Straight, who recieved news that his estranged brother had a stroke and may be in his final days.  Being self-sustaining, but having the eyesight of a bat, Straight is forced to pack up a trailer, attach it to a riding lawnmover, and drive several states to visit his brother before it is too late.   <br /> <br />The real power of the film is in its pacing, the people and stories Straight meets along the way, and the beauty of the American heartland.  He emparts a lifetime worth of wisdom to people who need it, and is able to reflect and come to peace with his own life.   <br /> <br />I found Straight to embody something about the American cowboy still alive today.  He wants his autonomy andto blaze his own trail.  Through his slow travel he is able to soak in his surroundings in the way that a person on horseback can.  He throughly believes in honor, family, brotherhood, paying your own way, and that anyone you meet can be a trusted friend.  A man with stubborn grit and heart.   <br /> <br />Great film.  Great male lead by Richard Farmsworth.  Great supporting roles such as Sissy Spacek.  Great Direction by David Lynch.
B00006EXDM|5.0|I give the CD five stars for content (difficult to argue with that rating, this is a classic that the part-time Stones fan can't do without)...  Five stars to Amazon for quick shipping and a pleasant experience with customer service on the phone...  But zero stars to Amazon for misrepresenting what they are selling. <br /> <br />Apparently prior reviewers didn't have this problem, but when I received my \\"Hybrid SACD\\" of Hot Rocks (March '06), I furrowed my brow in concern when I noticed that the SACD logo appeared nowhere on the packaging (it does say \\"DSD Remastered\\" on the spine of the jewel box).  After tearing open the package, I found that the SACD logo appeared nowhere on the disc or in the booklet.  After being inserted in my SACD compatible player, I was unable to access the SACD layer. <br /> <br />That's because this ISN'T the SACD hybrid version that they're advertising it to be.  This is the same standard CD you can buy at your local record store, Best Buy or Wal*Mart.  Speaking of BB, I took this CD to my local outlet and popped the disc(s) into one of their Sony SACD players on the shelf, just to make sure it wasn't just MY unit that wouldn't play it correctly...  The unit in the store did something that my player didn't, which perfectly illustrates the problem, it actually said on the player's LED display \\"NOT HYBRID DISC\\". <br /> <br />Well, I guess THAT clears it up. <br /> <br />Figuring that it was an honest mistake, I called Amazon and pointed out that I'd been shipped the wrong disc.  Kudos to the fellow at Amazon's customer service center, he apologized and promptly sent me a replacement by overnight mail (no charge), and sent a label to affix to the package to return the CD I was erroneously sent.  Only problem is... <br /> <br />The \\"replacement\\" CD is identical to the one I was sent the first time. <br /> <br />Giving up on Amazon after two tries, I have subsequently purchased a lightly-used proper hybrid SACD of Hot Rocks on eBay, and the disc(s) sound great.  FWIW, the hybrid SACD issue of Hot Rocks appears to have only been issued in cardboard fold-out packaging (if online pics are to be believed), so if you order this CD and get it in a jewel box without any mention of it being a hybrid SACD, you've got the \\"regular\\" version of the CD. <br /> <br />The UPC code of the SACD issue is 0-18771-96672-2.  The \\"regular\\" CD has the same number save for the last one, which is -1.  The first and last numbers are very small in comparison to the middle ten, so at first glance the CD's appear to have the same UPC code...  But that little '1' or '2' at the end makes all the difference. <br /> <br />I assume that this is an honest mistake on Amazon's part, but potential buyers who are searching for the SACD version of Hot Rocks have been warned.  I believe that the \\"standard\\" layer on the SACD disc is identical in content and quality to the non-SACD version, so if you don't have an SACD-compatible player, none of this will be of any consequence to you.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|\\"King Kong\\" is not the best overall movie ever made, but it is the best of it's kind in the last 12 years or so.  Not since the origninal \\"Jurassic Park\\" has a creature feature been so exhilarating, enthralling, and just plan fun. <br />The \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films have established Peter Jackson as one of the best genre talents in the business.  I believe that it is his love and respect for the material that elevates him over most other genre filmakers.   Jackson has said in interviews that the original \\"King Kong\\" (1933) was the film that inspired him as a child to become a filmmaker.  That inspiration is evident in this gloriously over-the-top yet emotionally grounded update.   <br />In doing the update, Jackson and his crew execute some very interesting character shifts while keeping fairly close to the original narrative.  It's a neat way of paying tribute to a classic while at the same time giving modern audiences something new other than updated visuals to chew on. <br />The most interesting character redux in \\"King Kong\\" is not, in my opinion, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody).  Oh, to be sure, the new Driscoll is a completely different character on the outside (in the update he's a playwright; in the '33 version he's the crass yet brave first mate), but he's still the main rival to Kong for Ann's attentions. (I won't say \\"affections\\" because this big ape doesn't get down that way, if you take my meaning.) <br />No, instead, the most fascinating character makeover goes to Jack Black's Carl Denham.  In the '33 version, Robert Armstrong played Denham like the \\"Great White Hunter\\" only with a movie camera instead of a gun.  His leadership qualities are never called into question and he's never blamed for the mistakes that eventually lead to Kong's death. <br />In the update, Black plays Denham like Orson Welles without the talent, and I must say his performance resonated with me.  I know some folks thought Black a bad choice for Denham, and he would have been had hebeen forced to emulate Armstrong's interpretation of the character.  But play Denham as an egomaniacal little weasal with a lot of charisma and few if any moral scruples?  For my money, Jack Black hit this one out of the park.  By the end of the film, I wanted to reach through the screen and throttle the arrogant little man, especially when he recites the famous last line.  In the original, there was a sense of truth to the statement, but in the update, it's just another Denham exuse and a way of avoiding responsibility for his actions.  Truly brilliant. <br />Naomi Watts is wonderful as well.  She updates Ann Darrow without seeming too modern.  She does her best to take care of herself but is forced to put herself in the hands of her simian protector.  (Let's face it, Skull Island is not the ideal place to practice female empowerment, or male empowerment for that matter.)  That decision allows for Ann to bond with Kong in a believable way:  their kinship is born of the simple fact that they are the only two creatures on Skull Island who are not trying to kill and eat each other. <br />Is \\"Kong\\" perfect.  Close, but no.  A couple of the effects shots, (particularly the brontosour stampede) have a rushed, unfinished look to them.  They aren't mind numbingly bad, but in comparison to the rest of WETA's work on the film, mediocrity is going to stand out.  I would have also liked to see how in the holy hell they got Kong back to New York.  (I know, I know, you didn't see it in the '33 version, either, but if you're going to update it, than go all the way.) <br />However, these are minor nitpicks.  The clever in-jokes and references to the first film are an unexpected delight, the visuals are eye-popping, the pacing is excellent, the performances pitch perfect, including a tour-de-force from Andy Serkis as Kong.   <br />If you didn't catch it in the theaters because you had seen the earlier film or simply were not interested, I urge you to give Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" a chance.  You will not be disappointed.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is by far the best movie I have seen in years. I rented it upon the advice of a coworker. Watched it twice in a row. Then I immediately ordered the series and the movie on DVD to add to my collection. It draws you in and gets you hooked. <br /> <br />I am now up to 3 converts at work. What a shame that the people at Fox are so focused on immediate payback that they did not allow this show to cultivate an audience (can you spell Seinfeld Fox???). This show and movie are really that good. <br /> <br />It is not necessary to watch the series before the movie, but guaranteed, you will watch the movie again after with a whole different perspective and enjoy it all that much more. <br /> <br />As for the (very few) negatives here, all I can say is.. they just didn't get it.
0131479415|5.0|\\"What is your estimate for analysis, development, and testing of these features?\\" No question filled me with more feeling of exposure and dread in my early days as a developer.  Repeated many times, it would result in the project plans that would be held over our teams' heads for the months.  Uneasiness about the plan started immediately, and only increased as reality unfolded.  This became my main motivation for becoming a project manager- \\"there must be a better way\\", I would think.  This is certainly one.<br /><br />\\"Planning is everything.  Plans are nothing.\\"  These words of Field Marshal Helmuth Graf von Moltke introduce the first chapter, and their importance and relevance to software projects is clear throughout.  This book is a well-organized, smooth-flowing read that simplified for me the mysteries of project and release planning.  As the title declares, the book was written for agile projects, but I believe that the lessons inside can serve various purposes- to provide a pragmatic, repeatable framework for planning in changing project environments, as well as to debunk misconceptions that agile projects are short on planning (in fact the opposite is true).  I've used the techniques recommended herein on several projects- and will do so on every one in the future- they've helped everyone I've worked with understand planning and do a better job at product development in general.<br /><br />George J.

B000E97HIA|3.0|I am a big fan of Prince having got into him when a teenager in the mid-80's.  I have great admiration for the man and own pretty much every album of his.  That said, I like to think I maintain an objective view of his work and would readily concede that quite a number of his post-Warners albums are disappointingly sub-par.  <br /> <br />My personal favourite Prince discs are \\"Around The World In A Day\\", \\"Parade\\", \\"Sign 'O' The times\\", \\"Lovesexy\\", \\"The Gold Experience\\" and \\"Rainbow Children\\".  \\"3121\\" is getting a great reception, which is very encouraging, but how does it really measure up?  Here goes with a track-by-track breakdown: <br /> <br />3121 - I have my suspicions the backing track could date from '94 or thereabouts since it features Michael B and Sonny T from the New Power Generation.  Prince layers various dissonant guitars over the top and unearths his high-pitched Camilla voice for the backing vocals in what is a somewhat perfunctory attempt to be weird.  As an opener, it is a bit of a red herring since the album as a whole plays it safe...  As this pedestrian slice of heavy funk lumbers to it's close, you will not feel that your world has been rocked.  5/10 <br /> <br />Lolita - A great Prince pop track.  The verses remind me strongly of \\"Soft and Wet\\" which is one of my Prince faves. The live drums give it some extra funk power which is cool by me.  The chorus is classic early '80's Prince and the song ends with an amusing call and response.  All in all, this track is a whole lotta fun and brings a big smile to your face. 8/10 <br /> <br />Te Amo Corazon - One of only two tracks on this disc featuring his current band, this is a very mature, gorgeous slow latin-influenced track.  It is obviously from the heart and dedicated to his wife.  The melody is great and the whole thing from song to arrangement to performance is immaculately crafted.  Icing on the cake comes in the form of an orchestra arranged by Claire Fisher (remember \\"Parade\\")? 8/10 <br /><br />Black Sweat - The lead single.  Staccato drum beats abound on what is a very minimalist dance track.  It is the most contemporary sounding thing here and after lots of failed attempts, Prince really does sound cutting edge and in tune with the popular Neptunes etc vogue here.  I particularly like the tasty synth sound on the chorus and the track's overall tightness.  But as a song it really ain't much and to compare it with Kiss as some people have done is merely wishful thinking. 6/10 <br /> <br />Insence and Candles - A mid tempo R&B number and semi-duet with his latest protogee Tamar (more about her later).  Nice fender rhodes keyboard riff and the rhythmic programming is top notch.  The song is very contemporary sounding in a good way and is pretty catchy.  And then Prince decides to spoil things by rapping near the end. Points are also deducted because the track overall is a little anonymous and on the syrupy side. 6/10 <br /> <br />Love - An attempt at a club banger which actually works pretty well.  The melodies and lyrics are both good, the chorus is pretty strong and it is definitely well produced.  I particularly like the classic Prince funky guitar which comes in on the second verse.  Even if it does slighty outstay it's welcome, it is a strong track and, along with Lolita a potential single. 7/10 <br /> <br />Satisfied - A southern soul styled track, ie live drums, smokey atmos and lots of hammond organ and hornz.  Although it is well written (even if a little overdone) and executed, I think he did it much better on Musicology's \\"On The Couch\\" and even better than that on Come's \\"Dark\\".  Put it this way, if this song had not been written and recorded, the world would not have been any the worse for it.  5/10 <br /> <br />Fury - He performed this one at the Brits and on Saturday Night Live - apparantly it went down a storm.  It is an uptempo rock song kinda reminding me of All Along The Watchtower maybe cos of the repeated descending chord sequence.  It is actually very Hendrixsy in the song structure and vocal performance.  Actually, perhaps Santana would be a more appropriate comparison since it definitely has a heavy latin rock tilt now I come to think of it. Definitely a good - perhaps even outstanding - song.  I can imagine it becoming a popular one amongst fans and even maybe something of a standard.  Unfortunately the performance here is rather tame and demo-ish in quality.  He ought to have recorded it with his band in order to do it justice. 7/10 <br /> <br />The Word - Mainly beatbox, acoustic guitar and cheesy synth sax fills.  Quite a catchy melody but praise Jehovah lyrics aside it is all a little bland for my liking.  6/10 <br /> <br />Beatiful Loved and Blessed - This is also the title track of the forthcoming album by his protogee Tamar and she sings most of it.  The best thing I can say about it is that it is well sequenced, coming as it does after The Word, in that it continues and develops on the religious theme in a \\"morning after\\" kinda way.  But as a song it is utterly insipid made worse by the fact that although Tamar can sing prettily enough, her voice is devoid of character.  Perhaps Prince likes her cos he is a bit of a control freak and anybody with a bit of personality might have their own ideas, who knows? 1/10 <br /> <br />The Dance - Abysmal.  A slow moody piano led latin style track with no real song to speak of in which Prince slowly works himself up about absolutely nothing at all.  I just don't like it, I guess.  1/10 <br /> <br />Get On The Boat - His current band are on this JB's style funk number.  It grooves nicely and it is good to hear a solo from Maceo and Sheila E on percussion.  As a tune it is nothing that special and as a JB homage, nowhere near as good as \\"The Work\\" from Rainbow Children or \\"Sexy MF\\".  In fact it even reminds me of a funk tribute band I saw in Amsterdam one time.  But the message is inclusive and positive and as such, it is a fitting way to closeoff the album. 7/10 <br /> <br />Conclusion: All in all, it is a middling effort from the great man.  Although more cohesive, polished and contemporary commercial in its approach than \\"Musicology\\", I actually prefer that album.  It is a shame that the hostile critical and commercial reception afforded \\"Rainbow Children\\" seems to have put him off cutting loose and doing any serious works of art...  <br /> <br />But \\"3121\\" is obviously selling well and I reckon that if you pick this disc up on the strength of \\"Black Sweat\\", his recent TV appearances or your liking for his big commercial successes such as \\"Purple Rain\\", \\"1999\\" or \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\", you won't be disappointed at all.  It is a good mainstream Prince album.  So go ahead and place your order!

B000E33VWW|4.0|Capote is a daring motion picture. <br /> <br />The film is an examination of the creative process, what it means to be a writer. But that isn't what makes it daring. What makes Capote daring is that it doesn't take a deconstructionist approach to the subject matter. In this age of hip, irreverent self-referentialism, the conventional approach would have been to have Truman Capote step in and out of his own story, talking directly to the audience about his state of mind in an effort to give the film a sardonic edge. Capote doesn't do this; it follows a linear narrative structure, depending on mood, facial expressions, subtle dialogue and somber interaction to make its points. As a result, it is a more captivating thesis on writing than, say, Adaptation(not that Adaptation isn't good).  <br /> <br />Capote takes the audience on a dense journey into a writer's mind, particularly the ugly side, the insecurities, the egotism, the exploitation of  close acquaintances, the damaged relationships, the detached facades, the emotional coldness and moral ambivalence. Despite all that, Truman Capote comes across as a likable character. Flawed, without a doubt, but undeniably intriguing. <br /> <br />I haven't even mentioned Philip Seymour Hoffman's indelible performance. I'm convinced that his Capote is the kind of performance that will be talked about for years. Whether or not it is an accurate depiction of the real Truman Capote is practically irrelevant(I've heard that it is, but I'm not familiar enough with the character to make that call). What matters is that Hoffman manages such a complete transformation of his voice and mannerisms while not coming across as an overdone caricature, and that he communicates so much both nonverbally and through the WAY he says things rather than what he actually says. In real life, there is a constant dichotomy between what people say and what they really feel, really mean. Few films explore this, but Hoffman's performance is a textbook example of complex acting, creating a multi-dimensional character. <br /> <br />Capote isn't a perfect film. The music score is hackneyed and many scenes drag on longer than they need to. Minor quibbles when the overall impact is so powerful. This is one of the must-see films of 2005.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|I have listened lots of rock bands and albums but I have not listened Kansas too much before. I heard some of their songs at radio or somewhere else. When I saw this album at Amazon I thought it would be a good chance to meet this band. When I first listened this album I thought I should have listened Kansas before. This album is full of songs that represents American rock typically. Melodies, virtuosity, guitar solos, violin pieces are marvellous. Although the newest song in the album is 23 years old, their music give freshness to listeners. Pieces like Carry on Wayward Son, Hold On, Dust in The Wind are real classics. 12 songs within this album is not enough for a listener. It would be better to be a double album containing more songs. The only remaining solution is to buy Kansas albums individually. So don't be too late to listen this band (like me).
B000E97HIA|4.0|\\"3121\\" is a great album for 2006 on its own merits, straight up.  Intensely funky, fun, rich and diverse, it's everything Prince excells at.  Too many reviews harken to the past, referencing Prince's former albums and styles, missing the fact that he is and always has been a contemporary and forward-looking artist, and a reactionary.  In the case of \\"3121\\" he re-injects melody, taste, positivity and overall musicality into today's middling genres of RnB, pop, dance and rock.  It needed it.  Mostly, I think Prince was aiming for an electrifying, sexy, funny, uplifting party album and hit right on the mark. <br /> <br />To criticize his work is to take for granted that Prince remains one of the greatest living male vocalists, guitarists, arrangers, producers, songwriters and band leaders (among many other things).  Hopefully \\"3121\\" will inspire some more upcoming hitmakers.  We could use more musicians of his caliber.  Long live Prince.

Brokeback Mountain clearly shows the tragic price exacted not only from the lovers but from all the characters involved.

0451529308|4.0|As the father of a teenage daughter who was about to see the screen play based on this book, I am probably an atypical reader of \\"Little Women\\", but I enjoyed it none the less.  \\"Little Women\\" tells the charming story of the March family as the girls grow over several years.  Presenting an idealized view of life beginning in Civil War era New England, it gives a glimpse into the world of their class and time.  Occasionally it is refreshing to read a book which is just plain enjoyable, without devious characters and subliminal agendas.  This book is a delight, even for those who are not, and never were, Little Women.
B0002IQHZM|4.0|Since \\"Sutras\\" his astounding comeback album rated five stars, I have to rate this one only four stars as it's not QUITE as good (and half stars aren't allowed). But make no mistake, it's still very, very cool.<br /><br />It's so amazing that Donovan is back and sounds as good as he does, 40 years after I first discovered him.  And he's not some nostalgia act; he's doing important new groundbreaking work!  He sounds great too.<br /><br />\\"Beat Cafe\\" finds him swaggering with an acoustic trio in deliberately \\"hip\\" arrangements which, in lesser hands, could have been cloying.  But this is never overplayed, never broad, never tongue-in-cheek -- just a very relaxed set of neo-beatnik grooves which he, alone among his contemporaries, has the cachet to perform with authenticity.<br /><br />Did I mention cool?
B000A59PMO|5.0|This quote from Joss Whedon is pretty well known I guess, so it is a bit of a cliche, however it is the perfect thing to describe this show. I love tv shows and my all time favorite used to be 24. I never thought anything could ever be better than that. Right untill I saw Veronica Mars. Of course it is a completely different genre and all, but it is simply better. At first glance it seems this show is no different then, say, the OC or all the other teen-shows. But only the setting is the same. A highschool and a small tomn where the middle-class doesn`t exist. But everything else in Veronica Mars is very very different. The heroine is a high school girl with uncanny abilities as a PI and an attitude like nothing you`ve ever seen. She really is a lot like the Bogart tipe of noir PI and not a Nancy Drew kind of ideological innocent girl. The show itself is full of sarcasm, irony, darkness and most of all, pain. That is the main reason it is as good as it is. It is most fascinating how it can remain actually optimistic and even jolly despite the amount of pain in it. It is a lot like Buffy the vampire slayer in this aspect. The main plot which extends through the whole season is a murder investigation of \\"who killed Lilly Kane?\\", kind of like the \\"who killed Laura Palmer?\\" in Twin Peaks. There is a smaller mistery in every episode. This is the other main reason this show is excellent; the smaller misteries are actually small, like e-mail fraud or stolen money at a poker game (not like every other investigation tv show, where there`s nothing but murder or rape), and yet, these misteries are just as interestingly done here as the serious ones in other shows. The DVD itself is quite good, picture quality is solid. There isn`t a big variety of bonus material, only deleted scenes, but there are a whole bunch of those. Honestly, I wanted to write a review of the show itself and not the DVD.
B0009YA386|4.0|I first hered The Editors while on itunes music store, and there song Munich was the free download of the week... So I picked it up. The song hit me quick... I simply love whoever produces for this band, cause whoever does is a genious. The production methods are at that top teir where nearly anyone can enjoy it... Me myself I am more of a Hip Hop, and Rap fan, and I cop very few UK Bands stuff, but this is good... And I just thought I would reveiw it to say, that fans of almost an genre will enjoy this music, and that is when you know your good... I really dont like the vocal style. but that is mostly because im used to a more rapping style of delivery in a deeper more U.S. Street voice, but other than that I like it. I checked out there old albums and this one is much better... <br />Sure to me at least they are no MF Doom, GZA, or 2Pac lyrically, and as far as there producing, I think Premo, Dre, and Alchemist can beat them, but I am more of a Hip Hop guy... In short this is a great album, and the production on there single is simply amazing, and being a music lover, and a upcoming producer myself, I don't really know how anyone can hate this album, it is just solid.
1579125549|5.0|To become a virtuoso in anything, the key is practice.  Scarlatti wrote piano studies that were challenging, taught the basics of music theory through the composition, and sounded beautiful at the same time.  Not all of the puzzles in this book are beautiful, but then neither are the positions I sometimes seem to find myself in when playing a 1300+ player.  The thing I noticed about these puzzles is that they are very carefully organized, showing you every way a particular piece can mate with just a pawn companion, for example.  In other words, variations.  I have found myself beginning to understand the power and limitations of the pieces and pawns in a much deeper way.  My latest tournament games were 30 minute games lost only because my opponents were able to avoid the inevitable mate by playing for time instead of any real equality.  I need to speed up my calculation a bit, but my tactics are sound.  This book will remain within reach as long as I am playing competitve chess.
B00000F14B|5.0|I already loved this movie before I bought it. My parents owned a video tape version which I grew up watching and loving.  <br />I was curious about the new Music Man that just came out recently, and though it was good in itself, it lacked the energy of this original. <br />I loved it growing up, and I love it now. I'm just glad it's my very own now. =D
B000002OX5|5.0|\\"The Who Sell Out\\" is one among ( at least 3 ) several Who master pieces. With its build up as a commercial radio station program with commercials in between the songs and overall great songwriting, the album may very well be the most varied and most entertaining Who album.<br /><br />1967 was a year of psychedelia in rock music and the Who were among the pioneers of that trend. This is obvious from the first track of the album \\"Armenia in the Sky\\". The outstanding single \\"I Can See For Miles\\" is among the very best psychelia songs recorded.<br /><br />The acoustic \\"Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand\\" is another Who favourite - beautiful melody, great rhythm and intelligent lyrics.  Actually the lyrics are overall great on this album  - with wit and homour.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Odorono\\" and \\"Tattoo\\" are rarely included on Who compilations - and they're both bound to be great positive surprises to the first-time listener of the album.<br /><br />\\"Our Love Was\\" and \\"I Can't Reach\\" are other fine tracks - both more in the style of their previous album \\"A Quick One\\".<br /><br />I might be expected that the short commercials ( most of them musically done ) would be annoying after the first couple listens - but this is really not the case. These short tracks works great in the context of the album.<br /><br />Only the final two tracks of the original album seem a little out of place. Townshend's acoustic \\"Sunrise\\" is quite beautiful, but \\"Rael\\" feels somewhat longwinded and dated.<br /><br />Most of the bonus-tracks are great - most of the apparently were only left out due to lack of space on the vinyl format.<br /><br />Try to shuffle the tracks - the bonus-tracks really fit in nicely with the originals.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Let me open by saying that I've been a fan of the Final Fantasy series for the majority of my life. I grew up with a parent that thought video games should teach something. She heard about a text heavy game called \\"Final Fantasy\\" for the NES and she brought it home. From that moment forward I was hooked. Final Fantasy has always been about places to go and friends to meet. I still remember the first moment Final Fantasy VII's graphics graced my eyes, and I remember the tears I cried when Aerith died, and the laughter shared when the hero's finally came through. These are my friends here. Since those endless days and nights of gaming in 1997, Final Fantasy has evolved graphically but always seemed to have maintained the feel created by FFVII. Since so many more concepts were introduced, and an adopted love for the new characters came about (mainly Rinoa...Yuna...), I had all but forgotten about an FFVII sequal. Then it happened... I began to see articles upon articles and screenshots, movie clips... then merchandice... Oh my. There were my friends again, from the very first game I played that made me cry... think... explore the human condition... that made me attached. My friends, in the glorious graphics topping even the CGI used in FFX. I became excited! I heard of this story... clouds back??! Future times? Turks??! Mother?! Yes! This was an addition to the story that I spent nights and nights slowly unraveling! Then the fateful day came. I heard that Advent Children was to be released in Japan... I waited for the date and prayed for a sign. Two days later I was gifted with the hiro fansub japanese divx release of the movie. And as I watched I looked for her... Where is she? Where is she? And then... Aerith... I still can't qualm my tears or stop my heart from beating so heavily. It was everything I could have hoped it to be... Everything I dreamed of... Please if you feel as emotional about this release as I do, pre-order a copy of it for yourself... :) thx
B0008ENIAC|5.0|In Joan's 6-decade career she had 5 career defining pictures. These are: [[ASIN:6302048982 Our Dancing Daughters]], [[ASIN:B0010DRYPA Grand Hotel]], [[ASIN:B0008ENICU The Women ]], [[ASIN:B000EU1Q4A What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? ]]and her most famous movie role ever, \\"Mildred Pierce.\\" All of these movies were extremely influential for both the film industry and for fans of Joan, especially. But \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is truly extra special because it opened the floodgates for an entirely new genre and showcased a brand-new Joan Crawford.    Joan is no longer the loveless shop girl when she goes to work for Warners portraying workhorse Mildred Pierce in her comeback picture, after leaving MGM. In this film, Joan plays the title-role (later known as either Mildred Beragon or Mildred Pierce Beragon.)     Mildred Pierce (September 24, 1945) (Studio: Warners)  Runtime Listing: 109 mins  Color/BW: Black and White  (Joan played: Mildred Pierce Beragon)  Brief Synopsis:  A woman turns herself into a business tycoon to win her selfish daughter a place in society.    Special Features on this double-sided disc:   Joan Crawford Warner Bros. Documentary  Cast & Crew Info   \\"Mildred Pierce\\" Original Trailer   \\"Humoresque\\" Original Trailer   \\"Flamingo Road\\" Original Trailer   \\"The Damned Don't Cry\\" Original Trailer   \\"Goodbye My Fancy\\" Original Trailer   \\"This Woman Is Dangerous\\" Original Trailer   Note: \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is also included on Joan's [[ASIN:B0008ENID4 Warner Home Video Boxed Set ]].     The movie starts out with Mildred trying to jump off a bridge in an apparent suicide attempt. A cop who's patrolling the area talks her down and she is later taken downtown for questioning when it is revealed that her second husband has been shot and killed!     Most of the movie is a flashback, as Mildred tells her story to the investigator. Joan sounds so empathetic and has such a morose look on her face as she's sitting there being questioned. Everyone can see what she is going through and everyone can tell how despondent she is simply by looking at her.     Here are the main cast members of the movie:  Joan Crawford / Mildred Pierce Beragon  Ann Blyth / Veda Pierce Forrester  Butterfly McQueen / Lottie  Jack Carson / Wally Fay  Zachary Scott / Monte Beragon  Eve Arden / Ida Corwin  Jo Ann Marlowe / Kay Pierce  Bruce Bennett / Albert Pierce    Over the course of only a few years Mildred managed to turn herself into a business tycoon and tried to do just about anything to win the love and attention of her children. Mildred even left her husband when he couldn't sit by any longer and watch as she continued spoiling them. Mildred's response was: it may not be right, but that's just the way it is.    Joan was so breathtakingly beautiful in this movie. (Although Joan has since said that she looked \\"crummy\\" in this movie.) Her makeup and dresses and hats and accessories were all pure 1940's style. But Joan added her own touch of elegance and beauty which helped shape an entirely new fashion trend for bored American Women who were otherwise busy suffering through their second World War. My favorite outfit is that oversized fur (mink?) coat with matching hat that she can be seen wearing during the beginning. So over-the-top and dramatic. Pure Joan Crawford!    Veda. She was a handful. And so beautiful and talented. Ann Blyth has such a lovely voice and appeared in a variety of musicals after this film. Veda and Mildred looked so much alike. They almost looked like they could be sisters because Joan looked so young. This was probably done to convey that Mildred got married at such a young age and was virtually trapped.     Throughout the entire picture Joan's acting is hands down her very best performance, ever. It's like she was taking an important exam and studied for it day and night and when it came time she aced it. Joan has given many stellar performances throughout her long career, but none of them are as captivating or as memorable as \\"Mildred Pierce.\\"     It's hard to say which is my very favorite scene because there are so many that I really enjoy. I especially loved the scene in the beginning with Veda berating her mother. Did you notice how dramatic it was when Joan gave her that much-deserved smack? I felt like I could hear a pin drop because everyone got quiet. I also loved the scene on the steps with Veda taunting Mildred after she weaseled the 10 grand from the rich family. \\"At this stage it's a matter of opinion,\\" she says when Mildred questions if she is really with child. \\"Veda I'm beginning to see you for the very first time,\\" Joan says with such passion and despair. Veda continues taunting her mother, finally Mildred snatches the check out of her hand and tears it to shreds! And all of a sudden Veda clocks her mom in the face and Mildred falls down in such a theatrical, yet speedy manner (just like how Dorothy's house landed in Oz.) \\"Veda you get your things and you get out,\\" Mildred orders. Even though Mildred was always nice as pie to Veda I bet in this situation she would have loved to beat the hell out of this little monster; Veda took off up the stairs as fast as she could!    The scene with Kay dying was especially tragic. Some have said that Joan didn't act enough in this particular segment of the movie. I tend to disagree. I believe it was the just the right balance of composure and mournfulness. Because the plot was trying to convey that Mildred still had Veda, who was really her favorite. (God knows why?)     There are some really great supporting roles in this movie. Ann Blyth was perfect and deservedly received an Oscar nomination for her role as the spoiled (rhymes with) witch because her entire being was so devious and sinister; from star to finish. I also enjoyed Miss Butterfly McQueen, typecast as Lottie; Mildred's do-anything maid. Zachary Scott was really convincing as the sneaky snake Monte Beragon. He played a really good con-man. And, finally I was very impressed with Eve Arden. She was such a funny actress and gave some great one-liners: leave some clothes on me, or I'll get cold (she said sarcastically to Wally as he was staring at her legs.)     This was Joan's first dramatic role after switching to Warners (her first film for them was the musical [[ASIN:6302120578 Hollywood Canteen]]) and during this time Joan was just churning out some of her very best movies. Joan also made a variety of other top-notch movies that were not unlike \\"Mildred Pierce,\\" these of course include \\"Flamingo Road,\\" \\"The Damned Don't Cry\\" and \\"This Woman is Dangerous.\\"     Contrary to popular belief Joan did not have to take a screen test for \\"Mildred Pierce.\\" That is an absolute fallacy. In 1943 when Joan signed on with Warners she was given complete control over all of her movies; which included script approval, cast approval and director approval. At the time, this was completely unheard of; even stars such as Greta Garbo or Bette Davis were never afforded the same courtesy. In 1945 (when this picture was filmed,) Joan was one of the most powerful women in all of Hollywood. Joan did agree to be filmed reading some of the lines, but this was hardly a test and she did this only because she was always a team player and she knew that her director was threatened by such a powerful woman. But this did not decide Joan's fate in this movie, at all. The only person Joan answered to as far as her career with Warners was the executive producer and owner of the studio, Jack Warner.     Joan won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of \\"Mildred Pierce.\\" \\"I felt like it was for all of my roles up to then just as much as for Mildred,\\" Joan once proudly said. Unfortunately, on the awards night Joan was deathly ill. Her doctor warned her not to leave her home under any circumstance. Joan didn't want to get even sicker nor would she have ever gone out in public if she ever thought that it may disappoint her public. So she stayed in bed and awaited the news.Movie Trivia  * [[ASIN:630278705X Laughing Sinners]] is Joan's only other movie that starts out with her character attempting to jump off a bridge.  * Joan won her only Oscar for this movie (she was nominated 2 other times since this picture.)  * Miss Butterfly McQueen is uncredited in both \\"Mildred Pierce,\\" and in Joan's '39 classic \\"The Women.\\"   * The movie is based on the book by James M. Cain, by the same title.  * The alternative band, Sonic Youth has a song titled \\"Mildred Pierce.\\"   * Zachary Scott has often been confused with Joan's costar from [[ASIN:6302413516 When Ladies Meet ]], Robert Taylor.  *  The director, Michael Curtiz also directed both Joan and Zachary Scott in Joan's '49 classic [[ASIN:B000XNZ7NO Flamingo Road ]].  * Bruce Bennett is the oldest living cast member (at the age of 99.)   * There was an actress in this film whose real name was Veda. Veda Ann Borg played the role of Miriam Ellis.    Joan was always such a thankful person who never forgot her coworkers that helped her along. When she was asked about \\"Mildred Pierce\\" (more than 3 decades later) all she wanted to do was thank her colleagues: First of all credit, big credit where credit is due. To Jim Cain, who wrote the novel and created a character so real couldn't help play. \\"Play\\" in quotes. To Jack Carson, Ann Blyth, Zachary Scott, George Tobias, and Eve Arden, who breathed life into the subsidiary characters and made Mildred come off.     Who would enjoy \\"Mildred Pierce?\\" If you enjoy classic pictures during Hollywood's Golden Age you will love this movie. If you enjoy anything with Joan Crawford you will love this movie. If you enjoy suspense or mystery then you will certainly like this one. Remember, you are what you watch!
B000002GY9|5.0|Some of Tom's greatest hits are here, Tom Traubert's Blues (Four Sheets To The Wind In Copenhagen), Step Right Up, I Wish I Was In New Orleans (In The Ninth Ward), The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me), Invitation To The Blues, Pasties And A G-String (At The Two O'Clock Club), The One That Got Away, Small Change (Got Rained On With His Own .38) and I Can't Wait To Get Off Work (And See My Baby On Montgomery Avenue).<br /><br />  Ok, did I pick most of the album?  Well, that's because this really is, along with Heart of Saturday Night and Nighthawks at the Diner, one of his three classic 70's albums.<br /><br />  Tom Traubert's Blues got me misty eyed for decades.<br /><br />  Step Right Up is one of the funniest huckster word spinning takes on capitalism in existance.<br /><br />  The Piano Has Been Drinking is sublime.  On first listening you get sucker punched at the end of the song.  Every time I have heard it after that I'm enjoying his clever imagery and looking forward to that sweet, perfectly formed ending.<br /><br />  Pasties and a G-String is bawdy and puts you right there.<br /><br />  This is an album to cherish.  He's fully into his character, it's the smokey piano lounge scene and it's in full bloom on this record.  He takes us to his place deep in the heart of the city and we're never the same afterward.<br /><br />  Taken together with those other two 70's albums of his, the trilogy is one of the finest works of musical art presented to the public over the period of a decade ever.  You could throw in One From the Heart if you wanted as the bookend of his 70's work despite it being done in 1981.<br /><br />  That's all we got of 70's Tom.  His 80's reincarnation is not the same musical character.  It's not so much a loss, as it is the same loss we all experience when we no longer are in our teens or 20's.  There's a new version of us even though we're the same person.  The good news is, Tom keeps giving us these gifts of music and word play that have stood the test of decades and, one can easily say, still touch hearts as long as people are around to hear it.  chrisbct@hotmail.comtood the test of decades and, one can easily say, still touch hearts as long as people are around to hear it.  chrisbct@hotmail.com

B000002GYR|4.0|It surprises me every time I hear Ol' 55 as I can't help but think of the EAGLES' version as they cover his song.  In the comparison in my mind Tom always wins.<br /><br />  This album is unlike any of his others.  Some debut albums are fully formed, often times, the finest material a band every releases.  They are unable to ever duplicate the feat of their initial inspiration.  A debut album, often, I believe, is a compliation of a band's first material that they may have been playing for years already.  Albums after that, that's when we know if they've got moxie, if there's a deeper resevoir of music and song writing talent in the artist.<br /><br />  NEIL YOUNG reminds me of this pattern.  His first album also seems to be a bit green, not the fully formed Neil we come to see unfold before our eyes and ears in the decades to follow.  One could say the exact same thing about this album.  It's not produced like any of his other albums.  It's a bit stilted.  Either Tom hadn't found his natural voice and/or musical pacing or the producer wasn't able to get onto vinyl Tom's true musical creations.<br /><br />  We know that right after this on Heart of Saturday Night and then Small Change Tom hits the ground running and totally finds his real musical/emotional/album self and presence to create two of the finest albums I've ever heard and that's a judgement of over 30 years on.<br /><br />  Should the Waits novice get this album?  I'd say go for the other two first.  Get this later.  It's not his best work yet for the Waits fan it's indispensible.  One can enjoy his delightful songs and get to hear him in his least gravely voice, not, like on Seinfield, that there's anything wrong with his gravely voice.  I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You,<br /><br />Rosie, Lonely, Ice Cream Man, Little Trip To Heaven (On The Wings Of Your Love) and Closing Time all well worth hearing and enjoying over the years and, really, there's not a clunker on the album.<br /><br />  Hear one of America's finest musical artists at the beginning of his career.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Highly Disappointing!!!  Do yourself a favor and save that $20 bill for a lofty purpose.  Don't buy this movie.  You may like this new version \\"ONLY\\" if you have not watched the A&E's (T.V mini series) of Pride and Prejudice by Simon Langton. <br /> <br />I've an ardent admirer of Jane Austen's novels and have watched the mini series and it has been a priceless possession of my video library for years. I fell in love with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, the first time I watched the movie. Watching it, you transcend into the realms of English Aristocracy and get mesmerized by the characters in the movie.... Mrs. Bennet a lovable woman, Mr. Colins, Caroline Bingley and Mr. Wickham. You name it - \\"ALL\\" the characters are adorable and the beauty of it is, one tends to identify with the characters.   <br /> <br /> <br />BUT this NEW Pride and Prejudice, starring Knightly is a \\"SOUR GRAPE\\"! Immature, Poorly portrayed, Emotional blunder. Does not do justice to the 18th Century England. Characters in the movie are annoying, including - Mr. Darcy, who is expressionless and knows not, how to hold himself! Colin Firth on the other hand was elegant and charming. Elizabeth Bennet (Knightley) has this unwanted, weird smile on her face, at times, that bothers me. Mr. & Mrs. Gardiner are worthless. Mr. Bingley is funny with a horrible hair-do and weak gestures. Basically EVERY single character looks fake. The costumes are no where close to tolerable. There is no bond between sisters in this movie like you could see in the previous Jennifer Ehle version of it.  I could go ON& ON ...  <br /> <br />Sorry, but I have Nothing good to say, about this remake of Pride and Prejudice!  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001FFJ|5.0|That's not counting the One From the Heart soundtrack he did at the request of Francis Ford Coppala.  That album remained true to his 70's sound when it appears Tom was already shifting to his quite different 80's sound.<br /><br />  The 70's Tom brought us smoky piano lounge music and done to perfection on Heart of Saturday Night and Small Change.  One From the Heart is no slouch either, assuming you don't mind hearing Crystal Gayle throughout the album which isn't that difficult. One thing's for sure, Tom has his own sound.  He almost pulled the heart out of the essence of a musical sound, the piano playing, smoking blusey, smart aleck, love torn, even love hopeful character out of an era before the rock era.  He embodied the character and seemed to have a lot of fun with it, taking us to that place in the seedy heart of L.A. and gifting us with his imagery and Louie Armstrong invoking voice, yet a voice distinctly his own.<br /><br />  The 80's?  What's this shift he made musically from the 70's to the 80's?  It got wilder, less smoky, less just him at the piano focused and more of maybe a clanging New Orleans inspired noise merchant who could still construct a lovely melody and evoke vivid images, only now the musical palate was expanded, more unexplored territory.  Yet, he seemed to know where he was going.  Some of these songs, Singapore, Clap Hands, Time and Rain Dogs jump off the page, gems formed by Tom and given to us for the ages.  The album works as a whole.  It's a journey he takes, an artist painting with words, images he sees and feels and shares with us.  Tom is able to convey his emotions in his songs as well as take us to a place we've never been, or, if we have some vague familiarity with the terrain, we sure haven't been down to this part of his personal town.  Heck, the more I think about it, this album is sorta like a movie or a book in a way that most musicians are not able to accomplish.  He's both a wordsmith and someone who creates whole, a universe that we may have had a hint existed but he brings us right in, shows us around and, like the best artists, entertains us and reminds us of our own emotional journeys.<br /><br />  Feel free to purchase this album if you have not yet already.  At 19 songs, the guy isn't skimpin' and there's not a dud in the box.  chrisbct@hotmail.coma universe that we may have had a hint existed but he brings us right in, shows us around and, like the best artists, entertains us and reminds us of our own emotional journeys.   <br />     Feel free to purchase this album if you have not yet already.

1591396190|2.0|It has some interesting observations, but is light on content.  It lacks specific advice and has few tactics you can actually use.  Though it's good for people who just want to know things but don't want to do anything about it.
1582403589|4.0|After reading the first issue free on imagecomics.com, I decided to pick up the first volume of the Walking Dead series. Essentially, it's the George Romero zombie mythology, treated seriously (unlike Dawn of the Dead), and in comic form. I've always liked the idea of what the Romero zombie mythos could be - the survival aspects, the \\"end of the world\\", semi-apocalypse feel it could have boasted - and the word of mouth on this book is very good, so I snatched it up. <br /> <br />The plot is what you'd expect: A guy wakes up in a hospital bed to find that zombies have devastated all he knew. He tries to find his family and meets up with a group of survivors. What follows is a lot of human drama intercut with incidents of zombie attacks. Think 28 Days Later meets Night Of The Living Dead and you have the right idea. <br /> <br />The Walking Dead is good, maybe even very good, but not as great as the word of mouth would lead you to believe. Kirkman's dialogue is sometimes too obviously *dialogue*, and the pace is off in a way I can't place my finger on. It sometimes seems to move in fits and starts, and the cadence of some scenes feels off. Vague criticism, I know, but it was hard to shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right. The flaws are niggling and minor, though, not so great that they detract from the whole - which is good in that this remains a highly enjoyable book, and bad in that they are all the more frustrating for it. <br /> <br />Make no mistake, I liked it just fine and will most certainly read the next volume - the scenario is played very seriously, the characters well-developed, the situation highly compelling, and the art is gorgeous to behold - but I won't be rushing out to get it right away like I would if the series had really blown me away. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for zombie/Romero fans, modestly recommended for those who like forays into comics that don't have folks with capes flying around beating up other folks with capes.

068485743X|4.0|Writers who aren't naive know there is no Magic Bullet to getting published, and more importantly, there exists no magic formula one can take to turn into a good writer. It takes a lot of work. A LOT of work. You're going to write tons and tons of garbage before you even begin to SNIFF good writing. And then the REAL work begins. And that work never stops, because if you don't keep at it, you can lose it. That's why, no matter your level of skill, it's a good idea to remind yourself of easy mistakes to make when plying your craft. <br /> <br />The First Five Pages is a fine little book of tips for the beginning writer, keying in on common mistakes and offering workable solutions and examples that will seem impossibly stupid to the experienced writer but which will illuminate problems to the beginning writer. <br /> <br />But the word \\"little\\" should be noted, because this book offers very little in the way of depth, breezing way too fast through its subject matter, at best touching on a subject for a light page or three before moving on. Most decent websites on writing will offer you the same information. They'll do it for free. And they'll often be more thorough, offering more extensive and useful examples. <br /> <br />That said, the advice here is good, and much of it is downright essential. It's unlikely to offer anything new to the experienced writer, but it will serve as a good supplement to the lessons being learned by new and intermediate writers. At worst, it's a fine refresher - which, let's face it, all writers need from time to time. The examples offered are laughable and can be readily skipped by all but the newest of newcomers, but the rest of the material, while repeating what you should already know, is on target and well presented.
B0000024JA|5.0|\\"Tical\\" is a f***in' great Wu-solo album from the M-E-T-H-O-D MAN!  Nice dark beats, phat rhymes from this wu-soulja, straight up classic!  Even if youre not a big Wu-Tang fan, check this album out.

0553801503|2.0|After endless hours of reading through five or so characters I actually want to read about, or even CARE about, I finally get back to one I do.  Needless to say, this required diligence and a patience I normally don't possess, and a bottle of excedrin. <br /> <br />Mr. Martin could've made this story phenominal if he'd just stuck to the characters the first book started with, the Starks.  This latest installment bored me to tears, to be honest, and I really reaaaaally don't care to read about Circe.  Her chapters were predictable to the point where I'd find myself laughing about how she's just 'another bad guy.'  In fact the vast majority of the book could have just been over-written with chapters all about the Starks, with maybe a few about other big players in the story.   <br /> <br />I'm begging of you, Martin, please for the love of Pete, stick to the interesting stuff, or I'm going to need a stronger pain reliever to sit through the next one!
B000002LIM|4.0|I thought the Batman score was brilliant, although some of the music that they had from the 1989 movie wasn't on the CD.  For example, the bit at the beginning when the boy and his parents got mugged in the alley way.  Jack meets up with Eckhart.  The Axis Chemical plan with boss Carl Grissham.  And a few others that I thought should be good enough to be on the CD.   <br />My favorite would have to be all of it, but track no. 17 would have to be my pick where the Joker and Vicky Vale going up Gotham City Cathedral and definately The Waltz (track no.18).  I loved the Smiley tune that was not on the CD but in the movie where the Joker interrupts the news footage advertising his new Joker brand.  That's tune's really fun to listen to.  If you loved the movie, then this would be an ideal CD for you.  Don't be dissapointed though that some music from the movie is not on the CD because it is still good to listen to. <br />    <br />
B00005JO9J|4.0|With all of today's medical shows around, it's hard to find one that stand out. Gray's Anantomy does just this. The characters are easy to relate to and could represent many people in our lives. It's always nice to watch a show that can easily pull you in.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|There are no words to truly describe how amazing Michael is. Having seen him perform live, I love watching the DVD over and over reliving the memories.
B000063COX|5.0|There were tons of metal bands coming out of England in the ealry 80s. A lot of people these days may only know a few of these bands nowadays, but Iron Maiden is one of the bands most people DO remember. And for good reason! These guys make some of the best damn metal music known to man. A lot of their later material was made in a more progressive metal fashion, but this first album is raw and untamed. Very punk like and mean. Hardly any progressive shades, this is just an all out metal attack. <br /> <br />Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton make a good team, the guitar solos here are amazing. Paul di'Anno may be known as \\"the guy who came before Bruce Dickenson\\" but he holds his own pretty well. I think his singing is pretty good. Prowler is a killer opener. I love that opening riff, very punkish and awesome. A nice catchy song with a very melodic solo. I told you the solos on here were good! Sanctuary is probably the most punkish song on here and Charlotte the Harlot is a very rockin' tune. I love the part where it slows down, and then we get some nice drum work and the song speeds back up again. Running Free is a very anthemic song that I love to sing to and I am sure others do too. Even the guitar riffs on here are catchy, how do they do this stuff? Iron Maiden is a nice little tune with a catchy opening riff, and a nice speedy pace (speedy for its time anyway). I love the way Paul sings it, he has such authority to his voice.  <br /> <br />Transylvania is an awesome instrumental with some of the best f*cking guitar playing you will ever hear! Just check out those solos! Amazing. Remember Tomorrow has soft and heavy parts, and a rip-roaring solo. Paul sings very well on the slow parts, very calm and relaxed. I love when the song gets heavier from out of nowhere. Strange World is a ballad, and an awesome one at that! The guitar solo on there is simply beautiful, whoever thought a guitar could convey such emotion? Phantom of the Opera is a 7 minute centerpiece. It hints at the band's future progressive works. Those opening riffs are nothing short of powerful. Paul sings very fast on this one. I love that instrumental section in the middle of the song, I mean those riffs and solos are mesmerizing. Simply wonderful! <br /> <br />I had a LOT to say about the guitar playing, but trust me, just check this album out and you will know why. For a first album, this really is a job well done. Guitar players need to check this album out, they will love the riffs on here. But of course, you should have already had this for some time now....
B00005JO9J|5.0|It's great... so much drama but in an un-annoying way.  Would definately recommend it to ANYONE!
B000EJ9VUW|4.0|for new rock music.   their name make them seem like one of many in that stale end of the gene pool, the insipid, derivitive breed of indie-rock the likes of which should be avoided (left for 16 year olds encountering rock'n'roll for the first time).  But the Liars actually have lots to offer.  a very good listen all the way round.
B000BT97AO|5.0|A lot of reviews have stated this film has no real substance in the story but I must disagree.  Those reviews keep trying to define Mirrormask in terms of their own childhood fantasies, but in Mirrormask you find a fairytale full of all the terrors that are unique to today's world.  No longer are we concerned with children losing themselves in a vast, uncharted world.  Now, the children are frightened of their \\"parents\\", the parents who don't love them, the parents who only want to use them.  How are the children to find their way to the parent who truly cares for them; how can they tell the difference?  In most of the movies that are compared to Mirrormask, the children are lost and in search of home where everything will suddenly be all better.  Mirrormask, however, explores a new dilemma - children faced with multiple homes, none of which is the perfect place where everyone is happy all the time.  And given the option of homes, how is the child to know the right one?  To me, Mirrormask has achieved something only rarely seen today; it has created and brand new fairytale.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|OK this is one of my favorite aneme movies because of the idea with an insect whisperer. It was such a good idea. What is so interesting about this movie is that you can actually calm insects my doing hypnotizing movements. For example, you can actually catch a dragon fly with your fingers by doing a circular motion toward the insect. And you guys thought it was all make believe! The soundtrack was great. The scene where she is flying through the clouds with the music rushing her through is awesome. The characters were fun, clever, and humorous.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Awesome DVD.  Perfect for anyone who is obsessed with Grey's like me or for anyone just now getting hooked on the show.  Lots of cool special features.  Great deal.
B0006J28BO|4.0|This movie took me totally off guard. I sat down to watch this movie with a bunch of little kids thinking it would be the same old talking animal movie. But I found myself almost rolling on the floor laughing along with the kids. The humor was witty and spontaneous, and the characters had excellent chemistry with each other.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|I'm not sure if the review will put my fathers name or my name as the reviewer, but I'm the son of Mark DiMartino. <br /> <br />I have to say that I really enjoyed this dvd.  I saw parts of it when it was aired on PBS.  This actually got me into Bob Dylan.  I started researching his music and I love it. <br /> <br />This dvd was made very well.  There is a whole lot of information that you can learn about Bob Dylan.  I like how there are scenese of him performing various songs throughout too.  The bonus full length Bob Dylan performances are great to have. <br /> <br />I just have to say that this is for anyone.  If you're a hard core fan, just getting into him, or now nothing then you'll enjoy this product.  I'm really glad I purchased this and I know you will be too.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|this is possibly one of the worst horror films ever made. It lacks even a half decent script and a poorly explored plot.  <br />It also has no ending, it merely comes to an abrupt halt, which in retrospect is much more welcoming than having to sit thorugh another hour.  <br />The story is - 3 backpackers head to slovakia on the promise of hot girls, which there are and so the first half becomes a soft core porn flick. these girls then drug the backpackers and deliver them to a place where you can pay to torture people. one escapes, comes across one of the torturers and then kills him. This pointless waste of money only gains one star for at least being an interesting idea. unfortunately it suffers from an appaling script and stunning lack of direction.  <br />At least director Eli Roth is showing consistency in his calibre of film.
B000002UAU|5.0|In almost every poll of greatest album this one tops the list(if not it's usually Revolver)and it doesn't take Einstein to figure out why once you listen to it. Hands down the best album of all time and unlikely ever to be equalled. Every song is brilliant from the psychedelic Lucy and Kite to gorgeous songs like the generation gap anthem She's Leaving Home and the wonderful When I'm 64. As english as a tea party and the most sublime musical experience you'll ever have.
0975991477|5.0|This book really points out that we are not alone. That there really is a God or intelligent force that helps us everyday in every way, based upon our freewill desires. I think it should be required reading for every high school student.
B000E5N62U|3.0|The Eighties were hell for Steely Dan fans as \\"Gaucho\\" and \\"Nightfly\\" were out before the decade really got off the ground.  The Nineties saw Donald Fagen and Walter Becker return to the world with a pair of solo albums and a live Steely Dan.  By comparison, this decade has been a literal gusher of productivity with two SD albums and now Fagen's latest.  Unfortunately, as much as I am grateful to again hear new material, I only wish it came across as something more inspired.  Don't get me wrong, the recording itself is sonic perfection and the instrumentals on \\"The Great Pagoda of Funn\\" are impeccable.  And the charming \\"Security Joan\\" will always bring a smile.  However, I cannot help but wonder if this album represents the best that Donald Fagen can do and if not, then I hope it's not another decade before we hear that album.
0316776963|4.0|Sedaris is absolutely hilarious with this comedic view of his family life. Although a few essays strayed from the general flow, this collection reads as a novel.  For a good laugh and a quick weekend read, I strongly recommend it.

B00003CXB4|5.0|Someone in another review wrote that this movie has an agenda similar to Adolf Hitler's during the rise of the Nazi party. Are you kidding me? This was a fantastic children's movie, not a secret agenda. How on earth could you possibly compare this movie to Hitler. That is completely ridiculous, you should be ashamed. You sound like a conspiracy theorist who is just full of hot air. Lion King like Hitler, ya and i suppose we never landed on the moon either. Simply a great movie. One of the best disney movies ever made.
0679411585|5.0|After reading several books on the Vietnam War, this is by far the best of all of them. If you loved the movie \\"We Were Soldiers\\", then you must read this book. It took General Hal Moore and Joe Galloway 10 years to gather all the research and all the facts to write the book on the battles of LZ X-Ray and LZ Albany. Both men were at X-Ray, with LtCol Moore Commanding the First Battalion of the Seventh Cavalry, and Joe Galloway as a young reporter for UPI, who himself picked up an M-16 during the intense battle. This book is a must read for military history buffs, and students.
B00005JOE8|5.0|I came out of the theater thinking to myself...wow hollywood can still produce a good movie. I LOVED this.I wanted to go back in immediatly and watch it again. This is worth every penny.The cinematography is amazing the film is in depth.. the characters are so believable. This is an awesome piece of work.Dont wait..go see it as soon as you can and be blown away just like i was. The political part of it is incredibly in parallel with our current world.The uprising was and is a fundamental part of the movie.. the awakening of a nation to the horrors a government like that can inflict on its nation ...with the premise of helping and protecting... meanwhile invading your personal life and choices and ultimatly trying to package it all up in a religious justification  that is rife through and through with lies... as anyone with any brain power would think also. Comendable...Amazing....Stunning... I cannot say enough about this !
B0009A1AS2|5.0|After years of hearing about these guys I finally picked up one of their cds, 'Octavarium'.  I'm impressed.<br /><br />These guys have it all.  Excellent muscianship, great melodies, great songs.<br /><br />As a lover of classic rock this is near perfect music to me.  The music is heavy but never falls victim to needless guitar shredding.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved the series and was very disappointed to find that it was not continued.  I bought the series because I could relate to Mal.

B000BYA5G4|2.0|I watched Lord of War starring Nicholas Cage last night. It sucked.<br /><br />I won't give away all the details in case you want to watch it for yourself. The acting is somewhat flat, but it's tolerable. What's truly sucky about the movie is the moral message - it's muddled. I'm not sure what the main message is. Perhaps the movie's creator was trying to say something meaningful about warfare, but I couldn't figure out what it was. Perhaps he wanted us all to believe that arms dealers are the source of all evil. Perhaps he wanted to ram home the message that the permanent members of the United Nations security council are also the world's largest arms dealers.<br /><br />The irony of making a movie portraying Western nations as the devils behind every third world war is that the most horrible scene in the movie is a scene in which a mother and son are hacked to death by a gang of thugs armed with machetes and the only man with a conscience about it is a Westerner. The whole movie is based on a fictional arms dealer played by Cage and a very loose intrepretation of a very real and very evil character named Charles Taylor, who at one time in the fairly recent past ruled Liberia.<br /><br />Lord of War sucks because it pushes the idea that the major militaries of the world are behind all the evil in the world when the truth is that evil exists mostly independent of those military forces. Some men, if given a rock, will use it to bash in the heads of anyone they can.<br /><br />In particular, the scene in which Nicholas Cage and his brother are meeting with a Sierra Leone warlord on a rise above a refugee camp was unrealistic. The scene shows a tent camp filled with unarmed Africans being circled by a single truck filled with machete wielding thugs. While Cage negotiates over a payment of \\"blood diamonds\\" for his two trucks filled with guns, RPGs and grenades, his brother watches a child try to escape the camp, followed by the mother. Both of them are hacked to death with machetes while curled up in a fetal position.<br /><br />The scene tugs at the emotional strings of anyone watching, but the premise of the scene is as flawed as the premise of the movie. Men with machetes and murderous intent don't need black market guns to kill a camp full of refugees. In real life, they'll use the machetes if that's all they have. In real life, Nicholas Cage would never have been able to negotiate his diamonds for guns deal above a refugee camp full of innocents waiting to be slaughtered. They would have been slaughtered prior to his arrival with whatever was available.<br /><br />Lord of War is based on the same flawed thinking that motivates anti-gun crusaders in the U.S. to try and outlaw personal weapons ownership. Blaming guns for what lives in the hearts and minds of men is silly, and doesn't solve any long-term problems of men killing other men. You don't build responsible, healthy societies by dumbing down the population and more than you do by killing anyone who disagrees with you.<br /><br />Lord of War shows us an inaccurate picture of war as it tries to blame all of Africa's problems on the West. There are no scenes showing British peacekeepers as they end the civil war in Sierra Leone. There are no scenes showing any of the centuries long history of tribal warfare that has gone on in the region. None of Liberia's history is put into context. All we are presented with is an amoral arms dealer and the impression that the U.S. government is behind all the violence in Africa because of shadowy arms deals and greedy profiteers. Taking pieces of the truth and rearranging them to fit your worldview is a dangerous business with far reaching consequences.<br /><br />You might want to watch Lord of War, but I would highly recommend researching the history of the larger events portrayed in the movie prior to doing so. In particular, I would recommend reading the full history of Liberia and Sierra Leone. The U.S. government has certainly been involved in the area for some time, but the real story is much more complex and layered than what we're shown in the movie.<br /><br />You can get some links and homework assignments related to this movie here, if you are interested in who is really to blame for some of the evil acts that have plagued Sierra Leone and Liberia for the last few decades - [...]as certainly been involved in the area for some time, but the real story is much more complex and layered than what we're shown in the movie. <br /> <br />You can get some links and homework assignments related to this movie here, if you are interested in who is really to blame for some of the evil acts that have plagued Sierra Leone and Liberia for the last few decades - [...]
B000088E6D|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD.  The music is well done, and Buble does a great job singing other people's songs.  While I generally don't like remakes of songs (or movies, for that matter), I enjoyed listening to Buble's voice.  The tunes are definitely catchy and I love his redition of \\"Sway\\". <br />I'd love to hear Buble sing something original, however.
B00064WSNM|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite KC album. As a drummer I appreciate what BB is trying to accomplish: musicality, tonality and melody. These terms not usually associated with the drumset but BB is a musician who plays percussion with the keyboard in mind.  He listens, anticipates, complements and defines passages.  For a better, more developed grasp of this concept check out his current band Earthworks. There is ample room and spacing; changes in speed, volume, textures.  I agree that this is Fripp's best KC work. The guitar sounds paint images of internal struggle. Not much light stuff here!  Wetton's bass is tight and musical. David Cross (violin) provides additional, mesmerizing sounds to Fripp's concerto.  Buy it, listen to it, pay close attention to sound details.  For drummers the lessons are simple: 1-music comes first; 2- breath; 3- listen carefully; 4- use the set in multiple conceptual ways; 5. play solid and clean.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|I absolutely enjoy waking up to Michael Buble singing \\"Feeling Good\\"! <br /> <br />That aside, his style remains consistant from his debut CD, and his  versions of other people's music is as good or better than the originals. <br /> <br />I enjoy his Bobby Darin/Frank Sinatra-esque voice, and would love to hear something entirely his own.
B0002OERI0|1.0|AAAAHHHHHH! My ears! 95% of everything on the radio today is off this album, and this album SUCKS! I would like to attack the person who said that Green Day is a \\"one of a kind band\\". You've gotta be f-in kidding me. If you knew anything about rock music and it's history you would know that punk has been around since the 70's. Green Day are a complete rip off of not very well known and much better punk band from the 80's called the Descendents, listen to their music and you will see obvious similarities. Anyway, why am I wasting time here, I don't even like punk that much, much less Green Day. Green Day sucks, goodbye...<br /><br />P.S.-I don't hate this because I'm a Republican, in fact, I'm actually pretty liberal, and if you ask me, Bush sucks almost as much as Green Day :)!
B00005JNTX|4.0|Great movie.This has three different<br /><br />stories to it and each one is very<br /><br />entertaining,the black and white<br /><br />effect looks great except for the<br /><br />blood.The things I thought were<br /><br />a bit stupid was one of the bad guys<br /><br />was orange and it took like fourty shots<br /><br />with a gun to kill someone.Other than that<br /><br />its a great movie with an awesome cast.

B00000G3AZ|4.0|I am such an enthusiastic JA fan that I enjoy different versions of her works. Gwyneth Paltrow does terrific work here as Emma. This version may a bit more \\"glamorous\\" than the BBC version but it also brings in more of the humorous side as well. Delightfully done.
B00000255F|5.0|If ever there was proof that Springsteen was a poet then look no further.  This album was written back when I was a mere 4 years old and I have yet to find lyrics that move me as much as this WHOLE album still does to this day.  This was only the fourth BOSS album I purchased but is a benchmark for anyone new to his music.  I have not yet been fortunate to experience the man live (I must be jinxed as he always sells out before I get a look in), however, his singular poetry and insite into the the thoughts and feelings of the everyday man (upto this very day) continue to move, inspire and provoke that which moves us most deeply.<br /><br />Thankyou Bruce.<br /><br />If you haven't had the priveledge, introduce yourself to (and find out why they call him) THE BOSS!!!
B000002UVX|1.0|Why waste your cash on this? The double CD Hendrix Live at Fillmore East has the the most complete recorded audio of the TWO concerts Hendrix and Band of Gypsys did for New Years' 1969. It's also remastered and rules since you get more of Buddy Miles' tracks. The DVD Band of Gypsys is a nice companion piece. Forget the single disc, it's only a piece of catalog for another record company that doesn't do justice to the shows.
B000E97HIA|4.0|For years the only Prince album I owned, like a lot of people, was \\"Purple Rain\\". Within the past few years though I've been exploring his back catalog. Was curious to hear what he was doing now and picked up \\"3121\\" based on his performance of \\"Fury\\" on SNL this past winter. That song is certainly a highlight. Other highlights for me would be \\"Black Sweat\\", \\"Lolita\\", \\"Beautiful, Loved & Blessed\\", and of course \\"Fury\\". The rest of the album is growing on me too. For fans of \\"Purple Rain\\" era Prince, this isn't really that sound. The sound today is very funky, very R&B and for some of you it may not be your thing. But if you do venture into this disc, you will find yourself getting into it.
B000002LMM|5.0|An amazing score to an amazing show. The music is a blend of 50's pop music, modern jazz and I don't know what else. It just works. Its quircky, fun, mysterious and melodic. Julie Cruise sounds like an angel. It is the perfect voice for this material. David Lynch lyrics are great.  I love it!
B00004XQ83|4.0|I have never been a fan of this kind of music however, I was recently exposed to it and quite liked it. Having heard this CD while visiting my daughter at Christmas time I decided it was a necessary addition to my CD collection. I don't see myself becoming a full fledged enthusiast of this type of music but it is a fun listen and very well done.
B000005H3A|5.0|This album is pure gold.  Dexter Gordon and Freddie Hubbard take some of the most melodic and beautiful solos in the history of recorded jazz- not to mention Herbie's solos, where he introduces the left hand as a significant tool for improvisation (with the exception of a few, i.e. Art Tatum, Bud Powell, the left hand served more of a straight comping role, where as herbie develops his rhythmic technique to bring jazz piano to a whole new level). Listen to the solos on Driftin and Maze.  Sheer genius.  If you haven't heard this album, purchase it immediately.  It is a must-hear for anyone even remotely interested in jazz.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|When 30 Seconds to Mars first came out, i was quick to buy their cd. Im a HUGE music buff, and it seemed like it would be cool (and of course it was on the $9.95 rack at the PX, so those are the best for a new soldier who loves music and doesnt have much $$$). So i bought it and was quite impressed. However, at the time i wasnt into this type. Now that im older and more open minded, i bought the new album, \\"A Beautiful Lie\\". I was blown away. Truly a masterpiece! I can feel pieces of many bands in their songs (IE David Bowie, U2, Skillet, Staind, Tool,Nirvana).<br /><br />1: Attack - I LOVE the intro, its just great to say the least. And i love songs that kick in like \\"Attack\\" does. I dont think they could have made a better album starter song. I myself and in a screamo/metal band, so I can ALWAYS appreciate a good scream too! The lyrics are great, and im giving it a 4.5/5<br /><br />2: A Beautiful Lie - Probably my FAVORITE song off of this cd. It's got a great little bass part, and i always appreciate a good song that uses little soloesque things with each instrument. And even though the guitars are very basic, the song is just so \\"beautiful\\". I caught a little Filter and Skillet in this one! This whole song came together so great that it gets a 5/5!<br /><br />3: The Kill - Nice fade-in begining. I love the guitars and the lyrics. This is not one of my favorite songs, but it, much like the others, is still great! 3/5<br /><br />4: Was it a Dream - Once again, awesome intro, the drums and rain are great, then the guitars come in (reminds me of Staind or Nirvana!). Im REALLY feeling some U2 from the singer, i get alot of that in this CD. Its strange too because i hate U2! But i LOVE this song. It's probably the softest song, but it all comes together perfect. 5/5<br /><br />5: The Fantasy - Haha, the bass is AWESOME! when the guitars come in, they remind me of something i bet they dont to most, 36 Crazyfists. The singer is giving me a MAD David Bowie vibe, and i LOVE Bowie! then some \\"yeah, yeah!\\" Manson style, and some total overall Mad at Gravity (sorry, i know too many bands and i can always reference every band to another!). I love how he treats this song, like hes not even singing, just telling you whats up! Another one of my favs off of this cd! 5/5!!!\<br /><br />6: Savior - This is another big U2 type song. I like the almost offbeat drums, its quite lovely! :D I can really feel the desperation in the lyrics, tragic, but wonderful. 3.5/5<br /><br />7: From Yesterday - Im a sucker for pianos or keys in songs, first off! I am actually stuck on this one, i cant remember who they remind me of, but i know i love it! the chorus is extremely powerful and emotional. and GOD i just cant get over the piano! :D 5/5<br /><br />8: The Story - Thank God for Nirvana-ish guitar intros! Great, great, great! I don't really like the begining lyrics, but thats up to you to decide for you! This song is really slow-down-and-think-about-what-youre-doing. It's a good song to just sit and have a smoke to, or just a good song to listen to while in deep thought! And of course, if you listen hard enough you can hear something along the lines of a Xylophone in the background! :D 5/5<br /><br />9: R-Evolve - Nice guitar intro, vocals come in wonderfully clean and soft. I feel a little Cobain in his voice. This song is another of the more emotional off of this CD, its fantastic. I love the use of the Toms, most of the time it seems like drummers dont use theirs! :( 4/5<br /><br />10: A Modern Myth - Seriously, what cd is good without an acoustic song?! This is a great acoustic song to boot! Very basic and plain, but affective. And the violins are magnificent, i love it! :D  5/5<br /><br />11: Battle of One - I can hear ALOT of older Filter in this song! I LOVE the harder beat and faster attack on the song. The chorus is magnificent, as are the lyrics! Another of my favorites off of this cd! It has everything, a Tool breakdown towards the end, Synthwork, fast beat, screaming... the dream of a metal head! :D 5/5<br /><br />12: Hunter - Crazy sounds, good bass line in the back of the techno beat. Some David Bowie feeling again. The singer gives a really calm, but totally in your face feeling to the song. The lyrics are a little strange, but the song is still great! 4/5<br /><br />Quick fix for the \\"wont play on my computer\\" guy. Open up my computer, and open the CD Drive. Once inside, open up the file \\"PlayCDS\\", and it will bring up the Autoplay file.al head! :D 5/5 <br />12: Hunter - Crazy sounds, good bass line in the back of the techno beat.

B00006AVRK|5.0|If you enjoy reading the Jeeves novels, you will love the DVDs. I was a little afraid to spend the money on DVDs for books that I had already read, but I am certainly glad I did. The shows stay very true to the books, but seeing them on the screen is a totally different experience. I love to read, but have found myself watching this series every night just like reading a book you can't put down. I think you will really enjoy watching this series.

B00005O5CM|4.0|\\"Legally Blonde\\" starring Reese Witherspoon is escapism fluff, but it never tries to be anything more than that and maybe for that reason, it succeeds and is two hours of fun. <br />Elle Woods, a blonde sorority sister majoring in fashion design, and newly dumped by her boyfriend, Warner, decides that in order to win him back she must follow him to Harvard Law School.  Upon arriving at Harvard, she finds that Warner has a new fiancee, the more appropriate Vivian (Selma Blair), and that her blonde perkiness makes her an outsider.  She makes friends with the shy manicurist in town (Jennifer Coolidge) with her own man problems, and finds an ally in Emmett (Luke Wilson), an associate who works with one of her professors. <br />What makes this movie work is Reese Witherspoon.  Her Elle is so likable - - she is ditzy, yes, but in a good natured way, and her heart is in the right place.  And by the end, she is proven to be smart and intelligent.   <br />While the movie suffers from some cases of unreality (would Elle REALLY get into Harvard?), those cases seem relatively small while enjoying the movie.  \\"Legally Blonde\\" doesn't pretend to be a serious and deep thinking movie, simply a fun comedy that is easy on the senses and worthy of two hours' enjoyment.
0385510454|1.0|This is the most boring book I have read in a very long time.  I read the entire novel waiting for something exciting to happen and it never did.  Nothing happens in this book ever, not even at the end.  I think Grisham had better take some lessons on intrigue writing from Robert Ludlum or go back to what he does best.  The editors also should read a novel before they publish it and not assume it will be great just because of the author.  Don't waste you time or money.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Vincente Minnelli has so many wonderful classic films that it is hard to chose one as  the best. But this one, regardless of its sheer quality -which is extraordinary-, has an added value if possible: to me it's THE American movie \\"par excellence\\". It represents middle-America, the common folks, the traditional America, the values, the family as the basic social unit. For this reason it is also so saddening: because it's an extinct America; for we cannot deny  the truth, the US is not like this anymore at all.<br /><br />It amazes me every time I watch this movie, how simple a story can captivate like the most convoluted crime story. This is the greatness of the classic directors like Minnelli.<br /><br />All the members in the family are marvelous. The movie can be viewed as many times as members in the family there are, and by focusing our attention on each one of them. Of course the first time you watch it you will probably observe more attentively the youngest daughter, but I recommend paying attention to all the characters, they are all lovely and different at the same time.<br /><br />I have to admit that in some classic musicals, sometimes I would rather skip the song and go right to the story. No way in this one. Even when there is no music it feels like there is, such is the natural flow of the scenes. Amazing.<br /><br />Mandatory viewing.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|If you are reading this review chances are that you already know what this movie is about, what is important, and why I think it was so successful, is what you get from it. For me this movie is about two ver common human emotions that even tough are very different every human been has experience them. <br />Love.- Is very difficult to find the love of your life in this world, everybody is in a hurry and sometimes we missed the changes we have for fear, so these guys dont getting together for fear is very sad, this kind of love is rare and when Ennis found those shirts he knows how much he was loved, Jack having the oportunity to leave never did it because as the saying goes Love is a force of nature and difficul to explain. <br />Loliness.- Even more common than love is loneliness, maybe not everyone has been in love but everyone has feel lonely in this love, so many people but again that loliness can kill you, and in a way that was happened whit these guys, Jack felt loliness since Ennis never had the courage of loving together and Ennis was left alone and with regret when Jack suddenly died, the last scene of the movie shows so much loneliness and regret that is overwhelming. <br />I hate that this movie, a really love story, was so attacked and make fun of, can we grow up and see this as a variation of a love story? Sorry for all that did give themselves the changes to see this Masterpiece, since watching straight love stories does not make a gay person straight, seeinng this movie will not make anyone gay, but will leave thinking about your own life and the choices you have made.. Enjoy!

B000EGDC14|5.0|I've been a fan since the beginning. This is a culmination/continuation of the first two albums and it's just perfect. Great pop that references and respects T. Rex, Gary Numan, Moroder, Kraftwerk... It sounds great on radio or a party but the real treat is on headphones. Production is velvet. And I've had the import for months - just gets better and more infectious. The special edition is well worth it. And I saw them on their teaser show in NYC at Nokia Theater. They rocked. (it was a star studded affair and i saw some big stars with mouths dropped) Wind machine companies owe Alison royalties. Enjoy!

You just need a 70-300mm to complement the series ! However i am skeptical about the 70-300mm IS as some reviews say it gets blurry in portrait.
1400062071|5.0|All is not as it appears in 1959 in the small town of West Annett, Maine. Invisible currents beneath the surface sweep through the townspeople, including Reverend Tyler Caskey. His rather flamboyant and controversial wife has died, leaving behind two young daughters. Jeannie, the baby, goes to live with her grandmother but five-year-old Katherine, a troubled child, remains with her father. She doesn't speak, screams for her kindergarten teacher's constant attention, and has no friends. <br /> <br />Although his parishioners look up to him and constantly seek his counsel, Tyler himself has no true friends --- certainly no one with whom to share his daughter's difficulties. When Mary Ingersoll, Katherine's teacher, calls him in to divulge Katherine's problems, Tyler is befuddled. Mary mistakes his confusion for antagonism, and she is quick to confide in other women in town. <br /> <br />Tyler's congregation keeps secrets: a hotel tryst for one member, suspicion of burglary for another, while a third member confides that her husband hits her. Many of the secrets in West Annett are entrusted to Tyler, who earnestly tries to help his flock while protecting their confidences. Tyler himself has secrets, including the beginning of a warm connection between himself and his married housekeeper, Connie Hatch, which has the potential for an eventual genuine friendship. Speaking with Connie becomes more and more a focal point for Tyler to anticipate with pleasure during the course of the day. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the townswomen gossip about the wild behavior of little Katherine Caskey and the rude behavior of her father during the teacher/parent conference with Mary Ingersoll. Subtly the animosity between Tyler and Mary escalates even as feelings of attraction strengthen between Tyler and Connie. <br /> <br />Tyler's relationship with his stern mother becomes more difficult when he makes plans to bring his baby home to live with him. The two young daughters will be cared forduring the day by Connie. Tyler's mother objects, complaining that Connie is uneducated and strange and would be an inappropriate caretaker. She sets Tyler up with a woman she considers a suitable replacement for his wife as simultaneously bizarre circumstances snatch Connie out of reach. <br /> <br />Tyler's life is not what he expected nor could he ever have predicted he'd harbor the kind of dark secret he lives with, as his life crumbles apart around him. Despite his faith, his existence more and more resembles the ramshackle parsonage he lives in --- painted pink inside yet in dire disrepair. <br /> <br />Elizabeth Strout is brilliant at characterization; she strikes no false notes. Tyler Caskey is a richly tormented, many layered, and sympathetic main character. In fact, there is not one shallow stereotype in the entire cast. Her descriptive powers pack a potent wallop. The plot is leisurely, and properly so: a breathlessly fast-paced plot would do a disservice to the subtle personality studies and transformations in ABIDE WITH ME. The story's conclusion is both completely unexpected and utterly satisfying. I highly recommend this powerful, lyrical novel of sorrow, faith and redemption. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)
B000E97HIA|5.0|This is another brilliant and colorful assortment of musical genius sugar coated with a combo of funk, jazz, rock, blues....you name it....the purple one always manages to combine a collective mixture of sounds that are unique and coherant.  This masterpiece is pure ear candy.  Although it does not match up to his earlier works of art, 3121 is still deliciously appetizing.  Another artful composition to add to his harmonious musical catalog.  He is truly an unparalleled artist, performer, and musician.  No other celebrity has the charisma and stage presence like Prince.  He welcomes a wide spectrum of musical genres in his work aside from country, however I think it would be interesting if he did dapple a little into the honky tonk arena.  3121 is a definite must have.
B0000025AI|5.0|I have always been a big Johnny Winter fan and I will give this 5 stars.Great guitar riffs.  Johnny gets back to the blues without the rock 'n roll.
B0002IQJUK|4.0|This is just some good guitar based pop music. Good hooks throughout with some outstanding vocal work. My only complaint comes on the \\"Stripped\\" cd. I was hoping it would be TRULY stripped down to acoustic guitar and vocals with maybe some piano. Unfortunately it includes a drum and bass track that I feel overpowers the music. Don't get me wrong, it is still good, especially with the different take on the vocals and different inflections in his voice, BUT, how much better it would have been to hear Gavin's voice with just an acoustic guitar.
B00003CY0V|2.0|There is 1 reason for you.  This is a movie about a guy who is a really crazy big-time bank robber who like to go out and hae gunfights in his snazzy car.<br /><br />Nothing works for me in this movie except hugh jackmon, and halle berry of course.  His character does have a lot of good backround elements about him.  But the way they use him and his family was just stupid, just like evrything else in the movie, except for halle berry.  I wish that this movie had it's finer points, well I guess there are 2 pretty good scenes with halle berry, one more pleasing than the other.  But the stunts were the stupidest thing.  You can tell what this movie was supposed to be about, halle berry,but besides that this is just a movie where a bus is being helicoptered all over the city.  I had heard about this when it came out and it didn't intrigue me at all, but then my friend told me that this is halle's berry best movie and I had to go see it.  So he wasn't lying, it is my favorite role that she has ever played, but the stunts and whole bank robbery thing was just retarded.<br /><br />I can't remember if I brought up halle berry in this review yet so I would like to take the oppurtunity right now to say I love you halle berry and just give me a call sometime.

B000089RVX|5.0|Ok, I'm gonna be very honest. I've never been a person with a big music taste. A few years ago, i only listen to music in the radio or on tv, i have never bought a CD, and this was \\"THE\\" album, that take me into all the music scene, that's the truth. <br />I was just paralized when i saw Bring Me To Life for the first time on TV, I really LOVED IT. <br />A few months later I bought the album, and i listen to it over and over again, I loved the sound, Amy's beautiful voice, the emotional lyrics...I can't really explain how that happened, but this really get me into all music scene, and today, i listen everyday in my CD player a lot of different kind of music, that I learned to love, because Evanescence music make me wanna feel music. <br /> <br />Well, talking about Fallen. it's Rock. Melodic Rock. Catchy, not very complex, and it's beautiful music. There's no need of 50.000 choirs, instruments, vocals, etc, etc..Simple music is beautiful and this album really is. I love Imaginary. It's my favourite one, and I love Whisper too. All the songs have something special, I like all of them. <br />It's not a masterpiece, neither the best album for me, but it was this that makes me wanna hear music, and discover new artists. <br />And I still love it!

B000059ZLH|1.0|Standard disclaimer: I LOVE Dream Theater. <br /> <br />However, this DVD is almost unbearable to watch due to all of the video effects that obscure the live performance. Didn't I buy a DVD of Dream Theater live so that I could see them play?? At times, several minutes pass without showing the musicians as they're playing. <br /> <br />Video effects such as swirling colors, images of the artists upside down (?!?), and black and white re-enactments make the whole affair feel like someone was trying to create their first music video for MTV in 1984. Or maybe trying to induce an epileptic seizure in the viewer?? <br /> <br />Dream Theater would get a rating of 1000, but I'd give this DVD a 0 if I could. Just goes to show what poor editing gets you.

Afterwards, Genesis and the eventall solo career of Phil Collins just wasn't the same as with these earlier recordings of Genesis. Like radio stations changing formats..just not the same anymore. <br /> <br />
1400082773|5.0|<br /> <br />I could not put this book down.  Maybe it was because I am also in public service but something about that man's life was really intriguing.  He was rich in culture (found culture), family and most of all, rich of thoughts and questions.  Those questions he had are questions that many Americans have whether they're black or white and getting them answered by his experiences make it that much better.   <br /> <br />Like the other readers, I would have like to read more about his experiences at Harvard and also how he got to be a US Senator but I'm sure there will be future books.  I hope to see him as a presidential candidate in the future.  <br />
B000002GK1|5.0|If you haven't heard of this album, then your living under a rock.  If you know who Chris Cornel is buy this album.  This is a great album, all the songs are very good, the greats Jesus Christ Pose, Rusty Cage, I could go on.  Soundgarden blows away Audio Slave in my opinion but I grew up listening to this album and all the other Soundgarden ablums.
B000002NCW|5.0|If you like this album by Mike - try also beautiful magestic folk music music recorded by Orison, William Coulter, Shelley Phillips!!!    As to \\"Voyager\\" itself - I had heard this album for the first time in 1996 and I was dissapointed - after \\"The Songs of Distant Earth\\" you should wait for more... But artist has his own free will, so he could do whatever he wants.  If you like folky Mike Oldfield (\\"Ommadawn\\") - probably you would like this album. Here Mike plays Celtic music with London Symphony Orchestra, live highland bagpipes - so sound is quite live, spectacular and \\"big\\" - it`s not quite a meditative new age record.  If you like rocky Mike (\\"Shadow on the Wall\\") or electronic Mike (\\"The Songs of Distant Earth\\", \\"Light+Shade\\") - you would be disappointed - you have to be in the mood to listen to folk style music without any elements of rock dramatisism or electronic sound effects. The main effect here is Mike playing guitar. So when I`m in this mood - I like this CD. It is not the best work by Oldfield but it is interesting music with the distinctive sound of guitar by Mike.
B000E97HIA|5.0|I have been a huge fan since 1979 and I want to share my complete thoughts on this CD. <br /> <br />There aren't any cd's out now that you can play straight through but 3121, I can play from start to finish.  My favorite tracks that I keep replaying over and over are 3121, Lolita, Black Sweat, and The Dance.  He has shown over and over that he reigns in this music business.  Prince is phenomenal and a musical genius no doubt.  I totally recommend this cd to even people who aren't Prince fans.  Move over Musicology cd, 3121 Rocks!!!!!!!!!
B000059XUO|5.0|Even after not seeing it for all those years, still  give it a 10! <br />It was great to be able to find the movie through Amazon.com!! I had looked for a couple of years at other places and sites! <br />So thanks!!
B000089CKH|5.0|I'm not a big fan of pop, but I am a fan of the pop songs out there that are done with craftmanship.  My review isn't even based on the entire album since all I have going for me is a \\"Blonde On Blonde\\" mp3 and a \\"Blizzard of '77\\" sound clip.  But I have to say BOB is the most contagious and dreamy pop song I've heard in some time.  I've named it my most recent #1 download on my blog even though it is a few years old now.  I've probably listened to the Blizzard sound clip about 50 times.  I must be crazy!  But I haven't heard a hook this addicting since maybe never.  When the acoustic stops strumming momentarily for Matthew Caws to sing, \\"I know I have got a negative edge that is why I sharpen all the others alot!/It's like flowers, or lady bugs pretty weeds or red beatles with dots!\\", I completely lose it.  You have to hear him sing to the music to appreciate the beauty and art in the lyrical line.  It's the same reason why Death Cab for Cutie jumped up into the indie spotlight if you will.  The clarity in vocal and instrumentation is hats off.  Caws isn't going to blow the roof off with his voice, but even better he has an effortless and smooth delivery.  I think he is quite undervalued as a singer.    My tastes say Nada Surf has yet to prove themselves as a consistently solid band.  But it doesn't matter because I forgive them for what they have accomplished on Popular (and the classic video), Blonde On Blonde, and Blizzard of '77.  Thank you gentlemen.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I watched this movie many times and I am deeply thankful to God for such a testimony of his love and mercy on sinners. The cross of Jesus is the heart of the gospel and the resurrection is the power of God to save us. Mel Gibson got it right this time. The acting is great and the movie is truly heartwarming and makes you think about the truth of Christ. This movie is truly a Christian epic.
1932100385|1.0|First I will say that some of the results in the author's lab pertaining to milk protein and cancer are interesting, if the book were the milk study and didn't go into meaningless details and rambling, I would have no problem with the book. Some details are important and some are just used to unnecessarily stretch a book.    <br /> <br />I have been wishing for years that a study like this book described in it's write up was available.  Nutrition patterns and health fascinate me, especially in a country like China with different eating patterns.  So naturally I couldn't wait to get this book.  I got it and kept reading and reading, I was up to page 70 and was starting to get mad at what I perceived as the stretching of the book.  It really irks me when writers take 2 pages to say something that I could have said in a sentence or two.  Instead of 400 pages this book could have been written in 100 easy.  But I trudged on trying to get to the fascinating study, but I never found what I expected.  There was a map of China showing the different regions with heavy disease areas.  But I never found a key that said what the diet of those different areas were.  In fact \\"very\\" little if any thing was said about eating patterns in China, all of the graphs that I remember were comparing the America to other countries around the world.  I am shocked at all the 5 star ratings, I can't figure how we see it so differently.  It would have been fascinating if it had broke down the provinces and told what their protein source was, % of diet it was, % fat, etc.  That is what this book should have been about.  <br />
B00005JOE8|4.0|In the England of 2020, dictator Adam Sutler (Hurt) rules with an iron fist.  Citizens live in fear of him and his regime.  One man who stands against him in a mysterious figure that goes by the name \\"V\\" (Weaving).  Hidden behind a Guy Fawkes mask, he seeks to inspire the people.  Evey (Portman) is saved by V one night when she is backed into a corner by Sutler's men.  Then he invites her to a viewing of a \\"performance\\" that he has arranged...the blowing up of the Old Bailey.  He gives the government one year before he goes after parliament, and asks the citizens to stand up with him.<br /><br />\\"V for Vendetta\\" is an interesting enough movie that is an attempt to not so subtly mirror current events.  This is somewhat of a mistake, as it will alienate some of the audience.  Also, the hero is a terrorist, who resorts to torture of an innocent to further his goals.  Weaving does a good job as V, especially since you do not see his face throughout the entire movie.  Portman does a passable job as Evie, but is nothing spectacular.  \\"V\\" will give the viewer something to think about, and is not your standard comic book movie.  This is definately one of the better movies to come out so far this year though, and that may be reason enough to see it.

Yet, there are those moments in every episode when I see the actors address real human emotions and frustrations.

0553108034|5.0|Great follow up to the second book!! If you like adventure sci fi action it has everything and more!!!
B00005JNQA|2.0|I went to see this film hoping to see a riveting, suspense thriller. While the idea behind the story had a great deal of promise the film comes across as sluggish, not well edited and the characters are too grandiose.<br /><br />As the film chugs along it always is trying to be like a \\"Classic Movie\\" you'd see on AMC/TCM and it loses itself. It could have been a great move if it was just written and directed more for the \\"here and now\\". Instead it tries too much to be like a \\"Classic\\" and just misses its mark
B00006RCOB|5.0|it was one of very impressive movies which i've watched. <br />i'm very touched by clint eastwood's acting. <br />
B00000DHRX|5.0|Great CD. I don't write many CD reviews but I'll glady spend the time praising this man for all he has accomplished over the years. \\"Careless Whisper\\" is one of the songs that would be in the soundtrack of my life. Highest play count on Itunes, definitly an artist who I have come to respect through my alcohol + college years.
B000002G87|5.0|As a teenager, I went through many changes and transitions...the major one being the music I was into. I always had a thing for the Beatles, the Counting Crows and the Grateful Dead, but in my early teens, mainly ages 13-15, I was heavily into hip hop in all forms. That is, until this album made its way into my life. <br /> <br />Eric Clapton has always fascinated me. As a songwriter, he can make heartbreak and love sound perfect in words. As a guitarist, he was the best. I'll give Hendrix and Duane Allman their due, because they deserve it. They were the best. But sadly, they did not get to live to keep topping themselves. And in my eyes, that made Clapton the all-time best, even in the poorer albums. That was one reason why this album impressed me. <br /> <br />But it's much more than impression. I got into this album by sheer chance. My father had always had it on in the car when I was littler. And when I had the chorus of \\"It's Too Late\\" stuck in my head one day, but couldn't figure out what song it was from, my father helped me out, and he explained to me how important this album was to him. He said it was the one and only album he can ever remember going out to buy on the day it was released. And my father owns a lot of albums. That made an impact on me. He also told me the gist of the story behind it, which you probably know (Clapton's unrequitted love for George Harrison's, his best friend's, wife.) And he gave me this album to listen to, because \\"It's Too Late\\" was stuck in my head. <br /> <br />I can remember it exactly. It was a cold, tuesday morning in October of 2003. I was sitting on the school bus, with this album blaring in my headphones, and I don't know how i refrained from breaking down and crying. Not two months earlier, I had experienced my first bout of heartbreak, when the girl I loved commited infidelity and broke my heart. We were still together, but it hurt everytime I saw her. And this album made it better. I couldn't stop listening to this album. I just couldn't. Every song was perfect, and every song helped me out in its own way. <br /> <br />I won't describe my feelings on each song, because no one has the time for that. I will however mention my favorite tracks, and why. First and foremost, \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" may be the saddest, most powerful, teary-eyed, bottom of the bottle song I've ever heard. When Clapton and Bobby Whitlock wail in anguish on the pre chorus and chorus, I got chills up my spine, and not only on first listen. \\"Keep on Growing\\" and \\"Anyday\\" always seemed to stick with me as well. (I have the lyrics for \\"Keep on Growing\\" taped above my bed.) It's odd that both are upbeat-sounding (even though \\"Anyday\\"s desperate, longing, and in one part suicidal lyrics could crush any man), yet both make excellent heartbreak music. \\"Keep on Growing\\" is just such a great love song. It's amazing that Clapton wrote a song like that what with all he was going through. Also, Bobby Whitlock's soulful voice gets to be heard solo on the pre-chorus of \\"Keep on Growing\\", and on the second verse of \\"Anyday\\". \\"Key to the Highway\\" might be the most impressive guitar playing I've ever heard. Clapton and Allman on one album together is amazing, so when each is duelling solos with eachother, you know it's gonna be good. And finally, the title track \\"Layla\\" is one of the greatest singles ever released. It goes from a rock song, into an insane jam, crescending right before the ease-off into the most beautiful piano piece you could hope for. It's sad that Jim Gordon, who was a skilled drummer and wrote that piano piece, is in prison for life, but that's a different story. <br /> <br />While each of these songs may have lifted my spirit, the album as a whole touched my life. It got me into more classic rock, more blues, more Clapton, more Allman. It really did change my life. Whenever I have a bad day, I know that waiting for me when I get home, or one click away on my mp3 player, is this album. I keep a copy ofthe vinyl propped up on my nightstand next to my bed, because I wanted a poster of the album artwork (what an amazing cover photo! and I absolutely LOVE the pictures in the liner notes) and that's as close as I can get to displaying the album's image to anyone who enters my room. <br /> <br />I hope this, in it's entirely rambling way, inspires at least one person to buy this album. Whether you're looking for ease from the pain of love, the best rock record ever, or just simply amazing musicianship and well-written and played songs from five musicians who should have stayed together forever, pick up a copy of this album. It will do something for you. I've listened to so much music in every genre I can find since my transition from hip hop head to general music lover, and I will always tell anyone, without a doubt, that this album is now, and always will be, my favorite album of all time.
B000002HJR|5.0|It's been over 10 years, and I've listened to a LOT of music, but this is one of the top 5 albums I keep coming back to. It's rough, dirty, but the music production is clean and perfect. If it were a dessert, it would be a big old bowl of ice cream with nougaty topping.. smooth production, chunky top. Just simply one of the best, no pretentious crap, just hard, chewy, nougaty, rough goodness!!
B000024QML|5.0|When I say pop, I don't mean the packaged bubble gum on the radio today in the form of the Pussycat Dolls or Gwen Stefani, but finely crafted songs designed to appeal to a wide audience. The great thing is, is that the Boys retain intelligence and respectability despite such an obvious attempt to create hits, as they usually seem to do. These are brilliant songs, no question, and virtually every song could have been a hit. The caveat with this disc is that it is hopelessly dated, which is not good if you're trying to appeal to a wide populous programmed to buy the 'new thing'. Don't let the computerized beeps and bops turn you off, as there is a wide array of genius hooks, clever and thought-provoking lyrics, and lush sonic soundscapes to please any true music-lovers ear. It is just completely tragic that mindless songs like 'Don't Cha' get all the hype in North America, while the Pet Shop Boys are ignored.
B00005JO9J|4.0|I liked, but I thouth that better than I watch.
B000002MZ9|3.0|Neil Young's \\"Mirror Ball\\" was released in June of 1995, and it got a considerable amount of hype at the time, mostly due to the presence of the then-current lineup of Pearl Jam.  Considering that, with the possible exception of Nirvana, Pearl Jam were the most high-profile grunge-rock band of the early '90s, and Neil Young had become known as the \\"godfather of grunge\\", the pairing was bound to set expectations high.<br /><br />With Pearl Jam at the time being signed to Epic Records and Neil to Warner/ Reprise, this created legal complications, and it explains why the album is credited solely to Neil Young instead of \\"Neil Young & Pearl Jam\\".  Despite the Pearl Jam backing, as well as the production from Pearl Jam producer Brendan O'Brien, this is still very much a Neil Young album--apart from additional lyrics by Eddie Vedder on \\"Peace And Love\\", Neil has sole songwriting crediting for everything here; and the record is done up in Young's typical rough 'n' ready warts-and-all fashion, recorded entirely on four different dates, with lots of Neil's characteristic noisy guitar soloing and feedback.  Plus, you'd never even guess that Eddie Vedder, Pearl Jam's mouthpiece, was in the studio while this was being recorded, apart from his brief spotlight on the aforementioned \\"Peace And Love\\", and so it's not surprising that, performance-wise, Vedder is only credited for background vocals, and Neil himself made it clear that Vedder wasn't very involved in the recording process.<br /><br />On the positive side... The album-opening \\"Song X\\" is brilliant, a spellbinding 3/4 time rocker with a sea chantey-style singalong chorus and devastating guitar breaks from Neil.  The relentless, looping 4-chord rocker \\"I'm The Ocean\\" works marvelously--it's a uniquely moving and emotional song, masterfully punctuated by organ and dreamy piano.  And the rocker \\"Big Green Country\\" has soaring 'B' sections and another great Neil solo.<br /><br />However, a lot of the music feels like it wasthrown together quickly, and the album does suffer a lot as a result.  \\"Downtown\\", for instance, is a dull, throwaway three-chord rocker with lame lyrics about the \\"hippie dream\\" of the late '60s/ early '70s.  And the two-chord, 8+ minute \\"Scenery\\" is tiring, with a lot of loud, yet lethargic pounding.  Too often, it seems like they're trying and failing to mask underdeveloped songwriting with sheer volume, \\"Act Of Love\\" and the sugary \\"Peace And Love\\" being further examples.<br /><br />Also a drawback to the album is the drumming from Jack Irons.  He often sounds like someone who's just started to play and yet wants the world to know how great he is.  Just listen to the album's uptempo tracks in succession--\\"I'm The Ocean\\", \\"Big Green Country\\", and \\"Throw Your Hatred Down\\"--and it really becomes apparent how his drumming tends to sound annoyingly samey, unimaginative, and passionless, like he's just coasting through his performances.<br /><br />If you haven't already done so, \\"Mirror Ball\\" is definitely worth picking up cheap for Neil fans.  There is some great stuff here for sure, but overall this teaming up with Pearl Jam is sadly underwhelming.
B0002DB50E|2.0|OK, Videodrome is a thought-provoking sleazy sci-fi classic that is far better received (and understood) today than it was during its initial release. BUT I'm fairly certain that a large portion of people who have seen this movie have seen it because \\"Blondie\\" is in it. Like the film itself, Debbie Harry's legacy has grown considerably since the time when this movie was released. So, since this is the big fancy \\"Criterion Collection\\" DVD, one would think that they would serve up the extra and alternate segments which can be seen on the TV version of Videodrome shown on on Sci-Fi etc.. which feature many more scenes with Debbie - But no, instead they give us the same version thats been in circulation since the days of VHS! They don't even include the extra scenes as bonus material. What a waste! Unless you are really anxious to hear James Woods commentary (Debbie's on there too, but doesn't talk too much) then I would save myself the extra $25 and just buy the old DVD version.
B000B0WODA|4.0|\\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" sounds a lot like Franz Ferdinand's first album.  There are the same dancey rhythms, overdriven vocals, and catchy songs.  The formula have enough in it for two good albums.  If anything, I think this one is a little better than the first.  It's a little more consistant, there aren't any songs to fast-forward past. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000E33VWW|5.0|A mixture of biography and historical drama, \\"Capote\\" focuses on one of the pivotal events in Truman Capote's life; the research and writing of his novel  In Cold Blood and the impact that it had on his art but, more importantly, on his life. When a farm family is murdered in a seemingly random act of violence in the state of Kansas Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman who deservedly picked up an Academy Award for his performance) convinces his publisher to send him to uncover what exactly happened. Taking along Harper Lee (played by Catherine Keener, Lee was the author of To Kill a Mockingbird) as his research assistant Capote finds people and a culture that won't embrace him making his investigation difficult. Eventually Capote strikes up a friendship with FBI agent Alvin Dewey in charge of catching the killers (Academy Award winner Chris Cooper). Once the killers Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.)are caught Capote tries to find anyway possible to interview them for his story. He finds himself increasing drawn to Perry Smith a young, artistic individual who reminds Capote of a mirror image of himself. As Capote remarks, \\"it's like we're the same person...except I ran out the front door and he ran out the back door\\". Increasingly Capote loses his objectivity and also risks alienating his friends as he is drawn increasingly into the orbit of the sensitive, intelligent Perry. Riveting with powerful performances intelligently written (by actor/writer Dan Futterman) and directed (by Bennett Miller) \\"Capote\\" won't be everyone's cup of tea but it's a complex portrait of one of America's major writers at a turning point in his career.<br /><br />An extremely nice transfer from Sony, \\"Capote\\" has stunning detail and perfectly captures the colors of the film. I was really surprised though at the dirt and specks evident in this transfer. It's something I might have expected from a film 10 years old but nothing as recent or new as this film. It's most noticeable in the shots of the flat farm land of Kansas where the horizon seems to stretch forever. The 5.1 mix makes minimal use of the format the music and dialogue dominating the film. Still there is some nice use of the surround channels for sound effects and background noise.<br /><br />The two most prominent and important special features are the two commentary tracks. The first features director Miller and actor Hoffman. It's a fairly low key affair with the duo focusing on the shooting of the film and performances.  Hoffman doesn't dwell too much on the technical aspects of his performance preferring to discuss the craft of acting of his co-stars. Miller does the honors again with director of photography Adam Kimmel. Miller and Kimmel focus on the visual aspect of the story and how it compliments both the performances and the story as well as providing interesting behind-the-scenes information.<br /><br />\\"Truman Capote: Answered Prayers\\" uses interviews with Miller, Hoffman and Capote biographer Gerald Clarke (who wrote the book the film is based on) to portray the complex individual at the center of the story. It's an interesting thumb nail sketch of a complex, talented individual who peaked very early in his career. We also get a short documentary divided into two parts on the making of the film. \\"Making Capote: Concept to Screen\\" focuses on the pre-production of the film and the development of the screenplay. \\"Making Capote: Defining a Style\\" the second half of the documentary focuses on the look of the film. We also get the usual assortment of Sony previews but, strangely, not the original theatrical trailer for \\"Capote\\".<br /><br />\\"Capote\\" is a fascinating character study about a complex, conflicted man who began an investigation of the brutal murders of a farm family and ended up becoming part of the story as he searched for the story. The film looks extremely good despite some minor analog defects and has some solid but basic extras includingtwo strong commentary tracks. \\"Capote\\" provides us with the drama in both the author's life during a key time in his development as an artist and also how he slid down the slippery slope moving from observer to one of the observed participants related to the horrible murders of an innocent family.including two strong commentary tracks. \\"Capote\\" provides us with the drama in both the author's life during a key time in his development as an artist and also how he slid down the slippery slope moving from observer to one of the observed participants related to the horrible murders of an innocent family.  <br />
B000E5N62U|3.0|I was glad to see Donald Fagen back with a new CD, especially so soon after the wonderful \\"Everything Must Go\\" from Steely Dan.. <br /> <br />After hearing the first couple songs on \\"Morph\\", I became disappointed..The first 4 tracks are excellent, Morph the Cat\\", \\"H Gang\\" \\"Brite Nightgown\\",and \\"What I Do\\" are wonderfully delicious, but the CD seems to go downhill from there...  <br /> <br />After these gems, the rest of the songs sounds the same and listener begins to lose interest.......Not one of his best efforts and certainly not as good as \\"The Nightfly\\", but the new CD is worth getting just the first 4 songs alone!

0887306667|5.0|As a self-taught marketing professoinal in a small market, I found its advice invaluable, and I would attribute a good portion of my current success to the clearly-written examples and logically organized structure of the book's core ideas. While I do agree with some of the aforementioned flaws, I would hesitate to call the book's laws truly redundant or really out-of-date, as it seemed every word applied to my own company situation(s) and experience(s).
0679736646|3.0|I thought Ubik was an imaginative, creative exploration in sci-fi that is thought-provoking, entertaining and depressing at the same time.  however, i did not \\"love\\" the book.  someone else said it felt like Dick changed his mind a few times and never went back to pull it together -- i'd have to agree with this.  i would've liked a little more character development and cohesiveness in the story line.
0393327345|5.0|After watching Fight Club 87 times, read the book. Hard to believe that the movie tanked, but it wasnt because it was bad it was because we the public had no idea how great it was.

B000E41MS6|5.0|If you watch the series on the SciFi channel or read the other reviews, you can determine for yourself whether or not you'll like the new Doctor Who series. My review here will therefore deal more with the DVD set itself. <br />The box set is attractively packaged. The picture of the Doctor and Rose is on a clear plastic sleeve, and the box iteslf can be opened  into a TARDIS model (OK, not really, but it does have 4 panels). There are 5 discs, the first 4 are 3-4 episodes per disc, with commentary and short featurettes dealing with the special effects. The fifth disc includes 9 \\"cut down\\" episodes of Doctor Who Confidential, which aired on BBC3 after the Doctor Who episodes premiered on BBC1. DWC is about what it sounds like, with plenty of behind-the-scenes interviews and \\"How did they do that?\\" segments. Each one is pared down to ~15 minutes. Mine also came with two flyer ads for Doctor Who books, a comment card (oddly enough, targeted to USA customers, despite buying the DVD set from Canada), and a 16-page booklet with plot outlines, credits, and pictures. All the episodes are in widescreen format and 5.1 surround sound. The quality is as good as if it were a movie. <br />I should give my opinion of the show itself. I always liked Doctor Who for its humor, and brilliant storylines. What I didn't like were the sub-par special effects. I believe this series fixes what little was wrong with the original series while keeping what made it great. They clearly have a much greater SFX budget this time around. If you've read this far, you're probably going to buy it anyway. If you really can't wait until July (as I obviously couldn't), you can get it from amazon.ca but it'll cost more for the international shipping.
B000068OCS|5.0|\\"Koyaanisqatsi: life out of balance; crazy life; life in turmoil; life disintegrating; a state of life that calls for another way of living.\\" - Hopi term.<br /><br />A God's eye view of planet earth and its inhabitants. From the opening scene of tribal heiroglyphs and chanting reverberation, the film launches into an enchanting series of impressive environmental scenes set to haunting electronic and instrumental music,  with scenes I have divided into five sections:<br /><br />1. Homage to The Four-Crown Princes of Hell.<br /><br />Stunning vistas of the elements in flux, from canyons to plains to forests to volcanos to fields of kaleidoscopic color, to clouds and storms and the massive movements of the ocean.<br /><br />2. Infernal Machines.<br /><br />Cut to behemoth land-tilling machines, man-made industrial environments, expansive scenery of automobiles, planes, and space-age technological inventions.<br /><br />3. The Herd.<br /><br />The teaming masses shuffling to and fro, set to insect-like speeds. The proles kept in perspective. Crowds and clusters of humanity, with a few individual shots of amusing foibles and locations.<br /><br />4. The Concrete Jungle.<br /><br />Skyscrapers, slums, implosions, construction and destruction, as well as beautiful shots of the metropolitan evening.<br /><br />5. End.<br /><br />A return to the heiroglyphs, which seems to signify a primal contemplation, a return to The Source.<br /><br />Koyaanisqatsi is certainly a Satanic meditation, which would prove beneficial after any interaction with the herd, a veritable \\"eye in the sky\\" - asserts the \\"larger picture\\", as it were. A LaVeyan recommendation, I imagine this would be much more enhanced on a big screen; it is mostly comprised of time-lapse film, adding a certain eerie element, and the tenebrous music compliments it well.
B00005NP04|5.0|This is the first album by Martina I ever bought, and the whole thing is so good!  (Of course it should be, being a Greatest Hits album!)  This is one of those albums I can't get enough of, it's so good and fun to sing along with!
B00004T1C8|4.0|My son really likes this train tunnel.  And the sounds are not too loud and annoying for Mom and Dad! ;-)  The \\"Thomas\\" tunnel has track going over the top the other way which would have been a nice thing on this one but it is very nice.  They show \\"kids\\" playing on the mountain on the box but they don't include any with it!  They should have at least thrown in one.
B000E41MS6|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I first heard the show was coming back-a feeling familiar to many fans. After 16 years of false starts and rumors the show was finally coming back. Would it be any good? Who is Russell T Davies or Christopher Eccleston? These and many other questions must have run through many fan's minds as they did through mine. <br /> <br />I began to have a good feeling when I read some interviews and Russell T's column in Doctor Who Magazine. I felt that the show was in good hands and eagerly awaited my first glimpse of the show. Sure I was disapoointed when the show wasn't picked up in the US but thanks to the internet I was able to see all the episodes as well as the Confidential documentaries. <br /> <br />All I can say is it was worth the wait. Eccleston made an intense, forceful Doctor and Billie Piper was a revelation as Rose Tyler. Both of them and the show itself were deserving of the awards and praise they received. <br /> <br />I'm enjoying seeing the episodes on the Sci-Fi channel and will be there in early July to buy this set. Now bring on David Tennant.
B0009A40ES|1.0|Trust me ~ If you're a Yaoi Fan there is only one scene in this damn disgusting movie you'll like. And that's when the dude is running down the stairs in the nude, otherwise it's all just him screwing all the chicks he can at the same time. I couldn't see a plot, it only relied on porn. Disgusting movie. If there was anything lower then 1 star I'd give it to this stupid movie.
B00005JO9J|5.0|this DVD set was in perfect condition and came in a timely manner
0875428940|5.0|I like very much the interpretation and the drawing style of this deck. Clear and direct each card gives a strong felling for good insights. <br />I think it could become a new classic deck. Don't miss it! <br /> <br />Blessings <br />:) <br />CofS
B0000TB050|5.0|I love this DVD. If you are a fan or not, you should check this out. I mean the emotions and the playfulness from the band was great. The setlist is awesome too. I can watch this over and over again! I think this one is better than the Boston DVD.
0201485672|5.0|No kidding, this book completely changed the way I code and think about coding. OK, I'm not one of your A-list, published OO authorities, but I've been coding for a long time, and this changed everything. <br /> <br />It's called \\"Refactoring\\", but along the way you see that it explicates an entire philosophy of OO design. The whole thing is presented so engagingly and with an appealing tongue-in-cheek sly wittiness that you almost read it like a novel or memoir. And what is presented is profound, fascinating and totally practical. You can apply it today. <br /> <br />(I came here to plug the book, which I had just reopened for the thousandth time, and just decided I also ought to let y'all know that I was inspired by this to write a refactoring tool for VB6, CodeShine).
B000BEZQ18|5.0|The haunting score is beautifully intact, interspersed with country-western songs as if you get the \\"optimistic\\" pop-culture \\"take\\" on the west, followed by the \\"Brokeback\\" score.  The addition of Rufus Wainwright's \\"The Maker Makes\\" is heartbreakingly in tune with the mood of the film, especially at its emotionally powerful climax.  Wonderful to listen to and re-play.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|An amazing film of an amazingly written story. The adaptation of the story to a screenplay was genius, and the film was as beautiful as it was depressing. You have to be a pretty hard hearted individual not to be touched and angered at the story presented here. We all get only one life, and who we choose to love is our own business and no one elses, no matter how much they wish it to be.

B00005JOE8|5.0|V For Vendetta is a rare sort of film.  It does qualify as an action movie, but at its core are some real-world issues that are sort of timeless.  Natalie Portman stars as Evey Hammond, a girl with an interesting past whose life is saved by a masked stranger named V (Hugo Weaving).  V is a lterate, mysterious anti-hero who enjoys alliterating, but does not think twice about doing what he deems necessary.  Some would say he is a terrorist, which is sort of true.  But like all terrorists he believes in his cause, and will risk anything to see it through.  V takes Evey in, and begins his plan to collapse the dictatorial government if a future London, lorded over by Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt).  The events that follow are very dramatic, and as we learn the stories of V, Evey, and others, there seems to be a connection in how certain events changed their lives.   <br /> <br />Directed by James McTeigue, his first effort as such, V is an impressive film.  The pacing works well, buidling to an effective conclusion.  The film is not perfect - what movie is? - but it's easily the best film I have seen this year.  Don't be deceived - this is a drama with action, much more so than the matrix films, to which V has drawn many comparisons.  If you are able, catch it in IMAX to punch up the action scenes(not that they need it!). <br /> <br />A final note - this movie has been accused of attacking the bush administration and the war in Iraq.  Please understand that this is based on a comic book story written in 1982 railing against Margaret Thatcher's London of that time, and is only one perspective that can be applied to most government structures.  Don't take it too seriously!  Final grade: A+
0684824906|4.0|I thought the book was a comfortable read for being so detailed in the lives of the rivals.  I learned more of the details of the attempted assignation of Seward, who was forward thinking enough to purchase Alaska.  I have a book of some of the speeches given by Lincoln which I could refer to when they were suggested in the \\"Team of Rivals\\".  This in gave me a broader view of Lincoln's thinking and enhanced the book.  In the book of speeches of Lincoln's is a speech on the Missouri Compromise and Lincoln's clear statement on the history of the compromise helped showed Lincoln's thought process.  The \\"Team of Rivals\\" helps everyone to see the true character of Lincoln.  It is worth a re-read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a great show to say the least, and brought down by a studios decision, to bad. I enjoyed this DVD Collection and would recommend it to anyone interested in the Sci-Fi category. It's a cool story and the Fire Fly ship does remind me of that famous Star Wars ship. Not by the design but by the same thing that Solo had with his ship. Love! Anyway, Buy it!!!!!!!!!And go buy a brown trench coat!!!!!!!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Not only are the songs tried and true, but Michael Buble can put you into the most mellow mood after a rough day...I think he was singing to me!
B000069AUI|5.0|I read an interview once that stated that Chris Martin wrote \\"Warning Sign\\" when he was in a ridiculous mood and that the song was a trifle and had no real meaning. You could have bowled me over with a feather. Mmmm. Be that as it may, and I must admit the revelation flattened me a bit, I deem this particular work as music 'par excellence' and have added it to my #1 song list. Admittantly, the whole album is brilliant...it's melodic, it moves the soul; and even if you do question what drugs Martin was taking when he wrote some of those often critised so-called meaningless lyrics, in the end it doesn't really matter. The lyrics and the music are as one and form to make one beautiful whole. I really can't critise one song here, well maybe \\"Green Eyes\\" because it's just a tad too folky for me, but I still like it. This album would have to be may all-time favourite...to me it outshines Neil Young's \\"Harvest\\" of the 70s, The Cure's \\"KissMeKissMeKissMe\\" of the 80s and Supergrass's \\"In it for the Money\\" of the 90s. If you havent listened to this album yet, do yourself a favour and get into it. You might want to listen to \\"X & Y\\" after that and that certainly wouldn't be a waste of time either. <br />
B000002AP1|2.0|I bought this when it first came out in 72, and I pity 14 year old kids today who don't have a record like this \\"to do all the things that kids aren't supposed to do\\" to (if that makes any sense).  If my old vinyl copy could talk, I'd be in jail for the rest of my life.  That is, if I could find the damn thing.  And that's a BIG deal, because the remastering of this album completely ruins one of the wildest listening experiences ever created.  On the original album, every tune sounded like it was recorded in different venue with a different producer.  Every mix was completely different, and by objective standards, unbelievably horrible.  By subjective standards, however, the uniquely ridiculous sound of each track made for one of the ten best rock and roll albums ever. \\"Search and Destroy\\" was all trebled-out, overdriven Stratocasters and virtually no bass, with an up-front metallic clanking throughout that really hurt the ears, even at low volumes (listen to any track on the Mary Chain's Psychocandy to hear roughly what it used to sound like).  Raw Power growled away muddily, with lots more low-end sludge than on this version.  Death Trip sounded just like the name implies, with the lead guitar sounding like it was recorded with the mike about an inch away from the amp, and turned up to 11 with an outrageous treble boost.  Shake Appeal (which fares best on this CD) sounded like it was recorded in muddy mono, until the up-riff ended, and then the power chords exploded in a huge wall of stereo sound, and then shrank back to mono (the effect was mind-boggling at high volume).  But the crown-jewel, the piece-de-resistance, was \\"Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell.\\"  If ever a dirtier, sludgier fast rocker was ever recorded (with Iggy's absurd growling-screeching buried behind the wall of unbelievably distorted guitars and bass)I've never heard it.  Just thinking about the way it used to sound after a micro-dot is putting a big smile on my face.  But it doesn't sound anything like that on this remaster, nor does any other track sound remotely as good as on the original (with the possible exception of Shake Appeal, which I preferred in the old mix but which has a lot of power in the new version). And unless you've ever heard the original release, you can't possibly imagine the roll that the right mix can play in turning an excellent album into something that changes your life (not always for the \\"better\\" in this case). I've been collecting records and CD's compulsively for over 30 years, much to the detriment of floor-space in my domicile, and I've never seen a re-mastering ruin an album the way Raw Power has been eviscerated.  The re-mastering is really loud, but that's not the point.  I've got a volume control to deal with the relatively low levels of the old masters.  For the love of all that's Holy, somebody get ahold of the original masters that were used on the old albums and re-release this thing.  Then, kiddies, you're in for some real fun.hing like that on this remaster, nor does any other track sound remotely as good as on the original (with the possible exception of Shake Appeal, which I preferred in the old mix but which has a lot of power in the new version).

B0001WTVUW|1.0|I got this because I read an online article that spun this as a cool movie about how society falls apart after a nuclear attack.  I was looking for sort of a Red Dawn vibe - how people survive a catastrophe.  I couldn't even get through the first hour of the movie.  Totaly saucy 80's TV movie.  Totally.
B000CBSHK2|2.0|Enormous potential.  A history of excellence.  But something went terribly wrong in the execution.  Maybe it's not as bad as the subject line would suggest but it's a huge disappointment nonetheless.  Even has \\"Worms\\" as Jar-Jar.  With the exception of the occasionally harmonica bit, the band just isn't terribly interesting.  And a lot of the melodic aspects and tonal richness of Beth's singing are gone -- sometimes she just sounds like a squaking crow.<br /><br />I started listening to Beth after hearing her guest performances with the Chemical Brothers & really enjoyed her voice in that context, but with a conventional band (and production that ofter underemphasizes the vocals in favor of humdrum backup) it's just not that interesting.  I've tried, really, playing this over and over, but it still disappoints.

Each of the family members owned a car, and each occupant had the exclusive use of a tv. I wonder if they communicated by email and SMS?  Would this family be called dysfunctional? Or lucky?<br /><br />It may be incorrect to call this splendid novel a \\"disquisition\\" but it certainly addresses the issue of the reproduction of our species - specifically, that of the Western Society middle classes.  Its point of view is a woman of such a society and the first big question addressed is Why Have a Baby?  The discussion around this is thorough and revealing and covers a lot of bases - including the one where the female gets pregnant surreptitiously (a second child) which is to say by her husband but on his mistaken belief that she had taken precautions.  This raises the issue of mans' responsibility for contraception. Nevertheless, I haven't read a work that covers the issue of pregnancy so well and so thoroughly and I must say I am completely in sympathy with the character Eva. This is only ONE of the many issues that Eva ponders in her searching for the origins, making and fate of her son.<br /><br />Her sense of alienation from her body, her husband, her son, America (see P 197 - In a country that doesn't discriminate between fame and infamy, the latter presents itself as plainly more achievable\\" is paralleled by her ruthless analysis of the logic of the myths of motherhood - viz, to claim to love children is as foolish as to say one loves people some of whom include Pol Pot p. 213. At one point her son seems to take on the essence of what it means to be a stereotypical American and she lambasts that stereotype annd argues that in essence Americans are stupid. (p.327) Then Kevin analyses her elitist argument and cuts it to shreds (p. 328).<br /><br />These are just of the issues raised in this novel.

B00005JO9J|5.0|I didn't want to like this show but I'm so hooked.  I started watching a few shows into the season so I just had to get this DVD.  If you're a casual watcher, this will get you up to date
B000E6UK5K|4.0|being a PF and Dave fan i bought ON AN ISLAND the day it was released.  upon first listen i didnt think it was very good, but its certainly grown on me.   lets face it, you buy a david gilmour recording to hear his always tasty solos.  this recording is very mellow, but contains some guitar jams that are off the charts.   \\"take a breath\\" is a burner, too me the most floydish song on the cd.   the title track is very mellow but again, you get that singing guitar solo that your craving.  \\"smile\\" belongs in the junk pile.   i really cant believe Dave recorded that, i think Polly Samson is corrupting him lol.   if you like Daves guitar work then buy the album, you will enjoy it.  its not as good as his 2 other solo recordings though.  <br /> <br /> now heres my 2cents on the dave/pink floyd vrs roger waters.     these guys dont realise it, but they need each other to make the best music.   Waters solo stuff has been mostly crap and Daves solo stuff, while good, is lacking behind what PF was at its best.   Dave is a great guitarist and singer, but not a songwriter.    together they made the most awesome music to ever be recorded.    now Waters is ready to reform the band and Dave is saying he has no interest.   i sure wish he would reconsider, but i cant say as i blame him. it WAS Waters who quit the band and assumed that it shouldnt and couldnt go on without him, he even fought for the PF name in court, and now he wants to rejoin the band. still, i WANT SOME MORE PINK FLOYD damn it.

0201721481|4.0|I've been programming in C for 25 years.  In the last 15 years, I've read a number of C++ books (I even read the first half of Stroustrup's 3rd edition.  This was the first treatment I've read which I really absorbed (part of the fact is I had to learn c++).<br /><br />While the treatment is thorough, I found far too many typos in a 4th edition.  I really abhor typos in a technical book where the characters in an example MUST be right for it to work.<br /><br />Barbara Moo gave me a copy of the errata (I submitted a number of errors I found).  But one of the MAJOR shortcomings is why do I have to look up the author's to get an errata?  Shouldn't the errata be on Addison's web site? (I just looked -- its not there -- I sent them a message).  Also, be able to find the answers would be valuable (For a reader, examples without answers don't<br />necessarily help much).<br /><br />I don't think its an introductory programming book.  I just looked up the word \\"primer\\" -- this book goes far beyond what a<br />\\"primer\\" would contain.  It covers C++ in depth.  A number of subjects are covered in a way so a range of solutions ot problems<br />are presented from bad to good to introduce new features.<br /><br />One thing I missed was full examples of working programs, being dissected.  There are a lot of snippets. not whole programs.  I find larger examples would be a good teaching tool.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very positive review -- the best,  most thorough treatment I've read -- with some caveats.
B00003CXAW|4.0|I am not huge fan of classic era movies. Born a few decades to late I guess. However this is one of my favorites, it is truly timeless. After 73 years its amazing how the story holds up, more so how the special effects hold up. Granted they hardly compare to the CGI wonders we have today, but this movie was so ahead of its time it amazing. Any how I think this version is great for the whole family, I have a 7 year old and had no problem letting him watch this. Can't say the same for the new version. Dont get me wrong I loved the new version, but its bit much for younger kids.
B000B8QF14|5.0|Reviews for this concert video seem to fit one of three categories:<br /><br />You hate Green Day and everything they do (so why are you here?).<br /><br />You love Green Day and think they can do no wrong.<br /><br />You're a huge fan, saw them live four times in the last two years, and are disappointed that watching this video doesn't match the experience.<br /><br />I was in this last group when I first got it (though I'd only seen them once live). But sitting in your living room watching TV will NEVER match the chaos that is GD's live show, no matter how loud you play it. And now that I've had this for several months, I'm surprised at how often I play it even now. When life gets boring or crappy, just lay on the floor and crank up the sound -- it takes you right back to the crazy excitement of that concert if you've seen them, or creates its own excitement if you haven't. Green Day are exceptional showmen and this has them on top of their game. These concerts obviously meant a lot to them, and it's nice to hear them talk about it during the interview clips. (No jaded rockstar bull***t). Just because American Idiot addresses serious subjects, doesn't mean Green Day doesn't still know how to have fun. And with Bullet in a Bible, they do their past to pass that fun along to their fans. Thanks, guys.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Ok there are movies that get bad reviews that I just dont get, this is one of the movies. This is a great action/adventure movie. I had my doubts about Jack Black, but he really does deliver as does the rest of the cast. Kong was a lot fun. Before being turned off by sitting thru a 3 hour long movie, set aside a night make some pop corn and just sit back and watch it. The 3 hours will fly by and you will be amazed.
B000E8QVWY|1.0|This pale vanity project takes the life of Johnny Cash and his wives and lays a coat of Hollywood white wash so thick you'll find yourself struggling to breath. When you notice family member (in this case John the son of Cash and June as executive producer in the credits) that should be warning enough. What you will not be prepared for is one of the worst scripts in recent memory that made it into a major motion picture. Walk the Line just dabbles with Cash's life long battle with drug and alcohol abuse spending its and our energy on a sugar coated (the sugar being Reese Witherspoon's saccharine performance) industry standard bio picture. A lot has been made of the performances of the leads and of the two Phoenix's keeps the film watchable. Also the fact that the performers sing with their own voices was highly touted at Oscar nomination time.  Well I thought actors are trained in voice and body to take on these types of challenges, so what's the big deal?  \\"Walk the Line\\" is a run of the \\"Hollywood\\" mill romance movie disguised as an honest look at a great musical figure and the role his talented wife and their lives and struggles.

When the plane lands safely, she returns to work only to discover that her seatmate is the president of her company!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have been thinking about submitting a review for this series for quite some time, but could not come up with sufficient words to describe how much my wife and I love it. <br /> <br />\\"Firefly\\" embodies everything that a good TV series or movie should be - excellent acting, great writing, wonderful sets, and character profiles with which you can easily identify. All of these are present in this series, especially the complex characters. They all have feelings, they are all motivated by something, and they all look out for each other like family. <br /> <br />The sense of adventure is also very present in each episode. The crew of the Firefly is flying across the 'Verse to make money on jobs, have fun, explore planets, and live free. It is what all of us were born to do (minus the crime of course). There are many homages to other sci-fi films and series, but the show also has many original concepts as well. <br /> <br />Buy this DVD package as soon as you can - you will find you are watching these episodes over and over, with both family members and friends. They are that good... The appeal is there for all age groups and tastes, save small children. And you will be humming the theme song every day, singing the words, and thinking about quitting your job to go roam the countryside in search of adventure. <br /> <br />There are strong reasons why this series was released years ago and still has a huge fanbase, and you will be added as soon as you watch the first episode.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Gladiator will always be an excellent movie due to the terrific performances and stunning locations.  Ridley Scott did a great job in getting this movie to where it is now in motion picture history, and sadly missed out on a Best Director Oscar, which was an injustice in my opinion.  This 3 disc set has an Extended Edition by 17 or so minutes.  I was a little dissapointed that the little bit with the lions attacking the people wasn't put back in.  I remembered that from the old DVD.  Disc 2 has a great documentary about the making of the film that's pretty substantial, covering aevery aspect of production.  The segment about the \\"resurrection\\" of Oliver Reed is especially interesting.  The special effects team had to re-do several shots of Oliver Reed and adjust the lighting and colors to make it seem like he was in a different place.  They also had a few shots where his face was placed over a double's body.  I'd say they did a pretty good job.  Disc 3 has some deleted scenes and an alternate opening credits which are interesting, some stills and some trailers.  This is worth the purchase for the Gladiator/Ridley Scott/Good Movie fan.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This is the third DCFC album I've owned and they keep getting better.  The songwriting, arrangements and lyrical imagry is lush and beautiful.

B00008YLV2|5.0|This is my favorite war movie of all time.  Ridley Scott has done an excellent job telling the story of the Mogadishu battle in 1993.  Yes, some of the events have been changed and characters combined from the book, but the movie is so good that none of it matters.  This war movie tells the story of what happens, it doesn't delve into thoughts of people or their odd poetic fantasies (Thin Red Line) and it doesn't go into slow motion to show one person sitting in the middle of a warzone watching his comrades die in horror (Saving Private Ryan).  This movie is a real time account of the battle and shows what happens.  It's a non-stop battle in the middle of a city.  The action never lets up one moment thoughout the whole movie, so it might be too much for some, but it's excellent.  This 3 disc set is awsome.  The production documentaries about the making of the film really show you the dedication by the actors and the hardships of filming in certain locations.  Disc 3 has 2 documentaries about the true story of the fight that shed light on some of the events that are changed around.  Everyone should see this movie and this DVD is probably one of the best produced ever.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|C'mon you guys.  This album is full of heart and soul.  Don't knock it unless you can do it too.  If I can write, record and produce a record a fraction as good as this one when I am 60, I'll be over the moon.  Polly wrote lyrics that mattered to David and their family.  If you can't see that, you're not looking.  If you wanted something else, why is it always about you? <br /> <br />The guitar playing on this album is as wonderful as ever, the arrangements are lavish and lush and I love it.  I have to give a full ten marks out of ten for resisting the temptation to trade off past glories and for taking the risks and doing the hard work to produce new art.  How many artists that were this big do you know that are still trying to find something new to say, still trying to perfect their musical voice and still trying to do something fresh and relevant, several decades after we first heard them? <br /> <br />If you love atmospheric, thoughtful, soulful, meaningful, soothing, immersive music, buy this CD and hear how it is done by the master.
0439679958|5.0|It a good book if you like the mystery type.  It's hard to know exactly what happens next. So it keeps you reading till the end with anxiety to find out what happens next. Of course story plots like this one are common but no other will keep you as entertained as this one.

He's working the fantasy genre absolutely to its fullest, creating some truly outstanding literature. I was very excited to get to Stardust, especially when I read that it has been compared to The Princess Bride, which is one of my favorite novels. Needless to say, Gaiman again didn't disappoint.<br /><br />As with some of Gaimen's other works, when you first hear the plot, you think that he's just rehashing old fantasy/adventure plots, characters, and ideas. Then, of course, you read the book, and you find that he's surprisingly original. Stardust is sort of like that. The protagonist is Tristan Thorne, who is the young loser in a Victorian village that hosts a magical fair every nine years. Pursuing romance and adventure, Tristan promises the beautiful Victoria that he will bring back to her the star that he and Victoria had seen fall from the sky, and upon presenting to her the star, he will marry Victoria. Of course, nothing works out as planned. The journey has plenty of challenges, and the star is not quite what was expected.<br /><br />The whole novel was really a joy to read. It sounds like your standard fairy-tale romance, but Gaiman does so much with it. There's plenty of exciting and satisfying plot twists, plenty of humor, and the characters' stories are all compelling. I'll be reading this novel again, and I'll definitely recommend it to all of my friends. It's hard to find books that are just this much fun.

B000000993|5.0|Can it be 13 years ago this came out?  A phone call to a friend in dispair about the lack of any decent music, his one word answer, \\"TOOL\\".  No album has ever had the personal impact for me that Undertow did.  The first time I heard it, I literally got chills in the middle of each song as I realized how incredibly good it was. <br /> <br />Listening to Undertow is like having your brain smashed in by a piece of obsidian that's been dipped in liquid crystal meth.  Such perfect beautiful rage. <br /> <br />Best heavy metal album of my lifetime.

0515123447|4.0|I picked this book up at a discount bookstore, on the recommendation of the man that worked there.  I need to go back and thank him.  This is a book, not perfect, but well written.<br /><br />  I don't want to give any of the plot away and ruin it for you, but the basic story revolves around a vetern who is drifting through the U.S. after spending a good many years in the governments service.  He gets off a bus and enters a small town only to be arrested for murder.  If he has any hope of getting out of this unscathed, he is going to have to do his own investigating to ferret out why he was set up and who is behind it all.  To make matters worse, he knows one of the murder victims.  A coincidence?  Maybe.  A set up? Possibly.  Are heads gonna roll?  You bet!  The story takes off from there and I can't tell you anything else without giving the plot away.<br /><br />  The characters were well thought out and for the most part, they work well together.  There are plot twists for everyone and the story, generally, is believable.  There are a couple of awkward moments when the story gets carried away and silly.  Overall, this is a fun read.

That being said, I enjoyed watching this movie.  I found myself getting misty at parts and laughing at others.  It isn't the A&E version, but it is very enjoyable.
0385338686|3.0|This book is not meant to be a work of literature. It is a soap opera, with all the right ingredients. First the hilariously cliched characters: the workaholic lawyer, the nouvoux riche employers, the stud of a gardener. The sheer absurdity of the plot - a lawyer mistaken as a housekeeper, not even knowing how to turn on the stove! And on it goes. It's like Gosford Park meets the Bold and the Beautiful. I bought this book as airport reading and that's exactly what it is. Light and funny. I read it in a day and loved it for what it is.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|Many rock fans will cite \\"Raw Power\\" or even the eponymous first Stooges record as their best, but this one has always been my favorite. This is music that cannot be heard loud enough, always moves me, and sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday. Though I was but a tyke when it first came out, I know what it was like to grow up in Vietnam era south-east Michigan...damn, this sh*t hits a real nerve. This is authentic urban blues music. Glad to be alive, but slogging through a world of dirt...\\"I been HURT!\\" The bonus tracks on this release are greatly welcomed. Easily one of the 25 best rock albums ever made.

B000E97HIA|5.0|Truly an artist in ever sense of the word. Michael who?
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica expands their sound and breaks out of their thrash roots in a big way on \\"Master of Puppets\\". Certainly MOP is still a thrash album at heart, but far more progressive than anything else Metallica had done up to this point. The late, great Cliff Burton's fingerprints are all over this album - that, combined with better production and a more mature sounding band all around makes one helluva package. <br /> <br />\\"Battery\\" starts out innocently enough with a nice acoustic intro until Metallica lowers the boom with a crushing riff. This opener is played at breakneck speed. The song is an adrenaline rush about rage, aggression, and all that other good stuff. Pretty much a perfect soundtrack for beating the hell out of somebody, it's pure power. <br /> <br />The second track, \\"Master of Puppets\\" has a lot going for it - meaningful lyrics about drug addiction, killer riffs, and a beautiful softer bridge section in the middle. Metallica have always had some serious chops and they really show them off on this song. <br /> <br />\\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" is probably the weakest song on the album, quite slow and bludgeoning. Metallica continues their H.P. Lovecraft lovefest that started with \\"The Call of the Ktulu\\" on Ride The Lightning. This song is really really freakin heavy and creates a sense of all hell breaking loose. Still pretty damn good, although this song is more straightfoward metal and not as technically impressive as the other songs - exactly why it's the weakest. <br /> <br />\\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" is another masterpiece. James Hetfield's voice is great on this song and really makes the beginning part haunting. As it progresses, Metallica's guitars really crunch on this song, and it builds into one of their best ever. <br /> <br />\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is a favorite of mine, it's pure thrash with huge riffs and anti-war lyrics that point out how soldiers are an expendable resource to the government. The middle section kicks all sorts of ass, containing some of the best riffs and solos the band has ever done. And the chorus? I have nothing more to say than \\"Back to the front\\" - just great stuff all around. <br /> <br />\\"Leper Messiah\\" is another one of the weaker tracks on the album, with the same plodding and yet really heavy feel of \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\". Still pretty good, just feels bland, especially sandwiched between \\"Disposable Heroes\\" and the brilliant... <br /> <br />\\"Orion\\" is an incredible instrumental. Cliff's influence is all over this atmospheric and spacey song. Well, it's about as atmospheric and spacey as Metallica gets, beginning with the customary crunching riffs, and then slowing down into the section for which the song is named. The slow, melodic section of this song is gold, it's majestic and manages to capture the feel of outer space. The harmonics are awesome, and this section ends with one of Hammett's finest solos, then back to the heavy stuff once more. A metal epic! <br /> <br />\\"Damage Inc.\\" closes out MOP by going back to pure aggressive thrash. What's the meaning of this song? Who cares? As heavy as the album is, this one hits like a ton of bricks and piles on even more.  <br /> <br />Then it ends, and if you are a fan of metal, you will most likely be satisfied.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Why did they cancel it?\\" I really wish I had an answer for the question everyone seems to come to after being talked into watching Firefly for the first time.  Its an hilarious look at the types of people the Enterprise shot past in the first few minutes of one episode, without aliens or much technology beyond the ship its set in this show manages to be ten times as origional as anything on t.v. and I can only hope that one day FOX will stop pushing anything interesting off the air in favor of the same old stereotypical crap.  If your after a truly amazing series one of the only ones with enough re-watch value to own and definitely a solid purchase this is it.  And thanks to all the Brown Coats out there who got Serenity made, we loved it so it stayed in the air.
0553293397|4.0|A policeman from Earth, where the population all lives underground in close quarters, is called in to investigate a murder on a distant world. This world is populated by very few humans, rarely if ever, coming into physical proximity of each other. Instead the people \\"View\\" each other with holographic images. The mystery is, \\"How does a murder occur in a world where people can't stand to be in the presence of one another and robots can do no harm?\\" (Remember this is an Asimov book with his rules for robots firmly in place.) Asimov's variation on the \\"locked door\\" mystery is intriguing and adds in a sociological element that creates an interesting interpretation of what the future may hold in the relationship between man and machine is not carefully balanced. While the dated references that all older SF novels suffer from are to be found throughout the novel, this one does work as a good mystery. Even as the killer is exposed, you will be gratified to know that Asimov does not leave any loose threads by the time the book is finished.
B000002UR7|5.0|Back in 1993, it wasn't easy to hear much around besides grunge. Yet, Radiohead's \\"Creep\\" managed to make it in between Nirvana's, Pearl Jam's and Green Day's hits to catch the ear of many who -like me- continue to be devoted fans of their work to this day.<br /><br />From the opening guitar line of \\"You\\" it is hard not to get caught by the magic of their musical phrasing. This is all pre-Oasis, pre-Travis. This is indie prog rock in the making, with these guys fabricating a new electric sound in songs like \\"How Do You?\\" and balancing it off in others like \\"Thinking About You\\" where the acoustic guitar can be just as powerful. Then, combining the two in \\"Ripcord\\" and making you feel like rock music first started to be played like this.<br /><br />\\"Pablo Honey\\" is not Radiohead's best work (that honor would probably belong to \\"OK Computer\\"). Yet it's an extraordinary production and an even more amazing debut. Many bands since and before them would want to have their best album ever be half as solid as Radiohead's first one.<br /><br />Own it.<br /><br />UPDATE (06/03/08): Thanks for the clarification about \\"pre-James\\". Indeed James were making music before Radiohead.
B000003TAW|3.0|WEEZER is a triumph of lyrical sophistication trapped in acceptable but less than memorable music.  There is a general familiarity in many of the songs, each containing a simple melody that support the insightful and exceptional lyrics adequately, but don't do them complete justice. When the music does live up to the lyric, like on \\"Undone,\\" \\"Buddy Holly,\\" and \\"In the Garage\\" the results are captivating and memorable. This is a CD where the focus is on what is being said and how it is sung, the music is a bit player and that does not make for the most satisfying listen. These variations on teen angst, with their outsider feel are truly wonderful; I just don't find the tunes that go with them quite as memorable as the words.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Some people question whether Prince is still 'relevant' to modern music. A pioneer of black funk-rock and R&B, his recent albums have not sold quite as well (a notable exception being Musicology, which was given away at his hugely popular concert tour). 3121 won't silence those critics, and probably won't sell as well as his albums prior to the name-change, but it's a solid outing and far better than most popular music released. <br /> <br />Unlike Musicology, there are no weak tracks in this set. Strengths include experimental tracks (3121, The Dance), pop tunes (Lolita, Love), funk work-outs (Black Sweat), and rock work-outs (Fury). Prince's trademark sensuality is still there (Te Amo Corazon, Incense & Candles), and in fact the balads on this album are his strongest in years. The only possible weakness is its closing (Get On The Boat), which is just another James Brown R&B track, similar to The Work and Musicology. <br /> <br />Is Prince still 'relevant'? If that means heavy radio airplay and millions of records sold, probably not. Can he still make groundbreaking music that will influence other musicians? YES!
0446607274|4.0|An attorney, who has made his career and reputation on suing the LAPD, is murdered and Bosch is called in to deal with the racially sensitive and politically explosive case. Corruption, secrecy, and political expediency are all factors that Bosch must contend with in trying to find the killer, amidst a community and police department that have their own agendas.  Bosch must also deal with his own preconceived notions of what the really occurred at Angels Flight and this is another obstacle that has to be overcome if he is to find the real killer, not just one that will suit the outside forces weighing heavily on this case. This is a gripping example of Bosch having to extricate himself from an extremely tough circumstance; the type of story that Connelly excels at. Only a flawed conclusion, where things don't really play out the way they would in the \\"real\\" world, keep this from being among the best in Bosch novels.

B00005YXZH|2.0|....is beyond me.  Now I like Wilco.  Summerteeth is a great album, basically everything up until this terrible album was very good.  Maybe this album wouldn't be so terrible if the horrible song \\"heavy metal drummer\\", was not on here.  In fact, that song is so terrible it should not have been made.  I am sorry to those who love this album, but I just can't get into it.  There are a few scattered tracks on here that keep me from giving it a worse rating than 2 stars.  Maybe this album would be good if you were used to listening to really crappy music for an exstensive period of time and than discovered that coldplay is a really sad excuse of a band, and you put away your interpol cd's because you finally realized that they are a joy division ripoff but way worse.  Than maybe YHFT would be a good album to you, but Wilco could, and has done alot better than this.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is an amazing film. The actors were tremendous. Despite the small minded bigots who can no longer openly hate Blacks and/or Women, and who now channel their petty hate towards homosexuals, the success of this film speaks for itself in the minds and hearts of Americans and people worldwide. Only an ignorant person would say this film is about gays, because it's not. The film is about love. Pure and simple. And it will remain a noble and triumphant film about love for the rest of time. Thank God!
B00005JOWR|4.0|INHALE     You'll need to inhale, then exhale and relax before plunging into the world of Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), lobbyist and bag man for the Tobacco Industry. The laughs are some of the best abdominal exercise I've ever had at the movies. Thank You for Smoking is far and away the best satire to come out of Hollywood in years. The last attempt I remember was WAG THE DOG. This film is far better at true satire, its wit biting do-gooders and do-badders alike. It has been too long since Satire and the Politically Incorrect Sense of Humor have been allowed to point out the absurd in all sides of an issue. If you don't laugh out loud, your sense of humor has become a casualty of malpractice by the Doctors of Spin and the Nursemaids of Political Correctness.     Young Jason Reitman's direction and screenplay are deft and light. He is never heavy-handed, or worse, condescending (as might have happened once or twice in WAG THE DOG). Based on a novel by Christopher Buckley (the son of William F. Buckley), the script is the star here. The double, triple, and sometimes quadruple entendres are spoken conversationally by a star-studded ensemble cast, who clearly revel in great material and great lines. Every reviewer opines that this will be Aaron Eckhart's break-out role. With his Dudley-Do-Right face and \\"that guy who always gets the girl----- on crack\\" charm and glibness, his Nick Naylor is the ultimate purveyor of the spin doctor's prescription: \\"the means justify the end\\".      The casting director should be congratulated in the same breath as the director. Rob Lowe as the \\"genius\\" behind Hollywood \\"EGO\\", a consultant firm which helps raise financing for movies with strategic product placement, is note-perfect in a \\"small role\\". With William H. Macy, the Vermont Senator who takes on the tobacco industry, Maria Bello, a fellow Merchant of Death lobbyist, and Robert Duvall, the \\"Captain\\" of this particular industry--- the cast is jaw-dropping, and sublimely funny.  Katie Holmes, pre-TomKat, is gorgeous, seductive, and completely believable as the reporter who stops at nothing to get her story.      Nick Naylor's relationship with his son is the lens which focuses Nick on his own behavior. Even that relationship is neither treated as a clich, nor completely reverently by the satirist, who remains true to the last frame to the goal of letting the air out of our self-righteousness. It is a breath of fresh air. I not only recommend it, I intend to see it again.
B000E97HIA|5.0|I agree with most reviewers that this is a better CD than Musicology, but if falls below Gold and Diamonds & Pearls and everything before that.  Still if you rearrange the songs this makes a pretty hot CD.<br /><br />  It's kind of like Michael Jackson's Invincible.  If you rearrange the tracks you find it's a better CD.

B0002OERI0|3.0|Well, after many years of simple punk rock music that Green Day has put out and been very successful with, this album sure is a change.  I don't particularly care for it because it sounds so much different than previous albums.  Now this doesn't mean the album is bad.  The music is still very well written and organized and I don't not like any of the songs.  It is just somewhat of a disappointment to me because Green Day's previous music has been totally awesome ever since their beginning, and now they have almost completely abandoned their punk reputation.  Overall though, not a bad CD, but if you are a Green Day fan from only listening to American Idiot, and have never heard any of their earlier music, I strongly reccommend listening to the first five albums, 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, Kerplunk, Dookie, Insomniac, and Nimrod, if you want to get a true impression of this band.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is my favorite PF album even though I enjoy listening to \\"Wish You Were Here\\" more often and I agree with most critics that \\"Dark Side...\\" is their best record just due to how focused and perfect that whole album is.   <br /> <br />What grabs me about \\"Animals\\" is really how punk rock the lyrics are when you really get down to what they really mean.  Roger is far too intelligent to just come out and name names.  He's always been the best at not making the songs too personal so that you can fit your life experiences into the songs and relate to them easily.  He really takes a shot at all the greedy, slimey yuppies and politicians on this record, IMO, and does it well.   <br /> <br />It's also Floyd at their most stripped down.  The don't muck it up with too many overdubs, but still make it pretty damn full where it needs to be.  I love how it begins and ends sparsely, but Gilmour nails the solos in \\"Dogs\\" and he's one of the few guys who can play a solo and you'll be \\"singing\\" the solo in your head for the rest of your life.   <br /> <br />I'm sure all of the components of the record were due to the way they were blasted by all punk rock kids at the time as well as the lyrical content.  I think the songs needed to be a little more rough and less polished due to the subject matter.  Roger is comparing humans to animals here.  I wish Gilmour had listened to this more before doing his recent solo \\"effort\\", but most of all I'd like to see these guys get back in the studio and make an album.  Waters still has things to say and Gilmour's voice still holds up along with his guitar playing.

I was disappointed when I finished the book and then heard all the news of actual events.  However, while reading I did assume that incidents had been slightly exaggerated.  Bottom line worth reading and there probably is something you will take from this book.

B00003W8NM|4.0|This weird critique of modern culture suceeds artistically.  It is flawed due to plot problems but if you allow yourself to enjoy the great acting and the gutsy humor it captivates.<br /><br />Norton and Pitt are superb and so is Helena Bonham Carter.

Whether you take this as the portrait of an interesting psychotic break or go with the notion that people need violence in order to feel alive, this story provides a refreshing departure from traditional films.
B00004RJ71|2.0|A trusted friend of mine highly recommended this movie and has seen it himself many times - likening it to some of the best action dramas ever made. I watched the film in great anticipation, but I just couldn't get into the plot. It was all balls and bravado, but no real acting or believable dialogue, which for me made it hard to get into. The story was really interesting and to me really illustrated the intertwining of the character's lives, and how outside influences as well as the choices each one has made each alter the course of their lives - even as they go down their own, very separate, paths. I give the story a lot of credit for originality; that is where the movie shines - but the movie just seemed to drag on and on like a life sentence. I only watched to see the ending out of morbid curiosity or perhaps even to see if somehow it would turn out better and make me forget about the rest of the movie. That didn't happen, so here I am....writing this epithet. Really, I don't like leaving bad remarks, but what did me in for this movie was the bad acting, the overused prison-gang lingo, and some of the cheesiest lines ever imagined. \\"I don't want his porkchop. I want his life!\\" Gimme a break.... This one seems to have alot of fans, but is not for me.

To be successful, we simply must understand how it works and the influence it has over our lives.  This book is very well written, easy to read, full of useful information that if absorbed and followed, will help in every facet of your life.<br /><br />I have given away many copies and recommended it to many others.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />As with all classic books, you should read it often.  There are so many lessons, you will gain new insights with each reading.

Yet, she manages to entertain and make us feel she is just one of us even though she is a successful writer traveling the world. It made me feel I am not alone in the struggle to find true happiness. It also opened my mind to the fact happiness is not something you find outside of yourself  -- it is with you all the time if you just listen to your inner self.  She conveyed that sometimes it takes traveling around the world to open your mind and find you have the power to be happy in your own back yard.

I think anyone can pick up valuable lessons from this book regardless of when or how they earn their living.  Oh sure, there are lots of people out there who'll make excuses, \\"oh, I work 2 shifts in a row every other day of the week\\" etc; but the truth is that FlyLady's pattern of routines can be incorporated into anyone's schedule with a little ingenuity.  What I've come to learn over the years is that it's often those with the dirtiest, sloppiest homes who come up with the biggest number of excuses as to why they can't find a solution that works - - that's how they got into and STAY in the mess that they're in! <br />From week #1, following FlyLady's steps and routines began to lift a terrible burden from me and my family.  Prior to that, weekly housecleaning had been a horrible exercise that felt like forced labor.  The CHAOS or, Can't Have Anyone Over Syndrome, fit us like a glove and planned company was often accompanied by frantic days of backbreaking marathons of scrambling to jam clutter any place out of sight and then rushing to clean the rest of the house with often only minutes to spare before our guests arrived at our front door.  We don't do that anymore.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Normally I ramble on and on, but my doing so will be lost on this film, so I'll not bother.  Suffice to say, this is probably my favorite film from last year, and definitely my favorite so-called 'space opera' of all-time.  This is one of those films that has got it all:  Good action, interesting, dynamic and most of all, very likable characters, emotional resonance, lotsa extremely funny dialogue and last but not least, zombies.  Yet, despite it's being a 'fun' movie, it's not with out a darker edge, and it feels more substantiative then most films of this sort.  Nathan Fillion's Mal Reynolds is a classic character.  Yes he's just the outwardly cynical anti-hero who is actually somewhat idealistic at heart archetype, but this is probably my favorite sort of hero, and he plays it as well as anyone ever has.  Chiwetel Elijofor is also especially good as the villainous Operative.  He's another typical character, the cold and polite yet ruthless villain-killer, but he gives the role a bit more depth then it usually has.  Here Whedon wrote a character that reminds us that most 'villains' don't think of themselves as such (Though the Operative, ironically, does) and are still quite human.  The film also deserves credit for just allowing a somewhat novel take on the genre.  This sorta genre has always been associated with westerns, but this is the only instance where I think that the connection has been overt, and I think it's a very effective combination.<br /><br />My only complaint is that even at 2 hours in length the movie seems to end only as it's getting started.  Too bad, but what is there is so good that I can't complain too much.<br /><br />Grade: A
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Excellent cast, funny, romantic and warm. A family movie...something that you will watch from time to time over & over again....I have  given many movies for birthdays and holidays ..this is one you give to your family and closest friends...they will treasure it forever...Judy Garland and the whole supporting cast were wonderful...A master piece...You'll enjoy it!!

B00005JOUM|5.0|I have seen most of Spike Lee's previous films, admiring some more than others. To me, he resembles the proverbial little girl with the curl. That said, I think his Inside Man is very, very good in most respects. Four compelling screen actors so thoroughly inhabit the characters entrusted to them that -- as with Jamie Foxx in Ray and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Capote -- they are the characters whom they portray. I was intrigued by the lively interaction between and among Detective Keith Frazier, Madeline White, Dalton Russell, and Arthur Chase rather than recognizing Washington, Foster, Owen, and Plummer at work. One Star for that. I also admire Lee's juxtaposition of  volatile plot developments with moments of quiet, almost lyrical reflection. Another Star for pace. And praise, also,  to the cinematographer (Matthew J. Libatque), the composer of the score (Terence Blanchard), and especially the screenwriter Russell Gewitz) for collaborating so effectively with Lee to integrate image, sound, and dialogue from beginning to end. That's Three Stars so far.<br /><br />Add another for a meticulously planned bank robbery which Lee develops smoothly but unhurriedly within a multi-dimensional plot featuring the robbery itself as well as high-level power brokering within and beyond the NYPD and even City Hall. Lee and Gewitz share the credit for this. Others who have reviewed this film cite similarities with other films such as Dog Day Afternoon and there are a few but make no mistake about it: Inside Man is in no way derivative of any others. I think it is unique, albeit comparable with L.A. Confidential, Heat, and Pulp Fiction in terms of its brilliant examination of cultural ambiguities.<br /><br />As for the last Star, whether or not those who see this film share Lee's perspectives on race relations, whether or not they share his social values, I suggest that he is wholly consistent with those perspectives and values while exploring in this film a multiple of interpersonal relationships which include but are not --ultimately -- defined by racial issues. In fact, racial issues are subordinate to the narrative which he so carefully develops. The situation initially seems to be a crisis with life-or-death implications for the hostages as well as for those committed to rescuing them. By the end of this film, however, we realize that Lee's primary purpose is to tell an entertaining, at times compelling story rather than to exploit the on-going drama as a means by which to express a polemic.<br /><br />Well-done.ps which include but are not --ultimately -- defined by racial issues.

B000000P17|3.0|This is Guns N' Roses' slightly odd and somewhat pointless album of cover songs.  It's definitely not at the same level as their previous works and it is a little disjointed, but at the same time it's not that bad.    To me, the band seemed to be trying to return to the simpler, pure rock style that they had during their \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" days, as opposed to the extravagant art-rock style of the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" days.  Their new rhythm guitarist---Gilby Clarke---is also introduced here.  (Curiously, Axl plays a much smaller role in this album than the previous albums---he is the only band member whose photograph is not in the artwork, and he is not even featured at all on a few songs.)    There are a few standout tracks, such as \\"Since I Don't Have You,\\" \\"Ain't it Fun,\\" and \\"Black Leather,\\" and there is also the (in)famous hidden track.  The songs are fun songs, but to me they just don't have the same substance as their original material.     I recommend this for established Guns N' Roses fans, but I think that newcomers and everyone else should probably check out their original material first.

B000056TKC|5.0|A wonderful recording! As regards the technical issues I think it equals the best of recordings. The sound is intense, dynamic, you really hear the symphonic sound - the different characters of the instruments. Musically is it intense, architectural, titanic in strength and power. Build up from the misty chords opening the symphony to the concluding manic happiness, hope and joy in the last movement. Conductor Fricsay really created music created by the great Beethoven. Fischer-Dieskau is fantastic in his opening of the vocal part in the last movement. The only complain I can have is the bit strained voice of Irmgard Seefried on certain top-notes. - This is a VERY great recording!
1592401791|5.0|This is a terrific book, vital reading to any Beatles fan who is curious about what was going on during the session that inspired the sounds, how certain sounds were created or recorded, and how the relationship within and without the Beatles grew and died. It's a great companion to the Mark Lewisholm's, 'The Complete Recording Sessions' - providing more of a narrative than that chronicle and touching more on the inspiration and events than just the facts on the recording session.  <br /> <br />Fascinating glimpse into the relationships going on with the key players and very interesting to learn about some of the simmering tensions that existed from very early on in the piece.  Normally, we only hear of the tensions that surfaced from about 1968 onwards.  But it's not written as a juicy, scandal-driven expose like Goldman or possibly Philip Norman's books. On the contrary, Emerick seems to have no axe to grind with anyone but describes an actual event or relationship and, on occasion, then gives his personal opinion on what might have been the driving force behind it.  But the facts and the sounds are the predominant focus. <br /> <br />I couldn't spot the errors that another reviewer did. I would describe McCartney's 'Many Years From Now' as a book peppered with errors, but not this book. <br /> <br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that it was impossible to put it down.  I'm on my third time going back through it.  It's the kind of book I've been waiting for.  Probably my favorite Beatle book and the only book that's ever driven me to write a review here at Amazon.  I wish he had been around at more of the sessions - Rubber Soul and the latter White Album sessions especially. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor!
B000002KMY|4.0|One of the downsides of having such a big music collection like I have is that sometimes it will take me years after buying an album before I actually sit down and listen to it thoroughly from start to finish. The Mob Rules was unfortunately one of those albums. I put off really listening to it for several, silly reasons...one was the album title itself, which seemed so..umm...MOBBISH! Another reason was the cover, which I thought was a bit disturbing, even for this band! And my third reason was the songs themselves, which somehow didn't impress me too much the first time around.<br /><br />Well, I am happy to report that after listening to this album OVER AND OVER again this past month, that I now absolutely love it. Is it as good as ' Heaven and Hell '? Probably not, but for the time being, I actually like it better, probably due to the fact that I'm not as familiar with it. As with it's predecessor (or it's two or three  predecessors), the first half is much stronger than the second half, though I'm finding that I really like the last two songs quite a bit now. This is also a terrific sounding album, especially the bass guitar and drums. Not only was this Sab's second album with Dio, it was also their second album with producer/engineer Martin Birch, who once again, seems to have brought out the best in bassist Geezer Butler. The drumming, too, by Vinnie Appice, is outstanding, particularly on the album's centerpiece, ' The Sign of the Southern Cross '.<br /><br />The album starts off with a fast and heavy one, \\"Turn Up The Night\\", not one of the strongest lead off tracks on a Sabbath album, but still darn good in its own right. 'Voodoo' is another good song, but the album really picks up with seven minute plus ' The Sign of the Sothern Cross ', which is easily my favorite tune here. The whole band sounds great on this...I love Iommi's guitar riff and the spooky synthesizers underneath it, Dio's lyrics, and Appice's drumming, which I think may be his best ever; I love all of those drum fills he tosses in! ' E5150 ' is an eerie and atmospheric keyboard and synthesizer and effects driven instrumental, that leads right into the kick butt title track, another fast one along the lines of 'Turn Up The Night' only much better.<br /><br />The second half starts off with what I think is it's two weakest tunes, ' Country Girl ', which has an Irish Pub singalongable quality about it during the verses, and the throwaway track ' Slipping Away ', on which Geezer gets a chance to play some bass solos. The last two tracks are somewhat better...I particularly like the fast part during 'Falling off the Edge of the World ' and ' Over and Over', though somewhat repetitous, has some great soloing from Iommi...though they are not on par with the great stuff from the first half.<br /><br />So, this album is heavy, has some great songs, and it sounds terrific when played loud. What more could one ask from a Black Sabbath album?er; I love all of those drum fills he tosses in!

B000AMJDHY|5.0|Great FUSION album!  What's Fusion?  It is a sign of a great new step in the evolution of music as we know it.  Bands/Artists without restrictions, seamlessly blending one style of music with another without sticking to a single duality going from Dance-Rock to Pop-Rock, digging in tossing a little Funk-folk and spinning it with a heady jazz undertone & having it all on one album. <br /> <br />This is what music should be:  fun, experimental and boundary-less (I can't get the song out of my head).  Enjoy this album; you won't be able to stop yourself.  Well you won't be able to stop yourself unless you are a manically depressed wannabe musician from Dull-Youth, MN who takes other people's opinions way too seriously.

0783231202|4.0|As with all movies about history, I review them from the perspective of the history teacher and leave all of the other particulars to the other reviewers. In this case, however, I'd like to address the Amazon review (written by Dave McCoy) as well. McCoy states that the director (noneother than Steven Speilberg) feels compelled \\"to entertain with beautiful images and contrived emotion . . . [and] . . . cheapens his grandiose motives and simplifies slavery, treating it as cut- and-dry genre piece. Characters are easy Hollywood stereotypes--'villains' like the Spanish sailors or zealous abolitionists are drawn one-dimensionally and sneered upon.\\" For the record, I'll say that I agree wholeheartedly---but in this case, an excellent movie still unfolds and a story that SHOULD be told is told! Also, let me address a fellow reviewer's (Leon Washington) remark that those who slam this movie are guilty of racism. I don't necessarily think that those who give this movie bad reviews are categorically racist, but I do think they may be missing the \\"big picture\\" here. Alright, let's get on with the review.<br /><br />High school and college history teachers---this movie is a must see for numerous reasons. For one, Anthony Hopkins does a superb job (as expected) of portraying John Quincy Adams. His performance is worth the price of admission alone. Yet, many students may find his performance a bit boring. Herein lies the problem with the real history---this movie is based upon a real-life courtroom drama. Much of the movie is set within the courtroom and let's face it, most high school students will typically begin yawning. This is not necessarily so, however,  with \\"Amistad.\\" You see, it's the very fact that Speilberg DOES create sensationalism---\\"Hollywood moments\\" if you will---that saves this movie from being a yawner! It may be true that some characters are oversimplified villains, but all good movies have some sort of antagonist.<br /><br />Many reviewers have trouble with Speilberg's portrayal of the events aboard the infamous slaveship, Secora. I disagree completely. This is a realistic depiction of what could happen on any given day aboard a \\"slaver.\\" ****Note**** While riveting with its \\"shock and awe,\\" young viewers (under 12) probably should not see these horrific scenes for the usual reasons.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Speilberg takes a bit of poetic license when presenting this film. Who cares? This is a story that should be told and Speilberg does so excellently. Even political science students should see this since it also serves as a testimony of U.S. diplomacy and foreign policy during the mid-nineteenth century.<br /><br />High school teachers, please don't exclude this great movie from your list based upon the negative reviews of critics. You'll be glad you showed it and your students will be all the wiser! Please show it within it's relative time period as well. In other words, don't just show it during Black History Month.<br /><br />So, what should students LEARN from this movie?<br /><br />First --- Students should be able to parallel the events of this drama with the events that would soon unfold in America (Civil War). In other words, they should be able to see how the decision of the Supreme Court would have been a victory for abolitionists and a defeat for pro-slavery advocates like John Calhoun.<br /><br />Second --- Students should discuss the Monroe Doctrine in relation to our treaty with Spain. Does the U.S. violate her treaty, or are we following our own self-revealed destiny?<br /><br />Third --- Students should use this movie as support for a discussion of how Great Britain attempted to enforce its ban on slavery and how Spain and Portugal attempted to continue slavery in their colonies.with Speilberg's portrayal of the events aboard the infamous slaveship, Secora.

B000E5N62U|5.0|Look up the term \\"cool cat\\" in the encyclopedia. If you don't see a picture of Donald Fagen, don't worry ~ one day you will; cross-reference under methodical, original, meticulous, and perfection. Donald Fagen's third solo album Morph the Cat manages to be as playful as a kitten and as serious a lion stalking its prey without missing a beat. A good front-man is like the leader of a safari, taking the listener to exotic places and showing them all kinds of wild and crazy things. Both as a solo artist and as half of the musical powerhouse known as Steely Dan, Donald Fagen is one of the best in the business in that respect. Morph the Cat is a deep, rich jungle of sounds inhabited by many an exotic creature. The vocals on this album sway like chiffon drapes in a gentle summer breeze, flawless in their motion, and the lyrics alternate effortlessly between frisky and foreboding.    Any Major Dude could tell you that Fagen has a superb track-record of combining intelligent lyrics with quirky pop, set on a background that fusses rock with syncopated jazz. Morph the Cat lives up to and exceeds those high expectation. This Gaucho really knows his stuff. The first single H Gang, with its bouncing rhythms and halcyon harmonies, would have sounded right at home on his first album \\"The Night Fly\\", but this is a much darker collection then either of his previous solo releases. Perhaps it is the maturity that comes with age combined with the realities of the post 9/11 world, but gone is the unsinkable optimism of songs like I.G.Y.. What is offered in place of that optimism is a realism that is no less enticing, and possibly even more exiting. The world just isn't that safe anymore.    That's What I Do is as beautiful tribute to Ray Charles as ever could be written, simultaneously capturing \\"the essence of\\" and paying honor to the man. Mary Shut the Garden Door speaks to the darker trends of nesting in our modern world where there are a great many things we need to shut out. The Great Pagoda of Funn takes it even further:    The stars are bright tonight   The air is sweet   Though summer's over now   There's a strange new music in the street   You and I   Know the world can't be like this   Its our love that makes it shine   Girl - whatever trouble waits outside these walls   We're safe inside this house of light   We make up our own storyline     Fagen's commentary on the state of the world today is not all gloom and doom. Security Jones reminds us of how much fun a good \\"pat-down\\" can be, if it is done in the right way by the right person. If you by this album, make sure the version you get includes the bonus track, a cover of Al Green's Rhymes, on which producer/musician extraordinaire Todd Rundgren coaxes what is possibly the best vocal performance of his career out of Mr. Fagen.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I loved this movie.  I've seen the stage production so I already had a higher standard in mind for a movie.

630522577X|5.0|March 2006 marked the 50th anniversary of the opening on Broadway of Lerner and Loew's My Fair Lady.  I was priveleged to see the original starring Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews.  Fifty years later we are still humming the songs from this beautiful play.  In the mid-1960s Audrey Hepburn brought Eliza Doolittle to the silver screen.  I thought no one could replace Julie Andrews as Eliza.  I must admit that I was very much mistaken.  Despite the fact that it's not Audrey singing, she took to the role of Eliza as if it was especially created for her and gave a magnificent performance. Sadly, Audrey was cheated out of the Oscar for Best Actress in 1965. The My Fair Lady DVD of the movie version is of high quality and is a wonderful way to preserve this classic film.  I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages.
B0001MDQ6W|4.0|Dylan is of course the master of the political lyric. With this set of songs it takes one on a jouney back through time, to HIS roots. The selection of songs is outstanding. The throat catches on occassion with the truth in his word. The band meshes incredibly well with all players giving a more than credible performance. Despite the fact that organ and pedal are plugged, without them the performance would not have been as great. <br />Stellar performance by the folk singer!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|In my review of Dookie I stated that Green Day is THE most influential band of the late -90's (basically right after Kurt Coabians death) to today, and American Idiot is the continuation of their dominance. With a teriible administration (my opinion of course) in the white4 house, they took the stand and bashed Bush adn all in their rock opera. <br /> <br />People have complained that American Idiot is not punk, and is an embarrasment to the punk rock world. This is 100% correct and that is the brilliance of theis record and the maturity of Green Day. This is not a punk-rock album, and Green Day does not want it to be one. THis is totally differnet than say, Good Charloote calling themselves punk. Green Day WAS punk-rock, and the perfection of punk at that (although The Ramones may have something to say about that), but now that they have all entered their thirties and grown older, singing about masturbation and all-out anarchy would not be listenable anymore. <br /> <br />With American Idiot they have expanded their limitations as a band, and changed for the better. They have released what should be the modern standard for what all of these other poser bands release. American Idiot is not punk, it is not, to a certain point, hard-rock. It is purely rock and roll, and a breilliant record. <br /> <br />Sorry, for all the rambling, but now to the album. To me, the worst song is American Idiot, and it is not that bad. They totally changed their image and sound. Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming are modern forms of Bohemian Rhapsody setting the scene and closing out this beautiful story of life in the modern world. My personal favorite song is Holiday, whose hard-rock/pop feel makes for an interesting combination and lasting melody. Whatsername, to me, is another classic and Letterbomb should be a single soon as well. Yet, with all these great songs the greatest acheivement may be Wake Me Up Till September Ends. This is the story of Billie Joe getting over the loss of his father, and is beautifully written and played. ALthough it may not sound like a classic, it is the best evidence of Green Day's musical growth and devleopment. <br /> <br />From the punk strains of Dookie, it has been a long journey for this band to, as Rolling Stone put it, conquer the musical world, and with American Idiot they did just that.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Highway To Hell, This is AC/DC's 6th album, and their last with flamboyant front man Bon Scott. Released in 1979, Highway was the first of three collaborations with Mutt Lange, the other two being Back In Black, and For Those About To Rock. With Mutt At the helm, AC/DC brought a little bit of spit and polish to the game with this album. Mutt, has been known to make over the top rock n roll records, and with Highway To Hell, he makes no changes or apololies.<br /><br />Highway To Hell 10/10 - This is the very best AC/DC song with Bon at the helm. I am not saying everyone will agree, but in my onwn mind Bon's very best song ever. Also the best song on the album.<br /><br />Girls Got Rhythm 10/10 - Another rockin' song from the guys, once you hear it, it gets stuck in your head and you can't get it out. Best if played at maximum volume.<br /><br />Walk All Over You 8/10 - This song rocks and everything, but for some reason not one of my personal favs off the album.<br /><br />Touch Too Much 10/10 - This is my fourth favorite tune on the album, just give it one listen and you'll know what I mean. Awesome song from the very beginning.<br /><br />Beating Around The Bush 8/10 - This song is a straight ahead rocker, but lacks a little something in my mind, don't get me wrong its good just something missing.<br /><br />Shot Down In Flames 10/10 - Ahh, my second favorite song off the album, without a doubt one of the greatest songs ever written by AC/DC with Bon or Brian.<br /><br />Get It Hot 8/10 - Another good piece of rock n roll, not my personal favorite, but great non the less.<br /><br />If You Want Blood (You've Got It) 10/10 - This is my third favorite song on the album, another masterpiece with Mr. Scott at the helm. Just one listen and you will think the same thing, if not I would start to wonder if you really like hard rock!<br /><br />Love Hungry Man 8/10 - With this song I won't play it up or down, just give it a listen or two and decide for yourself if you like it. This is not a song I hit replay alot on, but who knows you might love it.<br /><br />Night Prowler 8/10 - This is a bit of a blues tune, a really kickn' blues song, give it a listen and you be the judge.<br /><br />Overall, I would give Highway To Hell, 10/10 stars, this is the best album with Bon, and my second favorite AC/DC album ever. If you don't have this already buy the remastered version with the extra pics and stuff, but if you have it already then you know exactly what I have tried to say in this review. It makes me wonder sometimes what would have happened had Bon never died, would they be better than they are right now?

B00004S6GL|4.0|My guess is whichever Elliott Smith Cd that you listen to first will probably become your favorite if his style is to your liking.  Every one of his solo recordings are at least strong.  And each is different.  \\"Figure 8\\" probably deviates more from his style than any other recording except \\"Basement\\".  It rocks harder than his earlier recordings and his influences tend to shine through more on this album.  My favorites are \\"Color Bars\\", \\"Wouldn't Mama Be Proud\\" and the two selections which start with the word \\"Everything\\" which seem to be two movements of one song.  My rating is really 4 1/2 stars and is only docked because it is not quite as good as \\"X/O\\".

I give too much energy fighting things that I'm not going to be able to change. The early chapters of this book felt as if they were written especially for me.  I read them while on a silent retreat, so I had time to really hear what I needed to hear from Tolle.  The latter chapters I found to be less relevant, but nonetheless, this book has given me substantial meat to chew and a new way to see others. <br /> <br />Connie Shelley
B000002OX7|5.0|Simply (IMHO) the greatest classic rock CD of all time.  First there is perhaps the greatest album ender of all time in \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" which is the very definition of rock anthem.  Next, you have four extreme classic rock cuts in \\"Baba O'Reilly\\", \\"Bargain\\", \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", and \\"The Song Is Over\\".  It also contains the very strong John Entwistle cut \\"My Wife\\" which is absolutely hillarious.  \\"In Tune\\" is one of the most beautiful pieces ever written and \\"Goin Mobile\\" would have been memorable on most other albums.  The only song not mentioned yet \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" is strong in it's own right.  I believe the song \\"Long Live Rock\\" was cut from these sessions so obviously this was a very productive time in their careers.  If you are a classic rock fan, this CD is a must.  If you are not, you might become a fan after listening to this! <br />
0156027321|3.0|I really hoped the book was going to fulfill its promise of \\"a story to make you believe in God,\\" but I never found a hint of it.  I do think the tagline should be \\"a story to make you believe in yourself\\" or something about individual strength. When I started I was eager and happy, but half way through I was ready for it to end.  I found it very unbelievable and the ending haunting and disappointing.  It could of been better, if it was focused on Pi's love for God, or even went towards Pi's self discovery and inner strength, but it did neither.  I never got the part of the Frenchman or the alternate story - but now I don't care - its ruined.  And why are students reading this for high school? I wish I had a book club to help understand it.
B00000373U|5.0|This is my second favorite Elliott Smith Cd behind \\"X/O\\".  Really every song on the album is strong but the tempo of the CD rarely goes beyond quiet.  As I write the reviews for his music and listen to the songs, I can only think of what a tragic loss this was.  Favorites on this Cd are \\"Rose Parade\\", \\"Ballad of Big Nothing\\", and \\"Pictures of Me\\" which is the only uptempo song on the CD.  Brilliant!
B000E97HIA|5.0|Some one gave this cd 1 star!!!We know they are not a TRUE Prince fan just by the fact that they say since his last great album was Graffiti Bridge .That being said WOW unbievable,no words can even discribe how good 3121 is.Oh ya I can think of one word to discribe it ...............PRINCE!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
B00009V7T2|5.0|I can say without hesitation that The Mars Volta is my favourite new band at the moment.  They bring something completely new to the table, blending elements of free jazz, Latin music, punk and progressive rock to create something truly unique and exciting.  For those of you who are new to the band, this is probably a good place to start.   <br /> <br />This album is The Mars Volta's first full-length release and for new fans, it will certainly be easier to digest than 2005's 'Frances The Mute'.  It has all the hallmarks of an album by The Mars Volta, superb instrumentation, dynamic shifts in tempo and mood and cryptic lyrics, but it is more firmly grounded in rock and less blatantly experimental.  If you like this, then give yourself permission to become acquainted with the rest of The Mars Volta's work. This album pulls no punches, it's straight to the point.  It's really powerful stuff.  I really don't know what else to say. <br /> <br />'De-Loused in the Comatorium' is a fantastic album from a fantastic band.  Prepare to be addicted by the unpredictability of the music.  Fans of progressive rock will love this!  If any band is going to bring progressive rock back to the forefront, it's The Mars Volta.  This album takes some time to get used to, but it's worth it. Buy it now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really have to hand it to Joss Whedon, this really is an awesome show. I hated Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Also by Joss.) But this... this is pure gold, and cancelled after less than a season? Shame on you Fox. But to make up for it, they gave us this: The boxed set of the entire first season, even the episodes they never aired. <br /> <br />But what really makes this show? You might ask. Well, it's the characters. Mal, Kaylee, Jayne; all of them are absolute genius. In their own way they are each funny and interesting and the way they interact seems natural as well as well written. I have not seen characters I have loved so much in a long time, on the same level as characters from good literature. <br /> <br />Another thing which makes this show is it's setting, there is an undeniable wild west flavor to the entire show from the firearms to the fiddles and twangs of the soundtrack, to their method of speech. (Which I find extremely charming.)  <br /> <br />Let us not forget the story! It isn't... outstanding, but it is interesting and keeps you guessing. I had the general flow of the story layed out for me by Serenity (The movie based off of the show.) and it's what got me interested to begin with. But the show still held a lot of surprises. And the setting is in the distant future, when man is colonizing space, the final frontier (I believe this to be the reason for the wild west theming.) <br /> <br />I really can't suggest this highly enough if you even remotely like Sci-Fi, a Sci-Fi with no aliens and a somewhat believable vision of the Terran future of mankind.
B000A6T262|5.0|This is a must have for all Star Trek fans who want a complete and quality set of every movie made. The audio and video is of high quality as are the additional DVD's with each movie. My only gripe is the overall size of the package. There are two DVD's per case but each case is rather wide making the whole collection take up considerable room in your DVD storage case or whatever you might use.
B00006IU73|5.0|Porcupine Tree came as a big surprise to me.  My musical tastes in rock range from XTC to Adrian Belew to Supergrass to Martin Newell, by way of Pink Floyd, the Beatles, King Crimson, and Black Sabbath, and most music recommendation engines tend to refer the same list of suggested artists to me.  But then, on Pandora.com, a song by Porcupine Tree popped up and I was immediately a fan.  In one listen.  It happened to be Gravity Eyelids from In Absentia.  I was immediately struck not only by its musicality, with great rhythmic changes, stunning melodies and guitar riffs, and the perfect vocals to match, but the way it was able to infuse the best qualities of many bands that have inspired me -- not only the ones I've listed above, but others, including Rush, Blue Oyster Cult, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Nine Inch Nails, and even Genesis.  This is an eclectic mix, but they pull it off with aplomb.<br /><br />Blackest Eyes, and incredibly strong opening song, follows the bands oft-used form of marrying accoustic and highly melodic sections with hard driving, distorted guitar progressions.  Behind a nicely resonant steel-string acoustic rhythm, pale organs float against harmonies and swirl into a syncopated Nine Inch Nail's style bridge.  Trains, another fantastic song, is generally lighter, with unusual instrumentation, including a lightly picked banjo. It reminds me of Agents of Fortune/Spectres era BOC, with the sensibilities of modern alternative rock ... \\"When I hear the engine pass * I'm kissing you wide * The hissing subsides ... When the evening reaches * You're tying me up * I'm dying of love * It's okay ...\\"  Lips of Ashes blends Crosby, Stills & Nash style harmonies with a Pink Floyd feel.  The Sound of Muzak is perhaps the most pop-oriented of the album's tracks, and immediately catchy, describing the end of music in favor of industrialized, elevator Prozac:  \\"Now the sound of music * Comes in silver pills * Engineered to suit you * Building cheaper thrills,\\" and warning that \\"One of the wonders of of the world is going down ...\\"<br /><br />I love every song of this album to one degree or another.  Prodigal, Wedding Nails, Heartattack in a Layby, and Collapse the Light Into Earth are all stand-outs.  A great album that will likely lead you explore the band's many other albums ...d warning that \\"One of the wonders of of the world is going down ...\\" <br /> <br />I love every song of this album to one degree or another.

0553801503|2.0|I've heard it said that you can quit watching a daytime soap opera for a couple of months and come back and pick right up where you left off without missing much.  A Feast for Crows accomplishes just that.  The first three books in this series were fantastic, fast paced and shocking in every chapter.  The last four or five chapters of this book sum it up and contain everything you'll need to know for upcoming books.  I was glad to finally finish the book.   <br /> <br />The story gets hard to follow because there are so many characters that are only briefly introduced, then glossed over.  So much of what is said, is just fluff and really doesn't have anything to do with the story.  I hope the next book in the series shows more promise or I doubt I'll even bother with it.
B000005HFH|3.0|People are a bit too crazy with all the 5 star reviews.  From a technical standpoint, he is a pretty poor vocalist.  Most of the jazz vocals I have heard in local clubs are better than Chet and as for more widely known, recorded artists, they all leave Chet in the dust.  Of course, technical skill is not the whole thing.  Certain vocalists have a way of singing that resonates with some people.  Chet is one of those kinds of singers.  It is certainly possible to love his singing, but for many people, it would be an acquired taste.  For those who really put a lot of emphasis on technical skills, it is unlikely that they will ever be able to deal with Chet the singer.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This is a great movie about a guy that has lots of moments in his childhood he doesn't remember. But, he wrote them on a journal. Anytimme he wants to remember, he reads his journal but with the ability of changing what has happened...
B000E33VWW|5.0|\\"Capote\\" is an account of Truman Capote's decision and execution of writing the nonfiction book \\"In cold blood\\".  I have never read his work, but after viewing this movie, I plan to.  He was unusual, interesting, talented, and even funny.<br /><br />Philip Seymoure Hoffman's acting was amazing. He was so deservant of his Oscar.  I've always been a fan of his and this movie is his truly shining star in the galaxy of celluloid.<br /><br />Also, Catharine Keener was very good as writer,(one of my faves at that) Harper Lee, who penned the classic \\"to kill a mockingbird\\".<br /><br />I really think Capote wanted to write something non fiction which is why he was looking in the new york times that day he found the article about the murders of the family in Kansas.  He did everthing in his power to get as much research to create thie book.  It took him years to finish the book due to the fact that Perry Smith, one of the convicted killers, wouldnt' tell Capote details about the crimes he committed.<br /><br />I think \\"Capote\\" is one of the best films to come out of 2005.  Everything about this movie was brilliant.  I highly recommend it to the movie fan who appreciates all genres of film.
0684824906|1.0|The quality of the book itself was a problem. First I recieved a book with the cover or binding was on backwards; such that the book was upside down and backwards within the book binding. I returned it. I spent $8 shipping it back to Amazon and got a $1 credit for shipping. When I got my replacement book; the book cover was not printed in line with the embossed wording. I am not going to spend another $8 to return yet ANOTHER DEFECTIVE book. So I am stuck having paid full price for a product that is defective (twice in a row!). It really disappoints me and discourages me from using Amazon. Where is your quality control?
B00005NKK8|5.0|Been looking for it for a long time.  A great collection of music.  The service and delivery were wonderful.

0596007124|5.0|This book is definitely not the patterns Nirvana, and it may not make you the patterns guru, but it sure is a great book, extremely well written to welcome the beginner to the world of patterns. I first tried reading the GOF book (Eric Gamma, John Vslides...) - certainly a bible but a heavy read and especially so if you are just getting started with design patterns. Not this one! It really introduces some of the basic concepts very well to lead you to understand how the patterns came into being and then goes forward to drill the pattern into your head. The new approach to technical writing is fantastic and does the job. Once I master this book and practice the patterns, I am sure I will be able to move to the next level and maybe I will be better able to understand the GOF bible which I learn is a must read for any serious techie! You do have to be a little imaginative to figure out which pattern can be used where, in real world designs. The examples are very easy to understand but that makes them a little bit too simplistic for an implementation in the real world. Would have liked a section that lists out some usages in real world - my only recommendation. Other than that, this book will get you up and running quickly with patterns!
B00005JOQ9|1.0|This film is not a horror film, there is no suspense or tension at all. The first half is just unneccessary porn with the second being of sensless sadistic torture. The gore is not really that disgusting, the more disgusting aspect is that someone would have the mentality to create, write, produce or even 'star' in a movie such as this.  <br /> <br />To be honest it is a disgrace that this movie should be allowed into mainstream viewing at all.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I usually don't have the time to write reviews.<br /><br />After listening a few times to this CD , I had this sudden urge to share it with everyone.<br /><br />This album is brilliant on so many levels. Wish I had heard this 20 years ago as it would have made my introduction to Jazz so much easier.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just finished watching all of the episodes, and I was very sad to see them end.  This is an amazingly funny and well written show.  I found myself laughing non-stop.  There are also great action scenes as well.  The cast couldn't be better, and their enjoyment of the show and of eachother comes across on screen.  If only I had known about the show when it originally came out.  Better marketing and this could have been a lasting hit.
B000006UNG|5.0|This album was so unexpectedly ahead of its time in 1986 people are still catching up to it twenty years later, although that's not a bad thing.  Colour of Spring is one of those rare albums that can be appreciated on a lot of levels.  The first thing people always notice about Talk Talk is Mark Hollis's unique nasal-congested voice, and his slurred annunciation.  It's often hard to make out the lyrics of a Talk Talk song, which in an odd way is what makes them interesting, in the same way that Michael Stipe's delivery adds a little bit of enigma to a lot of early REM songs.  While many of the lyrics are a bit cryptic, Hollis offers a generally philosophical look at humanity, although at moments he can turn quite caustic.  As hinted in the album title, there's a general interest here in the cycle of nature, and thus this album's positioning in \\"spring\\" reflects a desire to simplify and focus on the important things in life, admonishing listeners not to lose sight of the importance celebrating the simple beauty of the world and living for the present.  It's not all oblique cryptograms however, as in this verse from the opening track \\"Happiness is Easy\\"    \\"It wrecks me how they justify their acts of war  They assemble, they pray  Take good care of what the priests say  'After death it's so much fun'  Little sheep don't let your feet stray\\"    What shouldn't be underestimated is the incredible feeling and power Hollis imbues into these songs. Hollis's vocals are deceptively effortless, and it's not until you hear someone attempt a Talk Talk song (Gwen Stefani for example, with her recent cover of 'It's my life') that you really appreciate what an incredible singer this guy was during this time period.  The Colour of Spring is nothing less than the essential Talk Talk album, an album of artists at their creative and commercial peak, focused solely on the composition and recording process as an end in itself. Colour of Spring is Talk Talk's \\"Sgt Pepper's\\" if I might risk the employment of that overused cliche.      Having begun their life as a synth-pop band often associated with other bands of the time, most notably Duran Duran (as they shared the same producer initially) Hollis chaffed at EMI's attempts to market Talk Talk in the same vein as other synth pop bands, and despite the eventual success of several singles including \\"Talk Talk\\" opted for a change in direction and soon parted ways with synth keboardist Simon Brenner, leaving the band free to employ session musicians, as it was now comprised of a three person nucleus of singer, bassist and drummer.    The creative turning point for Talk Talk came when they met producer/Keyboardist/Songwriter Tim Friese-Greene, who would become a major force in the genesis of the band, co-writing many of their best and most popular songs, and playing on the tracks of Colour of Spring. Thanks to the success of the title single from their second album \\"It's my life\\", EMI allowed the band a lot of time and freedom in recording the follow up, and with Friese-Green, they began to adopt an improvisational Jazz approach, bringing in a variety of musicians (most notably Steve Winwood who plays Organ on a number of tracks) who were allowed to vibe and do whatever they felt like.  If Friese-Green and the band didn't like the outcome they simply left it out of the final mix.    There are a number of songs on the album that have an undeniable, almost tribal groove thanks to the small army of percussionists employed.  A myriad of instruments were used on most tracks, including Piano, Harp, Organ, sax, mellotron, variophon, Harmonica and Dobro.  The resulting product was a solid top 10 UK hit, and a critical home run, which would also turn out to be the last album of its kind, as Talk Talk's subsequent albums veered into experimental territory, never to return.  For a brief moment, Colour of Spring planted Talk Talk unexpectedly at the forefront of popular recorded music, and had Hollis not chosen to retreat, I imagine given the bands who have clearly followed in the album's footsteps (Radiohead, Coldplay, Keane and Sigur Ros most recently) that Talk Talk could easily have become one of the most popular bands in the world.  Instead, they took over 2 and a half years to record the deliberately anti commercial \\"'Spirit of Eden\\" with Hollis expressing no interest in singles, videos or a tour to support.  Some rumors began to float around that Hollis was addicted to Heroin, but the fact's were a lot simpler: by the time Colour of Spring was released, all the members of the band had become fathers, and ex-psychology major Hollis, always a bit of an introvert, simply wanted to raise his young children on a farm.     The band's final album was experimental, it would eventually become associated with a new genre, dubbed by critics in the 90's as \\"Post-Rock\\".  Clearly Colour of Spring was a huge step in that direction.      Despite EMI's interest in resigning them, Talk Talk also took the opportunity to depart the label, leading to EMI's release of a greatest hits collection \\"A Natural History\\" in 1999, featuring a number of songs from Colour of Spring.  That album quickly suprised many people by rapidly selling over a million copies.  Colour of spring is an album I have returned to many times over the years, and I consider it one of the best in my vast collection, and one that has that rare quality that seems to transcend the passage of time and fads.  Quite simply, if you bought \\"A Natural History\\" and enjoyed it, then you need to buy this brilliant album, stick it in your CD player and leave it there for a long time.
B000002UAF|5.0|Rank the Beatles albums as you like but in the \\"Stick it on and try to stop singing along with it\\" stakes \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is pretty difficult to beat. Don't believe me... well if you were there at the time get your old album or CD out, and, if you weren't, get hold of a copy and give it a whirl. Result?... by track 2 (\\"I Should Have Known Better\\") you'll be off and then there's no way back from being sucked into it all. <br /> <br />In amongst the huge praise heaped on \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt Pepper\\" & \\"Abbey Road\\" it's easy to forget that the reason the Beatles became so famous was because they could write infectious and unforgettable pop songs. That's what \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is full of and that's why it catapulted them to international stardom. It could so easily have been the difficult \\"we're now so successful we've made a film\\" third album but instead it was a stunning confirmation that they were quite exceptional tunesmiths. It knocked all competition out of the ring and left the world asking \\"what'll they do next?\\" which, of course, is history. <br /> <br />And, after all the years and all that's been said, it's still irresistible. A 20th century classic and, above all, a wonderful slice of \\"good time\\" music. Stick it on and try to stop singing along with it... <br />
B000088E6D|4.0|I was familiar with Michael, but did not realize how much I really enjoyed his talent until purchasing this CD.  He offers a unique perspective, style, and sound in today's pop music culture.
0385507755|4.0|I didn't like the way the author chose to capitalize certain nouns and use no punctuation marks, but you get used to it.  I enjoyed his view of overcoming his many addictions with the help of others, and some good luck.  He gets graphic with drug use and sex stories. <br /> <br />A good read to put yourself in the shoes of an addict and try to understand how bad addiction can be.
B000E5N62U|5.0|I've waited 13 long years for this CD, and I have to say, it's worth the wait. I'm a huge SD/DF fan (I have all the CDs), so naturally, I had to buy Morph the Cat. All of the songs are put together so well; the production's amazing! I like all the tracks, but my favorites are: H Gang, Mary Shut The Garden Door, That's What I Do, Security Joan and Brite Nitegown. Like a fine wine, Donald has aged gracefully; it's a shame that I couldn't see his recent concert in NYC.  <br /> <br />For those who haven't yet, don't hesitate--get this CD today. You won't regret it a bit.
B000001DTM|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the best U2 albums they have released.  The boys from Ireland were definitley hitting their stride when they made Achtung Baby.  This one will stand the test of time...buy it!
B000001FN1|5.0|Warlock is definetly an underrated band! there's so much good stuff on this cd when i heard it I thought this was too good for my ears to hear!! Doro Pesch is one of the best female vocalist ever and she's perfect for metal - specifically the music that she performs. Doro's aggressive yet melodic vocal approach is strong and she can out-aggress (haha?) male vocalists in metal as well. You might also wanna check out her solo band \\"Doro\\" but Warlock was definitely worth their existance while they lasted.
B000E5N62U|4.0|Yes, I too would love to hear another release from Mr. Fagen that equals the nightfly.Until that wonderful day I will just keep buying and listening to all the other great music that he produces as a solo artist and as one half of the incomporable Steely Dan.I think this is a solid effort and equals the last 2 Steely Dan releases in quality if not quantity.So...if I can't have The Nightfly part 2..I'll take this.

B000ASATWQ|5.0|I'm Jamaican and I must admit I hardly buy albums of any kind - far easier to download or have someone burn their copy. A friend burned me a copy and I loved it so much I actually went out and bought my own to show my support and bought another copy for my cousin who too is now hooked!. Bob would be proud to see what Damian has done with this album. Welcome to Jamrock is full of hit songs - I love every single track. My favorites: \\"welcome to Jamrock\\" -nuff said; \\"All Night\\" w/h Stephen Marley; Beautiful w/h Bobby Brown; \\"Move!\\"; \\"For the Babies\\" w/h Stephen and \\"Road to Zion\\" with Nas...the whole album is crazy! and I would recommend it HIGHLY to anyone sitting on the fence! I can guarantee you will not be disappointed - he deserves every award he's won for this album...
B00005AWMF|5.0|Romantic, delightful, passionate, longing, etc.  Sade is the real R&B deal with her unique sound.  Excellent remaster.  If you are breathing, you will have to dance.
B00005JOE8|5.0|Anyone who thinks that there is some sort of moral ambiguity in this movie is completely delusional and semi-brainwashed. Despite all the comparisons to Bush and Cheney that exist in the movie, lets face facts, the regime in this movie was a Nazi style government which is much worse than the Bush Administration, and that takes a lot of hard work and determination. This was no pseudo-democracy, it was outright fascist dictatorship with no civil or political rights. Englishmen have revolted and overthrown kings twice in their history for crimes that pale in comparison to the crimes of the regime in this movie. America was founded in a revolution that is considered glorious, against a regime that was nothing compared to the one in this movie in terms of evil. And yet the absurd debate goes on, should V have done what he did? Is he a freedom fighter or a terrorist? IS V A TERRORIST??? If that is the question you come away with after watching this movie you truly are brainwashed, the question you should come away is how a terrorist regime like the one in the movie could achieve power and sustain itself. They are the real terrorists, not V. Again I ask what else V could have done? Submit or fight are the only options! There comes a point in the most radical regimes where peaceful protest is punished by death, then what? Submission or fighting is the only choice! There was no alterative to what V did except submission. And to those who would say that peaceful measures should have been followed and glorified instead of violent resistance. you are living in a fantasyland. Tanks in China crushed the pro-democracy movement of peaceful protest in, remember? Do you think peaceful protests would have stopped Hitler? If you think V is a terrorist for seeking to overthrow a fascist, racist regime that had killed 100,000 of its own citizens to guarantee its power, and experimented on V himself in twisted fashion, then you must also think that every partisan group that fought the Nazi's in occupied Europe was a terrorist too, that is certainly what the Nazi's said at the time. So therefore if you buy into V being a terrorist, or even if you try to equate V with the government in this movie, instead of seeing that the true terrorists were the fascist regime that started everything to begin with, you are thinking like a Nazi and identifying with the regime instead of with the person resisting the regime. It is not ok to fight against Nazis anymore, to stand up to them? If you stand up to Nazis you are a terrorist? Then the French Resistance was a terrorist organization and the Nazi's were the victims? Or there was some sort of moral equivalency between the Nazi's and the French Resistance just because they both killed one another? Such a contention is patently absurd, the Nazi's started the war and the killing and the only way to stop them was to kill them. V was in the same position in this movie. Sometimes you have to fight, sometimes the evil men have to be killed. We all know this to be true, there can be individual terrorists but there can also be terrorist states, just because a government exists and has power does not automatically give it some sort of moral high ground. Men who felt as V did killed Nazis in World War 2 and the world is better off because of it. That is a fact. Even Bush supporters know that some governments are no good and need to go, and supporting revolutionaries in those countries can be a good thing. What about Sloban Milsoviec? They should not have had a revolution and overthrown him? Complete submission and a total abdication of any willingness to fight is simply a recipe for success for despots like Hitler. America's founding fathers knew this, and it is simple common sense. Sometimes Revolution is necessary, sometimes the government itself is the problem. Coming away from this movie disturbed by V's actions more than you are disturbed by the governments actions shows you have crazy priorities. If you should not rebel against a Nazi style regime that kills its own people, strips them of all rights, experiments on them, then when should you rebel? Apparently never, no matter what. I suppose that there should also be a debate about rather or not V should have blown up the camp where he was being experimented on in order to escape. Obviously V should have just submitted to the medical experiments, blowing up the facility and saving his own life as well as stopping the sick experimentation that was being perpetuated on him was obviously a terrorist act, since the camp was state property, and whatever the state does it is automatically right, all the time, forever, and we should NEVER,NEVER, NEVER, EVER resist, EVER!! Give me a break! V was no terrorist, the true terrorists were the people he got rid of. Not everything can be solved by talk and peaceful protest, that is a lie you are taught to make you submit. Even if you do not agree with me at least ask yourself this question, if V was not right to start a revolution in the circumstances he was in this movie, then when is it right? Is revolution always bad no matter what? How bad does it have to get before resistance is ok? When can you resist, what has to happen to make resistance ok? If we followed the philosophy of those who think is a V a terrorist any semblance of modern democracy as we know would never have existed, it did not just happen, people had to fight for it. People have forgotten this, cowardice and submission to authority does not equal patriotism and virtue. If you do not believe me, find out what the founding fathers or those who fought against Nazism had to say. If they did not fight, injustice and evil would have reigned more supreme than it eventually did anyway. Sometimes violence is necessary and justified, we all know this. WAKE UP!!!!!
B000E6GBV2|5.0|there is an obvious similarity between My Morning Jacket's \\"Z\\" album and The Band of Horses debut.  The albums are similar in so many respects. <br /> <br />However, I find that in terms of overall quality, the Band of Horses is a much better.  The four key tracks \\"Funeral\\", \\"Salt Lake\\", \\"Monsters\\", and \\"weed party\\" are head and shoulders above ALL the songs on the \\"Z\\" album. <br /> <br />anyway, comparison aside, I think the Band of Horses is a great album, one of the best I've heard in a couple of years, its got enough hooks, it has enough artistry, and its brief. <br /> <br />This is a great purchase.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|\\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" is a film where opposites halves become whole.  Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) is a collector, and when his grandmother on her deathbed gives him a photograph of his late grandfather and a woman named Augustine he undertakes a quest back to the Ukraine to find out about this women and his family's past.  His guide in the Ukraine is also the film's narrator, Alex, Jr. (Eugene Hutz), a Ukrainian whose family runs \\"Heritage Tours,\\" where rich American Jews are driven around to find their dead ancestors.  Alex is into Michael Jackson and hip-hop music, and many women want to be carnal with him because of his dancing prowess (did I mention he speaks in your standard comical fractured English?).  Alex Sr. (Boris Leskin) drives the car, although he insists he is blind and treats his \\"seeing eye bitch,\\" a deranged dog found at a home for \\"forgotten dogs\\" and named Sammy Davis, Jr., Jr., better than his grandson.  As for Jonathan, well, he is a stranger in a strange land and he does not eat meat.<br /><br />The idea that the blind are leading the blind in this one is not far removed.  This odd quartet is in search of  Trachimbrod, a hamlet that it seems that nobody has ever heard of.  Jonathan's family is Jewish and his grandfather came to America on the eve of World War II from the Ukraine, so we know what nobody remembers hearing the name of this town.  The first half of this film indulges in the eccentricities of the characters and if you think this is some sort of screwball comedy where east meets west, you would not be far wrong.  But in this 2005 film it is not only that east meets west, but also one where the present collides with the past.  The film's title promises that everything will be revealed in the end, but that is hardly surprising since few films will refuse to divulge their secrets.<br /><br />There is a point in \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" where things stop being funny.  How much you like this film will depend in large part on how accepting you are of this rather radical shift in tone and sentiment.  Certainly we are prepared for the inevitable discovery of the place where a thousand Ukrainian Jews were executed by the Nazis and the flashbacks specific to what happened to the characters.  Such tales are always sobering, and although we have heard countless tales of such horrors there is a sense in which the comic elements of the first half of the movie set up a qualitative shift to the grim stories of the past and the old woman (Laryssa Lauret) who awaits the traveler in a house surrounded by an endless sea of sunflowers.  But this turns out to be a film where such horrors are relating by telling rather than by seeing, which certainly proves to be effective, because the final flashback is reserved for something else for us to see to help complete the tale.<br /><br />Ironically, \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" brings some lyrical aspects to its particular tale of the Holocaust because of Liev Schreiber's artistic sensibilities as a director.  Some might find the introduction of beauty into such scenes to be disconcerting, but I found them rather affirming.  Jonathan meets another \\"collector,\\" and comes to the realization that there is much more to life and to memory than putting things in Ziploc bags.  But in the end it is really the two Alexes, grandfather and grandson, who are on the larger journey of discovery, and they too are forced to realize that their little business is about larger things.  First time writer-director Schreiber has attempted something ambitious, but also tried to keep it on a more intimate and ultimately human level.  I think he succeeds more often than he fails in this effort, which is why I round up on this one (especially after seeing the deleted scenes on the DVD that graphically show how close he was to going too far and destroying the delicate balance on his finished film).ng you are of this rather radical shift in tone and sentiment.

0671027387|5.0|This was my favorite Dan Brown book.  How could NASA possibly fake a meteor with fossils under the Artic ice to ensure their funding sounds impossible.  Dan Brown actually pulls this off as a believable caper.  This book cannot be put down from start to finish.
B000EGDC14|4.0|Alison Goldfrapp is one of those artists worth waiting a few years for, especially if it's for the follow-up to the sexy electropop \\"Black Cherry.\\" And she doesn't disappoint in her third album, the much-anticipated \\"Supernature\\" -- sultry, dancey electropop, with a hint of future experimentation.<br /><br />It opens on a strong note with a trio of sinuous beat-heavy songs -- the fluffier, dancier pop of \\"Ooh La La\\" and the sinuous beats of \\"Lovely 2 C U,\\" although that letter-number thing is a bit too cutesy for my taste. By the time she approaches the heavy, twisting beats and swooning vocals of \\"Ride A White Horse,\\" it's obvious that Goldfrapp has hit her stride.<br /><br />From there on, she experiments a bit with different styles, not content to just sit on the dancier electropop, as many artists would do. She tries out orchestral electropop, ethereal balladry that makes her sound like she's floating away, sizzly synthpop, and delicate dancepop.<br /><br />By the finale, Goldfrapp is poking around in some different sounds as well -- sinuous, complex dancepop that is busy slithering all over the sound board, a classier brand of electropop, and the piece de resistance: \\"Time Out of the World,\\" a string-accented, expansive song that seems content to sweep gently over the listener's ears.<br /><br />If that exquisite song is where Goldfrapp is going with her music, then I'm sure her fans will follow eagerly. Most of the album is in the same mold as \\"Black Cherry,\\" but more refined and mature artistically. And of course, she starts putting out feelers toward new styles.<br /><br />And even if you're not looking for artistic brilliance, Goldfrapp will be fun to listen to -- her ballads are achingly pretty, and her dancepop is the sort of stuff that you can tap your foot to, but not so repetitive that it becomes monotonous. Sultry melodies, rapid beats, and all arranged as actual music. Sometimes Goldfrapp even accentuates the dancepop with smooth soundscapes and strings.<br /><br />The centerpieces is, of course, Goldfrapp's singing. Her sweet voice weaves in and out of the beats -- sometimes she's front and center, sometimes she's darting behind the sound. Want a downside to all this? Okay, the lyrics are not exactly brilliant (\\"When the light turns into darkness/Will he turn up to explain us?/I wanna ride on a white horse...\\").<br /><br />And the deluxe version is well-worth getting; no measly featurettes or random B-sides here! It includes her sultry, otherworldly music videos, a solid live performance, a behind-the-scenes look at Goldfrapp's work (warts and all), and other stuff like a picture gallery. It's a great addition, especially since the extra DVD costs very little.<br /><br />\\"Supernature\\" is not supernatural, but it is a delightful electropop album, and gives a few glimpses of where Goldfrapp may be heading in the future.

B0008KLVG4|3.0|Jaws was the film that change the movie industry.  Summer was always thought of as a waste land for the movie industry.  No films of substance were released during the summer because no one went to the films during the summer because they were on vacation.  That is until Jaws came through and broke Sound of Music boxoffice record.    That is the importance of Jaws, not that it is a great film. Everyone knows the story.  Big shark terrorizes little beach resort but the big wigs don't want to cancel the big holiday event.    Spielberg is a technical director.  He is best at scenes that do not involve words and emotion.  He is best at minipulating the audience through camera angles, editing and music.  But when it comes to the acting, these scenes are only as good as the actors in it.  And in this we have the great Robert Shaw who steals the movie as the rustic shark hunter.  The rest of the actors flounder in the mediocrity of the script.    You might ask why am I writing this review, it was on my recomended by Amazon list and I am just warning people like me that it would be better to invest in Alfred Hitchcock films than this.    With that said, this is a film to watch when you want something mindless.  This is not a film classic but a fun classic.
B00003CX9S|4.0|There have been many films made dealing with an individual who's outer appearance is completely at odds with their inner character. Some of these films are quite good but this is by far and away the very best. This is probably one of the most perfect films ever made. It succeeds on every level. Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world. It's within this world that we come to discover true beauty. It lies within one hideously deformed, abused and unfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence. The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The ending is one of the most effective and completely engrossing I've ever seen. Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world. I can still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over the audience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the big screen. There's a transforming quality about it. You only need to read the many other user comments to see how people were moved and changed by this film. If you haven't seen it, it's a must!
0060595183|4.0|Huxley's `experiment' in The Doors of Perception was a right of passage for many in my generation, and it's interesting to have such an intelligent analysis of the experience.  He does waste a lot of words on something that is indescribable, but it seems to have been written in the first blush of excitement.  And Huxley makes some very sound observations, as well, that have probably helped many people reconcile their own indescribable experiences.<br /><br />His conclusion that Mescalin and Lysergic Acid are relatively harmless for people in good health with an untroubled mind is probably objectionable today, especially among people who have never tried them.  Looked at objectively, however, I wonder how this conclusion has stood the test of time.  For myself, I believe he underestimated the long-term psychological challenges that cleansing those doors poses.<br /><br />I remember something I read long ago from Philip K. Dick saying how difficult life is after you've seen God's face.  The realization afterwards that you'd been forced back to a colorless, banal existence - a prison, if I recall the sense of what Dick wrote - must surely be considered one of the long-term psychological challenges that Huxley could not have fully appreciated when he wrote this book.<br /><br />The feeling of being a prisoner in the normal world of perceptions might conceivably result in a hunger to return often to that `Antipodes of the mind' which, if felt too keenly, could cause permanent damage to be done to the mind's function as a `limiting valve.'  This suggests to me that blaming acid casualties on a `troubled mind' may not be wholly satisfactory: some people choose to pack up their belongings and move to an island in Huxley's Antipodes, and these people can't always continue to function in the society their bodies continue to inhabit.<br /><br />But the situation is complex: whether these `immigrants to the Antipodes' can continue to cope in the normal world is surely also a function of the society they live in. An American Indian tribe in the 1800's or Amsterdam today probably offer the mental &eacute;migr&eacute; more of a chance for social survival than Riyadh, for example.  One of the strengths of this book is to provide a good line of reasoning that explains why this might be true.<br /><br />Heaven and Hell follows the extended, and appropriate, Blake reference.  But to me this essay feels more like a long article you'd find in a magazine written by a cocky critic.  Sure, there's much erudition on display and many valid aesthetic points are made; but the spirit behind it feels naïve: like many of the new ideas and associations that had formed in his mind hadn't had a chance to mellow and mature.<br /><br />On the other hand, what seem like random observations to me may form a pattern I just didn't pick up on.

B000A88EVE|4.0|As a big fan of Roeg, Bowie, and sci-fi in general, I was intrigued enough to purchase the new Criterion edition as a blind buy (also aided in my decision by some positive reviews from friends whose opinion I trust). Overall, I think it was a great decision, if a bit pricey. <br /> <br />David Bowie stars Thomas Jerome Newton, who we first see stumbling around disoriented on earth. He is a technical genius and privately arranges to meet with one Oliver Farnsworth - with a scientific breakthrough and a lofty business plan in mind. Farnsworth quickly becomes his company manager and begins amassing wealth for Thomas, who wants to become rich for reasons known only to him. Another scientist, Nathan Bryce, is also commissioned to be part of the research and development - this time for a space project. Around the same time Thomas meets a young and naive girl, Mary Lou, who helps save his life and cares for him (and eventually becomes his lover, despite Thomas having a wife). While all of this is going on, a rival corporation has noticed Newton's success and is keen to bring his empire of technology down. Of course, in a film like this, none of that matters at all. <br /> <br />That's because Thomas is [i]presumably[/i] an alien who has come to earth in order to save his small desert planet and his family, who appear to be the only survivors after two successive nuclear wars have wrecked havoc on the planet's atmosphere. I say \\"presumably\\" because, despite obvious (the scene with his eyes, I will say no more) and subtle (his constant need of water, his reactions to moving at a fast speed) visual and performance/dialogue clues, the film ends rather ambiguously on this crucial point. In my mind, the possible layer of Newton not being an alien at all is rather fascinating. However, if taken on the surface only, Nicolas Roeg has concocted a visually and sonically impressive sci-fi classic, with a fine and appropriate misanthropic and moody performance by David Bowie. <br /> <br />Roeg takes his time to develop the story around the loose framework of the novel but uses a number of interesting visuals and abstract imagery/metaphor in order to convey his major themes - the loneliness and the vices of man, the ruthlessness of the corporate and commercial world, the way we would potentially react to such a visitor (with malice). The other major theme, of course, is sexuality and the power of sex to destroy; Bryce is considered a problem because of his taste for very young women, and Newton's fateful encounter with Mary Lou, however in control he may appear to be at first, ends up doing the same as she introduces him to the joys and follies of human sexuality and also alcohol (which screws with his system and causes hallucinations - much like real life for us humans, eh?). <br /> <br />The film is not without flaws. There are a number of bizarre dialogue exchanges, especially between Newton and Mary Lou, that do nothing to enhance the plot or the development of either character. One particularly fascinating but pretentious sex scene, using a gun and a lot of firing blanks as a sexual allegory, goes on forever and is utterly pointless and without context in that stage of the film. Strange and disturbing visual cues abound and some are particularly effective, but the frequent use of naked bodies writhing around in some kind of oatmeal throughout the film is silly. And not nearly enough time is spent on the reasons and motivations of how exactly Newton intends to save his planet. <br /> <br />Still, a straightforward linear film would have been far less compelling and is not what Roeg intended to make anyway. It is said by the writer in an accompanying interview that Roeg let the spirit of the book guide his choices, and to a large extent that is true; he does remain faithful to the [i]spirit[/i] of the narrative and does not deviate from the central plot. And his distinct visual sense is astonishing to behold for those unfamiliar with his work.However, the grade of the film dips slightly because of the flaws outlined above with regard to pacing, structure, and story. Despite all that, I'm glad I bought it and will look forward to seeing it again with the commentary in order to absorb all the details I missed the first time. An excellent but difficult and challenging piece of science fiction from a visionary director - It's amazing to think that \\"Star Wars\\" was only a year away....
6304806442|3.0|THis was a very unpleasant film to watch: the lives of young Scottish men wasted because of heroine and drug addiction.  They live in grimy quarters, sink to the lowest levels of degradation, crime and violence to keep their addictions going, sell out their families, their friends, themselves..all in the name of getting more drugs.  Can't say I'd recommend it to anyone (especially don't watch it while you're eating dinner) but McGregor and his fellow cast mates do a fine job of portraying these lost souls.
B000002HMH|1.0|After the black album tour, Metallica got major success and it went to their heads.  They became bonafide rockstars.     Since then everything they have released is pure garbage.  This album sucks so bad that I cannot express the intensity at which it sucks.  They've just about made it obvious that all that matters now is money.  To say this album is sub par would be an understatement.  When I saw the video for the 1st single I just about had a heart attack.  What the hell made these guys turn into such wusses?  After this album came out, I realized the Metallica I grew up with was dead and that gems such as Master and Lightning no longer meant anything to these jerks.  I've sold every Metallica CD, boxset and T shirt that I own b/c I don't want anyone to think I support these jacka****.  This is the first band that, as an adult, I truly grew out of.  Thanks guys, that was a true learning experience!  Oh, by the way Lars, sue any fans lately?  There's a reason there's so many used and new copies available.  If you want this album, you better buy it out right and not download it b/c Lars is watching you on his computer!
B0007GAEGC|4.0|Celtic Woman is a great album. I have had my sights on it for some time.  I finally broke down and bought it. I have to admit that after a few listens, and after watching the PBS special, it grew on me.  The CD has now grown to the point where it is all I am listening to right now. I feel like a new world of music has been opened to me. I can not get enough of this performance.  What I was not aware of is that there was a violinist named Mairead. Mairead is a master violinist and I found myself listening to the songs on the CD where she played. Mairead is not only a joy to listen to, she is a joy to watch as well.  She moves on stage with such grace, and you can see that she loves playing the violin in the way she moves about the stage.  She is electric to watch and nothing but a master entertainer.  She stole the show in my opinion.   Meav has a beautiful Soprano voice and sings several songs worth listening to. Meav has a pure voice and has a stage presence that very few have. Orla does an outstanding arrangement of Isle of Innisfree. Lisa is a polished performer and is outstanding. Lisa of couse did songs from the soundtrack of Lord of the Rings and sings two songs from that movie on this record. Chloe has a very nice voice as well. They not only sing great solos, but on a few songs demonstrate some great Celtic harmony. There is something here for all listeners. This Cd will absolutely haunt you as it has done to me. I am going to have to break down and buy the DVD and watch the concert as well.  Lets hope there is another album by these artists.  If not they all have great solo albums......Enjoy
B00000FCBC|1.0|Wow.  Thanks Metallica for putting out a double disc of music that you had already released with the addition of some cover songs.  Bands that put out albums of other people's music may as well write \\"we are no longer able to put out good material of our own so here's some stuff you've already heard by bands that are better than us\\" in the liner notes.  This just goes to show that the $ hungry Metallica machine is devoid of all creativity and will put out ANYTHING for their blind sheep fans to waste their money on.  I'd like to take this CD and cram it down Ulrich's throat.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|I had high hopes that this will be an intelligent movie and it was. The movie has the style of an old 70s classic bank robber movie. You can tell that's what Spike Lee was going for with some references in the movie to past films.<br /><br />The story was well-told and very believable. There was no wild stunts performed, this is not an action thriller more of a crime drama. Though there was some surprisely funny moments in the film that might have seemed out of place, but it does lightened the tension, which is ok since its a drama. I don't have to tell you how the acting is considering the cast. Denzel Washington has his charm, Clive Owen is calm and cool bank robber, Jodie Foster could have been left out (not really necessary), William Dafoe is a believable NYPD captain (not arrogant). The characters acted like real people, there was no arguments between groups and it was refreshing.<br /><br />Finally a real intelligent crime movie that I haven't seen since Heat (another movie about smart cops and robbers).
B0000BYM3K|5.0|What an amazing piece of work!  Since Bruce and Adrian came back into the fold every album since Brave New World has been nothing short of phenominal.  The pieces are so epic.  If I was marching out into war I would use this as the soundtrack. I've been a fan since the first album and we all know how much the old stuff rocks, but this is how a band is supposed to evolve.  They've done it the right way.  It's quite refreshing for a band who has been around this long to get me excited about their new releases.  They haven't done a total out in left field change as far as progressing goes like so many other bands.  The songs are complex and progressive.  Bands like Metallica could learn a lesson from these guys.  Just because a band has been aroung for 20+ years doesn't give them an excuse to put out material that sucks.  Up the Irons!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Beatles 1 is a terrific single disc collection from one of the greatest bands in history.Here you get 27 of the greatest songs ever written and recorded.I only felt that this would have been complete with the inclusion of ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00002Z88D|1.0|Metallica with a symphony? Cliff must be turning over in his grave.  I remeber when this band was raw and heavy.  It seems Metallica keeps coming up w/ more and more ideas to cover up the fact that they can't can't make great music anymore.  Yes, I'm sure anything sounds great when you have a orchestra of highly skilled REAL musicians backing you.  I wasn't fooled by this effort by Metallica to get my money.  This band hasn't evolved the right way.  They've turned into a group of pansies.  I wish I could use a more vulgar term for them. And, oh yeah, don't download this music illegally or Lars will sue you.  A band that sues its own fans!  These guys should hang it up because the well ran dry a long time ago.
B00009P1O0|4.0|The first time I heard about ON THE BEACH was from a review <br />in Rolling Stone Magazine in '74. I was going to school in the mountains, life was good and after perusing the review, it was time for a Neil album. On the way I kept thinking of that line, \\" I'm just pissin' in the wind. \\" That was quite awhile ago, but I've always liked that line and its very idea, of course, pervades most of the album.  Well folks, 32 years later with the good times and bad, the line sounds as good now as it did then.  I put this on right after CAPTAIN BEYOND's first side ended; strange choice, yes, but it was my wish that it be done and it <br />worked pretty well for those of you familiar with CB.  It adds <br />an interesting perspective to the seemingly endless questions <br />we face as we move through this life.  The CAPTAIN was more <br />fun but ON THE BEACH fed my head.
B000002HRE|1.0|Just when you think Metallica couldn't find a new way to cover up how much they suck, they do.  Let's see; put out a double disc of covers and something that was already released, then we could have a symphony behind us, then we could jump on the Alternative band wagon. What can we do now?  Lets release the crap that wasn't good enough to put on our last album!  Yeah! Our fans will put out money on anything that falls out of our back end!  This is why I stopped being a fan a long time ago and have since sold everything I owned that was Metallica.  It's sad when all a band wants to do is make money and not care about the product they put before the fans.  I wasn't fooled by this.  After the black album, they should've quit because what made this a great band left a long time ago.
B000009QO6|5.0|I've always been a fan of The Misfits, and I never heard this band until recently. I heard the song \\"Mother\\" about a year ago when I was at my friends house and he was playing Grand Theft Auto. I was sitting there and I heard the song, and I was that sounds like Glenn Danzig, so I went home and downloaded the song, Then later I went out and bought it. Now it's one of my favorite albums of all time. I strongly recommend it to anyone.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I've read the negative reviews about this CD.  If you don't think this is one of their best works you are NOT a Maiden fan.  Go listen to No Doubt or something.  Anyway, the complexity of this CD is awesome.  It's another Maiden album you can listen to front to back b/c all of the songs are great.  I can't stand these people who say that only the old stuff is good.  I've been a Maiden fan since the 1st album.  I also was able to see them live in support of this album.  The songs come across even better live.  This is how a band is supposed to evolve.  Beast and Piece of Mind are great albums, but Maiden knows its fan don't want to hear the same thing album after album.  If you want to hear a band that doesn't care about its fans and continues to put out garbage material just for the sake of a dollar, then I suggest you go pick up everything Metallica has put out since the black album.

B0000074NU|5.0|UFO, while practically unheard of in America, were gigantic in Europe during the mid 70's to early 80's. When someone mentions hardrock from this time period, most people will talk your ear off about Led Zepplin, Deep Purple, Rush, Van Halen, Ted Nugent, Black Sabbath and other high-profile, mainstream rock bands people went ga-ga over. You won't, however, hear much or anything at all about UFO, a band from the U.K. that had a certain ace-kraut guitarist and a heavy drinking lead singer, especially in this country. Too bad, because UFO has all of those aformentioned bands collectivly beat IMHO. UFO:Gold is probably the single best disc you can own from this band, if you can only own one at all. Other then *Force It*, thier albums had their share of filler material to go along with the \\"hits\\", so this solves that problem. Also, unlike *Essentilal*, this covers the underrated Paul Chapman-era. <br /> <br />This CD covers all the albums from 74' (Phenomenon) to 85' (Misdemeanor).

B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is truly one of the greatest movies of all time.  I wasn't too much of a fan of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's other endeavors such as The City of Lost Children.  Frankly, they are just TOO strange.  However, something that is apparent from the first moment of any film that Jeunet has directed is his incredible imaginative vision.  He sees entire universes within the smallest actions.  He sees fate and destiny in funny coincidences.  As you will find if you watch the special feautures, much of Amelie is inspired by childhood events that actually occurred in his life or those of friends.  I believe it is this element of true nostalgia that all of the fans of Amelie relate to.  His experiences ring true in the hearts of all.  This is where the beauty of Amelie arises.  His memories and experiences, combined with his sense of color and the way to highlight a scene, not to mention an incredible cast and one of the best film scores of all time composed by Yann Tiersen...all together they form something never before seen in the medium of film.
B00005JOUM|4.0|Denzel Washington is really, really good in this film. It is one of his best performances in a long while. Clive Owen is good as usual and Jodie Foster makes the most out of her small role. Inside Man also boasts a clever story with realistic dialogue (you won't get any Tarantino lines here), some of which had the theater laughing in a good way. The twist was unique, but it wasn't that mind blowing. I don't regret spending $7.00 and two and a half hours of my day on this film. This is one of the few Spike Lee films that I enjoyed from beginning to end.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|Serenity satisfactorily answers some lingering questions from the too-soon-aborted Firefly television series, leaves a few more hanging and perhaps even opens up a few for future projects.<br /><br />It's also, for those who didn't see the series, either on television or on DVD, a grungy, lived-in universe like the Aliens universe, but one where the greatest threat is humanity.<br /><br />Some of the quirks of the TV series have been toned down: It's not quite so blatantly a post-Civil War Western in space, and some of the cutesier character bits have been relegated to the deleted scenes portion of the DVD. The film will be most enjoyable for those who have seen the series, but it's still fun for those who haven't.<br /><br />It also has a stronger narrative through-line than the often leisurely television episodes, better special effects and make-up and even better writing. (The dialogue has more of a future-archaic feel which adds a great deal of realism to the proceedings.)<br /><br />Bring on the next sequel!<br /><br />Strongly recommended for fans of Firefly and anyone who loved Han Solo back when he shot first.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is a drifter, Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is looking for work. The opening sequence of the film signifies a beginning of these mens fate. Ennis and Jack are both at a trailer office of a herder, looking for work for a few months, just enough money to get by, but what unfolds from this fateful meeting is a relationship that effects these two men's lives until the day they die. <br /> <br />When it comes down to it, Brokeback Mountain is a love story, yet what sets is apart from any other romance is the fact that these two cowboys happen to both be men. While on a job watching a sheep herd, Ennis and Jack become more then just coworkers. On their first encounter, the sexual experience seems completely lustful and animalistic. There are no words, just pure unadulterated lust. By the second encounter with these two men, you can see a change. These men are no longer just trying to get through the boredom of a lonely night, these men are in love. The contact is more emotional and sensual. Under normal circumstances, contact such as this between two men would make me queasy. But the way that director Ang Lee goes about it, leads to not nausea, but a genuine care for the characters. While watching, you don't look at these two men as homosexuals. You look at them as two men in love. Just two souls on the same line of fate that matched each other perfect. The end of the movie comes in a rush and moves along to quickly to hold any real emotion, which is my only qualm with the film as a whole. <br /> <br />Heath Ledger as Ennis is amazingly well-cast. He is living the character rather then playing the character. His emotions are genuine and his gestures are natural. Jake Gyllenhaal also does a decent job of holding up his role as Jack Twist, but there are moments during his performance where it seems that he has not matured enough as an actor to hold such a role. <br /> <br />His character seems annoyingly static, while it should be dynamic. Anne Hathaway as Laureen Newsome, Jack's wife, is ravishing as usual. Her beauty is persevered even as the years pass in the story and the times change. <br /> <br />The script adaptation of the novel is transcribed very well from the pages to the big screen. Director Ang Lee does a consistently good job through out the film. The element that captures the touches of Ang Lee are the little things. Such as Ennis' daughter becoming a lot like her father, described as \\"not saying much but getting her point across\\". Ang Lee also does a stellar job of showing both mens point of views throughout the movie. <br /> <br />So when all has been said and done, this was not a story about a homosexual relationship, but a tale of true love. Two souls bound for each other that seems not as much taboo as it does unfair. These men are stuck in their love, and are stuck in their on lives. But it just goes to show, love never dies. It only gets put on hold for a while. <br /> <br />4/5

B000E8N690|5.0|OK...you caught me. I'm a Johnny Cash fan and this review may be biased. So shoot me. But thankfully enough no bias is needed to enjoy this film. The story of Johnny Cash is one of inspiration and perseverance. Walk The Line documents Johnny Cash's life from early childhood (with the death of his brother, Jack) to the time he proposes to June Carter on stage, even though she had refused him so many time already up to that point. It's a rag to riches story and in inspirational picture that shows as long as you have passion for something, then anything is possible. <br /> <br />From his childhood wordplay, to his buying of his first guitar while he was away in the army in Germany, through his audition for a little label called Sun Records, to the point where he first sees the woman he has been waiting for all of his life, this movie delivers on every aspect. The script is solid and well-written for each role. The dialog and actions are true to life form for the body language and slang of the time. The recreation of the various venues and concerts are realistic and natural. James Mangold has created, by far, his best film. <br /> <br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have something that is rarely found in cinema. They have acting chemistry. Both of them perform practically without flaw. Reese looks absolutely adorable with the dark-brown hair of June Carter, and has no problem playing her sassy, silly, and caring personality. In various moments of the film. Joaquin Phoenix resembles Johnny Cash to an eerie level of realism. In fact, not only Reese and Joaquin did a great job, but the whole cast from supporting roles to extras did a fantastic job. Though Joaquin Phoenix could have easily won the Oscar for best actor instead of Heath Ledger. <br /> <br />One of my favorite parts of the film are the music scenes. The performances are not dubbed over by the actual voices of Johnny Cash and June Carter, but redone by the respected actors. It gives the film a taste ofuniqueness and creativity. Surprisingly, both Phoenix and Witherspoon have a wonderful voice, and Phoenix had to learn the guitar from scratch for the role. To tell you the truth, I prefer Reese Witherspoon's voice compared to some of June Carter's work. Another element of the film that stood out was the editing. Done through music montages and split-screen progressions, the time spans that pass in this movie are done so in a way that let's the audience know what is going on in that period, but also not leaving the character in the dark about the present. <br /> <br />Walk The Line is the best film of the year. Simple as that. The acting and directing carry this movie to the far reaches of the heart. Even though the camera work is nothing out of the ordinary, all of the other aspects are enough to keep the film afloat. This film truly drawls the audiences compassion and care for Johnny and his ever dieing devotion to the sassy June Carter. Johnny Cash may have not been the most handsome man or the most courageous, but what he lacks physically is made up for with one of the strongest hearts in all of music and a soul that sings to all of humanity. <br /> <br />4.5/5
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|The true test of a movie, even a bizarre film, is will they keep watching? Well, I did, and it wasn't all that bad. Some parts were 'over the top corny', but the singing was great and Johnny Depp is always pushing himself to bring out the best, no matter what role he's given. As far as I'm concerned, Depp is one of the top most talented performers on the screen today.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B00005JO04|3.0|When an audience member goes to a theater to watch a movie,they are interested in viewing a film that will expand their mind, make them laugh, or to draw some sort of emotional reaction. Not a movie that requires them to know the ins and outs of the Middle East 's political relationships with the U.S. That's not what people want...but that's what they are going to get with Syriana. <br /> <br />Syriana is basically a somewhat comprehensive look at the inner workings of the corruption and relationships that live within the relations of the Middle East and America concerning Energy/Oil. I say somewhat because the movie does a pretty crappy job displaying any true meaning or agenda. There are far too many characters and far to many plot lines going on at once, which seemed at some points to be reaching for a goal that it just couldn't reach. With almost no character development and no background information, the script comes up far short of my expectations. <br /> <br />As far as the acting goes, George Clooney was by far the standout actor in a main role. His newly bearded mug and pudgy gut was proof that there are some actors willing to still make sacrifices for a role that they care about. Matt Damon, on the other hand, was not even working at a moderately believable rate. Damon seemed so uninterested and and uncomfortable in his role, that it made me feel both uninterested and uncomfortable with his role. One actor I was truly impressed with though was Alexander Siddig, who plays Prince Nasir Al-Subaai, which turns out to be a pretty minor character. Even with his lack of screen time I consider him to have acted the best role of the cast. <br /> <br />My favorite aspect of the film would have to be the cinematography. It's not even that the camera work is that spectacular. It's the fact that everything else about the film had such complex nuances and unspoken reasonings, that the camera work was the only solid piece of understandable styling. The climax of the filmcomes considerably late in the movie, but by that time, because of the utter emotional detachment that the script emits, there is really no feelings towards the characters. Everyone is a antagonist in their own way in this film, which makes it pretty hard to truly care about anyones well-being. <br /> <br />I believe that there is a good movie buried somewhere within the ideas of Syriana. The saddest moment about this movie is the moment you realize of how ground-breaking a film of this theme could have been. I guess when you think about it, any film can be turned into something better. It's just a matter of putting a certain amount of emotional interest in the movie. Syriana was not directed write, or acted write, or even written right, but the potential is still there. George Clooney may of won the Oscar Award for best supporting actor for his role, but I still think Paul Giamatti was robbed. <br /> <br />3.25/5

1400062071|1.0|After reading the accolades about Amy and Isabelle, I was truly looking forward to reading Abide with Me.  But I can honestly say that it is the worst book that I have read in years.  Here I was hoping that perhaps it was a Jodi Picoult or a Sue Miller....but it ended up being a hard-covered Harlequin Romance.  The story was shoddy...it was written for someone in a nursing home.  The best page was the last page.  Thank god....I am done the book.  Definitely do not recommend...except for someone born in 1920.

B00008EY5W|5.0|Been buying DVDs since they have been released and have noticed how little I watch the extras - thus releasing DVDs such as this whereby all extras are omitted and the free disk space is used to better sound and picture quality makes it very appealing to me. <br /> <br />The film is very tongue-in-cheek but its the action and special effects that make this film very watchable.  Picture and sound quality are near on perfect and are a real testiment to what DVD can produce - cant wait for High Definition

It was not really worth the price.  Noted only a few things in the book which prompted me to want to visit or look further into them, like the abuse of the Aboriginals.  Otherwise, prettty much a waste of time.  My wife decided to give up on the book and didn't even finish it.
0140157352|5.0|This books is an excellent introduction to negotiation.  It talks about negotiating in a principled way, but not in a weak way.  When I was a director in business, I bought a copy for all of my managers and challenged them to operate this way.  The advice is practical, the ideas well presented and the model something that has proven itself over time.<br /><br />While the concepts are simple, the application isn't.  It takes awareness and emotional intelligence to do all of the things in this book well.  However, the book raises awareness of what's really critical and in that sense it is invaluable.  This is a business classic for good reason.<br /><br />I think the most important thing this book emphasizes is separating out the emotional factors from the substance of the negotation  and working with them separately.  While this may seem like common sense, a lot of people go forward with a negotiation without getting the emotional issues on the table and resolved first.<br /><br />I also found this book hard-hitting.  There was a lot of good, well-organized information in a short space.  If you don't want to become an expert at negotiation, but you are looking for something short with solid principles, this is your book.  If you are looking for books on conflict resolution, there are better ones out there.  If you click on my profile, I list some of them under a listmania list and have written reviews under each one.  Perhaps one of these books would be better for your specific needs.<br /><br />I think it is useful to master the principles in this book so they can function as a roadmap to hang more complicated ideas on as your skills grow in this area.  While the book doesn't address some of the more difficult or complicated areas of negotiation, it is a great concise introduction that will point you in the right direction for the challenges you are facing.<br /><br />I also like the strong emphasis on ethics in this book.  I think it's a misconception that one needs to compromise principles to be a tough negotiator.  This is certainly not true and this is a great book for people who don't want to win a particular negotiation at the expense of an important relationship.  Therefore, it's also a nice roadmap for couple's, dealing with teenagers, etc.h negotiator.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I was a fan of the theatrical release that came out about a year ago.  After viewing this version, i went back the the original release and found that it doesn't even compare.  This version is absolutely amazing.  If this version were released instead of the original I believe that it would have definitely been an Oscar contender.  This version is movie-making at its finest!
B000E5N62U|4.0|First off... the hooks involved on this CD are quite possible the kinds of hooks that we might hear on the next SD CD.  This is a very funny CD.. The song MTC is very humerous and it is quite fun to listen to the lyrics on the whole CD...<br /><br />I can't explain why, but the song 'H GANG' sticks in my head.. a very good song that really stands high on this outing.<br /><br />I would say that every song on this CD is pretty darn good.  The only song that I find myself hitting the foward button on is the song BRIGHTNIGHTGOWN. That is only because it is a tad too long.  The chorus is repeated like 60 times at the end of the song... good song except the last two minutes or so....<br /><br />But if that was the only complaint, it was ONLY that little quibble that kept it from being a 5 star CD.<br /><br />There is a sense of foreboding on the release... and it may come from the fact that DF is getting older, but it is not a foreboding that one might find on a release of someone who might be giving up... it is more like a feeling of someone who is aware of mortality.  Refreshing... a lot of boomer age folks are writing like this (Bob Dylan, Springsteen, even the new David Gilmour ON AN ISLAND is like this) but it is a good thing to be aware of where you are and what you feel.  Even at the end of the ballgame.<br /><br />Good CD, if you like Steely, you will like this.<br /><br />Have fun.
0060935464|5.0|One of the most unforgettable stories of all time, To Kill A Mockingbird becomes a landmark novel in American literature since its publication in 1960. It is a novel of a lawyer, Atticus, in the deep south defending a black man Tom Robinson charged with the rape of a white girl. Nine-years-old Jean Louise Atticus, from whom her father always shelters and whom neighbors often deems too young to understand the racial struggle, narrates the story. She does it with a stark manner and equanimity of an adult who is savvy of the law. Her perspective is unbridled of the biased and disapproving voices of the town, of which nobody does even one thing to help Tom Robinson, let alone risking one's own life to defend a black man who in the secret courts of men's hearts have no case. That simply being a black yields a disadvantage in the jury's deliberation let alone a black man who is allegedly convicted of an act of felony against a white person. Tom Robinson is dead as the girl opens her mouth and rains charges on him. <br /> <br />A child's narration cuts to the core of hypocrisy: some of the most religious people turn their blind eye to an innocent black man who in the absence of any corroborative evidence is indicted on a capital charge and is on the trial of his life. Jean Louise's voice of the narrative might be hesitant, dubious, and questioning, she packs the novel with intimate voice of conversation, of people living and sorting out their lives and the whole racial entangle. Atticus therefore bears a formidable task to not only defend Tom Robinson but also to rebuff, with a righteous indignation, the inveterate discrimination against the blacks. He thrives to protect the children from absorbing the human ugliness: Why can't people get along with each other? Who do people get out of their way to despise one another? What really scares me is such racial labeling still exists now but in a subtler manner that no longer makes people feel broken. In the recent Katrina news coverage, the media labeled a black woman who waded through the hip-deep water hurling supplies out of a store a looter. Racial labeling pervades people like babies born with basic instincts: it renders a stereotype that is culpable of perception that is laden with judgment. <br /> <br />Atticus knows that Tom Robinson's case, though it is as simple as black and white that it should never have come to trial, is something that dives right into the essence of a man's conscience. Conscience is the one thing that does not abide by the majority rule. It transcends all racial difference and confronts the intimacy of one's heart. That is the reason he wishes his children to embrace some \\"ugly things\\" that are concomitant of his defending a black man - for all he does is to abide by his conscience and to come clear of it. It is never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name, especially when one is defending a good cause against mendacious testimony. It just shows how poor and piteous people are when they with maddening superiority thrive to label and call name at others. <br /> <br />To Kill A Mockingbird vehemently condemns those who recklessly bend the law at the expense of the innocent's life for the satisfaction of one's supremacy. It also satirizes self-righteous people who rave madly when anything involving a black person occurs. Every page of the novel reminds us that the fight for equality is yet over: it radiates a wave of racial tension and menacing undertow of conflict. <br />
0790734850|5.0|There isn't much else for me to say that already hasn't been said.  L.A. Confidential is a modern noir masterpiece.  The performances by Pearce, Crowe and Spacey are pitch-perfect.  Basinger's tragic tale earned her a well-deserved Oscar.  If anything, this film's loss of the Best Picture Oscar to the sickeningly overrated Titanic was vindicated in the following years.  Kevin Spacey would win an Oscar for American Beauty in 1999 and Crowe would win his in 2000's Gladiator.  I've heard this compared to Chinatown and while that movie is another classic, I find L.A. Confidential to be a much more compelling viewing experience.  Chinatown was more or less Jack Nicholson's movie and no one else's.  L.A. Confidential has such an outstanding ensemble cast that you'll find yourself rooting for them all, every single corrupt and twisted one of them.  If this movie isn't in your collection it should be, whether you're a film noir fan or not.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|This was almost entirely an impulse purchase for me, after being thoroughly impressed by System's performance on \\"Steal This Album!\\" However, \\"Mesmerize\\" is a very, very different piece of work from the aforementioned album. <br /> <br />I'm all for progressive rock music, don't get me wrong there. Innovation and originality are great, the more we see from them the better. But on \\"Mesmerize,\\" System Of A Down quite frequently border on the line between \\"innovative\\" and inconsistent.\\" The many, many short, quirky moments on the various songs (and there are many) seem to have very little interrelation. Variety is good and all, but these songs could very well have all been played by different bands. I often found myself longing for more straight-down-the-middle heavy riffage and screaming, like on \\"Steal This Album!\\" Not that I want generic, unimaginative music, but it would be effective in tying this album togather more effectively. As things are, it all seems a bit... messy. <br /> <br />That being said, \\"Mesmerize\\" does have its merits. The riffs on offer here are strongly catchy, and the variety between songs _will_ keep you involved straight to the end. The main appeal in this album for me however, lies in moments like the chorus of \\"Sad Statue,\\" which seem to me to hint at genuine soul and emotion. It's not often that music like that makes it through to the mainstream. <br /> <br />Overall then, I'd say \\"Mesmerize\\" is worth checking out if you want something a little less straightforward. However, if System want their music to be taken more seriously, they'll have to add a bit of consistency, and find their niche in music. As it is, I listen to In Flames for catchy melodies, Napalm Death for pure anarchaic chaos and Agalloch for innovation and originality. And until System can become truly exceptional in one of those categories, those are the bands I'm sticking with.
B000E33VWW|5.0|...Seymour Hoffman that is, this man truly deserved his Oscar.  I've long admired his fine acting, reminds me of Paul Giametti who's another immensely talented yet not terribly well-publicized actor because he isn't very photogenic and would hardly qualify for male-bimbo status like a Tom Cruise nor does he have the generic \\"all-American\\" mainstream appeal of a Harrison Ford or Kevin Costner.  Both excel at playing slightly (or not so slightly) unhinged characters.<br /><br />In this film, Hoffman does a phenomenal job on Truman Capote---especially in the scene just before the execution at the end of the film.  His face just flows so effortlessly from one emotion and mood to the next, expresses a combination of conflicting emotions perfectly.<br /><br />Catherine Keener is another highly talented and under-recognized actress who shines in this film, here she actually plays a relatively normal straight-laced woman for a change rather than her usual shrewish characters.  Chris Cooper and Clifford Collins round out the flawless cast.  The cinematography and editing are done well---this film like Capote's writing has a both spare/austere and sensuous quality which keeps your attention riveted.  Very fast 2 hours.<br /><br />Best of all is the lack of any sugarcoating on the simple fact that for Capote to get the story that he wanted to write, he had to bribe, manipulate, and lie between his teeth to his subject.  There is also no sugarcoating the fact that aside from being a ruthless journalist in doing his job, Capote was also a classic self-absorbed narcissist driven by a hunger for recognition and fame.  All the same, like his novel's portrayal of these Kansas killers, Capote is shown to be neither a devil nor a saint but simply what he is---human.  Therein lies the film's genius.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Some friends and I saw commercials for this show and the gist of it was that it was a show based on cowboys in outer space.    We thought this show was going to be a train wreck.  So, of course we had to watch it.  Everyone sat around the TV with their margaritas and readied themselves for a show so horrible it was funny... That didn't happen.  We all fell in love with this show upon first viewing.  The characters were all so familiar yet fresh, and the actors weren`t acting they were their characters.  The dialogue was witty, and the stories were intriguing.  Cowboys in outer space?  Well of course!  This Sci-Fi show was actually more realistic than most.  There aren't any blue-skinned aliens or big blob monsters.  The villains are the overbearing and negligent government, humans that have lost their humanity, and various shady acquaintances of the crew.  It is such a pity that Fox didn't give this show the chance it deserved. It could have been a classic.
1592401791|5.0|Excellent book by Mr. Emerick by someone who was \\"there\\". The reviewers below nicely sum up my oberservations, save the one reviewer who commented about inaccuracy (Emerick was a key contributor to Anthology and other Beatle historical documentation!). His accounting of historical recordings will drive you back to your CD player (or, as he strongly prefers vinyl) to listen to what he describes (e.g. Patti Harrison providing background scream in Yellow Submarine). Buy it and \\"listen\\" ...
B000ASATWQ|3.0|...I wasn't \\"WOW-ed\\" by this album considering the amount of good press it has been recieving...Some of the tracks like \\"In too deep\\", \\"For the Babies\\", \\"Road to Zion\\", \\"Beautiful\\", and of course \\"Pimpa's Paradise\\" are definitely worth your time...but the rest are just OK!..for a Marley album, it wasnt as deep as I expected..its takes a while to grow on you..
B0001EKZOQ|4.0|I saw the live performance titled \\"Blanco y Negro En Vivo\\" on PBS a while back and was enthralled. I had to have this amazing music - even though I didn't speak a word of Spanish. Not finding a CD of the performance [but one can purchase the DVD here on Amazon] I bought \\"Lagrimas Negras\\" instead. <br /> <br />The combination of Bebo's experienced piano and Cigala's sexy flamenco vocals makes for an interesting cultural mix. Worldly without being \\"World Music\\". <br /> <br />The recording is clear and cleanly mixed, highlighting the two men's abilities. I was glad to find my favorite song from the live performance \\"Bein Paga\\" was included on this album. The piano on this track is especially amazing. <br /> <br />I have to say that although this is an excellent recording, it pales to the live performance and it's sadly short! Buy this and also buy the DVD!
B00002MZ2T|4.0|This was one of the first pop CD's I actually went out and bought...the songs are pure and v.innocent...If you're into sentimental lyrics, this is defintely your kinda deal or else you might find yourself cringing at some point...\\"Two beds and a coffee machine\\", \\"Hold me\\" and \\"The best thing\\" are my personal favourites..I like the \\"jungly\\" feel of \\"The Animal song\\" too... Overall like I said, if ballads are your thing then its hard not to fall in love with this CD...defintely good stuff!
B000AP04MO|3.0|\\"Two for the Road\\" is a film that I admire but I can't say I like particularly.  It's certainly well crafted and the scenes of the French countryside are gorgeous.  The chemistry between Albert Finney and a luminous Audrey Hepburn is palpable.  What was a little offputting to me was the structure of the film where they crosscut moments from the marriage of Finney and Hepburn in non-linear fashion.  The makers of the film may have thought this clever but I found it headache inducing.  Also a little offputting was the constant bickering between the two.  For sure there was some profound insights about the disintegration of this relationship but the verbal sparring became numbing after a while.
B0002J4ZWS|4.0|This movie is one of the best I have seen. The actors are excellent and the story is unforgettable. 4 stars for sure!
0671027344|5.0|Not only is this book amazing--filled with emotional journal entries, wrapped in experiences everyone wishes they were a part of--it also has a great soundtrack listed inside. I love all the songs. If you like Ride, the Smiths, or anything else in there, you will love this book.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|I got this 2 disc set about a week before it was released.  First off Peter Jackson's version of Kong is the greatest portrayed on film, he changes a monster special ef. film into a tragic love story.  He created something very incredible and unique. <br /> <br />The dvd:  <br /> <br />Disc 1:  <br />The audio is amazing on this dvd, along with the crystal clear picture <br /> <br />Extras Disc One: Ads basically, the first for a car it shows some of what went into making the ad and also a movie trailer not for Kong though <br /> <br />Disc 2!: <br />Post Production Diaries, these are great, although they left off Week 13 the Howard Shore score diary :( <br /> <br />I just love these PDs they are truly one of the greatest things Peter Jackson has done in the making of KK05: he lets us know practically everything that went into this film.   <br /> <br />Skull Island Feature: wow!  This is a true gem, you learn the history of skull island from beginning to end, don't want to ruin any of the details of the history, but all I can say is watch it it is a real treat and it lets you know some of those mysteries behind skull island.  <br /> <br />NY Feature: A very good feature that goes into 1933 NY and details some aspects that you might not of picked up on when watching Kong.   <br /> <br />OVERALL <br />This is one of the truly great works of film in the 21st Century by the greatest director, everyone should truly enjoy this mans profilling of a dream in directing king kong.   <br /> <br />With the PJ's 2 Disc Special Edition of King Kong and the Production Diaries creates one amazing 4 disc set that is virtually complete, this is one of the great works of our time.   <br /> <br />I am just waiting until the Extended Edition release in November hopefully.  The only thing I miss is the films trailers which I am sure will be present on the extended edition.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|ok well i can understand how some \\"grown ups\\" may belive that this is a cd for only their generation, because they have witnessed the whole pink floyd revolution and feel that they are somehow included in the the scheme of what the members of pink floyd choose to do. BUT, if you were truly a fan of floyd, whether it was from the 60s when syd barrett was performing \\"bike\\", or to the 80's when david gilmour took over pink floyd, because roger waters passed down the baton...then this cd should bring back great memories, or should be a wonderful cd to create new momories for the new generation. thank you dave for making such a memorable cd, and you should be happy with your effort and performance on this collection of songs. sorry old people..this cd was made for a new generation of floyd listeners. the best song on the cd is by far, the title track \\"on an island\\". pink floyd lives on through you, and your fans love you...you were the best part of pink floyd and the true fans love you..even this 20 yr. old. BUY THIS CD.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|If I had written a review after my first listen through the disc, I probably would have only given it 3 stars.  I agreed with the reviewer who stated that it lacked the \\"Wow\\" factor of Robbie's past efforts.  But I think after a few more listens, it becomes really easy to listen to from the first track to the last.  \\"Ghosts,\\" \\"Tripping,\\" \\"Make Me Pure,\\" and \\"Advertising Space\\" are all great songs that I'm sure will be huge in Europe.  Unfortunately (for his record company), I still don't see this being a huge hit in the US.  What's wrong with us, America (other than our President)?
B00005JOE8|5.0|This movie is freaking awesome. Wehere else can you hear the 1812 overture put to such great use. Love the Guy Fawkes mask. The story is about vengeance but V is the most electrifying hero ever. This is so better than the matrix.
B000E97HIA|4.0|For anyone who that that MUSICOLOGY was the bomb, Prince comes over even funkier on the looser, freer feel that follow up 3121 possesses.  It was doubtful based on what has been called \\"flop-tastic\\" first single \\"Te Amo Corazon\\".  I personally wasn't a huge fan of the single, and I was just praying that the misstep of releasing the decent Latin-tinged track as a single (rather than just as a track on 3121) wouldn't harm the singer.  What occurred instead of a misstep was perhaps the best song by Prince in years, follow up single \\"Black Sweat\\" with its sensual feel, banging drum programming, and simplistic production that showcases the Prince that was prevalent in the 1980s and early 1990s.  None can deny the exceptional nature of \\"Black Sweat\\".  Furthermore, none can deny not only does 3121 trump MUSICOLOGY where the slick and fun factor are concerned, or deny the 3121 just may be Prince's strongest effort in years.  While it may not be different from his past recordings, this is veteran Prince we are seeing now and the veteran is funky enough to please both old and young crowds alike with his fiery 3121.<br /><br />The album opens up with Prince venturing from Mars with dissonant non standards sounds on title track \\"3121\\".  When the verse and the vocals finally enter, you can just feel that presence of the Purple One Himself-the legend continuing to further enhance his persona.  Where \\"Musicology\\" opened the album of the same name with Simplistic, consonant funk,  \\"3121\\" is reminiscent of THE LOVE SYMBOL ALBUM'S opening \\"My Name Is Prince\\" with alternative funk and experimental rock threads lacing it throughout.<br /><br />Prince, just as in MUSICOLOGY, keeps up the pace when he ventures into the even better second track, \\"Lolita\\".  From the first two tracks alone, you feel that where MUSICOLOGY (an exceptional album) was safer, 3121 brings back Prince's more sexual side, even if here it is more restrained than his must sensual works.  \\"Lolita\\" uses a funky drum groove, mixed with cool synthesizers, guitar riffs, and a deep bass sound to round out the arrangement.  Here, you wouldn't think this is a nearly 48 year old Prince, but rather a twenty something Prince still funky fresh.<br /><br />\\"Te Amo Corazon\\" slows down the pace, but can't help but to sound a bit too subdued compared to \\"3121\\" or \\"Lolita\\".  But with the addition of Urban-funk-pop \\"Black Sweat\\" following, the pace of the album is retained.  Two more funky tracks \\"Incense and Candles\\" and \\"Love\\" keep the momentum going, but the momentum truly comes to a head with the balladry of \\"Satisfied\\".  \\"Satisfied\\" sounds as if it should have been written by Ray Charles rather than Prince with the deep bass sound on the bottom end and the whirly organ making for the blusiest number on the album.  Following \\"Satisfied\\", Prince returns full throttle with \\"Fury\\" a straight forward funk-rock tune that rivals \\"the Purple One's\\" strongest works.<br /><br /> While \\"The World\\", \\"Beautiful, Loved & Blessed\\" (featuring Tamar), and \\"The Dance\\" are all fine numbers, they don't quite stack up with the strongest material on the album.  The funky exit track \\"Get on the Boat\\" easily makes you forget about the three previous tunes.  A funk bass line and an \\"in the pocket\\" drum groove makes for one of the best jam tracks in years.  Perhaps the most exciting moment may just be the exceptional sax solo.  Aside from that, the horn riffs are just magnificent.<br /><br />Let's face it, Prince is one of the greatest artists to ever live and his legacy will not be forgotten.  3121 is easily one of Prince's best albums.  Prince easily receives my seal of approval if for nothing more than keeping the spirit of funk and funk-rock alive.  4 stars.drum groove, mixed with cool synthesizers, guitar riffs, and a deep bass sound to round out the arrangement.

0375422889|5.0|What a fabulous story about coming of age in Iran under the mullahs!  Marjane Satrapi's first book revolved around her childhood and the politics occurring at the time.  In this book, she again uses simple but stark drawings and minimal wording to detail the next portion of her life.  Satrapi went to Vienna as her parents wanted a better life for her- a life where she could grow up as the independent and free-thinking woman they wanted her to be.  She tries to adjust to the European lifestyle but quickly spirals into drug usage and eventually homelessness before returning home to Iran.  In Iran, she learns to adjust to the numerous changes, including wearing the veil, the morals police, and all of the streets being named after martyrs for a war in which no one remembers the cause behind it.  She points out that in Vienna she was an Iranian in Europe but in Iran she was more of a European in Iran; it was as if she could never truly fit in until she realized who she was despite all of the politics.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to further their understanding of Iranian culture.
B000002GXS|5.0|Yeah, it's not his actual debut but Closing Time is almost a semi-professional release.  Not yet ready.  This album, his second, is what Tom was all about in the 70's.  Small Change and Nighthawks at the Diner are the trio, throw in One From the Heart soundtrack if you like, of the meat of his 70's work.<br /><br />I'm not sure how many times I've heard this album.  Probably over 100 since I first saw him on the Mike Douglas Show in 1974.  After that I was hooked.  And I don't often listen to any album, even over 3 decades, 100 times or more.  It's just a coincidence that he was from San Diego County (Chula Vista/National City).  What's cool, least for us here, is that he's got San Diego Serenade, and Diamonds On My Windshield which is about the drive from San Diego to L.A.  It's nuttin' but a pure delight to drive that, at night of course, and hear that song on your car stereo.  I mean, it's a rush.  His world and yours come smashing together.<br /><br />I do have strong opinions about his 4 basic phases.<br />The 70's.  Lovely.  Though, I'm quite surprised at myself, the last few years I've sorta found myself leaving that period in favor of:<br />The 80's Rain Dogs/Swordfishtrombones/Frank's Wild Years/Big Time.  Really, the Beautiful Maladies hits package of essentially his 80's work really does it for me now.  It's definitely a next musical sound and stage.  More complex.<br />The 90's wasteland.  Black Rider, Alice, is too sterile.  Too dry, too dark.  I keep expecting to learn to love it and the love never comes.<br />The good news is, there's light at the end of the 90's tunnel.<br />The 2000's.  Yup, essentially, Real Gone.  He's back, like finding the best of his musical heart from the 80's and maybe a dash from the 90's and possibly a hint from the 70's even, possibly.  There's hope baby.  Who knows what he can crank out next.<br /><br />I've always considered his 70's material to be excellent (night) driving music.  There's just something about it.  Occasionally in one of his live shows he'll make the sound of cars driving by, I mean it's a real fun sound to hear and I don't think he's ever put that sound on one of his records.  Makes you feel the connection to the road even more.  In fact, in a few shows, he'll make the sound of trying to get the engine to turn over, hopelessly.  Beautiful sound effect, again, I don't believe, on any album release.<br /><br />New Coat Of Paint is possibly my least favorite song on this album and it's still a winner.<br />San Diego Serenade has some of the finest lyrics of any song, ever.  I'm not much into lyrics.  Very few ever reach me or have much meaning for me.  At church praise lyrics with a good melody, that can move me, in fact, well, there was a SMASHING PUMPKINS type rock band blazin' it at the youth church service and the lyrics were all about a good God thing and I was just crying.  But, that's an aside.  This song, whew doggy, let's put it this way, when I was in a multi-cultural in 17th grade as part of my 5 minutes to say who I was, I played this song.  Semi Suite is such a love song.  Working man's.  Real.<br />Shiver Me Timbers always gets a smile from me.<br />Diamonds On My Windshield (Looking For) will always be precious to my heart.<br />The Heart Of Saturday Night ends up meaning just a little more to me when I realize it's about National City here but it's definitely universal.  One of the great songs.  Period.  I get a real feel of true America listening to this one.<br />Fumblin' With The Blues conveys his character so well, sad, lovelorn, semi lost.  You feel it baby.<br />Please Call Me, Baby.  Man, I think I get choked up every single time I hear this song.<br />Depot, Depot somehow had a bigger impact on me when I was at the San Diego Train station one evening.<br />Drunk On The Moon another example of how Tom is a wordsmith, weaving hearts and minds together in artistry.<br />The Ghosts Of Saturday Night (After Hours At Napoleone's Pizza House).  I can't believe how perfect this is, ending the album as a sort of postlude.  Even better, after 20 years of hearing the album and this song, along with its companion piece, I finally, doi, decided to see if Napoleon's Pizza was still around.  Boy is it.  Right there in National City.  A picture of a returned Tom with the proprietor.  A very simple place.  It's clearly not changed since the 70's.  A fine Provelone sandwich and tasty pizza all at remarkably reasonable prices.  Really sorta are stuck in a bit of a time warp.  It's like Tom willed the place to stay a living shadow/memory/testament to his days working there in the 70's (and I think late 60's).  Feels good bein' there.  Brings the album to life in a subtle way.  Like the other dimension we don't often get to experience with an album.<br /><br />I consider a few albums to be masterpieces, that is, perfect, no weak songs and the ability to still sound great 10, 20, 30 years later:<br />CAT STEVENS Tea For the Tillerman<br />SANTANA s/t<br />STEEL PULSE Reggae Fever<br />HALF JAPANESE The Band That Would Be King<br />  and Music to Strip By<br />JIMI HENDRIX Axis Bold As Love<br />  and Electric Ladyland<br />COCKNEY REJECTS Greatest Hits Vol. I<br />RED ROCKERS Condition Red<br />UNDERTONES s/t<br />The BOBS s/t and My I'm Large<br />CREAM Disraeli Gears and Wheels of Fire<br />YOUNG MARBLE GIANTS Colossal Youth<br />The JAM In the City and The Modern World<br />DAN HICKS and HIS HOT LICKS Where's the Money<br />LED ZEPPLIN I & II<br />The BEATLES White album, Rubber Soul and Abbey Road<br />CROSBY, STILLS and NASH s/t<br />PERE UBU Dub Housing<br />GANG OF FOUR Entertainment<br />The ROCHES s/t<br />(I left off 10 hardcore punk albums, wrong audience)<br />TOM WAITS Heart of Saturday Night, Small Change and Swordfishtrombones are, for me, on this short list. chrisbct@hotmail.comer, after 20 years of hearing the album and this song, along with its companion piece, I finally, doi, decided to see if Napoleon's Pizza was still around.

B000E97HIA|4.0|Many of the reviews that I have read both professional and non-professional, have been talking about how this is Prince's best album since...whenever, usually saying that this is his best album since his prime in the 80's.  Actually, many \\"professional\\" reviews not only say that this is his best album in many years, but that this is his return to greatness after over a decade of releasing \\"self-indulgent nonsense\\".  Huh?!  Now that's a perfect example of why journalists make for great writers but don't necessarily make for very good music critics.  Yes it's true that Prince has released his fair share of less than stellar albums in the past fifteen years or so: \\"Come\\", \\"New Power Soul\\", \\"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\\"-the worst offender of them all being \\"The Vault...Old Friends for Sale\\". He's also released several uneven albums with their fair share of brilliant moments buried `neath the muck (\\"Diamonds and Pearls\\", \\"Chaos and Disorder\\", \\"Crystal Ball\\").  But it is also true that he has released a number of outstanding albums in the midst of all of those misfires: \\"The Rainbow Children\\", \\"Emancipation\\"-save for a good portion of the 3rd disc :-), \\"The Gold Experience\\"-which is probably the best of the bunch, I can't believe that this album is now out of print?!, and \\"The Love Symbol\\", which is also actually pretty uneven but when it's good, it's so bursting at the seams with inspired ingenuity (Love 2 the 9's, The Morning Papers, 3 Chains O' Gold, etc, etc.) that it still deserves to be in this last category.  This release is more consistent in terms of tone and texture than many of Prince's other recent releases, but the problem is that it is also consistently mediocre.  This album is almost completely devoid of Prince's musical wit and ingenuity, and sounds like it could have been created by just about any contemporary R&B star.  So, to say that there's not much here in terms of innovation would be an extreme understatement.  There are a few pseudo-highlights suchas \\"Love\\", \\"Fury\\", \\"The Dance\\" and the horn section on \\"Get on the Boat\\", but most of this album just sounds like Prince is kind of pointlessly going through the motions.  That would be understandable if you know, he had contractual obligations to fill with Warner Bros or something (ha, ha, ha), but at this stage in his career, he's able to put out music at his own leisure.  Prince seems to have set out here to create a mainstream, conventional R&B album .  He succeeded in that, but unfortunately,  he seems to have left his usual wit and ingenuity at the door while doing so.
B000002GYG|5.0|Who has the guts to release a live album that is composed of songs that don't appear on studio release albums by the artist?  I can't think of one though I'm sure they exist.<br /><br />First, it was a double album.  That was a feat by itself.<br /><br />Second, it's so natural to have this smokey piano lounge set committed to vinyl and now cd, Tom's music fit like a glove as a live release.  His between song banter is delightful and has been a hallmark of his live shows throughout his career.  The guy's a comedian, intelligent and successfully creates and maintains a character that's interesting, fun and ya can't, I can't, tell if it's him or not, though it's quite likely similar to Woody Allen's screen character that is simply not his real life self, maybe just a cousin.<br /><br />This is another album that's perfect for night, in fact, late night driving.<br /><br />'Emotional Weather Report' is so perfectly ended.  A real coup.  This song takes you someplace and leaves you off somewhere else.  A pure pleasure.  His word ability shining here.<br /><br />'On A Foggy Night' another journey he takes us on.<br /><br />'Eggs And Sausage (In A Cadillac With Susan ....)'.  It's funny, as great as he is with language and imagrey, with bringing something into sharp focus by a turn of a phrase, each time, at least on his 70's albums, that he talks about waitresses, it just don't swing.  I don't know what it is but his clever word work just gets off the track for that bit of life he tries to convey and leaps back on for each and every one of his other image making phrases.  Funny.  Odd.  Surprising.<br /><br />'Better Off Without A Wife' is such the coolest song.  Should this be played at weddings (probably not) or bachelor parties (probably).<br /><br />'Warm Beer And Cold Women'.  Almost howlin' at the moon time.<br /><br />'Nobody'.  Man, is this a classic or what?  I still get misty eyed whenever I hear this song.  From the heart.  Love song man.<br /><br />'Big Joe And Phantom 309'.  Story telling at its peak.  Yes, someone else wrote it he tells us but he sings it like it came right outta him.  Beautiful, evokative.  Trippy man.<br /><br />Dont' have this album?

B000002H5I|5.0|This is one of the very best CD's I have ever listened to. Tracy Chapman's voice is so beautiful, and soulful. I purchased this CD about ten years ago and still listen to if often because all of the tracks on it are timeless, and they all sound so perfectly together. <br /> <br />Of course my favorite track is Tracy's biggest hit, \\"Fast Car.\\" Her voice is so clear and beauteous and sad on this track. I also enjoy all the other songs on the CD, especially \\"For My Love\\" and \\"Baby Can I Hold You.\\"  <br /> <br />It is hard to believe that Tracy did not break into musical superstardom like today's halfwit wannabe singing stars of the reality TV generation. Tracy Chapman is a musical genius and a superstar to me though.

B00005JKJA|2.0|I watched the DVD (from Netflix) last weekend.  I figured out that the first 2 hours were a dream, but the last 25minutes failed to tie things up.  If you have to go online for a full explanation of a movie, then why bother??  The only part I truly loved was 'Club Silencio'.  It was awesome.   <br /> <br />To those who explained what was really goin on, THANKS.  Because I don't have time to watch the movie 3 or 4 times to 'get it'.
0060989157|5.0|This book tells it all of the rudest, crudest, loudest band ever. No matter where you open it up, there is a new amazing story. I like how it is formatted, different points of view within the same chapter. You really fell like each member is telling you themselves. I would highly recommend this to ALL Crue fans, or any fan of 80's Rock and Roll. A real must read.
0060254920|5.0|I have never forgotten the joy of this book and already my little granddaughter Moira Catherine is loving it every minute.  You cannot skip a word because she has it memorized and she is only 2 1/2 years old.  A very bright little girl, if I do say so as a prould Grandpa.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|Had I not read the book prior to seeing this film, I would've been delighted by it. The acting--especially Eugene Hutz, who steals the show--cinematography and pacing are great.  <br /> <br />But having read the book, I can only say I'm disappointed. Leaving out the fantasy flashback sequences doesn't bother me--it's understandable given their strangeness and how disconnected they are from the road trip narrative. But why did Schrieber decide to change so much of the rest of the story? <br /> <br />Excising parts I understand. Shaping, trimming, modifying, I understand. But there are distinct things in the story that have been entirely changed for this version, and unnecessarily so.  <br /> <br />On its own, this is a delightful film, but the adaptation unfortunately takes my rating down a notch from where it would otherwise be.  <br /> <br />
B000E6UWE4|5.0|GotM is just the beginning of a wonderfully entertaining historical account of the Malazan Empire. It is not a typical fantasy novel; and for that I am thankful. It does not follow the same formulaic approach as Jordan and Goodkind, and many others, where a young man, from some farmtown, is suddenly on a quest to save the world from something unspeakably evil. Erikson assumes you are intelligent,and can form your own thoughts based on what you read. Some things are not explained and this has caused some readers to greatly dislike this book. However, this is a series of ten books, and evertihng is eventually neatly tied together at some point. Don't bother obsessing over the details, just enjoy the mystery. The world-building in this novel is second to none. Anyone who has read beyond book one will attest the greatness of Eriksons character development. Deadhouse Gates amd Memories of Ice have some of the most heart-wrencing climaxes in the history of fantasy. GotM is indeed the weakest of the series, but it is still a great book. Characters you meet here are developed along the way in the next books. It does start of a little confusing, but never as perplexing as some reviewers have made out. This is a novel for intelligent people, who can keep track of things. A truly great series in the making.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|There is an old joke in which a minor player in a production of Hamlet was asked what the play was about and he replies, \\"Well, it's about this gravedigger...\\"     What Serenity was all about, ultimately, was the director, Joss Whedon. At the end of the day he is the great continuous link to every stage of filmmaking - writing, directing, art direction and editing as well as where the buck finally stops with the producer. I suspect that in his secret heart he placed a small shroud over the place where the 1992 film of Buffy the Vampire Slayer rested, vowing to return to the cinema once again, this time to Do It Right.    Based on the short-lived television programme Firefly, Serenity picks up more or less where the series ended, though the difficulties inherent in capturing the interest of and speaking with respect to both newcomers as well as established fans causes ineradicable cracks in the structure of the film. The normally wonderful characters are not showcased so much as swamped by the sound and fury of what was designed to be a blockbuster motion picture event. The gravitational pull exerted by attempting to make the money people happy is not the ideal arena for Joss Whedon's talents to surface. I know what he is capable of - I have seen all his work that is available on DVD - and all I can assume is that in his haste to return to the big screen - along with the time and money constraints placed upon him by the studio - he was overwhelmed at last. In a way I suspect that he thought this was his one shot at the big time, which is a shame because the film suffers for it.    After I saw Serenity I went back and viewed the first three episodes of Firefly. I wondered if I was mistaken in my first impression of the television show and was relieved to find that I was not - it was a wonderful series, full of light and colour and texture, warmth and terror and humour as well as fantastic, skillfully-realised characters. The cast consistently shone through and beyondthe special effects and the series enjoyed a deft and refreshing art direction, marrying the cultures of east and west under the overarching theme of pioneering a new life as independent entities. In comparison, the film Serenity was corporate product helmed by a director clearly under stress to keep everyone happy, though in Whedon's defense, I honestly don't see how it could have been acccomplished otherwise. In the greater scheme of things, Firefly had a relatively small following and the structure of an entire film based on the slender plinth of few fans and fewer episodes was bound to wobble a bit.    The television series was essentially an ensemble - and was better for it. The decision to make Serenity almost entirely about River Tam could be seen as a serious, even crippling, liability. Even when not in first-person narrative, having a mentally unstable protagonist puts a serious limitation on the number of people who can relate to that character. Sympathise with, perhaps, but not actually identify with, which is the primary duty of a protagonist.    On the plus side, the editing is superb - crackling crisply where it needs to and lovingly lingering where it is called for in the quiet moments. From scene to scene, the lighting design is inspired and enhances the story in subtle but definitive ways, fluently describing the language of visual emotion. Summer Glau is astonishing as River Tam, never tiresomely mad like some on-screen portrayals of un-hinged-ness and it is a pure joy to watch her move. She fights with the effortless grace of a person with their soul on fire. Adam Baldwin is once again simply splendid as Jayne Cobb, casting sardonic asides with the simple conviction of the devoutly cynical.     Nathan Fillion as Captain Malcom Reynolds - the natural choice for protagonist in the television series - not only goes very dark in the film, he sits right down, and for the most part, stays there. He tends to pick his battles for very private reasons -  some might say too private - since where and when he chooses to make his St Crispin's Day stand is never clearly realised nor adequately explained by the screenplay. It is a very nice speech for all that. The surpassingly lovely Gina Torres as Zoe and Alan Tudyk as Wash are only fleetingly allowed to do what they do best, love each other, and Gina Torres' usual role as Mal's right hand seems in the film to be truncated into an afterthought, which is a shame since no one sells conviction and purpose like the wonderful Gina Torres.    Morena Baccarin as Inara, Ron Glass as Shepherd Book, Sean Maher as Simon Tam and the sparkling Jewel Staite as Kaylee are reduced to mere ciphers by the screenplay. This is also a sadness since the strength and charm and beauty of the series was structured in a way to both showcase and dovetail the quirks, passions, flaws and desires of each character, and all in a way that made the whole much greater than the sum of its parts.    At the end of the film, after all the kicking, fighting, fleeing and imaginative bi-lingual cussing are done, the Ultimate Bad Guy calmly and in no uncertain terms tells the Flawed But Hopefully Well-Meaning Good Guy that everything he's just spent the past 119 minutes (of my life)  trying to accomplish is completely and utterly futile and that it won't even make a dent in the larger scheme of things. Why does this make me so sad? Because when a great story is told, a viewer invests something of themselves in that story and they deserve to come away with a sense that this investment was worth...something.    I have obviously given this film way too much thought, so will bring this stream-of-consciousness natter to a close, but before I do I would like to mention the tenth character, the ship Serenity itself. In the film it seems to completely transcend the typical film set to become a place which lives and breathes in its own right. In two astonishing takes and one invisible edit, the viewer is granted a tour of the interior which through some strange visual alchemy appears to indeed be a place worth dying to protect. And worth living for in order to journey on. If you see Serenity, see it for the ship. It really is the ideal home and a truly fitting character to name the film after.
B00005UKKF|3.0|Although this is a good concert and tour (arguably Britney's best), its certainly not \\"the best\\" of all time, as described by other reviewers.     Take away the fancy stage sets, the pyro and other special effects and you're basically left with nothing. Being a good performer is more than just gimmick. (Anyone is capable of that). If you can't entertain without those props backing you up, how good are you an entertainer? All of Michael Jackson's concerts contain nothing more than his stand up microphone and his band, and yet he still can leave you mesmerized beyond belief after the performance is over. Would Britney be able to do that? I very readily doubt so.    If you liked this tour, you'll probably enjoy Janet Jackson's 1997 'The Velvet Rope' tour. Britney borrowed a few things from this concert, most noticeably, the costumes for her back-up dancers during \\"Stronger\\" were clearly taken from the ones from \\"You\\". Janet not only delivers fun dance songs (\\"Escapade\\", \\"Nasty,\\" \\"When I think of you,\\" etc), but also gives you something with substance and a message as well, with performances of \\"Rhythm Nation\\", \\"What About\\", \\"You\\" among others - its the full spectrum. Not just pop fluff. That is something the 'Dream Within A Dream' tour lacks sourly. Though I suppose, this is not to say it is Britney's fault, for she doesn't sing those type of songs in the first place.    'The Velvet Rope' tour may not have video montages and giant waterfalls like this one, but it'll dazzle you just the same...if not, more.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture, Director and Screenplay) \\"Capote\\" was my favorite film of 2005.  I thoroughly believe that in other, less talented hands, this film would have been a mess.  Director Bennett Miller has made a beautiful film with uniformly brilliant performances.  Without once drifting into gross caricature Philip Seymour Hoffman (who won the Oscar for his performance) did the impossible by bringing Capote the person and not Capote the persona to life.  Catherine Keener (an Oscar nominee for her work here) plays Nell Harper Lee with great understatement.  Chris Cooper as investigator Alvin Dewey, Clifton Collins Jr as murderer Perry Smith and Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy, are equally effective in challenging roles.<br /><br />\\"Capote\\" isn't easy.  This is not a standard Hollywood bio-pic.  It was never the intention of screenwriter Dan Futterman to adapt Gerald Clarke's exhaustive biography of Capote in its entirety, but rather to bring to the screen those chapters dealing with the author's life at the time he was compoing his true-crime masterpiece \\"In Cold Blood.\\"<br /><br />Much fuss mas been made over the fact that Truman used Perry Smith and Dick Hickock in an exploitive way; that he \\"needed\\" them alive only long enough to reveal their side of things, and then executed in order to finish his book.  I'm not totally convinced that the author's actions were so cold or calculated.  I know from what I've read (and now seen) that Capote was truly conflicted about his obligation to these men.  He did pay for their first appeal.  Still, did he do all that he could to see that thier death sentence was commuted?  Was he actually honor bound to do more on their behalf?  Let us not forget the family of four who lay dead in that farm house - they were shown no mercy, given no appeals and certainly no stay of execution.  These are the issues the film brilliantly explores.  In the end \\"Capote\\" presents one of the most acutely realized and compelling examinations of personal and professional ethics in relation to the creative process, and the often corrupting influence the persuit of greatness can have on the artist.  This is a must see film.one of the most acutely realized and compelling examinations of personal and professional ethics in relation to the creative process, and the often corrupting influence the persuit of greatness can have on the artist.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I took a bit of a risk with this box set, buying it solely on my love of intelligent sci-fi and on the strength of the reviews posted here.  <br /> <br />Now, half-way through, I have certainly not been disappointed! <br /> <br />But am I the only one who feels Whedon has clearly been influenced by Blakes 7? We have a crew of 7 (OK nine after the two mysterious siblings have been picked up) renegades fleeing from the clutches of the boo-hiss Alliance (who wear uniforms not dissimilar to the Federation in the B7 universe). We have splendidly complex and rounded characters, who are not 100% good or bad. Captain Reynolds owes more than a little to Paul Darrow's Avon I reckon. Whereas alien planets would generally be represented by a quarry or similar in B7, some Wild Western scrubland does the same job in Firefly. The scenario in the Firefly episode Bushwacked is *extremely* similar to the B7 episode in which the gang first find the Liberator. Finally, I noted some dialogue in Firefly (\\"I was aiming for his head\\") lifted directly from the B7 scripts. Sincerest form of flattery? Yeah maybe. But so what? I thoroughly enjoyed Blakes 7 (wobbly sets and all) and I am thoroughly enjoying Firefly too.  <br /> <br />This is undoubtedly thought-provoking, intelligent sci-fi with very strong characterisation. Whedon's notion to set it as a Western may require some viewers to suspend their disbelief quite a bit, but if you just go with the flow you will not be disappointed. There's a great sense of fun in here too. Trust me, this is light years ahead of Voyager or Enterprise.  <br /> <br />Decent enough extras - commentaries and stuff. Sadly no 5.1 sound though. <br /> <br />Two disks still to go! Wa-Hay! And I'm sure I will feel a sense of loss when I've watched them all. <br /> <br /> <br />
0792454154|3.0|This is indeed the most economical and yet complete collection of the \\"canon\\", but prbably for the sake of economy the quality of paper & printing have been severely compromised. Also, the font is very small and consequently makes the reading of these works a pain rather than a pleasure.
B00007KWHN|5.0|The Yes album was Yes' third album which was a make or break album for the band.  If this album didn't sell well Atlantic was going to cut them.  The band didn't have to worry about that because every single one of the songs on this album are masterpieces!  Starting with the opening track Yours is no disgrace and finishing up with the album closer Perpetual Change.  My favorite song on this album (and one of my all time favorite songs in general) is Starship Trooper.  If your a fan of Prog Rock or just starting to get into the band Yes start here.  You won't be disappointed.
B000001GXB|5.0|Forget about the debate on whether or not Pollini has the highest dynamic control and technical facility among all living pianists, as when it comes to this partcicular set of recordings (made in June 1975 for op. 109 and 110, Sept. 1976 for op.106, Jan. 1977 for op. 101 and 111) this debate is completely irrelevant.  <br />What a sublime, intense and wondefully heart-warming interpretation of Beethoven's late sonatas.  A sprititual experience. Please do listen to other greats like Brendel, Arrau, Kempff, Rubenstien, and then listen to Pollini's; in these particular works, Mr. Pollini will make you forget that you have ever heard these pieces before.  The music flows as new and fresh as it must have sounded in the great composer's head. <br /> <br />What a delicious op. 101. <br />What an unforgetable performance of the Hammerklavier, with its slow movement so deeply medidative and its third movement almost rising to other-wordly dimensions. And for the first time, you will thoroughly enjoy the Fugue. You will never get enough of the elegance and beauty of op. 109, 110.  As for op. 111, words do not rise to the occasion. Pollini's interpretation leaves one speachless: dramatic, deeply felt, highly noble, and yet spontaneous and flowing like un unstoppable stream. As another reviewer put it: Perfect...a fitting performance of Beethoven's last piano sonata. <br />   <br />Some may not know that Mr. Pollini is also a humble and approachable artist. If you hear his interviews or talk to him after a concert, he will tell you that he records pieces only after having played them extensively in public performances.  What an impressive artist: the magical journey of discovery he produced in the 70's with this recording set is being produced again with new ones, such as the Apassionata recording released in March 2003.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A SciFi series with a superb ensemble cast and great action. Good stories which would have evolved into an excellent series if given more time. If you've never seen it, after viewing all the episodes you'll be wishing for more. A great collector's item.

B000301YY8|5.0|James Blunt has a voice that is very reminiscent of Barry Gibb. As a matter of fact when I heard this CD for the first time, I was convinced that I was listening to The Bee Gees. I loved the song \\"You're Beautiful\\" but I fell totally in love with the entire CD after the first listen.  Sad and sweet, beautiful and bittersweet this CD is a must have for those who love ballads and music with attitude. Don't hesitate, it's just gorgeous!
B000A6T262|5.0|Needless to say, the movies are great and Amazon is great to do business with. The only complaint I have is with the packaging. The DVD cases are nearly as thick as a VHS case so there is no significant space savings here. Not that would be the primary reason for buying this set, just an observation. If you like Star Trek and want a complete set of the Star Trek movies, you can't go wrong with this one.
0440241588|3.0|This is a beach book or \\"On the Plane\\" book.  Nothing more.  The plot is interesting and engaging, but somewhere in the middle of the book, I think the author got bored with his own plot and seeked to end it quickly as he ran out of ideas. <br /> <br />The book ended rather anti-climatic and felt rushed.  I would recommend only for light, non-intelligent, easy reading.
0385474547|5.0|Achebe's world of tribal Nigeria is a wonderful response to the imperialistic image of \\"savage\\" African peoples that was held during the time of colonization.  The themes extend far beyond just this, however, as we see a character enveloped by anger and fear, and the many people his emotions influence.  The intricate laws and language of the people will not soon be forgotten after reading about how Okonkwo's life truly does begin to fall apart.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki makes great films. This, for many, was the first film of his that a lot of \\"Westerners\\" saw. And, as far as first impressions go, this is one of his best works. <br /> <br />The film follows a young girl, Chihiro, as she gets stuck in a land for the spirits. It's a fantastic story showcasing her trials, and how she grows from them. The story is very fleshed out, you are able to connect with all of the characters, and the imagery used in the film is simply beautiful. <br /> <br />I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good story, or a good movie, or just wants to have a nice time. Even if anime isn't your thing, this film can still be for you.

0517255464|5.0|Mainly for intermediate-level artists- it's a highly *comprehensive* way to appreciate Bridgman's work.<br /><br />It has a little bit of everything depicting figure construction from memory. It's also great for general improvement; a few tips & tricks- an in-depth reference for all working artists.<br /><br />This somewhat large-sized Complete Guide seems intended to represent the best of 6 out of his 7 individual books. Drawing the Female Form is the book that gets left out. Assembled & designed by editor Howard Simon in 1952; Bridgman passed away in 1943, so it's not Bridgman's fault if anyone has issues with the layout(!).<br /><br />Here's a quick breakdown of his 6 individual books, from my very favorite to least...<br /><br />1. [[ASIN:048622709X Book of a Hundred Hands]]- His *best* representation of hands; if hands are your main interest, skip all else & buy 100 hands.<br /><br />2. [[ASIN:0486211045 Constructive Anatomy]]- His clearest & most detailed line work in his figure anatomy- especially with his cube-based construction of the head.<br /><br />3. [[ASIN:0486227103 Bridgman's Life Drawing]]- Like a mini Complete Guide, it's often considered Bridgman's best individual book. It gives us full-figure movement, as well as briefly treating the figure in its essential parts.<br /><br />4. [[ASIN:0486227081 Heads, Features and Faces]]- Great for beginners; it isn't in-depth, and it isn't nearly overwhelming like this Complete Guide.<br /><br />5. [[ASIN:0486227073 Human Machine]]- Genius in concept- drawings exceedingly sketchy. These are the sketchiest drawings in this Complete Guide.<br /><br />6. [[ASIN:0486418022 Drawing the Draped Figure]]- *Very* basic. Everything you need from this exceedingly thin book is included in this Complete Guide.<br /><br />In short- The basic point of Bridgman's Complete Guide is to help people to draw figures more convincingly, and even from memory. To a great degree, at least in my opinion, this book still succeeds in a very effective way...<br /><br />P.S. This book is definitely *not* for beginners! Only *intermediate-level* artists need apply. For beginners, I highly recommend getting [[ASIN:0399507914 Drawing the Head and Figure]] by Jack Hamm.<br /><br />P.P.S.

B000065NOS|4.0|The gasoline fight scene in this movie is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a movie! They picked the perfect song for the fight...

B000003TA2|5.0|Inspired by the New York art scene, Sonic Youth bludgeoned their way into the rock and roll world courtesy of SST Records, which handled all their material up to \\"Goo\\", which is now considered an alt-rock classic.<br /><br />  Sonic Youth specialize in a peculiar blend of detuned and unconventionally tuned guitars, swirling in feedback, distortion and volume.  Far from being nothing but a metallic shriek, SY somehow manage to work in bits of beauty, albeit the kind that extra-terrestrials probably dig, a solid beat thanks to Steve Shelley, one of rock's best drummers, and vocals that scream, moan, whisper and croon.<br /><br />  \\"Dirty Boots\\" opens with an almost ethereal intro until bassist Kim Gordon bulls her way in with fuzz bass and Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo slam away at their guitars, creating sounds that captivate as well as maim.<br /><br />  We progress through a homage to Karen Carpenter (!?), a guest rap by Chuck D. and a glorious feedback symphony with \\"Mote\\" that churns and burns, making the listener fear his stereo may overload and combust into flames.<br /><br />  \\"Disappearer\\" is the most accessible tune before closing with \\"Scooter + Jinx\\" and \\"Titanium Exposure\\".<br /><br />  \\"Goo\\" and Sonic Youth are not for the faint hearted.  Music should reflect all our emotions and SY, with every release, somehow capture the sound of chaos, the beauty of parallel worlds and lyrics of urban life.  The fact that they have survived for a couple of decades now shows that there is a need for this special kind of noise in each one of us.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Having waited ages for this movie to be released in the UK I could wait no longer so bought the DVD from the states. Worth the wait? Definitely. The movie story is true to the stage show but loses a couple of songs (Christmas Bells being the most obvious missing).  <br /> <br />What I really liked about the movie that differentiates it from the stage version is the ability to place the scenes in real life locations. The best of which was the tear-jerking funeral scene for Angel in a beautiful sun-lit church. My wife (who never saw Rent on stage) was crying all through I'll Cover You B.  <br /> <br />The acting is first rate and you still get goose bumps from Light my Candle, tingles up your spine from Another Day and sheer enjoyment from La Vie Boheme, live in the Live Cafe - incredible scenes. <br /> <br />DVD Extras - There is a full length documentary on the history of Rent with loads about Jonathan Larson, very interesting and quite poignant. I never realised that Ali, Pam, Sue and Gordon were all real friends of Larson's who died of AIDS. <br /> <br />Overall - highly recommended - worthy of anyones money and you will watch again and again. It will tide me over until next time I'm in NYC and can get to the Nederlander. <br /> <br />Thank you Jonathan Larson
0688156819|5.0|THis is the funniest, Awsome, strangest and farout book I have ever read. This is my favorite book.
B000002AH1|4.0|<br />This review concentrates on the four live tracks. <br /> <br />By December 1970, Miles Davis' fusion was evolving even beyond the Bitches Brew era. The emphasis was more and more in the rhythm, and less and less on coherent solos. Miles Davis stuck a wah-wah pedal on his horn, getting a sound that was thin, whiny and rather annoying. Keith Jarrett and Michael Henderson joined the band, lending the band a unique keyboard sound and a funkier bass respectively.  <br /> <br />Live Evil basically consists of several edited jams from the Cellar Door recordings of December 1970.  <br /> <br />SIVAD: <br />The recording begins on a high point; vicious funk punctuated by Airto Moreira's squawking Cuica, and stabbed through with Miles Davis' electric trumpet. This is actually a version of \\"Directions\\" by Joe Zawinul, although the tune is so evolved it is basically unrecogniseable. The statements of the theme have been excised with a razor blade. Miles' horn is electric, and its sound is a mixture of Birth of the Cool and Axis: Bold as Love. Truly strange, and frankly not a very nice sound. <br /> <br />Three and a half minutes in, the groove shifts to \\"Honky Tonk\\", a minimalistic and not very inspiring theme. The performance is sellotaped together from two separate live performances of the tune (!) and one studio version! Miles sometimes plays with an open horn on this section; and Airto Moreira makes weird wailing noises that sound rather corny. Sloppy and shapeless. <br /> <br /> <br />WHAT I SAY: <br />A feature for Jack de Johnette, a terrific drummer. The groove is extremely harsh and energetic, with Miles soloing with an open horn. Unlike the other tracks, this is actually a complete performance (segueing into \\"Sanctuary\\" at the end) and is quite impressive. I really like Jarret's electric piano/organ solo and Johnette's drum solo! <br /> <br /> <br />FUNKY TONK/INAMORATA: <br />In which Teo Macero goes nuts with the scissors. This is actually one big slab of a performance, cut arbitrarily in half to fit both sides of an LP. And it is not one piece of music, but three: <br />1. \\"Directions\\": Yet another performance of Zawinul's piece. Much more conventional than the \\"Sivad\\" version, though again with all the statements of the theme cut out. Miles soloes with electric trumpet. <br /> <br />2. Then the groove shifts to a piece which resembles the Mission Impossible theme! So this is where they got that theme. The name of the tune is sometimes called \\"Funky Tonk\\", and sometimes \\"Inamorata\\". A very long, sloppy, shapeless morass of solos. Again, Jarret's solo is most beautiful. <br /> <br />3.Finally the groove shifts to \\"It's About That Time\\" from \\"In a Silent Way\\". A performance that does not shift into the second bassline. Halfway through a gloomy voice narrates a weird, associative poem about the mysteries of Music.  <br />At the fade-out, you can hear the groove shifting to \\"Sanctuary...\\" <br /> <br />Overall, the album is extremely messy, with a good deal of self-indulgent excess masking some excellent soloing. Atmospheric and very dense.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is one of the grandest moments in rock n' roll history.  If you are a true fan of rock n' roll you must have this one in your collection.....along with Dark Side Of The Moon.  The Wall was a grand concept by Roger Waters carried out to perfection.  It contains some of the greatest songs in history......Another Brick In The Wall, Hey You, Comfortably Numb, Run Like Hell, etc...  Long live Pink Floyd.  They're one of the top 3 or 4 bands of all-time.
B000E33VWW|5.0|this movie is in my top 5 of 2005.. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a great job in this film as capote... capote is working on a new book a non fiction book. so he reads something in a paper about a family of four murdered.. so he befriends one of the two killers so he can write his book about what happend that night of the killings. this movie is great a must see!!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I watched it on TV, which triggered me to remember how many of their songs I knew and loved, and I knew I wanted a keepsake for myself.  A friend was visiting, mentioned how her son loves the Eagles, we watched the one I had ordered, and she had me order the second one through your website, for her (& maybe her son will get it eventually.) It's great music, fun to watch as they are very entertaining.  Anything I have ordered through Amazon.Com, I have been happy with.
0062502182|5.0|This book, I would say is one of the best books I ever read. A lot of people might not say that, or over look this book because it's not a very long book, or overly detailed book. If you are looking for a book you can finish within  1 to 7 day's  this is the perfect book. If you feel lost or want have a confidence boost read this book. Another great thing about this book is how it touch's slightly oh so very slightly on Sufism and gives a taste for what sufism is. It's book that doesn't throw alot at you at one time, and gives the reader just enought of a simple yet elegant story to read. This book will touch on all your emotions, some more than others, but a fair amount. If their were to be a perfect book, a perfect story this would be the closest thing to it. You won't get tired and you will always want to read more.
B000002UVX|5.0|This is by far the best-known out of Jimi's live releases, partially because it was the only official live album of his lifetime. And the truth is it's quite good. In fact, it's my second-favorite Hendrix album (behind only masterpiece Electric Ladyland).<br />Jimi's sound was changing around this time, and it makes me wonder what future LP's would have been like had Jimi lived to release them. Whereas AYE and Axis (and Electric Ladyland, to a lesser extent) were mainly psychadelic efforts, Band of Gypsies is more. True, it is heavily drenched in psychadelia (listen to masterpiece Machine Gun for an example) but it's more than that. The album is jazzier and funkier than anything Hendrix would release before, even integrating gospel music occasionally. That and the Band of Gypsies, with Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums, is the best band Jimi ever worked with.<br />OK, so what about the music? Well, of course it's good. Besides Machine Gun - a candidate for Jimi's best song - it also boasts the loose jam Who Knows, complete with its improvised lyrics by drummer Buddy Miles, and the well-written Power of Soul, mislabled \\"Power to Love\\". Plus it's got Message to Love, a gospel rave-up that has zero control. In truth, the only place this album really falters are Buddy Miles' two compositions. Though they are enjoyable pieces, neither of the two can compare with Machine Gun or Power of Soul.<br />Another good thing about this disc is how Jimi uses a set of all new songs here. Most artists use the live album to play their hits. But the Band of Gypsies material was 100% new, so don't ocming looking for the 1,000th version of Foxey Lady, Red House or Voodoo Child (Slight Return).
0800141660|5.0|Ang Lee directed, and Emma Thompson wrote and starred in, this wonderfully romantic adaptation of the Jane Austin novel, full of exquisite locations and costumes, as well as superb performances. In the Empire period of England, Mrs. Dashwood (played by Gemma Jones) and her three daughters - Elinor (Emma Thompson), Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Margaret (Emilie Francois) - are left all but destitute upon the death of her wealthy husband, his having bequeathed the bulk of his estate to his son from a previous marriage. Because of the generosity of relatives, the Dashwoods are set up in a cottage in the country, where they meet three gentlemen: two young suitors with financial difficulties - Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) and John Willoughby (Greg Wise) - and a third, middle aged widower, Colonel Brandon (played by Alan Rickman), who owns the largest estate in the county.<br /><br />Thompson shines as Elinor, the sister with the most practicality (sense), and Winslet is perfect as Marianne, the sister with the most passion (sensibility). Their hearts and fortunes are up in the air, as Elinor withholds her feelings from Grant's fumbling and elusive Edward, whom she thinks is engaged to someone else; and Marianne throws her heart carelessly at the feet of Wise's dashing but inconstant Willoughby. Rickman's stable and less interesting Colonel Brandon bides his time, as he waits to see how circumstances will play out, meanwhile doing his best to be a good friend to the family. Emotions run high, and disappointments deep, but the payoff is pure jubilation. The ending is one of the most emotionally explosive I've ever experienced. If you love to cry, get ready.<br /><br />Among the delights of this film is the supporting cast. Imelda Staunton as the busybody Charlotte Palmer and Hugh Laurie as her stolid yet subtly sarcastic husband are classic. Other performances were equally fun. This film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay, which it won for Thompson's script. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is one of the great romantic masterpieces of all time.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithpt. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is one of the great romantic masterpieces of all time.    Waitsel Smith

0300108834|5.0|Excellent overview of the history of western civilation for children.  I have been reading one chapter per night with my 9 year old son and he is enthralled.  Provides an excellent basis for discussion.  Written for children but does not simplify.  Focused on the basics but touches on other cultures too but with a western view.  This book should be required reading in our schools.

B000E33VWW|5.0|Truman Capote's Novel \\"In COld Blood\\" was a landmark in both America's literary history as well as her criminal justice system.  This film joins Capote's book as revolutionary.  Breathtaking cinematographic approaches, incredible screenwriting, and a stellar performance by Phillip Symour Hoffman lend to this incredible cinematic achievement. <br />Capote takes a unique approach at telling the story of eccentric American writer Truman Capote, while simultaneously retelling the horrifying story of the Kansas murders.  This is a film that I as a movie-goer can only hope will stand in history as a land-mark motion picture.
B000DZIGE4|1.0|This film is a dark portrayal of the U.S. Marine Corps as seen through the eyes of Hollywood. The movie starts off negative and continues down the path of resentment and disdain toward the first Gulf war. The producers of this emotional diatribe want the public to assume the same bitterness they hold for the war and the military in general. <br /> <br />Hollywood has been called the entertainment capitol of the world, but this is not entertainment. It is however a waste of time and money. Anthony Swofford's disaffected view of his military experience is a personal tragedy but not one that needs to be reiterated in a public forum.

THIS GEM IS ONE OF THEM NOT TO OPEN. SO I CANT TELL YOU IF ITS IN STEREO OR THE MONO VERSION.
6302256615|3.0|Keanu Reeves and Patrick 'Sleazy' are good<br />together here in this very likable surfer /<br />bank robber flick. Does kind of give surfers<br />a bad rep though! Lori Petty and Gary Busey<br />are superb in supporting roles. In fact Busey<br />(until he's killed off) steals most of his<br />scenes, if not the whole movie as the robbery<br />cop vet who takes Reeves under his wing and<br />steers him in the right direction. A good come-<br />back for Swazey after the stupid 'Ghost' and<br />sappy 'Dirty Dancing'! That killer wave in Aus-<br />tralia/finish is outstanding! {Actually three-<br />and-one half-stars).
B000DZIGDU|3.0|What Jarhead did right is that it finally filled the void of a new brand of war movie.  The genre has lacked originality since the release of Saving Private Ryan.  Sadly, this unique approach to war and wartime was not enough to save the mediocre acting, directing, and screenplay that was Jarhead.  It is too bad that a better filmaker didn't have the opportunity to make this movie.  It could have been a masterpiece.
B000008LH5|5.0|Alvin Lee  has always been one of rock's truly underated guitarists....and this album is a fine example of his versatility. <br />from the very beginning...when he goes into \\"one of these days\\" <br />to the very end when he comes out for an encore on \\"choo choo momma\\", Alvin rocks your world..and pulls at your heartstrings with some very nice blues. <br />My personal favorite is \\"i'm goin' home\\" <br />A must have and a must listen..preferrably at full volume

Bottom line, it's a must read!  Give him a break Oprah!

Hey, Prince..if you ever want to help an aspiring lyricist, I'd love 2 have u put my words with your music!!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Ok first of all He did a great movie.  All of you saying that he is pathetic are morons.   Almost everything said in the movie is true.  We are going to iraq for the oil and for stupid reasons , (not for terrorist.  People are blinded into beliving what the media says everyday.  Soldiers are dying everyday for what? the country?  But for what?  Terrorism?  Oil?  Power?  Bush is a moron plain and simple he is a crackhead that is as smart as a rock.  \\"leeds our country\\"  Whos country? this country isnt yours this country is Mexican and Native Indians.  You white peple stole it. Learn some history, people.
B000E97HIA|3.0|As a long-time fan, I have to say that Prince appears to be finally getting back to his old self, musically (ie; funky, experimental, drum machine).  I like hearing that old LINN drum machine again and '3121' is just odd enough to make you want to hear more.  Better than Musicology and most of his 90's work.  There are a few 'fillers' that sound like he's trying to keep up with the younger artists, but most of the melodies and choruses (like the infectious 'Love') really make you remember what it was like being a Prince fan in the 80's.  He loses points from me for trying too hard to sound contemporary, but gains with a musical vibe that makes me remember the good old days, when you looked forward to a new Prince album like a kid on Christmas morning.    So far, I think there are at least 6 very good songs on here--out of 12.  But those 6 songs are worth the price of admission and who knows how many more will grow on me, as is customary with most Prince albums.  Now, if only he'd start putting out b-sides again...

I dont know if its because of growing up in the country living on a farm, or my time as a rodeo clown but this movie touched me on many levels.

B00002SWEM|5.0|I first saw this documentary on PBS and was blown away. I was previously unaware of this beautiful music, but as a result of seeing the show, I rushed right out and bought the CD which then played nearly continuously on the CD player in my car. The music draws you in and doesn't let go. There is such an easy, upbeat feel to it, without it being at all like the \\"easy listening\\" genre. This documentary captures the essence of the genesis of the music , as well as being just down right entertaining.  This viewer came away feeling that I really know these musicians. I have acquired a respect and love for this music and the musicians who create it.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|Whedon's quirky sci-fi western is exactly the kind of television viewing that Fox desperately needs. Unfortunately for them, they don't recognize talent when they see it. <br /> <br />Skilled writing is evident in Whedon's use of sparse dialogue to paint complex characters whose personalities only gradually unfold duringing the series. Fox's premature termination of the series prevents us from finding the answers to so many questions raised in this aborted classic that we will have to forever live with dissatisfaction and speculation. Our only hope is that we will see more movies like Serenity from this talented screenwriter that will give us insight into what we are missing. <br /> <br />This series is a must-own for anyone who wants a series with complex characters, flawed personalities and anti-heroes with a conscience. Reflecting real life, Firefly's passengers and crew pose more questions with every revelation of their past. We never find the answers to such questions as why Inarra signed up with Serenity and left her high-profile position. We now have no chance of discovering why Book was a Shepherd and why he knows so much about those who skirt the law. Mal's motivations continue to be a mystery along with River's capabilities. And we will never find the answer to whether or not Kaylee gets her man. <br /> <br />Ultimately we have to live with the disappointment of never knowing for sure even as we enjoy over and over the tidbits that we do know.
B00005JOUM|2.0|From Triniman's Blog, Desicritics and Blogcritics. <br /> <br />Given that this is a Spike Lee production, it just couldn't be a straight-ahead heist film.  And it isn't. <br /> <br />The hostages change into the same outfits that the bad guys are wearing, thus making them all look alike.  You see flash forward interviews of the hostages in people in police custody, with the cops trying to trip them up to figure out who the thieves are.   <br /> <br />The acting is fine all around, but there are no knockout performances that will be remembered  at Oscar nomination time.  Christopher Plummer plays the paranoid bank president, with a deep, dark secret to hide.  He enlists of the help of a mysterious power broker played by Jodie Foster, to protect his secret.  You just don't get a sense that her character really had a chance to use exercise her  power, and thus give us more insight into who she is and what she can do. <br /> <br />Clive Owen seems cool, calm and in control as the lead bagd guy.  There are clues throughout the film about how things will unfold with this character, but you're supposed to just mentally file them away since they don't give you any \\"a-ha\\" moments when you see them. If you see something that doesn't seem to add to the story, pay attention. <br /> <br />The dialogue contains references to race relations - always a Spike Lee favorite.  If you're expecting fast-paced action, you'll be disappointed.  Does it deliver as a smart \\"conspiracy\\" film?  Heil, no! <br /> <br />The Inside Man is supposed to be more about a morally bankrupt past than it is about a bank robbery.  However, I found this film to be under whelming and unsatisfying.   It's tries to be a clever story, but it wasn't sharp enough for me.  It's lacks a really meaty story.  The film tries to appeal to your head by being an intelligent thriller but Lee forgot to add in the \\"thriller\\" part.  By the way, you'll know you're watching a Spike Lee film when you see Denzel Washington's character running down the street but in reality, just standing on a rapidly moving platform. Lee has used this idea in some of his previous films. <br /> <br />I rate this film 2.5/5.

0684833395|5.0|My daughter says...<br /><br />The story of Catch-22 opens with the introduction of Captain Yossarian. Captain Yossarian, quirky and extremely paranoid, is the protagonist of the tale. Throughout the story, he is paranoid that everyone around him is trying to kill him. Yossarian's only wish is to fly the required number of missions, seeing as he is an American bombardier during World War II, and return home. However, due to the prideful actions of his Colonel, Yossarian has difficulty fulfilling his goal. Colonel Cathcart continually raises the number of missions his bombardiers have to fly in order to increase his own glory. Catch-22 is an accounting of the actions Yossarian takes to try and escape death, as well as the story of all the interesting, slightly odd, people he meets.<br /><br />When the number of required missions is first raised, Yossarian travels to the Army doctor to try and get the doctor to certify him as insane. However, Doc Daneeka refuses to allow Yossarian to get out of his missions due to the now-infamous Catch-22. According to the army's regulation Catch-22, any soldier who tries to get out of fighting by pleading insanity is showing personal concern. By showing this concern, the person proves himself sane, because insane people don't care about their lives. Men who are truly insane have no trouble flying more missions. However, since the only way to be \\"grounded\\" is to request that you are, and the act of asking implies sanity, no person can get out of flying their missions. Yossarian, therefore, has no choice but to continue to fly the ever-increasing number of required missions.<br /><br />Yossarian, foiled in his attempt to plead insanity, attempts a number of other measures. First, he pretends to have some sort of liver problem and is checked into the hospital. In order to avoid being bored, Yossarian forges the name \\"Washington Irving\\" on a number of the soldiers letters home he is asked to censor instead of writing his official signature. This action leads to a huge problem later on in the book as all the officers try to discover who Washington Irving really is. That problem is only compounded as various other soldiers began copying Yossarian. When he is finally thrown out of the hospital, Yossarian moves a line on a map of Italy to avoid flying a dangerous mission.<br /><br />Through the next section of the book, Yossarian has to deal with the deaths of several of his closest \\"friends.\\" Snowden, the young Nately, and Hungry Joe are all bombardiers like Yossarian who ultimately get caught by one accident or another and die. With these deaths, Yossarian simply refuses to fly any more missions. This has a profound influence on the other soldiers stationed with Yossarian, and they silently begin to support him. Because of this, Colonel Cathcart offers to make a deal with Yossarian. If Yossarian will return back to the states and tell everyone how wonderful his superior officers are, they will let him go home. At first he considers the offer, but then realizing that it would be selling-out his fellow soldiers, Yossarian refuses.<br /><br />Instead, when the chaplain brings Yossarian to the living quarters of Orr, Yossarian realizes that Orr is not lost at sea like everyone believes. Instead, Orr carefully planed his escape by practicing crash landings on every flight he made. This time, instead of returning to the base, Orr had made his was to Sweden. Yossarian decides that he will run away to Sweden and join Orr there so he does not have to continue to risk his life fighting in the war.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br /> Unlike most books about World War II, Catch-22 does not attempt to describe specific battles and provide insight in the course of a war. Rather, it deals with the human interactions that are a part of war. Catch-22 is more than just a war novel, it is a novel about why people act the way they do when put into certain situations. I really enjoyed reading Catch-22.<br /><br />One of themost dominant themes in Catch-22 is that of insanity. In almost every chapter of the book there are examples of people using insane argumentation to make logical points. Catch-22 takes a look at the way people form so-called reasonable assumptions and proves how everyone, it seems, is crazy in their own way.<br /><br />In the very beginning of the book, Yossarian travels to the hospital and meets the army Clergyman. Once he decides that the man is not insane, Yossarian warns him that insanity is contagious, and, indeed, by the end of the book it seems that Yossarian is correct. By the second chapter, Yossarian has determined that war itself is madness. Men fight and die for a crazy notion of patriotism and that doesn't seem to bother anyone. Yossarian's friends think he is crazy because he recognizes the insanity around him, however Yossarian realizes that it is this awareness that will ultimately save his life. Because Yossarian knows he is in constant danger because of those surrounding him, he is prepared to defend himself against anything at any moment.<br /><br />The presence of the Catch-22 itself is a prime example of insanity in the book. It employs insanity to come to an insane conclusion, yet on the surface appears to be a logical chain of reasoning. Even doctors in the book are figures of madness. Yossarian is evaluated by a psychiatrist who determines that he is insane, however, because Yossarian went to the doctor under a different name, the doctor sends a different soldier home even though he knows that person is not the one he diagnosed as crazy.<br /><br />Another example of irrational circular logic occurs when Yossarian proposes to Luciana. Luciana refuses to marry Yossarian because she believes he is insane. She thinks he's insane because he wants to marry her. Luciana tells Yossarian he is crazy, yet she justifies this belief with irrational thinking, proving herself delusional.<br />Perhaps the best irony of the book however, is that Orr, supposedly the craziest of all the men, ends up being the sanest. In the beginning, Orr tells irrational stories and walks around with strange objects in his mouth. He does this so if anyone ever asks him why he has a certain object in his mouth, he can say that he doesn't have that thing in his mouth and pull out something else. He is, of course, utterly sensible in this belief. Orr is also, however, believed to be the luckiest man in the unit, because he is always crashing his plane and making it out alive. In the last chapter of the book, Orr crashes his plane in the ocean and disappears. Yossarian is at first shocked by this news, then stunned, as he realizes that Orr was not actually crazy. Rather, Orr feigned insanity in order to disguise his escape plans. The last time he crashes, Orr went to Sweden instead of simply dying like everyone thought. In the end, Orr used his insanity as his cover, and as his ticket to freedom.<br /><br />Typically, I am not a fan of any book dealing with historical wars. Catch-22 however, caught my interest quickly and held it throughout the book. I would recommend this book to everyone, no matter what kind of genre they usually enjoy.ost every chapter of the book there are examples of people using insane argumentation to make logical points.

B0001UL7RY|1.0|I must admit, if your IQ is lower than 80, than this is the perfect album for you!  If you are in the \\"remedial education\\" class at school, than I'm sure you'll love every second of music that this CD contains.  It's just simple minded music for simple minded people, and nothing more.  Nobody of normal intelligence could ever find any musical value in Avril's bratty, suburban, juvenile delinquent tunes about how much it suc.ks to live in the suburbs.  Hearing a whiney brat like her screaming a bunch of swear words over those noisy guitars turned up louder than a jet aircraft taking off might be entertaining to bratty 10 year olds, but to anybody else, it just sounds loud: loud and irratating.  This isn't really music at all: it's just a noisy, irratating racket.  The guitars are turned WAY, WAY, WAAAAAAAAAYYY up, as loud as possible, and the lyrics aren't sung, but screamed into the microphone in an aggressive manner.  Avril doesn't play anything even remotely passable as music on her guitar: all she does is pound the strings in an aggressive manner.  So to me, this really isn't music at all----it's just a bunch of noise...blaring, mindless, no talent noise.  In fact, I apologise for calling this racket \\"music\\" in the title of this review.  This racket isn't music at all...it's CR@P!
B0001XAPX8|5.0|I have never watched a movie with such amazing performances on all levels.The story,acting and pathos are unrelenting.I am generally a fan of lighter fare,but a big fan of the brilliant Nicole Kidman.If you want a complete theatrical presentation,this movie is for you.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Though having unintentionally missed the film in theatres, I finally got to see Charlie And The Chocolate Factory on it's two disc deluxe edition DVD recently! I never have disliked a Tim Burton film, though I realize that his track record has it's overall ups and down.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film on nearly every level. Being the children's story that it is, I really appreciate the effort to use imagination while not bothering with credible reality at every turn. After all, this is a child's fantasy and doesn`t need to be weighted down with explanations for everything. The entire cast was perfect in every way. Johnny Depp, of course, turned in another very original and unique performance.  Really, what more can be said about this fine actor?  <br /> <br />Of course, the look of the film wasn't a disappointment. This film was visually reminiscent of Burton`s earlier works and succeeded for that very reason. . While I actually am one of the few to enjoy his version of Planet Of The Apes, that film does lack his overall visual signature that I so enjoy and comes across as the least impressive in Burton`s filmography. I love the fact that so much of what is seen in this film is actually real sets as opposed to CGI. Sadly, when CGI is used, it is kind of obvious to me. The opening credits are one such example of the blatantly awful looking animation, though Danny Elfman's score more than makes up for it.  Thankfully, these overdone CGI moments are few and far between.  <br /> <br />I have heard many opinions about the Oompa Loompas in the film as portrayed by actor Deep Roy, opinions that range from good to bad, but I honestly cannot understand why anybody would have a problem here. I thought the Oompas were a highlight of the film and I quite enjoyed their hilarity.  Deep Roy did an amazing job of performing all of the dances and singing all of the lyrics over and over multiple times for the complex visual effects required to pull off the \\"Oompa effect\\". I  also really enjoyed all of the creative songs they performed, put to a wide variety of differing styles  by composer Danny Elfman.  My favorite song was the first one we hear as gluttonous Augustus Gloop gets what's coming to him. Of interest to me was that the lyrics of the songs were straight out of Roald Dahl's book! I think that creating such different songs based on old monologues is amazing in and of itself.  <br /> <br />Another complaint I have heard about the film most commonly in reviews and such is the flashbacks concerning Willy Wonka's father. While this plotline was indeed created for the film, it didn't bother me in the least.  I do not feel that the inclusion of Willy's father in any way hampers the film. Christopher Lee plays Willy's father, and it is always pleasurable to watch this great actor do what he does best. I loved the surreal way these flashbacks were told as well, right down to how a particular building \\"disappears\\" completely. What did I say earlier about a child's imagination and not needing to adhere to reality? It was perfect! Anyhow, I thought the new material worked just fine and helped support the additional material at the end of the film. Speaking of the ending, I liked the new tweaks and additions there as well, for I was never a fan of Charlie winning, flying around in a flying elevator, and never really knowing anything else beyond that moment.  It isn't so much an explanation as it is just taking things a step further, to a more satisfying result. I know the original film reflects how Mr. Dahl wrote it, but after watching the documentary about him on the DVD, I cannot help but think he would have approved of this alteration.  <br /> <br />If I had a complaint about ANYTHING in the film, it would be about the scene in which we see what happened to the other four children after their mishaps in the factory. I very much think their fate was better left to our imagination as opposed to seeing this new addition.  Again, what did I say about the need to explain things?  Well, this scene is delivering in an area that was best left undressed originally, as Willy himself offered enough to let us know that the kids were going to be alright. Of course, this is a merely a small nitpick. <br /> <br />The special features are also worthy of one's time, though I am a bit disappointed that the DVD contains no audio commentary featuring Tim Burton.  With that said, the animated menus are fun, and the documentaries and very informative.  In addition to the very interesting documentary on Mr. Dahl that I mentioned earlier, the disc contains a plethora of other insightful glimpses into the making of the film.  Of particular note is the feature dealing with the squirrels used in the film`s nut cracking room, as well as a detailed feature on the extensive work that went into creating the multitudes of various Oompa Loompas seen throughout the film. Sadly the interactive games included on the discs are disappointing, though aimed at very young children.  Interviews with the director, composer, and actors make for an exciting look into the making of this surreal film.  All in all, a very well put together supplemental package. <br /> <br />I would recommend this film to any who are fans of either the original film starring Gene Wilder in the starring role, or fans of Mr. Dahl's book in general.  If you like interesting documentaries and other supplements on your DVD, waste no time in obtaining the two-disc deluxe edition!  4.5 stars!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing!  <br /> <br />This movie hit me like a shot to the heart.  <br /> <br />It's a beautiful story about deep and genuine love, denied by society.  <br /> <br />How could some - luckily, very few - critics slap the easy tag of \\"gay cowboy movie\\" on this film, I wonder?  <br /> <br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" made me think about my own life, about the force of genuine feelings: those who are lucky enough to find true love in this - short - life should keep it like a treasure because this is ultimately what it counts.  <br /> <br />This film also made me think about the cruelty of some people, and the iniquities that homosexual people have suffered in different parts of the world, in different ages.  <br /> <br />I don't accept some criticism, according to which the characters are immoral because they are homosexual and cheat on their wives. Who said so didn't understand much of this film.  <br /> <br />Ennis has no tools to come to terms with his feelings and sexual attraction to Jack. He was brought up with a sense of horror towards homosexuality, which he considers as an aberrant condition to be ashamed of and repress: this is unfortunately what was taught to him. The social background he comes from doesn't enable him to cope with this situation.  <br /> <br />He literally swallows his feelings and hardly ever expresses them (well, he hardly ever speaks). He desperately tries to forget about Jack and Brokeback Mountain and live a \\"normal\\" life with his wife.  <br /> <br />But, as the movie poster tagline states, love is a force of nature, and you cannot resist to it: why should one's life be hell, just because they received a wrong education, subdued to religious dogmas or social conventions, I wonder? <br /> <br />All the characters, including the two wives, are ultimately unhappy and defeated. But whose fault is it? Ennis's?  <br /> <br />I found his character deeply moving and absolutely realistic.  <br /> <br />Ang Lee's intent, however, is not to deliver a \\"J'accuse\\" movie, but just to recount a tragic and vivid love story between two human beings, like it was in the original Annie Proulx short narrative. <br /> <br />This is Ang Lee's best film by far, and one the best movies I have ever seen; at least, the one which struck me the most.  <br />It may sound pathetic, but I must confess that it's been the very first time I cried for a film... <br />I can't get out of my head its intense images, the laconic, unforgettable lines, its haunting music.  <br /> <br />The pacing is calm: the writer of the original short story, Annie Proulx, and the two screenwriters, McMurtry and Ossana, managed to depict this peculiar and, at the same time, universal American story (which is set in 1963-1983 Wyoming) with few but incisive masterstrokes.  <br /> <br />What makes this movie great is its perfect mixture of strong and poetic images (it's hard to believe they gave the Oscar for best cinematography to \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\"!), its melancholic music, the meaningful silence and facial expressions of the characters, the scarce mighty lines...  <br /> <br />There are no long dialogues: this would have been unrealistic, since it's ultimately two young (and later mature) uneducated cowboys, grown in the narrow spaces of a provincial rural society.  <br /> <br />The actors' performances are absolutely stunning: Heath Ledger is in my opinion the best of all, and it's a real shame he didn't get the awards he deserved! His astounding portrayal of Ennis does smack of loneliness and alienation. <br /> <br />I was very disappointed too when I saw that the Academy Awards didn't give \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" the Oscar as best picture: I think this is outrageous and proves that the Academy Awards do not - too often in my humble opinion - mean quality, but, on the contrary, are just the result of unpredictable marketing strategies or old-fashioned \\"ideologies\\".  <br /> <br />In this case, I think many of the voters acted out their prejudices against a still controversial theme, that is, gay love and homosexuality, in the secret of their voting booths.  <br /> <br />Yet, I am glad this masterpiece received dozens of other accolades, among which the \\"Leone d'Oro\\" (the golden lion) at the Venice Film Festival, back at the film's world premiere in September 2005: being Italian myself, I'm proud we paved the way for such an amazing and moving piece of art. <br />
0380789035|3.0|I'm having a hard time figuring out whether or not I liked this book. I definitely give Gaiman kudos for the subject material, and he does get across several overarching thoughts on today's high-tech, impersonal American culture. But I think the book is lacking on character development.<br />I had absolutely no attachment to any of the characters. The protagonist, Shadow, is lifeless and two-dimensional. There's no reason to like or dislike him and therefore no reason to care what happens to him. Gaiman purposely created him that way for reasons that become clearer later in the book. But I think Shadow is TOO lifeless. I found myself wishing he had at least some kind of personality. Shadow exhibits no reactions to the highly bizarre events taking place around him. Yes, he is hardened and melancholy and ready to give up on life, but you'd think any human being would display some kind of emotion upon discovering that he/she is hanging around a bunch of Old World gods. He's definitely not a character you will remember for very long.<br />I also found the book slightly confusing, with references to arcane gods and rituals that don't make much sense without the proper context. I think there are numerous plot holes, as well, though I don't want to give anything away.<br />That being said, the book moves quickly and is hard to put down, if only to figure out what the heck is going on. And there are several well-executed twists. Gaiman also has a wonderful writing style that makes me want to read his other books. I certainly don't regret reading it but am not sure I would recommend it either.

B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is the definitive Smashing Pumpkins album and one of the finest rock albums of all time for so many reasons:  The entire album consists of two and a half hours of some of the most amazing modern music I have had the privilege of listening to and my only regret is why I didn't fully embrace this album years ago.  Billy Corgan designed this record to be an epic masterpiece after their commercial breakthrough with Siamese Dream, and everything about this album is at its highest quality:  Each and every one of the 28 songs are timeless and can stand for themselves without the support of such a grand concept as Mellon Collie is, and the production is lush with sonic textures, as compared to the raw and grungy Siamese Dream and Gish.  The musical diversity on Mellon Collie is so immense, there's no excuse for any fan of rock to find a handful of songs to become permanently addicted to, unless they are completely disconnected from the modern rock scene.  This album ranks up there with Radiohead's OK Computer and Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation as one of the finest albums to be released in my generation.  If you don't own this album, or haven't had the chance to at least listen to all 28 tracks at least once, you don't know what you're missing.  So be in the know, and buy this album as soon as possible.  THIS IS ESSENTIAL LISTENING FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES ROCK.

B000E33VWW|1.0|If you like art films with talk, talk and more talk.....this is the film for you.  It did not hold my attention and I was asleep within minutes.  I had to rewatch it 4 times before I got through all of it.  Only in the last 30 minutes do we get the Oscar performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  While I agree his performance merited the nomination, I do not believe it was THEE performance of the year.  In a whole word, this movie was dull and boring.  Strictly for the intellectuals who will eat this up.  I just want to be entertained...not bored to death.
B0001XALTG|3.0|The screenwriter did a helluva job. A tough job. He managed to tackle a book that is a gem, but disjointed, disconnected, no real climax/anti-climax/without all the stuff you heard in English class. No saying what comes next, both in the movie and the book. That's what got the audiences' veins pumping.. no pun intended.  <br />The \\"thing\\" about the movie is the liberty it takes, the quality of it, but the point it entirely misses. Admission. You cannot recreate this book. It is a series of stories and people just will not respond to the fact that yes the heroes or antiheroes of the movie are much more than flawed or unflawed. That would be too complicated because the plot is too complicated as is, and they have to strain to get the brogue. (I suggest keeping the book by the can-- a good primer).  <br />But these characters are walking around in a daze. That's the book. They tell their stories, recount episodes, but in reality, hey, no one knows what to do next except hit the pub, the needle, or the first guy you see.  <br />The movie makes Renton and heroin the focus while we get different perspectives--different heroes--in the book. But Trainspotting isn't about just heroin and Rents is a flawed character as are his mates. He is a guy who would really f you over and feel bad about it but still do it. That's reality. That's one of the major lessons that we already know from the book that are glossed over in the movie until the end. Too much Hollywood in the movie?  <br />As I write this I think of how much I thought how cool and stylish the movie was-- and it really is-- and how well acted it was and is. And then how superior the book really is. But all in all, the book shows that addiction brings to the forefront a crisis of morality that is not addressed in the movie. It is simply not addressed, despite the fab ending, and this is a sin.  <br />Addiction is all-encompassing. It becomes the focus of their lives but they have to build lives around it or die. The movie doesn't show it. It's glamor and horror but not the everyday.  <br />All and all, it's a great movie, it's just not the book. I hate writing that but I'll write it again- it's a great movie, it's just not the book.
B000002J2D|5.0|\\"...And Then There Were Three\\" was originally released in March of 1978, and it's the first Genesis album following Steve Hackett's departure from the band in 1977.      Now, don't get me wrong here--I'm not denying Hackett's compositional talent or his distinctive fluid guitar style.  However, many fans have grossly overstated the importance of Steve Hackett's departure from Genesis.  The sound of \\"And Then There Were Three\\" is very, very similar to that of the previous album \\"Wind & Wuthering\\".  Okay, so there aren't any classical guitar spotlights a la \\"Blood On The Rooftops\\" on here, but overall, the albums are very sonically similar, and Hackett just wasn't spotlighted enough on the two previous albums, either compositionally or performance-wise, for his loss to be felt all that much.    Tony Banks, Phil Collins, and Mike Rutherford had such an incredible working relationship and chemistry together, as Genesis' 1978-1991 output monumentally demonstrates, that Hackett's leaving the group was undoubtedly for the best.  That's not to say things wouldn't have been interesting had Hackett stayed.  What seems to be overlooked by most of the fans who accuse Genesis of 'going pop' following Hackett's departure, is that Hackett himself basically 'went pop' in his own right on his 1981 solo album \\"Cured\\".  All that said, it seems obviously clear that Hackett didn't leave Genesis due to them becoming 'too poppy', he left because he felt suffocated by the other guys and wasn't getting enough of his own compositions in.    In any case, \\"...And Then There Were Three\\" finds Genesis brilliantly carrying on without Hackett.  Mike Rutherford was a fine guitarist in his own right, and even Banks played guitar (although not on this album if I understand correctly), so filling in the guitar parts was no big deal.  And either way, you've still got the dense layers of keyboards from Banks and the tremendous drumming from Collins.    The album starts off with the dynamite \\"Down And Out\\".  An icy intro gives way to a frenetic rocker with manical Collins drumming on the verses which are in a 10-4 time signature, giving the song an incredibly powerful, hyperactive feel.  This is heavy duty progressive rock, folks.  The rumor is that the lyrics pertain to Hackett's depature from the band, but it seems to deal more with the band feeling at odds with the 'pop music scene' of the late '70s.    \\"Undertow\\" is one of those wistful, lyrically vivid Banks ballads, with his beloved Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano sound, and a soaring chorus--an absolutely beautiful song.  Also beautiful is Rutherford's spiritually-oriented ballad \\"Snowbound\\", with Collins singing the verses in that incredibly tender, feathery 'little guy' voice that's characteristic of him for this era (although it would forever vanish by the time of 1981's \\"Abacab\\").  The melancholy \\"Many Too Many\\" is marred a tad by overly prominent synth-strings, but it's still undeniably moving, with stirringly emotional choruses; it's surprising that it's a Banks solo composition--it sounds very Rutherford-esque.  And even if you're burnt out on the feel-good radio hit \\"Follow You Follow Me\\", there's no denying it's superbly melodic, and it's neatly enhanced by Rutherford's heavily chorused/ flangered electric guitar.    There's a surprising turn toward Wild West thematics on \\"Ballad Of Big\\" and Rutherford's \\"Deep In The Motherlode\\", great songs, each in the 4 or 5 minute range, with the usual huge hooks and dynamics that we expect from these guys.  The fade on \\"...Motherlode\\" makes effective use of backwards reverb on the drums.  Banks' longer, 7+ minute \\"Burning Rope\\" perhaps drags a tad, but that's splitting hairs--it's darn great, with a terrific intro featuring masterful Collins drum fills.  The sprightly \\"Scenes From A Night's Dream\\" is a wonderfully catchy pop-rock flavored tune, with terrific ringing guitars and ethereal background vocals.    Banks offers another 6+ minute epic with \\"The LadyLies\\".  It's a story-song somewhat along the lines of the previous album's \\"All In A Mouse's Night\\".  The lyrics, about a femme fatale, are fairly lame and highly obvious, but the music is a different story...  The verses are naturally sly and insinuating, and this is contrasted with an absolutely gorgeous chorus, plus there's a spine-tingling mid-section with a great Banks solo spot.    All in all, despite some minor gripes here and there, I can hardly say enough positive things about \\"...And Then There Were Three\\".  This is the start of an unparalled streak of musical brilliance from the Banks-Collins-Rutherford lineup of Genesis.
0060723513|5.0|The \\"message\\" of this book calls us to examine the western culture we have created and decide if it really does bring happiness. The author thinks not, and in her story submerges an American in an Aboriginal culture for 3 months to show the differences. The story is fascinating, and the conclusion is that the indigenous culture providing for peoples' emotional needs above physical needs, whereas our western culture is just the opposite. There was criticism when this book was published that many of the facts about the lives of the Aborigines were erroneous, but the book is fiction. I am sure the author made up a lot of the details and since it's fiction that's fine. Making a factual account of a 3 month walkabout was not the claim of the book - comparing two radically different  social environments and drawing conclusions from that comparison was the intent. Very thought provoking; I highly recommend it to any socially aware reader.
B00005JO04|5.0|Clooney is using the hot mdium that the cinema is to demonstrate through his editing and his various shooting techniques a very simple idea, or rather network of ideas. First, the USA are only interested in oil and natural gas in the Middle East and Central Asia, and they have to face Chinese competition, so all means are good to get rid of that menace. Second, the USA will use all their power, military included, to set up governments in the Middle East countries with leaders who will favour them, even if they are absolutely unable to govern and manage their countries. Third, all leaders or would-be leaders who want to invest the oil revenue in building a sustainable economy and a sustainable political democracy in their countries are enemies who have to be eliminated by all means. Finally this creates some resentment among the Moslems, some frustration to be poor when there is so much money going around, and some desire to re-establis God's law in their countries and in the world by pushing away these American and Western invaders, hence the readiness for these to sacrifice their life in a flash of lightning in order to destroy this machine that is crushing the Moslem world into a pitiful state, into slavery and sinful perversion. In the end the only winners, short-term winners mind you, are the oil companies and the oil industry tycoons. But how long will this fable and fantasy go on and last ? There the film stops and we have to supplement the pictures with our own conviction. A dramatic, tragic and enlightening masterpiece.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne
0767903862|5.0|This is the first Bill Bryson book that I read. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It was so funny that I would laugh out loud. It was interesting to read about someone's travels but not in a traditional manner. Sounds like Bill would make for a great travel companion. I've read some of his other books since then, but this remains my favorite.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This guy has a future! I admire and respect the way John plays guitar, particularly his soulful tone. It's not a simple thing to transit from a commercial oriented album to a solid blues trio album, but Mr. Meyer, among other few musicians is capable to do so. Personally, I would rather prefer the bluesy-style Meyer to the rock-pop oriented Meyer, but still enjoy both. The rhythm section is simple great with Jordan and Paladino on drums and bass, respectively. This album is already a classic.

In fact, I was laughing pretty much at every page. I even used the first two pages as my oral reading in my Speech class and the whole class was cracking up.  <br /> <br />The concept is great, the excution is awesome and the ride along the way is full of colorful characters, wicked humor and deep thought. Well, only if you REALLY think about what they're saying.

B00005JOUM|4.0|OK, forgive me here while I stretch my female sense of incredulity. Denzel Washington. And. Clive Owen. In one movie. Give me a portable fan and some smelling salts and let me revel in two of my favorite \\"guys\\" on the big screen. ..... All right, I'm calm now. Time to review.<br /><br />Denzel Washington has made all too many movies that start out the same....just another tale, with Denzel being competent and cool, and the film being somewhat provocative, but somewhat forgettable. \\"Inside Man\\" starts out like that. It seems predictable, but it rapidly becomes something else.<br /><br />The big attraction here is Spike Lee who has been better lately, as an actor (in the documentary....\\"Through the Fire\\"), than as a director in recent years (\\"She Hate Me\\" (?) \\"Sucker Free City\\" (?); give me strength!). His \\"25th Hour\\" was passable; self-indulgent, slow, poorly edited -- and with a cast to die for (Ed Norton, P.Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper, Anna Pacquin, Rosario Dawson, New York City!), Lee shoulda done better. Shoulda, coulda, did, finally with this film. Lee found his screenwriter (a rookie) and his editor for \\"Inside Man\\", and they are both forces to be reckoned with. And what a cast he rounded up!<br /><br />The movie's complex, it flashes, moves, unnerves you with the fact that you can't figure it out. Clive Owen is holding up a bank and seems forced to take hostages. The hostages are clothed the same as Clive's gang. Now, who is hostage and who is robber? Is he really there to rob the bank, or did he have another agenda? Owen is Dalton Russell and he's about to pull a bait and switch on everyone else.<br /><br />Dalton's foil is the hostage negotiator, you guessed it, Washington, as a man with other places he'd rather be.

He's daunted by Dalton, but who is the cat, and who is the mouse?<br /><br />Once you add the smarmy Christopher Plummer (just as good as he was in Syriana) who owns the bank and is clearly more worried about some secret that is in danger, and his agent provacateur, Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to the mix, you're swimming in talent, plot and cattiness. Foster provides a lot of barbs, a quick, cutting wit, and the ice that a certain former First Lady is famous for.<br /><br />And, if you're like me, the truth about the robbery will begin to dawn on you just as the film begins to close, and you'll be glad you plunked down your $8 to see a fine, really fine Spike-Denzel-Clive and the gang film. A film that involves you; a film that makes you sit up and take notice. A film that puts Spike Lee back on the map.<br /><br />It's not award-winning, but I've got to give \\"Inside Man\\" a 4 star rating, for the sheer enjoyment of it all!/> <br />Once you add the smarmy Christopher Plummer (just as good as he was in Syriana) who owns the bank and is clearly more worried about some secret that is in danger, and his agent provacateur, Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to the mix, you're swimming in talent, plot and cattiness.

0763627410|5.0|It seems that early childhood classrooms find themselves transformed into oceans or fish tanks at least once a year, since there is undeniable pleasure in illustrating the movement and coloration of swimmy beings, and a whole lotta books about ocean life for inspiration. Nonetheless, Lucy Cousins offers a bold, fresh title to children and teachers in Hooray for Fish! with illustrations that capture the wonderful differentness of fish and descriptive language that begs to be repeated and replicated in the classroom and at home.<br /><br />The length and language are well suited for 3-4 year old whole group interest level, and will allow a lot of repeat reads to search for details in the text and illustrations. Teachers can rely on this book to generate lots of ideas for language activities and art projects, while they might look to Fish Eyes by Lois Ehlert to incorporate math ideas. The hardcover is oversized, great for reading aloud or filling up a lap or two in the classroom library.<br /><br />One glance at the cover brings me joy, so I hope Cousins is hard at work on another winner for the preschool audience.
B00005JLYW|2.0|The only reason why I gave it two stars is because, I like Drew Berrymore and Demi Moore as actresses.  I happen to be over my brother's visiting, when my niece and sister-in-law was watching this mess.   <br /> <br />Yes! We know it's suppose to be a campy chick flick of the T.V. show and not to be taken seriously, but they could have done much better with the casting and the movie as a whole. Instead, we get this Matrix/Batman wannabe, flying off the bridge, too many cameos B.S.   This movie was a disaster, and did a serious unjustice to the original series.   <br /> <br />Since, we all grew up in the seventies watching shows like Swat, Starsky & Hutch, the Rookies and of course this, me and my sister-in-law, was discussing is, why the studios just didn't make this into a more dramatic feature film with a better cast?   <br /> <br />I like you Drew and Demi, but I feel both of you just, didn't fit these roles.  As far as Camron Diaz and Lucy Lou  <br />(and they are not all that) What were they smoking when they decided to cast them?  Neither one of them (in my opinion) is  NOT HOT!!!  I mean, dam!  Both of them are so caked with  <br />make-up, their faces look 3-D.  They don't turn this man's head twice at all, their looks are average at best, so enough about them already. <br /> <br />What I was about to say earlier is, what they should have done is, taken the original characters from the T.V. show (Jill, Sabrina and Kelly) recast them with Hollywood's better more mature looking actresses, for example the so-called it girl today I guess, you know?  Someone like Angelina Jolie, could have been cast as the new Kelly Garrett.  Of course every  <br />Anglo-Saxon red blooded male has to have his \\"Blonde Bombshell\\" so what the hell!  Why not the new Farrah of the 90's back then, Miss Pamela Anderson as the new Jill Monroe?  The character is practically tailer made for her.   <br /> <br />This might sound a little controversial, not making this out to be a race issueeither, but even though Charlie's Angeles didn't have a black angel, I think Halle Berry could have pulled it off cast as the new Sabrina Duncan.  If not her, than Katerine Zeta Jones.  BOOM!!!  There's your stars for the new Charlie's Angeles feature film, that should have been cast that way, several years ago, if the movie studios were serious about making this a good dramatic movie. <br /> <br />But, forget it, the damage is done now, so we're stuck with Miss Berrymore and these two other goofy looking, clown acting, not even qute actresses.  I'll be honest here, you young turks can rave about them all you want to (each to its own), but Diaz and Lou just don't cut it for me.  Not only that, but they both became more annoying to me through out the middle of the movie for some reason.   <br /> <br />I think I lost interest in this junk somewhat, after Jacklyn Smith cameo apperance.  She still looks pretty good, to be honest she was the only high light(literally) to me of the movie.        <br /> <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|When you walk into a theater that holds the title BATMAN BEGINS, you better believe that that movie better accomplish or at least surpass the original. Many people have seen the 1989 version of BATMAN but there are some who thirsted for a deeper knowledge of how bruce wayne became the dark knight. Talk about thrist bein' quenched! This movies re-introduces you to bruce wayne, re-telling his dark event that made him, delving deeper into the history of wayne enterprises, giving the butler more of a character, and shows you how batman got all his cool gadjets, and taking you through the first adventures of the batman. This movie is a perfect collection to a great movie collection. Christopher nolan, director of MEMENTO, really outdoes himself in this one. Oh, and the scarecrow! Fans, believe me, you won't be dissapointed!
B000B2YQX4|4.0|What I like the most about DM is that they are still evolving, even after more than 20 years. I find quite a few number of songs in this album remarkable, and as good examples of this evolution. There a couple ones though, that would have been better left out.. Nevertheless, this is another outstanding DM album, showing how a band can evolve from the 80's new wave era to \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" and then to \\"Playing the Angel\\"
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Well I am a huge Joss Whedon fan, love him and Buffy/Angel BUT I never once watched Firefly while it was on the air.  I honestly assumed it would be on for more than one season but shame on me.  When I saw the movie was coming out I saw it for the sake of seeing something by Joss Whedon on the big screen but initially I had to agree with Frogger's review on the downsides. <br /> <br />Then a friend recommended I actually watch the series before opening my big mouth.  Once I did a lot of pieces fell into place.  So, as not to ruin the fun, this movie is good for all Joss Whedon fans or fans of Buffy or Angel BUT you should try to track down someone with the Firefly series so that you aren't confused by seemingly random characters.  If you watch the show the only character that really is just there for the purpose of getting things going and not anywhere in the series is Mr. Universe.. blah. :) I do have to add that you can watch it and it will make sense without having seen the show but watching it does help. <br /> <br />The movie was a nice way to answer most of the questions that the show left you wondering about when it went off the air.
0596009208|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. I bought the Head First book on design patterns and love it.  It was the right mix of irreverance and information. So, I bought this book even though I have been a Java developer for over 5 years. I was excited to see how the Head First authors handled a beginners book for Java.<br /><br />Not too well, in my opinion. Chapter Three, in particular, was a mess. This chapter introduces the notion of variables yet never explains what an integer variable is. No explanation is given of the float type. We are told that a byte holds 8 bits...but not told what a bit is.  We are not told how to assign a hexadecimal value to an int. We are not told that if we assign a numeric value with a leading zero...the compiler will assume that you meant to use octal values. The reader is not told that Strings are immutable. These are all things that will trip up a beginner (the target market for this book). The author of this chapter doesn't even bother to mention that a Java array uses a zero-based index.<br /><br />Both primitives and the notion of classes are introduced in Chapter Three. Yet, the author doesn't mention that all primitives (except boolean) have wrapper classes. Strings are introduced...but, no mention is made of the StringBuffer or StringBuilder (very useful and often used classes). These items are included in the back of the book in Appendix B.<br /><br />There are so many things left out that I wonder if the publisher  actually had any beginners read this book.  Readers of this book will finish this book still ignorant of many Java essentials.<br /><br />Here is one of their dumbed-down explanations for an object reference:<br /><br />\\"Think of a Dog reference variable as a Dog remote control. You use it to get the object to do something (invoke methods). An object reference is just another variable value. Something that goes in a cup. Only, this time, the value is a remote control.\\"<br /><br />Huh?  Granted, they had been using the\\"cup\\" metaphor before...but, still I found this book confusing, superficial, and somewhat insulting.  It felt like reading a children's Weekly Reader book.  (It even has crossword puzzles)<br /><br />I like the idea of making learning fun. However, in their attempt to make it fun they left out so much info which is pertinent to the beginning Java programmer. Apparently, another rule of the Head First series is that there MUST be a cute picture on every page. Many times, the logical flow of text is hindered because they had to fit a non-illuminating, unnecessary graphic on the page.  Many of the pictures are unnecessary and do not help to explain the content at all.  Many paragraphs are confusing, unclear, or simply badly structured.  The editors were asleep on this one.<br /><br />Many newbies are giving this book high marks. Unfortunately, they are woefully ignorant of the fact that this book left out a ton of info that is pertinent to actually coding Java well.  One poster here raves that he was able to cover 60 pages in one day.  In my opinion...ease of reading is not the only criteria for a good programming book.<br /><br />My recommendations for Java beginners: Beginning Java by Ivor Horton or Core Java by Cay Horstmann.
B000006XSD|5.0|I have this Album on original vinyl, and I love the thing. The mickey spellane novel motif is an interesting image for Alice. Idk if the CD is the same, but on the inner record sleeve, it shows Alice wearing white shirt and tie,and a black fedora, loading what seems like a .38 revolver, with an unfiltered cigarette in his mouth, makes him look that much bad ass. The songs are great, and this album in general is one of Alice's finest in my eyes.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Shave about half an hour off of the hour-and-twenty worth of character development, and this is a solid piece of entertainment.  The leads make the first half of the movie watchable, and once the big man himself gets into the picture (Kong, that is.  Not Jack Black) it's non-stop till the last frame.  The effects are mind-blowing (particularly the brontosaurus stampede), the set-pieces are expertly timed and delivered (the insect pit delivers the kind of full-body-shivers we haven't had since Indiana Jones), and the Empire State Building climax is truly dizzying and spectacular. <br /> <br />Mr. Jackson may have gone a little overboard on the Getting-To-Know-You's of this one, but the ultimate payoff is well worth it. <br /> <br />PS - heed the PG-13 warning.  Definitely some elements that'll give the young ones nightmares (very big, very realistic bugs--and lots of 'em).
0345457684|5.0|Takeshi Kovacs has inherited somebody else's body. This former special UN Envoy--basically a solider without a conscience-- now does business as a private investigator and he's beem hired to find out who killed the super wealthy Laurens Bancroft. Oh and he's been hired by the resurrected Bancroft himself. Bancroft has himself digitally backed up every 48 hours. There's no more true death unless you're Catholic or have the cortical stack that they use to pull digital copies out of destroyed. The police are convinced that Bancroft committed suicide.<br /><br />Kovacs is from Harlan's Planet and has been sleeved, i.e., temporarily placed in the body of someone who has been convicted of crimes and now the state owns their body and can loan it out any time. He has a limited time in the San Francisco Bay Area (now called Bay City)or he gets put back in the digital store house. When someone comes after Kovacs he's pretty sure that it's related to his investigation but things become complicated as he finds out more about the body he's occupying.<br /><br />A fascinating combination of mystery/noir crime thriller and science fiction, Richard Morgan's first novel won the Philip K. Dick Award for Best novel in 2003. It deserves it. The themes of identity that were common to Dick's novels and the style seen here isn't unlike Dick's work in novels like Do Andriods Dream of Electric Sheep?--the basis for \\"Blade Runner\\"-- (although admittedly the writing style is more Raymond Chandler than Dick). Well written, literate with fascinating characters ALTERED CARBON perfectly combines different pulp styles and Kovacs comes across as a combination of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe with more sex and violence for our 21st century world.<br /><br />Morgan's done a great job of imagining Earth in the future and the details of the novel are well thought out. Recently purchased by producer Joel Silver (\\"The Matrix\\") to be made into a movie, I'm not sure how good a translation to the screen this will make and can only hope that they'll do a credible translation to the screen.<br /><br />Recommended.ly hope that they'll do a credible translation to the screen.     Recommended.
B00008WT5E|5.0|At the 'Summer Jam' in '78, AC/DC was booked as the supporting act under headliners Aerosmith and Van Halen. AC/DC upstaged them both and proved themselves a force to be reckoned with! This CD is considered by many to be their \\" most accomplished in studio performance\\". It's not 'Highway to Hell', but it's damn close. Produced by George Young (older brother to Ang and Mal)and Harry Vanda, they once again get the best from the band in all their fury. This album also marks the debut of Cliff Williams on Bass. (What did happen to Mark Evans,anyway?) As Bon Scott himself once said, \\"There's been an audience waiting for an honest rock n roll band to come along and lay it on 'em\\".  <br />From the opening track (Now a classic) 'Rock N Roll Damnation' to the awesome 'Sin City' to 'Riff Raff' this CD rocks and rocks very hard. It's also blusey and full of bite. The deluxe remastered version is amazing, with never before seen color photos from the tour. Alot of the tracks on this one are heard again on 'If you want Blood (you got it) except they are LIVE!  <br />A milestone for the fans and the band, 'Powerage' is a true legendary album.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Like many others, I wondered what effect the passage of time would have on Donald Fagen, but I'm happy to report that he's in fine form on this release. Hard for a mere mortal to follow up an amazing debut such as the 'Nightfly', but I'd rate this its near equal in many ways. More real instruments (even a harmonica, which, btw, works perfectly), a more organic feel to the band and a growing sense of 'approachability\\" in his lyrics. Highly recommended for people who like multi layered music that grows with each listen.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I ran to theatres when Pride and Prejudice first came out, later on bought the movie and have watched it about hundred times. Although the story doesn't exactly follow the book (otherwise the movie would be MUCH longer), the major themes and elements are put into the movie in a stunning way. As for the scenery, the countryside and Pemberley were amazing (I want to go there!), and the actors were very believable, especially Lizzy and Mr. Darcy. I'm a tiny bit disappointed that they didn't put something between Lizzy's running out the door and them together and Pemberley (like a clip of marriage?), but otherwise the film was amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves soppy romance stories... like me. :)
0060853964|4.0|Good Omens is a truly hilarious combination of folklore, fantasy and religion with a delightful twist of modern thinking. The book's authors, Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, did a very good job of incorporating as much humor into the story as possible. Of course, since they are both English born, its mostly British humor, but it's still enjoyable none the less. Together they split the story into as many different character view points as possible. Each chapter recaptures your interest because it revolves around the life of a totally different character. This is nice because the characters change so often, you don't even get the chance to get board with one of them. They also personified the concepts of history, society and religion in such creative ways that make it very difficult to put the book down. For these two authors, everything's a joke worth telling. Throughout the story you really can't predict what's going to happen next. As soon as you think you know what's going on, the plot is morphed and turned upside down. With each passing chapter the authors slowly reveal more and more about the characters and the fate of the world. But none of this can prepare you for the final conclusion, which is nothing anyone would have expected.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Many may find my review \\"prejudiced\\" due to my being an avid fan of the book, the 1939 version and the BBC 1995 version - but I urge you to carefully consider the reasons for my EXTREMELY LOW opinion of the 2005 production below:    1. I call it a \\"production\\" rather than an \\"adaptation\\" because this movie in no way resembles the spirit, the cleverness, nor the principle of the book. Jane Austen wrote a story based on the social conventions of her day and interlaced her descriptions of the setting, the characters and their behaviors with the amused observations of a woman who sharply recognizes the dynamics of human interaction shrouded behind the cloak of manners. This book, in fact, is described as being a masterful \\"comedy of manners\\", and is celebrated as such along with all Jane Austen works. Pride and Prejudice (the book) is a triumphant social commentary of what lies beneath the manners of upper and middle class English people - the comedic, the sweet, the nasty, the ambitious, the heart-broken...and the passionate. This production took liberties with the time period (changing it from late 19th century to the late 18th century), thereby taking Austen's nuanced observations of social mores during her time completely out of the equation. Then, to add insult to injury, the film makers did not bother to make any commentary of their own regarding the social dynamics of that time. With this, they completely broke the spirit of the book.    2. Elizabeth Bennett as a character in the book represents the intelligence, the spirit and the liveliness of Jane Austen herself during her time. Many of the witty observations of the character were completely lost in translation within the 2005 production. Keira Knightly did a fine job at playing the character she was given, but this Elizabeth Bennett is decidedly NOT the beloved character that was so finely crafted by its original author. I wouldn't be surprised if the actress eventually admits to playing this version with a heavy heart (not to mention Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland, Jena Malone and Judi Dench - if they, as any truly literary person, read the original story, they would be scandalized with this production's one-note view of their characters as well).    3. The dialogue was atrociously tampered with within this production. Much of the important, clever, witty and profound dialogue found within the book was ruthlessly cut in favor of the film makers desire to present sweeping landscapes of the pristine English countryside. Is this the commentary that they longed to make in this film? That the cinematography (along with the swells of music as the stags ran by) is even more beautiful and more noteworthy than the characters themselves?!!! If I took the time to count the frames of film that were allocated towards such non-consequential footage, I'm sure I'd find that a good 70% of the movie was spent staring at the sun over a mountainside. Capital offense! Then, the film makers presumed to add their own dialogue - and it was an inept attempt at that. The dialogue added was flat, simple and inartistic - designed to \\"spell out\\" the unfolding of the story's events. This was a clear indication of the film makers lack of confidence in the literary sensibilities of today's moviegoers - instead of presenting a witty, masterful and intelligent version we can all get behind, they delivered a watered-down, dreary version that is pumped full of romantic, visual imagery.    4. This production, quite simply, dishonors the spirit of Jane Austen. The film makers had no intention of honoring, or celebrating the brilliance of this author's work - instead they sought to exploit it to pack as many Austen fans (through the shameless promotion of this film as being an \\"adaptation\\") and Keira Knightly fans into the theaters as possible. They repackaged the original story as a sweeping romantic drama in a veiled attempt to capitalize on the \\"Titanic\\" angle, and put their own \\"youthful\\" spin on a classic by making the characters exhibit attitudes and behaviors that are more like the young people of today. Rather than mannerly and dignified, the youthful characters in this production are sullen, caustic, petulant and self-absorbed. There was absolutely no room for subtlety when conveying their thoughts, opinions and emotions. Yet another unforgivable digression from the classic Austen version.    I could go on and on about the dissatisfaction with this 2005 production, but I think the points made above will do. Those who truly want to learn more about the fantastic story upon which this production is supposedly based, I recommend reading the reviews of the Jane Austen book and eventually, when time allows, reading the book itself. And as far as a film adaptation goes, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the BBC production - one that truly honors Jane Austen and is in keeping with the spirit of the book...and the spirit of the author.
0066620996|4.0|This is a better book than I first thought it was.  On re-reading it, I realized that Collins was actually restating the principles set forth in Sun Tzu's Art of War:  The devil really is in the details - those who tend to be successful are those who have the best understanding of the business at hand and have the courage to do what it takes to get the job done right. <br /> <br />This book may be destined to be a classic, but it only builds on a tradition of applying rational principles to unravel what appears to be complex situations.  It doesn't break new ground.  Collins is not a Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, Smith, Riccardo, Samuelson or Friedman, but he does a good job of showing how new challenges can be met by the application of intelligence and hard work.
1594200440|5.0|When the Ukranian narrator's 84 year old father goes borderline senile and falls head-over-heels in love with a young voluptuous gold-digger, lots of hilarious plotting ensues among his two daughters to dissuade the marriage.<br /><br />What follows is some delectable social satire and a healthy dollop of irony in a style redolent of the Milan Kundera of yore. The author's reminiscing about an eastern Europe life of not too distant past ('to survive is to win') is as entertaining as it is informative. Characters are sketched with warmth and wit. The prose is effortless, and it never gets indulgent despite its pithy social commentary.<br /><br />At the heart of the story are the many problems that urban emigres face but seldom confront. What do we with people we are *supposed* to like but don't trust or understand? To what extent is our identity based on our history? Can we escape it? If trapped by our pasts, can we spin our own personal meanings?<br /><br />The title may escape the unvigilant, but it is emblematic of the author's poky metaphors. A tractor--ordinarily a very constructive, peaceful vehicle--can be readily transformed into a tank during times of strife. Which is a lot like us humans morphing into our resilient selves against the muddle of difficult lives. I feel that somewhere at the heart of this clever novel lies the wistful idea that if the world could be run by grown-ups, tanks could just as easily be turned back into tractors.<br /><br />A fascinating read, so accessibly written you could gulp it in one sitting.
0066620996|5.0|As a member of our local school board, I bought this book in search of ways to improve our school.  As I read the book, I kept thinking things like, 'now that makes sense' and 'I never thought about it that way but it works'!  School boards face constrictions that do not apply in industry or business and that limits some application of the principles in this book.., For example, we can't just fire someone because we determine they are not the 'right person'.  We can, however, use the principles in this book in a long term plan to 'get the right people on the bus', and to 'stop doing the things that don't work'.  I was particurlarly interested in the description of a level 5 manager.  How many school superintendents or principals have you known that could be described as 'self effacing'?  The book is a good read with wider implications than just business.
B000E97HIA|4.0|After lemons like Musicology and that quirky instrumental endeavor with 14 minute jams, it is good to see Prince treading back to his classic roots of funky pop. About time.<br /><br />As an album, 3121 has its eccentric feet planted in the past. From the sizzling trippy-hop funk of 'Lolita' or 'Black Sweat', to the raggedy punk rock of '3121' or 'Fury', to the silken jazzy undertones of 'Te Ame Corazon' or 'The Dance', to the ballad goodness of 'Satisfied', this should satisfy the most devout of Prince aficionados.<br /><br />A new-fangled sound experience it may be not, but it is the most versatile riff to come out of this troupe in years. You won't be disappointed if you dig your funk and have been known to like Prince in the past.
B000E97HIA|5.0|we get a taste of old school prince meeting new school.  you get to go back to the written, arranged, Composed, and Performed by PRINCE with a little help from some friends (i am so glad michael bland is back).  there is that nasty side groove that we haven't heard in a while(Incense and Candles) and those screams that you remember from the purple rain days(the dance).  i'll say it, i like it.
B000002J29|5.0|When this album first came out I wasn't too familiar with a lot of earlier Gabriel Genesis- Mostly Collins first 2 outstanding efforts. So I found myself skipping to songs that seemed to fit that category. With my exposure to Genesis broadened over time, and after seeing them live for the first time on the \\"Duke\\" tour, my appreciation for this CD and their live experience was solidified. The hooks in their music whetted my appetite for further sampling their earlier efforts and my love for the entire CD was entrenched, moreso once I finally got a quality sound system for the first time in my life to experience the finer nuances of their songs. And the song selection is superb. The performances by all band members, including their well traveled sessionists, outstanding. Once you've seen them live and experience a drum duet between Phil Collins and Chester Thompson you hear this CD with significantly more appreciation and goose bumps. And Collins' performances of songs put out during Gabriel's years doesn't miss a beat. Indeed, he delivers them flawlessly while leaving his own stamp on them. This is the stronger live CD when compared to \\"Three Side Live,\\" released not too far after \\"ABACAB,\\" in both sound quality (especially with the remastering) and song selection. And that's coming from one whose fandom was grown between \\"Trick of the Tail\\" and \\"Invisible Touch,\\" which the latter live CD reflected more in content. Though no live CD ever is the same as seeing the band in concert- missing from the audio of \\"I Know What I Like\\" is the visual acrobatics Collins performs in his tambourine solo- \\"Seconds Out\\" more truly reflects the style, power, and cohesiveness that was a live Genesis concert. This is my favorite live CD of any band, though admittedly my taste for live recordings has dwindled in favor of the studio versions over time. Most live recordings try to over sensationalize for the sake of promoting tours or other CDs. While this one may result in the latter, it's because it so accurately frames this band's reputation as one of the best live concerts over the past three to four decades. The only thing missing is the light show that Genesis became renowned for.
0451529308|2.0|I read this book a long time ago and absolutely hated it. Then someone recommended Louisa May Alcott to me so I gave it another shot, but by the end I was truly wondering why Little Women had become such a classic. I found that the first half was lacking in plot - when I looked back on it I realized that I had spent at least a couple hours reading about a ball, a sickness, and a bad dinner - and that the second half had far too much plot. The first part was very hung up on morality and sometimes felt too pious, although Marmee was a remarkably enlightened woman. The characters, especially Meg, didn't feel distinct and realistic throughout the second half; I felt like the three years that had passed distanced me from the characters. Attempting to jam three romances, a death, and a storyline involving Jo's writing into the second part only made things feel more detached. As for the aforesaid romances, I tried desperately to find the emotional reasoning behind Jo's choice and came up empty handed. The one thing that saved this book was the simple language and writing; I found it easy to read. <br />In short, I'm sure that this book appeals to some, but I didn't like at 7 and I don't like it now. I definitely agree with the people that recommended Anne of Green Gables instead - it and its sequels are great books.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Porcupine Tree have perfected the art of mixing different musical ambitions into a cohesive and coherent sound, in a skillful fashion that defines the very term \\"progressive rock.\\" This music is not merely progressive as a style or genre, but progressive in its very substance and construction. Head honcho Steven Wilson's songwriting philosophy, and the band's fearsome musical chops, are nearly impossible to classify or categorize. And that's a good thing. The band is clearly devoted to the classic prog-rock sounds of bands like King Crimson, Pink Floyd, and Rush, but adds to this foundation with adventures into other realms, in ways that are not the least bit forced or awkward. After a show of jawdropping slow-burn musicianship in the opening title track, this album leads into the riff-heavy prog-metal crusher \\"Shallow,\\" which then somehow segues believably into the quiet folkish balladry of \\"Lazarus.\\" Sly funk grooves mix seamlessly with orchestral rock in \\"Halo,\\" while \\"Open Car\\" combines twisted art metal with soaring pop choruses. The centerpiece of the album is obviously the twelve-minute monster \\"Arriving Somewhere (but Not Here)\\" which relentlessly unfolds many layers of sonic drama and emotion, culminating in a killer middle coda that is nearly death metal in nature, but remarkably adds even more to the organic beauty of the rest of the song. And even though I have mentioned many different musical genres here, you will be amazed by Porcupine Tree's ability to combine them all flawlessly into a sound that is all their own.

B000BB1MIC|5.0|First let me say that I love this show. It's smart, funny, and always entertaining. But I thought that Season 5 was lacking some of that spirit that I loved about the first few seasons. I definitely disagree with the commonly accepted thought that Season 4 was a transition season, understandably a little weak, etc etc, and that Season 5 took the show back to it's beginnings. Personally, I don't find Season 5 at all nostalgic or reminiscent of the early Gilmore Girls days. [SPOILERS below] <br />My biggest complaint is the amount of sex in this season. Something I always liked about the show was how clean it was, even in Season 3 when Rory introduced the subject of possibly sleeping with Jess and Lorelai's frequent insertions of \\"Ooh, dirty!\\". I understand that the show needs to mature, along with Rory and with its original teenaged audience, but personally, there were several times during this season when I was uncomfortable to be watching with my younger sister. <br />I also thought that some of the loose ends needed to be tied up a little bit better. Dean just dropped out of Rory's life - after he had pined for her and then proceeded to cheat on his wife for her, he just walked away. Jackson was elected town selectman and presided over a town meeting - and then Taylor does not call a recall election like he said, instead he acts like nothing is wrong and is back handling the town museum and Luke's house purchase. I also felt Sookie's pregnancy could have been much more momentous than it was. <br />On the plus side, Richard and Emily's seperation and reconciliation was handled well, as was Rory's process of falling for Logan. This season had some great moments: Kirk singing \\"Do You Love Me?\\" during Fiddler on the Roof was priceless. <br />I don't know if watching Season 6 will give me new perspective on where the writers were heading when they wrote the episodes in Season 5. I still adore this show, but I have a feeling that my disc sets of Seasons 2 and 3 will seea lot more use than Season 5 will.

0953104907|5.0|This book answered all the questions I had about building an electric guitar. It lays out all the basic measurements you need including Scale Lengths, Neck and Head sizes, nut and bridge sizes, etc. And it tells you what you need to know to modify each of these to make the guitar your own. If you have no idea how to work with tools and wood you should start with a Wood Working book, But if you have basic knowledge of wood working this book will tell you every thing you need to know to use that knowledge to build your very own and hopefully Original Guitar.

I was not let down as some of the details and specifically the difficult logistics of operations was layed out and described. All this without the technology that we have today for satellite communication/Internet etc. Superb description of the Apollo 11 landings and mindset for success of the Apollo 13 events, showing the stunning and legendary team building abilities and decision making insites of the period. Worth reading for anyone interested in those years of Space Exploration.
B000E97HIA|5.0|All I really need to say is this CD is HOT! But I want to say more. :) His Musicology CD was a 3-4 star CD, this is a fiver! Prince is back and its a nice welcome that XM Radio already added to some stations.  Thank God for satellite radio, commercial FM is nearly non-existent these days.  Prince's voice is fresh, unlike the tired sounding Madonna on \\"Confessions\\", and the music is pure funk.  He looks like he has only aged about two years in his 3121 video as seen on VH-1 compared to the 1980's. This must be the best Prince album since his famous \\"Purple Rain\\".  At first I wasn't  thrilled with the song \\"Black Sweat\\" but now its one of my favorites that I listen to at the gym.  Now I'm hoping that an extended remix of it is released.  So if you are an older fan that would say \\"I like early Prince\\" or a new fan, trust me, This CD is not to be missed.  LOVE IT!  BEST CD of 2006!
0887306667|3.0|If you're in marketing chances are you already know most of the stuff in this book. (Although he gives examples of a few rules that even the best of the best frequently break)-so you still might learn something yourself. But I think the best use of this book is to show to a boss or client who THINKS they know about marketing and really don't know jack. Anybody in marketing knows that coming up with the idea is only half the job, you then have to sell the idea to the powers that be.  <br />My suggestion, make them read the book. It's very very short.  <br />And it might save you some headaches.  <br />Ironically, my boss suggested I get the book for both of us on the recommendation of a friend. When I read it I thought, well, I didn't learn too much from it myself but thank God he's going to read it because it says everything I've been trying to get into his thick head. If you have the same problem, buy it and put it on their desk. Save yourself the trouble.

6305949980|4.0|The music and the storyline are excellent; however, the animation/puppets and scenery/imagery is a bit dark and may not appeal to some. Little ones may find it scarey. Parents, watch first, then determine if your child should view it. It may cause nightmares in the very young (5 and under). It is one of my favorites, along with \\"Corpse Bride\\" as I enjoy the story and sets far better than most of the entertainment today.
0679422714|5.0|Clearly not a \\"neutral\\" biography, this story of infamies is totally convincing. One wonders what the defense team might come up with. So far, what I have read in the other reviews, from those who gave low ratings, is not really to the point.<br />The main theme for me, having myself witnessed the phase of Mao's \\"going global\\" via the little red book and attracting blind followers for a while in romantic circles in Europe, is the total absence of a basis of \\"good intentions\\". Communism is sometimes described as idealism gone wrong. Not so here. There is no such thing as concern for the downtrodden; pity with the poor, fighting for justice, even love for the people or the fatherland are not relevant categories in the intellectual development as depicted by JC&JH. Would another biography be able to paint a less diabolic picture of the mental structure of the man?<br />Objectivity is not really needed where the basic value judgement is so overwhelming. Still, one wonders if a little more neutrality in the early phases would not be more productive. After all, not every unpleasant youth becomes a mass murderer.<br />I have a hard time accepting the notion of the long term schemer when reading the chapters about the Long March. In my interpretation the man got lucky because he was more ruthless and \\"luckier\\" then the competition. Claiming that he planned things the way they turned out looks like prophecy with hindsight to me.<br />There is a lot of new information in the book, at least for me. Most interesting for me the parts about the relations between the Chinese opponents and the big boss in Moscow.<br />First the fight between CKS and the CCP: did the Red Army escape from Jiangxi for the Long March because CKS let them go, being under pressure from Moscow, who held his son CCK hostage? Plausible.<br />Did Moscow save CKS' life by insisting on his liberation when he was kidnapped by the Young Marshall in Xian, and when the CCP wanted CKS to be killed? Plausible.<br />Did a Soviet mole, a general in the Nationalist army,provoke the Japanese into attacking Shanghai, by violating CKS' orders to avoid provocations, in order to draw Japan deeper into China and away from Russia? Plausible.<br />Similar interesting hyptheses about later conflicts inside the CCP leadership and Moscow's attempts at meddling.<br />Very interesting the look at the possibly most damaging book of the century: Edgar Snow's Red Star over China, a propaganda tool of the highest efficiency. (When one reads it nowadays, it is so totally wooden, that one wonders how it could ever be read by a wider readership.)<br />And a lot of smaller gems like the poppy cultivation in Yanan, or the bridge drama that was entirely invented.<br />Not new, but very well described the story of state terrorism during the 40s, 50s and 60s.l in the Nationalist army,provoke the Japanese into attacking Shanghai, by violating CKS' orders to avoid provocations, in order to draw Japan deeper into China and away from Russia?

His love and compassion towards his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh, played by Amy Smart, drives him to make amends and alterations to his dreadful and dark past to secure a happy life with her, but Evan is in for one shocking result after another as his alterations turn on him. <br /> <br />The movie features a supporting cast including Eric Stoltz (Pulp Fiction) as Kayleigh's perverted dad, and Melora Walters (Magnolia) as Evan's mother. <br /> <br />Despite The Butterfly Effect's dark premise and cliched script, it succeeds in becoming an engaging spectacle of butterfly proportions! <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B

0307263118|5.0|The Sea will either delight or aggravate you.  Some may experience both reactions.<br /><br />The delight will come from finding a surprising word choice or unexpected detail on almost every page, the unusual development of the plot and the rapid shifts between thought, memory, perception, desire, musing and reflection.  For some, the fresh descriptions of male sexual awakening will also be sweet.<br /><br />The aggravation will come from realizing that the story could have been told more directly.  You will also feel yourself being manipulated quite often.  The word choices could have been more direct.  The surprises on each page become almost mechanical after awhile.  Deal with the aggravation is my advice.  Otherwise, you'll miss the chance to see how often you jump to unwarranted conclusions.  Reading this novel is like holding up a mirror to see your mind's perceptions and prejudices.<br /><br />You won't realize much of the book's power until you're done.  If you are like me, you'll immediately want to read it again.<br /><br />The story takes place while Max Morden recovers emotionally from his wife's untimely death from a wasting illness.  Uncharacteristically, Morden avoids family and friends to be quite alone most of the day while staying in a run-down rooming house where he experienced many delights as a youngster.  Being there brings up many memories of the Grace family . . . surely a metaphor for inspiration in this lover of Bonnard.  You'll find yourself drawn into those long-ago memories as well as Morden's unhappy reaction to his wife's loss.  But you'll also know that there's an enigma wrapped in a mystery.  Gradually, all will become clear through the mental peregrinations of Morden.<br /><br />I don't remember stream of consciousness done in sentences in quite as interesting a way as Mr. Banville achieves.  All aspiring novelists must read this book!<br /><br />Here's an example of Mr. Banville's power to evoke irony:<br /><br />\\"There are other things I can do. . . .

This is a good compilation but where's WASTED or ROCKS OFF or ROCK BRIGADE from the first CD? That CD is not nearly as polished as their later stuff but it rocked, had a nice raw sound to it that I liked. It would have nice to include those songs here. Oh well.<br /><br />[...]
B00005JOE8|5.0|Sword fighting, bombs, beauty, fireworks, and conspiracy all laid upon the themes of our times and exported to London. V for Vendetta is a completely satisfying movie. Whole, compelling, entertaining, inspiring, and visually awe-inspiring it overcomes its flaws and delivers like few movies ever have. As the movie begins, you may wonder how this film ever saw the light of day. Its story line is lifted right from the Bush-Cheney administration's corruption, blunders and propaganda and thinly veiled with an export of the setting to Britain. Perhaps the most amazing element of this movie is the acting. Consistently well-acted by all the the actors, those you would expect like Hurt, and those you might not, like um, Natalie Portman. Natalie is beautiful, and I found myself falling in love with her character during the movie, but I never thought she was even a mediocre actress. I have found most of performances to be some of the worst ever committed to film. But she pulls off her character her. Just like the brother brought out a worthy performance from Keanu Reeves in the Matrix, they have pulled off their magic again with another less than stellar artist. The complete version of this review will be up soon on greenagogo

It's a crime most of these songs were never released because they are so good, in my opinion, even better than her massive Titanic hit song.

B000DZIGDU|4.0|\\"Jarhead\\" is based on Anthony Swofford's memoir \\"Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles\\" about his experiences as a Marine during the Untied States' first military action against Iraq, Operation Desert Storm. The book was considerably condensed and adapted for the screen by William Broyles, Jr., a former Marine himself who served in the Vietnam War. Corporal Anthony \\"Swoff\\" Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) narrates the film, beginning in boot camp, when he first questions the wisdom of joining the Marines. In training for the elite STA Platoon, where he will be a sniper, Swoff meets Corporal Alan Troy (Peter Saarsgard), who becomes his friend and mentor. Their platoon, under the command of Marine Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), is among the first to be deployed in Operation Desert Shield after Iraq invades Kuwait. And so the wait for war begins. Hot, dehydrated, and always anxious about wives and girlfriends back home, the men get stir crazy wondering if they'll ever see any action.<br /><br />\\"Jarhead\\" is an exploration of what it was like to be a Marine in a particular place and time. More than any other war movie I have seen, \\"Jarhead\\" conveys the tedium of war. Anthony Swofford's platoon saw little action, but what they did see is rendered so visually stunning that it makes a real impression. The fact that there isn't much action allows the film to concentrate on the personalities and relationships of the men of 2nd Platoon. That's not to say the film is dull; it is deftly paced to keep us interested. And the scenes of the Kuwaiti oil wells afire, raining black gold for miles and billowing toxic fumes, are worth the price of the movie alone. Jamie Foxx delivers another strong performance as a man who loves being a Marine, looks forward to a long career, and is sympathetic to the young men under his command but at the same time contrasted to them. \\"Jarhead\\" offers some insight into the Marines' lifestyle as well as the frustration of these men who were sent to wait idly to do their jobs and then thrust into a phantasmagory of desert and fire.<br /><br />The DVD (MCA 2006): Bonus features include 3 sets of deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Sam Mendes and editor Walter Murch and 2 full audio commentaries. \\"Swoff's Fantasies\\" are 4 short deleted scenes. \\"News Interviews in Full\\" (16 ½ min) are much longer versions of the press interviews that the Marines give in the movie. And there are 11 miscellaneous \\"Deleted Scenes\\". I didn't find much of interest in the deleted scenes, but the audio commentaries are good. The first audio commentary by director Sam Mendes is a detailed scene-by-scene \\"who, what, and why\\" of what was included in the film, what was left out, and how the film is structured. This is more about filmmaking than about themes. The second audio commentary is by author Anthony Swofford and screenwriter William Broyles, Jr.  They talk about their mutual experiences in the military as it relates to the film, the film's characters, its structure, and condensing the book for the screen.

B00003CWNR|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this movie. It's not horrible, the themes and subject matter of the movie is highly controversial and might make some viewers uncomfortable depending upon their personal opinions on abortion. Somehow, though, this movie sensitively and affectively conveys the subject matter in a way that's watchable. Even though the acting was mediocre, I really liked Tobey Mcguire as the main character (i think he's such a cutie...). However, i felt that this movie was just way too long. It tends to drag along and barely picks up until it comes to the most emotional scenes, which I have to admit were a bit abject and hard to watch. But overall, the film is packed with emotion and is worth renting at least once.
B00004TWZF|5.0|Doubtless you will have seen many of the films I discuss on the big screen, and now you can see them on video/dvd too. The films' content, and setting, provide you with the vicarious enjoyment of viewing your favourite activity performed by a Hollywood star. The film may even, you hope, include a little sex, but in fact, you will surely be disappointed. Apart from, and excluding, a lurid and perverse burgery scene (Deliverance, Boorman 1972), these films will provide no compensation for any subjective deficiencies we may possess in our own lives. But mercifully the love\\" interest is present, albeit in the form of the long-suffering female companions of selfish outdoor types. Only in River Wild (Hanson, 1994) are the roles reversed. Agression is a much stronger trait possessed by these celluloid heroes, often submerged into the single-minded pursuit of a goal or criminals (Drop Zone, Badham, 1994) or the callous planning of an assassination (Eiger Sanction, Eastwood, 1975). <br /> <br />So is there archetypal outdoor hero in these films? Outdoor types, are, apparently, and according to Hollywood scripts, sophisticated, cool, intelligent, and athletic - that will do for now. In the Eiger Sanction, Clint Eastwood, who is unusually garrulous as Dr Jonathan Hemlock, has all these traits. Whereas in City Slickers (Underwood, 1991) our group of heroes start out as a bunch of misfits, the role model of a Dr Hemlock beckons, but remains only something that the characters aspire to. In the film Billy Crystal feels trapped and lost - not really surprising since he sells air\\". Ed likes scuba diving, and once suggested target parachuting. At one moment Mitch optimistically suggests, this is the best I'm ever going to  look, the best I'm ever going to feel, the best I'm ever going to do... and it ain't that great\\". How many of us have felt like that? Cattle driving, sleeping under the stars and the lure of the great outdoors is there to provide the catharsis we all need. Evenpoor old Paul has been got by the balls as his wife's got one and the father-in law the other\\" - ouch! There are stunning views of the south-western United States. <br /> <br />Dialogue may not be the film's strong point. But macho-speak is an unfortunate feature in the creation of some roles; where characterisation is so thin, strength has otherwise to be signposted with a heavy touch. Sylvester Stallone, in Cliffhanger (Harlin, 1993), has his mouth so full of macho-speak that this virtually becomes a speech impediment. If he's not talking in his unique manner, then the rest of the cast are burdened with the same macho style as these little exchanges demonstrate: [pilot (female) in a helicopter above Stallone hanging off a rock face] I don't  recognise  the face, but the butt looks vaguely familiar\\". Or Stallone's erstwhile climbing companion [to helicopter crew helping to get a couple of climbers off a windswept promontory]: Please be advised Ranger Walker [Stallone] is making advances towards my girlfriend [well, not for long...]; that's liable to get his arse kicked right off this mountain, over...\\" Wow - just how tough can you get? Fortunately, the dialogue improves enough for one to enjoy a slick production with some wonderful views of the Dolomites interspersed with some exciting terpsichorean action from Stallone. <br /> <br />But making an outdoor\\" movie requires one ingredient, which is universal to all these films - landscape. If the film doesn't open with it (as in the Eiger Sanction) it swiftly moves on to identify itself among this genre in film-making by establishing the main action in the most breathtaking location. But most start out as they intend to go on, and Cliffhanger; The Big Bue (Besson, 1988), and River Wild (albeit set in a cityscape at the start - but it is still a beautiful outdoor\\" sequence) confirm their movie's credentials in awesome style. Here landscape substitutes for dialogue. Explanations become senseless when scenery explains so much.  <br /> <br />In this sense the surfing films are all about their own particular topography - waves. Endless Summer II (Brown, 1995), and to a lesser extent Blue Juice (Prechezer, 1985), do not just survive, but exist on wiping out\\", hot - dogging\\" or as the film's name implies, the sea itself. Surf movies are just that; they embody the culture and characters of the people and places which have been growing up since the `60s. Big Wednesday's (Milius, 1978) gay sub-text (with shots up shorts) stars Jan - Michael Vincent and Gary Busey. It has great music which is lucky, because being a surf movie the producer didn't have any money left for the script. Big Wednesday only confirms the sub-section under which these movies must be judged. In fact, we are all waiting for the next surfing sequence and don't much really care about anything else. The culture is further added to by the clichs ever-present in surf culture-the VW cars, the vernacular, the bodies and, of course, the waves. It is difficult to understand what the morals or aspirations are of anyone in these movies. It must also be said that if the wave height is anything to judge a film by, then Endless Summer II wins hands down.  <br /> <br />To the extent that these films may reflect the real world, then Deliverance is both a paradigm of how to make a film and a warning of what we might all become in a lawless world-the natural world - to kill or be killed\\". Of course, serious messages in films are sometimes overtaken by the horror and fright they convey. But film-making is also about mental, as well as physical, stimulation, and Deliverance pulls no punches on either count. It is its plausibility which makes for such a tense experience. The film reflects the real world, in an unusual setting. It takes people away from a setting they know, the city, and places them in an environment they don't, or at least don't think they do. To this extent the film should be less frightening to an outdoors persons, but is it? James Dicky's novel about some suburban guys going canoeing to find themselves, is an allegory for the darker forces inside all of us. In that sense the film's tension is created from within ourselves. It all just goes to show what can happen when you decide not to play golf at the weekend. The setting, once again, is beautiful: great campfire scenes, with table food provided by nature herself - there's something in the water and the woods that we lost in the city\\". But ultimately it is not nature, but man which defeats them. <br /> <br />Cinema going is about satisfying some fantasy one may have about oneself, or the world. This an essential ingredient in life, linking our subconscious with reality. Our fantasies are fed by the celluloid stars dispensed from the screen. American Flyers (Badham, 1985) is about a race against time. For some of us that period may be longer than others. Once again opening sequences do much to define the film as the star rides his bicycle into the lift of his apartment building and finally into, and around his apartment. Enjoyable, but this may be more of a film about eighties than cycling. The problem is producers may hang a story line onto outdoor theme, but take away the clothes pegs and the story blows away. Nonetheless, American Flyers is a self-confident expression of a personal achievement and aside from some macho-style dialogue and lapses into appalling sentimentality, there are some scenes to savor - a bicycle race with a couple of cowboys on horses, the stunning landscape of Colorado and a cameo role by Eddy Mercyx (blink and you'll miss it). It is built on that common theme of outdoor films-overcoming adversity. <br /> <br />All this brings us to The Big Blue. The start of the film, shot in black and white, woderfully evokes childhood - the relationships between the children, the one-upmanship and the innocence and the glories of youth; all helped by the beauty of a quiet fishing village in Greece. The stars(Jean-Marc Bar and Jean Reno) are superb in their roles, and the development of the story into a duel about who can dive deeper, makes them appear as the most natural protagonists out of all of the films reviewed. The film captures the beauty of the deep and the association with the dolphins gives it an extra surreal dimension. It is truly a masterpiece of cinema. <br /> <br />Thus, outdoor films are a diverse product, with different emphases emanating from the different sports and story lines woven around their stars. But they are all stories based upon the need for the heroes to prove themselves (in the context of their sport) and to overcome hurdles of their own. They all provide good day-dreaming material and plenty of attractive male role models with whom one can relate, but women fare badly. In so far as the genre exists, one can lay down the parameters for their definition: athletic heroes, simple plots, and sporting stories, but where the landscape is always  the star. This can't be said of the Deer Hunter, The Godfather or The Outlaw Josey Wales. In City Slickers, Ed says, out there are all the answers\\", and Mitch finds his smile. That is what it's all about.

What an accumulation of talent saved for future generations. Like they said \\"this will never happen again\\". If you are over sixty you must buy it.
0739313126|5.0|The audio version of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was well done and it reinenforced what I had read in the hardback version.  I've listen to it several times for \\"understanding\\" and each time come away with something new.  I would recommend that Dan Brown's \\"Angels & Demons\\" be read prior to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" to serve as a prelude.  Excellent addition to your vehicle's CD Collection.

B0009UC7QQ|5.0|Jim Carrey's turnabout dramatic performance highlights this engrossing and beautifully told tale.  Peter Weir directs assuredly this story of a young man whose entire life has been a t.v. show, adored by millions around the world.  He has a perfec loving wife (the marvelous Laura Linney), and the best friend he could ever hope for (Noah Emmerich).  The series' creator is played wonderfully by Ed Harris, who won an Oscar nomination, and deservedly so.  He's like a father in his mind to Carrey, and he'll do anything to keep Carrey in his makebelieve world.  Look for Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti in a small role; he's good in this one, too.  The movie is poignant, bittersweet and by the time it's over, you'll be cheering for Truman Burbank too.  A landmark movie.

B00005JOE8|5.0|A Government's responsiblity is to it's people.   <br />A government should be afraid of it's people, not a people should be afraid of it's government.  <br />V comes to us to remind one and all that dispite the fact that we may be relatively safe in our new world full of presidential condoned illegal wiretaps, and nameless uncharged prisoners on foriegn soil we still have the power to take back our country and re-establish liberty and justice. FOR ALL!! <br />In the movie I was mainly reminded of the ideals of our own revolution. One could certainly look into it (certainly someone like that propagandist crook O'Reily) and see the Bush administration hiding behind that huge Hitlerist big brother of the film, but what I was mainly reminded of was 1776. <br />One other thing that seemed to stand out to me was the mentioning of the U.S. that apparently, at least in the propaganda enriched closed borders of this England, while faced with some of the same hardships as Mother England the U.S. stayed true to her Ideals of equality and freedom, no matter what the cost. I would rather die than live with a harness across my back. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|The BBC version was over 6 hours and this has been squashed into nearly 2 hours.  It is for this reason that many things in the book are missed out and rushed through. The Bennets were not so poor that they will lived in a house that was substandard or had pigs and other animals living near them. Lizzie walking in the field at 4.00 am in the morning would not be the done thing. We lose a lot of the smaller characters and we do not get the time to get to know most of the characters.  Everything is rushed and the first ball was like one for the underclass and not people of this class. Jane's character is lessened in this version and Catherine De Burgh would not be travelling to see Lizie late at night either.  Some serious flaws in this version and too rushed. Keira Knightly is great but Mr Darcy lacks the conviction of the BBC version. It was a stab to make this story modern but much was lost in this version that made the BBC version a classic. I liked this version but came out feeling let down and  I would not buy it. The BBC version gets the 5/5
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I was horrified.  Sat in the cinema surrounded by people who were looking for the 'Exorcist' is disguise.<br /><br />To see 'Emily', a good home grown and quiet girl possessed and defiled was horrendous. She fought the demons but after a while she could not stop them entering her, she was worn out. It was tragedy, an obscenity, the girl was religious and wholesome - that's what made her the target.<br /><br />At first it started with visions of darkness, flashes of demons in attendance all the time until finally she was mad with weariness and fright.  Her guard down, her soul engulfed.<br /><br />I remembered reading somewhere that it was based on a true story and remembered thinking that it was probably a gimmick, I so wish that wasn't true. I could have welcomed a gimmick.<br /><br />The holy mother Mary visited 'Emily' in a dream and told her she would take her to heaven rather than leave her to suffer, her body malnourished because all the demons would let her eat was splinters and lice, she was dying.  But 'Emily' declined, she wrote a note about the dream in a moment of vividness that showed how selfless her act was, if she could use what was happening to her to prove demons existed , then in kind we as a race would then be forced to believe God existed since we chose really only to believe what we can see.<br /><br />She continued to endure until she died, her priest unable to save her, then stood trail for her murder, the State advising that it was his talk of demons that meant she didn't get the 'real' help she needed.<br /><br />He was released and found guilty in the most token of manners but the film exists to make people aware of what happened.<br /><br />She died to show us that demons exist.<br /><br />Powerful stuff.  A tragic loss of life.<br /><br />All said it was an excellant movie - just don't forget why it was made.

B000E33VWW|5.0|Wow is all that I can say.  Philip Seymour Hoffman was just amazing and very deserving of his Oscar win for best actor in Capote.  His portrayal of Truman Capote during his writing of the non-fiction novel of \\"In Cold Blood\\" was just amazing.  This movie is not a typical Hollywood film, no CGI, no special effects, etc., some blood splattering, which was minimal, to illustrate the crime of which Capote's novel was based upon, no chases, no nothing, except a brilliant performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Catherine Keener.  What is amazing is the range to these two actors, they both can do comedy, both can do action and both can do a serious dialog driven film-What range and what perfect people to play these two famous people as Keener played the understudy, friend of Capote who had her own career with \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird.\\"  I have seen all best pictures nominated except for Brokeback Mountain, therefore, I can not give an opinion of my choice for best picture.  However, when doing a prior review, I thought Munich was much better than Crash (which won), which would mean that it was better than all other best movie nominees that I have seen.  However, after seeing Capote, the screenplay, the adaptation, the actors, the subject matter, the editing as well as the filming of the movie would make me think that this is the movie to see-However, again, I haven't seen Brokeback Mountain, so I will reserve my choice until later.  The director, little known, first feature film will of course not get a nod because there were higher profile directors with Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain) and Steven Spielberg (Munich), etc.,.  However, for those who want to see a wonderful, eccentric performance, one that mimics the life and times of one of America's best authors, you have to see this.  Philip Seymour Hoffman had it down-He nailed it.  He nailed Capote feminism, quirkiness, manipulation, glib, self absorbing, his need to be the center of attention among his metamorphous to being a caring, loving person of life, not necessarily of the two murderers that his novel is based upon, but his love of life for all.  Capote (or Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a master storyteller with his mentioning of one of the deaths that the pillow was placed under the victim perfectly and the victim was shot with a shotgun, like being put to sleep.  There is a lot of information available on Capote, but to narrow it down to the period after \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" to the period of the film, I believe three or four years of his life during his research for \\"In Cold Blood\\" was amazingly done.  The movie left you leaving did Capote use these people (the murderers) to make his novel or did he treasure life so much that he thought that these murderers should not die?  I don't know what his motive was, but I do know, as Capote and his publisher indicated that this novel was the start of a new way that authors write books.  Capote said that \\"When I think how good this novel can be, I can't breath.\\" makes me feel his motive was his book.

Frey's unique style of writing effectively captures the phyical and emotional turmoil of substance abuse through a riveting and compelling story.

B000301YY8|5.0|To think that Janes Blunt was a captain in the British Army prior to his recording of Back to Bedlam is austonding.  Blunts sensitive style reflects little of the marshal rigor of military life.  But thats all the better for us since his style is sweet yet strong with full of what I personally love about Brit-pop.  He has the strenghth of greats like Donovan Leach who arent afraid to say things \\"unmanly\\" and yet have the skill to make those same things appear sincere.  While \\"Youre Beautiful\\" is catchy with the hook that makes it an instant success it is not the whole of this album. Other tacks on this album are equally catchy and possibly better and on the whole this is a fine album the entire way through.  If you are looking for music for mainstream audiences that isnt boring or trite Blunt has created something that you wont be ashames to own.  This is way better than coldplay and surely James Blunt will have a long career in front of him. <br /> <br />Ted Murena
B00005JOE8|2.0|The most creative moments of \\"V for Vendetta\\" are during its flashy end credits, bathed in red, played over The Rolling Stones' \\"Street Fighting Man.\\"  <br /> <br /> No kidding.  <br /> <br /> The movie is a tremendous artistic letdown. Drab. Pompous. Obvious. So liberal it cannot possibly be considered a sincere allegory, but rather a preach-to-the-choir rant that Michael Moore would appreciate. At least Moore's \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" had the juice to stick it to the Bush administration - \\"V\\" merely wishes it so - and did not cloak its intentions behind an advertising campaign that features star Natalie Portman - who until now was Hollywood's staunchest defender of Israel, the closet thing we've got to a police-state democracy - in roundtables discussing the nature of terrorism.      <br /> <br /> The Wachowski Brothers chose to adapt Alan Moore's graphic novel as their encore to \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy, inserting the second unit director from those films, James McTigue, as director here. Set 20 years in the future, England has fallen into tyranny, with Hitleresque High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) helming a government that enforces curfews, shapes the news to fit its agenda and employs \\"fingermen\\" to execute its ultra-conservative rulebook. It's these men that harass Evey Hammond (Portman) in a London back alley one night with the intent of raping her when a man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask disarms them, rescues the girl and sweeps her to the rooftop so she can watch him bomb Old Bailey.  <br /> <br /> The man is V (Hugo Weaving), a survivor of government experiments hot for payback and revolution, using the mask of Fawkes - who tried to blow up British Parliament in 1605 - to cover his disfigured face. Theatrical, talky, tortured, brilliant, V is a political Phantom, and London is his Opera House. And shy, observant Evey is the girl he'll come to love. The morning after Old Bailey comes down, V hijacks the state-run TV network and announces he will, in one year, finish what Fawkes started. He invites all of England to come and see.  <br /> <br /> Evey is linked to V, and has no choice but to hide out with him, at least until she can escape. She succeeds, but eventually lands in state prison, where she is tortured to divulge V's whereabouts. If, in fact, she really is in state prison.  <br /> <br /> \\"V For Vendetta\\" is not without its clever twists. Or sincere performances - Portman is especially invested and effective, and Stephen Rea, as a police inspector charged with finding V, pads his resume of taciturn, shambled cops.  The weaknesses are McTigue's boring direction  and the Wachowski Brothers' script in its lack of continuity and tone - the background touches that make movies like \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and \\"Minority Report\\" challenging meditations on the future.   <br /> <br /> We never get a handle on the government, omnipresent in some scenes, absent in others. Considering his past, it's unlikely V would have the access to the unlimited quantities cash needed to execute his Parliament plan, which is straight out of \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" anyhow. And one can buy only so many moments when a key face looms just out of the spotlight or the second most-wanted terrorist in England can walk around easy breezy because she has a shaved head and a fake ID. <br /> <br /> The Wachowskis are also too occupied with their liberal markers and props to create an effective argument. V has leather-bound books, art and movie posters in his cave. That means he's wise. A friend of Evey's hides a Koran preserved in glass. That means he's tolerant. The government's symbol is a weird variation on the Christian cross. That means Christianity is twisted.  <br /> <br /> Then there's the Wachowski's agenda of sexual freedom - buried in the subtext of \\"The Matrix\\" series, but front and center in \\"V For Vendetta\\" (and previously \\"Bound\\"). A government can violate a thousand rights, and yet the movie chooses as its two testimonials a gayman and a lesbian robbed of their desires. Since the picture never exactly articulates the government's other targets, yet we're certain they exist, we're left with sense that \\"V For Vendetta\\" places gay rights at the top of its freedom hierarchy, and that tyranny strikes first at gays, and society through them, similar to the Nazis persecution of the Jews. <br /> <br /> A scarier, tougher movie goes right at the heart of V's thesis statement - \\"government should fear its people\\" - and examines it through a activist with whom it's not so convenient for the literati to side. Consider America's own twisted V - not the 9/11 terrorists, but Timothy McVeigh, the conservative wing nut who blew up a federal building in response to the FBI's raid on Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. Raised on a rich diet of reciprocity, militarism and hatred, McVeigh nevertheless had an intriguing point to make about the violations of our Second Amendment gun rights. He was a modern Guy Fawkes, he spoke of collateral damage and revolution, and when it came time to line up behind him, we instead put his execution on close-circuit television so the victim's families could watch him die. <br /> <br /> Just in case you forgot \\"V For Vendetta\\" was a fantasy.
B00005RDRO|5.0|oK oK SO this isnt citzen cane but with so many great stars including Peter Sellers Truman Capote and Peter Falk among others this is a fantatis film for the right audiences - those that love great dry humor and classicly written film.  The story is that the five most brilliant detectives from around the world are invited to dinner by an eccenric millionaire Lionel Tait to solve a murder that has not happended yet.  Each of the guests have some connection to their host and a reason to murder.  But theirs also a reason to solve the case - 1 million dollars (in 1976 that WAS a lot of money).  This film makes a mockey and comedy of the events that transpire as the guests attempt to solve the murder.  Sellers and Capote show off their brilliance and the jokes, though sometimes a bit stupid are funny.   This film is way beeter than clue and far funnier than the recent Pink Panther.  If you are looking for something funny that is classic and safe for the family this is a sure fire hit. <br /> <br />Enjoy this. <br /> <br />Ted Murena
B00007E8V4|5.0|When I first bought this album 3 years ago, I thought it was a separate album from Toxicity, not a bunch of pieces that were dropped from it. When I think of B-Sides, I think about songs that have bad production and sound ridiculous. This B-Side is nothing like this. It sounds way better than any other B-Side and is also better than Mezmerize/Hypnotize. Also, Daron's songwriting is amazing. (as usual) My favorite songs would have to be Mr. Jack, Innervision, Chick'n Stu, Highway Song, Roulette, and Streamline. Overall, this is an excellent B-Sides that is reccomended for any System of a Down fan or anybody who likes metal.
B00009PJN4|5.0|The first thing which one should take into account while talking about Aphrodite's Child is that it was a bizarre band. And highly unique, not possible to briefly describe. <br />This band is so interesting paradox, that I don't even care that much for the quality of their music, although for me it is good. I take their whole output and listen to it together, including crappy, mild pop, like \\"Marie Jolie\\" <br />The lineup consists keyman Vangelis. And he is also the main composer. But you can hardly recognise it is Vangelis! He is messing up, joking and experimenting with production all the time. And he tries to play pop, psychedelic rock and blends it with folk music. Also, there are attemts to do funky (\\"Funky Mary\\") or country (\\"Take your time\\"). Gosh! <br />There's also Demis Roussos here. And he's not only a vocal, but he also plays bass! Additionally, he once tries to shout like true rockman (\\"You always stand on my way\\"). Does he succed? Well, at least it sounds funny :) <br />The band is unbalanced. Vangelis rules all the melody (the great guitarist had problem with army, he joins the band very late ). They try to do some pleasant pop for charts, but they completly fail. Vangelis arragements are sweet, but a bit too eccentrict for pop. Roussos can't fit to the metrum with his screaming voice. But you can get used to it. <br />All in all, it is immature, sometimes almost unlistenable, eclectic pop with some rock/psychedelic/meditarrean influences. And if you know Roussos or Vangelis, it can really suprise you. Positively or negatively. Who cares :)

0393317552|4.0|The author's premise that domestication of animals, the availability and cultivation of high protein grains, the fact that the europeans carried highly contagious severe diseases for which they had developed immunity and/or resistance to gave them a major advantage over the rest of the world in terms of the western world's ability to dominate major areas of the world is very true in my opinion.<br /><br />However, I think he did not give enough credit to the contributions of the Romans and the Greeks before them in developing warefare to a fine art (even though they did not have steel, gunpowder, nor advanced naval vessles or navigational experience as the western invaders of the new world did) and the influence of written languages based upon the Latin Alphabet and based upon the common root language latin which supported knowledge transfeer and communications as contributing factors to the success of the western world over the new world and major areas of Asia.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I love the musical RENT. I've seen it a bunch of times, and I've loved every minute of it, happy to suspend disbelief and get swept up in the journey that is the musical. <br />The music is great, the cast are great, sure, it's a derpressing topic or bunch of topics at best, and the music is such a huge disjointed juxtaposition to the cast of characters' situations, but it works, and it is entertaining. <br /> <br />I love the movie RENT. I've watched it a bunch of times, and I love the music. I don't love the acting, I don't love the direction. The scenery is great, the sets perfect. Chris Columbus gives us such a strerile, clean-cut version of this gritty musical, and he takes away any sense of the original's 'urban sensibility'. <br /> <br />My point is this: RENT is a bit of a funny beast. Everyone has a situation that the everyday person would consider quite difficult. Everyone has AIDS (sorry for the Team America reference...), or is unemployed (but not willing to work), or is addicted to drugs. So, of course, the obvious thing to do would be to sing and dance. I know, it's obvious, it's a musical, but there's not one reference to prevention, only a fleeting reference to medication/rehabilitation, and one thinly veiled symbol of contraception. <br /> <br />I love the music. The soundtrack is fantastically produced and sounds magnificent, the film looks great, but unfortunately lacks a certain filmic smoothness needed to acheive the realness to allow us to truly suspend disbelief. <br /> <br />I love the music in RENT, and that's pretty much it. <br /> <br />5 stars for the soundtrack, 2 stars for the movie.

There are things I missed first time around and it was cool picking them up on second viewing. <br /> <br />The bonus features are cool.  I love seeing things that only made it onto the editing room floor.

0062502174|5.0|Where have I been the last nine years? How did I not read this book? This is just one more tally mark in the 'pro' side of joining a book club, no matter how 'soccer mom' that may be. Were it not for a book club, I would never have even known about this book. And though I was familiar with Paulo Coelho as an author, I had never read anything by him. (How utterly \\"American\\" of me!) I certainly will now. Quietly beautiful, The Alchemist doesn't bash you over the head with its message. It leaves you to find it, bit by lyrical bit. Santiago isn't a superhuman, superbrain or a damaged heroine struggling to overcome the pain of her past to find purpose in life. He's a shepherd who thinks beyond his sheep, maybe even to his own delusions of grandeur, and discovers some of the greatest and simplest treasures in life. Great, great book. It prompted me to read The Little Prince (Antoine de Saint-Exupery)after more than 25 years. If you haven't read it since high school French, and you enjoyed The Alchemist, I highly recommend reading it again now. Because of the Alchemist (and a few years!) it will seem like a different book.

B0002Z0EYA|5.0|This movie was fantastic!  I have watched it at least 25 times already and I could watch it another 25 times.  Eric Bana should have received an academy award for his performance.  The fight scenes were so exciting and the special effects were enchanting.  I loved the music.  Brad was OK but Eric was the Best!
B000024D4R|5.0|Along with The Piper and Wish You Were Here, I consider Animals to be Pink Floyd's artistic peak. Of course there are other PF albums with excellent music (for this band, 'excellent' is an understatement), but Animals is where Waters' views and sarcasm excellent words and the music are in total match. Instead of The Wall, where we find lots of songs and lot of nonsense preachery, here the few songs are all magnum opus in musical development and 'poetic' and direct lyrics. Never before (with the exception of Time and Money from DSOTM) Pink Floyd lyrics were so direct and down to earth, making the band not another far out / dreamy experience, but 'thinking man's music' (for PF, another understatement).  David Gilmour's guitar playing in Dogs is one of the best performances in rock history; Check also R Waters' bass in Pigs, unusual and funky; R Wright has also his showcase in all the songs, what would be of Floyd without its keyboards and sequencers?  Try to find the bootlegs from the In The Flesh 1977 tour, they are even better!

0393327655|2.0|Sam Harris is another issue entirely, and iffin anybody cares or has the time, it is an alright book (yet, when his primary source ad nauseam is Bernard Lewis one gets subtly the mantra of a `compassionate' conservative, even as he bashes religion altogether). What is even more saddening is that he probably passes for one of THOSE `dirty liberals.' The wolf assumes many shapes does he not . . . <br /> <br />Wish people would realize there is no difference between the slavery offered by the democrats than that of the republicans (except maybe at least they will give you some food stamps as they kill, conquer, and destroy the world; but no, I do not even think they would ever again bother to do that . . .) <br /> <br />Anyway. While Harris does an alright job dogging out religion, he immediately brings to mind someone who wants to `kill em all' just because `we' have the guns, and he, Harris, is just making it into the `will be exempt from the ghetto round-up' stage. So again, anyway, under a sub-heading entitled, \\"The False Choice of Pacifism\\" (199-203), Harris calls pacifism \\"flagrantly immoral\\" and \\"ultimately nothing more than a willingness to die\\"; and most vividly makes his point by writing how a \\"sociopath, armed with nothing more than a knife, could exterminate a city full of pacifists\\" (199). <br /> <br />Mr. Harris does strike at the heart of pacifism, and indeed, when one can always appeal to humankind's brutal savage nature, any and all can mock the pacifist's dogma. And we cannot even rebut that Jesus was a pacifist because of course Mr. Harris would contend that you are a weak-willed and deluded religionist. The point. Sam Harris is an excellent apologist for the `just-war' warmakers of America. Nothing more. Is he smart? Sure, so was Bernard Lewis, so was Aristotle, and who was Aristotle but the tutor of a soon-to-be mass murderer, so much for morally `high-minded' men heh. Bottom line; Sam Harris is probably even on the AIPAC (American-Israel Public Affairs Committee) payroll. <br /> <br />After a rather dry story about noble lies and preventative false bravery Mr. Harris himself employed (saving a prostitute from a John nonetheless, in spite of the fact he had the wrong country, wrong prostitute, and most definitely the wrong John!); consider what he writes about Gandhi. \\"We would all do well to reflect on Gandhi's remedy for the Holocaust: he believed that the Jews should have committed mass suicide, because this `would have aroused the world and the people of Germany to Hitler's violence.' We might wonder what a world full of pacifists would have done once it had grown `aroused' -commit suicide as well?\\" (202). <br /> <br />My answer is that maybe everybody may have followed Gandhi's lead and quit killing people. Really! If one is to take an unwavering stance upon the principle of Jesus/Gandhi/MLK they will more than likely get killed, assassinated by a brother in faith, or enslaved; such has been the fate of pacifists to date. Yet, one must not give up the good fight, and become just another physical fighter and killer, just because `we' have always been killers and have had wars. With this line of reasoning should we not create more cancers because we have always had cancer and that is just the way it is, or give up on the impoverished because we have always had the poor, or just kill your own mother because of course one day she will die anyway? People with little or no faith are the most easily swayed, just as people with faith are often the most dangerous . . . <br /> <br />Hitler saw France, Great Britain, and the United States carving up the planet, and I have no idea what his hatred for the Jews was all about, being that he was an Anglo-Jew himself (a manifest self-hate turned hideously outward, or some such Freudian nonsense perhaps???, if he did in fact have Jewish ancestry anyway). The point, bottom line, is that by the time Hitler came around the United States was well on it's way with conquering vast amounts of the entire globe, so pleeeeeeaaaaaaaaaassssssssssssssssssssssse . . . <br /> <br />Jesus Christ too would have been killed by Hitler, just as I would have been, and probably will yet be by America's (Rome, Babylon, whatever . . .) manifest destiny gone blinking gonzo . . . <br /> <br />And to further comment upon Harris's exemplary `intellectual' endeavor he goes on to state, \\"It is, as yet, unclear what it will mean to win our war on `terrorism' [at least he put terror in parentheses] ---or whether the religious barbarism that animates our enemies can ever be finally purged from our world--- but it is too obvious what it would mean to lose it. Life under the Taliban is, to a first approximation, what millions of Muslims around the world want to impose on the rest of us.\\" (202-3). <br /> <br />Let us disregard the Red Herrings from `terrorism' to the Taliban, and to Muslim domination of the world, and take a real look at the situation. <br /> <br />Perhaps in the days of Saladin, or in the 16th century when those `haters of modernism,' the Muslims, had their last chance at truly combating the western nations, that is until the Russians effectively crushed any further hopes of a `resurgent' Islamic world power in the 19th century Mr. Harris's above argument may have held some power. Yet today, Islamic nations are fighting for their very lives before the all-powerful American and Israelite military juggernauts. People fighting on their own land, against foreign invader's (American invaders) warplanes and other assorted weapons of mass destruction, and they are the ones labeled terrorists, and the American people are stupid enough to allow their minds to thusly me molded. Well: may God's fiery retribution consume us all I say . . . <br /> <br />So, b4 I get hopelessly off track, \\"The End of Faith\\" by Sam Harris is a good book, but do not buy it. I am tired of funding these right-wing war-making zealots by even buying their sophistically veiled propaganda. <br />
B00005JO20|5.0|Jackson has given \\"King Kong\\" the epic treatment the classic story deserves.  The film is a labor of love dedicated to all those pre-teenage boys who grew up watching the original 1933 classic on the million dollar movie on Thanksgiving day and wanting to become filmmakers.  Those people who complain about the 3 hour running time just don't get \\"Kong\\" and they probably never will.  How else could Peter Jackson do it without making it big, bold and beautiful?  Sure, the exposition has a lot of stuff thrown in for good measure, like the whole \\"Heart of Darkness\\" commentary (which I would have liked to have seen developed further), but so what?  I thought it was great! <br /> <br />Nothing will surpass the originality and imagery of the original film, as well as Fay Wray and her screams, but Jackson has made a \\"Kong\\" which pays homage to the original and is a great film in its own right.
0740748475|5.0|As a newspaper addict I doubt I missed very many Calvin and Hobbes and man do I miss not getting my daily dose!!!<br /><br />I received these books as a Christmas present and what an awesome present it is, I'm still reading the first book though I admit I skimmed through the others to write this review.  Anyone who loved Calvin and Hobbes would be most grateful for the complete set in such a high quality format so it'll last a lifetime.<br /><br />What's amazing about reviewing the complete works is how little development of the strip occurred, Watterson comes out sprinting, with the first strips comparing favorably to the last strips - all providing plenty of belly laughs for those that love these guys.<br /><br />Only Gary Larsen's Far Side is equal to the quality Watterson presents.  As much as I enjoy Dilbert, it misses way more than Watterson's Calvin in both insights and entertainment value.<br /><br />While I doubt I'd spend this money on myself (preferring to buy one at a time), I sure enjoyed the gift of getting all.<br /><br />Calvin remains a personal hero. . .  Thanks Mr. Watterson for helping me to stay young at heart!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly's accurate description (sci-fi, comedy, adventure, western) hardly does it justice. This series has witty dialogue and great writing. The plot is exceptional, the characters admirable. This is the complete first (and only) season of the wonderful show Firefly. The four-disc set has every aired episode, and a few that were never aired. It also has plenty of special features. It's worth owning to watch again and again. The only problem? When I watched the last episode I knew I'd never again get to see a new one; no more will be made. So cherish the ones available for the masterpieces they are.
B000E97HIA|4.0|I'm still trying to figure out what \\"3121\\" means.  It's either numerology, or the date the album came out (3/21)? or his new address in Hollywood?  Who knows what Prince is thinking....As far as the new album, you never know how much you really like it until you hear it a couple hundred times.  I think \\"Musicology\\" was a bit more intricate and substance oriented.  \\"3121\\" seems more of a dancy affair and more about love and romance.  It's like \\"Prince meets N'sync\\", but not in an insulting way.  In my oppinion Prince always puts out pure quality music, and it's hard not to compare his previous works.  Here is a track by track review for \\"3121\\"............    1. 3121- 5/5  Synth jam futuristic funk with a fonky twist.    2. Lolita- 5/5  Another Prince song about a girl.  Definately not \\"Bambi\\".  This song has a great dance hook and has a good breakdown at the end.  (Sounds like The Time helped him out with the male back up vocals).    3.  Te Amo Corazon- 4/5  Prince gets bilingual with a romantic ballad.  It has a good background beat and old skool Prince instrumentation.  Sort of has the same flow as \\"I Need To Know\\" by Marc Anthony, but slower paced.    4. Black Sweat- 5/5  One of my faves.  Prince has a new dance and it's called tha work it!!!!!!    5. Incense and Candles- 3/5  This song might have to grow on me.  It's a sort of sing-a-long song that you could memorize after 2 listens.  Could get annoying after a while and that's what I'm afraid of.    6. Love- 4/5  Originally this was my favourite track but after a couple listens it's fading a bit.  A simple title and a simple song about Love.  If Wendy and Lisa contributed to this song, it may have had a bigger impact but it's still a good Prince jam.    7. Satisfied- 3/5  Not m' fave! and I'm NOT satisfied.  It makes \\"Insatiable\\" sound like a grammy winner for Song of the Year.  This song makes you miss the days of \\"Do Me Baby\\"., \\"International Lover\\", \\"Adore\\", \\"Insatiable\\", etc..........    8. Fury- 4/5  This song is lyrical, dancable, and has a good beat and it's easy to dance to.  Another song Wendy and Lisa should have played on.  Good groove.    9. The Word- 4/5  I thought this song was going to be a ballad judging by the title.  A rainy day jam with a message.    10. Beautiful Loved and Blessed- 4/5  At first I disliked this song but it tended to grow on me.  It's sing-a-long and bouncy.  It features Prince's new muse, Tamar!    11. The Dance- 5/5  M' other fave on the album.  I thought it sounded familiar from the song of the NPG album download.  Cool deep track.    12. Get On the Boat- 3/5  Prince rocks the boat with this all over the place jam, but I'm not exactly feelin' it.  Sea sick!    \\"3121\\" wines and dines you.  Prince is in the house, literally as we take a tour of his new sound and gaze at the brochure (oops I mean liner notes!!)  Prince finally got his \\"big, white mansion\\" Go 'head Prince.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Until today, I had only heard one song by Michael Buble, but with a gift card to use up, I grabbed this off the shelf and hauled it home. No, he's not quite in Sinatra's league yet, or even Tony Bennett's, but Frank and Tony were not as good in their first few years of performing as they later became, either. This is an impressive disc, with 12 winners and only one dud...his version of the Beatle's \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\" No one really should mess with that. He does a great job with \\"The More I See You\\" which has been one of my all-time favorite lyrics for the 50 years I've been a fan of love songs. His version of \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\" is also quite successful. Perhaps no one will ever do it as well as The Drifters, but Michael's performance is better than the one released by Emmy Lou Harris several years ago, and I like Emmy Lou. I never liked \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\" when it was fresh, but this is the best version I've heard. There are several lesser-known songs presented on the disc as well, and a couple of originals, and all are good. If you like American pop songs of the 20th century, and male vocalists, give Michael a chance. I'll bet you'll be pleased.
B00001U03Q|1.0|Holy Hell, before this crap came out, I didn't think you could screwup a Eric Clapton album. My Fatass was wrong. All you've got to do is make a greatest hits album with none of his good hits. Where is \\"After Midnight\\", Wonderful Tonight\\", \\"Cocaine\\", and \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\". Somebody please tell me, cause they aren't on here. \\"I Shot the Sherrif\\" was a #1 hit in 1974. You wouldn't know from this steaming pile of HORSES***. And this cd contains his version of \\"Layla\\". If they can put that on here, then they can put songs from The YardBirds, Delanie and Bonnie and Friends,Blind Faith, and Cream. At least put \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\". His solo on that was amazing. Hell, if they wanted to, they could put The Beatles hit, \\"While My Guitar Genly Weeps\\". Clapton provided the solo for that song and a great solo it was. Once again, you wouldn't know it from this album. Clapton's brilliance on a guitar can be matched only by Page, Gilmour, and Hendrix. His soloing was emotional, touching, and like no other before or after, but this album sucks!
B00000J7S8|5.0|I'd heard a few Krall tracks on the radio, and saw her a time or two on TV, but this is the first Diana CD I've purchased. I did not even realize that this release was seven years old. I was spending a gift card at a big discount store, and this one was the only Krall CD on the shelf. I knew eight of the 13 songs, so I took it home. And played it. And played it again. And again. What a nice way to do laundry on a Saturday afternoon, with the lovely Diana for company. Her voice is great, the arrangements are interesting, and her \\"Diana Krall Trio/Quartet\\" of 1999 sounds fantastic. If you like romantic jazz vocals of leisurely tempo, you can't go wrong with this item.
B0009J8GWQ|4.0|This is one of Bruce's better albums and the tracks still sound as good as they've always done but now we get them in a cool lp sleeve format. This version has all the lyrics printed on a mini flyer insert albeit you'll need a good magnifying glass to read them but it's still a nice touch. No need to despair though as both the Japanese and English lyrics are also reproduced on an insert.<br /><br />Why just 4 stars then? Well, the recording isn't remastered and so the sound is about the same quality as the cheaper U.S. press that you can get you hands on elsewhere.<br /><br />As far as unremastered discs go, this is probably quite decent if you don't mind the muddy sound but seeing as how practically everybody and their grannies have had their classic albums remastered and cleaned up, I wonder what's keeping Bruce's people from doing the same.<br /><br />So unless you are a very big fan of lp sleeves like I am, you may not want to spend the extra bucks on this.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the album is still great with regards the tracks but I guess if you already have this, what's it going to take to make you wanna get another version of the same thing? I'm guessing it's either vastly improved sound quality and/or improved packaging. This disc only fulfils one of these two criteria so you decide what you wanna do.<br /><br />By the way, it's the same with the other titles in this format like \\"Born To Run.\\" and \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" etc. just so you know. As I don't already have copies of these discs, I didn't mind too much but I don't know about you.
B00005JKN9|5.0|This is easily in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. Of course, being a good Irish-Catholic boy, I am certainly biased. For all the corruption and criminality portrayed in this movie, it is impossible to exaggerate the influence and impact of Irish-Americans on this nation, especially New York and the northeast. We were the first major non-WASP migration(besides the enslaved Africans) to America, and our impact can still be felt to this day. This film shows the uglier side of those immigrants and those who opposed their arrival, but also highlights the dynamic spirit and faith of those all too human men and women known as the Irish.<br /><br />With all that said, I found the movie highly entertaining and extremely well done. The cinematography is awesome and the details such as, wardrobe, street lingo, and gang names are all in place. I also have to agree with previous reviewers about Daniel-Day Lewis' portrayal of \\"The Butcher.\\" Definitely one of the best performances in recent film. Also, contrary to many reviewers, I think DiCaprio holds his own in this film. Some have criticized the alleged lack of historical accuracy, but I have a news flash, IT'S A MOVIE!! Much of the background of the movie is fact, but of course it is embellished to make it a more enjoyable film. I expected that. I believe this is an excellent film that shows a somewhat forgotten part of American history. Well done.

0930289528|5.0|Having just seen (yesterday)the film and read the original graphic novel in 1987. I would give a thumbs up to the film, although the Wachowski Brothers have stay mostly faithful to the book with a few  exceptions ie Evey's occupation, Finch's relationship to V and the ending. I can see Moore's objections to the changes, however these changes in no way lessens the tone & feel of the book. Go read the graphic novel & watch the film. It really does not matter which order you do first. Enjoy the book & film - I did.
B0006399FS|1.0|It's because the music industries have hit the all-time low since no one can make good music anymore. They have no one to choose, so they ended up choosing U2 as a winner. If that album was produced in 1982, it would have been banned by the music industry and would immediately get thrown out. <br /> <br />This U2 album is the worst I've ever heard in my life.
B00005JOUM|4.0|For about an hour and 45 minutes, Inside Man had me on the edge of my seat, totally clueless as to what was going on and how the film was going to be resolved.  But then, when the ending finally happened, I found myself to be pretty disappointed.  Not disappointed in the film overall, but just at how Spike Lee decided to wrap it up.<br /><br />The plot is really simple:  Dalton Russell, played brilliantly (as always) by Clive Owen, has devised \\"the perfect bank robbery,\\" which he is executing in a branch of the bank in the middle of New York City.  Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) is called on the scene as the head negotiator, and proceeds to delve into a cat-and-mouse game with Dalton.  The situation is further complicated when Jodie Foster, who plays an unexplained, extremely influential woman, comes onto the scene demanding to be given access to the robbers and to the bank itself.  Foster's character is the one part of the movie that just doesn't seem to fit.  We know why she is there, but her character is not developed at all.  We don't know why she does what she does, how she got to this point, or why she is so ridiculously confident about getting her way.<br /><br />Other than Foster's character, we pretty much know exactly the kind of person we are dealing with when it comes to Russell, Frazier, and the other important roles.  While the film does a great job of infusing the racial issue with the routine bank heist storyline, the film ultimately trips over its own feet.  A film with this much build up, and when the build up is this well done, needs to absolutely blow the viewer away with the ending, or the whole film seems to be for naught.  When the ending comes, I was left thinking, \\"is this really why the robbers went to all this trouble?\\"  There are some minor plot holes, but the film does explain itself, just not to the extent that I was expecting or hoping for.  This is the best Spike Lee film that I have ever seen, but that really isn't saying that much...<br /><br />Inside Man definitely gets my recommendation, but be forewarned that the film ultimately can't live up to its own cleverness.that much...   <br /> <br />Inside Man definitely gets my recommendation, but be forewarned that the film ultimately can't live up to its own cleverness.

B000DWMN2S|4.0|Several months ago, I tried to read the Jonathan Saffron Foer novel this movie was based on. Unlike his later novel, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, I didn't really like it. The writing style was really hard to follow, and while I could tell there was a great story there, I just could not stick it out. When I heard it was being made into a movie, I knew it would be good, and this film has not disappointed. I think it helped to have the narrative told in a more linear fashion. The story is still pretty complex, but it didn't completely lose me as the novel had. The actors were really something too, particular the one playing Alex, the \\"translator\\" who has learned a great deal of his English words from Roget's Thesaurus: Think Da Ali G in the Ukraine. Very funny. The extra scenes on the DVD are also worth watching. This movie refuses to fit any pre-conceived molds and successfully made me both laugh and get a bit teary-eyed. Wonderful stuff! Definitely worth watching!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|If you thought The Mars Volta's first album was crazy, you haven't put this in your CD player yet!  'Frances The Mute' definitely leans towards the progressive side of progressive rock.  This album takes the attributes of the first album, then blasts them off into outer space. The instrumentation is wilder, the songs are longer and more complex and the changes in mood are more startling.  One gets the feeling that the first album was only a warmup.   <br /> <br />There are no songs as such on this album, just sprawling soundscapes, reminiscent of the progressive rock of the 1970s. It can be a little hard on the ear at times, especially the white noise between songs, but it's well worth the patience of the listener.  'Frances The Mute' is definitely not background music, it's necessary to give it your full attention.  In that sense, it can be quite draining, but it's well worth it. <br /> <br />I can't really describe the music and the epic scale on which it has been made, except to say that progressive rock fans and fans of The Mars Volta should really like this. 'Frances' is an amazing achievement and one of the most ambitious albums I've heard.  Pick it up now! <br /> <br />Also, fans of this album should see The Mars Volta live.  I've been twice, and it was the most intense musical experience of my life.  These are some fantastic musicians!
B00097A5HW|5.0|I bought this cd as a gift for my wife because she likes spanish music.  I am more into rock music such as weezer, pavement, elliott smith, and rogue wave.  The first time I heard the cd, I thougth it had some good dance beats and liked her voice.  After repeated listens, I was hooked.  I can't understand a word she is saying, but it is more beautiful in spanish than it would be in english.  I go through so many cds, and there are very few cds that I don't get sick of after a while.  This is one album that I can listen to over and over and not get sick of.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Before the Oscar was awarded to Philip Seymour Hoffman for his leading role in \\"Capote\\", I knew very little of the author portrayed by Seymour and even less about the real life circumstances upon which the best selling account \\"In Cold Blood\\" is based.  After seeing the film I believe that my absence of any prior knowledge about the subject or the author were the best conditions under which to experience this film.  In late 1959, a Kansas family is burglarized and savagely murdered in their rural home.  Truman Capote, an established American writer of both fiction and nonfiction, notices a New York Times article about the murders and the capture of the perpetrators.  He is drawn to the story by way of the curiosity ignited when pondering the question, \\"Why did they do that?\\"<br /><br />In attempting to answer that question, Capote convinces his publisher to finance a project that would result in an in-depth article (turned international nonfiction best seller) about the crime and the murderers. Assisted by life long friend and colleague Harper Lee, Capote sashays into Holcomb, Kansas to interview residents, police and the killers.  As part of his job as a journalist, Capote is required to ask questions and extract the intimate details of not only the crime but also the motivation behind it.  In order to obtain the quality of information needed, Capote sought to connect with Perry Smith, one of the murderers, in a way that created trust through shared experiences.  Smith's life experiences as half Native American, orphaned and poor, has some commonalities with Capote's experiences as gay,  orphaned (sent to live with relatives in Alabama after parents divorced), and living a life on the margin of social norms.  \\"It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. And one day he went out the back door and I went out the front\\", comments Capote, demonstrating the commonalities, yet extreme differences between the two.<br /><br />Over the course of the next few years, Capote's relationship with Smith deepens and becomes the central conflict in the film.  As the relationship intensifies and Capote sees Smith as human, vulnerable, in need; Smith, in turn, sees Capote as vulnerable, available, and in need.  The dance of manipulation and genuine care is intricate, elaborate and well portrayed throughout the film.  The film culminates with the execution of the murderers and the completion of the book.  I thought \\"Capote\\" a well done and artistic depiction of the events surrounding the Clutter Family massacre.  The film sufficiently sparked my interest and with a little internet research I was able to verify much of the information contained in the film as factual.  Shot in black and white with period specific accruements, the film was an excellent introduction to an American literary figure whose name was the only thing that I knew about him.

B000E1YW0E|5.0|First off, I have never seen the on stage musical version of Rent like most people who have reviewed this movie so I cannot compare. No one had really told me what it was about so I rented it unknowing of what I was really going to be watching, I knew it was a musical and thats it.  <br /> <br />Ive noticed that some of the people who commented on the movie were dissing it because they said it was a movie only for gay people. I am a married twenty three year old woman and I have two kids. Im as straight as they come.  <br /> <br />I loved the opening song, Seasons of Love. When Mark and Roger started singing the song about rent though, I have to admit I wasnt diggin it too much. My mind started to stray.. Well maybe I won't like this movie.. maybe i'll turn it off.  But I continued to watch it.  <br /> <br />Then when Roger began to sing about April in Glory I saw the depth of what the movie was expressing and I got interested. Then when MiMi knocked on the boys' apartment door and began to sing Would you light my candle to Roger.. I got hooked. I sat there intrigued listening to all the lyrics of all the songs. Then you meet Angel. Angel is a cross dressrer. Angel's character is charasmatic and upbeat even though she is dying of aids.  <br /> <br />The friendship that this group of friends shares is amazing. Some of them have aids, one is a stripper, and a few of them have experimented with drugs. They are all learning how  meaningful life is and to live life as if each moment is your last.  <br /> <br />Which brings me back to the title of my review: No day but today: in translation: Live your life to the fullest. I laughed during Angel's dance scene after the mishap with Evita the Akita and cried when Collins sang I'll cover you at Angel's funeral.  <br /> <br />This movie would probably be more meaningful to some one in their twenties to early thirties. Younger ones may not be able to absorb everything hat this movie represents.  <br /> <br />This movie is great. Don't let people with negative reviews turn you off to it. Open up your mind and give it a try. Even if you watch the begginning and start to think 'this isnt for me' ..like I did.. dont turn it off. Watch the whole thing through.. Or atleast until when Angel passes away.  <br /> <br />You just might be surprised how much you like it!
B000A0GXGA|5.0|My guess is they put these samplers out to test the waters to see if there's a market for a particular show. I have this disc and although I haven't viewed this one yet, the F Troop (Television Favorites) has very nice quality for the price. Witness what they've done with F Troop & Cheyenne. The (Television Favorites) compilations were released September 27, 2005 same as this one. Now F Troop & Cheyenne Season One are both due out June 6, 2006. Apparently the sales warranted more serious releases. My advice is if you like this show buy it because it's bargain-priced and if you don't have American Life TV channel (comcast dropped it in my area) you're not going to see it anywhere else.<br />Oh, and you'll most likely be voting for a full-blown release in a language they can understand- $$$.
B0000073PU|5.0|Not much needs to be said about NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS, but the second disc is a necessary purchase even if you bought the SEX PISTOLS BOX, which is full of demos (but not all of them). There was not enough time to fit everything on that, so some tracks were cut from it. This 2CD set was issued first. The following track list was found after researching on the web. This info is not on the set (actually almost no info is on the set).     1. Seventeen *  2. Satellite *  3. No Feelings *  4. I Wanna Be Me *  5.

The song list of the CD corresponds to the song titles of the original SPUNK bootleg LP.
B000006U44|5.0|As you know, this is Kate Bush's debut, and it was released in February 1978. It is not one of her best albums, and Kate was still growing as a musician, but this album is still very very good, peaking at #3 in Australia and the UK.<br /><br />It begins with one of my favourites, \\"Moving\\" - it begins with strange effects, and is about Kate's dance teacher. I like it because it is very haunting and different, even compared with today's music. \\"The Saxophone Song\\" is the first song that was written for this album and I admit it sounds a bit dated. It is very beautiful and very 70's-y. \\"Strange Phenomena\\" is next, and to be honest, this is one of my least favourites. It is very mainstream and would have done well as a single, but I just don't find it different enough, and Kate Bush is a very unique artist. This would have made a good third single, but I guess the record company wanted Kate to quickly make a second Album.<br /><br />\\"Kite\\" is a strange song, and it reminds me of Tori Amos for some reason. There are a lot of leaps in tempo in this song, and this is why I like it so much. \\"The Man With The Child In His Eyes\\" was the second single from this album and peaked at #6. It is a very short and sweet ballad, but I think that a better single could have been chosen (maybe tracks 1, 3 or 9). The classic \\"Wuthering Heights\\" follows and it is my favourite song from this album. The song starts of with a piano, with a key change every bar or two, and it peaked #1 in Australia, #108 in the US and also #1 for four weeks in the UK. It was completely different to the pop music scene at the time, but accessible enough for everyday people to purchase the single. \\"James and the Cold Gun\\" is a good song, and I love the electric guitar after the chorus.<br /><br />\\"Feel It\\" is another ballad, and is very... sexual. I found it boring at first but I really enjoy it now. It only features vocals and a piano. \\"Oh To Be In Love\\" is very very different, and compared to other tracks on this album - it is good but not great. \\"L'Amour Looks Something Like You\\" was one of my early favourites. It is again, quite a sexual and SENSUAL song, and very beautiful and atmospheric. It is not very long though - at around 2-30. \\"Them Heavy People\\" was a song I found annoying at first and was stuck it my head for who knows how long. It has great contrast between 'Rolling the ball', the verses, and choruses, and is a very fun song. \\"Room for the Life\\" is about how it is good to be a woman, and is still a very strange song. \\"The Kick Inside\\" is a piano ballad, which closes the album beautifully, and is one of the longest songs from the album.<br /><br />9.5 / 10s on this album - it is good but not great. \\"L'Amour Looks Something Like You\\" was one of my early favourites.

B000EGF0B4|5.0|I really didn't want to go see this movie because I knew it was going to make me cringe.  And I was right, it did.  But I also liked it a lot more than I expected I would.  The scenery, music, editing and acting come together to produce a beautiful, thoughtful and tragic story that has a lot to say about the nature of human relationships and what we need and value in them.  Ang Lee definitely deserved the directing oscar, as this could have been detestable if not wholly laughable.  Instead what we have in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is nothing short of a melancholy masterpiece.
B000063DFS|5.0|This is the best Ozzy album. Ever. Superb lyrics (some of which were co-wrote with Lemmy), and brilliant, chunky riffs, replete with squeals. I Don't Wanna Change The World, Mama I'm Comin Home, Desire, Time After Time, Road to Nowhere - these are songs that clearly exert real meaning, for both Ozzy and for the listener. Listen to this album when you're going through hard times, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />I don't like Black Label Society much, nor Wylde's love of biker gangs and beards. But this is the album that answers why he is considered one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time.  <br /> <br />Personally I find the production ok - it has dated quite a bit (but hasn't everything?) - You can hardly blame them for trying to make an album that catered to listeners tastes at the time.  <br />(And to those people who say Ozzy went commercial here - what do you call 'The Osbournes'???). <br /> <br />In fact, this is not only Ozzy's best, but one of the greatest hard rock albums of all time.
B00004LN16|5.0|Stiff Upper Lip is AC/DC's 17th and most recent album to date. This album came out in 2000, and believe me it's been a long six year wait. This is also the very first AC/DC album I ever bought so it holds quite a bit of sentimental value to me, but rest assured it rocks just as hard as anything else they have put their hand to.<br /><br />Stiff Upper Lip 15/10 - This is my very favorite AC/DC song, as if you can't tell by my high rating. One listen to this song and you will be hooked forever, I was, and still am today. Fast paced and blues at the same time just an awesome song overall!<br /><br />Meltdown 10/10 - This is another great track that follows the same AC/DC formula of the past 30 years, rock hard and make no apologies.<br /><br />House Of Jazz 10/10 - A great rock / blues song, the only complaint with this is the lyrics are kind of weak, and that is very hard for me to say since most of Angus's and Mal's lyrics kick. Good song none the less give it a listen.<br /><br />Hold Me Back 8/10 - A good song overall, but it lacks something. Still AC/DC''s worst equal most other bands best.<br /><br />Safe In New York City 10/10 - Well this is the second gem on the album, nothing here but straight ahead un-apologetic rock n roll. Awesome song one listen and you'll agree.<br /><br />Can't Stand Still 10/10 - The only reason I don't call this a gem is that when I first heard it I thought it was rank. After several listens this is one of my absolute favoreite AC/DC songs ever. Good foot stompin' beat with good lyrics.<br /><br />Can't Stop Rock 'N' Roll 8/10 - Good song, just does'nt seem like there was alot of energy put into it. Give a listen you might disagree.<br /><br />Satellite Blues 10/10 - Pretty common AC/DC song here, wich is why it kicks butt. Great rock n roll song, and the video is pretty cool also.<br /><br />Dammed 8/10 - This song is ok, not a favorite of mine.<br /><br />Come And Get It 8/10 - Another non fav of mine, but like I said before their bad still means good.<br /><br />All Screwed 8/10 - Good song overall, but you will have to be the judge as to weather you dig this tune or not.<br /><br />Give It Up 10/10 - Great way to end the album, awesome rock n roll song and one of the best on the album.<br /><br />After all these years, AC/DC still kicks alot of butt. It has been six years since we have had an album and we are all about starving here guys!! We the fans love you, but were ready for the next time. AC/DC FOREVER!!!!said before their bad still means good. <br /> <br />All Screwed 8/10 - Good song overall, but you will have to be the judge as to weather you dig this tune or not. <br /> <br />Give It Up 10/10 - Great way to end the album, awesome rock n roll song and one of the best on the album. <br /> <br />After all these years, AC/DC still kicks alot of butt.

B000089RVX|5.0|This is Evanescence's first album.  They have a slightly unusual style, and this album is a little different than most mainstream music---it has elements of heavy metal, goth, choir, and pop music.  Still, it doesn't really take any of these to the extreme and in my opinion sounds very good.  Also, the lyrics, which are sung beautifully by Amy Lee, are clean and for the most part deep and intelligent.    The album features the well-known singles \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" \\"Going Under,\\" \\"My Immortal,\\" and \\"Everybody's Fool.\\"  But this is one of those albums in which all the material is good, and I think it will appeal to many listeners.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|As many people here have said, Jane Austen's wonderful book is one of my favorites. I haven't seen the Colin Firth mini-series, but I have seen and loved the great BBC version. One problem here is that people are comparing the two five hour (approximately) mini-series with the two hour movie. Necessarily things are going to be left out of the movie. Naturally the character development has to be shortened. No one is going to sit in a movie theater for five hours. I think the story came across intact considering the time alotted.    The way I see it P&P 2005 is a modern version complete with modern cinematography, modern actors and a beautiful, lush soundtrack. I thought the actors did a fine job, especially the very expressive Darcy. I agree that the Bingley character was a little goofy, but I thought that made him endearing. Elizabeth was smart and independent and I enjoyed the rowdiness of her family. I realize that these same traits bothered other people, but they give this version it's own style. Those who want to know more about Austen's satirical look at society can pick up the book.    I think the most important review on these pages was the one from a woman with no prior interest in Austen, who happened to catch the movie on a plane flight. She was delighted and went home and bought the book, read it and saw both of the mini-series. A fan is born and that, to me, is the important thing here. If this movie brings more people into the Jane Austen fold, more power to it. On the other hand, if people see it and that's the only exposure to Jane Austen they get, I'm sure they will get along just fine.    I must add that I resent people saying it was dumbed down for American tastes. Isn't it possible to write a review without insulting a whole nation?
B000000OQF|5.0|This is the original Guns N' Roses album.  It is a legendary, pure rock album, and is generally considered not only their best, but also one of the greatest albums of all time.    I have to say I do think it is slightly overrated, due partly to the odd vocals and some of the 1980ish lyrics.  Still, in my opinion, most of the songs rate from good to classic.  The three most famous tracks---\\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" \\"Paradise City,\\" and \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\"---are still on rock stations somewhat often even today, nearly two decades after their release.    If you are a fan of Guns N' Roses or a fan of angry rock music, and you haven't heard this album before, I recommend it.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Constantine is a man, gifted with supernatural skills; he is able to look inside far beyond the quotidian `s reality , allowing him to establish a direct link with secret forces, which has to deal with the same hell  .<br /><br />Through a meticulous and descriptive script, we will notice his dramatis personae. His lifetime; that vital clepsydra will make he makes a last redemption act. A puzzled thriller that combines and recreates some previous films such \\"The exorcist\\" or \\"The demons\\" , counts with a brilliant team of special effects, enigmatic photography and ravishing edition; Rachel Weisz in her double role is marvelous and Keanu Reeves reminding us his role as<br /><br />\\"Neo\\" in Matrix makes an effective performance.<br /><br />After you watch this film you would have to reconsider the well known Aldous Huxley `s essay  \\"The doors of perception.\\"

0446677450|1.0|I'm gonna save you the cost of buying this book and the time you'd spend reading it by summing it up for you in a brief paragraph. Ready? <br /> <br />This is a capitalist society. There are capitalists and workers. Be a capitalist. Workers are a bunch of dumb, whiny losers.  <br /> <br />That's it. It just takes him several hundred pages to spell it out in painful detail.

0066620996|5.0|This is an excellent book to give to young people, which I did, because it gives them a mechanism for looking at unanticipated change in their career lives. Very often, we need a roadmap to assist us in navigating the troubling waters of corporate and company life itself...something to stand separate and unique from our colleagues. We often don't see the need for rain before the sun in order to see the flowers of spring. I highly recommend this book as a college graduation gift for the young person entering the work world -- an appropriately placed message on the \\"fly\\" will give them the courage they need to go forward.     I also recommend [...] for a great practical primer on whats occuring in the world economy and to gain knowledge on how to secure a place in the newest careers.
B000002GJS|5.0|This album is one of the all time classics, and when you listen to it you will see why, almost every song is awsome. Mutt Langue, hot off producing Def Leppard's Hysteria, took the Def Leppard sound he helped create and mixed it with Bryan Adams to create a studio album that Adams has not come anywhere near too since quality wise, pitty really.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|To miss out on seeing \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is to miss out on the most brilliantly-made miracle of a movie ever made.  It is a story that every person on earth can relate to - and will feel a kinship with. <br /> <br />The story is so real, you will relate to it immediately, no matter who you are.  We have all known these characters, and as a result, we know that what we are seeing is real.  What we are seeing is actually every day life - things in OUR OWN world - which is why the tragedy of the story has such a tremendous impact upon everyone who sees it.   The fact that Jack & Ennis are cowboys is inconsequential; this story takes place with different characters across the globe, in Wyoming, in Kenya, in Nepal, in Poland, in Uruguay... <br /> <br />I recommend that you see this film at LEAST twice.  Even if you do not blink throughout the movie, you will miss things if you only see it once.  Ang Lee has packed so many details into every frame that it is impossible to pick up on everyone in one viewing. <br /> <br />Books and doctoral dissertations will be written about this film.  There is THAT MUCH brilliance put into it.  The comparisons to Homer's Aeneid and to Plato's Banquet, the yin and yang of Ennis driving across the mountainous expanse in one direction at the beginning of the film and then riding in the other direction at the end, the meaning of the color blue in the film, the astonishing camera-work in the final scene between Jack and Ennis, the stunning scene in which Ennis discovers the shirts in Jack's bedroom, and so much more will be written about and studied for decades to come. <br /> <br />\\"Brokeback\\" is a must-see also for at least 7 of the most brilliant acting performances ever put on film.  Heath Ledger's career and life will be transformed forever by the unforgettable brilliance of his portrayal of Ennis.  Even author Annie Proulx has indicated that Ledger understoof Ennis better than she did, and she created the character!  Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams also moved into the Big Leagues of Acting with their brilliant performances, which will delight and haunt you. Anne Hathaway is superb as the beautiful gal who becomes more blonde and stilted with every year of her loveless marriage.  The actors who play Jack's parents will leave you stunned with the perfection of their brief yet terrifying look into the world of the Twist family, and Linda Cardellini is extraordinary in her role. <br /> <br />The film is very true to the story.  I highly recommend that you read the story before seeing the film.  It will greatly enhance your understanding of what takes place.   <br /> <br />Everyone who sees \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is haunted by it for days.  Prepare for an unforgettable experience.  You will be a better person for it.
6304119046|2.0|Most reviewers who maintain that it was one of the greatest movie only talk about the camera angles, effects etc.  What about the story?  What about the entertainment?  What about the thing about a good movie that makes you want to see it again?  I am sorry but I don't think this movie was up to the mark from that perspective.  Nobody, in all these reviews, could really explain the story clearly!  Even if you agree that there was some deep meaning in this movie...well, you have to agree that the meaning was so deep that it got lost to most of the audience!  does that make a movie great?<br /><br />I am sure that if one shows this movie to people who don't have any prior information about it, and thus no pre-conceived notions of it being a 'great' movie, then most of those people will find it a very passable and even boring movie.  And in my opinion, that does not qualify a movie as a great movie.  It might be technically a brilliant film for its time, but technicalities alone don't make a movie great...or even good.
B000E97HIA|4.0|The reviewers all say that this is the old Prince, and that this is a better effort than the eagerly awaited \\"Musicology\\".  So when anyone talks about this that enjoys it, that's the first thing they say.  That all depends on the Prince that you remember.<br /><br />The first Prince album I ever heard, and subsequently owned, was \\"Controversy\\".  That one came out in 1981, when I was a whole 12 years old (my mom wasn't uptight about small stuff, and musical taste?  Small stuff).  When I heard that it was \\"old Prince\\" music, I thought it was going to be something like that.  Hmm.. not to me.  From that album, I went both backwards and forwards, building my collection.  I don't think, before purchasing \\"Musicology\\", that I had purchased any Prince music since \\"Sign O' the Times\\".  To be fair, I did love the music that came from \\"Prince & The New Power Generation\\", I just neglected to purchase  it.<br /><br />To say that this album is the Prince of old is, in my honest opinion, overshooting it.  He'll never be that guy again.  He's grown, and had life experiences like we all have.  I appreciate this album already more than I did \\"Musicology\\" which I liked as well, but it's no \\"Purple Rain\\".<br /><br />I listened to this album as soon as I got it from beginning to end, uninterrupted.  I've listened to it several times since.  With each replay, I seem to like the songs more and more.  On first listen, you might be looking for the \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" track, or an epic song like \\"Purple Rain\\", or maybe even a could-be classic like \\"When Doves Cry\\".  Are any that good?  Only time will tell.<br /><br />You don't have to be a Prince fanatic to enjoy this CD, you just need to be open to the experience.  And oh yes, it's a good one.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|Jonathan Safran Foer's widely read novel 'Everything is Illuminated' was a zany concoction of story, standup comedy, and fantasy that worked well as a diversion because of Foer's very apparent rough style of writing: everything is forgiven if the words play with the imagination.  But as a film the book seemed a formidable undertaking.  Liev Schreiber, a consummate actor, adapted Foer's book for the screen, performing major surgery on the tale, and then directed his version with great skill.  The result is a film that always entertains but that also crosses lines between reality and fantasy, writer's intentions vs screenwriter's needs, and story manipulation that may please some and frustrate those who loved the book.<br /><br />Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) is a collector of familial trinkets who sets out to the Ukraine to discover teasers of how his Jewish grandfather escaped annihilation in the Ukraine at the kindness of one Augustine (Tereza Veselkova). Once in the Ukraine he hires a tour guide Alex (Eugene Hutz) who with his 'blind' grandfather (Boris Leskin) as driver and their bizarre dog Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. to take him to Trachimbrod, the site where Foer's grandfather knew Augustine.  It seems there is no such place, and the journey to wherever begins.  Alex mangles his English with malapropisms and strange word substitutions making his job as translator for Foer the high point of the road trip (as it made the original book the reason to read!).  The many entanglements the strange little group encounter in their drive results in finding the secrets Foer is seeking and he is able to return home satisfied with his journey.<br /><br />All this makes for an acceptable road trip comedy until Schreiber excises the bulk of the novel - the bits of history that make the eventual discovery of the truths Foer seeks more meaningful.  And while the novel never lets the comedy slip off line, the screenplay switches gears and makes the story another tender yet sad holocaust tale. But despite the completed film's ending, the DVD shows the plentiful scenes not included in the film, scenes that are as over the top and barking for laughter as Foer's crazy novel.  We should only be grateful that Schreiber has the sense to delete these costly production numbers, as they are indeed silly!<br /><br />Eugene Hutz (born in 1972 Yevhen Hudz in Kiev, Ukraine) is the true find of the film.  His 'acting experience' is solely as the 'front man for Gogol Bordello, a gypsy punk band fusing supercharged folk influences with a sideshow cabaret'.  But he manages the wildly maniacal yet strangely intuitive character and lines of Alex with great finesse. He is a treasure!  The rest of the cast is strong and the splendid musical score by Paul Cantelon and the cinematography by Matthew Libatique add immeasurably to the film.<br /><br />Though many may disagree with  Schrieber's manipulation of the book, few will be able to miss the fact that for a first outing as writer/director EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED is a fine start.  Three stars for the film in general, but a fourth star for the performances by Hutz and Leskin.  Grady Harp, March 06holocaust tale.

B0000035E7|4.0|Nirvana's first album is definitely harder and less poppy than Nevermind, although according to interviews songs like 'Polly' had already been written and could have made it onto this album except Sub Pop wanted to make sure this album sounded really hard to cater to the Sub Pop audience. <br /> <br />To correct a few mistakes in other reviews, this album was not recorded in a garage. It was recorded in a simple studio, recorded by Jack Endino for $600 who actually charged them for less hours than they spent in the studio. The $600 was put forth by second guitarist Jason Everman who didn't actually play on this album, but did play on the tour they went on to support it. He is listed as a bandmember though because they wanted him to feel like he was really in the band. <br /> <br />This album isn't as raunchy as In Utero, and it is more hard-rocking and less punk than Nevermind. In hindsight this album is a lot of Nirvana fans' favorite album because the songs on it are not so vastly overplayed like all of the ones on Nevermind and In Utero, and the songs are just a bit more raw, and not as perfectly polished as later Nirvana.

0930289234|5.0|WATCHMEN is simply amazing. So is just about everything else I've read by Alan Moore, for that matter.<br /><br />A truly adult, complex, multi-faceted story that engages on dramatic, philosophic, social, humorous, and spiritual levels, WATCHMEN does for the graphic novel what Dickens and Austen did for the non-graphic one.<br /><br />I've now read four of Moore's graphic novels (FROM HELL, WATCHMEN, V FOR VENDETTA, and LEAUGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN). They're all briliant (with the possible exception of LEAGUE), but I think WATCHMEN is the most accesible to a first-time reader of comics.<br /><br />If you've been afraid of getting your fingers smudged with ink  until now, WATCHMEN is the one that will have you buying handi-wipes.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Quite simply no one from Pink Floyd has had a successful solo career. I didn't expect this latest release from David to be anything better than his previous solo albums or Rodger's, or Nick's or Richard's. <br /> <br />The simple fact is when the four of these guys were together as Pink Floyd that is when they shined. <br /> <br />So why keep releasing solo albums? Probably to fight of boredom.  It can't be for money cause they are already setup for life. <br /> <br />Despite which member of Pink Floyd who you believe to be the heart and soul, none of the solo albums they have released compare to what the four of them created together as Pink Floyd.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Diana Krall can't win. Among jazz snobs she's criticized more for her cool blond looks than her musicianship, and now jazz ideologues deprecate her work because she released a Christmas album. But her stunning beauty aside, if you were blind and an honest critic you'd be charmed and intrigued by her distinctive time signatures and in love with her voice.  Diana Krall's musicianship and vocal styling just gets better with each successive release, and this album is no exception.<br /><br />As far as the diminution of her seriousness as a jazz artist because of releasing a Christmas album, here follows a partial list of jazz greats who have done the same thing: Nat Cole, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Mel Torme, Dinah Washington and Ella Fitzgerald. Those aren't good enough for you? Too \\"pop stylist\\" and not enough \\"jazz purist?\\" Okay, try on this list of jazz god-artists who also have released Christmas songs: Oscar Peterson, Ramsey Lewis, Louis Armstrong, Shirley Horn, Jimmy Smith, Bill Evans, and yes (jazz ultra-snobs begin eating ordure now) even John Coultrane (\\"Greensleeves\\").<br /><br />And so Verve wisely got Krall to pick the most overdone of Christmas songs that have been covered to death by thousands of others and see what she could do. The answer is that this album is excellent, brilliant, harmless, and fun that only a Jazz Grinch couldn't love. Tommy LiPuma and Diana Krall's production is stunning, and John Clayton's arrangements and the Clayton/Hamilton orchestra's execution is flawless.<br /><br />You'd think it would be hard to make \\"Jingle Bells\\" sound new, but Krall succeeds and makes a song I hate enjoyable. Her take on \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" invokes memories more black and white than snow and evergreen, and with the length of her notes and excellent phrasing and sustain invokes the aching futility at the root of the song in a way not heard since World War II. Only one other artist tops Krall's excellent jazz version of \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town,\\" and that artist works in the genre of rock and his name is Bruce Springsteen.<br /><br />Other selections are equally delightful, and the musicianship throughout is superb. This is an unapologetically excellent album for any jazz fan, and deserves heavy rotation at Christmas gatherings or just for yourself by the fire. If any of your Christmas guests is rude enough to says otherwise, keep a lump of coal handy and whip out Coultrane's \\"Greensleeves\\" for a pause to have them put a stocking in it, then follow it up with Krall's \\"Let it Snow\\" to keep the Christmas spirit in full 4/4 time.to Town,\\" and that artist works in the genre of rock and his name is Bruce Springsteen. <br /> <br />Other selections are equally delightful, and the musicianship throughout is superb.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|What can I say about Panic! At The Disco! I love them. They bring a mixture of music to our stereos with a tune to dance too. PATD is easy to listen to and will sure get you dancing. Their lyrics are mind blowing with even bringing techno into their music. With their songs not making alot of sense, it still sticks in your head and you want to listen to more. Panic! At The Disco: A Fever You Can't Sweat will be an album most people will enjoy.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|This was one of seven movies that I watched on board a long round trip Qantas airplane flight recently.<br /><br />The beginning half of the movie has some very funny moments and is a basic clash-of-cultures and fracturing-of-the-English language type comedy.<br /><br />Eugene Hutz, playing the role of an earnest Ukrainian tour guide, really steals the show and is terrific.  Mikki the dog, as the deranged \\"seeing eye b**tch\\" is also hilariously funny.<br /><br />Boris Leskin turns in a fine performance as the grandfather, but his role is unfortunately largely wasted as the story arc of his character takes some sudden, rather inexplicable turns that don't really add up.<br /><br />Elijah Wood is completely wasted in this role.  Somebody, probably the director or screenwriter, decided to put him in a black suit and large glasses for almost the entire movie, while wearing this constant look of solemn angst on his face.  His movements are almost catatonic, as he goes about collecting weird bits of mementos in plastic ziplock bags.<br /><br />Wood has tended to specialize in two types of characters, and in this movie, he comes across not like his sympathetic, humane Frodo (LOTR), or Leo Beiderman (Deep Impact), but ends up more like the creepy Kevin the Cannibal (Sin City), or Patrick the Girlfriend Stealer (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).  If you have ever watched Sin City, the picture of Wood with the large reflective glasses on the DVD cover will definitely remind you of Kevin the Cannibal.  And unfortunately, that's what I had in mind as I was watching this movie.<br /><br />The cinematography is beautiful in parts.  Reading the many five star reviews, it is apparent that the most appealing aspects of this movie to most people are its themes of remembrance for the victims of Nazi aggression in this part of the world, plus its rare Hollywood look at the Eastern European world.<br /><br />But, I'm not from that part of the world, and those themes just don't resonate that deeply with me.  On its own merits as entertainment, this movie was funny in the first half, sad in the second half, and the two parts just don't mesh well together.  Throw in a creepy, catatonic Elijah Wood who looks vaguely like Kevin the Cannibal, and the movie REALLY doesn't mesh or resonate.<br /><br />The best part of the movie, and the only thing that I've bought, was the CD for \\"How It Ends\\", by the band Dvotchka (an American band originally from Denver, despite its Russian name).  The title song was used for the promotional trailer for this movie but was not part of the movie soundtrack.

0385486804|5.0|The synopsis on the cover of this book practically grabbed me by the collar, pinned me against the wall, and shoved the story into my face.  By the time I finished the last page, less than 24 hours had passed from when I started it--I couldn't put the book down.   <br /> <br />The author writes in a straightforward style, which makes the book easy to read, and when combined with the interesting story it tells you can plow through this book in a day or two.  It's nonfiction with a twist of mystery and a dash of suspense, which is what kept my interest so strong thoughout the book.  It's also very open to interpretation and can really make you think about things.  Was the guy on the right track, or was he a complete idiot? <br /> <br />Anyone who has ever heard the call of the open road will probably find this book interesting.  I would easily rank it in the top five books I've read in the past year or two.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|Yet another movie that I sat through on board this long airline flight...<br /><br />Basically, the movie plays backwards, in bits and pieces.  The story is a of a man with no ability to form new memories who is nevertheless obsessed with seeking revenge against the killers of his wife.  And all the screwups he makes as a result.<br /><br />As the story unwinds and we find out more and more of the stories of the various people flashing through the life of this man, we also find out that EVERYBODY in the movie is a bad guy/gal, except perhaps the murdered wife.  And so at the end of the movie, there is simply this empty feeling of disaffection for all of the characters and the movie as a whole.<br /><br />And I have a headache, probably from being into the 10th hour of sleep deprivation on this airplane flight, but also probably from having just solved the tortuous mental puzzle of this  movie and then realizing, oh, geez, what a waste of time that was.  Well, if you are stuck on an airplane and it comes free with the flight, maybe it isn't quite that bad.  Hence two stars instead of one.  But I wouldn't watch this movie again if I had better things to do.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Compared to System of a Down's last four albums, this one is probably the most deeply harmonic.  The music has a depth that their other albums didn't have.  This is displayed in Dreaming with a counter melody in the background for example.  This album has a stronger eastern sound to it as well.  Although the sound of the music is more refined, their craziness continues. <br /> <br />On the other side though, this album didn't end quite like Mesmerize had.  Mesmerize, in my opinion, was organized perfectly and gave the listener a feeling of peace even after listening to screaming earlier in the album.  Hypnotize almost had that but it ended with a bit more of a weight on your shoulders afterwards.  But I guessing that was the idea. <br /> <br />Attack--Opens the album nicely with a great balance of harmony and insanity. <br /> <br />Dreaming--This song has a great level of depth and transitions beautifully into and out of the chorus. <br /> <br />Kill Rock & Roll--Harmony is still definitely present but this is a great example of SOAD's ambiguous lyrics. <br /> <br />Hypnotize--Beautiful song with a great balance between Malakian and Tankian. <br /> <br />Stealing Society--This song had a different sound to it.  For some reason it makes me think of the 70s.  This one is just hard to describe. <br /> <br />Tentative--This one seemed a little bit rougher.  The vocals, although again exercising harmony, seemed to be pushing the edge of being out of tune a few times throughout.  Also, the yelling was pushing it when transitioning from calm to fast.  In about the middle of the song, it changes style for a little bit and poses a question \\"Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?\\" <br /> <br />U-Fig--This is an entertaining song.  It starts out with them yelling, \\"Melt in the sun! Melt in the sun!\\"  But the sound changes and they exercise some fast talk with the words \\"Beat 'em\\" over and over.  You can't help but to smile.  The song continues going from harmonic semi-sanity to screaming to melt in the sun.  Once again, this is a great song for entertainment. <br /> <br />Holy Mountains--This song seems to be a lot like their earlier music such as in Toxicity and Steal This Album.  It's an example of what would happen if you mixed Aerials and BYOB together.  Try to imagine that. <br /> <br />Vicinity of Obscenity--One word: Insane.  This one comes up to the level of This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm In This Song but doesn't go all the way.  But yelling banana and terracotta a whole bunch sure gets close.  This one is definitely entertaining. <br /> <br />She's Like Heroine--This one was never a favorite of mine but is still alright in my book.  The lyrics are a bit off the wall but kind of entertaining (\\"...he wants nothing less//than to wear a little dress.\\") <br /> <br />Lonely Day--Malakian does a good job singing in this song and doesn't have that shreeky vocal style he usually performs with.  Harmony is really present in this song. <br /> <br />Soldier Side--A decent enough ending to the album.  Eastern sounding guitar work is present in this song.  It really makes you think about how war affects the people in it. <br /> <br />Over all, it's a good CD.  It's not my personal favorite but it would be a good CD for anyone new to System of a Down.  Their music seems a bit more mainstream than in the past but it's still a good listen.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I guess part of the secret behind the success of this movie - on the artistic front - is that it's not really to say whether it wants to pay homage to Star Trek or make fun of it. A bit of both, I suppose. Hidden in what would be an unusually stupid and cheesy plot is a group of splendidly talented actors, completely out of place - and possibly therefore doing their characters perfect. Who would ever imagine Sigourney Weaver as the extremely blond crew member with extremely tight fitting suit showing her, well, very womanly forms - whoes only job on the ship is to repeat what the computer sais? The last detail was one I found priceless. <br /> <br />Another fine detail is the absolute irony in the extremely low-budget look of the equipment the main characters have and the aliens in their human forms - especially their ridiculous suites - and then the absolutely breath taking special effects used on the aliens when they are in outer space. <br /> <br />Against all odds, this movie just WORKS! If I should compare it to anything, it would be The Fifth Element, but unlike the former, this movie never really got the attention at the box office it desserved. Which is not to say that this movie is less good than the former! Don't miss it.

0743454537|3.0|I wish I could give this book a rating of 5 stars.  It was definately the type of book that you can't put down after you start to read it.  If not for the ending, I would consider this book an EXCELLENT read! <br /> <br />I'm writing this review to serve as a warning to those who are considering it:  It has a very unexpected, frustrating and sad ending.  I did NOT enjoy the ending.  I don't understand why the author chose to go that route, and when I read her explanation of it, it didn't seem like much of an explanation. <br /> <br />The ending ruined the book for me.  It felt like the book lead you through so much just to dump you at the end with a huge feeling of emptiness.
B000002ADT|2.0|This is what happens when you have complete control of your music making but don't actually have any musical ideas.  Davis was the epitome of self absorbtion and should be most famous for his opinion that \\"white players can't play on the beat, they're always behind it.\\" And while apologists like Herbie Hancock might claim Davis didn't turn his back on the audience, \\"he was conducting the band.\\" It's kind of hard to conduct when you're simultaneously playing your trumpet with your eyes closed. Maybe if his music equalled his legend then it would be easier to accept excuses for him.
1592401791|5.0|When it comes to books about The Beatles, they usually fall in one of two categories: \\"memoirs\\" and \\"archives\\" (including timelines, analysis, photos, recording info, etc). Now Geoff Emerick has joined the throe of Beatles authors by publishing his account that actually falls in between the memoir/archive genre. His new book \\"HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE-My Life Recording the Music of The Beatles\\" is no \\"cash in\\", but a valuable insight to the workings of the group. While there are no real \\"Beatles revelations\\" contained other than those that true Beatle aficionados already know, such as the working title of the \\"White Album\\", John's accidental acid trip on the rooftop of EMI etc), the true value of this book is the first hand observances of the Beatles in their most important environment: the recording studio!<br /><br />Some people are lucky enough to realize their \\"calling\\" early in life - and Geoff Emerick was one of those lucky few. An early love of music caused a natural fascination with the mechanics behind recording. His experiments with tape recording and his persistence led him to a job at EMI! While Geoff Emerick wasn't the Beatles recording engineer during their early years at EMI (he started as an assistant engineer), his employment there did grant him occasional views of The Beatles at work during the time of 1962-1966 when Norman Smith was their engineer. However, when Smith left to become a producer (going on to produce Pink Floyd's first two albums at EMI) it was Emerick who was promoted to the position of Beatles' engineer. So, Emerick was there during the true renaissance of the Beatles studio years: Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, (part of) The White Album, and Abbey Road.<br /><br />What about Let It Be, you ask? Well, it is well documented how bad tensions were during the recording of The White Album, prompting Ringo Starr to be the first Beatle to quit the group at the time. Further evidence of the bad feelings during this album can be seen in the departure of Emerick - he also quit halfway through the recording (but unlike Ringo, didn't come back for the album). So, he missed the whole Let It Be fiasco, until being asked to return for Abbey Road. He went on to design the Beatles personal recording studio, which sadly wasn't finished in time for The Beatles to actually use!<br /><br />As witness to one of the Beatles first recording sessions (\\"How Do You Do It?\\"), Emerick paints a fascinating picture of the individual dynamics and personalities of each Beatle in the recording studio. Paul was the easiest to get along with, a true workaholic in the studio who, curiously enough was pegged as \\"the leader\\" by Emerick during the early sessions. John was often impatient, but curiously enough - it was always a new Lennon song that was first recorded for each new album session! Later, John's impatience actually paid off when they discovered they were one song short for completion of Revolver - they quickly finished John's \\"She Said She Said\\". Other tales include a funny story of the \\"fan siege\\" during the recording of \\"She Loves You\\" in which fans were running loose at EMI - which gave Emerick a first-hand view of Beatlemania and he comments that this \\"atmosphere\\" seemed to lend to the electricity of the recording. George Harrison was probably the least 'at ease' in the recording studio and had problems nailing his solos, such as his solo on \\"A Hard Day's Night\\". Ringo was basically quiet in the studio.<br /><br />I read as quickly as possible to get to the Revolver/Sgt. Pepper recording sessions, and Emerick's descriptions did not disappoint! I was in Beatles heaven hearing how each song was recorded and the whole spirit of invention that went into Beatles' records - not just by the Beatles themselves, but by Emerick's ingenious solutions to the seemingly impossible requests of the Beatles, especially John. It was Emerick who came up with a solution for Lennon, who wanted his voice to sound like the \\"Dahlai Lama chanting from a mountaintop\\" on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". His solution? Using a Leslie speaker(Which rotates) to achieve the proper effect on John's voice. Also, in regards to Revolver, I wasn't aware that the tape trick (cutting up random bits of tape and putting them back together) that George Martin used on \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" was first used on \\"Yellow Submarine\\"!<br /><br />Of course, Sgt. Pepper was the pinnacle of the Beatles collective studio experimentation and it is amazing to hear the casual attitude the Beatles had during the sessions - it being the very first time that they weren't under any time restraints. George Harrison's lack of participation in this groundbreaking album is discussed. Fresh from his trip to India, George just wasn't interested, especially with Paul taking a lot of the lead guitar breaks and his first contribution to Pepper (\\"Only a Northern Song\\") being kindly put aside. The mysterious, still unreleased Beatles song, \\"Carnival of Light\\" (recorded during a five-hour session that also included vocal overdubs for the then-unreleased \\"Penny Lane\\") is discussed.<br /><br />It is amazing how the Beatles went from the happy, creative Pepper sessions to the dreary White Album sessions in just one year! While Emerick left EMI for Apple, he avoided the bad scenes of the White Album and Let It Be, to concentrate on building the Beatles recording studio. However, he did get to attend one Phil Spector Let It Be session and his observations are contained within the book. Finally, the Beatles swan song, Abbey Road is detailed, from John's sometimes lack of interest (and Yoko's bed being brought into the studio!) to George's emergence as a studio talent.<br /><br />Geoff Emerick went on to win a total of 3 Grammy awards for his Beatles work. While most of the book concentrates on The Beatles, he does mention some of his other projects, such as Paul McCartney's Band on the Run, as well as his work with The Zombies and Elvis Costello. Finally, he comes full circle with his involvement with the \\"Threetles\\" reunion sessions for the Beatles Anthology.<br /><br />\\"HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE-My Life Recording the Music of The Beatles\\" is truly a Beatles' book that delivers!

B000001FTJ|4.0|It's definitely the 70's, the 80's, the 90's and the 2000's with Tom.  Well, One From the Heart soundtrack was 1981 but musically belongs with his 70's work.  This album is the start of his distincly new 80's sound which did not correspond to radio 80's music.  Tom began to use an organ and have a more jangly sound with more exotic noises.  It was like he left the seedy downtown district and took a musical journey to New Orleans.  For me, the 90's period is way too dark and stark, Black Rider, Alice and even Mule Variations.<br /><br />  I gotta admit, it took me a coupla years to fully appreciate his shift.  At first I missed that smokey lounge sound.  But some of these songs, and many from his other 80's work: Rain Dogs, Franks Wild Years and Big Time were more quality numbers from a skilled, word wise, emotional artist.<br /><br />  Here's songs that really stand out for me on this album: Shore Leave really tells a tale.  You go with him on shore leave and feel his separation and one of his most memorable lines, \\"Look up and see that same moon that shines on you in Illinois\\".<br /><br />16 Shells From A Thirty-Ought Six is pretty catchy, sort of the equivilent of a beat song that finds its groove and takes you along whether you signed up or not.<br /><br />In The Neighborhood is a real hit that likely has virtually never been played on the radio.  It's a natural take on the neighborhood, the highs and the lows.  Delightful song.  Very catchy, sweet.<br /><br />Down, Down, Down is another song that just finds its groove and goes.<br /><br />Soldier's Things is one of his most moving songs.  A veteran selling his medals, \\"for a dollar in this box\\".  Few songs can take you to this emotional place.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are all respectable.  I don't fast forward through any of them.  Those 'hits' really stand out for me.  Interestingly, for me at least, as the decades have passed having been into him since 1974, I now prefer the 80's material only because the textures are more complex than his 70's work.  As the years pass I tend to continue to enjoy music that isn't predictable.  I know where every 70's song is going.  But his 80's work twists and turns and makes noises where I don't expect it to and that, sometimes, I don't even know what it is.

However, there's some songs on here that are some of his best ever:<br /><br />Somewhere is one of the great covers of all time.  He finds all the emotion in this song.  Stunning.<br /><br />Red Shoes he's done for years live.  Nice.<br /><br />Christmas Card From A Hooker In Minneapolis is a true story taking us in the mail from brave face to honesty.  Touching.<br /><br />Romeo Is Bleeding is one of his finest songs.  Period.  A touch of Spanish, almost a West Side Story feel to the song.  This song always moves me when I hear it.<br /><br />A Sweet Little Bullet From A Pretty Blue Gun.  I love the sound of this song.  The title is typical of his way with words that sound even better in the context of his unique musical style.<br /><br />Blue Valentines is another song with heart.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this album first.  If you want a 70's Tom Waits album get either Heart of Saturday Night or Small Change or Nighthawks at the Diner first.  If/when you love any or all three of them, then you have permission to get this and Heart Attack and Vine, two solid but less consistent albums.  chrisbct@hotmail.com
6305428522|4.0|That TV-stations always have played a dubious role in the selection of their candidates isn't anything new.  In the late 1950's, an idealistic young lawyer who works for a Congressional subcommittee discovers that game shows aren't always played honestly. He focuses on two contestants on the show 21 and finds evidence for the fact that NBC and the sponsor have been screwing with the system.  If you only want one reason why you shouldn't miss this movie than I would definitely say that you should watch it for the acting. John Turturro is excellent as the Jewish, seemingly media crazy Stempel. But Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren, Rob Morrow as the lawyer,... all did a fine job as well. In fact, I find it very hard to say which actor did the best job, because I liked them all.  All in all this is a very good movie that deserves to be seen for many different reasons. Some very good acting, a nice script, good direction... this movie has it all. The only problem that I had with it was that it was a bit of a slow starter. But don't let that be a reason not to watch it. It's a very fine movie.
B00004T9VY|5.0|What's the true test of whether an album is a masterpiece?  How does it sound 30, 40 years later.  That's how.  I hadn't heard this album in over 15 years and heard it recently.  I got tears on some songs.  I was swept away with every song.  I was totally immersed in every single song.  There's no weak links here.  Another true test of a classic.  This it.  And after this album, the second one is half great and after that he just walks away from greatness.  This is the album to have.<br /><br />Where Do The Children Play?  He asks it so plaintifully.<br /><br />Hard Headed Woman, Wild World and Sad Lisa are each enjoyable and little gems on their own.<br /><br />Miles From Nowhere.  How does he do it?  Each song is written lyrically and musically as if born whole.<br /><br />But I Might Die Tonight.  More story.  Told in perfect music.<br /><br />Longer Boats is so boistrous.<br /><br />On The Road To Find Out takes us.<br /><br />Father And Son.  I get totally choked up every time I hear this.<br /><br />Tea For The Tillerman.  A magnificent song.<br /><br />If you don't own this album, do yourself a favor, get it.  If this isn't a masterpiece, I don't know what is.  Another way to say that is, this could be the greatest album ever made and I'm a giant hardcore punk rock fan! chrisbct@hotmail.com
6305137293|4.0|Halloween 2 is a solid sequel to the 1978 horror classic Halloween directed by horror legend John Carpenter. Some sequels of the horror genre especially during the 80's failed desperatley compared to the epic original as we saw with the The Excorcist 2, but that is not the case here. <br /> <br />Even though Halloween 2 wasn't released till 1981; 3 years after the original this movie is supposed to be a continuation of the 1st. It takes place later on the same night as the original. Babysitter, Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) is rushed to the hospital and treated for the injuries she recieved in her first encounter with Micheal. <br /> <br />Micheal, who mysteriously dissapeared after being shot off the balcony by Dr. Loomis ( Donald Pleasence ) continues after Laurie tracing her to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital and doing a few classic Halloween style stalk and slash routines along the way with the now even more obsessed Dr. Loomis trying to track him down. <br /> <br />Halloween 2 uses the slow building tension and suspense from the first film, and adds in the gore, blood, and unique more explicite kills that the first movie lacked. It also reveals the back story of Micheal being Laurie's brother which was a good, well explained twist for the movie. Also, the large seemingly empty hospital filled with unsuspecting nurses and poor traumatized Laurie teamed with the original bone chilling music from the first adds to the movie's suspense and chill factor. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers another excellent performance proving that she can do more than just scream and run in the numerous first rate and nail biting chase scenes this movie provides but that she can also act, alot better than most other actresses of the 80's slasher genre. <br /> <br />The movie is well paced and well directed by Rick Rosenthal..good from beginning to end, and in the shadow of a legend a worthy sequel and an all around good slasher flick.

0307263118|5.0|John Banville's award winning \\"The Sea\\" is an evocative look at one's past and its presence in the present and future. The novel is written in skilful prose that uses a lot of adjectives to set the mood and the nostalgic tone of the narrative. The writer also relies on plastic arts as a reference to bring to this story pictorial image that sometimes looks like a foggy dream.<br /><br />Throughout the narrative Banville makes his main character Max Morden a believable person that is trapped in a past that he can't quit. His most recurrent memory is one summer when he met the Grace family, and how he was fascinated by them -- mostly by the two teenage-twins, Myles and Chloe. As he became more and more close to this people, his own life seemed to be drown in a spiral of love and desire. Years later, he comes back to that idyllic village, what brings back many memories.<br /><br />Banville trusts in his prose to bring his reader Max's feelings and emotions -- therefore, much is said, and mostly in a poetic tone. What for some can be a blessing, for others can be dreadful. It only depends on how much the reader is interested in learning about how colorful things happened instead of how and why they happened.<br /><br />To create a powerful image, the writer is always evocating famous painters and their work -- mostly Bonnard. The result is usually magic since the reader has a source from where have the idea of the picture Banville is trying to create. On the other hand, sometimes the prose reads very artificial and purposely labored.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Sea\\" has a positive result -- it is a beautiful book with a powerful story (that gets better near the end) --, but at the same time one has the feeling that English lingo writers have produced better books in 2005 -- Ian McEwan's \\"Saturday\\", and Zadie Smith's \\"On Beauty\\", to name a few -- that deserved to take the Man Booker Prize. It seems that judges preferred the supposedly beautiful form, that never connects to the real world, to powerful novels that brought up current social-political issues.connects to the real world, to powerful novels that brought up current social-political issues.  <br />
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Michael Jackson is the greatest artist of our time. This is a very nice collection of hits. But it does not include all of the Number One Hits.

It should of been a two disc collection, with all of these songs included. I still play this CD, to this day, when i'm in the mood for Michael Jacksons major hits.
B00005JLEU|5.0|\\"Spirited Away\\", the first Japanese anime movie to win both an Oscar and other worldwide awards, is also one of the most unique and beautifully made animated movies you'll ever see. <br />The acknowledged masterpiece of Hayao Miyazaki, Japan's most successful director (animated or live) ever, it's a novel fantasy about the unusual and spiritual journey of a tiny, shy girl. <br />        Miyazaki, who draws, writes and oversees every single detail of this and his other films, always creates a small but strong girl as his central character. Chihiro, withdrawn and poker-faced, has that role here, as she wanders away from her suburban parents when they discover a lavish buffet in what looks to be an abandoned temple. Within minutes, she's swept inside by a mysterious, master-type boy named Haku and discovers a wondrous but creepy bathhouse crawling with strange spiritual creatures- a place where humans are not welcome. Inside, she encounters everything from tiny moving ash particles with eyes to <br />a truly repulsive sludge monster emerging from a dirty tub. Chihiro also has her name stolen by Yubaba, the weird, wacky sorceress who runs the place, and must be known as \\"Sen\\" until she meets one test after another, the better to eventually escape and become a girl again. It's this journey that the movie centers on- not unlike a Japanese take on \\"Alice In Wonderland\\". <br />But it's also much more. <br />        Unlike the average American animated feature, \\"Spirited Away\\" runs two hours, yet it unfolds like origami. The few human characters are drawn and speak like real, frightened kids, yet with dignity as well. The unusual spirits, resembling everything from mutant kabuki to- of all things- \\"Looney Tunes\\"' Michigan J. Frog, usually don't speak yet say as much, if not more, as those gabby scare-factory things from \\"Monsters Inc.\\" Miyazaki doesn't believe in drowning the screen- or the audience- in rat-a-tat dialogue; instead, he draws simple, family-minded morals in a most appealing, visually stunning way. He also has a gifted composer-conductor, Joe Hisaishi, who backs the movie with both his own meditative piano solos and some exotic, Martin Denny- <br />style orchestration. The visual, character, and musical elements all meld into an atmosphere that's both simple and sophisticated, <br />uniquely Japanese yet welcoming to all. <br />         For this American release, Disney took special care to keep the entire movie untouched yet create an English soundtrack that fit in perfectly- not an easy thing to do when dubbing over Japanese-speaking mouths. Two bonus features show this process quite well, a tribute to the fine work of both the couple who translated the Miyazaki script into clear English and the gifted voice cast. The best of the latter are Daveigh Chase (from \\"Lilo and Stitch\\"), the youngster who captures Chihiro with the heartfelt shyness she was drawn with, and Suzanne Pleshette, who gave Yubaba- and her \\"good witch\\" sister- a charming, gravelly cackle that does Margaret Hamilton proud.  <br />          There's also a documentary from Nippon TV (in Japanese with subtitles) that follows Miyazaki- an avuncular, chain-smoking patriarch- and his team of animators, sound men, musicians and actors as they create \\"Spirited Away\\" from the director's original sketchbook to the screen. Even with no English, the process at Ghibli is as fascinating as the movie itself- old-school, hand-drawn animation all the way with a distinct flavor, a wonderful craft in this computer-driven age. <br />         If, like me, you're a serious animation buff, or if you're younger and like classic Disney or \\"Harry Potter\\" but aren't sure about anime, or even if you like \\"Lord of the Rings\\" but won't go near a \\"cartoon\\", you'll really like \\"Spirited Away\\"- truly a product of the magical mind of Miyazaki.
B00005J6T0|5.0|This is Madonna's best album of all time.Her album with the most hits as well.My favorite track on this album is \\"La Isla Bonita\\".I am glad she still sings this song at all of her current shows.\\"Papa Don't Preach\\" is classic Madonna at her best, I wish she would still sing this one. \\"Open Your Heart\\" is another classic,It is still a favorite among Madonna fans. The titled cut, is a teeny pop song but its still an awesome track,it's probably my second favorite track on the album. \\"Live To Tell\\",another great ballad from Madonna. \\"Where's The Party\\" is a very underated song that should of been a single, it would of guaranteed Madonna another place in the Top 10. The remaining two tracks \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" and \\"Love Makes The World Go Round\\" are just good but not single material type. This album still remains Madonna's biggest selling studio album, Make sure you pick up your copy today!

B00000269M|5.0|Michael Jackson's follow up to Thriller...I am in no way a disappointed....This album is amazing..This is the first album to have 5 #1 singles from one album....also the first to debut by a male artist....RIAA Count 8 platinum but RIAA has not updated the status of its certification...and the album as sold over 10 million in the US... <br /> <br />1.

B00005Q66T|3.0|Madonna's second greatest hits album and it's does not live up to his name. I know if you are going to release a single disc of hits, you might have to leave some songs out, but this should be way different then how it turned out. If I were to put out a greatest hits album for her, it would start with the first hit in 1992 &#34;This Used To be My Playground&#34; to the hit in 2001 &#34;What It Feels Like For A Girl&#34;.
B0009353IW|5.0|At this point in his amazing career, Ry Cooder could have put out Buena Vista Social Club, The Sequel, and few would have said a harsh word about it.  Instead, we have \\"Chavez Ravine\\", a work of tremendous ambition and scope.  I'm sure it gave his record company some heartburn when he showed up with this one! <br /> <br />There are certainly highlights: David Hidalgo on \\"Onda Callejera\\", the tremendously funky \\"Muy Fifi\\", the reggae tinged \\"Los Chucos Suaves\\", and the tender \\"In My Town\\".  \\"Chinito Chinito\\" is a blast.  \\"El UFO Cayo\\"........well, just listen.  But \\"Chavez Ravine\\" is a cohesive work, a start-at-the-beginning-and-go-straight-through thing.  Don't download it; buy it.  Many of the lyrics are in Spanish, but the excellent liner notes provide translation, as well as some insight into this project. <br /> <br />Once again, Ryland works with aging master musicians just before their final curtain call.  While he has been accused of exploitation, I'll bet you'd have a hard time finding one of these musicians that would complain about being \\"exploited\\".  As the Buena Vista movie demonstrated, Ry realizes just how lucky he is, and aims to make the most of it.  The guy is a national treasure.  \\"Chavez Ravine\\" is thoroughly enjoyable, yet challenging.  I can't wait to see where he travels next.

B000001GK9|5.0|As several reviewers have already noted, this is among the best recordings available of Mahler's 9th. The orchestral playing in the fourth movement is simply stunning. I had a lot of trouble deciding which recording of this piece to buy. I listened to several, including the legendary Bernstein/Concertgebouw and historical Bernstein/Berlin. I chose this one for its flowing beauty. Of course it's really a matter of personal taste--neither of these recordings is a bad choice. If you like spending money on cds, buy all three.
0143036556|4.0|Diamond studies the rise and fall of civilizations and won the Pulitzer Prize for his earlier book, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\\" I bought Collapse on impulse, based on the author's reputation, but without any specific expectations. Turns out, this is a remarkable tour de force, exploring the decisions societies make and the impact those decisions have over the years. <br /> <br />Diamond gives a detailed history of twelve societies, ranging from modern Montana's experience with mining, ranching and tourism, to ancient Mayan culture, the rise and fall of Easter island, Viking exploration and settlements, the development of Australia, and modern China. His writing is excellent and I was surprised at how well he made the various cultures come alive for me, but the sheer volume of detail was over-whelming at times. This is a massive book which rewards the reader with a wealth of information in exchange for a fair amount of time and effort. <br /> <br />The element I was not prepared for was Diamond's continuous emphasis on environmental factors in societal development. By professional training, he is a biologist and his point of view is shaped by his perceptions of deforestation, soil erosion, water and climate change on societal survival. Despite repeated attempts to balance his own argument, I found a strong element of environmental determinism running through the book. I don't have the professional background to agree or disagree with his analysis, but at times I became frustrated. It's as if the ratio of trees per person, or the tons of soil erosion per year are the primary (if not the only) factors that determine whether a society survives or dies. <br /> <br />If in the coming years, experts and the general public judge Diamond to be essentially correct, this book will have an even greater impact than Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\" (1962) and Diamond will have a profound impact on our perceptions of climate change, environment protection and economic development. Ifon the other hand, his analysis is viewed as simplistic and one-dimensional, he will be viewed as merely an alarmist. I am not educated enough to have a strong opinion either way and will leave the determination to others. <br /> <br />I will make three essential points, however. First, this is an important book because it will be a source of discussion among elite decision-makers in the coming years. Informed people should read it. Second, it's a delightful introduction to the twelve cultures he studies. It's fun and enriching. I kept thinking of the quote that \\"those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.\\" Third, his comments about current events in Rwanda, Australia and China are insightful and haunting. His analysis is troubling, and (particularly regarding the genocide in Rwanda) his suggestions may be be disastrously prophetic about the future of sub-Saharan Africa and the American Southwest.  <br /> <br />This is not an \\"easy\\" book. It's massive and requires real commitment, but it's worth the effort. Whether you agree or disagree, opinion leaders (and those who wish to be opinion leaders) will be discussing it. Highly recommended.

Included are necessities like toothbrushes, packs of cards, pencils, etc. I did a fundraiser to buy books as well, and then came the hard part, choosing books which would appeal to every child under the worst kind of stress.  <br /> <br />I picked The Witches for the upper elementary group. It's funny, exciting, and scary.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|It's always refreshing around awards season to witness a performance by an actress that you know is going to make a big impression. In Transamerica, Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman just astounds, in a feat of acting that is nothing short of extraordinary. This is a poignant and often deliriously funny road-trip film and Huffman sinks her teeth into playing a sensitive, yet conflicted preoperative transsexual with such a refreshing candor that most viewers will be just blown away by the film.  <br /> <br />The film marks an auspicious debut for writer-director Duncan Tucker, who spins a marvelous tale of a reluctant but curious dad who learns he has a son. The dad, however is soon to become a woman, and is now decked out in tasteful and chic pastels, but the film cleverly avoids the clich's, thanks to Tucker's sensitive hand and the subtle work of Huffman and the rest of the pitch-perfect cast, especially Kevin Zegers as the lost-and-found offspring.  <br /> <br />Huffman plays Bree/Stanley a self-contained preoperative transsexual who lives in her little Los Angeles bungalow, and works as a waitress in a local colourful Mexican restaurant. We first meet her a week before she is to have her gender reassignment surgery and her closest friend is her compassionate and kindly therapist, Margaret (Elizabeth Pena).  <br /> <br />But just before the ultimate surgical step is due to take place, she receives a phone call from a 17-year-old New York inmate, who claims to be Stanley's son. Of course, Bree has come too far to let anything derail her surgery - she is so single-minded that she dismisses the unwanted disruption. However, when Margaret learns of the phone call and her patient's offspring, she refuses to OK the medical procedure until Bree goes to New York to address the matter.  <br /> <br />Bree flies East to help the boy, who has run away from home after his mother's suicide. Allowing him to think that she is a Christian missionary - her upright, churchly bearing makes it easy to believe - she decides to take him back to rural Kentucky, where his stepfather lives. She buys a chartreuse station wagon to drive Toby cross-country, but Toby, rather than returning to Kentucky, wants to go to Los Angles where he expects to find his father living large and hopes to break into movies -- of the San Fernando Valley sort.  <br /> <br />The film is full of unexpected twists and turns, as Bree and Toby traverse the country eating in homey little roadside cafes, staying in comfy hotels, and even camping out. Soon they're developing an uncommon and strangely likable bond. This is the land where banjos and acoustic guitars compete with the crickets and loons, and along the way they meet a variety of characters from a free-spirited vegan hitcher (Grant Monohon) to a gentlemanly New Mexico rancher (Graham Greene) who gallantly comes to Bree's assistance, more than a bit smitten.  <br /> <br />It is only after an incident on the road that the couple is forced to confront Bree's parents in their kitsch Phoenix mansion. Her father, Murray (Burt Young), is an easygoing fellow in loose-fitting linen, but it is her mother, Elizabeth (the astonishing Fionnula Flanagan), who commands our attention. With her peroxide curls, silk pantsuits and heavy makeup, she might be an aging movie diva, and she has the volatile temperament to prove it. She's absolutely repulsed by her son's new look, but underneath the cold exterior, she's desperately trying to understand him.  <br /> <br />The performances are all astounding, but this is Huffman's movie, and she totally steals the show, brilliantly embodying the complex layers of self-awareness and denial. She's prim and proper, but also raw and gutsy, and although she may not yet have totally got womanhood right, she's a lovely, sensitive kind hearted person, who we all know will end up being an absolutely gorgeous woman. It is not just that the actress plays a man who plays a woman, but also that shemust impersonate a performer in the midst of learning a complicated role. Her performance is a complex metamorphosis - it is thrilling to watch and was the real Best Actress performance of 2005. <br /> <br />As she each day she paints on a face and puts on a voice to become more truly herself, her uneasy self-consciousness is a constant, especially when a child's innocent but discerning question plunges Bree into despair. As a boy who is tempted by cheap drugs and uses the art of seduction to get his way, Zegers conveys Toby's essential sweetness and hunger for real affection, making him much more than just a vain or damaged kid.  <br /> <br />But what makes Transamerica one of the year's best films is the sensitive and intuitive way that Tucker presents the world of transexualism. He never judges Bree, or preaches, and throughout the story there is much to be learned about the history and place transsexuals once had in society. The astute and intelligent script weaves laugh-out-loud humor into his characters' longing for acceptance, but most importantly, the director treats Bree as a fully rounded person, with all her quirks, insecurities and foibles, rather than some kind of objective, and scientific case study.

B000002UB3|5.0|Perfection from the greatest band of all time - no one comes close. It's mind boggling how good these guys were.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|This is the second release by actor Jared Leto's band, and unlike other bands that include a popular actor this is a real band (Dogstar I'm looking at you). 30 Seconds To Mars is a better than average rock band with an industrial slant. However, the lyrics seem a bit trite and the music is a bit too clean for the look and style they're trying. My favorite song on the disc is \\"The Fantasy\\", which is nicely done and a step above the other tunes. I think this is better than a majority of the crap that gets released out there and since it features an actor I really like, I give it a few bonus points.  <br />-- The ChickenFish Speaks
B000068TPN|5.0|The main thing that sticks with me after watching this excellent depiction of the early days of the Vietnam War is towards the end of the movie (after the battle) when the press helicopter lands and all the reporters gather around Gibson and the other soldiers and start asking inane questions. It just seemed so jarring and surreal. I mean what the hell do you even say after an experience like that. I kept thinking, in regards to the reporters, that they so couldn't even understand ... and I was only watching the battle (in the comfort of my living room), not fighting in it!!  <br /> <br />That's realistic moviemaking when I as a viewer felt like I was part of the experience.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|i've been a fan of these guys for almost 4 years now, and i'll be the first one to tell you that i wasn't too happy with their \\"new sound\\" but the first song i heard was \\"Beast and the Harlot\\" and \\"Bat Country.\\" luckly the rest of the album was great :] <br /> <br />Best tracks include Sidewinder and The Wicked End, some of the best guitar solos ever. Sidewinder includes lead guitarist, Synyster Gates' father on acoustic towards the end. amazing. and The Wicked End includes an orchestra.  <br /> <br />people keep talking about how lead singer M. Shadows' voice has dramatically changed and they don't like it, blah, blah, blah. if they new the story behind the new sound they wouldn't be so damn prissy about it. shadows being professionally trained with his vocals wasn't enough, a vessel in this throat was damaged and surgery was a must. as a result of the surgery, a change was to be made to his vocal controls and what not, he's been training with Guns 'n' Roses trainer...and i must say that for someone who has been through all that his voice sounds god damn amazing!! <br /> <br /> <br />This album show how much they have grown musically and a must every A7X fan. <br />
0684824906|5.0|It is always a treat to read a new perspective on America's greatest and favorite president. Especially one as thorough and well-researched as this.  <br /> <br />Doris Kearns Goodwin takes an angle on Abraham Lincoln that others have touched on, but no one has explored so fully. Her presentation and description of Lincoln's mastery of the powerful men in his cabinet is illuminating, and sheds a new light on Lincoln's character. But it also highlights a peculiar phenomenon of history: the fact that whenever some great event is about to come to fruition, great men and women appear on the stage of life to play their parts in the drama. All of the men depicted in Goodwin's book, though rivals of Lincoln and of each other, to some degree ended up becoming colleagues and Lincoln's helpers.  <br /> <br />As others have said, the times produce \\"the man of the hour,\\" the individual equal to the task. But no great soul can go it alone, as Goodwin's book makes clear. A fascinating read, well worth the cost of admission.
B000E5N62U|5.0|BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU LIKE GOOD MUSIC. it is the best  album to date.  Its more concise and cohesive with his writing and soloing. The producing/mixing of the album is much more professional and creative than the previous albums. The album most importantly flows from beginning to end. Each track feeds into the next like it is all one giant song. It's reminiscent of Tim Kirkers album \\"LIKE DISTANT SOUNDS\\" clean, sophisticated and an absolute classic...BUY IT!
B00028HBKM|5.0|A child conceived by otherworldly forces, mothered by a kindly woman. A figure of peace and justice, betrayed by someone close to him and taken by the forces of evil. A man struck down, only to rise again and carry out his mission to bring balance to the world. <br /> <br />This is the story of Darth Vader. <br /> <br />Amazingly, it also describes the story of \\"the Passion of the Christ,\\" a film by Mel Gibson. You might think Gibson should stick to making movies about burned-out, widower cops (with or without post-apocalyptic wasteland settings), but brother, you'd be wrong. He proved with \\"Braveheart\\" that he's adept at directing movies about rebellious, inspirational martyrs...and this time he graciously decided to let somebody ELSE play the starring role! <br /> <br />Now, when this flick came out a couple of years ago, it was surrounded by controversy -- and not just because the title contains the word \\"the\\" more times than any movie except \\"the Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King.\\" For one thing, a lot of people thought the movie was anti-Semitic, because a lot of the bad guys were Jewish. Of course, a couple of the GOOD guys were Jewish, too -- not to mention the fact that many of the bad guys were Romans, not Jews. In truth, the movie is more anti-moron than anything. Just look at the portrayal of the d-bags who cackle and hoot while whipping Jesus with that freaky, scaled cat o' nine-tails; they were practically wearing dunce-caps. <br /> <br />People also criticized the graphic violence in the movie. Frankly, I found the gore to be somewhat tamer than I was expecting, but I've sat through Troma flicks without blinking an eye. The scourging and crucifixion of Jesus is pretty brutal, but it's counter-balanced by Jim \\"Angel Eyes\\" Caviezel's excellent moaning. That makes you feel pretty bad for Jesus. Apparently, a bunch of people cried in the theater at these scenes, but I haven't shed tears at a movie since I saw the last five minutes of \\"Jason X.\\" I will admit: I did find myself exclaiming \\"Jesus!\\" at a couple of points, which is actually pretty appropriate. <br /> <br />While all this scourging is going on, a sinister figure constantly lurks in the background. He looks sort of like the dude in \\"Powder,\\" and in one scene even carries around a little \\"Mini-Me\\" who snarls at the camera. The film never makes it perfectly clear that this is supposed to be Satan, but the guy's lack of eyebrows makes you pretty sure that it's SOME inhuman force of evil (other than Whoopi Goldberg). <br /> <br />Now, forgive me if I spoil the end of the movie, but Jesus is resurrected, and the final shot is him triumphantly standing up to leave his tomb and go kick some serious @ss. Jesus even has holes in his hands from the crucifix, which will cut down wind-resistance when he pimp-slaps evil. It's pretty cool -- I'm hoping Gibson decides to make a sequel, like \\"The Passion 2: Operation Stranglehold\\" or something. <br /> <br />In truth, the most impressive thing about \\"the Passion of the Christ\\" was the marketing. Seriously, only Jesus himself has had a better Public Relations campaign. I mean, it's an okay flick, but they really made it seem like The Most Important Film of All Time. Which, of course, we all know is a pedestal reserved for Michael Bay's upcoming \\"Transformers\\" movie. <br />
B0000AK7AA|5.0|i loved this movie... it was/ is sooooo funny and adorable. as a ghost, casper is cute and cuddly... but in the flesh he is soooooo hotttt!!! i am 14 so any guy with perfect blond hair and is my age (when filming(17)) then what girl cant give in!!! I really like fatsoe too!!! <br />All around fun and humor!!!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This \\"adaptation\\" was utterly and completely useless.  <br /> <br />There was no innvation in it at all! How can you call it an adaptation when it did nothing new and moreover left out all the wit and satire that made both the book and the BBC film version wonderful? <br /> <br />I could go on and on with the \\"fast forwarding\\" and the plot liberties and painting Elizabeth as a weak, love-struck little girl, but others have done so already. I'll just stick to the horrible casting: <br /> <br />Keira Knightly is gorgeous. But her face and body are modern. And she is so thin in this movie that dear Lizzie looks like a POW.  <br /> <br />Darcy has absolutely no presence. He is a wet rag and has none of those magnetic qualities that he should have so as to make him attractive despite his pride and conceit.  <br /> <br />Bingley reminds me vaguely of Clay Aiken (and not in a good way) and his sister is like the Paris Hilton of Pemberly (also, not in a good way).  <br /> <br />Kitty, Lydia, and Mary have no personality, neither does Jane.  <br /> <br />Wickham, is, at least nice to look at, but too pretty to be as believably cunning and womanizing as his character should be.  <br /> <br />I understand why this movie was made - cheap romantic consumption, riding on the coat tails of better Austen adaptations etc. But please, for christ's sake, how did this get any academy award nominations? There was nothing in it! No spirit, no art at all - just copying.  <br /> <br />I'm really appalled. I hope the next generation of austen fans doesn't group this together with the wonderful adaptations that have already been made. Sense and Sensibility, Emma, et al. are in a class by themselves.  <br /> <br />Now. Ang Lee, please can you do a GOOD version of Mansfield Park or Persuasion? That is what we need.
B000001EYW|5.0|We love the Bee Gee's and have their \\"one night only\\" concert on DVD and will probably need another one because I know we'll wear this one out.  Also, thanks for having a CD that is not in stores to buy. God Bless
006056251X|5.0|Ms. Kleypas continues her \\"Wallflower Series\\" with her third effort \\"Devil in Winter.\\"  This was a romantic romp from start to finish and I am eagerly waiting for the final book is this entertaining series.<br /><br />Evangeline Jenner is the ultimate wallflower.

This one read you will want to add to your \\"must read\\" stack.
B00003CX9S|4.0|I recently saw The Elephant Man on a movie channel. I've seen it before but it had been a long time. This is a truly touching film. John Hurt gives a outstanding performance as John Merrick, the poor disfigured and deformed man whom they called the elephant man. Anthony Hopkins gives us a great performance in this movie also. With great makeup effects and a great cast and touching story, this film will always remain a film that I think no one can forget. It is truly sad, especially because this is a true story. Your  heart goes out to Merrick for having to live the life he was given. He truly had a kind heart but was constantly taunted and picked at and even used as a freak at a side show. Yet he was a very smart man. This film shows how cruel some people can be to someone who is \\"different\\". What they failed to do is see the true man behind the deformities. \\"  I am not an animal, I'm a man\\". Well said Merrick. Unfortunately Merrick died in his late twenties. His one dream was to be able to lay down in bed and sleep  like a \\"normal\\" person. Something we all take forgranted sometimes. Merrick had to sleep sitting up b/c of his condition. It is said that he knew when laying down in a normal position that he would die from suffication but he did so anyway. Suffication was the cause of death for Merrick.... from lying down on his back. Maybe Merrick decided  he had enough of the cruel world he was seeing. Regardless, at least he died doing something he wanted to do most..... be normal. Great, touching movie. I recommend anyone see this film and realize that no matter what we look like on the outside, we are all human.
0060920084|5.0|I'm a Bryson fan anyway, but I'd have to say this is in a class with \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" and \\"In A Sunburned Country.\\"  Bryson, who at the time he wrote this book (late eighties) was living in England, drives his mother's Chevette through thirty-eight states.  Loosely, he's in search of the perfect American town; more to the point, it's a great opportunity to see America through Bill Bryson's eyes.   <br /> <br />We read of his attitudes towards the south; his experiences as a child on family vacations; the difference between attitudes in the Midwest and everywhere else; and his encounter with someone who really wants to know whether they can smoke on a Grayhound bus.  <br /> <br />His commentary is always witty and occasionally acerbic.  Bryson appears to have written the book for an English audience (or at least have been influenced by living in England for so long), and occasional lapses into English English (as opposed to American English) may distract occasionally.  Overall, though, the book is well-written and provides a laugh and a half a page.
B000AWYOGE|1.0|I bought this movie on the release date because I really wanted to watch it and the video store was obviously closed. Off I went to sear's with my money. Worst mistake i'll ever make. It started out strong but by the middle you were slipping into a comatose state. Borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I never got the chance to see the musical live, but I've read the book and from what I've heard, the musical's storyline goes a bit astray. This gives reason for the musical not to be as good or have as much depth as the book, but I've heard the songs and they themselves are reason enough to go see the show. <br />Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth have amazing voices and the music suits them perfectly. They harmonize well and the lyrics are really clever, too. Stephen Schwartz did a great job composing the songs, even if not all of them are show stoppers, and I have to ask all the people who gave one star, did you listen to Defying Gravity? It's musical guiniess and I have no idea how you can't admit that. <br />For people who scoffed all the unrealistic ideas in the show, it's set in a different world, what do you expect? And it is explained in the story how Elphaba becomes wicked: it's a series of events, not just one, and the fact that she keeps being pushed down and denied what she most wants, which changes during the story. In the end it's just to be left alone to burn the grimmerie and the slippers and bury herself, but when Dorothy asks her forgiveness, that's the last straw, because Elphaba never got forgiveness for killing Fiyero. <br />Overall, it's an excellent CD and you should get it.
0307276902|1.0|I was impressed with James Frey on OPhra and very dissapointed in his book.  The language was offensive to me and it distracted me from reading the book.  People have commented as to how the book has helped them with their addictions and I was interested in sharing this with people that have those problems.  But just could not get through the first chapter because of the offensive language.  I am also dissappointed in Ophra for referring this book.  As a Christian I have a problem with the book.
1892005034|4.0|This book doesn't have a lot of concepts, but the framework that it presents for difficult communication situations is very useful.  The author also uses a lot of examples to illustrate how the model is used.<br /><br />Personally, I found there were too many examples in the book for my taste and I got tired of reading them.  However, I know some people really relate to this approach and it does drive the model into memory.<br /><br />In terms of material, I think there are lots of other good books on the subject out there that pack more material into the same space.  However, for people who want an easy model, quick and enjoyable read and some concepts they can apply right away, then this might be just right.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|I just caught this film on DVD after hearing much hype over the last couple of years and I wasn't let down. The acting was very good and the twist was unique (though I did predict it before it was revealed). This film may be a disturbing to some, even though it leaves more up to the imagination in terms of actually showing the gore. If you are in the mood for an original movie that will likely leave you a little depressed, then give Oldboy a try. When the film ends, you can at least be optimistic about how your life isn't half as bad as it could be. Just look at the dude in Oldboy for a reference.
B00063MBU8|3.0|When Simple Plan burst onto the scene with \\"I'd Do Anything\\" and \\"Addicted\\", I basically wrote them off as just another run-of-the-mill punk-pop band. Now, that's not to say that they fell off; No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls went multi-platinum. Their latest album, Still Not Getting Any, had no problem getting platinum certification either, but I don't know; it just doesn't do anything for me.<br /><br />I'm not saying there's NOTHING good about this album; \\"Welcome to My Life\\" was an excellent choice for the lead single. But after that came \\"Shut Up\\", where the chorus \\"Shut up, shut up, shut up/Don't wanna hear it\\" took the words right out of my mouth. The song is about a foe getting in their way, and actually, every single song on here is about friends or girlfriends doing them wrong. And the songwriting isn't too stellar, either (\\"Thank You\\", anyone?).<br /><br />Another thing is that when they to get deep like they did on \\"Perfect\\", they hit (\\"Untitled\\") and miss (\\"Crazy\\"). The latter is a what's-wrong-with-the-world song, and I think it's odd that they lament: \\"Rich guys driving big SUV's/While kids are starving in the streets\\". Excuse me, but what do THEY drive? Station wagons? I don't think \\"Jump\\" is necessarily trying to rip off Van Halen's hit of the same name, but it still gives you that feeling (albeit unsuccessful). Finally, \\"One\\" makes absolutely no sense.<br /><br />If you liked No Pads, then you'll probably like this album too, but if you WEREN'T impressed by Simple Plan before now, then this album probably won't change your opinion about them. While a more than suitable album for punk-pop lovers, everyone else will probably say that SP are still not getting any more creative.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B00027JYLC|5.0|I first rented the DVD because of the \\"cult\\" status it holds. After watching it repeatedly over a single weekend, I had to own it. It's almost 75 years old now, so keep that in mind when watching it- how many of today's Oscar winner movies will be remembered in 75 years? All the more interesting was the hysteria that surrounded it, its banning from Europe for decades, and that it virtually ended the careers of those who produced it. <br /> <br />The story and some of acting are rather mundane, but the movie grips you and you can't turn away. You'll find yourself siding with the \\"Freaks\\" as they take on the abuse and prejudices that have changed very little in all this time. The actors with disabilities are so totally engrossing that you wonder why we are all so afraid of the \\"different.\\" Of special interest for me are Daisy and Harry Earles, also known as part the Doll Family. Born in Germany, they were siblings from a family of 7 children, of which four were Little People who formed the \\"Doll Family. Daisy was billed the \\"Midget May West\\" for her adorable screen persona and looks. Harry was one of the \\"Lollipop Guild\\" trio from the Wizard of Oz, and the other three Dolls were in it as well. <br /> <br />The movies has some rough edges, and yes, the accents are sometimes hard to understand. But the DVD has subtitles in English, which you can turn on briefly if you just can't make out a line. The Special Features section has some great background on the production that you should not miss. <br /> <br />Watch this masterpiece and you will never forget it or the magical people that made it what it is.
0790729628|1.0|I should have come here first to see some of the reviews of the Directors Cut. I never would have bought my copy. Without the naration by \\"Deckard\\" it is completly useless AFAIC. The voice over gave insight into what was happening that is not revealed by just watching the movie. And now in the movie where Deckard used to be narating, it's just silence. What's the point. I only watched about 10 minutes of the Director's Cut version and then I shut it off.<br /><br />Blade Runner used to be one of my favorite movies. I would have put it as a 5 Star rating in the original version. I will never watch it as the Directors Cut. I hope to be able to find an original copy.<br /><br />I hope Ridley Scott doesn't ruin Alien or Aliens like he did Blade Runner.

B000089CJI|5.0|The only real criticism I can make of this album is that it's too short.<br /><br />Give Up is an almost uniformly perfect record, atmospheric, cleverly written and flat-out gorgeous. \\"Such Great Heights\\" is certainly the album's peak, but \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight,\\" \\"Sleeping In,\\" \\"Nothing Better,\\" \\"Recycled Air,\\" \\"Clark Gable,\\" \\"This Place is a Prison\\" and \\"Brand New Colony\\" make sure it's not alone.<br /><br />In an era when it's a treat to find an album with even three good songs on a CD that justify its purpose, it's a thrill to have back to back to back great songs.<br /><br />The strongest possible recommendation for this album. Get it, now.
006056251X|3.0|Considering Lisa Kleypas' stellar track record, \\"Devil in Winter\\" isn't her best book.  Oh, I suppose it was pretty good, and I did stay up all night to finish it.  But \\"Devil in Winter\\" is going to be quickly forgotten in my mind.  Sebastian St. Vincent is supposed to be a rake.  I'd like to know where is the rake in this story?  Sebastian is more of a mush-ball than a devil.  He falls in love with Evie a little too quickly for a rake.  \\"Devil in Winter\\" also lacks sexual tension.  Evie gives it all up to Sebastian too quickly although Kleypas can be commended for her super steamy love scenes.  Notwithstanding the above gripes, I would have liked to read more about Evie's horrible family.  They supposedly had a great affect on Evie, causing her to stutter.  I would think that if one is locked away from society, there would be more emotional baggage.  It would have been interesting to see Sebastian develop as a person through helping Evie overcome her abusive past.  Overall, \\"Devil in Winter\\" is a good book, but not a keeper.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Death Cab for Cutie are in danger of being overhyped and, thus, overlooked. Can anyone really take a band seriously that is hyped by characters on the OC? In this case, well, yeah. Plans by Death Cab for Cutie is one of the highlights of 2005 and the new century of music.<br /><br />\\"Soul Meets Body,\\" \\"Crooked Teeth\\" and especially the wonderful and strange \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" more than justify the purchase of this album, as they are ably backed by songs that, on any other album, would be the standouts. (\\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark,\\" in particular, is a great example of a song that shouldn't work by any sane standard, but does, and amazingly so.)<br /><br />Amidst the gems, though, there are, if not clunkers, less-impressive tunes. \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed,\\" in particular, feels like it would have been quite comfortable laying on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />In the end, Plans is less even than Give Up by the Postal Service (a related project), but is still one of the best albums of 2005 by any measure.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.
B0000AUHPG|2.0|This is a story of macho baloney and pithy dialogue that reeks.  It is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time, right up there with the Bollywood version of The Godfather.<br /><br />There are three supermen in the movie, three guys who shoot straight and talk sparingly.  Charles Bronson plays super hero of super heroes, da good guy who shoots da fastest.  Dang he cool.  Henry Fonda embarrasses himself as da bad guy, showing that even the brilliant actor who played in the excellent movie On Golden Pond could easily sink to playing a tin devil in this trash.  Jason Robards plays Cheyenne, so he cool too, an he shoot purty good too, though he am be second fiddle to the other two macho jerks.<br /><br />The writing is pathetic.  The characters leave a lot unsaid, but that is because they are so cool.  Dey nebber lose dey cool.<br /><br />Even the one female in the movie, Claudia Cardinale, talks like they do.  She doesn't talk much, and needer do dey.  Oh if we could all be so macho, so wise, and shoot so darn good.<br /><br />It really dont matter how far away the target is, or if the target is on a moving horse.  We will done shoot him and kill him with one shot.  We iz dat good.  We iz dat cool.<br /><br />This movie is awful, and there is something seriously wrong with anyone who thinks it is great.  Yee hah, from de days when a man wuz a man and a woman kep her mouth shut and let de boys smack her butt cause dey deserve it.<br /><br />The only way to salvage such a stupid movie would have been for Jason Robards, at the end, to turn to Charles Bronson and say please make love to me like you used to.
B000AP04NI|1.0|Old movies are great.  I've been waiting for the release of Oklahoma! in the new technology DVD format - I wanted to use my new DVD up-converter.

Fox should have a press release when they fix the problems reviewed here - until I know it's AT LEAST as good as my outdated Laser Disk, I'll wait.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I discovered Idina Menzel through RENT and I have Kristin Chenoweth's two cds but I just recently invested in the Wicked recording. I absolutely adore it and I've listened to it every day since I recieved it from Amazon a week ago. Both Kristin and Idina's voices are flawless on this recording. I do believe that Idina has that the better songs, though. \\"Defying Gravity\\" and \\"No good deed\\" are my two ultimate favorite songs off of the cd. \\"Popular\\" showcases Kristin's comic timing, I hear it and I can't help but smile. I've never seen \\"Wicked\\" on stage but now I can't wait to have an oppurtunity to see the show.
0393327655|1.0|I'll start by saying I agree with Harris that religious belief is fundamentally irrational.  I agree that such irrationalism (along with a blatant disregard of human finitude) certainly accounts for how \\"good\\" men conclude they must do terrible things to their fellow human beings.  And exactly how a given scripture can both be the word of Allah/Buddha/God and be discounted by its followers in contemporary practice is always an amusing dance by the faithful.    Sam Harris trots these themes out like a college sophomore who thinks he's discovered something no one else has ever seen before.  Unfortunately for my opinion of him, I first saw these themes in my own sophomore year in college - in American, British and French writers from the 18th century!  He then uses the term paper motif to try to disguise what is essentially a rant.         Bottom line: How sad such provocative and timely themes should be so poorly served.    Not that he isn't fun to read.  He's no P. J. O'Rourke, but he is definitely of the sex-drugs-rocknroll school of entertaining sarcasm.  His prose is so young and so earnest and so impassioned - nothing at all like the careful and measured and balanced and dull scholarly works that are as enthusiastically embraced as public television by today's culture.  He's young; he's pissed off; he sounds smart; he's got a mouth on him. He's a star.    He's also a secular fundamentalist with the same low tolerance for deviation from his take on \\"reason\\" that the Taliban (or the church of the Inquisition or the Yahweh of Jericho or the ancient Buddha of Lanka) have for deviation from their take on their religions.  Sigh: A common inconsistency among the young and the righteous.      There are several ideas worthy of thought and discussion in this book.  It's a real shame he ended up on a soapbox instead.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|Who would think that this sort of agitprop would be engaging? Don't they think there are movie-goers who deserve something more interesting than consipracy theories or middle-adged men surrounded by real suffering wondering whether his dead wife \\"truly\\" loved him?<br /><br />Once you graduate high school, the black and white vision of corporations = evil, emotional, well-meaning NGO workers = good lacks all appeal.

B000EWBKM6|2.0|Hard to believe that the Finale is being offered when the entire series has not yet been released.

0743454529|1.0|To the readers who've commented on the errors in her depiction of epilepsy, add also: 1. You can't tip cows (as Jesse claims to have done).  2.

B00005JOE8|3.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" is not revolutionary, politically insightful or particularly original, despite the praise it's gotten. <br /> <br />The film shows us a society of violent arrests, a big brotheresque government leader who addresses his henchmen over a giant video screen, and shadowy agents conducting surveillance. We're told the people willfully consented to a government that curbs their civil rights. We see troops in vaguely Nazi-looking uniforms parading before an all-powerful \\"Chancellor\\" and a media that's entirely government-controlled. And the director goes to great lengths to show us the horrors of British dentistry, especially when it comes to the bad guys.  <br /> <br />The fascit-like state is certainly not new ground for movies, so the twist is V himself -- a terrorist who fights the oppressive system and inspires people to rise up.  <br /> <br />But aside from a vague flashback in montage form and a few bits of dialogue, we're never told why or how the U.K. became a police state and how people became so frightened they allowed it to happen. This gap in the backstory becomes more obvious when V and the government each broadcast their own alternating propaganda to the British people -- we see a rotating series of shots that involve two or three families in their living rooms, a room full of elderly people in a nursing home, and some football fans in a pub, all watching the propaganda. The film cuts to the same people in the same shots over and over again as various pieces of propaganda are broadcast from opposing sides. The movie wants us to believe it's the future and these people are oppressed, but it looks like present-day England and the people seem to be having a good time -- those scenes could pass for commercials for Ikea or Miller Lite. <br /> <br />V's own backstory seems like a bad rip-off of a Wolverine-style scientific experiment gone wrong, right on down to the unintentional side effect of a genetic mutation leading, conveniently, to really awesome superhuman fighting skills. And while the story goes to great lengths to show V as a feared -- but good -- terrorist, it glosses over the thorny issue of how a guy can run around detonating buildings without killing people. It's like the director and writers thought that would be too much moral ambiguity for audiences to chew on. There's also a fleeting reference to \\"America's war\\" over a visual of what looks like Iraq, and through a series of events the director doesn't explain, the mainland of the U.S. is reduced to smoldering ruins.  <br /> <br />While the parallels to today's world problems are facile, the acting is strong and the action plays out in a satisfying way. This film is proof that Natalie Portman can be not only credible in a sci-fi flick, but genuinely convincing -- and that the blame for her wooden performances in Star Wars should squarely rest on the shoulders of George Lucas and his ridiculous dialogue. As for Hugo Weaving, it's hard to imagine many other actors would be capable of bringing so much personality to a character who wears a mask for the entire movie. His performance was reminiscent of Edward Norton's masked king in \\"Kingdom of Heaven,\\" except Alan Moore's story gives Weaving more to work with, and Weaving handles it perfectly. <br /> <br />Overall, this film is a lot of fun as a sci-fi effort, but it is not the intelligent or profound commentary on society that some people mistake it for.
044022425X|5.0|Gabaldon, again, weaves a wonderful story of adventure for Jamie and Claire.  Those two names evoke a feeling of such excitement.  I was happy to see them settle into domestic bliss, after seveal novels of constant turmoil, peppered with calm interludes. Gabaldon is so true to Jamie and Claire, I am rarely surprised by what they do.  It's a cozy familiarity.  Her ability to drag up past characters creates an intimate world of criss crossed lives and intermingled plot lines. I love that Claire always finds her medical niche, with her infamous box of herbs. And Jamie has his kilt back! I'm not sure why, but the descriptions of the kilts in the earlier books was just fscinating. I loved hearing all of the uses for the wool. Symbolicly, to me it also means that everything is right in the world - Jamie in a kilt. SPOILER - I was thrilled that Jamie finally got to meet Bree.  I know this is fiction, but I was stupidly happy over it.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story line with Bree and Roger.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Though Walt Disney Pictures has made many animated features, the vast majority are based on stories common in western cultures.  \\"Mulan\\" breaks new ground as an animated feature from a Chinese fable.  Mulan is a young girl who has taken her father's place in the military to fight invaders.  As with many countries, women were expected to remain at home and allow men to handle the fighting.  As this movie makes very clear, death was an expected punishment for a female impersonating a male warrior.  However, Mulan overcomes stereotypes and helps defend her country, and charms us along the way.<br /><br />This movie has an incredible cast.  Miguel Ferrer voices Shan-Yu, the leader of the invading Huns.  Miguel adds a sinister edge to his deep voice that enhances our dislike for the ruthless character of Shan-Yu.  Beautiful Ming-Na provides the voice of Mulan.  Ming-Na won an Annie Award for her voice portrayal of Mulan.  Eddie Murphy is perfect and funny as the dragon Mushu whose heart is bigger than his body or his brains.  The late Pat Morita is excellent as the voice of the Emperor of China.  Numerous other voice talents bring this movie to life.  Korean actor Oh Soon Tek voice Fa Zhou.  Veteran actor Miriam Margolyes voices the Matchmaker.  Matthew Laborteaux, Gedde Watanabe, James Hong, and numerous other stars make their appearances in this film.<br /><br />As with many Disney films, this movie includes several excellent songs.  Singing those songs are well known artists Christina Aguilera, Stevie Wonder, 98 Degrees, Donny Osmond and Lea Salonga.<br /><br />This movie captured more than the hearts and minds of viewers.  This movie also captured 14 awards and 13 award nominations, including a nomination for an Oscar.  This movie also has one of the highest box office totals of all time, ranking in the top 200 as of the date of this review.<br /><br />Walt Disney Pictures has had some mis-steps in movie productions as it seeks to regain the prominence in family films that it once had.  This movie placed Disney Pictures back in the spotlight as one of the premiere studios for making family films.  I believe that most families will enjoy this tale based on a Chinese fable.  Along the way perhaps members of the family will learn something about heroism and selflessness, and that girls and women have far greater capability than many, including themselves, give them credit.  This DVD is a necessity for any family's home film library.  Enjoy!ily films that it once had.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|A well done adaptation of Austen's novel. While I probably prefer the earlier BBC version, this production has wit and charm. Keira Knightley was wonderful. I offers an interesting view of the Bennett's economic status and life style. Great use of nature in the film.<br /><br />I'm still wondering why Donald Sutherland was cast. He was fine, but were all the terrific English actors his age engaged? do they think Americans won't see a film unless it features and American?
B000008M1P|3.0|In 1988, during the height of the 80's hairmetal trend, along came the all woman band \\"Vixen.\\" There weren't a lot of female hairbands, so Vixen is really the only one that comes to mind. This, their debut album houses their best known song \\"Edge of a Broken Heart.\\" Probably their best song! The album as a whole is listenable, but nothing is as strong as the single Edge of a Broken Heart, and the song Crying. If you enjoy this type of music give Vixen a try.
B00005QFE5|5.0|I'm not a foreign film buff, by any stretch - but I loved this movie!  In fact, my 14-year-old daughter loved it too, subtitles and all.  It's charming, with moments of subtle humor, and is ultimately a testament to the power of a great love.  We originally checked it out from the library, but decided that we wanted to own it because it's the kind of film you want to see more than once.  Don't miss this one.
0307276902|2.0|Ya this book is amusing, or should I say interesting, But honestly I didn`t believe have the stuff in it, just impossible, I have seen the worst of the worst in addictions, and this just didn`t sum up. <br />If you want to read a book that is right on with addictions, read Lifes Trial written by Gina Henderson, its about a little girl that had to grow up with a parent on heroin, Its really Shocking, and believable.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I've lost count of how many films have been made of Jane Austen's best-loved book, but this latest release is far from the worst. That dubious honor in my view goes to the 1942 movie that had the characters parading around in what looked like wardrobe rejects from \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and Greer Garson at age 36 trying to convincingly play a 20 year old ingenue. Give me a break.<br /><br />The latest film, directed by Joe Wright, is a fairly faithful retelling of Austen's plot, which almost everybody and his mother is familiar with by now, with gorgeous visuals to hook us squarely into the time and place. The visuals, in fact, are so beautiful to look at that at times they tend to overwhelm the story.<br /><br />For anyone out there -- if there is anyone out there -- who doesn't know the plot, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" introduces us to the Bennet family who belong to the upper-middle-class landed gentry in late 18th century England. The second daughter, Elizabeth, sharp as a marble and pretty to boot, meets Mr. Darcy, a tall, dark, handsome and single young man with money out the wazoo. It's loathing at first sight. He despises her middle-class connections; she thinks he's a stuck-up snob with an attitude. The rest of the story has them finding out how wrong they are about each other; there are a lot of interesting plot twists and turns, but in the end, of course, almost everybody ends up living happily ever after.<br /><br />Jane Austen told her sister Cassandra that she thought the book was \\"rather too light and bright and sparkling\\" but that is exactly what has endeared it to generations of readers in print and on film. Who doesn't love a good love story? But there is a problem with this version; perhaps, in trying to tell the whole story in two hours, it's told too much and not enough both at once. The second and third versions of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", on BBC in 1980 and A&E in 1995, were serialized over four to five hours and told the story pretty much as Austen wrote it, especially the BBC version, my personal favorite. Joe Wright's film tries to tell the whole story also but there's too much story for two hours to do it justice. As a result, the film feels compressed in spots. It feels truncated. We don't see nearly enough of Elizabeth's Aunt and Uncle Gardiner, two characters who are central to the book; Bingley's married sister and her husband are left out altogether, and the whole movie has a kind of rushed quality. You won't notice it if you haven't read the book and/or seen the BBC or A&E movies, but you'll notice it a lot if you have.<br /><br />Joe Wright also took some positively unsettling liberties with the Bennets. In Austen's book they are an upper-middle-class family who are the \\"principal inhabitants\\" of the neighborhood. In Wright's film, they look like they've gone to seed. The cows are mooing in the back yard, the pigs are ambling into the premises through the back door, a harried-looking Mrs. Bennet and her daughters are toiling in the kitchen (although in the book Mrs. Bennet indignantly tells the Reverend Mr. Collins that her daughters have nothing to do in the kitchen as the family is perfectly well able to afford a good cook), and a bleary-eyed Mr. Bennet sits in his library looking unwashed, uncombed and unkempt. The whole establishment looks drab and dingy, in need of a good paint job. In the earlier movies Longbourn looks like a fairly prosperous estate; this movie conjures up images of Tobacco Road.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is a delight to watch as Elizabeth Bennet; she's smart, sassy and easy on the eyes. She's as good as Elizabeth Garvie was in the role in the BBC version and she's an improvement over Jennifer Ehle. Belinda Blethlyn is funny and ditzy as Mrs. Bennet, an insufferable airhead whose one goal in life is to marry off her brood. Dame Judi Dench is suitably Gorgon-like as Lady Catherine DeBourgh; it's a shame we don't see enough of her in the film either.<br /><br />The big problem for this reviewer was Matthew McFayden's interpretation of Darcy. For a lot of people who saw the other films, the gold standard for Darcy was Colin Firth, although not for this reviewer; I thought Firth was miscast as Darcy (ducking brickbats from Firth groupies as I type this). Firth was trying to be a very 90's Darcy, sensitive and vulnerable; but his Darcy wasn't Austen's Darcy by a long shot. McFayden plays Darcy as if he were racked with inner torment over his wealth and status; he comes off almost as insecure. If there is one thing Austen's Darcy isn't, it's insecure; he's almost too full of himself to be real until Elizabeth knocks him down a few pegs. McFayden was trying to bring out Darcy's soft side -- he has one, underneath all that starched armor -- but in doing so he underplays Darcy's haughty exterior to the point that we wonder what Elizabeth found so revolting about him in the first place. Something doesn't add up.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, the movie delivers in the time it has to do it in. There is no way to faithfully put \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" on film in only two hours. But the essence of the story is there. It's lovely to watch and nice to listen to. Wright does a creditable job of bring Austen's best-loved book to the screen. I just wish he'd made it into a longer film.<br /><br />Judy LindThe big problem for this reviewer was Matthew McFayden's interpretation of Darcy.

B00004R9A4|4.0|This movie is one of those family charmers that has something for everyone.  There is an exciting animated portion for the children.  There is a love story for the ladies.  And there is a battle with World War II Germans for guys of all ages.  Tying all these different aspects together is a wonderful concept; Angela Lansbury is a mail-order witch!<br /><br />During World War II, parents sent their children from London to the country because London was being bombed continuously.  Three children, Carrie, Paul and Charlie Rawlins (performed by Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill, respectively), are placed with Eglantine Price (Lansbury).  We quickly learn that Miss Price is completely uninterested in caring for any children as they may upset her mysterious plans.  The children, and we, soon learn that Miss Price is a witch in training, training received by mail!<br /><br />Because Miss Price is actually a very nice, if somewhat eccentric, lady, she works a compromise with the children, allowing them to live with her in her large home.  We also quickly learn that the mail order school is closing, and Miss Price was looking for an important lesson.  The children and Miss Price are off to find the headmaster of the school, Mr. Emelius Browne (played by David Tomlinson, who also performed in \\"Tom Jones,\\" \\"Mary Poppins,\\" and \\"The Love Bug\\").  Their mode of travel is a bed that Miss Price has modified using a spell.<br /><br />Mr. Browne is astounded that his spells actually worked.  However, Mr. Browne is also sorry but he is unable to provide the important spell that Miss Price is seeking; a spell that could save England from Hitler!  Soon the children, Miss Price and a disbelieving Mr. Browne are off to Portobello Road to find the book containing the spell, instead running into the Bookman (played by Sam Jaffe, who was Gunga Din in the 1939 movie \\"Gunga Din,\\" and was in other great movies such as \\"Ben-Hur\\" and \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\").  After escaping the Bookman, the children and adults head off to a mystical island and encounter a group of animated talking critters.  Returning from the island, the three children and two adults are prepared to rest from searching for the important spell when they discover a German submarine has landed soldiers that are planning to create mischief in the English countryside.  The ending of this movie is a charmer that will intrigue even the most jaded of movie fans, and provide laughs for everyone.<br /><br />This movie is pure escapist fantasy that begins with a very real life event, much like other similar stories such as \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\"  I think Angela Lansbury makes this movie believable.  She slips into her role very comfortably, making you believe that she is a somewhat bumbling witch who barely controls her own spells.  She is admittedly a novice at being a witch, but a very believable novice.  This movie centers on her and her acting ability.  Once you accept Miss Price is an apprentice witch, a traveling bed, which is accompanied by dated special effects), animated talking animals, and armor moving by itself are easy to accept.  Even easier to accept are the laughs that go along with the story.<br /><br />This movie is from the era when Disney Studios had a fool-proof formula for delivering good family movies.  This family movie is one of the best, and will be a treasure in every family's movie library.ing the Bookman, the children and adults head off to a mystical island and encounter a group of animated talking critters.

020161622X|3.0|I like this book for the most part.  I find it falls short in describing a good (appropriate) use of Architecture Specifications, Design Plans, etc.  This is especially true for those who are self-taught or went to school years ago and may not have been exposed to this kind of development process.  While the author's approach may be great for some, experience has shown me that whether I'm working in a large team environment or by myself, having good requirements, architecture specifications, and development plans do a lot to kill programming bugs before they occur, and more importantly, serve as a compass for the code-writing portion of the development process, no matter what the size of the coding team.  I think readers will probably benefit more by reading \\"Code Complete\\" 2nd Ed. (2004) by Steve McConnell.
006441034X|5.0|The book was most definately excellent, but everything is slumped into the end...was annoying but other than that excellent book...
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend is one of those rare artists that just crop up when you least expect. His album is marvelous. My peronal favourite is So High.. In fact, all the tracks are great because you get to discover a beautiful song each time you listen to the album. Its a must have!!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Panic! at the Disco's new album, \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out,\\" is easily in the top three albums of the year for me. Panic! has crazy lyrics complemented by the background music which is in a class by its own. I can't wait till their next album.
B000065PUE|5.0|...is probably what this review will be. Yeah, everything you heard about the Pixies is pretty much true. The influence they've had is really undeniable, and personally, I feel that \\"Doolittle\\" just might be my very favorite Pixies album. I liked the first two albums a lot as well, but this one is the one where I can truly enjoy each track (maybe \\"blasphemous\\" for some, but I never liked \\"Broken Face\\"). True, it may not be the deepest lyrically but it does not suck in that department either. I don't like it when bands try to fake being profound in the first place, so this is nice. In fact I really love the lyrics about driving the car into the ocean on \\"Wave of Mutilation\\", which had a different version previously released as a B-side. Also, \\"Monkey\\" isn't a total obvious song but definitely has a message in it, and it's filled with the quirkiness you'll know and love in the Pixies. Also, the variety is just nice. Each track flows nicely together, and while it's a little bit different, my favorite is definitely western-like \\"Silver\\", with its eerie performance. Who says that drummers can't sing well? Well, Dave Lovering does just that on \\"La La Love You\\", although the lyrics are very simple, but due to that it's got a really great drum intro which follows the surf-style riff and the pop melody, it makes for a classic. It's kind of like \\"Here Comes Your Man\\", also on this record, with the catchy pop that is still never disposable.. And for people new to the band, this would be good to look into. There's also reggae rhythms in \\"Mr. Grieves\\", something that kind of makes it fun and a different pace. If you love Nirvana then you'll love \\"Gouge Away\\". The five-star average rating is more than justified. Start to beginning, \\"Doolittle\\" succeeds at being interesting, exciting, and pleasing for the ears, and what's even better, the record is timeless in sound. They were ahead of their time in the first place, so it's more amazing that this doesn't sound the least bit dated.
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|Never thought I'd see the day, but Disney flunked with this one.  Mr. Cohen's review says it looks like a bad muppet show and he is right.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't.  Incredibly clunky, bad sound, just plain bad.
B000002JOH|5.0|This is easily one of the heaviest albums ever made, but it's not so absorbed in its heaviness that the music is bad (*cough*CannibalCorpse*cough*), it is also very melodic and has great songs and solos from Dimebag. It has a lot of the most popular Pantera songs like \\"Mouth For War\\", \\"Walk\\", \\"F-ing Hostile\\", \\"This Love\\", and \\"Holow\\", all of which are great songs, but I personally think the best song is \\"No Good\\". This song has a great riff and is extreemly catchy. A must have for any metal fan.
B000E8NRR6|5.0|Donald Fagen has a completely unique sound - the center of Steely Dan he comes back with one of his lyrically best works.  \\"Morph The Cat\\". My best judge of a sucessful rhythm is when you can't get it out of your head.  The title track certainly does this for me.  I first heard a sample track on Napster whilst waiting for the special edition CD to arrive.  That track was the title track, I instantly knew I wouldn't be disappointed. <br /> <br />I listened to the album again one lunchtime over a sandwich but this time in 5.1  The jazz sound just washed over me in high resolution surround the only way to hear this album.  I am lucky enough to have a creative dvd audio player on my pc - so I can continue to listen in 5.1 whilst on the computer.  In fact I am listening to \\"What I do\\" now.  No its Brite Nightgown now - wow what a delicious intro. <br /> <br />I have noticed this artist takes his time to release albums and like Stevie Wonder the songs are infinitely superior as a result.   <br /> <br />Well done Donald you just get better. <br /> <br />Just to clear up the problem with certain DVD-A discs playing  silent on Pioneer 563A players, its firmware, I sent mine of to Pioneer and they upgraded it now it can play any DVD-A disc I throw at it.
B00005JOQ9|5.0|Fist off, <br />all you people that are sayin cabin fever was one of the worst horror films ever, it was a comedy. I read that somewhere before. <br /> <br />And secondly, stop taking a film so personal, if it was meant to judge the American and European cultures than it would probably be far more political and culturally aimed.  <br /> <br />This film is great, it's what the target audience (which I'm guessing is teenagers 16-18, yes I know the film is rated 18, but not by the filmmakers.) anyway, it's what the target audience likes to see these days, blood gore and human torture. Sad, but true. <br /> <br />You've just got to remember it's a film. <br /> <br />Chill out. <br /> <br />Sarah
B0000CDL93|5.0|Many of the reviews here argue the validity of the film as a  truthful representation of events.  Get over it, you guys.  Look at it as A MOVIE.<br /><br />I saw this in 1991 with my then 13 year old son.  I was born in 1952 and I remember where I was when I heard that Kennedy had been shot.  My son was born in 1978 and he remembers where he was when he heard that BUCKWHEAT had been shot!  But this movie had him rivetted to his seat.  It loses a lot on the small screen, but, hey, look at the cast.  It reads like a who's who of Hollywood at the time.<br /><br />No, people, if you want a serious DVD collection, you gotta have this one.
B000002JKA|5.0|Dream Theater is awesome, one of few bands keeping progressive, complex, heavy music alive right now. John Petrucci sounds amazing on his 7 string on this album, and Mike Portnoy's drumming is out of this world. This album has a particuarly heavy feel to it, which I know a lot of other Dream Theater fans didn't care for, but as a fan of extreem metal, works out great for me. There are still some softer songs on here though, and some of them are the best (\\"Innocence Faded\\", \\"Silent Man\\"). Definitly buy this.
B000059TEQ|4.0|Everyone knows the theme music to this one. From what I hear, the film was a huge hit when it came out in 1970. The \\"love story\\" involves two students from Harvard: The guy (Ryan O'Neal) is a likable hockey player from an incredibly rich family who doesn't get along with his rigidly high-class father (Ray Milland); the gal (Ali MacGraw) is an intelligent musician from a working-class family who strangely calls her father \\"Phil\\" and cusses a lot.<br /><br />When I first saw the film, over four years ago, I didn't much like Ali MacGraw's character. She comes off bizarre and annoying (\\"Hey preppy\\" -- \\"preppy\\" \\"preppy\\" \\"preppy\\"). O'Neal's character, on the other hand, I found to be an all-around likable guy -- tough but at the same time very nice, filthy rich yet undenialby humble and respectful.<br /><br />MacGraw's character kinda turned me off to the the flick the first time I saw it. Seeing it again recently, I enjoyed \\"Love Story\\" more because I was prepared to handle and embrace her strange personality.<br /><br />The father/son 'relationship' is very interesting: O'Neal calls Milland \\"sir\\" at all times. In reality there's NO relationship at all. Hence, what ultimately takes place in the story is both understandable and believable.<br /><br />There's a funny scene when O'Neal finally takes MacGraw to his family estate to meet his parents. She's understandably overwhelmed when she realizes just how rich O'Neal's family actually is. Her true-to-character reaction made me bust out laughing.<br /><br />I enjoyed the New England locations and seasonal changes. The setting and tone naturally reminded me of \\"Dead Poets Society.\\" I'm not saying \\"Love Story\\" is anywhere near as good because \\"Dead Poets Society\\" is in a class by itself. Yet, \\"Love Story\\" is a good drama/romance; I technically rate it 3.5/5 Stars. Just keep in mind that it's from 1970. Viewing it is like going back in time; in other words, it's a fascinating period-piece.y.\\" His major change in the storyline, of course, is that he wants both of the lovers to be male (LOL!!).
0440236738|5.0|'Gone for Good' is by far the best I've read from Harlan Coben.  Coben always produces well-written mysteries but are always ruined in some way due to his irresistable urge to throw in preposterous plot twists at the very end.  'Gone for Good' fits the pattern however thankfully all the plot twists really work well, and are surprisingly plausible. <br /> <br />So what is the book about?  It's a rather complicated story of a young man unraveling the mystery surrounding his brother's disappearance several years earlier following the murder of his ex-girlfriend.  Throw in plenty of quirky characters, sex, violence and some drugs ... and that about covers it!  Seriously, the author does a masterful job with the characterizations and deftly keeping the reader on edge. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: an enjoyable read.  Recommended.
B00005JOE8|5.0|At long last, Alan Moore's tale of a post-nuclear England, a fascist government and the lone terrorist/freedom fighter who stood up to it comes to the screen.  It's felt like a long time, especially due to the pushed back release date, but it was certainly worth it. <br />V For Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel written by Alan Moore, who is generally considered to be one of the greatest comics writers of all time.  Moore's stories are known for their political intrigue and amazing ability to look at real-life situations in ways very few other forms of entertainment in any media can.  While the story has changed a little from the 1982 book, the 2006 film still captures the message perfectly. <br />Set in London, England in the near future, it turns out things have gone very wrong in the world.  Due to the military advances of the United States, the world has suffered through a terrible nuclear war.  England is one of the few countries to survive, which is lucky for them, seeing as how they were allies of the US and aided in their military campaign.  For years, there was chaos and panic due to the lack of resources, and things didn't calm down until a new political party was able to come to power.  Led by Adam Sutler (John Hurt), the party promised peace and tranquility.  Unfortunately, in return for peace, the citiznes of England gave up their rights.  Quarantine zones were set up, curfews were enacted, and non-whites, gays, and non-Christians (anyone different) was deemed dangerous, rounded up, and taken away.  Furthermore, free speech, which includes political activism and speaking out against the government, was outlawed.  A secret police force was also set up. <br />One evening, a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) left her home after curfew and was assaulted by the secret police.  They planned on raping her, but a masked vigilante known only as V (Hugo Weaving) came to her rescue.  Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and black leather garments, V effortlessly took out the trio of cops using only knives and his knowledge of the martial arts.  It turns out that V is somewhat of a Batman-type character in the sense that he can effectively use simple weapons, karate, and manipulation of his surroundings to take out his enemies, but he has a definite political agenda.  V is tired of the fascism and means to bring about a better type of goverment.  Using extensive knowledge of the government's inner workings, explosives, and computer hacking skills, V is able to blow up the Old Bailey as well as hack into the media networks. <br />As the story progresses, we slowly learn V's motivations for why he is doing what he is doing, while Chief Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea), a respected party member, begins an investigation of his own as to who V is and what his motives are. <br />It is interesting that, in today's world when the term terrorist is synonymous with evil, a movie whose \\"protagonist\\" is a terrorist would even be made.  However, one has to keep in mind that one man's terrorist is the freedom fighter of someone else (George Washington was most likely seen as a terrorist in the eyes of the British).  Still, V's tactics are brutal, and he is definitely not a hero.  The question that one must ask is how far one must go in pursuit of libery and justice. <br />While there are a few things from the book that didn't make it into the film and there were a few story changes, the film more or less captures Moore's vision (though in the book, V explicitly states that he sought anarchy, while that isn't quite clear in the film).  The politics of this film may seem offensive to people at the extreme sides of the spectrum, but overall, it should intrigue most people.  And for the less politically-minded, it is also a great action film.  Verdict: go see V!
B000002J03|5.0|In my opinion, this was the first ever real heavy metal album. Other people will tell you it was the first Black Sabbath album, but I think this was it. The riffs here were extreemly heavy for their time and influenced a lot of people (Eddie Van Halen got his tapping idea from \\"Heartbreaker\\"). Anybody who wants to know the roots of hard rock should get this album, along with Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\" and Jimi Hendrix's \\"Are You Expierenced\\" (not metal, but is deifnitly an influence). Buy it now!
6302420326|4.0|A very good to great movie adeptation of the<br />assassintaion of our 35th President and the<br />only Catholic President in US history, killed<br />by the CIA, Cold War Military Industrialists,<br />Masons, Zionists and other New World<br />Order types, and our country has been going<br />down hill ever since. Stone misses several<br />key points; the writing on the boxes of arms<br />in Guy Banister's office were in french, not<br />spanish and the F.B.I. use the Masonic Lodge<br />in New Orleans as a Headquarters in 1960<br />(whoops!)! Clay Shaw was a memeber of that<br />Orleans Parish Lodge then and David Dukes<br />today! Great performances by Kostner, Asner,<br />Lemmon, Candy, the Misfit Brigade's Jay O.<br />Sanders, Mike Rooker and many more. I just<br />met a lady who lived in New Orleans and<br />Dallas and worked for Mobil Oil when the<br />movie was filmed in both cities during<br />Stone's shooting of the film! Stone, as<br />always tries to make it out to be a left<br />v. right thing, which hurts his film(s)<br />somewhat (surprising as he was in infantry<br />in Vietnam himself back in '65)! Still<br />Stone's best work to date. Very accurate;<br />check the books, 'The Star Spangled Con-<br />tract' and 'Trail of the Assassins', both<br />by Garrison and available from our friends<br />here at amazon.com. Check out the Col.

B000E8QVWY|5.0|Let me start off by saying Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors in the business. He made us hate him in Gladiator, love him in Ladder 49, and now hate him and love him in Walk the Line.<br /><br />This is a great movie, that in my opinion, should have taken a lot more academy awards than it did. Following the life of Johnny Cash from when he was a kid to when he's a succesful country/rock artist, this movie did a good job portraying Johnny Cash as he was. June Carter fan as a kid, June Carter lover as an adult, and a drug addict for a good portion of his life. Who can forget the scene when Joaquin Phoenix improvised and ripped the sink out of his wall in a rage? And who can forget when June Carter's parents finally tried to sober Johnny up? The drug dealer comes to Johnny's front door and gets a sawed off shotgun barrel jammed into his chest by June's father. Then June's mother, dressed in Sunday best, comes out of the house with HER sawed off shotgun, trained on the drug dealer.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Joaquin and Reese do a phenomenal job singing Cash and Carter's songs, and also do a phenomenal job playing their parts. I was never a Cash fan before I saw this movie, but now I'm tempted to pick up his live record from Folsom prison. 5 star film, no question about it.
B00006ADG8|5.0|Who's the genius that made that decision?  <br /> <br />5 Stars for an excellent film with incredible performances.   <br />0 Stars for the fools that released this timeless classic on an obsolete video format.  <br /> <br />When will a DVD be released? It's pretty sad that Ed Wood has a DVD boxed set, but this awesome Peter Ustinov film is still languishing on VHS.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Any kid who wants to play guitar in an extreem metal band HAS TO own this album. Kerry and Jeff are just insane, trading off leads and shredding, they make it look easy. This also has some of Slayers best songs like \\"Angel of Death\\", \\"Necrophobic\\", \\"Altar of Sacrfice\\", \\"Jesus Saves\\", \\"Reborn\\", and \\"Raining Blood\\". Once again a must have for any extreem metal guitarist, and even if you aren't an extreem metal guitarist you should still get it. It's awesome.<br /><br />P.S.-For that Fall out Boy Lover retard, you have no clue what your talking about. Good Charlotte heavy? Yeah right!

B0002XB8DI|5.0|i really enjoyed all the songs on this single. american idiot, of course, one of their recent superhit charttoppers that they have been called sellouts for(which they are NOT. i really think people are somewhat jelous and resent them becomeing so popular and sucessful, BUT i wont get into that now..). well, AI is a truely great song(gee, maybe tahts why its so popular, eh? to the point of making your ears bleed i am told, but i dont listen to the radio, so.). there is also shoplifter and governater. shoplifter is sort of reverting back to their old warning style a bit, but still with a bit more of their new AI era feel. very good, addictive song. mike dirnt(the bass player, and my god) wrote and sings teh lead vocals in governator. it is really a very great song, my absoloute favorite of the 8(?) or so songs mike has written, and definatly one of my fafvorite songs overall. but it!
B000BEZQ18|5.0|What's on the CD is wonderful.  You get some of the feel from the movie listening to it.  I wish there was more of Gustavo Santaolalla's music on it.   <br />     Missing is the music from the morning after the tent scene, the music for the second tent scene, and the music for the tractor riding and cattle feeding.  It's all wonderful music and I wish it was on this CD.  My hope is they put out a second one that contains everything that's missing from the first.  It all won the Academy Award, not just the cuts on this CD.
B000002H33|5.0|Every band with the right amount of talent at one point releases that one album that just seems perfect. For Metallica, that album was 'Master of Puppets'. This is a really great album. Every single song is great. Amazing guitar solos/riffs, great vocals, great bass, great drums, just a great production in general...I just can't  say enough about this album. It is simply amazing. An essential for any rock fan.

If the Ozzy edition of Black Sabbath had to go out on one song, THIS is the song. YES, it would be GREAT if EVERY song on this album were a Black Sabbath \\"classic.\\" Artists grow, artists take risks, artists deliver, artists surprise, artists disappoint. \\"A Hard Road\\" is worth the price of admission on this CD, and whether it \\"sounds like Black Sabbath\\" or NOT, it's KILLER.
B00003CXIP|5.0|This profanity-ridden 1986 Hollywood film is based on the novella \\"The Body\\" by Jewish-American writer Stephen King - the first and only time he didn't write something quirky. Perhaps it would've been another idiosyncratic Stephen King film had it not been for the excellent directing by Rob Reiner? Stand By Me is good, very good.  It should become one of the Hollywood Club's classics, but many of today's generation never heard of it - and that's a shame.  The acting is superb. The viewer's emotional involvement with the characters is accomplished with a minimum of dialogue - Rob Reiner wastes no footage here.  It's about four 12 year old boys in a small Oregon town, three of whom nearly qualify as misfits by middle class standards, who hear about a dead body and decide to set out on an overnight expedition to find it before anyone else does.<br /><br />The film opens with one of the lads grown into adulthood, Gordie Lachance (played by Richard Dreyfuss) sitting in his car reading a newspaper obituary of one of the other lads \\"Attorney Christopher Chambers Fatally Stabbed in Restaurant\\", page C-3, The Oregonian, Wednesday, September 4, 1985.  He begins to reminisce about the time they set out to find the dead body - \\"I was 12 going on 13 the first time I saw a dead human being.  It happened in the Summer of 1959, a long time ago\\".<br /><br />The adult Gordie Lachance played by Richard Dreyfuss becomes the film's narrator as he recounts his childhood adventure.  The 1959 adventure begins when Vern Tessio (played by Jerry O'Connell) is under his front porch digging small holes in the hopes of discovering the spot where he had buried a jar full of pennies, overhears his older brother and his friend talking about the Dodge car that they stole, and hears they saw a boy that is probably the one that the news has been broadcasting as missing for last three days.  He hears them deduce that Ray Brauer must've been hit by a train when he when off to pick blueberries.  Vern runs to his friends hanging out in a treehouse with the news that if they follow the tracks, they can find a body.<br /><br />His friends are Teddy Duchamp (played by Corey Feldman), Gordie Lachance (played by Wil Wheaton), and Chris Chambers (played by River Phoenix).  Teddy Duchamp reacts by exclaiming that Ray Brauer was \\"our age\\" and they decide to do an overnight 20-mile expedition down the train tracks and locate one of their own fallen pre-teens.  They tell their parents that they are doing sleepovers at each other's houses - and in keeping with the cannon-fodder Hoopieville ways of their parents, none of the parents bother to phone the other parents to check any of this out.  Many blue-collar working class communities were that way during the 50s, 60s, 70s, and even 80s. Many of those older generations can relate to the film's time period and to the characters' behaviors.<br /><br />As these 4 lads make their way down the train tracks, we learn that three of them are suffering from a problem environment exacerbated by problem parents.  Gordie is grieving the death of his older brother 4 months previous, while suffering nightmares in which his father says \\"It should've been you Gordon\\".  Chris is suffering from low self-esteem resulting from the stigma of being a member of a worthless family headed by an alcoholic gun-keeping father (whose pistol Chris has brought along).  Teddy's father was even more abusive than Chris's dad - he was committed to an insane asylum after an abusive attack on Teddy.  Teddy, in turn, tells everyone his dad died storming the beach at Normandy on D-Day, while being haunted by the fact that he has a \\"loonie\\" for a dad.  Vern is the only one of the bunch that is not suffering from some emotional trauma - while the others are cussing away at the absurdities in their lives Vern fondly sings the praises of \\"cherry-flavored PEZ\\".<br /><br />These troubled kids represent real kids that had similar problems growing up in Baby Boomer working-class towns and many of the older generations will relate. Today's generation will find it difficult to relate to these boys - they have no cell phones, no handheld computer games, no rap or hip-hop.  But the boys do encounter a junkyard dog with a vicious reputation, a train dodge on a trestle (not by choice), coyotes, leeches, and teen-aged bullies with a knife-wielding ring leader \\"Ace\\" (played by Keifer Sutherland).  The campfire tale about \\"Lard Ass\\" is hilarious.<br /><br />When the boys do find the body, the bullies show up and pull a knife on Chris.  Gordie shoots Chris's dad's pistol into the air, then aims it at \\"Ace\\" the ringleader.  The bullies leave.  In the end, the boys decide to anonymously phone in the location of Ray Brauer's body.  The prize of finding the body was not as important as was the prize of self-discovery.<br /><br />The adult Gordie played by Richard Dreyfuss concludes by mentioning how though he hadn't seen Chris in 10 years, he will miss him.  And this touches on the American male's general inability to make deep friendships beyond childhood.  If we don't keep our childhood friends, we're lucky to have even one who we can be as close with as we were when we were young, vulnerable, and bonded together in confronting life's absurdities.  Gordie misses Chris; we miss our childhood friends.  A very sentimental movie that is unfortunately timebound.  Kudos to the Hollywood Gang for this one!Boomer working-class towns and many of the older generations will relate.

B00092ZL80|3.0|I was a bit skeptical about getting this, considering that Chicago has been a really cheesy act since, I guess 1976 (I'm NO fan of the corny ballads). I like their earlier, more adventurous work, a la Chicago V. Same goes for EWF. Seeing that there was a bunch of older gems had me pick it up.  <br /> <br />Sonically, this is an amazing DVD, and the older gems are fantastic, from both bands. It opens with an incredible 'Beginnings'. Other hot spots are 'Free' and 'Call on Me', \\"Shining Star' and 'Getaway'.  <br /> <br />Now, here's the problem that makes it impossible for me to watch the whole thing in one sitting... MAJOR CHEESE FACTOR. The way these bands portay themselves is soooooo hammy, between the on-stage high fivin', pointing at random members of the audience, really corny canned dialogue, and general mugging and grinning. I don't know, maybe if I thought the 80's was a great decade I'd appreciate it. It's like a bad Vegas show. It's more akin to what you'd see at a Garth Brooks or Bon Jovi show. When the big American flag drops down behind the stage during 'Free' and the horn section 'salutes', I wanted to puke (esp. considering that in their heyday, Chicago was quite politcal and anti-gov't). <br /> <br />Content wise, about half of it's great, the other half is pretty bad, esp. the Chicago ballads. So I'd say it's worth a rent, but don't know if it's worth buying. That said, if you loved the 80's and all that personified that decade, you'll probably love this DVD.
B00005U122|5.0|Ok, like everyone esle, I am a Pink Floyd fan.  Ok big shock.  What I never got into was the tiff about who is the soul of Floyd.  Roger?  David?  Forget all that. <br /> <br />Makes no difference which you prefer, if indeed you do.  Doesn't matter. <br /> <br />This is hands down the finest Concert DVD I have ever seen and I have seen plenty.  I have a 54inch sony wega and a nice surround sound stero to watch them on and there isn't anything finer. <br /> <br />If you even remotely like Pink Floyd and would like a DVD of some of the great hits.. This is a fine DVD.  Roger Waters is in fine form and the musicians backing him are awesome.  The production value of this DVD is outstanding.  None of the teenager camerawork.  This doesn't look like an MTV concert.   <br /> <br />This is movie quality work.  Get it.  you're gonna love it.  Even if you never heard of Pink Floyd before.  :) <br /> <br /> <br />My Top 3 DVD Concerts. <br />1. Pulse if it ever gets out and meets expectations. <br />2. Roger Waters - In the Flesh <br />3. Roy Orbison - A Black and White Night <br /> <br />Honorable Mention <br />The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over <br /> <br /> <br />Can't go wrong with any of these quality DVDs.
B00005JO9J|5.0|If you have never seen this before, do yourself a favor and get it. IT's amazing. The plot is awesome (so much good drama!), the actors are well chosen, and you learn a lot about the real world (medically speaking, at least).<br /><br />To give you a sense of my taste in television, my favorite show used to be \\"Friends\\" (before Grey's Anatomy was created). I also love \\"One Tree Hill\\" and \\"Family Guy.\\"<br /><br />And if you don't think you're the slightest bit interested in anything medical, get this anyways because it's more about the drama.. trust me, a lot of the show's followers aren't interested in medicine either. There's a reason why there's so much hype about this show.. IT'S GOOD!!!
1558908382|5.0|Buy this DVD if you are looking for an hilarious, unique dark comedy. A hitman, played by John Cusack returns to his hometown to attend his high school reunion and to do a job. He is followed by his arch-rival in professional murder played to perfection by Dan Ackroyd. Exciting, quirky and romantic, you will love this film. Minnie Driver is a perfect romantic match for Cusack. And, by the way, the quality of the DVD image is excellent. My TV has stereo surround sound and the musical soundtrack blew me away.  P.S. If you love 80's music, get the 2 CD's that represent the soundtrack. The soundtrack was done by Joe Strummer of the Clash and it is brilliant!
B000002OX3|4.0|The spotlight reviews state that the \\"title track\\" Happy Jack was removed from this title.  That's only half true.  The original UK album, A Quick One, didn't include Happy Jack (Singles were generally released seperately from albums over there).  When the album was released in the US, the record company renamed it Happy Jack, and that song was added to the end of the album while Heatwave was dropped. Since the album here is the basically the UK version, it is somewhat misleading to state that the title track has been dropped, although I agree that given the bonus material, the inclusion of the original version of Happy Jack should have been added to this release.
B000E97HIA|5.0|In one of the earlier reviews i read, someone gave this album  one star. Well one thing is for sure, that reviewer doesnt know what music really is. 3121 is something we all havn't heared from Prince in a while, with the many uses of synthesizers that i thought he had stopped using years ago. Sure, it's not exactly like his eighties material, but what do you haters want from him? He's been in the buisness for over 20 years and music has changed since then, otherwise, would you rather have him re-use all of his old stuff? No, i didn't think so, so leave him alone about saying his eighties stuff was so much better. The thing that also really bothered me about the one star reviewer was that he said anyone who gives this album 5 stars is beeing paid by a record company to do so. Well, I'm a big Prince fan, and I thought this album was an amazing piece of work. Therefore, I've given it five stars. Hmmmmmmm, well i can honestly say that i wasn't paid to right this review, and i'm also proud to say that this album gets five stars on its own.  <br /> <br />Here's my review of all of the songs: <br /> <br />3121- I was so happy when i heard this song, because it reminded me so much of his earlier work (For example, Sign of the times, and material on The B-sides Box set). <br /> <br />Te Amo Corazon- It was so greatly composed and laid back/It got me relaxed and it was just soothing all together  <br /> <br />Black Sweat- I was also really happy about this song, because it begins to bring back the bad side of Prince, plus it's just got a great vibe to it alltogether. <br /> <br />Incense and Candles- This was such a great song, and he adjusted its sound to the sound of today (with a great use of synthesizers once again) as well as a great beat.  <br /> <br /> <br />Love- This was an ok song..it had it's strong points as well as its weak points but its fine otherwise. <br /> <br />Satisfied-This song is also really laid back and brings back the old Musicology vibe. <br /> <br/>FURY- I MUST SAY THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PRINCE SONGS IVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. IT SHOULD BE THE NEXT SINGLE! <br /> <br />The word- Great song with  great beat to it. <br /> <br />Beautiful, lOved and Blessed- Great song all together with awesome vocals and writing. <br /> <br />Get on the boat-This was such a great song, because it was just so loud and overdone. Probably great to dance to.  <br /> <br />The dance- This was a little chessy at points, but otherwise a good song. <br /> <br />Lolita- A very cool song with great use of intruments and writing.  <br /> <br />Depending on what kind of music you like, or what kind of music you expect from Prince, 3121 is nearly flawless.
630469654X|5.0|I first saw this film back in 1987 over at a high school friend's house and have loved Isabeau and Navarre ever since.  This movie has it all: comedy, drama, and one amazing love story.  Who's heart didn't break on that one scene when the doomed couple could catch a glimpse of each other at sunrise?  Navarre's devotion was utterly breathtaking.  A wonderful, wonderful film.
B0002O39A2|5.0|It was eleven years ago, when in the Cheapo record store (God Bless her) in Uptown Minneapolis, going through the shelves of used cds, I stumbled with one with the strange name of \\"Khan: Space Shanty\\", I looked at the back cover and there they were, four long haired guys, one of them even with a long beard. Among them was Steve Hillage, whose fame rang a little bit my bells, and there was Dave Stewart, of whom I had heard in the two vinyls I used to own of Hatfield and the North. Even so I took it to the desk and asked for a hearing of the disc. Well, it sounded good and it had a good price, four dollars if I recall well. I took it home, and played it, played it, played it..., my goodness, this disc grew and grew in me. 1972, impressive guitar work by Hillage, dreamy keyboard work by Dave Stewart, sound and fascinating rhythm section of Eric Peachey (drums) and Nick Greenwood (bass). The latter and Hillage perform the vocals, which are quite good and coherent with the style of the music played, authentic progressive rock characterized by awesome instrumentation, lots of time signatures, structured improvisation, long instrumental passages punctuated by nice and moving vocals that reinforce the epic feeling pervading the music. Besides, the lyrics composed mainly by Hillage not only transpire the spirit of the seventies, but reach out to a more universal subject, that of the questions and answers that the Human Being keeps on asking and wanting during its existence, set in a science-fictional frame.<br /><br />It was quite strange for me that discovering such a disc in that marvelous Cheapo Record Stores of my adored city of Minneapolis was really a matter of much luck for me, because Space Shanty had been out of print for a long time!!! And not even the few reviews that I found in the internet, even some in the Amazon site, made justice to the value of this masterpiece.<br /><br />I celebrate the reissue of such a wonder!!! I bought it again in Amazon, and here I give testimony that the purchase is worthwhile. This reissue contains two bonus tracks, plus a valuable commentary by a critic called Mark Powell. It is sad that this is the one and only record that this group made. That what did I do with my old disc? Well, after graduating in the University of Minnesota I live in my country now, the Dominican Republic, and thinking that good music must be shared, and already having the reissued one, I donated it to a former student of mine, 23 years old, who was struck by this awesome music.<br /><br />Isn't that enough proof that this disc is worthy of all this praise?

B00005JMAH|1.0|I'm sorry, but i think this is the worst in the series (Movie Wise) <br /> <br />Where did the color go? Why would they choose Gary Oldman to play Sirius Black? Why did they never tell you how Moony knew how to use and close the map from prying eyes? Why oh why didnt they give harry the firebolt in the proper place instead of at the end? <br />Why oh why did they make this movie, which as a book is longer than the previous 2, shorter as a movie than the one before.  <br /> <br />I hate when Directors take liberties that ruin the integrity of the books ideas. I know J.K Rowling said she liked the way he did it, but I honestly think that its a craptastic version of PoA. I dont know why people are afraid of long movies. When they are entertaining, no one really notices. Besides.. <br /> <br />Braveheart - Long and highly praised <br />Titanic - Long and highly praised <br />Lord Of The Rings - Long and highly praised AND properly adapted. <br />Harry Potter books 3 & 4 - Ruined in heart and soul. <br /> <br />People who only see the movies will be missing so much information. I think the only reason why either of the 2 newer films were even remotely palatable was since I HAD read the books, I had some information that the movie just expected you to know.  <br /> <br />However, since I know a lot of people who wait for the movie to come out, and havent picked up a book since they graduated... they are lost and generally consider the last 2 films to be just as much rubbish as I do.. <br /> <br />Take a hint from Peter Jackson.. make the film for the fans.. not the Movie Execs.
B00005JKDR|4.0|The writer's of this story had to be on some serious \\"mind-blowing\\" drugs.<br /><br />The concept here is so original.  No other movie, ever, has invented a story of incredible uniqueness, such as this.<br /><br />Imagine, a power plant.  And how it runs is by monster's going through doors, to go into children's room's and scaring them in their sleep.  The screams of the children fill cylinders that are attached to the door's outside.  The louder the scream, the more power has been collected.  Monster's compete with each other to become \\"scarer of the month\\".  And the power plant employees (the monsters) all have to avoid contamination. Which, in this case, is having the children they scare or any of the children's belongings (socks, toys, etc.) touch them.<br /><br />I believe that this film was made for an adult audience.  Not that it's vulgar or suggestive, but only because of it's about a power plant (something that children wouldn't care about).  And all the basic routines of working at a power plant that may obviously be far beyond a typical child's comprehension.<br /><br />This film is so \\"out there!\\"  I absolutely love it.  And it looks so good on a high-definition TV and my high definition digital-to-digital HDMI DVD player.  It's a great demonstration DVD for my awesome new TV.
B000BVD460|5.0|If this is indeed the final album of Eminem's career as hip-hop's edgiest, and perhaps most-hated, rapper, then it's only appropriate that he goes out flying on his best hits. And if it is his last, then this is a sad album to end a career with, for it came almost unexpectedly not even a full year after his last album, Encore.<br /><br />Curtain Call is a collection of Eminem's best songs from past albums and performances, and includes three never-before-heard tracks. \\"Fack,\\" sung by the Southpark character Cartman, is an off-the-wall rap that basically hits all ends of the taboo spectrum while staying as hilarious as possible, though this is a song that people will find offensive. \\"Shake That,\\" is almost a true rap, sung with the help of Nate Dogg, and is actually kind of benign considering Em's other songs. \\"When I'm Gone\\" is a song sung to his daughter and pretty much says that Em is done with this stuff and wants nothing more than to be a father and a role-model to his children. This song is one of the best he's done, and kind of leaves a feeling of loss on the future of rap and Eminem.<br /><br />Also included are two of the most influential songs Eminem had ever been a part of, including the Oscar winning \\"Lose Yourself,\\" and \\"Stan,\\" both the Dido version and the Elton John version. To me, it was actually the Elton John \\"Stan\\" that sold this album to me, for I had seen this when it was shown on TV, and it blew me away considering all that was being said about Em at the time. You can even hear the surprised cheers in the background when Elton sings his verse.<br /><br />But as a whole, this still is an excellent CD. Perhaps a little early for a greatest hits album, but the four tracks that can't be found anywhere else make it worth it. And this is definitely his greatest raps. It has all the most emotional and powerful songs from his previous four albums. If you're a fan of Eminem then this is a buy for you, or if you like Em but haven't been able to collect his albums then this is a perfect CD for you.lect his albums then this is a perfect CD for you.

The singer is the best ever, the keyboardist and drummer are twin brothers and Malmsteens chops and tone are holding the metal scene hostage with lethal weapons. He slaughters naysayers and burys them with taste. This is a five star neo classical extraviganza!!!
0684824906|4.0|Much has been written on the Civil War and this most famous of Presidents--Goodwin takes a fresh look at Lincoln through the eyes of the politicians and cabinet of the time. She credits Lincoln with assembling a cabinet of powerful and smart men, many of whom were rivals for the presidency, and keeping them in line with a mixture of personal charm, sincere caring and shrewd manipulation when required. Supremely confident, he knew when Chase was campaigning behind his back for the nomination in 1864 yet kept him on in Treaury until the bank was full--and then quickly accepted Chase's oft-proffered resignation. He ignored the snubs of big city lawyers and made them allies during the war. He resisted the pressures of the radicals in his party and waited until he felt the nation would accept emancipation before making his famous proclamation. <br /> <br />His assasination was truly tragic for the South, and his death altered the course of history in a way most other changes in the presidency have not. As the war drew to its inevitable, bloody close, he wanted nothing more than to bring the South and its citizens back into the fold, while many around him sought revenge and reparations. As we know, his successor Johnson was unable to resist the pressure, and we live with the results even now.   <br /> <br />Goodwin is an unabashed admirer of Lincoln's, even to the point of attempting to prove that Lincoln believed in true equality for the black man, a view almost unheard of in those days. It shouldn't offend us today if we were to discover that he believed in the \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine, or felt blacks might require some special status. We know for sure he was a proponent of resettling former slaves in Africa, not understanding that the United States was their home as much as anyone else's. The evidence is slim on these points, but that's evidence of the practical, political side of Lincoln--he didn't stake out positions that were unnecessarily controversial, didn'tchange policy until he thought people would accept it.   <br /> <br />Goodwin's book is a hefty 750+ pages of text with another 150 or so of notes. At times the endless machinations of minor characters was wearying--I thought several times that a good editor perhaps should have intervened. But by and large, this is a very well-written, masterful look at the perhaps most turbulent time in our nation's history.
B0000057C5|5.0|Upon hearing this album in highschool I was burned. I knew that guitars were cool again and that german could be perfect with those guitars. Me and my highschool friends wondered outloud what \\"Du hast mich\\" could mean. We had absolutely no clue as to what they were saying at any time. However, we knew it was cool, and that it was worth headbanging and airguitaring for. We asked our german exchange student friend what they were saying. He said ... \\"they are saying weird things\\". He also said in Deutschland they are free to blow fire out of the stage and all hin und her and uberall! We said that was cool with us. It still is
B000E97HIA|5.0|3121 is Prince's best effort in years.  He sounds great vocally.  I think  all the musicians playing on this album sound very good too.  My favorite track is Beautiful Loved and Blessed.  This is a song about how the person you are in love with makes you feel.  Tamar Braxton shines singing with Prince on this track.  I think she has such a pretty voice.  I also loved the tracks Te Amo Corazon and The Dance.  These are very romantic songs with a very sensual feel to them.  Black Sweat and Get On The Boat are two songs that will get you moving.  Black Sweat  doesn't make me sweat, but I really liked the funky beat to it.  I think Fury is another standout track on this album too.  Prince plays the electric guitar with such energy on this song.  3121 is a very entertaining album.  I enjoyed it very much.
B000006Z1X|5.0|There is an album missing here. The studio album with steve vai called \\"dangerous moves\\" or something like that. I'm a big Malmsteen fan, but I found that Alcatrazz is better without him. Steve Vai, though not even trying to capture what Malmsteen so perfectly displayed on stage, does what he came to do and the band just shines and shines. It's another magic moment in the dawn of heavy metal. Who says lightning doesn't strike twice in the same band?
0307276902|4.0|I just want to say...WHO CARES IF EVERY WORD IS TRUE OR NOT? Memory is a crazy thing and if you are not a writer, you can't totally understand what it is like to write about memories. I could care less if every word is true or not - how true are our actual memories? I don't even care about the \\"message\\" of this book - I just care about reading something that provokes thinking, change, feeling...Are we now going to revisit every memoir and decide whether or not every fact is true or not - and if it's not should we put warning labels on them? The book is very good - not great - regardless.
B000001FN8|2.0|The album isn't THAT horrible, but to me it is a shame that here is this great band that's been making all the deepest stuff over here and the rockinist stuff over there finally has everybody's attention and they turn out a platter that is such a blatent reflection of the commercial climate of the day. I like to watch the video for \\"When Passion Rules the Game\\" for yuks, but when it comes to the video \\"from Russia with Love and other Savage Amusements\\".... that's when I feel sad. Great band pushing these god awful hair metal ballads that have absolutely no artistic value. If you disagree with me consult exibit A. the videos.
B000EGF0B4|2.0|As a movie and measuring the entertainment value, this movie really has none. Just because it is different does not make it good. The characters are not very believable and the story lacks substance. A man who is straight all of his life and then one day wakes up in a tent with another man. Choosing to cheat on his wife just because of an urge. Fine if that is the story, but how can you feel for a character that does not feel he should be responsible to his own family?  The movie should have been stronger is its portrayal of the consequences one must endure when you do something so vile as cheating. Basic Instinct the movie comes to mind. He cheated and had to go throw some serious hell because of it which he justly deserved.<br /><br />I still give it 2 stars. Though the acting was bad, still has some minor entertainment value but best served to wait until it comes out on a premium cable channel.  Not worth spending extra $$.
B00000295Y|5.0|Although Cypress Hill is as laid back as they portray themselves to be, they can very much bring color, ingenuity and astonishing lyrics. From tracks like 'I Want to Get High' to 'Insane in the Membrane', this is one of the best rap albums in the past two decades.  <br /> <br />This team of three originated from latin poetry in the mid-80s to a hardcore rap format. Influenced by the likes of Wu Tang and Public Enemy, Cypress Hill have managed to make many hits, and along the line influence Naughty By Nature, Redman and Dialated People. This album is exceptional in the sense that the lyrics are humorous, factual, powerful and poetic.  <br /> <br />This group is legendary for their constant refrence to weed; a source that potentially helped them become one of the most popular artists in rap. This is a five-star album - enjoyable and a timeless classic.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Live From Las Vegas is fantastic!!! The best show ive ever seen... realy and i've been to a few!!! Even thought i didnt see her live in Las Vegas. I saw her in London in the UK, she was still preformed a Unbelievable show on DVD and was just like watchin her when i did in London. By the way, Britney does sing some songs live, like 'Baby One More Time', 'Not A Girl Not Yet A Women' and 'Sometimes' and the reason why she Occasionally does not sing live is because she jumps around and dances and would be out of breathe qucikly... so for that reason she can sing live!!! <br />A realy excellent buy!!! would recommend to any Britney fans!!!
B00005RRHC|5.0|This is one of the single best movies I have ever watched.  The writing is brilliant. The acting is fabulous.  Emma Thompson dropping her robe and telling Stephen Fry to \\"fill [her] with his babies\\" is one of my favorite cinematic moments of all time. I hope this comes out on dvd soon.

0684824906|5.0|In Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, author Doris Goodwin asks how anybody so \\"ordinary\\" can be elected president in the face of so many extremely well qualified rivals, and then work with these rivals to become unarguably the greatest president in the history of this country.<br /><br />Goodwin answers these questions in a readable and logical manner, and in a way that does professional history good:  use of primary sources, an initial hypothesis, and eminently readable prose.<br /><br />This book will have everybody find favorite snippets of wisdom, and you cannot help but compare the presidency of Lincoln to current presidents -- what they say, who they appoint, what they take credit for doing, what they take responsibility for, and what they accomplish.  The standard Lincoln sets for all future presidents, as portrayed by Goodwin, is extremely high.<br /><br />Here are some of the gems I discovered:<br /><br />\\" Especially do I regret that I spent so much of my time in reading novels and other light works.  They may impart a little brilliancy to the imagination but at length, like an intoxicating draught, they enfeeble and deaden the powers of thought and action.\\"  Salmon Chase, 1827, who never became president. (p. 38)<br /><br />\\"Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition.  I have no other as great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem.  How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be developed.\\"  Abraham Lincoln, 1832. (p. 87, 743)<br /><br />\\"Now he belongs to the ages.\\"  Edwin Stanton, on the death of Lincoln, 1865. (p. 743)<br /><br />\\"... we should never knowingly lend ourselves directly or indirectly, to prevent that slavery from dying a natural death - to find new places for it to live in, when it can no longer exist in the old.\\"  Abraham Lincoln, 1845. (p. 123)<br /><br />\\"One of Lincoln's favorite anecdotes sprang from the early days just after the revolution.  Shortly after the peace was signed, the story began, the revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen `had occasion to visit England,' where he was subject to considerable teasing banter.  The British would make `fun of the Americans and General Washington in particular and one day they got a picture of General Washington' and displayed it prominently in the outhouse so Mr. Allen could not miss it. When he made no mention of it, they finally asked him if he had seen the Washington picture.  Mr. Allen said, `he thought that it was very appropriate [place] for an Englishman to Keep it.  Why they asked, for said Mr. Allen there is Nothing that Will Make an Englishman S*** So quick as the Sight of Genl Washington.'\\" (p. 151)<br /><br />\\"With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed.  Consequently he who moulds public sentiment, goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions.\\" Abraham Lincoln, 1858. (p. 206, 469)<br /><br />\\"I frequently make mistakes myself, in the many things I am compelled to do hastily.\\"  Abraham Lincoln, 1863. (p. 527)<br /><br />\\"If I had my way, this war would never have been commenced; if I had been allowed my way this war would have been ended before this, but we find it still continues; and we must believe that He permits it for some wise purpose of his own, mysterious and unknown to us; and though with our limited understandings we may not be able to comprehend it, yet we cannot but believe, that He who made the world still governs it.\\"  Abraham Lincoln, 1862.  (p. 562)<br /><br />\\"The next week, Lincoln related a peculiarly pleasant dream.  He was at a party, he told Hay, and overheard one of the guests say of him, `He is a very common-looking man.'  In the dream, he relished his reply: `The Lord prefers Common-looking people that is the reason he makes so many of them.'\\" (p. 593)<br /><br />\\"Lincoln considered his meetings with the general public his `public-opinion baths.' They `serve to renew in mea clearer and more vivid image of that great popular assemblage out of which I sprung,' he told a visitor, `and though they may not be pleasant in all their particulars, the effect, as a whole, is renovating and invigorating to my perceptions of responsibility and duty.'\\" (p. 598)<br /><br />\\"To be wounded in the house of one's friends is perhaps the most grievous affection that can befall a man.\\"  Abraham Lincoln.

0930289528|4.0|I saw this film last weekend and a friend recomended I read the graphic novel. This was the first graphic novel I have ever read. Now I can say I wish I had read the novel first, it gives you more insight into the characters. The film is more compact and emphasizes a more politcial and moral base. The novel has more a \\"pulp fiction\\" feel.<br /><br />I do not want to give too much away but will say there is a difference in the begining sequence when Evey meets up with the Finger Men. There is a relationship (that Evey has) and a few subplots from the novel that never make it into the film version. The endings are a bit different - see the film and read the novel and you can decide which you prefer.<br /><br />I am glad that this was the first graphic novel I read because it has good character development and is entertaining. The illustartions compliment the story and even add to it. Other graphic novels I looked at were overwhemling visually. That was not the case with this novel.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Author Truman Capote, he of fluff \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" fame, throttled the literary world by going into an altogether different - and certainly uncharacteristic - direction in his subsequent work \\"In Cold Blood.\\" But the direction his work took him, not only according to this unsettling bio-drama and other corraborative accounts, was into moral and ethical disintegration. And, by his life's end, Capote's post-\\"In Cold Blood\\" professional and personal meltdown cost him his very soul. Such is the excrutiating pain in this, screenwriter Dan Futterman's depiction of Capote's life in the seven-year period (1959-66) that \\"In Cold Blood\\" consumed Capote, beginning the weekend of Nov. 14, 1959, in America's rural Bible Belt where a farming family of four in Holcomb, Kan., was methodically slaughtered, and beyond the executions April 14, 1965, of the two killers. A New York Times story about the savage murders caught the attention of Capote, then a free lance writer for Vanity Fair and basking in his recent claim to fame courtesy of \\"Breakfast ...\\" From New York, Capote sets out for Kansas with a colleague, Harper Lee, herself unknowingly on the verge of literary acclaim with her work, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird.\\" In gaining the trust and help of the locals despite his \\"flamboyancy,\\" Capote also earns the same from his subjects, killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock. But in getting what he needs from his subjects, Capote sacrifices both his professional and personal ethics and morals, and it is that which is the basis for this film, deservedly rated as one of 2005's best movies. In the title role, Philip Seymour Hoffman validates his Best Actor Oscar by ingeniously aoviding the pathetic parody that could have been made of Capote's life. So absolutely convincing is Hoffman as Capote that we have to remind ourselves that who we're seeing isn't the real man. \\"Capote,\\" however, doesn't answer but alludes to why the real man sacrificed his moral and ethical direction, be it for another shot of self-serving fame or because he developed a risky - and costly - personal relationship with one of the killers (Smith). But the film doesn't claim to answer that question and instead focuses on the dynamics of Capote's meltdown. Caught in his fallout is co-writer Harper Lee, Capote's quiet voice of conscience and logic, and actress Catherine Keener serves up an Oscar-caliber performance as well. As Capote disintegrates privately, Lee rises professionaly to literary legend status with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" and so self-abosrbed is Capote that he cannot share in his friend's professional success. And it is one of Capote's comments to himself, at the premier of the film version of Lee's literary masterpiece, that makes us uneasy with what Capote had apparently become: of his colleague's novel, Capote mutters, \\"I frankly don't see what the fuss is all about.\\" By film's end, after the execution of both his subjects, Capote is on a plane headed back to New York and - we also are led to conclude - into irretrievable moral and ethical condemnation. In portraying Capote, Hoffman superbly rises above mere mimicking of his subject and presents Capote as a complex and psychologically torn but self-absorbed man who got too close as a writer to his story's sources and, in the process, tragically compromised his own soul. Through it all, however, and years after Capote's death, \\"In Cold Blood\\" nonetheless has gained classic status and, arguably perhaps, Capote never bettered himself before or after. And this film is justly regarded as one of the best of 2005, and it and Hoffman's unsettling but masterful performance are must-see's.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Not the best Next Gen. film (that was First Contact), nor the best Star Trek (I'd say 4 or 6), but definitely a good way to end the series. All lose ends are tied up, great villian, great acting, great action, the Romulans (the last great villians after the Borg were demolished via the Voyager finale, the Dominion defeated in DS9, and the Klingons made peace in ST6) finally seem on the verge of making friends as well. Troi gets to use her mental powers for like the first time since the series ended and Guinan (and Wesley via special edition) comes back one more time.     Some say the supporting cast (Riker, LaForge, Beverly) didn't have a big enough role, but most original films (except maybe the classics 4 and 6) gave Scotty, Chekov, Sulu and Uhura just a few lines, typically centering around the frienship between Kirk, Spock and McCoy as well as these center around Picard and Data.     It also revisted the Star Trek morals about humanity and making oneself better than they are, being open-minded and pursuing your greatest potential, all the feel good themes of Gene Roddenberry's orginal vision of the future.    Finally a franchise that ends on a good note.
6300268985|4.0|Indispensable, cult-status Ken Russel movie (not only for fans of The Who), that masterfully captures and subversively portrays on screen classical piano player/composer Frantz Liszt's personality: a legendary genious of a man whose life and times match that of a Rock star, 100 years before Rock was invented. If Glenn Gould is the flamboyant 20th century classical piano player that rocked an establishment, just watch this movie to compare the original Master on his heyday.<br /><br />Unfortunatelly however, VHS does not deliver. The movie should've long ago been digitally transfered on DVD. Don't get mislead by Amazon referring to this product as DVD 1992 release, it's default listing manner. If you look closely by the picture it's actually VHS edition only. True, Warner still persist not to release it on DVD, obviously they don't expect a blockbuster out of it. Guess we'll have to wait for Criterion Collection to salvage it. 4* for the movie, 0* for Warner.
6305171769|5.0|Halloween H20 was a great way to close the series. Salutes and tributes to horror were all over the film with scenes referencing scenes from the original film (the sightings out the window in the middle of class) to icon cameos (Janet Leigh (Jamie Lee Curtis's mother/Psycho star) and the return of I&II's chain smoking nurse) to an opening tribute to Donald Pleasance via a voice over of classic lines from Halloween I.  <br /> <br />Also good casting which became few are far between at the sequel attempts after Halloween II (Josh Harnett became a super heartthrob and Michelle Williams recently garnered an Academy Award nonination).  <br /> <br />Just trust me when I say, buy Halloween , Halloween II and this film. Great acting and great rich story. Pretend the rest never  existed.
0064430170|1.0|I never even heard of this book until about 10 years ago, when suddenly it appeared on every \\"must read\\" list going.  I like children's stories, even those most would deem boring, but this has got to be one of the most BORING books ever written, and the muted black and white illistrations just make it worse!  My two boys like everything, including technical books and three word baby books, but THEY HATE THIS BOOK!  They beg me NOT to read it to them.
B000002AEN|5.0|If you like to hear Mississippi John Hurt, this is a very good  <br />group of early music he sang.  I like it very much, and I bought it as a gift for a family member never thinking I would get \\"hooked\\" on him as much as the family member was.  This open my eyes to some wonderful music. I'm glad I bought for someone else and got to listen to it myself.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I watched this after listening to and reading some of the hype surrounding it but I have to admit it was such a let down!. How anyone can claim it is the scariest american movie in 10 years is beyond me. The first half of the film contains absolutely no scares whatsoever. Just the typical story of 3 backpackers looking to get laid. Initially helped out by the 'friendly locals who turn out to have a hidden agenda (oooh!)(See Wolf Creek - just as bad) Unfortunately what it lacks in originality it doesn't make up for in any other area. The gory scenes in the second half are totally over the top and unoriginal. The only thing that makes a film like this even remotely scary is the fact that you think woahh! tht could really happen!. Yes, and so could alot of other things. Films like this are having to get bloodier and bloodier to try and shock the audience but it just doesn't work. I've seen 100's of horror films over the years and this one rates near the bottom. Why Quentin Tarrantino has got involved I will never know. Give it a miss unless you are really bored!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Very smooth  most enjoyable especially after hearing it the second and third time it grows on you.
B000E97HIA|5.0|I honeslty like this album a little better than Musicology.  It has a very different vibe with the exeption of Satisfied which sounds like it could have fit the album. <br /> <br />3121 <br />Great track with a \\"camile\\" vibe to it. Still don't know what 3121 stands for though. <br /> <br />Lolita <br />An interesting track about a fine young girl who is trying to get in prince's pants.  \\"lolita you're sweeta but you'll never make a cheater out of Prince\\" <br /> <br />Te Amo Corazon <br />An awesome soothing love song with once again a steller string arrangement by long time Prince friend Clare Fischer. <br /> <br />Black Sweat <br />A funky very danceable track.  Don't know what the difference between working up a black sweat and working up a white sweat other than if a white person said working up a white sweat they'd be called a racist (stupid double standard).  Anyway, love the track other than that. <br /> <br />Incense And Candles <br />A seductive track in which Prince seems to be battling the urge to sing about sex without singing about sex.  Love this track, but wish it was nastier. <br /> <br />Love <br />A funky fast track that you could also dance to. <br /> <br />Satisfied <br />A simple trying not to be sexual blues song.  Good song but in my opinion the weakest track on the album. <br /> <br />Fury <br />Great song with a great message.  another funky fast track.  Ain't no fury like a woman scorned. <br /> <br />The Word <br />Hate this song being an agnostic.  Not a bad song, just doesn't do it for me because I'm not religious. <br /> <br />Beautiful Loved and Blessed <br />Love this song.  I'll admit it had to grow on me.  Seeing the SNL performance of this helped it to grow on me.  Tamar sounds great.  Hope her album is good. <br /> <br />The Dance <br />Lyrically basically the same version as the NPG music club version.  Musically very different.  I love the original, but I really like the new vibe of this one too, expecially the ending where Prince is sounding desperate intentionally to make his point to the woman.   <br /> <br />Get On The Boat <br />I don't love or hate this song.  It may grow on me, but at this point could do without it. <br /> <br />Overall I love this album.  Some argue the old Prince is back, but I agree with the fan that said it depends on what your definition of the old Prince is.  Truthfully, unless he stops being a Jehovah's Witness that will probably never happen. My only overall complaint is the subtle religious vibes that occassionally creep into some of the tracks.  Hope he gets out of the religion thing because The Rainbow Children was enough preaching for any die hard prince fan to endure.  I know that sounds selfish, but it's how I feel.  As long as he's happy.  That's what counts.  I own every Prince album and I must say I'd put it up there in top half of my favorite albums.  Probaby my favorite work since The Gold Experience.
B000006OBQ|5.0|Here he is in all his perfection. From the moment William Conrad introduces him till the time he leaves the stage it is  flawless. Is it any wonder on his greatest hits they use the \\"Under My Skin\\" version from this concert? He is in tip top vocal and he has the Count, not hitting one unecessary note as usual, bringing him along in harmonious splendor. Song after song and the banter in between is just right. I have never seen Sinatra live, in answer to a previous review, and I don't need to because this production transforms me there. And isn't that the essence of a live recording? To take you to that place and time. This production does not diminish with every play like 99.9% of every other recording. I play it as often, minimum once a week, and it just gets better. That is the true testament of a master as he and Mr. Basie display in full form.
B00000DOZE|5.0|\\"...And Then There Were Three\\" was originally released in March of 1978, and it's the first Genesis album following Steve Hackett's departure from the band in 1977.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong here--I'm not denying Hackett's compositional talent or his distinctive fluid guitar style.  However, many fans have grossly overstated the importance of Steve Hackett's departure from Genesis.  The sound of \\"And Then There Were Three\\" is very, very similar to that of the previous album \\"Wind & Wuthering\\".  Okay, so there aren't any classical guitar spotlights a la \\"Blood On The Rooftops\\" on here, but overall, the albums are very sonically similar, and Hackett just wasn't spotlighted enough on the two previous albums, either compositionally or performance-wise, for his loss to be felt all that much.<br /><br />Tony Banks, Phil Collins, and Mike Rutherford had such an incredible working relationship and chemistry together, as Genesis' 1978-1991 output monumentally demonstrates, that Hackett's leaving the group was undoubtedly for the best.  That's not to say things wouldn't have been interesting had Hackett stayed.  What seems to be overlooked by most of the fans who accuse Genesis of 'going pop' following Hackett's departure, is that Hackett himself basically 'went pop' in his own right on his 1981 solo album \\"Cured\\".  All that said, it seems obviously clear that Hackett didn't leave Genesis due to them becoming 'too poppy', he left because he felt suffocated by the other guys and wasn't getting enough of his own compositions in.<br /><br />In any case, \\"...And Then There Were Three\\" finds Genesis brilliantly carrying on without Hackett.  Mike Rutherford was a fine guitarist in his own right, and even Banks played guitar (although not on this album if I understand correctly), so filling in the guitar parts was no big deal.  And either way, you've still got the dense layers of keyboards from Banks and the tremendous drumming from Collins.<br /><br />The album starts offwith the dynamite \\"Down And Out\\".  An icy intro gives way to a frenetic rocker with manical Collins drumming on the verses which are in a 10-4 time signature, giving the song an incredibly powerful, hyperactive feel.  This is heavy duty progressive rock, folks.  The rumor is that the lyrics pertain to Hackett's depature from the band, but it seems to deal more with the band feeling at odds with the 'pop music scene' of the late '70s.<br /><br />\\"Undertow\\" is one of those wistful, lyrically vivid Banks ballads, with his beloved Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano sound, and a soaring chorus--an absolutely beautiful song.  Also beautiful is Rutherford's spiritually-oriented ballad \\"Snowbound\\", with Collins singing the verses in that incredibly tender, feathery 'little guy' voice that's characteristic of him for this era (although it would forever vanish by the time of 1981's \\"Abacab\\").  The melancholy \\"Many Too Many\\" is marred a tad by overly prominent synth-strings, but it's still undeniably moving, with stirringly emotional choruses; it's surprising that it's a Banks solo composition--it sounds very Rutherford-esque.  And even if you're burnt out on the feel-good radio hit \\"Follow You Follow Me\\", there's no denying it's superbly melodic, and it's neatly enhanced by Rutherford's heavily chorused/ flangered electric guitar.<br /><br />There's a surprising turn toward Wild West thematics on \\"Ballad Of Big\\" and Rutherford's \\"Deep In The Motherlode\\", great songs, each in the 4 or 5 minute range, with the usual huge hooks and dynamics that we expect from these guys.  The fade on \\"...Motherlode\\" makes effective use of backwards reverb on the drums.  Banks' longer, 7+ minute \\"Burning Rope\\" perhaps drags a tad, but that's splitting hairs--it's darn great, with a terrific intro featuring masterful Collins drum fills.  The sprightly \\"Scenes From A Night's Dream\\" is a wonderfully catchy pop-rock flavored tune, with terrific ringing guitars and ethereal background vocals.<br /><br/>Banks offers another 6+ minute epic with \\"The Lady Lies\\".  It's a story-song somewhat along the lines of the previous album's \\"All In A Mouse's Night\\".  The lyrics, about a femme fatale, are fairly lame and highly obvious, but the music is a different story...  The verses are naturally sly and insinuating, and this is contrasted with an absolutely gorgeous chorus, plus there's a spine-tingling mid-section with a great Banks solo spot.<br /><br />All in all, despite some minor gripes here and there, I can hardly say enough positive things about \\"...And Then There Were Three\\".  This is the start of an unparalled streak of musical brilliance from the Banks-Collins-Rutherford lineup of Genesis.
006056251X|4.0|IMPRESSIONS:<br />This story had SUCH potential and I was really looking forward to reading it after having read the second Wallflower story, [[ASIN:0061259330 It Happened One Autumn (The Wallflowers, Book 2)]]. I mean what more could you want: the horrible Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent, who is unashamedly sensual and unremorseful, Evie Jenner, a sweet, stammering wallflower who you just KNOW is going to get him whipped, and Lisa Kleypas writing the story! I was litterally sitting on the edge of my seat. But so many times I felt that the story fell a little short; when she could have made a scene a real killer it just didn't have that usual hit quality that she normally always delivers. One example is the ring that is put on the necklace, it could have been discovered in a much better way by Evie or the delivery could have been better. Another thing which bothered me was that Sebastian seemed to transform so quickly, if he did transform that quickly I would have liked him to maybe be more in denial about it or just to have him be a little meaner for a little longer (as horrible as that sounds). Nonetheless, it must be said, that the story is still fun to read and I still have to say: You can't go wrong with a Kleypas.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATIONS:<br />If you like Kleypas (and really, how can you NOT?) then read and enjoy, but don't expect it to be as good as some of her best ones, such as [[ASIN:038077352X Dreaming of You]] (one of my favorites), [[ASIN:0380802317 Where Dreams Begin]] (so great!), [[ASIN:0380811073 Worth Any Price (Bow Street, Book 3)]] (amazing!), and I could go on and on. However, if this is your first time reading Kleypas, know that she has even better ones out there, so keep on reading!<br /><br />UPDATE (1/13/2008):<br />I've read this book a few times again - I reread a lot of my historical romances and all of my Lisa Kleypas ones - and when compared with many of the new authors and books I've read recently, I wish I could change this to a four star review. Although it wasn't Kleypas's best, compared to other authors in the genre she really is an amazing writer and storyteller. I still agree with the criticisms I made above, but [[ASIN:006056251X The Devil in Winter (The Wallflowers, Book 3)]] definitely doesn't deserve only three stars.'t Kleypas's best, compared to other authors in the genre she really is an amazing writer and storyteller.

B00002EPJH|5.0|The first few moment of listening to Keith Jarrett playing caused such an emotional response, I spent the next hour listening and listening and literally crying from the sheer beauty of his playing. Nothing has touched me quite as deeply. Then when I learned the amazing story behind this CD, I was even more moved to tears.<br /><br />The entire experience has been very emotional for me. After listening to this at least 20 times I can now almost make it through the CD without crying. Each delicate note is exquisite in perfection and draws a certain spiritual beauty around itself as it captures moods and moments and eternal significance.<br /><br />The first piece opens your heart and then you are lost in sound, captured by radiance, throw into a spinning of ecstasy. This may be an understatement for to describe how profound this music is, is to fall short in sentences that do it no justice at all. Inspired perfection? How can one describe the emotions and the strength pouring from the piano because they are floating and skipping through happiness, almost reborn as Keith Jarrett himself is reborn and starts to play the piano again after an illness almost ends his career.<br /><br />You could listen to this and do nothing at all and be in musical ecstasy. Relaxing, profoundly beautiful, a soul escape. Essential to any romantic's collection. To understand my reaction to this CD, watch the DVD: Keith Jarrett Art of Improvisation. It is an excellent introduction to Keith Jarrett's art and will introduce you to his wife. He wrote this for his wife and this might also explain why this awakens the heart and comforts the soul.<br /><br />Last Solo is also an excellent look at Keith Jarrett as an artist and is highly recommended.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

0316926345|5.0|Published in 1945, this novel, which Waugh himself sometimes referred to as his \\"magnum opus,\\" was originally entitled \\"Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder.\\"  The subtitle is important, as it casts light on the themes--the sacred grace and love from God, especially as interpreted by the Catholic church, vs. the secular or profane love as seen in sex and romantic relationships.  The tension between these two views of love--and the concept of \\"sin\\"--underlie all the action which takes place during the twenty years of the novel and its flashbacks.<br /><br />When the novel opens at the end of World War II, Capt. Charles Ryder and his troops, looking for a billet, have just arrived at Brideshead, the now-dilapidated family castle belonging to Lord Marchmain, a place where Charles Ryder stayed for an extended period just after World War I, the home of his best friend from Oxford, Lord Sebastian Flyte.  The story of his relationship with Sebastian, a man who has rejected the Catholicism imposed on him by his devout mother, occupies the first part of the book.  Sebastian, an odd person who carries his teddy bear Aloysius everywhere he goes, tries to escape his upbringing and religious obligations through alcohol.  Charles feels responsible for Sebastian's welfare, and though there is no mention of any homosexual relationship, Charles does say that it is this relationship which first teaches him about the depths of love.<br /><br />The second part begins when Charles separates from the Flytes and his own family and goes to Paris to study painting.  An architectural painter, Charles marries and has a family over the next years.  A chance meeting on shipboard with Julia, Sebastian's married sister, brings him back into the circle of the Flyte family with all their religious challenges.  Three of the four Flyte children have tried to escape their religious backgrounds, and this part of the novel traces the extent to which they have or have not succeeded in finding peace in the secular world.  \\"No one is ever holy without suffering,\\" he believes.<br /><br />Dealing with religious and secular love, Heaven and Hell, the concepts of sin and judgment, and the guilt and punishments one imposes on oneself, the novel also illustrates the changes in British society after World War II.  The role of the aristocracy is less important, the middle class is rising, and in the aftermath of war, all are searching for values.  A full novel with characters who actively search for philosophical or religious meaning while they also search for romantic love, Brideshead Revisited is complex and thoughtfully constructed, an intellectual novel filled with personal and family tragedies--and, some would say, their triumphs. n Mary Whippleeeded in finding peace in the secular world.  \\"No one is ever holy without suffering,\\" he believes.

B000E97HIA|5.0|Prince is back again and better than ever...bringing us music that made us fall in love with him in the first place!  No song on \\"3121\\" is a dud...indeed from the infectious opening title cut to the old-school ender, \\"Get on the Boat\\"--which features Prince's life-long protege, Sheila E., btw, every track is full of energy, sex appeal, originality and the raw unadulterated funk that was and always will be Prince's signature style.  Cuts like the super-nasty \\"Black Sweat\\" and the rock-infused \\"Fury\\" could very well have been taken from the vaults of his earlier releases-i.e-\\"Purple Rain\\" and \\"Sign of the Times\\").  While neo-hip-hop tracks like the energetic, \\"Love\\" and the slow burning, \\"Incense and Candles\\" will sure to please the now-generation. Musicology was herald as Prince's return to glory, but I'm afraid, that \\"3121\\" without a doubt would have to be that!!!

B000089CJI|5.0|I actually ordered this album by mistake, and it sat in the back seat of my car for over a month before decided to give it a chance.  <br />One word. Amazing. When I heard excerpts from the tracks on the computer, I was discouraged by the electronic/techno undertones that run through the album. However, far from detracting from the sound, they add an electrifying boost and originality that make the album even more appealing. I say this in complete seriousness: this album truly brings my emotions to the surface and at times makes me want to cry, laugh sing, whatever. Ben Gibbard's enchantingly mellow vocals, deep bass, airy duets, and meaningful lyrics, Give Up has it all. I highly recommend this album to anyone and everyone with an open-minded appreciation for music. Give Up will, corny as it sounds, really change your life.
B000AADYYO|4.0|Opeth is a band that is difficult to get into on the first listen. The songs arent particularily catchy, and the length of most of them makes it tough to instantly understand their art. However, when one takes the time to understand this group, I think most people will see that Opeth is much more than just your typical heavy band. GHOST REVERIES is truly a wonderful opportunity for new fans of the band to explore this brand of experimental progressive rock. The music is very cerebral, but while maintaining a quality that makes it both entertaining and enjoyable to hear. Many other artists attempt to do the same, but in many cases the end result is either 1. Random sound-effects, or 2. The songs become undigestible and therefore discardable. Opeth somehow manages to escape both of these vices and consisitently comes out with genuine sonic ingenuity each time out. I definitly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a fresh twist on progressive rock and metal.
B00004RYUA|5.0|Simply outstanding! A real gem of a film. The costume and set designs by Cecil Beaton cannot be surpassed. I never tire of watching the film or listening to the Soundtrack. I spoke to an elderly British expat and he told me that it was quite an accurate portrayal of life in British Edwardian society. Furthermore, he related to me that the film did a great job of conveying what it was like to be poor, cockney and working class in London at that time. In addition, much of the film's cast either lived during or shortly after the film's historical setting. One of the actors, Stanley Holloway, actually served in the Britian's military during World War I when the country was the British Empire. There's probably never been a remake of the film on the big screen because no one one other than the actors who were in that film could pull it off. Not to mention that the film budget in today's dollars would probabaly be horrendously expensive.

0792843584|5.0|Whatever people say about Heaven's Gate, I'd have to say otherwise, that it was GREAT and Outstanding film! I'm really glad that I had the opportunity to see it when it was on the big screen. I will order the DVD as soon as I get a chance.  <br /> <br />Heaven's Gate probably bombed big time at the Box Office because unlike hundreds of films about the Wild West before it, it dispelled any romantic notions of what it was truly like to live during that era. Living in Western America was anything but ideal for the denizens of poor immigrants coming from Europe to the New World. Post Civil War America was a tough, brutal, violent and incredibly racist place where the poor were easy prey for the rich.  If it wasn't Indians who were pushed aside to make way for the new Settlers heading West, then it was the robber barons who exploited the labor of the new immigrants. Not an easy time to live in. As for those who say the film was boring and slow, one has to remember that this was the 19th century, not the 20th. There were no TVs, radios, computers, etc. Life WAS a heck of a lot slower in those days than it is today. If anything, the film did its best to speed up the pace of life back then. <br /> <br />What probably turned a lot of people off, including the critics, is that no one likes to think that their ancestors stole, killed, exploited others, prostituted themselves or  raped. But that's probably what happened. If anything, the film was probably too real for most filmgoers. Plus, Kris Kristofferson and Isabelle Hupert don't exactly portray the most idealistic of characters. There are no perfect heroes or heroines in the film. And that's what Michael Cimino conveyed so well. He reveals a 19th Century America of the Wild West for what it truly was. Watching this film made you feel like you were actually there. I know several people would disagree with this assessment, but that's the way I see it.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|I suppose this was meant to be a charming little nerd love story, but unfortunately, the character seems to be a total moron.<br /><br />Spawned from the bottom of the gene pool, even his relatives are odious creatures plunging the depths of white trash. He befriends a Mexican moron with high hopes, and lucky for him, Napoleon just so happened to have rehearsed a few dance moves with a workout video, which got him the student body president title - I'm not sure I want to know what hypothetically became of that situation.<br /><br />The definition of nerd may be that of a person who is socially awkward, but usually highly intelligent and achieves great success in life in the corporate field, science field, or computer technology; while the 'jocks' who picked on them in high school become some sort of blue-collar simpletons working under them. Unfortunately, this is not the case with this character.  I Am surprised that Napoleon does not attend one of those \\"special needs\\" schools, and it is difficult to surmise what would become of him after graduation - or perhaps his older siblings are a sad indication...

B00000I41J|5.0|There are a few reissues of this absolutely great Cannonball Adderley recording. The first five cuts on all the reissues are the same 5 cuts that make up the original vinyl LP. A few of the reissued CD's have an additional sixth cut. The sixth cut was discovered by Blue Note and initially released in Japan in 1982 and given the name \\"Allison's Uncle\\" because Nat Adderley's daughter was born on the day it was recorded. Further research revealed that the mystery tune is a Hank Jones composition that the pianist recorded as \\"Rangoon\\" with the Gigi Gryce/Donald Byrd Jazz Lab quintet for a Jubilee label in August 1957. Therefore, please be advised that \\"Allison's Uncle\\" and \\"Rangoon\\" and the same exact cut, just with a different name for the same song. I got this info from the Rudy Van Gelder Edition footnotes by Bob Blumenthal. Tidbits like this are very important to me and thought it might be valuable to others as well.

B00003CWL6|5.0|The presentation of this film on DVD was excellent!  You get over 3 hours of supplemental material along with your choice of DTS or Dolby 5.1 surround audio.  All of the studios can take example of how this film was transferred to DVD.  It was a pleasure screening this film on DVD through our new progressive scan home theater system in DTS 5.1 surround.  The print transferred well and is vivid, sharp and clear with the correct aspect ratio.  It truely was like going to my local movie theater.<br /><br />The script was written by Alan Ball of HBO's \\"Six Feet Under\\" fame.  An excellent story of a man coming to terms with his life in middle age and dealing with it in his own way as well as his self-absorbed wife and daughter.  It's the perfect portrayal of American dysfunctional families.  This plot is combined with other subplots that keep you wondering what's going to happen next.  All of this is the perfect storytelling by Ball who is a master of surprise twists along the way.  The script treatment is perfectly presented by Sam Mendes' directional interpretation.  It's no wonder this film captured 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture!<br /><br />Excellent performances by Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari.  Watch for the very notable supporting performances by Chris Cooper and Allison Janney (The West Wing) and the cameos by Scott Bakula and Sam Robards.<br /><br />This is a must have to your DVD collection.
B0002EXH5O|4.0|We shall discuss the whole issue of remaster versus rerecording a little bit later.  First off lets just review Rust In Peace!  The first album with new ex-Shrapnel shredder Marty Friedman, Rust In Peace is more structured and less erratic than So Far, So Good... So What! by a long shot.  One thing is Dave Musataine's newfound sobriety, the other is a group of musician's who actually get along long enough to write some decent metal classics.<br /><br />\\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\\" absolutely f*cking rox!  One of the greatest metal songs ever written and definetly one of Megadeth's best.  \\"Hangar 18\\" is a staple of the group and a rocker.  \\"Take No Prisoners\\" takes us back a little to the Peace Sella era with its ferocity and straight-forward thrashiness.  Beautiful.  \\"Five Magics\\" is middle of the road, still a rocker, but not a kewel as it could be; the same can be said about \\"Poison Was The Cure\\" as well.  The lyrics are a little stupid and that probably taints those two songs. \\"Lucretia\\" is a solid rocker along with \\"Tornado Of Souls\\" & \\"Rust In Peace...Polaris.\\"  \\"Dawn Patrol\\" is a little experimental rap that Mustaine cooks up about the rape of the evironment and it's decent, but nothing special.  Overall, a very, very solid effort for the newly formed Megadeth.  It will only get better from here as we shall soon see with Countdown To Extinction.  Rust In Piece is one of the best Megadeth albums to ever come out.  Period!<br /><br />Now, let's hit the rerecording/remastering issue.  People remember the old version of Rust In Peace and the new version.  Apparently Dave Mustaine had to rerecord the vocals for \\"Lucretia\\" becaust Capitol lost the original vocal tapes.  Hmmm.  The purist in me says to remaster the old stuff so it sounds better but not to f*ck with history and masterpieces.  When ozzy rerecorded parts of Blizzard Of Ozz and Diary Of A Madman I cringed.  Sacriledge!  Blasphemy!  I'm sure the die-hard Megadeth fans feel the same way about Rust In Peace & other Megadeth classics.  The only difference here is that Mustaine is Megadeth and he's the one doing the tampering.  He didn't hire some new musicians to record over original pieces.  That's the difference.  Mustaine is going back and trying to correct the small errors that he never got a chance to fix before.  Is it right?  Decide for yourself.  If you want the original versions, they're still out there.  Either way, Rust In Peace still Rox!  The remastered version has a couple of extra tunes, some demos (yawn) and an unreleased tune called \\"My Creation\\" which was unreleased for a reason, because it's Mega-weak.<br /><br />Dig it!eace & other Megadeth classics.

B0002EXH54|5.0|In 1986, when Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? came out, most of the world was either listening to the new wave techno MTV bands or they were partying with hair-metal bands like Motley Crue and Ratt and Poison and the likes.  Underground metal was starting to make some noise and die-hards were spotted at school wearing t-shirts from bands like Slayer and Exodus and Anthrax and Megadeth and Metallica and such.<br /><br />Born of the vengeance of Dave Mustaine and his willingness to to anything necessary to show up his former bandmates in Metallica, Megadeth was born.  The fastest, thrashiest, most obnoxious speed metal band that ever lived was what Mustaine was going for.  But he wanted to have talent around him, too.  Not only was Megadeth thrashing it up, they were techinically good musicians.  Chris Poland on guitar and Gar Samuelson on drums round out Dave Mustaine and Dave Ellefson and Megadeth head into their second album.<br /><br />\\"Wake Up Dead\\" a Megadeth staple tune and a certified rocker.  The lyrics are a little juvenille now that we can look back, but otherwise a very cool tune.  \\"The Conjuring\\" musically stunning, lyrically trying to be evil in the Mercyful Fate Satan-is-good kind of sense, except he's asking us to cojure Dave Mustaine instead of Lucifer.  Kinda freaky cool.  \\"Peace Sells\\" one of the greatest metal tunes ever written and of course Megadeth's most recognized tune.  The bass line was the music for MTV news forever.  Great song!  Very anti-establishment!  Sit up and notice me!  This was Megadeth extreme!  \\"Devils Island\\" a hard rocking tune based on the classic novel Papillon, showed us Mustaine was literate as well as pissed off.  Great.  \\"Good Mourning/Black Friday\\"  another musical stunner with murderous, I-will-cut-you-down lyrics, almost feels like a leftover from Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good!  Metal, but kinda regressive.  \\"Bad Omen\\"  starts off like Good Mourning/Black Friday, a little eerie.  Truns into a thrash-metal burner.  Not really a memorable tune, missing some hooks.  \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" probably the most straight-forward rock tune, a cover, of course.  \\"My Last Words\\"  same intro as Good Mourning & Bad Omen?  Soundz a little familiar.  All out thrash metal.<br /><br />Overall, Peace Sells... wil always be remembered as one of the pioneering albums of Thrash & Speed Metal.  Truly great!  A classic.

B000E994KE|5.0|i've been listening to Amorphis for a long time, at least 7 years. I'm writing this review for two reasons. one, this album is very well written, the new singer is awesome, and the melodies are some of the most memorable Amorphis have written on par with classics such as Black Winter Day, Against Widows, and weeper on the shore. The second, and main reason i am writing this is i thought their last album Far from the sun was terrible, and eclipse is a million times better. i loved elegy and black winter day and thought albums like tuonela and am universum were good but not true to amorphis. With eclipse Amorphis blend everything they are including death vocals, clean vocals, shouting vocals, sick guitar riffs, atmospheric keyboards, and on point drumming. This album is for anyone who likes great music and amorphis fans who liked elegy and aren't afraid to listen to amorphis with new and improved vocals. Eclipse is a fantastic album, and are what Amorphis needed to put them back into the game.
B0002EXH40|5.0|Some people viewed the departure of Megadeth's roots in Speed/Thrash Metal as a sign of selling out much in the same way they viewed Metallica's rise to success.  Megadeth invented Thrash along with Anthrax, Metallica & Slayer and they abandoned it!  We should get the rope, right?  No.  Just like Metallica, Megadeth started to finally grow up.  Do you want to sit around and listen to a bunch of fifty year-old millionaires bitching about the establishment and the failures of society and blah-de-blah?  Do you?  You can if you want, but youthful anger is hard to maintain, especially when you are moderately to staggeringly rich.  Sorry to tell you this, but all bands, and I say ALL bands, are in the music business to sell albums.  That's where the money is.  Chicks?  Maybe.  Creative fusion.  Certainly.  Megadeth is no different.  Mustaine is no longer shooting heroin and going on drinking binges, he's married with children.  People change.  So do their musical tastes.  Is Youthanasia un-metal.  F*ck no!  It still rocks as hard as anything out here.<br /><br />\\"Reckoning Day\\" Metal, brutal, kick-you-in-the-teeth.  A great hate-my-old-girlfriend/ex-wife song.  A classic.  \\"Train Of Consequences\\" another certified rocker.  Great lyrics and great riffs.  \\"Addicted To Chaos\\" a slower, more moody outing.  Still very kewel.  Lyrically deep.  Megadeth has grown up indeed.  \\"A Tout Le Monde\\"  one of Mustaine's greatest songs.  There's feeling in there, as opposed to just shredding your face off with a non-sensical diatribe to anger and misery.  Greatness!  \\"Elysian Fields\\" on of my all-time favorites.  This is a great f*cking song!  What a hook.  Great lyrics.  Solid.  \\"The Killing Road\\"  where Motley Crue and Bon Jovi were writing songs about the road in the cowboy/rebel Bob Seger sense, Megadeth comes out with the truth about being on the road.  Kewel.  \\"Blood Of Heroes\\" another favorite of mine.  There is something very catchy about this tune.  A straight-forward riff and cool lyrics, I don't know why, but I love it!  \\"Family Tree\\"  a great song about abuse.  Thinking man's metal.

B000002BBY|5.0|\\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\" is rock and roll stripped down worse than a porn star at prom. It's in your face and blurry, a collection of sounds and rhythms so rapidly spit, they knock you in your face, breathless en route to a jazzed up headache.  <br /> <br />The disk has songs that cry out to you - \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" - tunes that ride a high - \\"Roll With It\\" - as well as a merge of the most influential genres music chucked out since it was a toddler in Elvis' \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\".   <br /> <br />Oasis, rolling through the high stylings of MOD, their resemblance uncanny with folded shirts and a soul made out of rubber, release a dance pop riot, and make it fight tediously with sore throat grunge.   <br /> <br />Call them slaves to the Beatles, even back ally copy cats of the great Brit-pop movement, but do so with hypocrisy. Oasis have attached themselves to music that fought against the administration. They've recreated the Summer of Love, and I say, here, here to such a concept. With \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\", Oasis have created a pot smoking disco ball, with Noel blending in styles so different they blush when together.   <br /> <br />When Noel sat down and wrote it, he may not have been thinking about the impact it was going to have in the `95, \\"oh, we're in the nineties now\\", society. He may not have thought his cough ups about pop culture hysterectomies would matter. How wrong he was, because Oasis didn't just define a generation, it nailed it down with a hammer, taking the living breath out of the mainstream sounds of grunge. Irony intended every bit.   <br /> <br />Noel keeps an attitude about him that is rough and innocent, his voice flustering as he ponders to either hit the notes, or let the notes hit him first. By the time he gets to \\"Champaign Supernova\\", you find yourself pondering how you are able to dance to raw sound. Emotions are chopped up and delivered in liquor shots as \\"Morning Glory\\" rolls through \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Some Might Say\\" and \\"Hey Now!\\".   <br /> <br />It's an album that doesn't beg to be recited. It doesn't want you to classify it, and in no way does it want to be put up on a pedestal. It's just a wicked nice piece of non fiction, from a band that seemed to carry the world on their British backs during its release.  <br /> <br />There are some rock and roll discs that hold on to listeners through lowly punch lines, between a muddled mess of off beats and boring tunes. \\"Morning Glory\\" is all a muddled mess, but the hottest sounding and looking mess on the shelves of HMV.   <br /> <br />And this dirty mess infects the listener with tunes that seem to come out of the planet.. <br /> <br />Oasis performs \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\" like it is a show on Broadway, because after the first track, every other has a life by itself. The actors, each taking on a personality for the play, hurry throughout the acts, picking away at the un-expecting audience.  <br /> <br />Oasis is not standing out in the rain, asking to be Shakespearean.. Most of the rock and roll on the market - oh, pardon me, sire, most of the \\"rock\\" on the market - is rubbish, over hyped, \\"next big thing\\" retaliation to our society's need for Glamour and People's magazines. They is nothing glamorous about Liam singing about booze, Noel bopping his head in tune and Paul Arthurs , Paul McGuigan and Alan White rocking out to the steady passed rock. Here's to raw sound.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|After hitting and missing over the past eight years, Dave Mustaine & Co. finally hit paydirt with Countdown To Extinction.  This is where Megadeth finally stepped out of Metallica's long shadow and made a name for themselves with some seriously killer metal.<br /><br />\\"Skin O My Teeth\\" great album opener.  One of my favorite Megadeth tunes and a live staple for years.  All out in-your-face metal.  Classic.  \\"Symphony Of Destruction\\" another great Megadeth classic and one of the greatest metal songs ever written.  The riff in Symphony is so easy and yet so f*cking metal its beautiful.  Dark and moody and rocking!  Awesome!  \\"Architecture Of Aggression\\" another blasting metal song.  Great and catchy and filled with metal, here we learn about politics ala Dave Mustaine.  Wicked good.  \\"Foreclosure Of A Dream\\" a deep, tragic look at the death of the American Dream.  Got the famous \\"Read My Lips\\" George Bush speech in there.  One of the first songs of many that Dave uses speeches and news reports, etc... to hammer his point home.  Inventive, but might become a little tedious after a decade or so.  \\"Sweating Bullets\\"  another Megadeth classic.  I can remeber hearing this when it first came out and thinking, jeez, that guy's annoying.  Megadeth is definitely an acquired taste.  \\"This Was My Life\\"  solid.  Missing something, but still solid.  \\"Countdown To Extinction\\"  yet another classic.  Mustaine kicked out all the jams on this album.  A distinct commentary on the annihilation of innocent animals.  Grim and poignant.  Mustaine has a way of making you feel like an assh*le.  \\"High Speed Dirt\\" & \\"Psychotron\\"  if Countdown can be said to contain filler, then these two songs are it.  But this is above any normal metal filler.  This is filler deluxe, because it is still pretty good.  Something missing in these two tunes, but still something far above the usual level of mediocre songs.  \\"Captive Honor\\"  at first listen you are taken back a few years to So Far, So Good... and the lame song that is \\"502\\" with the tongue-in-cheek courtroom trial commentary going on.  You think, oh no, not again, and then \\"Captive Honor\\" really starts and you're hooked on it because it rocks.  Where \\"502\\" was lame, \\"Captive Honor\\" succeeds.  \\"Ashes In Your Mouth\\"  a great underrated song.  \\"Ashes\\" tends to get overlooked because it is the last song on the disc, but it absolutely rocks!<br /><br />The remeastered version gives us some demos (yawn) and the unreleased tune \\"Crown Of Worms\\" which is pretty good for a b-side, soundtrack kinda tune.<br /><br />Overall, Countdown To Extinction is the perfection of Megadeth.  The will never be better than this...sadly.  But every band has to have its peak, and here it is.  Does every band have it's perfect album?  No way, that is rare, but Countdown provides Megadeth their perfect album.  Great from start to finish and where the gloss wears thin, it's not enough to tarnish the rest of the effort.  One of the greatest Heavy Metal albums of all time and one of my all-time favorites.  This is what put Megadeth aside from all the mediocre metal bands of this era.<br /><br />Dig it!the lame song that is \\"502\\" with the tongue-in-cheek courtroom trial commentary going on.

B00005JNTX|4.0|Cool.  There's just no other way to describe \\"Sin City\\".  From beginning to end, it was just COOL. I've read the comics and the movie is those pictures come alive and moving. What can I say?  It's just so ... so ... so COOL!!!!
B0007OCG56|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I loved the characters and thought that the movie captured perfectly some of the relationship pitfalls that exist between family members and employer/employees.    Tea Leone is perfectly scary as the obsessive-compulsive, competative, spoiled wife who does not have a warm relationship with anyone in the movie, including her husband.  She has very little to do with her own children, but becomes obsessed with her housekeepers daughter because she is so beautiful.  There is a telling scene where she purchases her daughter Bernice bags of new clothing.  Bernice is elated until she realizes that all of the clothes are too small and her mother tells her that they'll all fit when she loses a little weight.    Adam Sandler is a great surprise here in a dramatic, rather than comedic, role as a chef/restauranteur.  He has complicated employee relationships (a sous chef who wants part ownership in the restaurant, an agressive manager who wants to change the feeling of the restaurant) and home relationships.  When Flor arrives he is taken by her but this doesn't get too complicated until his wife insists that Flor and her daughter move into the Malibu summer house with them.    Flor is a very attentive and focused mother.  She takes the job with the Clasky's because she wants more time in the evenings with her daughter and needs to make more money.  This is her first move out of the hispanic community she has enjoyed since moving to the U.S.  She resists the Clasky's efforts to \\"help\\" her daughter and this becomes a full out war of wills between her and Mrs. Clasky, though Mr. Clasky un-wittingly puts himself into it as well.  Flor is a determined character, probably the best one in the film, she is a fierce mother and seems to have her priorities intact.    The relationship between Flor and Mr. Clasky is, I thought, one of the most natural in the movie.  Of course he is attracted to the beautiful maid but as the movie goes on you findthat they appreciate each other for their ideals, not thier looks.  In the end the relationship goes nowhere, because it shouldn't and they are both wise enough to know that.  In contrast, Mrs. Clasky is carrying on with her real estate agent and thinks all will be forgiven.     Cloris Leachman is wonderful as Mrs. Clasky's live in mother.  She provides most of the comic releif in this movie.    This movie is not making a serious racial statement like Crash and it's not funny like some of Sandler's other films but it is an entertaining dramatic film that says a lot about family.
B000006IUQ|5.0|If you like stories having to do with power and elemental forces at odds with with society and civilization, o.k. -- but if you want to see a story with Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin at odds with each other, man: you can't do no better, choo!
B000BEZQ18|4.0|If you've seen this movie and were left with that melancholy sadness from it, this soundtrack is the perfect thing to bring all that lonely longing back for you once you've left the theater.
B00000I8UK|4.0|Really the thing that gets me is not Dolphy's playing at all.  It's Bobby Hutcherson's.  He is a master on this album, proving solo after solo that his taste is something to be reckoned with. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the vibraphones, and want to hear them used the exact opposite of the way that the Modern Jazz Quartet used them, grab your keys, walk out of your door, lock your door, walk down the path in front of your house, out of your front yard, shutting the small latch on your gate, get in your car and go to a music store.  Once there, head to the jazz section and get this album. <br /> <br />Or, you know, click BUY. <br /> <br />Either way.  It'll work.
0393327655|3.0|I found the book to be interesting and it brought to light many compelling arguments but it also felt like a book written with a narcissistic attempt at impressing the authors intellectual peers.  Whenever possible the author used uncommon words that he must know the average reader wouldn't know, in an attempt at sounding overly intellectual.  Other than that, a good read with somewhat convincing arguments and added but didn't define my overall understanding of the subject matter.
B00005614M|5.0|Kind of Blue is an infinitely more appealing album for fans of jazz small-groups and improvisation.  That's why I'd suggest that if you have to spend your money on ONE Miles album, you go buy \\"Kind of Blue\\". <br /> <br />But once you understand \\"Kind of Blue\\", and get the concept that Miles was aiming for with that album, go explore what he was doing before he got there.  And start here. <br /> <br />This album is the sound of jazz that I fell in love with at age 14, after listening to the likes of Tommy Dorsey and Frank Sinatra for years and years.  I didn't even know \\"Kind of Blue\\" existed at that time, but I loved the soft sounds this album was throwing on my young ears. <br /> <br />What I didn't realize at the time was how harmonically complex and staggeringly innovative this album is/was.  Miles plays with a nonet, uses a tuba for a few baselines, strips jazz of its aggressiveness, and STILL manages to make an album that Swings with genuine purpose. <br /> <br />This is a soft album that is not a soft album.  This is a soft album that is accessible, sure.  But it has got something underneat its softness: soul.
B000006IUQ|5.0|\\"Charles here is a billionaire. You know what happens when you misplace one?\\"<br /><br />Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins are the perfect duo in this survival of the fitest wild adventure. Some parts are graphic but they are ultimately tied together with a courage to survive. Hopkins, playing charles, is the brain of the trio of survivor's of a small plane crash when they got detoured on a photo shoot.<br /><br />Watch as Anthony carefully stresses to the others that they must never give up and that they should always keep thinking of their options. It's a smart gimmick, to be an optimist when you're lost out in the wilderness.<br /><br />The enemy of this film is, not only nature and the elements, but also a grizzly bear that is hungry for blood.<br /><br />It's sort of like CASTAWAY but with way more dialogue and way more smart thinking. Charles says at the begining of the film that he has all this knowledge and could never put it to good use but when they are atranded in the wilderness he is the main leader and a perfect guide to get them saved and rescued.<br /><br />Filled with action, horror, suspense, and survival. This is one really good gritty survival movie. It takes you to the edge.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00000IL26|5.0|Groove. Funk.  Soul.  Ain't got nothin' on Morgan. <br /> <br />His solo on \\"The Sidewinder,\\" in particular the second chorus, is worth the price of admission for this album.  Joe Henderson is a monster on sax, and the album just grooves from first track to last.  The album feels a bit repedetive with the alternate take of \\"Totem Pole\\" thrown on the end, but it's a good take so I guess it's worth listening to. <br /> <br />Forget the fakers, pick up the real deal.
B000E97HIA|4.0|Prince's new album is very good. I can't say it's excellent, but it definitly brings it back to his roots.  If you are looking for that old Prince feel, than this is an album for you.  He hasn't broken any new ground and I don't think he is planning on breaking any more new ground than he already has. This is a solid album.  You definitly need to give it several listens to fully appreciate it.  Overall, it is typical Prince but in a good way.
B000002ADT|5.0|Maybe.  If you don't own this yet, I suggest you get it. I went out and bought this record for a coworker of mine a few days ago.  He is a middle-aged musician who has been playing guitar for years and years. <br /> <br />He came up to me the other day and said that listening to this album had changed his way of approaching the blues in one night. <br /> <br />Worth it for Bill Evan's superb liner notes if for no other reason, Kind of Blue is worth checking out no matter HOW long you've been playing or listening to music.
B000E1155E|4.0|This band has gotten so much hype from the UK that I thought they were going to be the next big thing.  It was said that they would be bigger than when Oasis first came out but I don't see that at all.  They're more like a Stone Roses, a very good album and will probably never be heard again.  That may be harsh to say but it is what it is.  Needless to say, I think it is a great album. By all means, I enjoy this album very much but I guess I am disappointed because I had HIGH expectations.
B00004VWAF|3.0|Like everything new, this album takes a bit of getting used to.  The first time I heard it, I hated it.  The second time I heard it, I hated it less.  Now, it's one of those albums that I can put on once in a while when I'm \\"in the mood.\\" <br /> <br />People are quick to praise this album as being a precursor to techno and trance.  I would agree: it's definitely light years ahead of its time.  But it's certainly not as beautiful as \\"In a Silent Way\\" or as adventurous as \\"Bitches Brew\\". <br /> <br />I think, like everything new that Miles was experimenting with, this album doesn't quite settle in or feel comfortable with itself.  And me, I haven't ever quite felt comfortable with it.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|Reviewers may pooh-pooh the marked Hollywood glibness to its narrative, or the minor liberties it takes with factual minitiae, but Lord of War is no mean feat. It soars high above those gripes with a compelling tale well told, some top-notch acting, and a gripping script peppered with a million rent-a-quotes.<br /><br />The theme had me at Hello: a biopic of a gunrunner's meteoric rise to the top of the global arms race, and his inevitable slide thereof, although its final suit is not buttoned quite so neatly. The sinister trade of glocks and AK-47s is often ignored by popular media in favor of seemingly bigger pies like air force jets and nuclear scuds, but as a matter of fact these little handheld weapons account for more bloodbaths around the world than all other alternatives combined.<br /><br />The little revolutions they foster in unglamoruous corners of the world such as the Balkans or northern Africa are seldom televized, so a film so palatable and entertaining serves a very respectable purpose despite playing on the fringes of moral preachiness. In that sense, its punches may sometimes be predictable, but why not -- given the brutality of the world it depicts, it is all eminently forgiveable. A clever undertone of timely black comedy only helps matters along.<br /><br />You know you have seen something special if you ruminate on it for days afterward, and this chilling, provocative, enlightening production causes that in spades. Sure-shot nomination for Cage come Oscar time. A must-watch for everyone, but a must-own for the discerning.
B00000ADG2|5.0|In 2006, eight years after it was released, this album still sounds as fresh and exciting as ever.  That means one thing: this album is full of considerable juice. <br /> <br />It flows through every track: an energy -- happy, sad, thoughtful, joyous, grateful, contemplative... there is something about this album that can strike a chord in anyone. <br /> <br />Before Kanye blew up, before Alisha Keys made the \\"lady on the piano\\" cool, before OutKast made it cool to do experimental rap albums, before Beyonce made people notice the beauty of a black woman singer... there was Lauryn Hill.  And man, her voice is one that will stand out in its uniqueness for generation. <br /> <br />Forget the titles \\"MC\\" or \\"singer\\".  For once, the title \\"artist\\" seems to fit better.
0684824906|4.0|This book offers a unique perspective on Lincoln, not an easy task given how much has been written about him.  I did feel the book was stronger in the earlier sections, when the principal characters actually were rivals, than later when they came together in one Administration.  <br /> The book demonstrates time and again how Lincoln's magnamity toward his rivals so often ended up working to his advantage.  <br /> Once the team is in place, Lincoln comes to dominate the book. Not a bad thing, in my view, but the second half of the book is not much different than a standard presidential biography. <br /> Granted Doris Kearns Goodwin is not a military historian, but during the sections of the book that covered the war, I often felt I was somehow out of place. It was one thing to be at the White House when Lincoln, on his first day as president, receives a letter from the Fort Sumter garrison saying we can't hold out much longer. But by the time the canons were roaring at Shiloh and Gettysburg, I felt constrained waiting at the Telegraph office for news.   <br /> What a remarkable stroke of luck for our nation that at such a critical time in our history the democratic system somehow coughed up one of the few bona fide geniuses to ever hold the office.  <br /> And what an awful event was his assassination. It is hard not to see it as the great tragedy of 19th century America. Lincoln may been better suited to lead the country through Reconstruction than war. While his skills as a wartime president were for the most part developed by \\"on the job training\\", the job he seems to have been born for was that of a mediator.  <br />
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Buble is the man in this cd/dvd combo.  I was weary of the live cd format but he does an AMAZING job, not too much talk or excessive clapping inbetween.  Overall- a MUST buy for any Buble' fans and any swing or classic fans.
B00005JJX8|5.0|I have yet to see a bad Cary Grant movie.  I remember watching this on ABC, or CBS late one Saturday nite as a young man.  It was very exciting plot.  So when I saw it in DVD and at a great price, I had to have it in my collection.  The fact that you can put subtitles to understand every word makes the movie even better.  It is still a great movie.  You can't go wrong with this price and this quality acting.  Grant has grace...and he plays opposite a Grace...Kelly that is.  Ha!
0380789019|5.0|It's nearly two a.m. in the morning where i am, and i've just finished reading this novel. I have to say, i've never read anything quite like this book. Adventure pretty much sums it all up, in one word. Hell, reading it was like living a real adventure, only in my mind, my imagination. Which is, of course, where the best and most perfect of adventures usually take place. Strange and weird and fanstastic. And i loved every second of it.  I won't say what the book is about, but i will say that if you like grand adventure and fantasy, then give this excellent book a try. You'll probably love it as much as i did. Or perhaps, if it is at all possible, a bit more. <br /> <br />Oh, and beware of doors. Or, mebbe, look for them. <br /> <br />Hawksmoor...From The Bleed.
B000005H3Y|5.0|This is without question a desert-island disc for me. Not just one of Dexter's best, but one of the best jazz albums, period.  Dexter is a bottomless resevoir of ideas, all seamlessly, brilliantly strung together in that languid, big-sound style of his. He seems so relaxed but this disc swings HARD.  Please give recognition to drummer Billy Higgins, whose understated and tasteful style is a big factor in this disc's swing quotient.  He always plays the right thing at the right time and scupulously complements the rest of the band.  His versatily was amazing too--just think, he also played with Ornette Coleman! <br /> <br />And the ballads, they're lush and poignant. There isn't a soul out there, diehard jazz fan or jazz neophyte, who won't like this disc. It's virtuosic and inviting, sensuous and intelligent, addictive, joyous, and hard-swinging.  You can't go wrong with it.
1878424319|5.0|The agreements of Don Miguel Ruiz and the Toltecs can begin to change your life the instant you read them, yet the more you study, the deeper you can go with these ideas.  A great book.
B000002J03|5.0|Whole Lotta Love- Unbelievable riff. Sounds completely different from the blues-heavy first album (it cranks up the electric guitar). 10/10 <br />What Is and What Should Never Be- Great song that has a soft-loud dynamic. I enjoy the live version on How the West Was Won better, though. 10/10 <br />The Lemon Song- Zep's most underappreciated song. Great riff and I love when the song \\"takes it down low\\". 9/10 <br />Thank You- Worst song on the album. Many people like it, but no matter how many times I try, I just can't get into the song. 5/10 <br />Heartbreaker- Awesome. My favorite Zep song. The riff is awesome and the solo is unbelievable. 10/10 <br />Living Loving Maid- Pretty good. Sounds different from the rest of the album. Hit song in the 60's because it's kind of a hippie song. 7/10 <br />Ramble On- Great song.It should be on the Early Days album, but for some reason it was left out. 10/10 <br />Moby Dick- Hey, I like this song. The riff is great, it's just that a drum solo isn't as great a listen as a guitar. Bonham does show off his talents, though. 8/10 <br />Bring It on Home- Plant uses a cool Southern accent at the beginning before turning into a fast-paced song. 9/10
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is so good that it is almost difficult to stand, realizing that the imbeciles at FOX cancelled it after only nine episodes.  Well, at least you get to watch the unaired episodes if you buy the DVD set.  Just about everything on this TV show was perfect--the acting, sets, costumes, special effects, and especially the writing.  It is almost incomprehensible how good, entertaining, witty, funny (you pick your own adjective) the writing and art direction on this show are.  And the music!

B000EGDC14|4.0|Although Goldfrapp makes catchy and sexy disco/electronica music she's too unique to get airtime on MTV so this CD/DVD set is a great chance to see her perform.The DVD features videos for the best songs on the CD and  a live concert performance of a song that has more psychadelic light effects than a Pink Floyd concert.Even if you've never bought a Goldfrapp cd before chances are you know her music.Black Cherry's Strict Machine was in Nintendo commercials and Tiptoe was used by Diet Coke.In Supernature the bouncy opener OOH LA LA is already being used by Diet Coke,the song itself is a terrific kickoff to an album of sexy slinky music with great beats.Slower songs on the album have nice cinematic music that brings to mind her first album Felt Mountain.But while Felt Mountain wasn't to all tastes Supernature has something for everybody.For some reason Goldfrapp makes me think of Blondie and I hope one day she becomes that popular.NO. 1 is the album's standout song but other songs are also addictive fun in their own ways.

B00005QAPH|5.0|This movie is about as tiring and confused as the narrator/protagonist. Just like him we know his project is doomed, but we can't do anything about it until he does something about it, so we plod along with him and hope that maybe someone else will work it out for him.<br /><br />It's a very intimidating film, I think even moreso for filmmakers. It represents just the fear they have, where they want to express something but have no idea how to do it, so try to pass off a bunch of vague and insubstantial images as a plot for a while until other people start getting serious about what's needed to be put in it to make it actually a film. In that way it's a lot like Adaptation, except Adaptation makes it colorful and zany in a twisted way while this makes it pretty dark and brooding. Both films are brilliant, if for no other reason in that I can't believe it actually worked out.<br /><br />In fact, one thing that's amazing about this film is that I didn't feel like I was watching Fellini (like how in Adaptation I felt I was watching Charlie Kaufman). Despite the inherent self-reflexiveness of having a movie about movies, this one didn't seem to bring attention to the camera or exposition at all, instead making the \\"movie within a movie\\" moments a product of the antihero's film-centric imagination (how his dreams are filled with set pieces, rigid cutting, and silent, visual aura while the real moments in the film are filled with sound, other people moving, longer, more flowing takes, and less dance numbers.) It also is very interesting to follow the supporting characters, how they all seem to have wives you never see and mistresses you see all the time, how they all do their thing without knowing what they're supposed to do, all because that's all they know how to do, and how they invest themselves with the director and he just pushes them aside. Then with all the introductions to women who want parts, the whole melange of faces and bodies all trying to get something out of nothing... it's a very exhausting film.<br /><br />But that's what it's trying to express, so it's amazing. I love the obvious and yet completely profound images of stuff like \\"The set built on sand\\" and \\"I need to include everything to express nothing.\\" Good stuff.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBout of nothing... it's a very exhausting film. <br /> <br />But that's what it's trying to express, so it's amazing.

6301969294|5.0|Regardless of whether you've read the Ayn Rand book by the same name, you can easily follow and enjoy FOUNTAINHEAD.<br /><br />A black and white 1949 film that on the surface is about a modern architect, a newspaper writer/socialite and their tortured love for each other, FOUNTAINHEAD is actually a dramatization of Rand's controversial objectivist philosophy that promotes individual rights.<br /><br />That, however, is not what makes this a highly recommended film.  What makes FOUNTAINHEAD great are the overly dramatic film noirish scenes where ice princess and newspaper gal about town, Dominique Francon (played by Patricia Neal) rattles off long monologues that leave the viewer and innovative architect Howard Rourke (played by Gary Cooper) charmed.<br /><br />Plus the film is just gorgeous.  The scenes and locations are indescribably beautiful, particularly the party celebrating the opening of the Enwright House.  That is one breath-takingly stunning apartment and yet all the stylish people floating through it have looks of horror on their faces.  \\"It just isn't homey,\\" one snobby lady notes as she searches for the neoclassical embellishments she's more familiar with.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite character is Gale Wynand, Dominique's husband and the owner of the Banner, the city's scandal-obsessed tabloid newspaper.  A self made man, Gale hires Rourke to build a country home as a testament to his love for icy, idealist wife.  No matter how many times I see this film I will never grow tired of the monologue Wynand offers to explain the \\"unspeakable struggle\\" that brought him from destitute poverty growing up in New York's Hell's Kitchen to fabulous wealth.<br /><br />Two other characters are worth noting here.  One is Ellsworth Toohey, the power-obsessed architecture columnist, who uses his pulpit to control and manipulate public opinions and the minds of weak architects like Peter Keating.  An architecture school contemporary of Howard Rourke, Keating is Rourke's polar opposite philosophically.  A follower, who will literally build anything someone will pay for, Keating lacks the soul and vision that makes Rourke such a compelling masculine ideal.<br /><br />I could go on and on writing about this fantastic film but I will restrain myself.  Still I will say if you like the 1940s, film noir, gorgeous design, lady-like clothing and the good old days when men were men and women were stylish, prim and complicated, rent the FOUNTAINHEAD.  It's a gem.<br /><br />If you get disturbed when films do not follow precisely the books they are based on, this will could drive you crazy.<br /><br />- Regina McMenaminis Rourke's polar opposite philosophically.

B000002VCQ|5.0|The first eponymous album that is \\"Whitney Houston\\" is the beginning of a legend. This album was a definite showcase of a still very young, very gifted, fresh face beauty who just arrived on the scene. It was the green light for a new genre of music for contemporary r&b balladeers with divaesque standards, such as the likes of copycats, Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton, and even dirrty little Christina Aguillera. Whitney was the original. This album, carefully tailored to her voice, was, in a nutshell, safe in many ways. With only a few workouts, such as the \\"Greatest Love of All\\" and \\"All At Once\\", the rest of the album was pretty much sapped with early eighties synthesized pop and playfull, teeny lyrics. Nevertheless, the formula obviously worked, spinning three number one hits; the sultry, slick, Grammy award winning, \\"Saving All My Love for You\\", the bouncy and effervescent \\"How Will I Know\\", and of course the George Benson cover of her eighties anthem \\"The Greatest Love of All.\\" However sheltered the album may have seemed, Whitney was giving us a sneak peak into what she could (and would)later offer. Teasing us with cooing runs and licks, and slipping her sexuality in videos and performances, Whitney was downplaying her true talent, (and inner diva), in truly purest form of modesty.  <br />And just like Mariah and Christina, Whitney would later burnish that \\"good girl\\" image into a gritty and more confident performer, no matter what tabloid weekly had to comment on. But for her first album, you simply have Whitney at the core of her potential. The album is truly one of my favorites, not just for the hits, but more because of the naturalness that it offers. As Clive Davis mentioned on the Merv Griffin show about his protege, \\"you either have it or you don't have it, and she's got it!\\" And she has truly been getting us ever since.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|I went to see this film in the theater. I was so overwhelmed by the beauty of this film. Ang Lee brought a simple story and made a romantic,sad,touching film. Heath and Jake were so convincing that you forget they are actors. Michelle Williams is an actress to watch in the future. After years on Dawsons Creek. She has found a place in film history. I can't wait for this film to come out on DVD. In my eyes, Brokeback has won Best Picture.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|If your a fan of South Park, and not easily shocked you will love this movie.  It has all the little hidden treats that SP has plus more.  A Sex scene that will leave you rolled up on the floor hurting because you have laughed so much.
B00005K3OT|1.0|This movie was alright, but I wasn't really blown away by it as much as I hoped. At times it got extremely boring, and I was a bit irritated at the continuous snobby, bitchy look of the actresses. Also, i thought this movie was just too long. I don't mind a movie being 2 hours, but not if most of the movie could have easily been at least an hour and 45 minutes. But oh well, obviously many reviewers found something to like in this movie, but I didn't. Yes, it's a sweet and seductive treat of a film, but nothing to brag about.
B000E41MS6|5.0|What can you say about Doctor Who?  It deserves it's place alongside the likes of \\"Star Trek,\\" \\"Star Wars\\" and others as among the best Sci-Fi stories ever written about or put to film. Christopher Eccleston is great as the Doctor, doing justice to all those before him who portrayed the wandering Time Lord.   Even more so because of what his Doctor has gone through as we see him throughout this new version. This Doctor is experiencing the burden of survivor's guilt over what occurred in the Time War. <br /> <br />No doubt that the Doctor and his new assistant Rose have feelings toward each other throughout the series, culminating with what happens in \\"The Parting of the Ways.\\"  For one of the few times in the overall history of the series, the Doctor has a partner in Rose that he opens up to without fear of being rejected. <br /> <br />Best thing about the return of Doctor Who? An updated version of one the eeriest (and best) opening themes in TV history.  Back to that classic theme with a more modern feel, but it doesn't take away the feeling of a viewer that you're about to embark on something scary and amazing at the same time.
B00005JOE8|4.0|I've never read the graphic novel on which James McTeigue's \\"V for Vendetta\\" is based, but together with the late cinematographer Adrian Biddle, McTeigue certainly makes it unforgettable on the visual level. A sort of \\"1984\\" crossed with \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" and \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" (the last of which is a major motif in the movie), \\"V for Vendetta\\" is the often gripping tale of a masked avenger wreaking havoc on the leaders of a brutal, neo-Fascist totalitarian regime in mid-21st Century England. Murderously intolerant of anyone who isn't a straight, fundamentalist Christian right-winger, the dystopia of \\"V for Vendetta\\" has parallels to those created in \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" and \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" as well as some uncomfortable parallels to political and social realities in present-day England and America. McTeigue gleefully ransacks images from art, literature, theater and cinema to create a film that is never boring and often compelling, even when--particularly toward the end--its story doesn't make a lot of sense. The Wachowski Brothers' script is less interested in creating a cogent rationale and timeline for the story than in creating opportunities for making things fall down go boom; the final scenes, though visually brilliant, pose more questions than they answer. (Sure, the brothers are portraying a society in chaos, but the screenplay itself can't be chaotic.) It's a big help that the supporting players are some of the greatest talents in British Rep. Actors such as John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Rupert Graves, Stephen Fry, Tim Pigott-Smith, John Standing and Sinead Cusack play their roles with absolute conviction, adding immeasurably to the film's impact. As the masked avenger, Hugo Weaving works wonders with his body and voice, but can only partially overcome the handicap of the smirking, immobile Guy Fawkes mask he is forced to wear throughout the movie. As the young woman who becomes the avenger's helpmate and confidante, Natalie Portman is not as good as she was in \\"Closer\\" (a movie pretty much not worth seeing except for her), but vastly better than she was as Princess Padme in the \\"Star Wars\\" movies. In all, \\"V for Vendetta\\" is an entertaining if not totally satisfactory entry in the action-comic book movie genre.good as she was in \\"Closer\\" (a movie pretty much not worth seeing except for her), but vastly better than she was as Princess Padme in the \\"Star Wars\\" movies.

B00080ZG10|2.0|I had to make myself finish watching this movie.  I don't know how this move got all the awards that it did.  I guess I am just not into building airplanes.  I will say that I thought Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job as always, but he was about all that I enjoyed.  Maybe this movie is more for men???
0425205061|5.0|Jack Reacher is one of my favorite characters. I've read all of Lee Child's books and enjoyed each one. Killing Floor is a very dark, disturbing story, filled with some of the most brutal images I've ever read in a murder/mystery. That's not to say that the story isn't any good. It's very good. I just believe that readers need to be aware that there is a tremendous amount of violence in this volume. Some \\"politically correct\\" thinking individuals should probably not read this tome--it might offend you to your core--and you might suffer a debilitating medical condition. <br />Otherwise, another great Jack Reacher novel.

When you have two actors as great as Brad and Angelina, a movie should not possibly be able to go wrong but this one did.  If we could talk to Brad Pitt, he would probably say he is ashamed of this and to please forget he was ever in this movie.  Save your money.

B00000AFGM|5.0|Released in the fall of 1998, this album took many fans by surprise. \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" was a dark, brutal, heavy album, while on \\"Mechanical Animals\\" he changed up the sound quite a bit. This is evident from the very start of the album, kicking off with the awesome \\"Great Big White World\\"(which also happens to be my favorite Manson song of all-time). \\"The Dope Show\\", one of the band's biggest hit singles to date, also displays a new (and great) sound. \\"Rock Is Dead\\" is definitely one of the heaviest songs here, pretty much the only song that sounds like something that could have been on ACS; it is also one of my favorites. The album is good from start to finish, there are really no tracks that you even have to skip over. It ends with the classic \\"Coma White\\", their best album closer to this day. This is proof that a band can change their sound and still remain awesome. If you're a Manson fan, go pick this one up.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|I've a confession to make - I'm in this movie as an extra. I'm one of the out of focus musicians on the bandstand in the Central Park scene. (I spent a week of nights freezing my butt off in a park in Schenectady while they filmed it.) That out of the way, I'd like to make some comments.<br /><br />  This movie was not as well received as the 60's version. (It's been years since I saw that one, so I can't really compare.) There are several reasons. One is the problem with turning the story into a movie.<br /><br />  The original HG Wells epic isn't really a story of any great character depth. The Time Traveler goes into the future, discovers things haven't really worked out for the human race and after some narrow escapes, comes back to tell a few friends about it before disappearing back into time. Plenty of big ideas and a long vista, but not much of a story in personal terms. Basically, it's just a travelogue.<br /><br />  The 1960 version took the basic ideas, and turned it into more of an adventure film rather than just a Big Idea story, fleshing out the Time Traveller and making him much more of a person the audience could get emotionally involved with. It was well done and enjoyable to watch - but also had the advantage of presenting a lot of novel ideas and imagery on screen for what was the first time for many people.<br /><br />  Fast forward to 2002. Time travel is old hat to audiences; they've grown up seeing it in all kinds of variations, from tragedy to comedy. Ditto for dystrophic post-apocalypse futures. This latest version attempted to refresh the story by giving the hero (And yes, it's also a hero story) much more of a background and motivation to travel in time. Further, it added a complication HG Wells never addressed - the trouble with the paradoxes of time travel.<br /><br />  It was a more ambitious storyline, and ultmately, harder to bring off. The bar was higher, the goals were greater, and the end result didn't quite succeed as well as the first movie in putting together a sufficiently satisfactory conclusion.<br /><br />  The other thing that happened is the future changed drastically between filming the movie and releasing it. There was supposed to be a scene showing New York City being destroyed by huge chunks of falling space debris, including the Twin Towers. Before they could release the movie, 9-11 happened, and there was no way they could let it go into the theaters after that. Months of delay and some re-working followed, and they never quite gave it the promotion it needed.<br /><br />  All that being said, if you've never seen the George Pal version, and just watch it for the story you see on the screen, it's not the worst way to spend a little time. The scenes in 1899 are fantastic; NYC a bit over a hundred years later ain't too shabby (the first scene with Orlando Jones is a hoot), and the special effects are quite enjoyable.<br /><br />  Some day, I'm hoping they will release a version restoring the footage that had to be cut; I'm still wondering how they had to change the movie to work around that, and what it might have done to the overall result. Just for fun, if you can find someone who has never seen either film version nor read the book, I'd like to know how they'd react to the 2 films if they saw the Simon Wells version first, and the George Pal version second.well as the first movie in putting together a sufficiently satisfactory conclusion.  <br />        The other thing that happened is the future changed drastically between filming the movie and releasing it.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|My first impression  of Joe Wright's version was that it was barely tolerable...but decided it was probably worth a second viewing.  <br /> <br />Like Lizzie (aka Kiera K) how could I have been so blind?  The film is a masterpiece, blinded by my own prejudice of previous adaptations and the original novel. This version deserves, if not demands, a second viewing.  Keira Knightley is astounding.  Yes, she is more outwardly emotional than Austen's 18th century heroine and probably more beautiful from a 21st century perspective but  the essence of the youthful, wilful and independent Lizzie is just fantastic to watch. Oscar nomination rightly deserved -  Girl you was robbed! <br /> <br />Joe Wright, the director, says he put his heart into this production, and OK I don't agree with all his casting decisions Donald S (mad professor with bad hairdo)and Tom Hollander, far too drippy,'sensitive'and to cap it all short which they play upon suggested by Hollander. In the book the odious Mr Collins is considered tall, well over 6ft and wonderfully pompous.  I like this so wish they hadn't changed him quite so much.   <br /> <br />However as a director, Joe Wright has created a truly beautiful, moving yet comic production.  The cinemaphotography and music further enhance the experience. For me this was only obvious on the second and subsequent viewings. It is a truly multi-layered production, as all good films should be and the opening dance scenes are so full of energy and life. Yes, there are discrepancies with the novel but you still want to be there!     <br /> <br />I know the Bennets look poverty-stricken but this helps re-inforce the differences in social standing between Lizzie and Darcy to a modern audience, in a way that the 1990 mini series and the 1980s more faithful versions can't convey.    <br /> <br />In the additional material I particularly love when the director says 'it's not about the most beautiful people in the room' because ironically it is! You can't get much more stunningly handsome couple as Keira Knightley and Mathew Macfadyen, but quite rightly so, because at the end of the day they can both act and 'the magnetism' is also there. <br /> <br />The actors are all fantastic.  Brenda Blethyn superb, Rosamund Pike ethereal, Jenna Malone and Carey... silly and annoying but at 15 and 16/17? so they should be - great. Mary was far too beautiful but I give the director leave on this as our Mary gets such a raw deal usually. On the downside Bingley and the Gardiners were disappointing:   <br /> <br />When Lizzie says to Jane re Bingley,  'I give you leave to like him, you have liked far stupider a person.' I thought, Really? Is that possible!!! However, his gaucheness grows on you.   <br /> <br />The Gardiners are supposed to be the refined, elegant relations but here we get Penelope Wilton (who can look elegant) and her portly husband are continually munching pies! Can't find any redeeming features here... <br /> <br />Not sure about the Titanicesque sequence on the cliffs as I always want to stand up and shout - LIZZIE DON'T DO IT!   <br /> <br />Inspite of these interpretations it's still a fantastic film with or without 2 endings. <br /> <br />Overall I prefer the UK version ending (thank you Joe Wright and UK audiences) as it reflects the ending in the book and the author would have approved.  <br /> <br />At heart I am a true purist but it is fun to watch the syrupy yuky USA ending. Bare ankles, Divine Goddess!! My God - snogging! All that is missing in the USA ending was the dreaded wedding. I would like to think Jane would have approved but fear she would not. Will no doubt hopefully appeal to a younger generation though.  So, if that means more people will read and enjoy Jane Austen as much as I have over the years then what more can one ask for.
B000E97HIA|2.0|I honestly think that standards as to what constitutes a so called fantastic album have drastically changed.  I must be aging a bit, because as I read critiques from so called album/cd critics who are half my age, I begin to wonder what the hell they are listening to!  This latest prince release \\"3121\\", is being touted as his best work in decades?  After a few plays, I realized that half this CD sounds like it was manufactured with a computerized allstar band complete with those fake drum machines.  If you listen to \\"Purple Rain\\", or even his \\"Greatest Hits\\", Prince was laying down some masterful stuff that has to this day withstood the test of time.  Great song writing, but most of all great musicianship that is sorely missing from this CD.  There is absolutely nothing on this CD that is going to touch \\"Little Red Corvette\\", \\"1999\\", \\"Purple Rain\\", \\"Kiss\\", \\"u Got The Look\\", \\"Cream\\" and many other classics that have those memorable guitar riffs and vocals, not to mention some great backing musicians. There is nothing on this cd that is earth-shattering or for that matter will even be remembered a year or two from now.  I was very disappointed with this effort, and even more discouraged that the younger music generation thinks that this is grade\\"A\\" material.   <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had never heard of the TV series Firefly till seeing this movie! By far this is one of the best action movies of this genre that I have seen!

0143036556|2.0|Most of this book consists of stories of failed societies. The Viking settlement of Greenland, the polynesian people of Pitcairn Island (before \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\"), the sad history of Haiti, the early people of Easter Island who erected the giant stone heads - these are a few of the topics of this book. Even those knowledgeable about world history will find new and interesting material here. <br /> <br />However, the book falls apart when Diamond uses the above examples to launch into an environmentalist diatribe on the virtues of central planning. The lessons to be learned from the above collapses are contradictory; at one point the author says the secret to survival is a strong central government and at other times he says the secret is not having a strong central government. Greenland society collapsed because of global *cooling* - what can we learn from that? Since the time of Malthus, scholars have been predicting the apocalypse on the basis of flawed \\"scientific\\" models, each writer claiming his model is more accurate than those that came before. You can put this book on the shelf next to other works in the Malthusian tradition such as \\"The Limits to Growth\\" from the Club of Rome.  <br /> <br />It is fascinating to read about the demise of the Greenland Scandinavians, who apparently would have survived if only they had eaten fish like all other Scandinavians, and it is fun to ponder what would have happened if early Scandinavian settlements in eastern Canada had taken root. But those events have absolutely nothing to teach us about preserving human civilization in the 21st century. Instead, read Paul Ormerod's \\"Why Things Fail,\\" on how unrealistic it is to think anyone can predict the future.
1881273156|5.0|It is amazing how such a simple concept as put forth in this book can so radically change your marriage.  This book was recommended to my husband and I at a recent marriage seminar we attended.  We have only been married two weeks and are still in what Chapman refers to the \\"in-love\\" stage.  However, as this is a second marriage for both of us we are trying hard to make sure we stay in that stage.   <br /> <br />After reading the introduction and the five love languages: <br />-Touch <br />-Words of Affirmation <br />-Acts of Service <br />-Quality Time <br />-Gifts <br /> <br />We spent time guessing each others love language before taking the test.  We were surprised to find out we were both right on our primary languages, I however never would have guessed my husband's secondary language.  This opened us up to a great discussion of our needs and if they were being met.  Turns out while my husband had figured out what made me happy (acts of service), he never saw the acts of service I did for him as an expression of love.  He now looks at the things I do for him in a totally different way.  At the same time, I am making an effort to not get angry when he doesn't see those things.  I now understand they don't mean the same thing to him. <br /> <br />The book's premise is very common sense, yet it is something we all too often don't stop to think about.  The book is religion based, but even for those that are not religious, it is a good concept.  And while the author does refer to religious passages, it isn't shoved down your thoat like many books have a way of doing.   <br /> <br />The chapter I felt was most useful, and I wish I had read during my first marriage was \\"Loving the unlovely\\".  This is such a hard concept, but really stresses how our own actions can dramatically change an unhappy situation, even if the other party isn't interested in helping.  I don't know if it would have saved my first marriage.  But I fully intend to make sure my new husband's lovetank is kept on full at all times and I really believe this book gave me a much better understanding of how to do this.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This one's a home run -- I've got an old letterbox videotape in which HAN SHOOTS FIRST and I infinitely prefer it to the other versions (VHS and DVD) that I've acquired over the years.<br /><br />The ship designs take earlier work (Silent Running in particular, also Dark Star) several steps further, the cinematography set a new standard. Lucas essentially pioneered computer graphics after taking models as far as possible.<br /><br />It's a TERRIFIC story -- first rate! Find yourself a copy of \\"The Hidden Fortress,\\" a Japanese samurai film Star Wars was very loosely based on. The idea of \\"droids\\" being seamlessly integrated into everyday life was brilliant. The dialouge is truly awful at points, but somehow the three leads pull it off. Alec Guiness lends credibility to what might have been a lightweight outing otherwise.<br /><br />I wish that I had anything good to say about the sequels that followed this incredibly great picture. They just don't measure up. This, however, is one of the best films ever made.
0316168815|2.0|While I appreciate the way Sebold uses literary elements in her writing (and uses them well), I simply did not like the story. The characters are dark and the plot is depressing. The book is advertised as a story of hope, yet I felt as if the story was hopeless. What kind of hope lies in going to a heaven where you are consumed with the past and with watching the world you left? Where is the hope in a family that is ripped apart by death and cannot seem to let go of the pain, even 10 years later? Do not read this book if you want to feel uplifted or inspired... It's darkness and pain carries from the first page to the last.  <br />
B000005RFH|4.0|This is one of the coolest album covers ever -- and the music ABSOLUTELY lives up to the graphic image which graced the album cover.  In 1970, Satan become hip with other bands delving into the dark side, to wit, Coven and Black Widow.  If preachers dismissed rock with their banal ravings, then living up to the accusation of perfroming the Devil's music proved too enticing to avoid.  The atmosphere of the USA after the grizzly Manson killings produced Esquire Magazine's notorious March 1970 issue which was almost completely devoted to the growing trend among flower children with the black arts.  One L.A. policeman interviewed for the article went on and on about \\"Satanic dope fiends\\", and on the heels of Altamont it looked as if the counter-culture was finally gonna stick it to the ultimate authority figure: Jesus Christ. <br /> <br />So, with bands like Coven staging Black Masses complete with a roadie hanging from a cross only to jump off and invert it, it's easy to see how Black Sabbath's first tour was delayed.  But they eventually arrived while the other bands fell by the wayside. <br /> <br />This album along with Black Widow's \\"Sacrifice\\" and Coven's \\"Witchcraft\\" prove once and for all that not ALL long hairs from 1970 dug Jesus Christ Superstar.  In fact, many were ready to \\"Hail Satan!\\" their way across America, pointing out that God fearing American's supported Vietnam. <br /> <br />Hail Satan!!!
1932100385|5.0|After being introduced to this book, I was intrigued by the connection between diet and disease. This book convinced me that the relationship is very strong and that a person who adopts a lifestyle that eliminates most animal proteins from the diet will live a longer and healthier lifestyle. I think the science is sound and that the authour clearly indicates what he knows to be bonified fact proven by research; and what he beleives to be biologically plausible arguements for further connections between diet and disease. <br /> <br />I have personally dropped my total cholesterol number from 210 to 122 in less than a year. I have also lost 30 pounds and feel absolutely great. You will really be surprised how your tastes will change. I have not totally eliminated animal protein from my diet but have reduced it to near nothing. I still eat a little butter and some fish about once per week. I am working out with weights and have actually gained in strength quite a bit while eating a whole foods plant based diet. You have to try this lifestyle. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. <br />I want to personally thank Dr.Campbell for writing the book.
0553579908|4.0|I believe this series was originally meant to be a trilogy, and the middle volume of a trilogy is frequently its weakest point. In this case, the action inevitably lags at some points as Martin deals with the necessity of explaining the ever-more-complicated action. About two-thirds of the way through, though, things pick up, as Theon Greyjoy (a Shakespearean tragic character if ever there was one) assaults and captures Winterfell, seat of the Starks for millennia, and as the Brothers of the Night's Watch, Jon Snow among them, discover the wildlings massing for a southward invasion, and as Arya Stark, now on her third or fourth false name, tries to keep her wolflike courage. As in the first volume, the character development is rich and engrossing -- especially that of Tyrion, the dwarfish Lannister, now acting as Hand of the King, as he tries to prepare for the assault of King Stannis against King's Landing. He's on the wrong side (I guess), but Tyrion is essentially an admirable character. And what a battleground the Blackwater is, too! We don't see much of Robb Stark this time, except secondhand as he wins battle after battle. And there's not much of Jaime Lannister, chained in the dungeons of Riverrun. But when I put this volume down, I immediately picked up the next one and turned to the first chapter. The author's got me for the full ride, obviously.
0553208845|4.0|One point this book made that I especially enjoyed is that it is only knowledge that can be taught, but not wisdom. In the end Siddhartha become One with Gotama but it was not by following Gotama's teachings or being his disciple. His own self-reflection of the experiences that he gained by following his own path led him ultimately to wisdom and to Gotama. I believe that this is true not only for Buddhism but many other religions. For example, becoming closer to Jesus, understanding the meaning of Christianity is not necessarily acheived by following the bible line for line (as some fundamentalists are apt to do) but by straying from the \\"right path\\", by questioning the teachings and gaining experiences. Only by seeking our own path can we gain true understanding of the meaning of our lives.
0679777547|4.0|This was the first book I read by Perez-Reverte, and I'm hooked.  I've read just about everything that has come out in English and some that were only available in French until recently.  (Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish or else I'd be up-to-date!)   <br /> <br />\\"The Club Dumas\\" has just the right blend of skepticism, hints at supernatural goings-on, and thrilling mysteries.  This is the sort of book that will keep you up all night and make you glad that you did.   <br /> <br />The only major drawbacks to this (and unfortunately to most of Perez-Reverte's books) is his flat characters.  His female characters seem to be cardboard cut-outs.  There is very little emotion here, but Perez-Reverte more than makes up for the lack of depth in his characters with his erudition and obvious love for his craft. <br /> <br />Dear readers, keep reading these great books, especially \\"The Club Dumas\\", and dear translators, please hurry to translate his other works into English soon!
0930289455|5.0|This \\"Prestige format\\" novella is arguably Alan Moore's most controversial work.  Some readers feel it's just horror, violence and perversion for their own sake.  Even Moore himself has written it off, saying that unlike _Watchmen_ or _From Hell_, it isn't \\"about\\" anything.  I disagree, as it deals--albeit through the exaggerated, macabre characters of Batman and the Joker--with the question,  \\"Do we shape our lives or do our lives shape us?\\"  Is it true, as the Joker attempts to prove, that \\"all it takes is one bad day\\" to show that life is a cruel joke, and therefore the best response is to go mad and add to the cruelty?  Or is it true, rather, that even if one isn't responsible for one's personal tragedies and suffering, one can rise above them and create a life of order and morality, like the Batman?  Is reconciliation possible between mortal enemies, and if so, what must be sacrificed?  Is there any common ground allowing criminal and pursuer to get past their masks and have a moment of true encounter?  Whether or not Moore realized it, he has created a powerful existential drama.  If Camus or Satre had written Batman, they may well have created something like _The Killing Joke_.    No review would be complete without mentioning the astounding line art of Brian Bolland.  His portrayal of the Joker, at his most horrific and most sympathetic, has become definitive.  Two panels in particular stand out:  First is the chilling, nightmarish portrait on p. 32 of the newly-disfigured Joker in the first throes of insanity.  His expression is not so much evil or murderous as it is a primal shriek of terror at the absurdity and horror he finds at the root of existence, reminiscent of Munch's _Le Cri_.  Second, and more subtly, is the panel on p. 46 where for a moment it appears the Joker is considering that perhaps the Batman's world-view is correct and therefore he should accept his offer of psychological and moral rehabilitation.  I won't spoil the ending by revealing the Joker's choice, save to say that this masterful novella ends with a shared joke that illustrates, better than any Batman work before or since, the existential conundrum that is Batman (reason) vs. the Joker (absurdity).

B000E33VWW|2.0|I enjoyed the acting and I can see why Philip Seymour Hoffman won an oscar but I still dotn think it was the best acting od the year and I can see why Catherine Keener was nominated becouse she is a great actress but the story was boring. The film goes no where from start to finish yes I know it's a drama but some drama's catch you in the begging and your hooked but this film did not. The film is not a really bad film but it's not close to being good. The question is would I recomand this film the answer is i would not even thought the acting was good the story is boring and it drags on and on and on.
0800177355|4.0|Can't help it, I'm a Stallone fan (though I didn't care for the dingy movie with Dolly), but this one is great for the collection. I started following this actor with all the Rocky movies, then Rambo, etc. This movie has the unforgettable death scene that hooks you in the beginning, and the stunts with the 'plane' that follow are excellent. When you mix mountain climbing with lots of snow and ice, and toss in some bad guys, there's bound to be a lot of action. The movie hasn't edged out the Rocky and Rambo movies as my favorites, but it's a good Stallone flick.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I enjoyed this film from start to finish. The story is a drama so there is no action or nothing but that's good. It's a haunting love story that will get you hooked and will not let you go. The acting is excellent and every actor gives oscar worthy performances the acting is the best I ahve seen in a long time. The score is great for the filma nd the scienry is great especially for some on who ahs seen where they film (in jasper/banff albert). Overall I would dnot say it's the best film of 2005 but it's up there as being one of the best films of the year.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Overall, this movie was tastefully done. I heard an interview with daughter Roseanne and can understand why this would be very hard for the children to watch. No one likes seeing the light shined on their parent's moments of 'weakness', and both certainly had their struggles, but I think the characters brought out the love and tenderness of these two very wonderful people. We all have our faults, and the Cash legacy will live on not only through their music, but through their beautiful children as well. I hope everyone who watched the movie also has the opportunity to listen to the interviews of the Cash family memories as told from the heart by their daughters.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

B00005JLEJ|2.0|I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with \\"Kagemusha\\" and \\"Ran\\", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about \\"historical\\" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no \\"ugly\\" shot in either \\"Ran\\" or \\"Kag\\" - merely that there are more \\"authentically Japanese\\" films out there to choose from.
B000002IZ4|5.0|After hearing the great \\"Core\\", I wasn't expecting the follow-up to be much better but boy was I in for a surprise!  \\"Purple\\" is quirky and unexpected where \\"Core\\" was more predictable hard core grunge but \\"Purple\\" is also the much, much better album both in the quality of the songwriting and the complexity of the ideas of the tracks.<br /><br />No doubting that \\"Core\\" has a few killer tracks and \\"Plush\\" with its simple and yet complex sounding chords made me and my band want to cover as many of their tracks as we could but we found that we ended up covering more tracks on \\"Purple\\" instead because they were more interesting and fun to play.  That's the beauty of STP in that the De Leo brothers were never shy of experimenting with chords and they would purposely avoid playing a standard chord and look for more exotic ones to substitute them with.  \\"Plush\\" is a great example of this and it's so simple to play that even though all these years I haven't played it on the guitar, I still feel confident I can simply pick up my guitar and still play 90% of the piece without error.<br /><br />\\"Purple\\" is almost like a jazz album in the way it's written and is a real enigma to me even to this day.  Starting out with the brilliant \\"MeatPlow\\" that is overflowing with exotic-sounding chords, the album moves on to one of my old band's favourite songs to warm up to, \\"Vasoline\\", and carries on to what can only be described as what country music would sound grunge style in \\"Interstate Love Song\\" one of my band's favourite tracks to cover.  The riffs and the intro has a distinctly country feel about them.<br /><br />Then we get the acoustic and excellent \\"Pretty Penny\\" which is a joy to play if you are into folk guitar because yet again, we get to play exotic chords all the way.  \\"Big Empty\\" is simply another beautiful track and is one of their best ever.  \\"Unglued\\" is the ultimate jam song and one of the easiest to play but sounds very complex indeed.<br /><br />All the tracks flow very nicely here and like any classic album, move the tracks in any other order and the overall album suffers for it.  I can't wait for a proper remastering job on this album and on \\"Core\\" with perhaps a mini-lp sleeve packaging design thrown in as well.<br /><br />By far, STP's best album and one of the best grunge albums of all time.  This is that rare album that both casual fans and musicians can truly appreciate as a genuine work of art.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!the tracks flow very nicely here and like any classic album, move the tracks in any other order and the overall album suffers for it.

B00015YVDG|5.0|What would you do if a child of yours was taken from you and put up for ransom?  That is the question that director Ron Howard (\\"Apollo 13\\") leaves the audience to ponder in his action-thriller \\"Ransom\\", starring Mel Gibson (\\"Braveheart\\" & `Lethal Weapon' franchise), Rene Russo (\\"Lethal Weapon 3\\"), and Gary Sinise (\\"Forrest Gump\\"). <br /> <br />\\"Ransom\\" is the story of multi-millionaire airline executive Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson), whose charmed life is flipped upside down when a gang of criminals kidnap his only son.  Asking for a hefty ransom while threatening to kill the child if the family doesn't pay, Mullen and his wife (Rene Russo) choose to pay the ransom.  However, due to police mistakes the ransom drop is botched, leaving Tom to wonder what will happen if he continues to rely solely on the police and the F.B.I. to solve this case and return his son to him safely.  That is when this desperate father does what no one thought possible, he turns the tables on the kidnappers by placing a bounty on their heads.  Now with the kidnappers on the ropes and tensions high, it's a battle against time and fate for the kidnappers to make their decision and for Mullen to get his son back alive. <br /> <br />This critically acclaimed box office smash had the perfect blend of action, suspense, and drama all carefully crafted by Academy Award winning director Ron Howard and his producer Brian Grazer.  With outstanding performances by the entire cast, especially Mel Gibson and Gary Sinise who shine brightly in every scene, there is not a single weak moment in this entire film.  With plenty of twists and turns that will keep your head spinning so that you don't know whose right and wrong, \\"Ransom\\" is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. <br /> <br />\\"Ransom\\" is a definite must-see, it would be a huge mistake on anyone's part not to watch this movie. <br /> <br />\\"Ransom\\" is rated R for violence and language.

B00063EMJ6|5.0|Everyone knows that Neil Young is a music legend so, having not really heard his music before, I had pretty high expectations of this album.  I'm happy to say they were not disappointed.  I'm glad that I chose this CD as the starting point to the career of an artist who has achieved so much over the course of a long career because it really showcases Young's greatness as a lyricist and performer.  This man really is multifaceted, and his music reflects that.  There are so many songs on here and even though some longtime Neil Young fans will probably be disappointed with the track listing, all the songs I wanted to hear can be found on this album. What's more, it will probably be inspired to look further into Neil Young's musical catalogue. There are too many great songs on this album to list, so just buy it.
B000002U8G|5.0|Pink Floyd has two definite eras - the insanity and psychedelia of the Syd Barrett days and the much more familiar Floyd that gave us \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", \\"The Wall\\", and \\"Meddle\\".  Of course, we don't want to exclude \\"Animals\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  Fact is, Pink Floyd produced an amazing musical legacy with each album almost a cult figure in its own right.<br /><br />  \\"Meddle\\" is the first album to feature Dave Gilmour's indelible stamp.  Prior to this work, the band had to travel from the ravings of \\"Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\" to a more cohesive but no less intriguing style.  Indeed, the best of the Barrett work, \\"Lucifer Sam\\" and \\"Astronomy Domine\\" bear no resemblance to what we find starting with \\"Meddle.\\"<br /><br />  Gilmour opens the album with great slide work - bottleneck from Jupiter, perhaps.  The CD however drops into a dreamy ethereal world for most of what was Side One, with the exception of the throwaway dog blues \\"Seamus\\" at the end.  It's cute the first time or two, but not a stellar moment.<br /><br />  I was disappointed when I learned that a recent Pink Floyd \\"definitive\\" anthology had cut the album's centerpiece \\"Echoes\\" by 13 minutes or more.  Taking up a whole side (yes, I'm old enough to have had plenty of albums and I miss their cover art) \\"Echoes\\" combined jazzy improv with a truly mind bending special effects masterpiece in the middle, supposedly an underwater hallucinatory event.  How they managed these sounds remains a mystery and we won't get any help from books on Pink Floyd.  Suffice it to say, stoners will (or used to) melt their brains to this aquatic symphony, and guys with girlfriends who spook easily should take this out to a local \\"scary\\" place for extra effect.  It'd work great looped in a haunted house, too, if it hasn't been already.<br /><br />  All in all, \\"Meddle\\" is a groundbreaking sonic exploration that would pave the way for experimentation by dozens of lesser bands and give us \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" as a follow-up.  You may have heard of that one.oon\\" as a follow-up.    You may have heard of that one.
B0000025DT|5.0|This album came out when I was 16, and I absolutely thought it was the best music in the entire world. Even though Telephone Line was way overplayed on the radio, I still was able to enjoy it. Livin' Thing was my absolute favorite song, and still ranks in the top 10 on my all time list. Every song on the album is enjoyable, there are no dogs. From the slow and melodic Telephone Line to the out and out rockin' Rockaria and Do Ya! to the almost ethereal Mission and graceful Livin' Thing, this album is ELO at it's best. It IS Rock and Roll at it's best.

It does address the problems of having an affair, the reasons for doing it, etc but the conclusion of the film is, I think, too moraly correct for my taste.  <br />WARNING : PLOT SPOILERS !!! After having done all those things, this woman chooses the straight and narrow at the proverbial, as well as litteral, crossroad ?... I don't know. It doesn't tickle me where I like to be tickled.

B000E33VWW|5.0|CAPOTE explores what every writer must experience when they delve into the dark world of real crime. Guilt. Shame. Seclusion. Ridicule. Yet, it was an experience that Truman Capote had never encountered until he wrote IN COLD BLOOD. And as the movie CAPOTE portrays, his venture into this true-life Kansas Crime, may very well have been the very thing that eventually destroyed him.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman embodies Truman Capote in fine fashion and deserved the Oscar, without question. He takes on the role of Truman at the point of his career before he embarked on writing the book that would define his career, IN COLD BLOOD. He's a huge celebrity, movie star, life of the party and successful writer looking for his next story.<br /><br />The IN COLD BLOOD story has been told numerous times, but never from this angle. In CAPOTE, we get to see the story from Capote point of view. How he got the inside track? How he went from shunned and ignored in the little Kansas town, to friend with special insider priveledge to interview and get to know the witnesses, friends of the victims and of course, the killers.<br /><br />What we truly see, isn't how it's done, but what it did to Capote. How manipulating his way into the lives of the people in his book affected his personality and how becoming friends to the killers, misleading them as to what his true intentions were and then having to explain himself as he waited for them to be put to death.<br /><br />There's something incredibly deep, challenging and thought-provoking that comes across in Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance that it almost demands to be seen. This is a movie not to miss. A great movie... all around.
B000001FKY|5.0|It's easy to dismiss Def Leppard.  They really did stand for everything excessive in the 80's.  They had a drummer lose his arm in a car wreck and a guitarist who literally drank himself to death.  In interviews they made no bones about being into music for women and parties.<br /><br />They also managed to make near perfect pop-metal.<br /><br />A lot can attributed to the great studio production they received.  But they also worked hard for their success and Hysteria is one of their best.  This kind of success is not accidental.<br /><br />Whenever I want a big dose of what was happening in the 80's I put on this cd.  It's guaranteed to put me in a good mood.

B00007LTIA|5.0|Judging by the reviews there are a lot of seasoned Yes fans who just don't like this cd.  I happen to really like 'Tales'.<br /><br />Someone called it 'not for the meditative faint of heart'.  That's a true statement.  There are some 'out there' moments that would seem to fit into a new age recording.  But it works for me in this setting.<br /><br />'Tales' is not for everyone.  True, the songs are a bit more experimental than you'll find elsewhere.  Some listeners might even find it a bit weird.  But Yes is a prog rock band and I think they needed to push the envelope some.  This is where they pushed!<br /><br />So even if you're a big Yes fan you might be taking a chance with this cd.  But it's not the end of the world.  If you buy it and hate it then give it a bad review and blast me out for recommending it.<br /><br />Hopefully you'll find it to be as enjoyable as I have found it to be.

034544678X|4.0|\\"The other end of the leash\\" is a book that could easily disappoint the purchaser if they did not know what they were buying.  This is not a book on the practicalities of how to train your dog.  Ms McConnell does not tell you how to make spot sit, down or fetch, or tell you how to teach him competition obedience.  It is also not a book on the theory of teaching dogs, or on fixing behavioural problems.  You will not hear about the benefits of positive reinforcement versus punishment in this book, or learn how to stop your dog from chasing the postman.    However, if you accept this book for what it is, it is truly wonderful and quite unique.  \\"The Other End of the Leash\\" is simply a informal discussion on the similarities and differences between canine and human communication.  McConnell has studied human behaviour as well as dog behaviour, and has come to the conclusion that many behaviours and verbal tones that seem friendly and natural to humans are aversive to our canine companions.      When used inappropriately, these human signals can trigger a fearful or aggressive reaction in dogs.  Less seriously, using inappropriate body language or vocal tone can undermine our obedience work.  When teaching a recall for example, signals that might seem appropriate to a human (leaning forward, looking directly at the dog and barking a loud cheerful \\"come!\\") can in fact inhibit the dog from approaching.    This book also contains one of the most sensible discussion of dominance that I have ever read.  McConnell contends that dominance is a much misused but still useful concept.  She discusses the way that we can mistakenly give up our \\"Alpha\\" status to our dogs by using the wrong body language, and explains the severe behavioural problems that can be caused when we do this. Most importantly, she tells us how we can earn back Alpha status without resorting to physical violence.  However unlike some other dog trainers (\\"Dog Listener\\" Jan Fennell springs to mind!), McConnell does not try to ascribe every behavioural problem to a lack of human dominance or leadership.  She is careful to include anecdotes about dogs that were misdiagnosed as having dominance issues when they were merely untrained, and explains how this misdiagnosis actually exacerbated their behavioural problems.    Her explanations of canine body language are excellent, and far superior to any other book of this type on the market.  Unlike many other dog trainers - Turid Rugaas, for example - McConnell discusses the body language of aggression and fear as well the language of submission and \\"calming\\".  This information is essential for anyone dealing with a potential aggressive dog.      The only complaint I have with this book is that McConnell appears to deal mainly with herding breeds, and although she briefly mentions a few other dogs in the book (mostly retrievers and a few smaller terriers), her anecdotes are mostly about border collies.  This bias is relevant as border collies are a breed that was developed to work closely with humans, and specifically selected to be alert and sensitive to the nuances of human and animal body language.  I know from experience that some of McConnell's conclusions aren't necessarily going to be quite so accurate with other types of dog - for example, dogs that are bred to guard, dogs that are bred to fight, and dogs that are bred to work independently of humans.

Hochschild, not being familiar with the campaign, set out to research it, resulting in this book. <br /> <br />Like the author, I was completely unaware of the history of the Belgian Congo, besides the plot of the Heart of Darkness. But the book is rich with characters, from King Leopold to E.D. Morel who may seem like stereotypes, but their actions lend credence to their descriptions. King Leopold is cast as a tyrant, hiding the atrocities he perpetrated under the guise of humanitarian efforts and his story intersects often with insecure heroes, outraged missionaries, vicious colonial powers, and brave natives. The book is so rich and vivid that it reads like a story rather than nonfiction, and that is in no small part due to Hochschild's prosaic qualities. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this book because it accounts for a forgotten moment in international history that deserves to be remembered. It is in account of the cruelty that comes out of greed. However, it also shows how the press is manipulated, thus manipulating the public, how humanitarian efforts sometimes are created for selfish reasons, and how native Africans were subdued by foreign powers they sometimes outnumbered by hundreds. This book is set between the Civil War and World War I, and these events tend to overshadow what became an important human rights movement. Like Hochschild, I knew next to nothing about the Belgian Congo before King Leopold's Ghost. It will be hard for me to forget the events after reading this. Highly recommended.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic. The vocals are so full of passion and feeling that you want to cry every time you hear Omar's voice. The music as I suggest in the title is very progressive almost out of this world. Perhaps the Mars Volta really are from Mars because that's the only way to explain their unearthly symphonies.
B000002UAC|4.0|Review number 164. Originally released in 1963, looks to be the Fab Four's third (?) effort. Great early fourteen track CD reissue. Still nice to give a spin - in your home entertainment center at the right sort of gathering - such as a over-forty plus get-together, late summer night outing, a picnic, etc. Tunes that still do it for me are \\"I Won't Be Long\\", Chuck Berry's timeless cover \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\", \\"Hold Me Tight\\", their signature song (so to speak) \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" and \\"Money (That's All I Want)\\". Recommended.
B00005A3KS|3.0|The other day I decided to pop in my DVD copy of Point Break, the movie that I believe was Keanu Reeves's coming out party as the worst actor of our generation. True, more people may know him from the two Bill & Ted movies, and now from the Matrix, but Point Break was his real breakout role. In Bill & Ted, Keanu plays an idiot; i.e. he plays himself. The real comedy comes when he tries to act in serious roles, beginning with his star turn opposite Patrick Swayze in Point Break.<br /><br />There is no getting past the hilarity in a preposterous movie that tries to take itself seriously. Keanu Reeves stars as Johnny Utah, a Midwestern boy two years removed from leading his college football team to the Rose Bowl as the star quarterback. He has just set foot in Los Angeles to begin a career in the FBI unit that investigates bank robberies. He is assigned to partner with 20 year veteran Angelo Pappas, who is annoyed to be \\"babysitting some quarterback punk.\\" Pappas is played by the immortal Gary Busey.<br /><br />When you cast Keanu and Gary Busey, you already know that the movie is going to be ridiculous. Gary Busey is known as That Guy who was the bad guy in Under Siege, the crazy army guy in Black Sheep, the aging Cubs pitcher who dates Henry Roengarter's mom in Rookie of the Year, and also formerly known as That Guy who looks like Nick Nolte, although now I would say he is more famous and more entertaining than Nolte. Busey has gone from \\"That Guy\\" status to \\"Caricature of Himself\\" status, and to completely do him justice, he would need his own column.<br /><br />Before moving on, we need some Gary Busey quotes from this movie:<br /><br />\\"When they run they dump the vehicle and they vanish... like a virgin on prom night. I mean they vanish, swishh...\\"<br /><br />\\"Listen you snot-nose little [poop], I was takin' shrapnel in Khe Sanh when you were crappin' in your hands and rubbin' it on your face.\\"<br /><br />\\"22 years. Man, L.A. has changed a lot during that time. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.\\"<br /><br />\\"Let me tell you something, Harp. I was in this bureau while you were still popping zits on your funny face and [blank] off to the lingerie section of the Sears catalog.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm so hungry I could eat the [butt] end out of a dead rhino, I should have had you get me three of these things!\\"<br /><br />Anyways, there is a group of bank robbers called the ex-presidents. Gary Busey thinks that they are surfers, since they only rob during the summer months, and one of the guys mooned the security camera during their last robbery, and he has a surfers tan. So, Keanu goes undercover and heads for the beach, to learn to surf and try to get in with the surfer dudes, with the hope of finding the bank robber gang. Of course, there is a girl (That Girl who plays the younger sister in A League of Their Own) who teaches Keanu how to surf, but more importantly, become the token romantic interest who of course has a tie-in to the bad guys.<br /><br />Or, are they bad guys? We meet a band of surfers, with the leader a dude named Bodhi, played by Mr. Dirty Dancing himself, Patrick Swayze, with a little facial stubble and blond curls. There is the requisite male bonding between Keanu and Bodhi, mystical bull about being one with the waves, and the movie forgets that it is starring Keanu Reeves, and tries to be deep with Bodhi (after we find out-as if we didn't know-that he and his buddies are the Ex-Presidents) giving a speech about how corporate America is the real bad guy, and they are the ones who are really living life by being rebels, searching out the next wave, and blah blah blah.<br /><br />It won't be giving anything away to say that Bodhi and his boys find out that Keanu is an undercover cop, so they take him along for sky-diving (cue cheap symbolism) and let him join in with the Ex-Presidents on their next robbery; a rush Keanu won't pass on since Bodhi has the girlfriend under captive somewhere else. Things go badduring the robbery, and Bodhi and his two surviving bodacious dudes are on the run, with Keanu and Gary Busey on the trail. Busey (the real star, in my opinion, not only of this movie, but of every movie he graces his over caffeinated [over-coked?] self in) gets killed as Keanu won't allow him to shoot Bodhi, since he knows Bodhi must be kept free until the girlfriend is found. We have another skydiving scene, this time with Keanu not using the brain he doesn't have and jumping out of the plane without a parachute and catching onto Bodhi. We have reached our climatic moment-will Keanu, holding onto Bodhi, drop his gun and pull the parachute string at the last minute? A good movie might have allowed us to doubt what would happen.<br /><br />Bodhi goes on his way, and releases the girl to Keanu. The movie can't end here, though. We have to jump ahead 6 months to an approaching tsunami in Australia. Bodhi is ready to ride the wave of the century, and Keanu arrives on the scene to arrest him. Keanu cements his place as the worst actor of our generation with lines such as \\"You crossed the line. People trusted you and they died. You gotta go down\\" and THE line that shows Keanu's (limited) acting rang and (sadly) his jump into stardom, \\"I'm an EFF BEE EYE agent!\\" Will Keanu arrest Bodhi and bring him in, or let him have his one shot riding the wave of the century? Once again, this movie leaves no doubt.<br /><br />Point Break was terrible, yet very entertaining. Like the ghettho-ized Bad News Bears rip-off Hardball, and the so bad and clich&eacute;d its unintentionally funny The Replacements, Keanu Reeves always manages to make movie-going quite an experience. I'd like to say to you, Keanu, and I think I speak for many, vaya con dios, bro.<br /><br />San Dimas football rules!!ve somewhere else.

B000ASDFJU|1.0|i admit that this show has won some prestigious awards, and evidently people like it for some odd reason. in my opinion, the show is firstly, not a comedy in its literal sense i.e. if you are expecting to 'laugh' you wont get anywhere. secondly there is somehow no point to the show, all 4 women (okay except charlotte) have dated and slept with some million men or so; are supposedly profession women who manage to eat out every other day and party late night (never seen a lawyer working 80 hrs a week with a child do this!). the show, in my opinion, is pretty much pointless as well as hopeless!!
0156027321|5.0|\\"I'll be honest about it. It is not atheists who get stuck in my craw, but agnostics. Doubt is useful for a while. We must pass through the garden of Gethsemane. If Christ played with doubt, so must we. If Christ spent an anguished night in prayer, if He burst out from the Cross, \\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\\" then surely we are also permitted to doubt. But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.\\"<br /><br />Piscine Patel, Pi for short, is a religious boy, but the piety he expresses is one that pleases neither his family nor his spiritual leaders. Pi finds beauty in all traditions that see the world as awe inspiring and filled with meaning. He meshes his native Hinduism with Christianity and Islam, considering himself a follower of all three faiths, much to the chagrin of the Imam and priest, each of whom thinks he has converted a Hindu, or his Hindu guide, viewing Pi's syncretism as beyond even Hinduism's collection of various gods. Pi's parents and brother, culturally Hindu but practically non-religious, see his religiosity as a silly side hobby for a sixteen year old boy.<br /><br />Is our world filled with beauty, wonder, and the transcendent, or is it one of cold, logical, calculation? If we go by the evidence, we remain static in doubt. Like Christ in Gethsemane, doubt is okay as a stage, but we must leap past the evidence and make a choice. Which story would you rather believe? The reader will explore this question with the sad turn of events in the Life of Pi.<br /><br />Pi's father runs a zoo. He decides to move the family from India to Canada. On the ride across the ocean, with the animals on board, the boat sinks. One lifeboat makes it, and surviving is Pi, with a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and a 450-pound Bengal tiger, Richard Parker. It becomes a game of survival, as our animal friends are dispatched one by one, until only Pi and Richard Parker remain. Can our deepest fears be transformed into our greatest loves? Can we see our lives as part of a greater tale? We all go through doubt. How we come to decide which story to believe at the conclusion of Pi's epic journey, I think, is a window into which direction we go on the question of the transcendent after we each pass through our own personal garden of Gethsemane.remain.

B00005ASHM|5.0|Surely one of the great albums of all time, Brian Wilson used his troubled genius to unsurpassed effect, pouring heart and soul into this collection of 13 masterpieces. In the Beach Boys he had at his disposal an incredibly skilled vocal group whose voices could blend and mix in the empathetic way that only comes from a family group who have grown up singing, and who were also perfectly capable of recreating the core of the album's sound in live performance.<br /><br />Brian Wilson had worked hard for the group for several years, composing many of the songs, singing lead, arranging the harmony vocals, playing bass guitar and piano and honing his production skills, which were greatly inspired by the work of Phil Spector. He used the same pool of musicians and occasionally the same studio in Hollywood, and like Spector he was an innovator and pioneer who could brilliantly combine unusual pairs or multiples of instruments to create a unique single sound.<br /><br /> <br /><br />It all came together on this album, by which time he had retired from the touring group to concentrate on his composing and record-making. The beautiful melodies and the \\"pet sounds\\" he created were matched by some exquisite lyrics that were written in collaboration with Tony Asher and other writers. Brian Wilson had been inspired by hearing Rubber Soul and was fuelled by an ambition to match it in which he was wholly successful. In turn, Pet Sounds inspired the Beatles to go on to create Sgt Pepper. It was this spirit of competitive creativity that led to his unfortunate burn out during the creation of Smile, his response to Sgt Pepper.<br /><br />Although not exactly a concept album, everything was recorded specifically for the album apart from the traditional song Sloop John B, which had already been released as a single and was included on the insistence of the record company. It does not sound too out of place. The first single from the album was the heartfelt God Only Knows (What I'd Do Without You). This got to number 2 in the UK, but suffered in America from lack of radio exposure by nervous radio stations, who began playing the flipside instead. This resulted in Wouldn't It Be Nice, surely an A-side in its own right anyway, reaching the US Top Ten.<br /><br />The title song Pet Sounds is an instrumental that was originally called Run James Run, inspired by James Bond, and when heard with this in mind takes on a whole new meaning for the listener. The closing track, Caroline No, ends with more pet sounds: Brian's puppies Banana and Louie barking as the song fades. This had also come out on a single before the release of Pet Sounds, but under the name Brian Wilson, and without the beagle and weimaraner or other sound effects.<br /><br />Of course, the original album already resides on everyone's CD shelf in mono. Brian Wilson was deaf in one ear and so preferred to work monaurally, again like Phil Spector. He also felt that he could present the sound to the listener in exactly the way he wished, without interference from any stereophonically knob-twiddling listener. <br /><br />However, a stereo edition was produced and engineered by Mark Linett in 1997 for the Pet Sounds box set, created under the close supervision of Brian Wilson himself, and this edition follows the original album with this scrupulously remixed true stereo version. Not only are these versions often slightly longer, the additional clarity afforded by the sound separation adds a whole new dimension to hearing them, and takes away absolutely nothing. Technological improvements since 1997 have meant that the new stereo mix of Wouldn't It Be Nice on this edition is less different from the original mono mix than on the box setYou).
