B008XCM18Q|5.0|I read this book on vacation and was reminded that I needed to put it down so I could spend time with everyone else.  Oops.  It is a real page turner (or Kindle clicker) that strikes a perfect balance between action and uncovering a mysterious plot.<br /><br />Reading Book 2 now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book. Can't get over all that has happened in this book have to read the last one soon. Can't wait for the movie to come out. Xoxo
B005K0HDGE|5.0|fantastic read, keeps you on the edge the entire book, a must read for anyone who enjoys the what would happen if?
B00785P2QC|2.0|This game is fun and I enjoy playing it all the time. I like the different challenges too, it keeps me entertained.
B00A72989U|3.0|I love the album, except for the arrange for Girl On Fire, because I am not a fan of Nicki Minaj and I have to listen to her in order to listen to the song.
B009NX2XA0|5.0|This is one of my favorite John Wayne movies.  I never tire of watching a good John Wayne movie.  Loved watching it on my iPad.
B003UESJHE|4.0|It is one of the best movies ever filmed!  the acting, the story, everything.<br />I will see it many times over and will recommend it as well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series is great, but I was disappointed to learn after we signed up with our subscription that it is not provided in HD without paying a premium.  This fact was not disclosed beforehand, and it compares unfavorably with the Netflix offering of Downton Abbey in HD without additional charges.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a heartwarming story about this boy who was not \\"regular\\" and his own experience in life and the problem with bullying. Once again Wonder was a Wonderful book!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case was cheaper than the one recommended when I bought my Kindle Fire HD so I decided to buy it. It is a very good case. It keeps my Kindle safe, puts it in sleep mode when I close it, wakes it when I open it, and it is easy to stand the Kindle up when I am watching a movie or TV show on it. I just took it on a plane trip and watched a couple of TV episodes on it, propping it up on the seat tray.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Definitely not the best of the series.  Felt as if the author was just plain tired.  Wish I had saved my money.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Omigod this is like the best book series EVER! You cry and laugh and regret and get angry with Suzanne Collins. I really recommend this book series, only if you're brave enough to have feelings for fictional characters.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I  decided  to read WH, because it was said to inspire many romance writers. I believe it was sheer determination that allowed me to complete it.<br /><br />The story is long; it covers nearly a lifetime of the main character. However, none of the characters are very well developed, with their constantly changing attitudes and emotions about life.<br /><br />So many people die, and many of their deaths are relatively unimportant.<br /><br />Worst, the story ends nearly where it begins, with almost no change in Heathcliff that makes the book worth spending the time.
0061950726|5.0|Young Mollie and 91 yr. old Vivian would appear not to share anything in their backgrounds.  But of course, if they didn't, there wouldn't be this book.<br /><br />There are other characters, but the crux of the story is in the relationship between the young girl and the old woman.  As time goes on, it becomes more and more obvious that the two have much in common and much to offer each other.  The story itself is based on history and the fact that there were indeed \\"orphan trains\\" such as the one Vivian travelled on.  Mollie of course is in the modern day equivalent, the foster home system, and is nearing the end of her time in it.<br /><br />This is a heart warming story which will leave you feeling good, and as such, I do highly recommend it.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I love this CD! I listen to it all the time. It was definitely worth buying!!  Thanks Amazon for making this available!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I put off reading this book for awhile because it didn't seem something I would be interested in, but I kept seeing it on the best seller list-week after week. I finally bought it and couldn't put it down!<br /><br />Great story, well told and an interesting commentary on modern relationships. Although, I hope there aren't many people like Amy out there. I was a little disappointed in the ending, I felt like Amy should have been brought to justice and realistically I think the Police would have developed the forensics to prosecute her. Great character and a book I want forget for awhile..<br /><br />Migraman
1612191290|1.0|If we reflect on the relation that characterize debt, and do so without recurring to anthropological, economic or philosophical established theories, we see a few structural elements that must be present at any moment human beings enter in a kind of debt arrangement.<br />First there is an element of obligation that implies that something should be exchanged in reciprocity to something that was exchanged in a previous moment. The time dimension is therefore relevant as well as obligation.<br />Second, the exchanges might balance each other out, making the parties involved even or in similar situation. This adds an element of value measurement, fairness in applying the measures and the discreteness of the valued object, which must have beginning and end.<br />The parties enter into the relation by their own decision and seek to obtain advantages out of it. This implies a volition dimension and voluntary engagement combined with obligations.<br />This reasoning is just instructive common sense that does not need to be backed up by any theory or empirical evidences. This comes from conceptual implications and semantic links.<br />The implications of these three \\"structural\\" components are also instructive in the search to identify where the concept of debt can be properly applied and otherwise where it does not suit for categorizing particular social relations. The three dimensions are therefore: time, value and wish/obligation.<br />Such conceptualization would remove out of considerations interactions that do not include the three constitutive components. Besides that, preconditions to have the three dimensions can also help the search for genuine debt relations.<br />The indebtedness in the relation between daughters and sons and their parents is a metaphoric use of the concept as the wish dimension is not present, and the value component can hardly be measured never mind balanced out. Precise definition of the concept prevents the quagmire of slippery metaphoric use of the term. By excluding some social obligations from the realm of debt also helps to focus more clearly into what it really means and the implications that it might have. Furthermore, the three dimensions (time, value and wish/obligation) require social grounds where they can exist in a stabilized manner. The debt that might happen only once in a given society does not have relevant meaning; the debt should be a recurrent arrangement, a conceptual model, recognized and supported by the social rules and codes where it is practiced. Enforcement of contracts, private property, tradable goods and services, all are necessary to have debt relations performed and stabilized. Up to this point, it is not necessary to talk about money, which enters the relation more like a catalyst, speeding up the arrangements and making them versatile, rather than actually a precondition. If a society does not have a stable representation of time, valuation of goods, property rights, possibility of trade, ways of socially recording wishes and obligations, and the institutional apparatus that can sustain those social expressions, the debt relation cannot be established, never mind reoccur. So, by definition, slavery is out of question. Slaves do not own anything to their owners. Wherever workforce they have is taken out of them regardless of their will or value. They can never pay back a debt they have never made. Again, here the avoidance of metaphoric use of the term debt avoids getting into slippery ideological grounds, where all \\"cats are brown\\", slavery gets a new connotation, and one loses track of what is really at stake in the discussion. From this conclusion, it is possible to understand that the objective of debt, as a relational model intended to be a recurrent and permanent practice, should not be enslaving; the opposite must be true. Slaves cannot enter a debt relation and therefore cannot lead to the advantages a society may get out of the circulation of goods that those who have them in excess might be willing to lend to those who are in short supply but in condition to pay back in the future. The circulation of goods and service that the legitimate and socially supported debt relation can bring about can be a valuable mechanism of reaching higher welfare levels. Moreover, the reciprocity involved seems to be a key element of social cohesion and stabilization, even if those who lend might get richer than those who borrow (a side effect, not a necessary outcome).<br />If this line of reasoning is correct, is there still any reason to read this book? I have not read it yet, but went through several positive and negative comments, searching for good tips. Still, I am not convinced by the positive reviews. Can anyone one out there give a suggestion?
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I expected it to drag, the only thing I thought that dragged was the fight scenes and my husband thought they were great.  I loved the story line of course.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great series!  Such a shame just one season.  Has right blend of human interest and high tech graphics that were possible when the series was produced.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Great way to pass the time, WAY better than the first one. This one has, Daily Rewards, Single Player, and Mutilplayer Mods.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's great game that makes you think of different ways of going from point A to B, even my 7 year old likes it
B006CHML4I|3.0|Loses about 10 minutes a week,thats  ok.Part of the turf with an automatic.My other Seiko 5's are far more accurate.<br />The only real complaint is the watch stem used to change date time is severely to small.<br />[[ASIN:B002SSUQFG Seiko Men's SNK809 Seiko 5 Automatic Black Canvas Strap Watch]]
B00AU15HPC|4.0|Have always liked Justin. His songs can be so deep and life filled. Like him so much I named my son after him.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|All most better then God of war but better than world of  warcraft<br />Overall this game is awesome and this game is fun
0756666937|5.0|Item was just as described, and it arrived when promised.  My 8 year old son loves Lego and this book was perfect for him.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book. Kept on the edge  of my seat wanting to know what happened next. It was a good read.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love this game. :D Good for anyone who likes dinosaurs or the Jurassic Park series.  Yeah awesome game. Enjoy it!
B004GYY714|5.0|I'm enjoying my favorite stations on my Kindle. I like the Old Time Radio shows, especially the detective and comedy shows.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I thought this was a very nice case for the money- although I don't use this on a daily basis since I purchased it for my son.  Only thing he said is that it doesn't stand on its own but all in all I mainly bought it for protection.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great original storyline; fun characters; fantastic casting.  It's a little spooky, and I love that!  I stayed up way too late most nights to watch &#34;one more episode. . .&#34;
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I lovee this game soo much. It is so easy to play and just as much fun. Get it is the best.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a great movie! It is true to the book, and though they do add some characters and embellish on the Azog the Defiler (the pale orc) plot line that's only briefly mentioned in the book, I enjoyed what they added! The Hobbit (book), though wonderful, can be slow at times, and there's a lot of walking and descriptions and songs. If they had stuck to the book exactly, they would not have had enough to make a full three movies (which is their plan, as &#34;An Unexpected Journey&#34; is only the first in the series).<br /><br />The scenery was beautiful, and I loved the song that the dwarfs sing in the beginning about the Misty Mountains! Though it was a very long movie, it was fast paced and interesting enough to not be boring. It was also not as violent or morbid as the Lord of the Rings movies (though the King Goblin was pretty disgusting!). If I was going to be really picky, I would say that it bothered me how the goblins and orcs looked different from the goblins and orcs in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and that some of the dwarfs seemed a little overdone and unrealistic, I mean... the starfish hair is cool and all... but still...<br /><br />It was also a very funny movie! There were a lot of parts that made me laugh, which was unexpected! The part with Gollum in the cave is very well done, though he loses his ring the wrong way.<br /><br />All in all, The Hobbit was a great movie! I re-read the book afterwards, and pictured Martin Freeman as Bilbo this time, which I liked because I'd always had a hard time picturing Bilbo, and now I had a better idea of what he looked like. If you liked the Lord of the Rings trilogy books or movies I would definitely recommend The Hobbit! Though there are some differences from the book by J.R.R Tolkien, it doesn't really make the movie less enjoyable! :)
B00A757EFW|5.0|Awesomeness plus Pac-Man equals a really great app!  It's a really cool application! Considering that it isn't 1980 it isn't just an ordinary app if I were you I would definitely recommend you buy it!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence carried the film. Woody Harelson was a breath of fresh air. This is a great start to this series & looking forward to the next film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever. didn't think it was going to be this fun but I spent countless hours playing.. a must play
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My husband and I actually went to the theater to see this and we loved it so much that I made sure my nephew got it for his birthday. He loves it and pretends to be &#34;Fix It Felix&#34; all the time. Good story, fun concept.
B000GPI2CM|4.0|I like the selection of music on the disk.  Most of the numbers took advantage of my 7.1 system and new Oppo player, but a few seemed technically uninteresting.  Might be me, but I don't think so.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This movie was great I like it so much I rented it twice.Thats why I have trouble with someone who would give it one star.Are they serious what did they expect when they rented it.Action non-stop,special affects realistic and exciting,acting very well done,plot interesting and much better than the last one in the series.This movie was close to 2 hours long and it goes by so fast it seems like its 45 min. long.That was my experience I think the one and two star people would be the same ones who give Les Miserable 5 stars.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I liked this view of the Washington political scene because it seemed to sum up the current impasse that has hamstrung our current political environment and yet shows how great politicians can rise above it. I don't know how accurate this portrayal of Lincoln was but it certainly made for a dramatic and moving scenario on the screen. I wish all grade school and High School students had to watch this in their American history classes.. Excellent Movie and well acted.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I could not stop reading I had to finish and find out what happened?  Loved it and recommend to anyone in IT
B008M721MS|3.0|I have Skype on Windows desktop, HTC DNA Droid phone, and Kindle Fire HD.  The audio works fine in all environments, except the Fire HD.  The audio on the Fire HD is very poor. Without a headphone, I am unable to hear the audio with the volume on max.  With a Headphone, I can just hear the conversation if I am in a quiet room.  So, I am force to use either my phone or desktop when I am skyping.<br /><br />I am quite disappointed by this, because one of the main reason for my purchase of the HD was skype. I give them 3 stars because the video works well.<br /><br />Please fix this audio problem.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|All I can say is this is one of the best series I have ever read.<br />The best series ever
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This one kept me reading, every page containing more suspense than the one before.  Easy book to start reading and then never wanting to stop until reaching the last page.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is not your typical match 3 game, which I usually like. I rarely enjoy timed games, but this one is the exception. There's a lot of options for power-ups and your ability to customize gameplay from earning stars. Great game!
B00459EZLW|4.0|I liked the second season far more than #1. The last episode left us with such a huge cliffhanger.  I'm disappointed it was canceled.
B007WFR1TE|4.0|The Industrialist is another great album from Fear Factory, however to me it almost seemed a bit mellow for them but then again my top albums for them is Obsolete, DeManufature, and ReManufacture which are all a bit of their heavier side. Overall though, I think that it's worth having and it's Fear Factory so as a whole you really can't go wrong if you like them already.
0937381888|5.0|No better reference in the market. Gives the amateur a where to start point and a seasoned brewer can use it as a reminder and a reference.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I have bad ankles and have never run in my life, but McDougall does a marvelous job of inspiring you to imagine yourself a barefoot runner.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This recording is outstanding! I have shared it with friends and family and they love it too. The ordering process was easy and it was receieved in a timely fashion.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The book was much better than the movie..I was very disappointed that the movie was not more well done I enjoyed the book
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this years ago in hard back and wanted it for my Kindle so when it popped up as free I snapped it up.  Dan Brown is the very best at murder mystery with history and Robert Langdon novels are full of action and intrigue.  The descriptive narrative is done in a way the allows your imagination to work overtime and paint the picture very well.  I have read all of Dan Brown's books and can honestly say they are all my favorites!
B001I45UFC|5.0|Loved this book and want to read ALL of the CS Lewis books now...good for ALL ages..I am a senior citizen and throughly enjoyed it.
B0064QNS62|1.0|I downloaded it because it was the free app of the day.  Thought it would be a bit Mario Brotheresque but i was wrong.  After 10 minutes I removed it from my Kindle.  Graphics seemed basic and the premise boring.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|A pretty awesome season. was very entertaining, especially for those that are into the Doctor Who universe. Can't really disclose much with out giving anything away. but if you are a Doctor Who fan, it is worth watching. i would recommend watching.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It is written as if he is writing a blog or a diary. I loved how the characters personalities and flaws are revealed through their behaviors, especially his brother, his father and his ex-wife. I also liked how we didn't get the whole story until the end. Great read.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Excellent book.  Has a lot of insight and common sense.  Mark Cuban did an outstanding job of putting his ideas down in a way that is easy for anyone to apply.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|Great music on this CD.  I am a Luke Bryan fan and his new CD is GREAT!  If you're a fan of his, you will not be disappointed.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This is the best Bond since Sean Connery. I liked it a lot. Classic bond movie, with modern effects. Way better than te previous craig movies of bond
B00969PR18|5.0|This works extremely well on my Kindle Fire. I have used it a couple times since I downloaded it. It works a good as my GPS.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This could have been a much better movie.  I though this was going to be about this girls abilities to survive on what she had learned on her survival skills but it showed very little of that.  It mostly showed what they would get and dressing them up and getting them ready for the hunger games.  I guess I am not into seeing children kill children.  This just isn't my thing especially since there is too much of it going on in the world in reality today.  If they have a sequel, I doubt I will watch it.  This must be for the young people, not the old.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I used to see these at our county fair back in the day!  This game is so addictive it isn't even funny! Have completed all the puzzles and spent all the dozer dollars.  Thanks to hints from other reviewers, I have over 20,000 coins accumulated, there's no way I can lose now.  Still love the big coin drop after the red one!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I am totally in love with The Tudors. This show is my new favorite guilty pleasure. I am hooked. I wish there were were more seasons.
0307887960|5.0|This is one great plan! We had amazing results with it, when nothing else we tried worked. Easy to stay with, too.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|good acting, sceens done well , don't think wile watching movie, holds your interest wile watching  don't eat the berries!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The story was well done.  The acting excellent, but I do not think the story of children killing children should not be called entertainment
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is so much fun. My family loves seeing my dragons. I wish that I could move my 'vale' to a different Facebook account, though.
B0064QNS62|2.0|Sorry, but I just didn't like this game. Controls are weird and just not fun to play, but that is just me, Download the game and see for yourself, not everyone likes the same thing.
B0061TQBRK|4.0|I like this one album better than Unleashed Memories.There is just something about it that keeps you listening and listening for more.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really like this game. I am almost thru the whole game. Play it when I have any time. Great replay value. I plan on playing it again when I finish the first time. Great Game if u like match games.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story is unque and captivating.  The writing lets you step into the story in terms of understanding the characters and the environment.  I am really loking forward to this ride!
0143119680|5.0|It's a great book to get lost in. The story is fun.  I can't wait for the last book to come out.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show, wished the actors didn't leave show after three short seasons.  Season 4 should be terrific.  Can't wait, will be amazing.
B008AT71WI|5.0|One of my favorite moves from the 80's, so HAPPY it came out on bluray, awesome. It was worth the wait.
B005HSL626|5.0|Are you kidding? It's fruit ninja. This game is my favorite game ever. My niece loves to play it too
B007SOQBCM|3.0|If this had the ability to login and view my subs and favorite channels, as well as use chat it would be great
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. Somehow I wanted there to be another one but it ended good enough to where I'll be ok if there isn't one. Its so good though.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game helps keep me busy! I recommend everyone get this game you will luv it. This game is very good. I play it every day
B00A757EFW|4.0|I've liked pacman forever so its just a bonus that now I can play it without actually going to an arcade.
0470901071|5.0|First off, I hate reading. I really do. So as most people in the IT world know, most IT books are very dry and the tone and material of most books is very hard to follow. I have read books on JAVA, HTML, C+, A+, Network+, Security+, XML, Visual Basic, CCNA, and mobile app design. This book however, is by far one of the best IT books I have ever read. The tone the author portrays is amazing; the tone is alive and I feel the author is actually having a one on one conversation with me. There are some bits of humor here and there to help break up the material and the material is presented in a way that is easy to follow. I used to have a hard time subnetting and was looking for 'my' way of doing it; after reading the subnetting chapter, I can now subnet in my head all addres types without a problem.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to read and understand material<br />Hands on labs<br />End of chapter pratice tests<br />Disc with more practice tests and flash cards<br />Most attention grabbing IT book I have ever read.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Requires reading. (This is more of a personal problem)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's angry birds is there really any reason to not like it. I get frustrated with those stupid monkeys but its still fun.
076790592X|5.0|The book can be a little gloomy with the subject of death always lingering. But actually taking in all of Morrie's philosophy's of life help better understand that death can be beautiful. This book kept me wanting to flip the page and the event doesn't disappoint
B007N5YIUS|5.0|It's angry birds. I'm gonna love it no matter what. My nephews and niece like to use my kindle to play it too.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|This is hands down one of the best debut CDS I have ever heard. Its just a GREAT CD. Sounds kinda like Little Big Town..only better! KENNY IS BACK!!!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|This game kinda confuses me. I can play it better on my laptop and I still don't really understand the rules completely.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Fun easy read there is some witch craft Linda reminds me of the female version of Harry potter look forward to the next book

0385349947|3.0|This was a book many women of the 70s had.  Perhaps a good conversation for young women today. Many of my daughters and their friends reading and feeling enlightened, which is good.  However, my generation of women, thie book is old news
B008XG1X18|1.0|I tried signing up and put in my email. My REAL email and it wouldn't let me sign up because my email didn't LOOK valid.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It was a great read, alive with humanity and compelling.  I missed the characters after I finished the book. Highly recommend
B002RI9PKO|5.0|This is a well written book that is a great addition to literature on success.  It keeps you engaged and summaries it's points well.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the topic of why some people do poorly and why others have so much success in different areas of life.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought two of these, one for the house and one for the emergency kit...Now that I've used them I'll be buying several more to give as gifts.  Awesome little sharpener.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|the whole story of Les Miserables is very depressing. I couldn't even tolerate watching the whole thing. I shut it off after about 45 minutes.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The actors are so impressive. Leonard Nimoy, Blair Brown, what a treat.  Walter and Astrid have such a great relationship going, I find myself chuckling at their interactions.
B001KT6JPA|1.0|Amazon billed my wrong credit card on the account for this movie and others, the total charges for all movies were $33.92 over the last 2 months. Well last month it wouldn't let me watch Sinister but it billed me for it $3.99 or whatever but I got it from Vudu and figured I'd &#34;let it go&#34;. I woke up today and $25.00 &#34;Amazon Marketplace Return Fee&#34; was charged 2 times today from Amazon and my account went from $133 to $78 until *next* Friday. I will never use Amazon again to watch movies! Beware.
1416550534|5.0|This is an engrossing book.  Couldn't put it down.  The author writes gripping details and the mystery keeps you in suspense.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I LOVE ANGRY BIRDS. I WOULD PLAY FOR HOURS. MY HUSBAND  AND  GRANDSON  LOVE IT.  IT's FULL OF  EXCITMENT. PLEASE  PLAY AND  ENJOY  THE GAMES.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Love Bon Jovi and his new album certainly does NOT disappoint!!  Looking forward to more and more as time goes on!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read it in a day, could not put it down - than my husband read it and said it answered many questions for him also!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Again Nicholas Sparks did not disappoint me. I love the story line. In today's world, he show how a woman can be strong in spite of all the bad things that happen and that God has aplan for all of us. Loved it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|LOVE IT!  Incredible stories, spectacular locations, powerful performances, twists and turns (if you haven't read the books), I can go on and on. It's one of my favorites. If you love the fantasy genre, watch it, you won't regret it. Buy and watch season 1 first!
B005K17RU0|1.0|why did you find it necessary to change this app. planning to delete it and find another one.....thanks for fixing something not broken
B0058YPL66|2.0|So I got it because I heard all of the hype from my friends about how great it was. So I told my husband let's get it and watch it. Well, for me if a show doesn't &#34;get&#34; me by the first few episodes its not a good sign (if it gets me by the first- well it's LOVE). And by the 5th disc it was like &#34;do we really have to watch another&#34;. God knows we have a row of other box sets to watch that we have more interest in. Don't get me wrong, the concept I like, I like some of the characters, but I can't get into the main character as the heroine. She is way to casual about it...and as Forrest Gump would say &#34;And that's all I have to say about that&#34;...
B00B10HAO2|4.0|I have not had a chance to watch this movie yet, but all of the reviews I have seen are positive and as soon as I get a chance to watch it.<br /><br />GREAT
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|If you are not watching the Walking Dead, I don't know what to tell you. I know, I know, &#34;who wants to see a show about zombies&#34; that's what I got from a friend of mine who I twisted her arm literally to watch and now she is &#34;crack whore addicted-not literally of course&#34; to this phenomenon. It's much more than a &#34;Zombie&#34; show, it's about human nature, survival, trust, love, betrayal, pain, loss, sure it's set in a surreal world. But how surreal could it be? This show is about a journey to survive and what would it take if you really wanted to live and fight. The cast is amazing and the writing is superb. It is one of my favorites, I recommend you try it, you will not be disappointed.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The best, I just love yhis show. I can't believe it was cancelled. The story lone was great. Wonderful. Great
0670022411|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about reading this after Twilight and all of the other similar books and TV shows out there with Vampires, Witches, and Demons. Don't get me wrong, I love all of this stuff but after awhile the stuff starts to all sound the same in a recycled sad fashion. This book doesn't disappoint, it got me hook, line, and sinker. I fell in love. And now I am on book 2!
B0060D49VW|4.0|Pretty good.not as good as the first one but is quite good the dancing is amazing and I like that quite a few of the dancing stars are from the show &#34;so You Think You Can Dance&#34;
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I love horror movies, old, B, new, cheesy, you name it, well except the really unnecessary gore. And especially the classics and this series and this season doesn't disappoint. Lots of twists and turns you don't expect, great performances by the cast, and each episode leaves you trying to figure out what's up with who. Loved it, miss Horror House!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|It was fun, but it kept restarting me on level one, so I removed it from my kindle and won't be playing again.
0307957837|5.0|This is may come as a surprise to many, but I don't think the answer is any of the more recent Pultizer or Nobel winners. But I hold to my belief that Philip Pullman is the greatest writer of today. The only reason I think he's not taken so seriously by the ivory tower is simply because he is a YA author, and YA authors are really demoted because their readership generally has a still yet undeveloped intelligence.<br />As a stylist, Pullman may have many rivals. Some may even be better. I think the speculative fiction writers today offer society some of the best and most innovative writers, authors such as Gene Wolfe and John Crowley and China Mieville. These writers are pushing imagination and style to totally new heights. Pullman is noticeably less complicated in his syntax than any of these writers, but his writing seeths and shifts with lucidity. Over the years, I've grown to appreciate lucidity over complexity.<br />But beyond sheer style, there's the issue of ideas. Great writers always have more profound ideas than anybody else. They are wrestling with the deepest philosophical questions, and it is here that Pullman shines above the rest. Beneath a playful tale of a young girl's adventures there is the theme of how universes relate with each other. Lyra is the new Eve, and the new beginning she embodies is the induction of a new energy, percolating in from a parallel universe into her own that neutralizes and frees the world from a stagnating, dogmatic world view.  I'm not really aware of any writers that were able to build upon such an interesting, imaginative, evocative view of reality, based in part on the view of modern physicists. Many writers today focus on character but say less about the nature of reality. It is perhaps this profound quality in his writing that makes Pullman stand out.<br /><br />M.P. Gunderson, author of The Ajnir

B0024CEY36|5.0|Ken Follett does it again.  Another outstanding book from Follett that is hard to put down!  He is one of my favorite authors.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I hesitated to watch this movie.  Too many times in recent past movies were touted by experts, and the lay-person alike, only to find it really sucked.  This is NOT one of those types of movies.  It is 2 hours and 23 minutes long that only felt like I was watching for about an hour.  I cannot wait for the next two movies.  I am going to read the books in the mean time.  The story line, plot, cast are very well put together, very solid. I have not rated a movie 5 stars since Avatar.  But, unlike Avatar (whose watchability holds up to time) this movie is one that is a once (or twice) watcher.  There are people who will watch this over and over and be quite entertained.  My son is right though, the first hour is not much action.  the first hour sets up the movie, the characters, and as I understand it, the remainder of the series.  Cant wait for the next installment.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I especially loved the intro with Roddenberry and how they seamed the never before used black & white footage from the pilot!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I found this film to be every bit as exciting and well done as the Trilogy. I can't wait till the next installment.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really there is nothing I can think to add to these reviews. This is an amazing collection and I was only sad when I had finished them all and realized I wanted somehow to have it to do over from the start.
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|Wasn't real excited about reading this book in the begining as we had it required for a department read at work, but as I started to go through it there is some good stuff in here.  Personally I think the authors could have cut this book down to about half of what is in it, but never the less, sound advice to improving attitude, changing opions, and creating a new direction for others and your group.  Worth the read.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis was superb in the role of Lincoln.  Following the behind the scenes efforts to get the 13th Amendment passed was truly thought provoking.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in historical movies because this one hits it dead center.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Up there with Inglorious Basterds.  If you can handle the violence it is well worth the time, totally entertaining and just like IB, a great dream of what could have been.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Your first love is sometimes the strongest love of all even if you do not marry that person . Sometimes we do not appredciate what we have until it is taken away from us . When that happens sometimes life is never the same . It also depends on how strong you marriage is through out your life . The last noise going through your ear at night needs to be your husband or wife telling you that they love you , then you need to roll over and tell them the same thing . Verbal communication is that important . I really enjooyed the book .
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I thought it was interesting and well-written... mostly addressing the physiological and remembered post-death experiences.  While there was a bit of religious reference, it was more in passing than geared toward converting or asserting a specific belief system.  A worthwhile read.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|If you plan on getting far with this app forget it. You will have to spend actual money once you get so far into the game. Then if you make it to 100 pets the game crashes. Complete waste of time and effort!  Customer service does not care . They were informed but nothing has been fixed.
B0060D16VI|5.0|I love this movie because it has such a wonderful story line and is interesting the whole way through.  It pulls at your heart strings with the love of a rat, who helps a young man who is struggling in life.

Best Minecraft related game out there 2nd survivalcraft any thing else is junk.

B008602KQI|4.0|This movie was good.  It kept me entertained with a good story line.  I found it similar to Running Man and I liked that one too.  The reason that I gave it 4 stars is because it was predictable and didn't have any surprising twists or turns.  But all-in-all a good movie.

B000021Y77|3.0|if you are looking for a German movie that has absolutely nothing to do with WWII and nazis and hitler . . . her you go . . . Germany actually does have a culture not involving jews it appears.<br /><br />the movie is about a girl named lola who gets a call from her bf he is trying to break into the mob and messes up--leaving a sack of money behind on the subway. so he is going to hold up a grocery store if lola can't come up with the lost money. so you see her running to her bf and all the people/events that happen to her in the 15 minutes she has to get to her bf to stop him. you see her arrive and what happens. then the movie backs up to the initial phone call and the events play out another way. I think there are 3 runs all with different events taking place over the 15 minute run and a different ending.<br /><br />the first time you watch this movie it is interesting and keeps your attention. but if you ever decide to watch it again . . . the magic was already let out of the bottle on the first run (no pun intended). anyway it has some good techno music if you have never heard of the soundtrack before.

141690977X|2.0|OK, so the book does make some points which I agree with:<br /><br />1. The ways in which men are similar to women, i.e. what they say and what they mean can be entirely different things, many if not most men are seeking monogamy and some form of commitment IF they can find the right woman (despite what they may say to the \\"wrong\\" women), and most men will eventually get married, even if for some men it takes meeting the right woman before he decides that marriage is for him.<br />2. Some good points about the situations that women specifically are more likely to experience, e.g. waiting for the phone to ring, and waiting for monogamy or commitment in some form, and what (as told from a man's perspective) the reality might be in these situations.<br />3. How \\"waiting\\" for a dating partner or a \\"just-a-friend\\" to deliver, e.g. give up other dating partners, declare it a relationship, decide to start seeing you more often etc. is not always a good scenario, no matter how hopeful you are or how much he seems to be worth waiting for... and even if he is a great friend.<br />4. The reminder to readers that they don't need to settle for a lopsided relationship: that there are other people out there (and that the readers are \\"good enough\\" to be able to afford to hold out for the right partner to come along)!<br />5. That if you are not happy with how you are being treated (even if it's just the person not phoning when he says he will), that's a good reason to ask yourself whether you would be better off leaving and looking elsewhere. I like Liz's point that the determining factor is whether you are happy or unhappy in the relationship.<br />6. That if things are not happening the way they should be in a happy, equal relationship (or even if, in the early stages, a man isn't pursuing a woman) it might have nothing to do with what you are doing or not doing: it might simply be that you are not \\"the one\\": that the other person is sticking around for reasons of their own, butdoesn't feel for you how you feel for them. This can apply even with someone you are living with.<br />7. The reality about men and sex: that if a man is refusing sex, most likely it's simply lack of attraction, however unlikely they might be to tell you the truth about it!<br />8. How we, as humans, can deceive ourselves where our emotions are involved, and overlook the unpleasant truth, believing or even inventing excuses for the other person, because of how we desperately want things to be. Also the book admits that there are exceptions to general rules, but that we can easily convince ourselves that our situation MUST be an exception!<br /><br />So far so good.... but sorry, life just isn't so simple. Men aren't all so simple!<br /><br />So, honestly, can a man never genuinely forget to call a woman he's keen on, at the day/time he said he was going to? And then what about if once the first excitement has worn off, he doesn't phone as often or make as many dates as he did before.... does that really always mean that the relationship is dead and she should dump him?<br /><br />Then with the issue of if a guy isn't calling often enough or arranging enough dates.... so how often is often enough? Different people have different balances of work/family/relationship priorities - less contact doesn't have to mean either less interest or not ready for a relationship. (Or, he might be wanting to give her space to chase him to enhance his attractiveness to her, or even just not wanting to rush the relationship by too much contact too soon and assume that she sees it the same way as him.)<br /><br />With all this in mind, I'd be wanting to at least ask the guy where things stand, rather than just blindly trust these authors and dump him because I can supposedly \\"find a better deal\\"!<br /><br />To turn the tables for a moment, women often need time to get to know a guy to decide whether she's \\"into him\\". What about the same applying for men? Look at it this way: he meets awoman, finds her likable in whatever way, but he doesn't know her yet. Maybe he finds her sizzling hot, but he might be dating other women as well (not because he's a jerk, but because he wants to get to know a women before putting all his eggs in one basket, just as a lot of women do with men), or his work or family might take a bit of priority over a chick who turns him on but whom he doesn't yet know personally. OR she might NOT be all that hot (and yes, plain women and fat women do get married too, and to men who earn more than they do) but she's sparked the beginning of an interest in him and he'd like to see whether on further acquaintance she seems to be girlfriend/ wife material for him. (And remember too, that a guy who dates women who aren't instantly on his mind 24/7 isn't automatically a sad loser just because he doesn't have his pick of every woman on the planet.... he might have stirling personal qualities, just not be madly sought-after by women who don't know him yet, exactly the same as applies to women who aren't steaming hot or super-confident!) What I'm trying to say here is, if two people have only just met, (or they may have met online) and the man isn't yet dropping everything to phone her every couple of days and take her out for a meal every week, it could be that he's just BEGUN to be interested in her, and that interest may soon grow, once he actually knows a bit about her. If it's the job of the man to make the phone calls and the dates, then the woman is the one with the power to accept or reject.... but why shouldn't men also have the luxury of being able to suss out women before jumping in head- first, and why shouldn't women be expected to show that they might be good partner material, before they expect to be pursued week-in, week-out? As for paying for dates, the same principle applies: why should women expect men who don't yet know them (and who may be on a low income, as many men are, believe it or not) to take them out for meals(and plenty of women expect better than the cheapest restaurants/cafes too) when the woman might be dating other guys as well, and when she could tell him \\"bye bye\\" at the drop of a hat? (Remember too, that in this day and age since people date a lot, especially now that there is online dating, paying for a meal for two on every date could get very expensive!) and a lot of experts say that in a lot of women's eyes, being bought a meal by a stranger is a neon sign saying \\"I want to impress you, please give me a chance\\" rather than \\"I'm a great guy, I like myself, I expect women to like me for who I am, not what I give them\\".<br /><br />Overall, the message of the book seems to be if a guy's not giving you what you want, when you want it, it can only mean two things: he's a sad loser who doesn't deserve a relationship, or else you're not \\"the one\\" for him and you can only preserve your dignity by making an immediate exit. Sorry, I don't buy this: again, it's just too simplistic. I'm much more convinced by the books by authors who admit to the complexities of relationships. So, you're dating someone you really like and feel you want monogamy with them, or you're seeing someone and want to make it \\"official\\", or you're in a relationship and want to start living together, or you're living with someone and you want to get married or start a family..... who's to say the other person has to feel the same as you, at the same time as you? A lot of experts say that on average women get \\"emotionally involved\\" much quicker than men, so if they dump every guy who doesn't move as quickly as they'd like, they might end up being single for life! (Although I'll also make the point that the same can apply for men, in that sometimes it will be the man who wants the relationship to move faster, and likewise it doesn't mean he should immediately dump the woman if she's not on the same page!) The book also implies that there is nothing a woman can do except wait for the right guy to turnup. Again, I give more credence to authors who say that there are good and bad ways to approach a relationship, e.g. choosing the right timing and wording in regards to talking about commitment, at any level, not being too available or too easily won, etc. Being \\"into\\" someone, and staying \\"into\\" them isn't just like a preference for apples or oranges; it can involve the person's playing their cards right (for either gender). A very blatant example: the book says that women need to find out early on whether or not the man is looking to eventually get married..... er hello, what about the risk that he might misunderstand the question and feel that she must be trying to get her claws into him: the equivilant of if a man were to ask a woman on the first date \\"how long might I have to wait before having sex with you?\\" Also, if things start out well but the other person loses interest over time, it MIGHT be as simple as you're not \\"the one\\", but it could also be that you made a mistake in some way, and either the relationship might be able to be salvaged if you know how, or it might be too late with this person but by knowing better for the future you might have more success with the next one!

044024613X|4.0|This book was a good read and kept me interested. The storyline is pretty basic...A district attorney's 14 year old son is accused of murdering a fellow classmate and we follow the story as told by the district attorney(Jacob's Dad, Andy Barber) with a few flashbacks to the cross examination of the defendants dad. The only problem I had was the lack of empathy or emotion as Jacob's parents discovered some of their son's shocking secrets, and the author struggled with the ending trying to throw in a bunch of random stuff in to try to make the close of the book more interesting that it actually is. The author could have spent less time writing chapters about mysterious cars lurking the shadows and more time expressing emotional discontent for their son's perversions. As far as the ending, I would have left the reader thirsty for more instead of not knowing how to feel.

B00B22IJXK|2.0|I read the reviews and decided to get the app just to try it. I would not have if it wasn't TFAOTD.  But as soon as I opened it, I went to use the blank canvas option, and saw in the lower right hand corner - &quot;Powered by Aviary&quot; ... I don't know how either app works, except that this looked very basic with options.  I just want to let people know that the app is giving credit to AVIARY, and if I was a developer I would not like to be accused of stealing from another if it wasn't true. As for if this app is completely horrible I'll find out the further I play with it!! As I said,so far it is just very basic and plain. BTW, the reason I pointed the AVIARY thing out, is because I was not understanding why all the 4 &amp; 5 star ratings I read before it was the FAOTD. Today it seemed mostly negative.  Thanks :)

B009ICQ6KO|5.0|I often say that a criteria for myself to consider an album a great album is usually how many times I can go away from listening to it for a while only to come back to it and enjoy it more than when I last listened to it. I can safely say that this album passes the test with flying colours.<br />I've been a huge fan of Ben Harper since 2006 when I first heard \\"Both Sides Of The Gun\\" and took to owning his whole back catalog. Whilst I enjoyed most of those albums and thought that he had secured his legacy, never did it occur to me that he was only preparing his best album up until now.<br />In my honest opinion, \\"Get Up\\" is Ben Harper's masterpiece. But I would like to stress that having legendary Memphis blues musician, Charlie Musselwhite, as a callaborator was a sheer masterstroke. Harper has always had a solid blues element in his music but Musselwhite allows him to dig very deep into this element, using his harmonica to add a dimension to Harper's music that you always felt was missing sometimes.<br />For example, tracks like the slow burning opener, \\"Don't Look Twice\\", \\"You Found Another Lover (I Lost Another Friend)\\" and haunting closer, \\"All That Matters Now\\" benefit from having Musselwhite's harmonica sound helping to thicken the soundscope on these sparse sounding tracks. All the while, Harper's vocal performances are outstanding and you feel like they are in their element.<br />Even during the other songs, Harper and Musselwhite's chemistry is all too obvious. \\"I'm In, I'm Out And I'm Gone\\" is a terrific blues/soul stomper with plenty of kick and an engaging riff. Musselwhite's harmonica solo is especially outstanding on this track whilst \\"We Can't End This Way\\" is brilliantly crafted and, for me, this delivers Harper's best vocal performance on the entire album and the backing vocals add a brilliant gospel feel. \\"I Don't Believe A Word You Say\\" sees Harper and Relentless7 (who are on fantastic form throughout) rock out with Musselwhite's harp providing added ruggedness to the track but they take it up a notch on \\"Blood Side Out\\", a fast paced blues-rock track. \\"I Ride At Dawn\\" is one of the album highlights with Harper's haunting slide guitar augmented by some military drumming. The title track is a magnificent fusion of an almost dub-heavy bass line, great drumming, distorted harmonica and some piercing slide guitar while, \\"She's Got Kick\\" is a fun time blues soul rock stomper.<br />My advice is quite simple: If you like the blues or soul, get hold of this album. It is a magnificent release of 2013. My best purchase of this year so far.

B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Giving this a 5 star for following the stargate tradition with plenty of action and humor.<br />Running this series along the same time as the Sg1 was neet since the actors could be on either show.<br />Too bad it only lasted 5 seasons.  I wish they could take script ideas to keep this or stargate universe on for a while longer.<br />They also had plans for a movie.  Well, at least it's on amazon prime. This was the main reason I got the prime membership.<br />Netflix lost the rights to stream it!  Keep it going amazon!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This particular watch is fantastic for me.<br /><br />As others have noted, the band and the watch itself are smaller than most men's watches.  The canvass band, however, is great.  Initially, it was a bit snug on my wrist -- I appear to be in that &#34;in between&#34; wrist size where it's too tight or too loose.  After a couple days on, the band loosened up and wears very comfortably.<br /><br />Setting and adjusting is done via the crown on the side, like most every watch.  Not pictured here is the back of the face; it's transparent, and if you're so inclined, you can see all the nifty gizmos going on in there.<br /><br />This watch does &#34;wind&#34; with body movement, easily enough that worn daily it will stay perpetually wound. Don't expect to be able to leave it on the night stand for a weekend and have it accurate come Monday, though.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Each movie is a classic. I would say that my favorite would have to be Star Trek 4, Kirk vs. the Freebird Burrito! You will have a whale of a good time with this classic series.  Much better than TNG movies (all except First Contact **great movie there***).
B008YKGQR4|3.0|This is best fb app yet. You can share photos. Before I have to go to the full fb site. But then suddenly I'd share a pic but couldn't get back to the newsfeed no matter what I tried. Emptied the cache didn't help. Reinstalled even, but nothing worked.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I was very much involved with his situation in this novel.  Which you could say was the mark of a good story.  The author really knows his stuff when it comes to the technical aspects of space flight.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series met all of my expectations. I couldn't wait to see the next show in the series. Very good acting and a great story line. I would recommend it highly.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Right out of the chute Sherlock and Watson were spectacular! I really enjoyed Johnny Lee Miller as Eli Stone (2008-2009).  However, he was superb as Jordan Chase (the evil villain) in Dexter (2010).  But with his true British accent as Sherlock, Johnny Lee Miller steps up to the plate and hits a homerun for the American audience.  His quirky personality, intellect and stage presence create one of the most fascinating characters on TV today.  Lucy Liu was outstanding in Ally McBeal (1998-2002).  Again, her true calling as a detective with Sherlock is the best character she has ever had the opportunity to experience.  Her quiet words, physical presence and beautiful poise compliments the Sherlock character so well that they are instinctually in sync.  Outstanding ! Amazing !  & Perfect.  The best TV series this 2012-2013 season.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What impressed me most was that a lot of the story is 1 character trying to survive on in an extremely hostile environment where ordinary people could never make it. There's a lot of scientific detail that could come only from a lot of research and en engineering degree. It all made sense and the main character is very engaging - great sense of humor!
0307744434|5.0|I was given a brief synopsis of the book before I read it. I was expecting magic. There were two different types of magic in this book: the content and the style. The content made \\"magic\\" an accessible reality. It seemed perfectly reasonable that there is a way the world works that only a few people can see and consequently manipulate. The magic of the writing is that it made everything exceedingly tangible. I've never read anything like it. There is a flavor in the words on the page; the abrupt introduction of the present tense at pivotal moments makes the events of the story abruptly and delightfully real. I regretted getting the book on Kindle: it felt like a novel that needed to be held in one's hands.<br /><br />The story is thought-provoking, the atmosphere is captivating, and the course of the novel develops into maturity along with its characters. It has the distinct feeling throughout of puzzle pieces slowly falling into place, especially since the story is told out of a strictly chronological order.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to escape to a world where dreams are real.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Was waiting for this to be aired at PBS again but I got tired of waiting.  Therefore, ordered it.  I love it.  Love Alfie.  Delivery was perfect, came before delivery date.  Love Amazon too.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great fun to read book, wriiten well and very inspiring and also educatinal.Would recommend to anyone interested in  photography, both amateur and advanced.
1446249182|4.0|Well, taking Stats II (at the post-grad level) is a bit scary, but doing real research requires statistical analyses of your hypotheses, so you may as well try to get comfortable with it.  Andy Field actually makes it meaningful and though the book is 900pp., it reads well and I'm gaining a bit of confidence.  There is a lot of learn in statistics, of course, but Field breaks it down and goes step by step.  Granted, you'll have to put in a bit of effort as well, but if you're new to &#34;sadistics&#34;, you'll find this book very helpful.  Again, don't let the size of the book scare ya, just read through it a week or two before your class and by all means follow along and make it meaningful for you're interested in researching.  Field has a bit of humor in his writing that should help lighten you up a lil' bit between anxiety attacks, but if you apply yourself, you'll do well.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game i can collect things and then wait for them to load again by playing another game
1609611543|5.0|awesome book for my newly diagnosed husband with celiac disease...love the help.  very informative, helpful and helps us to understand the disease
B0063IH60K|4.0|he game is good looking, plays well, and is intelligent.  I haven't noticed any ads once the game begins and it is nicely customised.  For free you can't beat it.  Join it to a group of games to unwind to.
B008EEBBIY|3.0|it has the one hit song, but the rest of the album is a little less than so so... just my .02
111846446X|3.0|All of this information is freely available on the Web.<br /><br />Well written and useful. It was nice to have as I am a noob and wanted my hand held during the setup process.  After the initial setup, I never cracked the book again because the information on the forums at Raspberrypi.org is more than enough and covers many additional questions.<br /><br />Had I done just a minimal amount of research before buying the book, I would have realized that it was unnecessary. Still, it's well written and informative, just a bit redundant if you have a computer and the internet.  There are many setup guides on the web and since technology changes so quickly, a book like this could rapidly become outdated.<br /><br />Look at the web before buying this book to decide if you really need it.
B00B7HQ1DA|4.0|I purchased this CD the day before seeing Boz in concert. I figured I'd better familiarize myself with the songs or the concert wouldn't be very enjoyable. He does a super job on Rainy Night in Georgia, changing it slightly and giving it an edge. I was surprised by the inclusion of the old Stacy Lattisaw hit &#34;Love on a two way street&#34;, and its turned out to be one of my favorites. The CD is enjoyable but the songs are lacking the hooks of his more famous hits. It's a nice CD but not a memorable one. You won't find yourself singing the songs to it all day like you would the songs from Silk Degrees etc. But if you enjoy the very different sound of Boz's voice, you will like this CD. Not sure about loving it, but a definite like.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I didn't think this would be a good game. Much to my surprise, it was  actually fun. It is good for wasting time.
B0094K1QR8|2.0|Even for a romantic comedy it wasn't very good.  Lacked any kind of effort to get you &#34;invested&#34; in them as a couple.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I absolutely adore this book. Love love love :) I did not even want it to end. Another book needs to come out lol
B000002UTY|5.0|This is a 'classic' from the early days of the great music we know and love. Underrated in it's time; it slowly built a following of fans who truly appreciated unique and exceptional music. 'Happy Trails' did not disappoint back then, and it doesn't disappoint now. A must for everyone's musical library!
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|didn't like this game very much at all. too much dialog and the puzzles weren't very complicated or interesting. does have a zoom feature which was necessary since every detail was so small!!!
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Artistic. But not true to the original novel. I think most people wold be very disappointed. Typical Hollywood perversion of a great novel.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This movie had its moments but not the greatest action flick. It belongs in the mediocre category, not bad and not great.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Stunning movie. Very well made. I highly recommend it. I have not read the book so have no idea how much the two correlate. I think anyone who watches it would like it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I didn't start watching this on TV until season 3, so I was thrllled to be able to get it on my Amazon Prime! Fabulous knowing how it all started....
B006ATJXQW|5.0|The prequel for the maze runner series is exactly what it should be. Gives you exactly the information that the reader needs and answers questions that the reader might have had from reading the trilogy. I recommend reading this after the trilogy, of course, not before.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I do not have cable tv. I love this show and was ecstatic to find that I could subscribe to it and watch it only one day after it showed on AMC. So my Walking Dead nights were Monday! Not Sunday. I had to avoid friends face books for spoilers all day Monday :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Spring for the audio version. It's well done and so worth it! Endearing characters and a beautiful ending. Have Kleenex nearby.
B00258SS72|5.0|I love this movie! Having lived in Garden Grove in the late 70's and early 80's I was very touched by the theme of this movie.<br />I have been assigned to watch this movie for two college courses in Cross Culture Communications.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER SO MUCH BETTER THAN MOVIE. AFTER READING THIS BOOK I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO READ ANY OTHER BOOK AGIAN BECAUSE IT WON'T BE AS GOOD
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|It was too dark, and I really don't believe Lincoln ever went to watch any battles.  Also, did those soldiers really memorize the Gettysburg address?<br />Plus I thought old Mary Todd was wacky.  How did she get so wonderful?<br />This is another twisted look at American history by our Hollywood biggies.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Watch and find out it keeps you on your toes lots of mystereycan't wait fot the next episode love it!
B00APJLX8E|3.0|The previews were a lot funnier than the actual movie.  Kinda boring.  Would probably keep small children occupied though.  Glad I didn't spend money to see it at the theater.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|THis is just a fun game so far from what i played you get to eat other cells and that's is what keeps you  alive and you absorb one after another kinda relaxing and good times to just chill to mellow comforts of you r home and on your bed and plug away! Enjoy!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I would have liked to have gotten more information about the character Charlie's condition. So for me it was just okay.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|I really loved the feeling you get while swimming around in this extremely dark water! trying to survive from the grey gew that eats you if you touch it, just pretty straight forward coolness, enabled the accelerometer to move around add coolness to the whole experience!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Its my favorite Broadway show and now my favorite movie. The cast did a wonderful job considering some were not trained singers
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Okay let me clarify i'm a huge fan of memory games that exercise your biggest muscle of them all! This game does just that! Its cool remember the game memory well its very much like that but in 3D which makes it much more fun and interesting! Enjoy
B00BQ1DAHC|3.0|I liked the first few Volbeat albums.  My overall favorite is still Rock the Rebel, Metal the Devil.  The heavy instrumentals combined with the interesting vocals of Volbeat was an instant winner that I was extremely pleased to add to my library.  As the band continued to produce albums I noticed they seemed to fall victim to the same fate as many metal bands and slowly get softer as time went on.  However I continued to enjoy them until this album.  I listened to the whole thing through a few times and still come away just saying &#34;meh&#34;.  The previous albums (especially RtR,MtD) always left me feeling pumped up and longing for more.  This one just sounds like a half-baked attempt at getting mainstream radio airtime.  If this CD was a Call of Duty game, it would be Modern Warfare 3.  Nothing new, nothing inspiring, nothing worth buying.<br /><br />I give it 3 stars because it isn't horrible.  If the tracks come up while I'm shuffling through my whole library I'll listen to them, but I'm not going to go out of my way to pick this album.  Which is a real shame given how much I enjoyed Volbeat's previous albums.
B006HL9G10|3.0|I had a cool fun time looking at the different options of copper bowls you can use to meditate! Id' like to see sound improvements or more options like would like to hear the gyro noise from using a wooden branch or stick in the bowl hit it then maneuver your stick in a circle motion changing the vibrations etc.. that noise is what i thought i was getting! This is just ding wait 7 secs another ding etc.. you can change the timing of the dinging etc.. good luck have fun! hi5
B001PPLIEG|4.0|This movie was refreshing since it gave 007 a totally different side...his own convictions and bucking the system set down by MI6.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I bought this game originally for my iPod touch but when I switched to my HTC phone I loved it so much I had to get it again, it's very worth it. Ray controls like a dream and the levels, with only a few minor exceptions, are made in a way that calls memories of Rayman Origins to mind: not quite challenging enough to be frustrating but definitely not too easy either. There's one DLC that you can buy if you want, but it's not required (all it is is Globox and a few costumes for Ray) and the game's just fine without it.<br /><br />This is the best mobile platformer since Canabalt. Buy it.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|It's Frank in Vegas with Count Basie, how can you go wrong? It's as close to jumping in a DeLorean and going back in time as we can get.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|this game kept me wanting to play it all the time. I enjoyed it throughly. and would recommend it to others. I accidently bought this is game thinking it was something else.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show and can't wait until the new seasons begin.  I even have my sister watching this show now too.  I wish this show was on year round.
B000002MFE|4.0|I received this ítem in good shape. It came wrapped in shrink wrap as it was posted. I played the CD and there is nothing wrong with it. I am very happy with this purchase.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't think this book was anything special. So the main chick is a nut. There I told you the story. I didn't find it exciting or a paged turner. So hot chemistry, no real action even.The only thing I enjoyed is the style of writing. Every other chapter came from the point of view of the two main characters. OH yeah, the ending sucks. Sorry Flynn don't mean to be so hard on yah.
B0000028RR|4.0|I received this ítem in good shape. It came wrapped in shrink wrap as it was posted. I played the CD and there is nothing wrong with it. I am very happy with this purchase.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I thought this book was very good. There was more chemistry leading up to the main characters other than staring at each other and jumping into bed together. I like the game, the tease.
B000002JSP|4.0|I received this item in good shape. It came wrapped in shrink wrap as it was posted. I played the CD and there is nothing wrong with it. I am very happy with this purchase.
B00846REIS|1.0|I don't know how this is even compared to Fifty Shades. Sure the plot is bascially similar, well what I've read. I had to stop. I just thought it was a very generic version of Fifty shades. It lacked alot of substance. I hate bashing a book, cause I write too. But I could stand to read another word. Sorry :(

B00992CF6W|5.0|While scaled back in size and features of the PC version - Minecraft - Pocket Edition captures enough of the required basics of the original to enjoy your own little land. Not to worry - you won't be alone. Zombies, Spiders, Creepers, Skeletons and more are waiting for you to visit!
B003U4UPHG|5.0|I just recently started watching lost, and I can confidently say that I am now OBSESSED... Lost pulls you in and keeps you wanting more!  Love it.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I was ready for something different and challenging in a game - and Osmos delivered! Very cool... Wearing headphones while playing immerses you in this game!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|David knows how to keep you riveted to a story, the Camel Club just keeps getting better with each book. Keep up the good work and I hope David keeps the Camel Club series going for years to come.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|We've been using this driver kit for about a month for fixing computers. It has any bit you need for computer repair. I would highly recommend this kit.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this book.  It really reflected some of my own personal experiences and gave me the check I needed to start looking at my career from an entirely different perspective. It also confirmed what I have been thinking for the last several years that women have not made as much progess in the workforce as we should have made and that is a problem that we all need to be concerned about.  Time to start making some real lasting changes.
0345528581|5.0|Great book. It has good information and good body weight exercise. I am glad I bought it.  I will buy another one like this.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Plenty of action, drama and even comedy mixed into one great movie.  The acting was superb and no wonder it was given awards.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very realistic.<br />I have it on my I-pod, but it's better on the kindle so you could have a full view and have a good adventures.<br />It's kinda like Indiana Jones movie, it makes you feel like your in the movie.<br />It's not that addicting after you play a few minutes you'll get dizzy from playing to much.<br />That's just my opinion.:)<br />I hope you love this adventure as much as I do.<br />Sometimes it could get freezes up,but it just happens time to time.
1476715904|5.0|Litterally cried while reading this book.  I could feel the character's pain and wanting.  Can't wait to read &#34;Point of Retreat&#34;.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book, addictive. I cannot stop reading it. I recommend this book of you like love stories with spice on it.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|I bought this movie because it was recommended as a movie about birds.  It's not.  It's about a competition between bird watchers.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|best one yet u get to make ur own memes.and it is amazing so u have to try it out and u can do.anything on it
B004OZZ624|5.0|This movie kept my attention the whole time. The frustration with the legal system was apparent.<br />Good movie and not too much violence.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Any translation you want, very user friendly,  what is there not to like, praise God! Need to come up with 5 more words lol Jesus Christ set me free! TyL
B0055PGUYU|5.0|It is great to read a book that entertains you and educates you.  You can tell that a lot of hands were in play when writing it.  I fell in love with each of the people that were involved. I highly recommend this book for people that are looking for a way to change their lives and for people that want to learn more about how people respond to
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I like P.D James' books, and Jane Austen's books, 'Pride and Prejudice' being my favorite.  Ms. James' perception of the motives of Elizabeth Bennett from :P&P didn't match mine, so there was a little disconnect for me, but most of the characters from the Austen book are here, and Ms. James is a much better writer than others who have written prequels or sequels toe P&P.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book sparked a lot of controversy when it was released, and it deserved some of it.  Keep in mind that it is a work of fiction, and a very enjoyable one at that!  A mystery full of puzzles, plot-twists, and danger!  Definitely a &#34;stay-up-all-night-to-finish&#34; type book!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A tale worth reading. Some editing glitches in the front, but then a great story. Gifting to others. Kept wanting to check the chemistry it was so engaging.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't understand why anyone gave this book such rave reviews. The middle of the story was interesting but the beginning was boring and the ending was terrible and anticlimactic. Would not recommend!
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I was Leary of this one, but found myself binging on the first season. Interesting story lines and great characters.
0345531965|5.0|I really do love reading John Grisham's novels!  I just finished reading The Testament.  I know it is an older book but I hadn't read it yet so I decided to after a friend told me that it is was one of the best books he has read by John Grisham.  I loved it!  It is full of adventure and has a great story line that is probably more common in many ways than we may think!  The Litigators is next on my list and I am looking forward to it!!!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Better than I expected it to be.  I will watch the sequel.  Looking for Amazon to gift Prime users with more new movies.
B001E25MBK|2.0|Ive been waiting for this to come out in Blue Ray but was very disapointed in the Audio. It is terrible.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I am a little biased since the story takes place in my home town. I really enjoyed the memories while reading it and it was a goo read.
B009NXAMW6|4.0|Good movie.  Will surprise you at the end.  Edward Norton is a terrific actor and the whole movie will hold your attention.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|I couldn't download this as an error said it has been corrupted.  Big disappointment as I was hoping this would be a good solution.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|As a huge fan of of Sir Aurthur Conan Doyles books, and of the BBC Jeremy Brett Holms, this series is a MUST
B0020M99LC|4.0|The dynamic between Judi Dench and Daniel Craig breathes believable new life into the world of Bond: British professionalism provide a tight container, but the skill of Dench in particular is to allow just the right cracks here and there to reveal a boil of human emotion inside.  And the introduction of Bond as a human with physical and psychological limits adds some engaging personal drama I do not remember B.C.  I can even forgive some of the melodrama in Bond's love-interest experience as the last vestiage of Bond's 00 learning curve.  Looking forward to the next installment
B005ZB91KY|3.0|Probably one of my least favorites of the Marvel superhero series. It was okay, and the kids enjoyed it. I think I enjoyed the Captain America character more in his role in The Avengers.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Everything begun in the earlier films seems to have matured here:  Bond's humanity & necessary frailties; M's believeable personal stake; the relationship between them which hums with respect and something more meaningful for being essentially unspoken.  Adding to this is the satisfying introduction of some new and interesting imperfect-genius types who further the grounding of the story in something more human than the Bond films I remember from the past.  If there's anything to forgive, I'll say it's the whiff of melodrama that floats again in the air, this time around The Bad Guy.  I choose to accept it as part of the rules of the Universe which Bond inhabits, in part because the rest of the film is so great.  I especially appreciate the ending which brings a certain story arc full-circle, to a satisfying close.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Got the movie as expected and it was in great condition. I didn't have problems with any part of the process, and the digital download worked great as well.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|We watched this in my government class, and I'm so glad we did. It's an emotionally charged movie that truly shows you that you can't judge someone before really knowing them.<br />Khan is an autistic Muslim who immigrated to the US. He meets a girl, Mandira, and they eventually get married. That causes tension between Khan and his brother, because Mandira is Hindu. But Khan, Mandira and her son Sam have a simple and happy life.<br />Then 9/11 hits. Everything changes. The family begins to face racial discrimination. One tragedy leads to another, and Khan sets off on a journey to meet the president and tell him, \\"My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.\\"<br />Along the way he meets some people who are sympathetic towards him, and don't care about his religion, while others judge him harshly.<br /><br />I was blown away by this movie. I feel like this would be something very important for parents to show their (older) kids. Especially in today's world where there is so much hate among the different races and religions.<br /><br />Remember,<br />\\"There are only two kinds of people in this world. Good people who do good deeds. And bad people who do bad. That's the only difference in human beings. There's no other difference.\\"
B0093H8H8I|5.0|This is a fantastic processor that can handle a wide variety of tasks.<br /><br />By itself, the integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 is very capable for gaming, particularly when the CPU is paired with high speed RAM and the BIOS is set to share the maximum allocation of DDR3 memory for use with the integrated graphics. Intel HD Graphics 4000 is capable of allocating up 1024MB of RAM to use for gpu purposes; you can think of the i3 3225 with max gpu allocation as a processor that comes with a free graphics card that is the equivalent of an Nvidia GT 620/AMD equivalent.  Not bad!<br /><br />When paired with a powerful dedicated graphics card, the i3 3225's dual core processing speeds- with Turbo Boost and Hyperthreading options- is more than fast enough to support all of the newest games at high quality settings, without being too much of a bottleneck.<br /><br />The thermal design and efficiency of this CPU is great enough that one can use the stock Intel cooler and have no worries about overheating at stock clock speeds. This processor is actually capable of safely going up to 105C, so it has enough thermal wiggle room to even go fanless.  A real first for how fast this processor is. In my experience @ stock clocks, stock fan+paste, in a very poorly ventilated mini-itx case, I saw no more than 55C under load.  Aftermarket cpu coolers are completely optional with this, and that's a good thing to help keep build costs down.<br /><br />Equally impressive is how energy efficient the i3 3225 is.  I am using this in an HTPC and I'm seeing a scant 11 watts at idle, and no more than 50 under intensive loads.  Intel has improved idle power consumption greatly with these processors and energy use is low enough that one can keep a fairly powerful i3 3225 system operating 24/7 without breaking the bank in energy costs, compared with yesteryear's processors.<br /><br />At under $150, there's a lot of performance and versatility per dollar.  As of Q2 2013, it remains in the top 5 performance per dollar offerings of all x86 CPUs.  Despite new Intel socket and processors (Haswell) coming out this year, early results have shown lackluster performance/efficiency improvements, so it's hard to justify spending the extra money on the absolute newest cpus and motherboards at this point, where the inexpensive i3 3225 has no shortage of affordable, robust motherboards it can be placed in.  Gaming PC, HTPC, workstation, or home server, this CPU will serve many people very well.performance per dollar offerings of all x86 CPUs.

0307341577|3.0|After reading (and loving) Gone Girl, I couldn't wait to read this book. And I liked it, up until the end. It was also interesting to recall the so-called \\"Satanic Panic\\" of the 1980's. I had forgotten about that, but the way it was described in the book was completely accurate: in the 80's, devil worshippers were allegedly lurking around every corner, in every town in America. I was a teenager in the 80's, but I remember that quite clearly.<br /><br />Even though the main character Libby is a mean, selfish, nasty human being, I still liked her as much as it's possible to like such a person. Even though she has few redeeming qualities, Gillian Flynn skillfully makes you feel empathy for Libby, almost against your will, because you understand how and why she has become such a complete train wreck.<br /><br />Many of the other characters in the book are also quite flawed, but again, the author is adept at making you feel a little sympathy for their plights. The mother is clearly guilty of neglect, but when you read about her struggles you understand where she's coming from. Ben definitely has problems and makes stupid choices and decisions and is sometimes cruel, but you can see that he is mostly driven by a need for acceptance. It's the rare author that can make you care about characters who are so very deeply flawed; were you meet any of these people in real life, chances are you'd cross the street to avoid them. And there are some characters with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, who are impossible to care about.<br /><br />The book was moving along at a great pace, and I could hardly put it down. Then came the end. I like a good plot twist as much as the next person, but the one in this book was completely unbelievable. The explanation of what actually happened was just too out there for me. And I found Ben's actions and choices on that one particular night (and what he did after that) to be especially unrealistic.<br /><br />It's a shame, because I was loving this book up until about the last 3 chapters. Proceed at your own risk.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|We love this movie! Its very violent and graphic, but a good thriller. Whats even more exciting is the little twist at the end. Highly recommend this to any ADULT.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This was  first game that I had put on my Kindle. It is a fun game. I would definitely recommend.
0375851569|5.0|I wanted this for my son because I had all the Dr. Suess books growing up. This is a perfect starter set to the collection!I love that they also come in a box also.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really likes this book. It was awesome to see a story about someone who had a rough time become happy in the end. True love  always wins.
B00005V1B2|5.0|How wonderfully different and original this band is! With \\"Snowgoose,\\" they're telling us a story and it is so beautifully written! Simply ingenious. Even with no words, their songs play over and over in my mind, note by note, because their music is that good. Their sound is personal - it's not elevator music, not party music - it's progressive rock at it's best. Andrew Latimer's guitar and flute are highlights. For anyone who loves prog rock, this is one you should not miss out on!
B008220D7S|5.0|My wife & I seen this at the movies & we were in tears laughing at times. I had to buy this movie on blu ray.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book couldn't put it down fast read never lost my attention.  I would recommend reading both back to back.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This movie is intense from the very beginning. The story and the characters are extreme, but also believable. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job.
6305428387|5.0|Fun movie for kids of all ages. My 14 year old son really enjoyed watching this &#34;old&#34; movie. We all enjoyed laughing during the trials of the Jamaican Bobsled team.
B00B22IJXK|2.0|Pros: free today.<br />Cons: Really can't do much with it.<br />Another person said it reminded them of Microsoft paint. Ya, that's about right.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I just saw this a few days ago and I enjoyed the singing the most. There were some funny parts with Rebel Wilson but it kinda lacked in the comedy overall in my opinion.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn continues the incredible lineage of Mitch Rapp and his kicking ass and taking names when it comes to those bad people who want to do Americans harm. Too bad he isn't real!
B002BWP49M|4.0|no sure what to say here, never watched it, but my wife loves it.  She loves the series, and I refuse to watch them.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|I've had the DVD for several years and decided to upgrade to Blu-ray. Awesome movie as always! He's a Dapper Dan man!
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This was a good season, but eventually the series, in my opinion, got too crazy  I ended up not watching it anymore.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|I think this must be the ultimate monster movie series of all times!  I watch the shows regularly.  My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the CD's are blank save for a very tiny bit of writing near the central hole, it can be a moment's confusion to get the right side up to watch the movies.  Hey, I said it was minor!  But this is a good way to add these movies to your collection.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Dr Mosley has given us a gift of better health with this book.  Weight loss is really a side benefit to the other benefits you get from adopting this diet.  I am a type II diabetic and have struggled with my blood sugars lately.  Since being on this diet, they are getting in far better control than they had been previously.  I feel better and I think more clearly.  I think there may be some long term cognitive benefits as well.<br /><br />Dr. Mosley has also studied exercise.  His high intensity exercise regimen coupled with his fast diet is a grand slam for me!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This collaboration is a dream come true... nobody ever had a problem with AutoTune in the hands of Daft Punk...
B00005RIKI|5.0|For a lot of us this was our first introduction to Skynerd way back in 1973.  I was listening to pandora when I heard a demo cut off this LP, (whoops, that dates me), and had to find it's source.  Lo and behold the demo cut of Tues gone with the wind and two more demo cuts were on this album and I had to own them.<br /><br />This album is the bees knees of southern rock.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Talent is talent. Justin Timberlake is talented and he would have made records regardless of the decade he was born in. I've always enjoyed his music and movies(Minus NSYNC except for certain songs) That being said, this album is really good. Most of the songs I enjoy.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|after hearing all the hype about the movie and not having seen it i was really curious to see how good it would be. it was great and wonderful having a book so popular bring light to mental disorders.
B0079J28NW|5.0|Picture and sound look beautiful. I really didn't need to purchase this again after the dvd release, but it's the Beatles! Anything they release or re-release I usually buy if it's remastered!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|as a female reading a book from a male perspective i didnt think it would be so relatable. having not been in high school for almost a decade it took me right back to those emotions and feelings i once had. which was exciting.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Awesome picture and sound. They really put a lot of care into this release. I love Metallica and it's good to know they care about their fan base.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|Loved every part of this package, has the vinyl for their first album, demo version of their first album, the first album ,a good sized two sided poster, book of some kind with a whole bunch of stuff and pictures, cd&#34;s of live performances and dvds of a bunch of music videos, and the box itself is awesome .<br /><br />The ONLY thing that could have been better would have been releasing the equivalent of what they did with the first album and do it for all there albums and put in one  box.  RATM FOR EVER!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Not as violent or as detailed as the book.  The movie tells the story in shorthand.  I would recommend also reading the book.  Then the movie will round out your experience nicely.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|ITs a cd of a great album by an amazing band, great sound quality. Its as good as it can get.
0062014536|5.0|My teenage daughter loves this series of books.  She has looked forward to each release in the trilogy.  She has also read other books by Lauren Oliver and enjoys her style of writing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I kind of missed the boat and bought this book on the installment plan meaning I failed to save myself a buck and instead bought each part individually. Nevertheless, great story, great plot and great characters. This is a story that is science fiction second and human first. Having characters in which you find yourself emotionally invested is a rare treat.<br /><br />I don't want to spend a lot of time repeating the words of so many other reviewers but I do want to add that no small part of the book's enjoy-ability is how well it is written; I've read a lot of self-published books where poor or non-existent copy-editing resulted in the story-telling being hugely impacted. I found absolutely no such spelling, word usage or grammatical errors in Hugh Howey's brilliant Wool books.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app! It is awesome and I use it daily, it is fast and very easy yo use, I love the watch features!
1551111314|5.0|There are no words for how I feel about this book. It is my absolute favorite Jane Austen novel, and to read this after reading the rest of her work in succession, you can see the maturity of not just the writing, but the author herself. It is beautifully poignant and will bring tears to your eyes. For those of you who love Austen for her love stories, I guarantee that the love letter in this book will blow you away. It is perhaps one of the most heartfelt, sweet, and romantic love letters in literature. I cannot recommend this book enough. If you're an Austen fan, this is a MUST read.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I love this movie, so I am beyond happy with this purchase!  My kids also have come to love this oldie but goodie
0321356683|5.0|I bought this book some time ago. I love its brevity of words, to-the-point advice and code examples. Item #71, lazy static initialization was a revelation to me when I first read it and I have used this simple technique ever since. I grab it every time I want to properly implement equals() and when I need a refresher on Generics declarations. This is one of the few books that is always on my desk and not on the bookshelf. It is probably my most used Java reference book.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I have not been a social media type person. But when games you want to play force you to have Facebook what else can you do. Yes this is a good application and easy to use.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Loved the movie and the soundtrack is great.  Listen to this over and over again, and my 4 year old granddaughter sings along.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|A fantastic show that would have run for years if not for the efforts of fox to kill it. (showing episodes out of order, constantly shifting the schedule and preempting episodes for sports events, and just generally making it hard for fans to watch.)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I looked many free calculator apps and chose Calculator Plus Free due to its simplicity. I don't often need a calculator on my kindle fire, but when I do, this the perfect app for me. Kudos and many thanks to the developers.
0061743526|5.0|Family favorite for the past forty years! The book and movie have been given to all 5 children and 9 grandchildren.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|this is a good game.  I don't think I should be pentalized (time continue to run) because it has run out of matches or deals no matches.  If I didn't spend so much time looking at &quot;no more moves&quot; I would give it a 5.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This was a masterful movie adaptation of the greatest musical ever produced. Other than Russell Crowe, who was the only cast member we felt was miscast, everyone else was wonderful. The attention to detail, the meticulous staging of Paris and the physical settings was terrific. And having the cast actually perform as though they were  on stage was terrific.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This show explores real human issues & does it with style! Each episode keeps your interest from the beginning to the end!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|It was an inspiring movie with a great storyline.  I was worried it would be &#34;boring&#34; as most of it was shot near the raft adrift at sea however, it kept you focused and there were many funny lines to keep you smiling.  Very well written and directed.
B0094M2SCI|5.0|Like SYFY movies. Vampires the best subject. Kate Beckinsale does awesome and in the movie. Loking forward to watch the rest of the movies in the series.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|A look at the realistic hard life of running moonshine back in the \\"good ol' days\\".  Tom Hardy was wonderful (as usual) and Guy Pearce played the \\"bad\\" good guy so well. Based on a true story...what a way to make a family living!!
B000TTRGUE|5.0|It is a very functional microphone, sounds great and crystallized, makes little difference to the other professional microphones, an alternative to many more expensive microphones
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|It has one great song but it is an addicting tune and the album was on sale. So it was a pretty good deal.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It is such a pleasure to be able to find your way around by common sense. The graphics are clean. When you need to find something or go somewhere you can actually see what you are doing. The last game I tried (which I dumped before finishing it) didn't respond half the time and when I used a hint I still couldn't make out the object. Hint: Macchu Puccini. This game is the exact opposite. It is not out to frustrate you for the neck of it but to engage you.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|You won't be sorry if you buy this SRK knife from Cold Steel. It has an amazing feel to it and is very well balanced. I love it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Three friends and I watched each season at 3 different times. We could not stop during a season.  We all agree that Matthew should NOT die.  It should be just a dream.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|This show has everything -- interesting, well-rounded characters, fine acting, a great script, love and sex, hate and revenge, beautiful costuming and great scenery. You Go Lucretzia!
B0067R0APK|3.0|Why fix something that's not broke. Thanks for nothing! I always need to waste my money. Next I will go with Weather Watch!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Even though this is a novel; it is a very impressive one!  It is so easy to judge by appearances and actions! So often we do not even attempt to put any thought into our jugdements. This book tells a story to make us look further into what is causing a person's thoughts and actions with more understanding and concern.  A thought provoking book!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|The history channel got it right.  Hopefully they will have future programs on this &#34;historical fiction narrative&#34;; Say feudal Japan.
B00A17AD36|5.0|Love the Weeknd, best album I ever purchased! Very talented singer, hope to hear more from him.  Every song on this album is good, I listen morning, at work and when I go to sleep.  Would love to see in person!
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|Recently, several pop singers from across the pond have been making it in the US. Charli fits right in with Ellie Goulding, Marina & Diamonds, Cher Lloyd, and Jessie J. In fact, often she sounds like a hybrid mix of all of them. Her voice isn't quite as melodic as Ellie, as quirky as Marina, as accessible as Cher, or as technically excellent as Jessie---but still Charli stands out.<br /><br />The first song I heard by Charli, \\"You (Ha Ha Ha),\\" expertly samples one of my favorite songs, \\"You\\" by Gold Panda. This is what initially piqued my interest. But then I realized Charli has this twisted little edge that makes her much more mysterious than any of the above artists and adds a layer of needed complexity to solid/enjoyable but not astounding dance/pop music. It's hard to describe--it's not her lyrics as much as the choices she makes when she sings. At times I imagine an evil clown is singing, at times I see a femme fatale, at times I hear the barely legal and still vulnerable but fun Charli come out, but at the end of the day Charli simply owns each song. She just posses such confidence that she's unafraid to play around with both her voice as well as music styles. And she also has a natural swagger that enables her to pull off even some of the stranger choices on the album.<br /><br />As for music styles on this album--everything is in the range of pop/dance music, but is actually quite fresh sounding even in a music market full of people who are attempting similar things. It's more subtle and hypnotic than most mainstream music--yet much more hard-hitting and catchy than a lot of indie pop/synth groups. Also, you might not realize this, but Charli both wrote as well as was featured on the recent Icona Pop hit, \\"I Love It.\\"<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is simply a great pop record that offers something different and there is no doubt that Charli is one to be watched. I would highly recommend it to anyone who are fans of the singers previously mentioned or even artists like Santogold. Normally I scoff at people who try to predict the next big thing, but I can't help but hear Charli and think---this is the future. She's got the skills, confidence and most importantly the determination to stand out.<br /><br />**Since buying this album, \\"What I Like\\" has been on constant repeat in my car, at my desk at work, in my head. It's got a 90s chill groove dressed up with a 00s auto-tuned chorus that is unbelievably catchy.r even artists like Santogold.

031286504X|5.0|If you're tired of hearing about Twilight and other overrated thrillers- I urge you read this novel. You will thank yourself later for it.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|A little heavy on the nudity but the rest of the shows are incredible.  I am hooked. The acting is the best.
B002S45V32|5.0|One of the best of the 80's movies!! Can watch it over and over. Even turned my daughter on to the 80's!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Never know what is going to happen next. So do not get hooked on any single character. It looks like they are all subject to the big D.
0062015176|2.0|I read \\"Howl\\" as a high school student, and thought it would be nice for my students to have the experience, in a more appealing format; the graphic novel.<br /><br />I guess it had been a while since I read the poem, or maybe I was being naive?  I certainly didn't anticipate what some of the language of the poem might look like in picture form.  Boy am I glad I screen the books before I put them in my classroom library!!!!!<br /><br />This is not meant for a classroom, even with mature high school students... This one is staying on my personal bookshelf: )
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Although I was disappointed that I need to spend $25 to fix a technical design flaw with her Kindle, I am please so far with the new plug and adapter that was designed to overcome the flaw in the charging units on her Kindle Fire.  I recommend to anyone out there to try these adapters before disposing of their Kindle.  We've had them for a week and so far so good.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|The movie is good bat the picture is so dark looks like those moves that people sell on the street ..like its record with regular camera in the movie theater ...
B008AX1HD8|5.0|I love this genre by Jo Nesbo and it doesn't disappoint. The Australian setting was intriguing and made the characters all the more believable and interesting.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it its nice to know how to dress for work I work at a lumber yard and it lets me know when I can where my shorts ;-)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read the reviews and skipped on this book several times.  Really positive reviews without any dissent worry me, there is always some wack job that doesn't like a book.  Like &#34;I don't normally read SyFy and this book is why&#34; or something to that affect.  So I finally took a chance, and found that this is a great book.  There are lots of technical ins and outs, but they are written so I didn't feel to stupid.  The book flowed and I had three great laugh out loud moments.  Those three laughs made me love this book.  Great job.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The book is the first thing that I got for my new Kendle. It has been used for a good cause.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I love this movie and the Blu-Ray was at a price I just couldn't pass it. I recommend it to all Disney/Pixar lovers!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book<br />My first Stephen king book ever never a slow moment  can't wait for his next book what an imagination
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I bought this because it was just so much better priced than within Australia. And my rabbit and I have just had hours of fun with those little hopping eggs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER. IT'S BETTER THAN TEMPLE RUN BECAUSE YOU DONT TURN IT HAS BETTER ANIMATION AND JUST FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Have two young babies and a career. I have a 21 month old + a 6 month old.  No time to drive to gym.  This workout is perfect for me, I do it in the morning before the kiddos wake up. You blink and its over! 20 hardcore minutes a day for 2.5 weeks ....I'm already in my pre baby jeans that I never thought would button again.  I already purchased the new version. You can mix up your workouts so it doesn't get boring.  Seriously,  watch your carbs and do these 20 min workouts and you WILL lose weight - fast!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|who has heard of a bingo where you're on Facebook and when you win you lose. so you shouldn't get this.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This is a very good PDF reader for what I want to use it for, mostly for reading role playing game books. It has a feature where you can read one column at a time on two column pages with the column filling the entire screen and at a comfortable reading zoom level. Perfect for reading rpg books
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book was recommended to me from goodreads.com,  because of other books I have read.  Who would I recommend this book for,  I'm not really sure... Older teen I guess because of sexual reverence.  It read like a teen book,  which is why I didn't give it a 5 stars.  I liked it enough to read the next book in the series, but the second one is losing my interest.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I love this movie.  I've seen many versions of this story.  This one is very powerful.  The music really adds depth to the portrayal of the story.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I didn't understand it.....and I failed my quiz on it.....it was a good book though...ready to watch the movie...4 stars
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I love this music.  I have played this CD in my car everyday to and from work since I received the CD. (several weeks) It's wonderful!
B0099G7KDQ|3.0|I loved Sigh No More, and thought I would also love Babel...but for me, it is not so genuine and heartfelt as Sigh No More. I just prefer the former to the latter.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|The movie did a great job of portraying the dynamics of his cabinet and Sally Fields gave a fantastic role as Mrs. Lincoln  watching it on the smart tv was a challenge as the film was so dark it was hard to see at times as well as hard hear in cabinet scenes.  If I had watched at the movie theater I would probably rate it higher
030758836X|2.0|This novel has two of the least appealing protagonists it is ever been my misfortune to encounter. It is an excellent mystery and well written but I couldn't get past my distaste for the main characters. By the time I got to the end of the book I didn't care what became of either of them because their behaviour and actions were so horrible. That is a very sad commentary on a novel. I know it shows up on a lot of reading lists but I can't recommend it to anyone.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The 4-disc set is amazing. The extras and added scenes really make this stand out. I recommend this to any Tolkien fan.
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie was OK from an action/adventure point of view.  Character relationships were not well developed.  Then ending seemed to scream &#34;the book ties this up much better&#34;.  I DID NOT read the book, so take the following with that in mind if you did.  At a few places in the movie I had the definite, conscious thought &#34;the book must have had more detail&#34; or &#34;the book must have been different here&#34;.  Perhaps not, in which case I don't feel bad about missing the book.  All in all, the tension was managed well enough to keep me engaged.
1476715904|5.0|At first, I wasn't so sure why this book was rated so great.  It only took a short time to realize why.  I love this book, the story, everything.  One of my favorite reads.  Highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|3.0|As with most things, the ending is what makes something great or not.  Think about it.  A movie (bad ending, you'll never remember the movie), a person(great life, one mistake at end and you never remember the good). This was a great read up until the end. I was very disappointed.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This is by far my favorite TV Series. It is so addicting! Best show ever, and an amazing story line!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great Book, keeps you involved, by the way it ended, almost leads you to believe there could be a 2nd book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|a story that teaches us the history of the beguining of the XX Century in an absolutely thrilling way that grabbs us in it!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I was looking for a new series to read after finishing wheel of time. The whole Sword of Truth series so far has been very enjoyable. Terry Goodkind has a great imagination and an enjoyable writing style. I have been captivated with these books.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is an absolutely thrilling story that teaches us the XX Century history, grabbing us in the Reading in a way we can't stop until it ends.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|DEFENDING JACOB WAS ONE OF THOSE STORYLINES YOU CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS WAS VERY BELIEVABLE. WHEN YOU THOUGHT THAT THE  BOOK COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER THE ENDING SURPRISES YOU.
B005VTGB0S|5.0|We have one for our kindle fire and like it so much that we bought a second one for out tablet.
B00BZXM3VA|5.0|Sorry for the corny title.  Straight through, this album is great.  I was a little bit worried that nothing would be able to compare to Smoke Ring For My Halo, but my worrying was in vain.  I'm still getting the lay of the land on this one but I can already tell it will be in rotation for a long time.
B00C3V5TTQ|4.0|Was very pleasantly surprised.  A few of these bands from this era have gone on to produce new albums that have been subpar in my opinion(depeche mode comes to mind and I'm a big dm fan).  I easily like 5 songs on this album which could easily have been on prior omd albums - nice and catchy, still with the great voice - gives me a nice nostalgic feeling for that great musical timeline.  Songs that stand out for me: metroland(keep singing telegraph at the beginning of this song), Night Cafe, Helen of Troy, Kissing the Machine and Dresden(actually don't really like the other filler stuff) but 5 good songs on an album is fine with me
B00AUA67GQ|3.0|I needed something to remind me of things to do.  I have not had a reason to use it as yet, but I'm sure it's what I needed.

B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It's enjoyable.  I've played it a few times and like it.  I don't like facebook, so I don't care playing against others, nor my high score.
B008602KQI|4.0|In as far as a movie made from a book, this is pretty decent. But without the background from the book, the movie loses a lot of depth. But that's to be expected, I guess.
B0083EY9EI|4.0|Definitely has a fresh pop sound...not quite like anything out there right now and that is good news to my ears
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I knew that it was going to be stupid funny but is was ok for laughter. I liked the part for the job interview.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I bought it because last summer while waiting all evening during one of my daughters' many swim meets I was sitting next to a woman who was reading it and she was laughing out loud.  This Spring the same thing happened to me while waiting at a softball practice---another mom was laughing out loud while reading this book.  So I went home and I bought it that night and because my kindle wasn't charged I read the entire book on the Kindle app on my iphone!  I just couldn't stop reading it.  It's hard to imagine that anyone wouldn't enjoy it---it's just really well written and extremely funny.  I could relate to so many parts of it.  Beyond that, it made me think about a number of things in my life and my parenting as well.  Totally loved it.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|taught a good lesson to kids and how family is very important. no one is good enough for daddy's little girl
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|An eye-opener of the autrocities taking place in North Korea.  I was not aware of so much cruelty going on in that nation.  Shin is an extremely brave man.  It breaks my heart that he has been through so much.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|very nice graphics, the end was well played, no one can kill batman, or can they......<br />it was one of the best movies I had seen lately
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|Works really well. No problems, unlike the previous reader that I had which stopped working after a few months. I've had this reader for about a year now, and it still works as it's supposed to even though a spilled tea onto my laptop at one point.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|Ever since my friend got me into the series, i have been hooked! This season definitely did not disappoint, it was one of the best i've seen so far, and the Blu-ray quality made it even bettter!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|My book club chose this book for one of our monthly readings  I found it hard to put the book down.  If you love suspense stories you will love this one.  The ending took me by surprise.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|It was this season that first got me interested in Doctor Who, especially when my buddy showed me the Weeping Angels episodes! I'm very thankful to have this season!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I expected to not be a big fan.  Love that there is a  lot of humor involved in a touching movie.
B003R1B9MW|5.0|Outstanding on every level. It stays in the fairway through the entire film. It never gets in the rough and is steadily entertaining.  Knowing the true story only deepens the appreciation of the film which of course takes dramatic license, but in an acceptable manner.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|One of my favorite games of this type ever!  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!  Great fun for all ages<br />Squirrelmh
B000HF6ZR0|3.0|A script that is not up to talents of the cast, but is watchable every once every ten years...one more word required...there.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Let me say that I rarely watch network TV, as most of it is salacious garbage, including much of Mr. Lorre's stuff (&#34;2 1/2 Men&#34; for example).  By accident I saw this show one evening (my son was  waiting for something else on that channel) ...I wasn't hooked, but I was intrigued. A few weeks later I saw the first episode (&#34;Bran Hypothesis&#34;?  NOT the pilot) in which Leonard and Sheldon clean Penny's apartment in the middle of the night, while she is sleeping.  When she  wakes the next morning, and finds they've been in there... I won't spoil it, watch it yourself. (I howled.)  The pilot is almost as funny.<br /><br />This show is  a Contender for Greatness because over six seasons the producers have managed to make geeks, and science, interesting and funny.  The stories are realistic, and remain fresh.  In our area (Philadelphia)  &#34;Big Bang&#34; re-runs are shown on three separate channels at least ten times per week during prime time. The show is that good (and the rest of the junk is that bad).
B0064QNS62|3.0|Its a good throw back game kind of reminded me of playing in arcades back when they still existed but having on a kindle fire isn't the best. Don't get me wrong its a good game, but the controls on it are a little to small to be playing on but all in all i rate about 3 stars
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I thought when my Kindle fire was stolen that I would not be able to read my books. with this app for my android, I can read just like on a real kindle. Thanks Amazon.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|What a story! I felt as the reader that I knew the truth,but I wasn't absolutely sure.  I was on the edge of my seat until I found out how the \\"child\\" was handled. I had hoped help would've been chosen of another type.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Very interactive n fun. Always something you can be doing in your zoo. Love that you rescue the animals from the wild and bring them back to your zoo and can breed the animals to create little families
B004LP3AYI|5.0|It is a little over the top, but nothing new to Terry Goodkind readers.  The characters are extremely well developed and I spent a large portion of the book angry at the bad guys and crying over stuff happening to the good guys.  I like the worlds that Terry creates and his system of magic.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book came highly recommended to me.  At first it seemed rather ordinary but then the drama kicked in.  I couldn't put it down at that point and couldn't stop thinking about it.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I loved the movie and everyone's singing.  It's one of my all time favorite movies.  I watch it a lot.
B00AFEY354|5.0|&#34;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34; was like taking a trip back in time to my teenage years when I would consistently watch, daydream and relate with a John Hughes movie. My daughter and I watched this movie together and within the first twenty minutes were absolutely in love. We laughed and cried then talked about the movie after the credits finished rolling. For us this movie was more of an emotional experience, me looking back at my teen years, and she as she is experiencing life and high school right now. This is not to say it's a perfect movie, but it's a good movie, one we've re-watched and will watch again. I would highly recommend watching the commentary track with the director and cast, if you're into that sort of thing, it's quite hilarious and insightful to the making of the film. My daughter recommends reading the novel, which accompanied this movie as a gift. She read through it in a few days and it has now been passed to the hands of at least two of her friends.
039472903X|5.0|From: [...]<br /><br />If we are talking old school, I'm going back in time for this one. Ogilvy on Advertising was mandatory reading when I worked at Ogilvy and Mather in the late 80s, and it is still the best intro to the basic theories of advertising. Background on layout? Copywriting? Market Research? Check, check and check. And the ads from the 60s are just too groovy for words.
1565234243|4.0|While I have yet to go to the workshop with it, reading through it has given me much help.  Look forward to applying it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This file explorer is really easy to use.  Navigation is simple.  What more can you ask for?  If you need to see files in your Kindle, this is a great little app.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The Hobbit is yet another Peter Jackson film that lives up and even exceeds the Tolkien books. The film is clever and fun and focuses on Bilbo, Gandalf and13 dwarves of middle earth. While many people were upset by Jackson's decision to take one small book and make it into a trilogy of films, it ended up being a great first installment. Jackson also pulled source material from Tolkien's The Silmarillion to add on mythology and history. Overall a must see movie.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|I didn't realize until Delta Machine came out how so many people compare most Depeche Mode albums to Violator.  This was curious to me, since DM hasn't made an album like Violator since...well...Violator.  Nothing was quite like that album, before or after its release.  So to expect a danceable and hook-laden album from these boys, especially since the last two, is pretty unrealistic in my opinion.  Instead, Delta Machine continues the trend that started with Playing the Angel and continued with Sounds of the Universe.  A dark, electronic and brooding sound, only now it's even less accessible.  Martin Gore and producer Ben Hillier seem to have actively tried to make this album sound as little pop as possible.  This is NOT a bad thing.<br /><br />The 17 tracks on this deluxe edition are quite good.  But they most likely won't grab you upon first listen.  Heck, they might not grab you upon the first five listens.  But when they do, you'll appreciate this new direction completely.  The instrumentation is fantastic, giving the listener an atmospheric and introspective feel, while synth effects swirl in and out.  This is most evident in \\"My Little Universe\\", which is the most abstract song on this record, bringing forth a reminiscing of Radiohead and Bjork.  Other tracks just rock along without any real hooks, but providing great impact nonetheless.  \\"Soft Touch / Raw Nerve\\", \\"Should Be Higher\\", \\"Long Time Lie\\" and the beautiful \\"Always\\" are great examples of this.  Then you have the electronica-fused bluesy songs such as \\"Angel\\", \\"Slow\\" and \\"Goodbye\\" which provide some familiar Depeche Mode sounds.  It's no wonder that \\"Heaven\\" and \\"Soothe My Soul\\" were selected as singles, as they are probably the most radio-friendly songs on the album.  \\"Heaven\\" is a soulful ballad with minimal production that fits nicely alongside classics like \\"Precious\\" and \\"Home\\", while \\"Soothe My Soul\\" reminds of an updated version of \\"I Feel You\\".<br /><br />This is an album that above all showsthat Depeche Mode is more relevant than ever.  It stands proudly alongside their post-Ultra records as one of the best.  It is an album that rewards the listener with repeated plays.  I'm very curious how this will sound live on their Delta Machine World Tour (to which I already bought tickets!).
B000VZLL02|4.0|I personally think this album is another very strong effort. Although there are a couple tracks im not not crazy about.Ace finally steps up to the mic and as far as im concerned has the stand out track on the disc. All 4 members not only contribute with their playing but also with their voices. Great music done by a band that never claimed to be great musicians!!!
B008Y5OWSO|4.0|It is as most have said: Beautifully filmed (5star material) , but the pacing, plotting, and sadly, editing....3star, max.<br /><br />So it gets a four; nothing to shrug at, especially since with some tweaking, I cannot exactly say how ---it could have been one of the very best.<br /><br />Worth watching, no doubt. Cinematography conveys that moment in Time as I have never seen so thoroughly in any other film.
B00124FQCK|4.0|No, its not ozzy. No its not Dio.It its however an awesome effort from the band that started it all.Ive had it for years and still listen to it regularly. I would love for this line-up to give us another dose of great music (nothing against Tony Martin at all, love that stuff too) !!!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I'm captivated by this series right now. I better understand how [TV] lawyers think, and am entertained all at once. Watching one episode after another allows for continuity that I could not get with commercials and football delays and time changes. Excellent series.
B0026S98TS|5.0|This is one of those disc i consider to be a go to cd. I enjoy it in its entirety. Unfortunately it will be the last studio effort we get from RJD. Atleast the last we&#34;ll hear from him is one of the best disc&#34;s i&#34;ve heard in a long time!!!!
1572814349|5.0|The reviews were SO good, and the price SO low, I was suspicious that maybe the seller was finessing their online appearance.  Nope.  This is a deck I'm so proud to use.  It didn't take long to become comfortable with the spread because she didn't try to do anything weird and rename/re-order the cards (a mistake imho).  Beautiful.  If you don't have this deck, take advantage of this asap!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Peter Jackson returns as the director of the prequel to The Lord of The Rings trilogy, and once again does a fantastic job. The cinematography and special effects are second to none and the story is wonderful, as most of you that have read &#34;The Hobbit&#34; already know. I love the decision to tell the story through three films instead of one. It allows the film to focus on more important areas of the story and add detail to parts of the book that would have otherwise been left out. I bought the 3-D version and it is awesome! I mean it really is purely spectacular! I watched it on a 55&#34; 1080P 3-D Vizio H.D.T.V. and the picture and 3-D effects are totally out of this world! Can't wait for the next film to come out, and also hoping that they will re-release The Lord of The Rings trilogy in a Blu-Ray 3-D form. Overall, two thumbs up! 10 out of 10!
1607066017|5.0|But I did!!! I really didn't think this book would live up to all the hype I've seen online. BKV is hit or miss with me.Fiona Staples always puts out top notch work though. I had this in my Amaz on cart for a long time, but kept moving it to the 'save for layer's section. Since I had to have surgery and was stuck in bed for 2 months I needed something to read. I decided to pull the trigger. Vaughn does a great job grabbing you and pulling you into the story of these characters who are from warring planets and have fallen in love. They have a baby and are on the run from both of their planets. The worlds the Vaughn and Staples have created are amazing. This book is definitely not for kids. If you want a fun read, but something geared towards adults, check this out. You won't be disappointed.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I needed a new cable for my Kindle Fire HD as I misplaced the original one and this fit the bill exactly.
B00417HV0U|5.0|A fan since Swoon, I know Paddy's work can be an acquired taste. I understand what it feels like to experience disappointment in a Sprout album. Andromeda Heights did not sit well with me after a few listens and I gave up hope on future albums. But I was blown away by the remastered Steve McQueen (especially the amazing acoustic versions), and thrilled to discover that this new album was among Paddy's best work. Steve McQueen/Two Wheels Good was brilliant and Jordan: The Comeback a work of pure genius. This new effort carries on that tradition ... a consistently accessible collection by a confident songwriter at the peak of his game. Please ignore the negative reviews here. These tracks may technically be \\"home-recorded,\\" but only an audio engineer could quibble over such polished recordings ... these are not demos. The religious lyrics are no different than those at the end of Jordan and do not prosthelytize. But here's an idea ... listen to the audio clips above and make up your own mind! That's how I knew this was a must-have album.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Nexus 4. There's a keypad but no way to place the objects you create. If you can't get your game to work properly on stock android flagship devices you're doing something wrong?
B001QFZADA|5.0|This is a book that after you read seems really obvious and simple but yet it opens your eyes.  I felt it really helped me understand people responses to me and how to help my interactions with people.
B002WJI63A|5.0|We got princess peach to go with my daughters other mario toys. She loves her, carries her around, plays with her. Seems to be well made. Her hair looks a little funny in the back but I can't complain too much because of the great price.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is historical and well-acted, telling a story of bravery under almost impossible condictions. Good for all ages, child to any adult.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Not able to sign in. Not all info accessable because of it. Deleted in hopes of finding a better app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this lil game. makes me miss a horse I had when I was young... movement of body so real and natural looking wow
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Read the book and the film followed the book very well. Really enjoyed it. Great telling of a necessary event in history.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I'm excited and hopeful that this album will continue to unite and inspire dance music. Thanks for the random access memories Daft Punk.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I like it better on my kindle than my phone cuz it's easier to draw on. I wish you could have more than one game with each person.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I cannot put it down, it's very addictive. The graphics and pictures are beautiful. I enjoy building up the village I even download this game on my iPhone. No regrets paying the $1&middot;99 it's worth the price and more. Don't feel left out get it, you won't regret it.
B008602KQI|4.0|i liked this movie, good actors and a good drama, definately a watch again. Had alot of action and kept you watchin never boring
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I thought this would be a better movie than it was but it was kind of boring and alot of harsh cus words no plot
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I feel like Rothfuss really sunk into his element here. The story is a real page-turner, and all the fantastic elements are introduced in such a natural way that the whole thing is more believable than usual within the standard suspension-of-disbelief state that one needs to asopt while reading fantasy. I am anxiously awaiting the third novel in the series.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I have known for sometime that I needed to do a real hardware based color calibration but had put it off until I purchased a second monitor and when seen side by side they were clearly very different. I shopped around and decided the ColorMunki Display was a good compromise price-wise to meet my needs.<br /><br />Setting up and using the ColorMunki could not have been easier. From the box to a working device in about ten minutes. I downloaded the most up-to-date software from the xRite web site (the supplied disk was not current) and was ready to go. First my primary monitor which too my eye was far to yellow. At the end, when comparing before and after images, there was not too much difference. On to the secondary monitor which was way too dark, but was at the brightest manual setting. After finishing that monitor a clear difference was apparent. But (yes, there is a &#34;but&#34;) the two monitors are still not visually the same. I suppose because they are different models.<br /><br />The ColorMunki software is easy to use and requires no special knowledge of color. It handled my two monitors easily, creating a separate profile for each, which were automatically set to the default profile.<br /><br />While I am not sure which monitor to believe, I will run some test prints and see which matches best. I do feel much better that I have done the calibration. The Colormunki Display is a good value.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loved it and couldn't put it down.  I really want to read it again with the movie coming out. Great
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|my niece loved this game. she had a great time playing it. she is 7 years old and it was a little hard for her, but it she liked it a lot.
B00BU8QOII|5.0|I found this movie to be gripping and beautifully acted!  I thought that Tom Holland and Naomi Watts were particularly great in their roles.  I definitely recommend this movie.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Program is a refined mystery show as opposed to the regular mysteries (we called them M&Ms murder and mayhem).  Also have enjoyed the interaction between Holmes and Watson.  Fun watching their relationship evolve.
0446580848|4.0|John Cory and Kate Mayfield go to Yemen to hunt down the perpetrators of the USS Cole bombing.<br /><br />Ok, the plot is not as simple as that, and the end definitely leaves room for expansion.  DeMille creates another bad guy as well as introducing two new chaotically aligned characters working for the state department and the CIA.  The story is well crafted and the details are correct as near as I can tell.  The only item  I really questioned was that the US embassy was having its worship service on Sunday.  Generally most church services occur on Friday (same as the muslims, it synchronized<br /> our work week that way).  DeMille's John Cory character is his usual over the top self, so if you're not familiar with him, this will literally be like a slap in the face.  He thinks, and says things in the most shocking manner...that's the character's persona.<br /><br />Cory also dishes out a lot of his philosophy on the middle east, which I find shared by a lot of us who have lived and worked in the middle east.  It's not that we don't like the arabs, its more that we refuse to make excuses or coddle them.  I've probably known several Yemeni while working in the middle east, but only one that I know for sure.  You don't always ask what someone's home town is...Hey, where ya from...Sanaa? Isn't that in Yemen?...nope didn't happen that much.  It  is always good to keep track of who the local arabs are, versus  the expat arabs.  Locals pull a lot more political power and can make your life miserable if you piss them off.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|What's there to say that hasn't been said? This show is unbelievable and Amazon prime HD produces high quality on the go on on the computer.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|If our purpose in being here is to learn lessons and grow from them, then Nikki learned several, as documented in this book.<br /><br />With all the griping we do about negativity in the media, here is a very positive and uplifting story.<br /><br />Here we have a celebrity who is presenting the garbage he experienced (even if much of it was self-inflicted) at a time when he was \\"the king of the world\\", yet made up his mind to live. He learned. He grew.<br /><br />Even many of the people around him learned and grew as well.<br /><br />We should have been reading Nikki's epitaph sometime in the late '80s/early 90s, but he survived and is thriving.<br /><br />His story is important because he went through things that are not unique in our culture. And he learned from them and made up his mind to live.<br /><br />I grew up in the '80s and was (and still am) a huge Motley Crue fan. I am now an even bigger fan of the band, for their sheer perseverance.<br /><br />I am an even greater admirer of Nikki Sixx, for his strength and ability to realize his mistakes, own them, grow and learn.<br /><br />Most of us can't seem to do that, even with petty things, on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Regarding the Kindle version - there are many typos and similar mistakes. Apparently the folks at MTV Publishing need to learn how to read.
B000FA675C|3.0|First things first, I am a Christian.  I remember the controversy surrounding the book when it initially came out.  I read a synopsis online later on and didnt give it very much more thought.  A few weeks ago when I saw it was being offered free for the Kindle version, I grabbed it.  After reading it I felt like I should post a review.  First of all, the forward makes it clear it is a work of fiction.  Although Dan Brown claims the Priory was a real group history is unclear on that point.  Some believe the paperwork that was found that speaks of it was part of a larger farcical document.  We will probably never know.  Now let me say. I don't believe Jesus fathered children during his time on earth.  I doubt He engaged in sexual activity either.  So instead of hyperventilating about the specutative at best parts of the narrative I instead enjoyed the way Brown pulled all the threads together.  From the perspective of a reader who enjoys the likes of James Rollins and Steve Berry, I thought the author did a nice job.  My faith still holds, my beliefs are unchanged.  I simply enjoyed a fast moving story where disparate threads were neatly tied together by the conclusion.  If you approach it from that direction, not as an explosive uncovering of real history that was covered up, I think it is worth a read.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie to be as good as it was.  It held my interest right up to the end and left me wanting more (I'll be looking for a sequel).
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I like this movie. It takes a look at the relationship between a widowed father and his only daughter. Clint is a baseball scout with a successful daughter who longs for a closer relationship with her emotionally distant father. This is really a 3 and a half star movie for me but definitely recommend it. I expected to see more baseball scenes though.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I did not consider this the best of Disney movies, but it was interesting.  Perhaps a bit &#34;dark&#34; for younger kids.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I dont normally like movies like this, but thought this was good and made you feel what was happening at the time this movie was set in. History buffs and your normal silver screen enthusiust alike will like this.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series is THE BEST!  I would watch it for Maggie Smith alone, but the other characters (particularly the downstairs group) are so richly drawn that you can't help but love them all (well almost all).  If you want to lose yourself in another era and culture, this is the series you want to watch.
B00BSBVLF8|1.0|When saw saw Cirque live, I was absolutely mesmerized and surprised at my attraction to this. The movie however did nothing for me. I expected it to have more dialogue that carried us through a fantasy. It was all cirque just on TV. I loved it live and had little interest on TV.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I really empathized with Harold who takes off one afternoon to post a letter and just keeps walking on a pilgrimage to help an old friend.  The story covers his journey, the people he meets, his wife's reaction and his own personal journey of discovery.  It is not soppy or chocolate box, but a warm, lovely story full of believable characters.  Highly recommended.
B00B22IJXK|1.0|This app does nothing as to what it suggests that it does on the app description and especially the screen shots. There's no way it can come close to the blending effect it shows in the shot of the woman. It's just crude tools to draw and that's pretty much about it on the artistic side. I didn't even bother with the memes and other functions. Will delete as soon as the review is done!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This won't be a review as much as it will be an explanation as to why the critics are wrong.<br /><br />Critics,  Peter Jackson expanded this into THREE MOVIES!!  Did you actually come into this expecting to see \\"The Hobbit\\" alone?  Well if you did,  that was a mistake.  When I first saw this in theaters I too was doing the whole,  \\"That's not how they did it in the book!  That's different!  I don't like different!\\"  But then I remembered how much of Middle Earth PJ was planning to put into this,  so I forced myself to stop looking for mistakes and judge the movie for what it is.  And you know what?  Not only did I enjoy the movie,  but I wanted more.<br /><br />I know a lot of you think that expanding the movie was just a money grab,  but I think you're forgetting something. That Something being that Peter Jackson is GEEK.  100%,  unadulterated Geek.  Can you guess the movies target audience?  If you guessed \\"Geeks\\",  give yourself a cookie.  I guarantee you that had The Hobbit been created BEFORE the Lord of The Rings trilogy,  we would have had a more \\"faithful\\" adaptation. I will agree that he made an error in making LOTR first.  It set the bar far too high,  and the Hobbit,  while wonderful all on its own,  could not rise to the challenge of satisfying an army of salivating Tolkien geeks.  It just couldn't  It would only serve to whet their appetites.<br /><br />Many also criticize the tone of the movie,  or rather the lack of  steadiness of it.  That's one of the few things that stayed true the book!!  Tolkien himself made the book with light hearted, childish and immature moments,  and then threw in some pretty mature,  scary,  sad,  even gruesome moments.  I remember being taken off guard the first time I read it and didn't know what to think.  But I believe it's one of the things that made The Hobbit such a classic in the first place.<br /><br />All that said,  I will admit that this movie is flawed and I didn't appreciate all the changes,  such as tweakingthe Troll scene,  how Thorin was so whiny,  or  the fact that their mission changed from simple greed to the more noble \\"taking back the homeland\\" cliché.  But through it all the spirit of The Hobbit stayed the same,  and I loved every minute of it.  I can't wait for the Desolation of Smaug!!!<br /><br />---------<br />edit:  Just showed this movie to my four hyper-active no attention span nieces and nephews,  Ages 11-6 years old.  Not only did they sit through it,  but the 10 year old said \\"It's the best show I ever saw!\\"  I was not expecting that.  I guess this movie reaches a larger demographic then I originally thought!
B009AMANH4|5.0|I was impressed with the historical information brought to light on the amendment 13 that brought slavery to an end and brought the vote to more Americans.  Daniel Day-Lewis gave a profound portrayal of Lincoln and made the movie come to life.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Great read!  Quick paced and exciting.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a thriller.  I enjoyed how the characters seemed so real.  Not &#34;made for TV.&#34;
B004XUMMFE|5.0|One of my favorite shows of all time.  Great writing and acting.  Was crushed when<br />it got canned so young in its life.  Movie that's based on the series is excellent as well.  &#34;I'm a leaf on the wind&#34;
B007H1HQW0|4.0|I would recommend this product to a patient people! This product does work. Watch youtube videos for extra help. I give this product a 4 because it is not easy to keep steady to make ONE perfect score line.<br /><br />This is what works for me after much research:<br />-Score the line ONCE around<br />-Rotate bottle over a (tea candle) until you see a black line over the score you have made<br />-Dunk in cold water<br /><br />**have many bottles to practice on!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a pretty good app it helps out slot. The only thing is I wish it would save battery life a little longer. I use my kindle slot so I know that's part of the reason. Over all awesome.<br /><br />Thank you (:

B00785P2QC|5.0|It's addicting but to progress in the game you have to have investments, and the fastest way to get investments is to give free advertisement to the creators by posting all your achievements, or by purchasing them with real money. Pretty sneaky G 5 entertainment.

B00ADGSIRS|4.0|Let me state upfront that I am a life-long fan of Kraftwerk. Yet for whatever reason I have not purchased either of Karl Bartos' previous two albums (1998's Electric Music and 2003's Communication). But when I saw that his latest album would feature/is based on musical ideas and snippets from the past, I couldn't resist and I ordered the album, sound unheard. Am I glad I did!<br /><br />\\"Off the Record\\" (12 tracks; 40 min.) starts off with a very strong \\"Atomium\\" (and as I grew up in Belgium, I whole-heartedly agree with Bartos sentiment that it is \\"one of the most emblematic buildings in the world\\"). It is followed by \\"Nachtfarht\\", one of the songs with a strong Kraftwerk-undercurrent to it (it reminds of \\"Europe Endless\\"). \\"Without A Trace of Emotion\\" finds Bartos having a conversation with a \\"showroom dummy\\". \\"The Binary Code\\" is a short instrumental. \\"Music Ex Machina\\" is another key track and which reminded me immediately of the Human League, more so than Kraftwerk. \\"The Tuning of the World\\" was originally titled \\"Neon Piano\\" and in fact does sounds like an acoustic detour of \\"Neon Lights\\". \\"Vox Humana\\" is a joyful experiment of sounds. \\"Rhytmus\\" is THE key song on the album, with a strong undercurrent of Compute Love/Numbers. The closing track \\"Hausmusic\\" sounds like a Jean-Michel Jarre track.<br /><br />Several comments: first and foremost, while I had no preconceived notion as to what to expect when I ordered this, \\"Off the Record\\" is miles better than I could've ever hoped for. I find it enjoyable and surprisingly consistent from start fot finish, with hardly a weak moment on it. But wait, there is more! The album comes with an eye-pleasing 44 page booklet in which Bartos provides detailed information and insight on how (and when) each of the songs came about. For good measure, the lyrics of the songs are reprinted as well. Bottom line: it's now been 10 years since the last studio album of Kraftwerk and \\"Off the Record\\" fills the gap quite nicely. I can already state with confidence that this album will end up in my year-end \\"best of\\" albums list. If you are eager for more on Kraftwerk/Karl Bartos, you may want to check out the excellent book \\"Kraftwerk: Publikation\\" by David Buckley which was published last Fall (Bartos wrote the foreword and is quoted extensively in the book). Meanwhile, \\"Off the Record\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!eady state with confidence that this album will end up in my year-end \\"best of\\" albums list.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I'm 49 yrs old. I don't want ear buds or Dr. Dre giant headphones. These work.  Plus they stay on when I'm mowing, walking, watching tv, all those strenuous activities.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I have been a Jon Schmidt fan for SO long, even way before he was famous. I can remember listening to his cds almost 20 years ago.  Then Steve started working with him and now they have joined forces with more people and really made a name for themselves. I think they are amazing musicians and their music is fun, inspiring and emotional.  I am so excited that they have finally been rewarded for all their hard work and perseverance.  I can't wait for the next cd.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Pure energy fresh from the box.  Every song just grooves.  The usual amazing lyrics...a doctor who reference?  Wow. Just a perfect Clutch album.
B00555X8OA|5.0|The author, Dr. Kahneman, worked hard to earn this book's spot on the Bestseller list. It explains the developing science of decision making and lays the cognitive foundations that underlie behavioral economics. I would recommend it most highly to anyone who wants to understand how their mind works when they aren't looking at it.
B005544V6A|5.0|I just purchased the first season of suits two days ago and I am half through the season. The show is funny, fast moving, and smart. I recommend the show to anyone looking for a good laugh and smart writing.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I can't think of anything bad or wrong with this movie it was a great movie! I'm so glad that it continued! I just don't know any character except Gollum
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo was a great suspenseful movie. I was on the edge on my seat toward the end of the film. I recommend this movie for its great performs and subject matter,
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Chiklis definitely plays the role of a &#34;mob&#34; type cop great.<br />Support cast is great too.<br />Includes &#34;Boyd&#34; from &#34;Justified&#34;, which is the best drama on TV.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|this game downloaded and functioned fine on my first gen. kindle<br />I like games that you have to use your brain to figure it out - I had no trouble gaining access to each island even though I didn't manage to get all the badges (I am not even sure how to get them all as it is not well explained) nice little time killer when you need something to occupy yourself - worth a download
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|I guess I am not on top of things as I should be, but I saw this movie about 2 months ago and knew I had to make it one of my Christmas favorites.<br /><br />Arthur, the bumbling younger brother of Steven Claus just can't get a break...until one child is missed.  It is a hoot to see just what Arthur, GrandSanta and a wrapping elf named Bryony Shelfly go thru to accomplish their mission!<br /><br />You will absolutely love this movie!
B00C2I9U3G|5.0|I just finished reading this book and found it great.  The story involves two men, a \\"Rebbe\\", or Rabbi, and a \\"pastor\\".  The book lays out of how the Rebbe is dying and how he views his faith. It demonstrates how we must have faith, even when it's hard, and the reasons behind and how we demonstrate our faith.  The lessons to be drawn are: have faith (which is often difficult, especially in adversity); further, having faith is demonstrated by doing good to and by others, and the reason for doing so isn't to gain a reward, after this life, but because it is the right thing to do (and if done for this reason, that is, it's the right thing to do, the reward will come). At the end of the book, the Rebbe says, he tried to do good, while he was on Earth, and he asks: \\"What is my reward?\\"; God replies: \\"Reward? What reward? That's what you were supposed to do!\\" (p. 249, the paperback version). There are several passages in Proverbs in the Bible, too many to quote, that essentially say the same, or similar thing, and this book is a tale of how two men lived their lives, demonstrated their faith, and died according to their actions.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|love it. This is a really great CD I listen to it all the time. It is a Very relaxing CD
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother-in-law who needs to take some close-up photos for his little gadgets. Here is his comment, \\"an Apple-Grade Merchandise, nicely-packed, well-designed item...\\"
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this for my daughter and she is totally addicted! I have to take her android away to allow family and play time. I would give this a 5 star because anything she will play is an accomplishment because she has very little patience with any form of computer or tablet games. Also, it just fun to do when you have some time to kill!
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Each episode of &#34;Arrow&#34; is enjoyable from beginning to end. The story line is full  of suspense and mischief. &#34;Arrow&#34; is delivering poignant action.

B005GIS1WA|5.0|I was not entirely sold on this DVD, but the price was right and since I like parrots I bought it. Well, now I know where the &#34;angry birds&#34; originate. The music is upbeat and moving. The characters are hilarious. This was truly a diamond in hiding. Too bad it took me so long to decide to purchase this delightful movie.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|poor quality controller. the left analog stick wasn't installed correctly and couldn't register the movement of the stick. it was pretty irritating, and i ended up just getting another DS3 controller for my PS3. Might as well stick with the originals that are proven to be 100% compatible.
B0056TYT66|3.0|I received this unit well packed, upon installation, I found that the drivers that came with the unit did not work for the USB 3.0 to function. However Windows 7 did auto detect the SATA Drivers for the 6gb/s hard drive, I was able to find the USB drivers on the Transcend website, I later removed the card to do some other upgrades, when removing the card please take great care not to thumb the 2 filtering capacitors at the USB Outputs, One of the surface mounted Caps, broke off the board as they where not properly glued during the manufacturing process, I as an electronic tech, have repaired this damage and glued the 2, 10cent replacement parts in place, I hope in the future that Transcend will spend a tiny bit of $ to glue the fragile parts to the board.<br />However for the layman to have this happen it becomes a problem, So please be careful not to press on the 2 silver capacitors  they will break off the board leaving the adapter card useless on the USB Outputs.
B00BHAT7LU|5.0|This is a very well-made, well-acted, exciting<br />film with breathtaking locations. My only complaint<br />is that it is sometimes so gory I have to close my<br />eyes and miss some key plot points.<br /><br />However, there are so many characters I often lose track<br />of who is who. Many of the men look the same to me in<br />armor. And even when I know their name I have to<br />google them to see who exactly they're related to. But<br />this is not a fault of HBO. When reading the books I<br />often had to refer to the appendix for the same reason.<br /><br />Is it just me? Can anyone offer any suggestions?
B000LX00RY|5.0|Awesome movie. What else needs to be said. Meryl, as always, delivers a well-acted believable role. You actually believe she lives this life.<br /><br />Funny, engaging, and all around entertaining movie.
145210655X|5.0|Awesome book! The illustration is great and this is really an awesome book for a little star wars fan! I would recommend this book
B005TBN04S|1.0|this is b.s, first off i would like to say that iam a big fan of the hang over movies...but i purchased this video via amazon instant video and now im getting a notification that due to licensing i am unable to watch the video that i 'own' online? waste of money! why sell the product if you didnt even have the license to sell it in the first place? RIP OFF! DISAPPOINTED
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Very replay able and pumps you up to do everyday chores in an epic fashion. I would recommend to my friends.
B003B02O14|5.0|I won't give away the plot, but Grisham always hands you surprises!  I do like a Grisham novel, although I'd be the first to admit he had some stinkers.  I hated &#34;Playing for  Pizza&#34;.  It really wasn't up to his form.  And I couldn't even get the courage to read &#34;The Innocent Man&#34;.  But, having said that, when Grisham is good, he is the best!  I am very fond of his new young adult series: &#34;Theodore Boone, Kid Lawyer&#34;.  Grisham novels are what the critics call Page Turners, and I love to be so involved with a book that I can't wait to find time to read in any given day!
B005THRU0C|5.0|Debut album '+' showcases Ed's knack for melodic acoustic tracks and catchy yet original lyrics. It's a solid album that establishes Ed as a mainstream artist who still has his own style. Lovely acoustic tracks, yet plenty of upbeat tunes to balance out the album.
B009AMANBA|5.0|love it going to watch it again and again Daniel Day-Lewis very good as Lincoln should be movie of the year
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|it is a simple concept but i had a little trouble figuring out some of the specifics. but i got the hang of it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Recommend to Science fiction and Fantasy readers.  Well written.  Looking forward to the next parts of the Saga.  Should not miss these books considering the price.
B009LGO88E|5.0|this is required for MH3U, no matter how much you can justify using the little screen dpad, this will be infinitely better. look at it as an investment too, MH4 is releasing in japan this summer, and the states will be seeing it hopefully by next years summer. many games are now making CPP compatibility, it is really how the system should have been build to begin with. no more claw hand,
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Although this story's plotline is really a bit scary at times, I love Kevin Bacon as an actor, and also James Purefoy - love watching their interaction in the show!!
B008220DGE|4.0|I had read much of the speculation about this film. Many people feel that it is a thinly veiled docudrama about the beginnings of Scientology. The actors in this film are all superb. Joaquin Phoenix is a tortured soul returning from the second World War. He was by turns a wild child but you can tell that for all the rebellious nature he exudes, he is relieved of all decisions in the service and comes to realize that it suits him. His mentor is played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman who as the pretentious leader of what he insists is not a cult but a revolutionary way of training people to think. Sound familiar? Amy Adams is the seemingly retiring no questions type but then she is not a women who tolerates indiscretion on the part of her husband. This could have been a movie about corporate America with Hoffman's character as the product. If this is not about Scientology and its beginning, it is a perfect example of how such influences can take over people's lives and not necessarily for the better. This is a cerebral movie but much of it is very beautifully shot and it makes you question everything.What I question was how this guy fleeced people out of so much money!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It is great for my son to use for his math homework.<br />Been using it for about a month<br />Would highly recommend.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is the perfect type of series to stream from Amazon - we watch one during dinner each night. No need to wait to get through reruns, commercials, etc.<br /><br />The acting is excellent. Both Olivias and both Walters are interesting and different enough to illustrate the effect of experience on shaping personalities. The two Astrids are so different that it is hard to believe they started out the same. Again, the actors are doing an excellent job.<br /><br />You definitely don't want to start with season 3 - this is one of those shows like Lost that needs to be watched more or less sequentially.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I have 4 boys ages 7 down to 1 1/2 and we have watched this moving 4 times in 2 weeks. It's a great story! I love that it brings out the childhood dreams, beliefs and innocence
0425221806|5.0|This is one of Dean Koontz's early books. It is one of his best.  It is not only a love story between two very interesting people, but a fascinating study of dog/human interaction.  There is a good study of animal genetic experimentation.  The results are not always pretty.<br /><br />The book is a real page turner with many twists and surprises.
0739378341|5.0|I hate the wait for the next one by Grisham. The clean language is wonderful in today's crude society. Thanks!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Post apocalyptic fiction is not my thing. It is usually too depressing. But I decided to read this on a friend's recommendation. I am so glad I sucked it up and read it. The pacing was great, the way important plot points spin out almost as an afterthought is great, the characters were multifaceted (even the villains). Great book. Looking forward to what he does next.
0525953728|5.0|I appreciate Mark and all he and his co-workers did! The &#34;60 minutes&#34; program encouraged me to read his book. I'm so glad I did!
B006QVRVJK|5.0|I love all four leads in this enigmatic, comedic/drama of a film, which was written as a play and is directed by one of my favorite directors, the great Roman Polanski. One married couple -- two affluent high rolling New Yorkers, Christoph Waltz and Kate Winslet -- visit another couple -- Jodie Foster and John Reilly -- who appear to be your average middle class duo. But here, nothing is as it appears. True to form, Romanski keeps the lens primarily in a single apartment. The cause of the meeting: one couple's son has recently hit the son of the other couple with a stick and knocks out two teeth... The parents meet to hash it out. I hate to use a cliche like \\"comedy of manners\\" but that is what this film is, and watching these four knock one another and roll around like pool balls, continually forming and breaking alliances is both amusing and intriguing. They are at each other's throats one moment, then laughing uproariously the next. Each time I watch it -- which is quite often, I just got it this week -- I learn something knew. Plus I was into Waltz, having recently seen Django.
B007VUCAVO|3.0|This is a fairly decent app that shows detailed battery information. However, it is difficult to get a meaningful response from customer service. I have been having some issues when attempting to charge the Fire HD (taking much longer than advertised when using the Amazon power adapter), so I thought I would use the Battery Pro option to 'calibrate' the battery. I received the error message:<br /><br /> &#34;Test was aborted because battery consumption was not detected&#34;.<br /><br />I sent two emails to the app customer service and the one response I received did not address the error message. I don't believe they understood the question due to language barriers. The only reason I purchased the app was to see if it could help resolve the charging issue, so I am disappointed that I cannot discuss the error message with the app developer.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love this series.  I most enjoy watching the whole season in a week or so.  Game of  Thrones, althought quite bloody, is intelligently done and doesn't treat us viewers like idiots (like many other TV series do on the regular channels).  I will definitely buy Season 2.  I also faithfully watch for any new series made on any of the paid channels that Amazon sells as they are better than most movies that are playing in the theaters.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|This is a must-read for all women. It is refreshingly honest about what it's like becoming and being a woman. If I ever have a daughter, I'd love to give this to her on her 13th birthday!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has so many obstacles. I never thought you went under ground. This is the best game to play!!!  P.S. thanks for making this game.
B0036SXQEA|3.0|This had to be the most vulgar movie I have watched with the number of \\"name\\" stars and character actors involved. But if you can get past the F bomb being dropped over 150 times it has many twist and turns in the plot
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I have never been a big fan of short stories, but these are causing me to rethink that.  Each story is absorbing in it's own way.<br />This is a wonderful book.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|This is a great series for those who love video about the ancient times. My only complaint is that the video stopped playing and I lost the third episode.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|I really enjoy the show but the background sounds are to loud and that makes it hard to hear the dialogue.
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|After a couple of years off the screen running California, The Governator returns in this action throwback to a time when Ahnold was king. Though the presence of Johnny Knoxville was a deterrent and made this film seem like a rehash of another movie done with the Rock (Walking Tall?), I found this to be quite enjoyable. The performance is solid, director delivers with a serviceable action story that's got a few clever one liners and everything you want from a Schwarzenegger film. Must have for action fans. Everyone else might want to watch the trailer on youtube and then rent it if they're still on the fence.
B00000IBRX|5.0|I was really amazed at how in depth and puzzling this movie was. I highly recommend it. Originally purchased in 2000, and very glad I did.
B00BEYYEE4|3.0|Broken City (2013) - Russell Crowe (Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind), Mark Wahlberg (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, The Fighter), Catherine Zeta-Jones (Chicago, Zorro), Jeffrey Wright (Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace), Kyle Chandler (Super 8, Friday Night Lights)<br /><br />This is a corruption drama. Mark Wahlberg plays a former cop turned private investigator hired by the Mayor of New York City (Crowe) to investigate the mayor's cheating wife (Zeta-Jones). It's a pretty standard story set against the backdrop of a mayoral race. It proceeds as you would expect - there are very few twists and turns in this paint by the numbers mystery. That said, is it a bad film? No. It's worth watching once - that said, I don't think this is a must have. Everyone gives a solid performance, though some come off a bit more hammy than others (Z-J/R.C. in their \\"dick measuring\\" contest scene). If you are a fan of Wahlberg and any of the actors listed, I recommend a rental.
0316228532|1.0|Rowling must have gotten tired of writing about love in the Harry Potter series because there is precious little of it in this book.  Most of the characters are miserable human beings, with only a few rays of the good aspects of humanity shining through.  While it is honest to say that most of us have a bad side, the negativity and cynicism in this book are over-the-top.  Don't read it if you want to be uplifted.<br /><br />I think Rowling thought that throwing together every sin known to man with as many curse words as she could jam into a sentence is what constitutes an adult novel.  In truth, Harry Potter is more \\"adult\\" than this work.<br /><br />That being said, I did found some aspects of it interesting enough to entice me to finish.  If you are familiar with Rowling's other work, read it.  See for yourself whether it is on par with her other brilliant pieces.
B00BNWWUDY|4.0|Side Effects (2013) - Jude Law (Sherlock Holmes, Closer), Rooney Mara (Nightmare on Elm St. remake, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo remake ), Channing Tatum (Magic Mike, 21 Jump St.), and Catherine Zeta-Jones (Broken City, Chicago)<br /><br />Steven Soderbergh's latest film \\"Side Effects\\" is an interesting film which takes a post-modern perspective and blends it together with Hitcockian elements. While a film like this has the potential to come off as cheesy since it tackles pharmaceutical companies and their treatment of mental health, I found the writing to be inspired and it made for a very gripping story. Very nice twists and turns. Overall, everyone gives a very good performance with most praise reserved for Mara, Law and Tatum. Each absolutely kills it in their respective roles.<br /><br />Should you buy it? Yes. A very good film, detailed and visually enthralling this is the kind of film you want to own so that you can revisit it every once in a while. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Great acting and a great story about one of the most outstanding American leaders.  This is education and entertaiment in one package.
B005S9ELY4|2.0|Gangster Squad (2013) - Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Emma Stone, Anthony Mackie, Giovanni Ribisi, Michael Pe&ntilde;a, Robert Patrick.<br /><br />Thoughts: Wasn't a fan. Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) already blew my trust with 30 Minutes Or Less, so I was cautiously optimistic about Gangster Squad. Then the Aurora incident occurred and the film was forced to undergo reshoots. That awesome trailer that sells the film as a gritty flick about cops operating outside the law? Total lie. This film tonally cannot handle itself. It simultaneously attempts screwball, slapstick while taking itself too seriously. Based very loosely on a book called Tales from the Gangster Squad, it takes so many liberties that the awesome literally bleeds out leaving a hollow husk of a film. Ryan Gosling talks with an incredibly annoying and soft voice, Brolin tries to play the straight man in this farce and no one apparently told Sean Penn that he was in a comedy because he acts as if he's in a drama (his villainous turn as Mickey Cohen is the high point). Character motivations were embarrassingly sloppy (esp. in regards to Ryan Gosling's character).<br /><br />Should you buy it? I'm a film buff. As such, I hated this film. I would not buy this if it was in a dollar discount bin (which it inevitably will be in a few months). Worth a view? At times it can be funny (even when it's trying to be serious), so as a comedy it could work for a rental. It's an ok bad movie, but not bad enough to be a classic (a la Troll 2 or The Room). If you want mindless fun, go for it. If you want a good gritty film, I highly recommend anything by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, Bronson, Pusher, Valhalla Rising, etc.)
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|While the cruelty he endured was painful to read, I grew to love his character and wanted to comfort him. This was an enjoyable read with sadness, laughter and joy.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|If I could give this product Zero stars, I would. This \\"film\\" proves that 20th Century Fox has no respect for the franchises they have and their faithful audience. In no way is this a real Die Hard movie. The film takes place in Russia. That's really all I can say, because the \\"plot\\" is non existent. John McClane goes to Russia to find his son. That's the description. Turns out his son is CIA (no way!) and that for some reason John and John Jr. don't really get along (hint: because the \\"plot\\" demands it). This is one of four movies I've walked out of and demanded a refund for. I lasted 45 minutes out of his hour and half steamer. If you *must* watch a Die Hard film, go for the original.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Finally, something worth watching. It has been criticized as historically inaccurate but how do they really know? Stop poo-pooing it and sit back and enjoy it. If you want some dry reality, go read tax code or eat saltines. I can't wait for Sunday at 10pm
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I could hardly put this 800+ page book down. Ken Follett always makes his characters come alive.<br />I would highly recommend this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think they should make buckets but with pocket editor you can but there should be sadels and you should get the game.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Fun, fun, fun, fun.  Matthew McConnaughey  YOWSA!  Channing Tatum  More YOWSA!  I thnk I'm getting a hint about why men like their women objectified.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Had to add it to my collection, its just one of those all time great movie, I loved it!  Thanks
1878424319|5.0|This book has a very simple way of saying what are in fact very profound beliefs, if you let them sink in.
B004XZ99LO|3.0|Movie was excellent, color graphics angles of camera shots are impressive, but sound is recorded on 7.1, no 5.1 or 2.1 for just TV sound. So if you don't have 7.1 you will miss some sounds, you will characters mouth moving but no words are heard. Some music is also lacking. You will notice the difference when watching with TV sound only and then thru the surround sound it's almost a different movie.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|In any discussion of which version of Les Mis one prefers, it almost always boils down to Soudtrack versus Stage production.  The Soundtrack versions generally use actors singing the roles, so the singing which workmanlike is not the beautiful soaring tones of the trained musician.  One th e other hand, trained vocalists can find it very very difficult to insert the blood and guts of the emotions of the scenes into their interpretations.  I'm happy to have both versions so I can fill whichever  need I want to.<br />By the way:  SHAME SHAME SHAME on KFC for using the opening of &#34;Look down&#34; unattributed at the end of their commercials.
B00821OX98|5.0|Did not think I would like it but the more you watch it, the more you are drawn to it and want more.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Excitement from start to finish and an interesting twist also.  I like the consistency of characters that continue through the Mitch Rapp series of books.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Love this move and even better in blue ray. I'll be your huckleberry. Great acting and storyline. One of my favorites.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I was familial with the Broadway musical that the movie is taken from but did not expect the intensity of the performances in this version. With very close camera work, live recording of the singing and some masterful performances by the leads and the chorus, most of whom are from one the London productions of the musical this movie rips out your heart, mashes it and hands it back wounded but better than when you started.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Love this movie. It's funny, colorful and fun for the family. Glad to have it in our family movie library
B00797MB0O|1.0|Wish I could have those two hours back. This is a sad, pathetic, movie. It has a lot of negative and mean people in it. Overall the plot was poor and the ending did not rectify it. Good luck.
B000I8G5B2|5.0|It's a great movie, mirrors Aldous Huxley's book.<br />I have watched it several times and I still like it. Definitely recommend it!
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|Anthony Hopkins brings some mischief to the scenes and steals them without making a caricature of his plum role. Helen Mirren brings to life the woman behind Alfred Hitchcock, that let her husband claim the spot light. Excellent supporting cast and script.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|this movie is so funny. loved it and had other friends watch it. i will be buying it for the house
1885167776|5.0|Wish I had read this 40 years ago when I was starting my life and career.  Great insight into what it takes to be successful in all you do.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is the first book by Elizabeth Haynes and I really enjoyed both the story lines and the way it was written, lots of suspense.<br /><br />I am looking for another as good.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I chose to give this show 5 stars because, I can't get enought of watching it. I've heard of it before, but never watched it. I seen that I can watch for free and went for it. Im on season 3 now.
B004C03L4G|4.0|Very insightful book for us Angel believers. The messages are always very pertinent at the time of reading them. I would recommend this.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|She is a big fan of the game and has a lot of fun playing it she's 9 and it's free so I figured what the hey.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Lovely series and shows beautifully. I love this show, its new to me but my brother told me it was a great show.
B0043JEA14|5.0|I have missed the Doobie's.  Listen to any of the songs.  You hear the Doobie sound, the title song  is only the beginning.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love  this game it lets u do any thing and u can play it all the time 8-) LOVE it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version of solitaire is fun, quick and easy to play. Although it can be addicting, I'm keeping it as it is a great time filler. One of my favorites!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Imagine Dragons doens't have a set style of song.. they transition from folky urban tunes to deep bass. I'm bleeding Out is the best song on the album.
B00956UPSW|1.0|Just a Horrible album the guy singing sounds like a f'n girl and the f'n guitars are horrible along with everything else dont buy or download this album or band.
B0064QNS62|5.0|This game is simple and fun to play. It is like the games from the Mario bros. Easy to use for that are not gamers.
B000FBHC7S|5.0|It's so damn Heavy. The damn bass guitar is so f'n crazy along with the lead singer's vocal it is a crazy f'n heavy album.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Call to Atlantis is quite reluctant to download..My internet connection is severely slow,but come on,I downloaded a couple of movies and games while trying to coax Atlantis to come on down. However perseverance occasionally does pay off and I finally got it. Playing the game is quite fun and somewhat challenging ( for a while ) but I just can't see it being worth $3.00, its over too soon and doesn't challenge the old brain cells enough to justify the cost.Still it was entertaining.
B0020VMXRK|1.0|Venom one of the leading forces in the thrash metal genre is one of the most overrated peices of crap I have ever heard of I mean come on Welcome to Hell yeah right more like Welcome to Boring Land. These guys songs are all the same all of them are stupid cetchy tunes that arent event extreme I mean black metal these guys are the first band yeah right whatever.<br /><br />all and all if you like extreme metal stick with Death or Bathory in that matter this band just sucks.
B004A14W3G|5.0|The book was perfectly described and arrived on time. An amazing journey that gives the reader a glimpse of a world most don't even know exists!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really liked this book because it has some true stuff and some not true stuff. I think that this book series is really interesting and everyone should read it more.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I was trying to watch this on CBS but they take down the episodes after like 2 weeks! These episodes streamed well.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book was fantastic and I couldn't put it down.<br />It was a great book that showed love loss heartache and a wonderful look into the brain of a mental patient.
B000FA675C|4.0|I enjoy historical fiction, so I liked this book. I also love English and French history, and the Templars are interesting, so that's kind of what kept me interested in the story.  It had some good twists and turns.
B0058YPILY|5.0|The seventh season of criminal minds was once again a season of highs and lows laughs and tears that kept you on the edge of your seat every single episode.
B000002KE2|4.0|I thought I'd never see this again but it reappeared again, was very happy to see it again, a must for any true &#34;ROCKER&#34;.......
B007JOM7C4|5.0|Hit after hit of catchy tunes! I wish she'd have released peacock and circle the drain along with the other six singles.
B001UE27X8|5.0|There are only a handful of albums as good as this one, no matter which musical category you prefer.  It's rare enough that two artists of this stature work together and the results are no less than sublime.  The sessions were recorded with loving care and the results are sonic perfection.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|The sixth season of criminal minds had so many memorable episodes. I always wonder about the writers who come up with the crimes that they do and if that ever really affects their daily lives?
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Very predictable story line. Also unrealistic. Felt like I had read the book before. But it was a very light, entertaining read.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|\\"Brave\\" is an exhilarating movie by Disney Pixar about a Scottish princess who wants to be able to choose her own suitor. Princess Merida is strong, stubborn and brave but gets herself (and her mother) in trouble when she follows will-o-wisps in the forest and does business with a witch.<br /><br />The graphics are exceptional. The musical soundtrack was perfect for the movie. I thought casting for the voices of the many characters was particularly spot on.<br /><br />This is an uplifting movie and I look forward to the day I can watch it with my twin grandchildren. But not only children will enjoy this movie. I'm sure past that point in my life and I thought it was fun and inspiring.<br /><br />There are some scary parts to the movie so this isn't for little children - I would say probably at least eight years old. Others have mentioned nudity. What you see is cartoon backsides. I was not offended by the scenes.
B005HSL626|5.0|The satisfaction I feel while slicing and attacking fruits really is amazing to me. I can never get enough of this game.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I do not find this very challenging, the tables are small and repetitive. After a couple runs thru I was done with it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I spend hours on pinterest and am glad that now I have my Pinterest Kindle app with me with me wherever I go.
B0064MGU98|3.0|i found the main character unbelievable and unlikable; her hair keeps falling in her face! all her best ideas come from other people! she has a bland personality! hard to believe she has enough brains or character to be the person she's supposed to be! otherwise: good enough script to keep interest, but i won't be watching any more episodes.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I LOVE this game. It keeps me occupied for hours! - well, once I have enough lives. Very simple concept, but you'd be surprised how addictive it can be.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|She just... Doesn't act.  She's the perfect typecast of a apathetic robot.<br /><br />She should play a female version of Data from Star Trek.  She's a natural fit for it.<br /><br />&#34;You've been kidnapped by an evil witch who will do horrible things to you.&#34;<br />&#34;ok&#34;<br />&#34;You will be held prisoner!&#34;<br />&#34;ok&#34;<br />&#34;You will ultimately be killed!&#34;<br />(yawn) &#34;ok&#34;<br /><br />(these are not lines from the movie)<br /><br />Other than that, it actually wasn't bad!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|JJ Abrams does it again. Taking the characters and making them so lovable and making them the part of the show you want to follow is great!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It's Men in Black!  They do a great job with it, so it doesn't have to be one of those once in a lifetime awesome legendary films.  It's fun.  The story in this one is worth watching too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing one of the best things that has happened to this world. I think it was great
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|We watched the very short British Sherlock and were looking for something else. One if my student recommended this. We like it a lot.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Way too much CG not as good as the first three.The production values are great but i did not care for the actors as i did in the others.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I liked the decisions that Jonas makes and how hard he tried to save Gabriel and the ending was really cool. It made you think about what actually happened. I wish there was a sequel so I could know what happened.
B0094MFITS|5.0|Everyone wishes they knew someone like Jesse Stone. He cares about people. I have read all the books the tv movies are based on. Tom Selleck does an outstanding job of portraying the small town sheriff. He is Jesse. I love all the characters, they are important to the story. I think Mr. Parker would be proud of the way his books have turned out. I hope the series continues and Jesse gets his job back.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|One of the best books I have read. I love everything about it. I was so engrossed with the poetry - that alone was enough to have me hooked - but the characters, love story, and family issues - the entire book was wonderful - I could not wait to read Point of Retreat.<br /><br />Great read - Colleen Hoover is an awesome writer.
B00B19DW0E|5.0|Snake is one of the most badass characters ever in a film. This movie can be watched over and over (and I do). If you want to watch a great character struggle against insurmountable odds and a deadly deadline, this is the movie for you. There really hasn't been another film like this -- and Escape from LA was only a pale imitation.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|it's Firefly! the only thing wrong with it was the 1 season and the movie it got. it's a shame when GREAT tv get's cancelled for lesser ones like any &#34;reality&#34; based show.
B009CG1YZ8|5.0|I am not a fan of zombie movies, but Army of Darkness is one of my favorite weird films. Bruce Campbell is perfect as Ash, &#34;trapped in a world he never made.&#34; (And running out of gas, too!) This is one of the funnier movies in this genre, and when I say it's right up there with anything Monty Python did, I'm giving it high praise. Other reviewers have gone over the plot. All I can say is that it's a true pleasure to watch this film, and I watch it again from time to time, still enjoying it as much as the first time.
0307346609|5.0|Anything zombie, I'm pretty much on top of! Cant wait til the movie comes out. The book is pretty good.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|The actors were engaging and funny. The story was really good and realistic of turning 40. However, the movie dragged on too long and I lost interest towards the end.
B004WR125O|5.0|I purchased this to go with my Onkyo reciever and I really enjoy it.  It was a little difficult to set up but after watching an instructional video on Youtube, I was able to get setup.
030758836X|2.0|I thought the language was profane, overused and unnecessary. Could have been a good read and plot without it.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I like the game and it's fun to play, but I need to have internet access to play it. I wasn't aware of that when I downloaded it. It's still a good game and I enjoy it when I am connected.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Tyler the creator brings a solid album and Wolf tops Goblin by miles in my opinion and is worth copping.
B0009X7664|5.0|I had long wanted to buy my sister a gift that I knew she would cherish. This was it! After she received it I got a call telling me how much she appreciated it and that she had already watched it. Thanks to AMAZON.Com I found the perfect gift! Amazon has ALWAYS had quality service that I can depend on. I will continue to buy from them for myself, family and friends!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Been playing this on my kindle fire almost non stop for last two days. Guess I should eat something lol
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I love this show. I already know I will be sad when it is over, so will a lot of people.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Review<br />I really just did this to get the gems but i want to know who got the unicorn and you can add me search aceswagge will have fun
B0068MNO4S|4.0|I wanted to know if the Earl of Oxford or William Shakespeare from Stratford upon Avon wrote the plays.<br />However the movie did not really analyze or study the subject in depth.
B0042KZJ46|5.0|This was a birthday gift -- requested by someone who was there. Can't put a price on that. He loves it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Continue one's journey with the Crawley family ~ the season brought more twists and turns. Despite having two incredibly long episodes (merged as best one can tell), the series continues to delight.
B0038QN2AS|5.0|This is a great book that covers what Internet could become if things go wrong. this is very interesting looking forward if anyone wants to read it
B003THHIEM|5.0|Humorous and suspenseful show with great characters that have a funny relationship. I like that it isn't too serious for being a crime show
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Way better than I expected. Probably the best book I've read in 5 years. I'll be buying the Shift omnibus next.
B0060CWUB4|5.0|The family enjoys this movie and we range from ages 12 to 50.  Had watched many times when kids were younger and finally decided too add it to our Disney movie collection
B00004Y6NU|5.0|To avoid repetition, I think Themis-Athena's review hit a lot of nails on the head, especially the last paragraph. This album seems to be an \\"extra effort\\" by all involved, from the musicians to the sound engineers, and whatever \\"super bit mapping\\" by Warner might be on this re-release 18 years after the original it seems to work. The sound quality is superb, not something one can say about some of the live-performance CD's by the band - for obvious reasons. A must-have CD for the best coverage of the five songs included here. MK rules.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Heartbreaking, yet inspiring.  I read this book in its entirety in one sitting.  Great for self reflection.  Bring some tissues.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|My family liked it.  We saw it first in the theater and then at home.  It was good family fun.  Loved Jane Lynch's character.
B006PRCGKO|5.0|Don't believe rotten tomatoes or metacritic on this one. This is a very underrated sci-fi thriller. Better than Prometheus or the standard big budgets of today.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|It was funny.  Nice to see that even vampires have to live with teenagers.  Not always fun!  Secretly this movie shows that all families have issues.  Even the real close ones.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|enjoyed the movie.. superb acting.. little slow and but if you like historical content do watch this movie ...cannot watch with kids as they are few scenes that they are not okay for kids
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|I thought the game was kind of fun for a while, then I lost interest. Fluid game play, but not really enough to keep my attention for very long.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|love sudoku I play this game every day all the time.  great why to exersize my mind it works great
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I've heard about this game and I've tried to like it. Each time I've played it I question myself as to why. It turns out that rolling around the dark woods, looking for cryptic signs and avoiding the creepy shadow figure just isn't all that fun. I just don't get it.
B004OZZ624|3.0|The police suspicion & chase while he was performing the escape was not realistic at all, which brings the movie down a bit.
B006HL9G10|1.0|Either I just didn't get it or I thought that sitting around listening to clanging bowls was far from relaxing. I certainly failed to &#34;find my center&#34; as I couldn't help but feel kind of dumb that I actually downloaded this.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|Answers many questions that I've asked myself over the years.  As I was reading, I came across so many examples that I couldn't wait to share with friends and colleagues.  Fascinating, engaging and extremely well written, it will provide crucial insights for those who teach, sell, or just want to have a better way to persuade someone to see another side of the issue.
B00846F1YW|1.0|I've played a few of these types of games. I spend 10's of minutes looking for little doodads that are pretty easy to find. Then get bored to death trying to skip the dull story line that borders each &#34;Where's Waldo&#34; event. Not for me.
1440503257|5.0|I bought this cookbook for my daughter for Easter this year because she is a big Harry Potter fan.<br />She loves it and even though she has not been able to make anything out of this book yet, I would still<br />recommend this for anyone who loves anything about this story.<br /><br />The only bad thing about this book is that it is not written by anyone officially noted with HarryPotter
1455519650|5.0|I have read, and will continue to read all of Michael Connelly's writings.  I'm a bookworm and have a number of favorite authors, but he is high on the list.  I love Harry Bosch's character, and the way Connelly has developed him over the years.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|This is another one of those books that I never finished in my youth. I don't think I would've ever fully appreciated it back then, because the language IS rather... foreign.<br /><br />Having read it now, as an adult, it's not a bad story. The ending is definitely not what I had been led to believe from everything I'd heard about it. Jim Hawkins, the doctor, Benn Gunn and Long John Silver are all memorable characters. They're well fleshed out and consistently portrayed.<br /><br />The story itself has it's moments. I will confess to reading four or five pages, and at times stopping to wonder what had just happened. Some chapters I didn't have a clue what was going on, and because of it I missed important pieces of information which only served to confuse me further down the road. Other times, though, I was riveted, and that's what finally decided the three-star rating!<br /><br />I've never REALLY been a fan of pirate stories, but I think that this is definitely one of those classics that everyone should read at least once in their lives. If you enjoy pirates, though, you'll probably rate this one much higher than I did!
0345803507|2.0|A male friend of mine had bought and read all three books and told me he cried at the end,<br />that intrigued me since he is not the real sensitive type and offered me the books.<br />I had heard all the hype and hoopla before, and really had no intention of buying and reading it.<br />I decided to download them from Amazon instead of walking around with the books. What a waste of my eyesight!!<br /><br />I couldn't believe that I read all three books although I did skip all the repetitive sex after a while.<br />I have read some of the reviews of course and everyone said about the same thing in different ways.<br />Now is it just me, or did anyone else mention how sick this girl was. She immediately finds out he likes to<br />beat and torture brown haired girls and she thinks somehow she is going to fix him, Ha! Knowing he is sadistic<br />and damaged she eggs him on in everyway she can think of. She continually wants him to hurt her and tries to get<br />him to take her to the red room of pain. SHE IS AS SICK AS HE IS! It took me a very long time to get through these<br />books, it was only during the times of the suspense with her ex boss that I was really interested, the rest was<br />adolescent unrealistic, and boring to say the least...I still haven't had a chance to talk to my friend to ask him<br />WHAT THE HELL MADE HIM CRY!! After reading this garbage I'm going to give him something to cry about! LOL
B00138JCMA|5.0|The much anticipated second Wu album, released after the couple solo projects took off (which should also be checked out) in between this and the first album 36 chambers. For the second album, the Wu gives us a double LP, and every song is either great or greater. They go more places here, expanding their sound while keeping it a cohesive sounding album. You know the Wu is the best when one of the hit singles (Triumph) doesn't even have a chorus/hook, but instead just gives you each member rapping, and it's freaking beautiful.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I love this movie. I love the BBC version way better than that horrendous Gwyenth Paltrow version. It's pretty long but great!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Early in the movie I was found myself really enjoying it, and started thinking this might be a great movie. Then Peter Jackson reminded me that he directed it. With his disgustingly cheesy moments sprinkled in, and overly silly video game action scenes... but still, some shining moments.<br /><br />The lead who played Bilbo, British-Office-Guy I think is his name, was great. Loved him the whole way. Played the character of Bilbo perfectly, which was created by Tolkien as a exaggerated British gentleman in the first place (I think). The scenes between Bilbo and Gollum were the best part of the movie.<br /><br />Still worth a watch. Has some great visuals, Gandalf's in it, some of the dwarves are cool, and British-Office-Guy kills it (Martin Freeman so I don't feel guilty for never saying his name).
B0084670FU|1.0|I really didn't like this movie--- it was so splintered--- hard to fallow ans keep up with--- although I thought the acting was good
B00136JS8U|5.0|Nothing against most of the later stuff after Wu Tang Forever, but the first few solo albums and first 2 Wu albums are just creepy good ya know? The rapping hasn't gotten worse with time, it's just the production has gotten too polished and over produced with later albums. These early albums, like Rae's 4 Cuban Linx, are classic Wu gritty and cohesive as a whole, sounding like the producer (RZA) and artists really knew where they wanted to go with it.<br /><br />Rae is great. Ghostface is the greatest . And overall a perfect album.
B0071NLG0W|4.0|A good continuation of the Amber Fox series. Definitely the UK version of Stephanie Plum. It's like a Tastykake feast for your brain!
B000VWPX3G|5.0|This album is produced when the RZA was (I think) at his strongest, and most driven era of his production. The sound of the album is so other-worldly, mysterious, and ethereal, which mesh so well with GZA's writing. GZA cuts through the album educating the listener, talking about where he's come from and what he's learned about life and creation along the way.<br /><br />GZA is my favorite of the Wu members (which is saying a lot), because of the wisdom, humble attitude, and rhymes that really, I mean really, impress you when you listen. A must have if you like good hip-hop and don't mind smart raps. Wu Tang forever.
B002RPPNVW|5.0|One of the all time great Science Fiction movies ever! This movie came out way before Star Wars and still holds it own in the genre. One of my all time favs!
B00136JR2M|5.0|The passion and drive behind Wu Tang early on comes though load and clear on their first album. Created independently after some of the clan's members (mainly the RZA and GZA) had already experienced the BS of dealing with commercial labels, Wu Tang Clan formed from the best local rappers from Staten Island (a group of 9) to get together and create a work that was so good it could sell itself once heard without going though the BS of the labels. Which worked, because it is that good. So good it's creepy. This is what a group of super talented people can do when they have each other to push and drive one another to new heights of excellence. R.I.P. O.D.B.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album grew on me.  First time through I connected with maybe one or two songs. But by the fourth time I finally arrived at a fuller appreciation of the others.  There is so much here it takes time to comprehend it, but pace yourself because you don't want to burn out. These are extremely experienced rock musicians.  I'd also recommend Vapor Trails, Test for Echo and Counter Parts.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|For me, this was the best of the three books.  I hated to see it end.<br />I was hoping there would be a fourth book soon.  I am not an avid reader<br />but could not put these three books down.  Read them very quickly, and<br />sorry it ended so soon.  LOL
B008MIMWOO|4.0|Caught this on sale for like 12 bucks, which is the reason i bought it. Movie quality is as good as any other blu-ray.<br />Not reviewing the movies themselves, since i was already a fan of the movies and just bought them at around 4 bucks per movie. Price was too good to pass up.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I had two Vivitar flashes prior to purchasing this one and I've gotta say it does a spectacular job.  I love the power output and the fact that it has a lower profile than my previous units.  Very fast recycle time and great for those moments when you need a quick, even fill.  Beautiful device.  Be very careful when opening the battery door as it appears to be VERY fragile.  There's a button that you have to depress to release the door...if you don't do so, you may damage it.  Other than that...I love it!!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I didn't see one part coming and that always makes for a good book. I need six more words so
1609611543|3.0|Not exactly what I expected. Not enough information on how to lose the belly. Mostly on how growing wheat has changed
B005DWBO0K|3.0|Well, it was a silent movie but entertaining to someone who likes wierd movies.  It was better than TV. It was funny.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|This is a classic!!! I love this movie and now with the commentary... EVEN BETTER. Having those involved with creating the movie tear it apart and making hilarious joke throughout the commentary was unexpected and hilarious. I can easily sit through the movie twice in a row and be entertained. Once, just the movie and the second with the commentary. Also, the audio and video have been cleaned up remarkably for this release.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|I would recommend to anyone that they watch this great movie.  I was forced to watch it for class, but it ended up being pretty good.
B005LAJ23A|4.0|Though this season was much slower than last it did a lot of story telling and further character development. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched through multiple times now.
B003CN4R74|4.0|Amy Lee has such a wonderful voice. After listening to this album, not much stands out about it. It is ok as background music, but doesn't do it for me like previous albums.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It allows my wife and I the flexibility to move around while using the longer cable on our IPad enough said
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|also really good movie the boys so enjoyed the action and i love robert downey<br />it was really a great dvd
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is addictive.  I can't get enough.  Dame Maggie Smith is at her finest.  Superb cast and acting.  Wonderful story.  Beautifully filmed.  Highly recommend.  Try it...you will love it!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|so loved the lorex as some one who was taught to read on dr seuss . it is so nice to see hes work carried on
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The Scott team really keep you in suspense mode, just when you think you have them figured out you realize that you are sadly mistaken.
B000WN60NG|5.0|A far fetched labor of love for someone that loves the blues, leads us on a journey to the crossroads. It is here that all the leading up comes to life and the guitar battle completely engulfs you. I just love this movie and the devil goes down to Texas storyline. No one in this movie ever was rewarded for their contributions but the blues are pure and the story is well told. Feel free to enjoy
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My 8 year old son read this book after reading the whole Percy Jackson series and loved it.  The whole series is great!
043902353X|5.0|I think Book 2 in the Hunger Games trilogy is as good as the first book.  I love the characters and couldn't put it down.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Ostensibly about the hunt for UBL, this movie is actually a clear illustration of how government bureaucracy works, its malevolent aspects, and its ultimate triumph over individuals rash enough to take it on. The final scene as Maya, all alone, boards a huge empty transport to go (where?) clearly shows that her career is toast at the CIA because she continually bucked the brass to get things done, even when she was warned to lay off. That's a cardinal sin. She will pay, and she knows it. The only reason she was able to continue her hunt was that some people in the Obama White House took an interest in her work and kept it alive. Without that angle, Langley was ready to crush her early on.<br /><br />Had the CIA actually been happy with her exploits, the final scene would have had her on board the CIA director's private jet, being hailed by her supportive colleagues amid popping champagne corks, flying to Langley for a celebration honoring her achievement. But no. In the end, bureaucracy always triumphs.<br /><br />Let it be be a lesson to would-be government employees: no matter what the agency--any agency--says its goals are, the real goals of everyone in the place is to avoid risk, avoid making waves, and getting promotions, all the while calculating the growth in one's 401Ks and maximizing vacation and retirement bennies. If your role allows you to harass private citizens with whatever agency rules can be brought to bear, so much the better.

B000J5XS3C|1.0|WTF.  There's no PFL, so you can't listen to a channel before putting it through the mains.  The control room/headphones knob only controls how much of the main mix goes to the headphones/control room.  Meaning, you HAVE to send signal to the mains in order to hear anything through the headphones, and to hear your mix without sending it to the amps, you have to unplug the amps, which of course pops hard.  Major fail.<br /><br />And the 2-track input is virtually useless for functionality.  I'd have preferred they dump the 2-track function and add a PFL.  The unbalanced inputs are not stereo inputs, as one would assume.  So you can't plug a stereo 1/4th inch cord into the left side and get stereo.  Not sure why they labeled the left input as unbalanced, actually.  You have to use a splitter that takes a female stereo and turns it into dual male mono cords.  Buy a bunch of these: [[ASIN:B000068O5D HOSA Stereo 1/4-Inch Phone Female - Two Mono 1-Tip and 1-Ring 1/4-Inch Phone Male - 6-Inch]].  Of lesser fail, when you hit the phantom power, it takes an hour for the light to turn off, I guess the juice has to drain off.  Meh.  Not a big deal, but it took me a while to figure out it wasn't broken.<br /><br />Now.  I will say the rest of the functions work great, as well as I would expect.  The gains are great and it functions almost like a cheap (I say cheap because it's a bit noisy, as others have said) pre-amp in gain function and the meter lights are nicely reactive/accurate.  Not redeeming enough to give it any more than 1 star though.  I'm pissed that the lack of PFL is not in the description; when I see separate main/headphone volume controls I don't ever think that one is dependent on the other.  That's stupid.  I will buy a bunch of splitters and make this work because it's still smaller than others and made out of metal, but I'm not happy with this thing.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Nice job History Channel. Vikings is an enjoyable blood, guts and swords action series that is still true to real history.
0345345061|3.0|I originally intended to purchase this (The TR) as a gag gift for my step pepper, seeing as he is completely obsessed with Bilbo Baggins, Pleasant Ridge Chili, and and all things catlike, but after reading the first few passages...I was all like &#34;whoa&#34; and &#34;dude&#34;. I've since taken it back from my stepep, much to his chagrin. The look on his face was priceless. He was mainly embarrassed, but who cares. I think he was more embarrassed that he left the tag on the squishy beanie slouchy hat I had also purchased for him (it was to be a gag gift as well) seeing as he has 9 pounds of human hair and clearly would not need the squishy beanie babe hat. I knew I had to keep this book. It raises some interesting questions...like &#34;what is this&#34;? and &#34;who is he talking to&#34;? We all know that the Byrds were folk rock at it's finest. They did it better than anyone, but you have to ask yourself (and you will ask yourself) &#34;What if I was reincarnated as Sharon Stone's couch cushions&#34;? or worse if I died and came back as Raymond Burr's bicycle seat. Anyway, this is not the point. And yet...yet I digress.. J.R.R. has done it again! Kudos to all who purchase this little ensemble of literary drivel. I especially enjoyed the bit about the great vegetable rebellion and how J.R.R. used to sit in front of the mirror eating fig newtons and drinking Nestle's &#34;strawberry&#34; milk...with the crumbs in his disgusting beard...repeating over and over...&#34;have another fig newton, fatty...have another&#34;. Highly recommended for step peppers everywhere.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Another winner from Andrew Lloyd Webber. Absolutely brilliant music, scenery and songs. This follows the story after Phantom of the Opera. The ending has a definite twist to it - totally unexpected! After watching and listening to Phantom for so many years, this DVD did take a time or two to watch before I was hooked due to different actors playing the part. Special effects are a winner too.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|Interesting program.  Like going over the series that I watched many years ago and missed some episodes and can now catch up.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|A classic. Seeing it come alive in such a historical venue is a work of art. The music is thrilling, the songs are classic. Costumes and scenery brilliant. If you love Andrew Lloyd Webber's music then you will enjoy this. All done live on stage. A work of art.

B00BHU9DUK|4.0|This version takes place in a playhouse...a play within a movie.  But...no audience..that part is you...and the characters walk all over the stage, back stage, side stage, orchestra pit, and into where the audience seats have been removed.  Then it switches, magically, to real time scenery.  Unusual....and a bit disconcerting at first.  This had the same effect on me that Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge.  That movie blew me away with how differently it was filmed.  This had Kiera.  How could it be bad?  She is the quintessential tragic heroine.  Her clothes are to DIE for.  And the jewelry and hats.  Aaron seems too young for her... appropriately handsome and caddish....not being able to curb his wandering single eye even though a gorgeous woman has just given everything up for him.  He was better in Savages.  Jude does not seem as stern as he is portrayed in the book.  They have softened him somewhat.  Story does give you the whole AK experience but they have taken liberties with story line.  See this for an experience in beauty.  The whole throwing-yourself-in-front-of-a-train idea is not fleshed out...for those who have not read the book or seen the many movies made of this story.  Still, worth seeing.

B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I was disappointed in this movie, after all the hype.  I found it long and somewhat boring.  The characters rarely spoke in their speaking voices, only sang.  After two and a half hours of singing, it became a bit much for me.  Other people may better appreciate this movie.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|As a reader of Civil War and WWII history I must rank this among the finest.  This work has a profound message of the good in all men, friend or enemy.<br />  It is basically the story of German pilot, Franz Stigler,  his war years and life.<br />  As usual I will leave the in depth reviews to others and simply tell you that you will experience a story that you are not likely to forget.<br />  This is a book of rare quality.  6 Stars!!
B005V2S7FW|5.0|works as advertised cross-platform pc-ios-kindle hd...  the auto log-in feature can sometimes get you into a loop on sites that return you to the initial login screen at logout - you log out only to wind up auto-logged in again-use judiciously.  Would be better if browser behavior settings were applied across individual browsers, rather than make you set each install (IE, Chrome, Dolphin, etc) separately and on each machine...
B000WGWQG8|5.0|i love this mini series so much.  this goes in depth not what you would expect from from Hollywood.  Paul played the role vary well as if he was Adams.  does not just cover his presidency term but going to France with Ben Franklin to get them to be our allies and the signing of the declaration and more.
B00992CF6W|1.0|no support.  assumes you know and like minecraft on another platform.  Its really not a game so much as a puzzle to figure out what its supposed to be.  If there'd been a free trial version, I would've skipped it, but hype made me waste a purchase to find out.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It arrived on time and without scratchs. I tried the spanish subtitules, they look fine and the translation is good also<br />I love the DVD-Bluray combo. Why can't more movies be like this? Even the ultraviolet code worked!

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This was a very good,classic book. But  left me with a few questions. One,for example,was what became of the tin man's lover?He said as soon as he gets a heart,he would go to her,and marry her,but in the end he seemed to forget all about her,and rule the Winkies. It was strange to me,though a small problem,and I found it  is great for all ages because,although it is simpler to understand(it is meant to be a children's book after all)it has a great plot line adults  can enjoy as well. I hope this review was helpful!Happy reading!!Please note that I am only eleven so I apologize for any grammatical incorrectness
B008602KQI|5.0|The key to the success of this movie is Jennifer Lawrence. She is real, conflicted and so believable. I don't normally enjoy this type of film but after seeing it the first time in the theater and went out and became engrossed in all three books. Can't wait for Catch a Fire!

0307352153|4.0|I first heard about Susan Cain from her TED video. I loved the video so much that I decided to read her book.<br /><br />I am an introvert. I guess I should start out by stating that. I re-charge by myself, I think better by myself and I just thrive by myself. One of the the main things I liked about this book as how she laid out what an extrovert was and what an introvert was. The history behind the extrovert leader and how being an introvert does not leave you with a scarlet letter.<br /><br />While I found some parts of the book dry I really got a lot out of this book and would recommend it to anyone who is an introvert or who has an introverted child or works with an introvert. After all:<br /><br />\\"Without introverts, the world would be devoid of<br /><br />the theory of gravity<br />the theory of relativity<br />W.B. Yeats's `The Second Coming'<br />Chopin's nocturnes<br />Proust's `In Search of Lost Time'<br />Peter Pan<br />Orwell's '1984′ and `Animal Farm'<br />The Cat in the Hat<br />Charlie Brown<br />`Schindler's List,' `E.T.,' and `Close Encounters of the Third Kind'<br />Google<br />Harry Potter\\"
B005KELQEU|3.0|The case is good for protecting the kindle while I carry it, or put it in a bag or backpack. The soft inside keeps the kindle from getting scratched and the zippers are made so that they will not touch the kindle, another way to keep your kindle from being scratched. I don't like the cases that stay attached to the kindle. I like holding the bare kindle while I read, so this is just what I wanted.<br /><br />Unfortunately the quality is not what it used to be. I had purchased the exact same case for my Kindle 2 a few years ago and it looked great. The quality on this case does not match my old case. The &#34;leather&#34; sides on this case are wrinkled and not flat. The stitching on the the side and corners is not straight. It looks more homemade than professional like it used to.<br /><br />Overall it is a good case, and I have no doubt that it will protect my Kindle, I'm just disappointed in the drop in quality since my last purchase.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Hanging on every word until the end. Can't wait to see what happens next. This author knows how to capture her audiences attention. I hope the movie does this book justice.

B00C7L4QB4|4.0|I've read a couple of true-crime books from Stephen Williams, probably the guy on the planet who knows the most about Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo, AKA Leanne Bordelais and Paul Teale.  \\"Invisible Darkness\\" was a gripping read, while \\"Karla:  Deal with the Devil\\" wasn't quite as good, as the second book was a little too scattershot to enjoy, if one may \\"enjoy\\" reading a book about serial killers.<br /><br />But in those books, Mr. Williams indicts not only Ms. Bordelais and Mr. Teale, but he indicts the Canadian judicial system and the police as well.  The police liked to change their stories during the trials of the married couple -- they were tried separately near Toronto -- and the police used whatever narrative that they believed would be the most helpful at the time.  \\"Ms. Homolka is an evil monster,\\" during her own trial, followed by, \\"Ms. Homolka is was an abused wife of a sociopathic monster,\\" at Mr. Bernardo's trial.  And the police and judicial system convinced psychiatrists to give both sides of the story as well.<br /><br />How did they do this?  Well, the police had their own agendas, and so did the judicial system.  But so did the psychiatrists.  And this is what I actually thought of immediately when Laurence Fishburne is discussing strategy in a recent episode of \\"Hannibal\\" with two psychiatrists that work for Mr. Fishburne:  Mads Mikkelsen -- AKA Dr. Hannibal Lecter -- and Caroline Dhavernas -- Dr. Alana Bloom.  Well, Mr. Lecter gives the answer that fits Mr. Fishburne's \\"agenda\\" -- Mr. Fishburne's words and not mine -- the best.  Guess who Mr. Fishburne ultimately listened to for advice?<br /><br />And this, in a nutshell, is one reason why I really like this series.  It is very realistic in the sense that the characters have their own agendas, and they may be more than willing to discuss those agendas and push them in this fine television show.  But there is something else that they do that's really smart here.  Even though the audience knows that Dr. Lecter is a really bad guy -- or at least will become one as this is a prequel to the movies -- he's oddly more of a sympathetic character when juxtaposed against Ms. Dhavernas.  She seems to have an agenda as well, and that agenda seems to be purely political.  And everybody hates a weasel like her.  So it's pretty danged nifty how they make the audience like a serial killer such as Mr. Lecter more than someone like Ms. Dhavernas.  Nice trick.<br /><br />And the lead -- Hugh Dancy -- is also really good.  He's always on edge, but he's supposed to be.  You don't know if he'll go all crazy either, and you kind of get a feeling that he just might kill somebody at any old time.  He even says as much in this recent episode, words that he may later learn to regret.  Stay tuned.<br /><br />Well, everybody loves serial killers nowadays, from what it seems, at least if you look at the latest television listings.  We have \\"The Bates Motel,\\" another series that I really like.  We have \\"Hannibal,\\" which is at least as good, perhaps better.  And then we have \\"The Following,\\" in my opinion a series that will most likely be cannibalized by both.

B008YF4BIU|5.0|Betty J. Eadie had a Near-Death Experience in 1973 that was [in her recounting] one of the most detailed ever recorded. She also wrote the follow-up book, [[ASIN:1451686560 The Awakening Heart: My Continuing Journey to Love]], as well as [[ASIN:B005XD5KJK The Ripple Effect Our Harvest]]. Her LSD/Mormon background---which is reflected is her comments about the preexistence, etc.---is not detailed in this book, but is known from other sources; e.g., [[ASIN:0889651191 Embraced by the Light and the Bible Betty Eadie and Near-Death Experiences  in the Light of Scripture]].<br /><br />She says of her experience, \\"I saw a pinpoint of light in the distance... It was the most unconditional love I have ever felt... There was no questioning who he was... He was Jesus Christ... I wanted to know why there were so many churches in the world. Why didn't God give us only one church, one pure religion? ... Each of us, I was told, is at a different level of spiritual development and understanding. Each person is therefore prepared for a different level of spiritual knowledge. All religions upon the earth are necessary because there are people who need what they teach... No one church can fulfill everybody's needs at every level.\\" (\\"Embraced by the Light\\" chapter)<br /><br />She says, \\"There are far fewer accidents here than we imagine, especially in things that affect us eternally. The hand of God, and the path we chose before we came here, guide many of our decisions and even many of the seemingly random experiences we have.\\" (\\"Healing---and Dying\\" chapter) She notes, \\"Of all knowledge, there is none more essential than knowing Jesus Christ... Whether we learn of Jesus Christ here or while in the spirit, we must eventually accept him and surrender to his love.\\" (\\"The Greeting Party\\" chapter)<br /><br />She observed of angels, \\"They delighted to help us and were especially joyful when somebody prayed with enough intensity and faith to be answered immediately. They always responded to the brighter, larger prayers first, then each prayer in turn, until all of them were answered. I did notice, however, that insincere prayers of repetition have little if any light; and having no power, many of them are not heard.\\" (\\"Prayer\\" chapter)<br /><br />She states, \\"Five years after my death experience I felt a desire to go back to the hospital to find out what might have happened to me physically that night... I didn't need the doctors' confirmation to know that I had died---Jesus himself told me I had---but my friends wanted more information.\\" (\\"My Recovery\\" chapter)<br /><br />She reveals in the concluding chapter, \\"More experiences have come to me since November 18, 1973, but I am reluctant to share them here; it took nineteen years and countless proddings to get me to share the experiences in this book. Everything has its time; for this book, the time is now.\\"<br /><br />For anyone interested in Near-Death experiences, this book will be of great interest.the brighter, larger prayers first, then each prayer in turn, until all of them were answered.

B00AW57L96|5.0|Really struggled to put this book down. Was a great storyline and characters were portrayed in an excellent way, would recommend  for anyone who wants a book with romance, a little action, lots of emotion and some good twists.
B008M7JODC|5.0|If you enjoy intelligent, imaginative, thought provoking Science Fiction, you must watch this series.<br /><br />It has been a very long time since a TV show has caught my interest the way Fringe has.<br />The show is a great mix of solid fact based sci-fi, and crime drama, with a deep conspiracy theme running behind it all.<br />Fringe is so well put together that I find myself likening it to a good book, in that, I can't put it down.<br />Each episode is excellent on it's own, but I find myself loading the next one in anticipation of finding out more about what the truth behind the big picture is.<br />Fortunately for me, Amazon has all the seasons available for streaming (no waiting). ;)
B001VIMCW4|5.0|I would recommend this movie because it has great action scenes and daniel craig makes it really easy to watch.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It is difficult sometimes for a musical to have the same impact as a drama.  I am not sentimental at all, but I was in tears by the end of the movie.  The voices were spectacular and it was a delight to hear stars sing in their real voices when you have never heard them sing before and didn't know they could.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|By far this album exceeded all expectations that was given by critics. Each song has bits and pieces pulled from past Bowie albums (How does the Grass Grow? sounds like it could have come off the Lodger album) . The album was very well produced and well written. This is one of Bowie's BEST albums( and I have them ALL), I would consider it in my top five favorite albums he has ever made!!!!!!!!!
B001F0WXY0|1.0|This a review of the KINDLE version!!<br />Today I decided to start reading this book on the train to work. I read mostly on the train or the bus to and from work. I took out my Kindle touch and started to read. I read a couple of pages but it was so noisy on the train so I decided to listen to the audio book instead. It started and when the narrator came to the 2nd paragraph I realized that I hadn't read the text he was reading just a couple of minutes before. I took out my kindle again to check and I was right. Now at work I went to this page and looked at the preview of the book vs the kindle version and I saw that the 2nd paragraph of the book was missing from the Kindle version. I am very surprised to see this. I also have the paperback at home (I am in the process of going fully digital on my great Kindle reader). For me, who is a perfectionist when it comes to books and most other stuff (I want to read exactly what the writer and editors have written and published), this is completely unacceptable (what other stuff is missing from the Kindle version I asked myself). I guess I have to take out my paperback to be able to read this book with the full text.<br />So to conclude, AVOID this Kindle version if you want to read what Frank Herbert wrote.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Shantaram  is the best book I have ever read! It has been a life changing book for me.  I am almost finished with it. From the very beginning it captivated me, changing my out look on life. I have laughed, cried, felt heartbroken, and felt as if I was living the story with him.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I don't know why I like this stupid show, but I do.  But how long can the flesh stay attached to a dead body?  I am waiting on the season where there is nothing but skeletons walking around. :)
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Tom cat never repeated anything I said! I tried over and over and still no repeated words were said, disappointment.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|Very interesting information about how humans, when under pressure, &#34;thin slice&#34; through immediately available information to make judgments about their surroundings sometimes for the good, sometimes for the not so good. I recommend this read for anyone who finds human behavior fascinating and a little confusing!
B0042GIRYE|5.0|IT WAS JUST WHAT I WANTED.  COULD NOT FIND IT LOCALLY, BUT IT WAS GREAT TO SEE IT ON AMAZON. THANK YOU
B004LZFWJO|5.0|A bit addictive and very challenging.  I like the graphics.  The kisses look real.  You can spend a lot of time playing this game.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Some numbers are hard to fine, but we have had a great time with this game.  Folks, games are important to help keep our minds active.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I love this product because it protects the kindle as well as you can put it in several different positions.
B00AR3WD8W|3.0|This has been going on now for years for Elvis re-issue cd's  . If you have the re-masters from the 97 and 98 cd's don't bother unless you want the bonus tracks . The sound on this is terrible . the 1998 cd sounds much better .
B009PK9SB8|5.0|No longer, must one wonder how the footage they've recorded, came out. Now you don't  have to wait until you upload the video, to a laptop, to see what you've filmed. The attachable LCD touch screen, allows you so much more versatility, that never again will you go home without the shot.
B008PZ69Q6|3.0|Get it for the extra cd but it is the same as the Elvis an afternoon at the garden . THis has become really lame that they can't give the KING a full upgraded remaster from a 1997 disc . Don't even bother with the Aloha 2013 cd unless again you want the extras , That one sounds worse then the 1998 aloha cd , man what a disappointment !!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it. It's so handy and larger than my pocket calculator. Plus it leaves me an empty pocket now. Thanks Digitalchemy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game me and my brother have played in a while. It's fun and for all ages.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Best Movie Ever. Period. Can you say mind blown? So many different turns and twists that you never know what to expect next.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|O.K.  I'm not really a fan of Justin.  I used to like some of his singles but I never bought a whole album.  And Timbaland, don't even get me started.  I felt like his production ruined many people's music, including Nelly Furtado, JT, and all his other collaborators.<br /><br />The first few listens of the album were meh...Suit and Tie and Mirrors were good, but everything else sounded the same and long and boring.  A few plays later, however, I'm hooked onto this album.<br /><br />Timbaland has outdone himself.  Fantastic production with great beats here and there and changes in the sonic landscape within each song are simply brilliant.  JT finally gets to show his vocal talent and not ruined by unnecessary rapping like his previous songs.  Brilliant vocals, brilliant background vocals, brilliant falsetto.<br /><br />The album reminds me of Prince, Michael Jackson, and old 60s and 70s songs, but with a modern touch.  Standout tracks other than the singles include Tunnel Vision, Strawberry Bubblegum, Don't Hold the Wall, Let the Groove In, That Girl, well almost the whole album is great.  Now, where is the repeat button?
B0037QO8XE|5.0|Rented this movie for my girlfriend. It was a good movie overall. Precious gets hit with the worst that the inner city has to offer. Definitely worthy of a Golden Globe.
B0007PAMEM|4.0|Such energy does not come along too often. Tina is a legend in her own time as a solo artist. Ike,may you rest in peace.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great story.  I was anxious to continue reading as the story developed and suspense increased .  the Ending took me by surprise. Well worth reading.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Have enjoyed everything about the series.  Only hope we continue to get more television like this.  Good for everyone.  Event a little educational.
B002L7O7XG|1.0|The package ie the case of the DVD was cracked ,<br />We cannot play on our dvd player ,it can only play in old DVD player.<br />I would like to return it .
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was great! Starts off a little slow but quickly becomes addicting! Pat Peoples is a very interesting character who you grow to love an  care for.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I a disabled 61 year man and still am having fun with games,and this one is definitely FUN!  I played it last night for 3 hours!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I can't really do this game justice with my review. It is perfect. A perfect balance of brain testing and satisfaction. I will definitely be trying the other Quells. Levels are intricate, gameplay is smooth, and puzzle solutions are very logical and rewarding. I love the devices and traps in this game, and the puzzle names are often clever hints to the solution (I.e. Bodyguard; where one raindrop must take a hit for the other in order to succeed.) If you like puzzle games in the least, get this.
B00BW5K5DO|1.0|Downloaded the game, did not unstandstand it at all.  Could not get it to do anything. The  page opened, but that was all .
1885167776|5.0|I read about this new book by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan several months ago.  I was able to receive the \\"e-book\\" by pre-ordering the hard copy.<br /><br />I not only read the e-book, but participated in a Facebook book club every Sunday evening, each week covering successive chapters.  But, I wanted my book.<br /><br />I wanted it for reference, I am sure it will end up well worn as I refer to it time and again on my journey to mastery.<br /><br />This past week, I got my book, I love it.<br /><br />Thinking I will get it spiral bound like my well worn copy of the Millionaire Real Estate Agent.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for everyone, to enrich your personal and business life's.<br /><br />If you can choose only one book to read, besides the bible of course, read The One Thing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game I play on my kindle fire. me and my best friend Anthony ( squirm) play eryday....cant wait for the 7.0 update.
1451695195|5.0|Iwould highly recomment this book to anyone who is interested in the subject.A very thoughtful book and not at all preachie.
B008N9AASC|5.0|this movie just inspires me to get on my motorcycle and travel the planet, such a beautiful movie pure meditation
B00BESLHEA|1.0|Its quite clear Russell Crowe, a very good actor, did this for the money, because this one of the worst movies I have watched in a long time, poor story line, should have remained in country where it was filmed and kept in its native language because few people in this country will find anything enjoyable. Sorrry I actually spent money to watch this piece of crap film.
B003S5K8GK|5.0|I am sure this movie will get mixed views which will only serve to verify that racism still exists and there are plenty of people out there who have been so brainwashed that they are only shells of the innocence they came into the world with now.<br /><br />For those who wish for a peaceful world, who understand truly what freedom is, who know that to change the world you must first change yourself......<br /><br />For those who have their own views in life but accept humbly and openly the views of others, for those who say good morning to a stranger on the street when passing by (that eliminates 90% !)....<br /><br />For those who view another persons color... including white as just another color... as curious and interesting rather than harmful or wrong, for those who hear another person speak in their native language and don't think they are smarter or better.<br /><br />And lastly, for those who don't go around thinking they are better or smarter or more powerful because they live in a certain nation.......<br /><br />Then this will be perhaps the best movie you ever saw.....<br /><br />And I should have added... for those who don't tear a movie apart for technical reasons, but rather just accept the way it was made like you accept everyone, regardless of the way they are put together since each person is a different story just the way they are.........
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|I have to admit, I don't see how this book received such reviews. Newly-retired Harold takes a long walk and contemplates his life. This is not a new concept.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. Very easy to read and understand and would recommend this book to all ages. The diet that's easy to maintain for a lifetime.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The story line was great and the book was very well written. The series was gripping and kept me always wanting more. I would definitely recommend this book.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My grandchildren love this movie and can't wait for more.  Downloaded it for a fun watch for the evening.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
0307346617|5.0|This is a good book. Actually scary, written like an interview after the zombie war/invasion. Easy read, a lot of fun. It reads as if this could actually happen and that is what makes it creepy/cool.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm completely hooked on this series.  From the first episode of Season 1 through Season 3, I have watched each episode over a few times.  Love everything about it!
B000BZ9DKW|3.0|I bought this gift set because of all the accessories that come with the DVD.  The mouse pad, note pad, pen/pencil and photo frame are great.  The stapler is functional, but it's not actually a swingline.  That was a big bummer.
B009XTF8KQ|3.0|Watch it its ok not your falt you did not make the film.was a scary,but you could guest..thanks gail tailor
B005LLSZNM|5.0|SOA has become my favorite soap opera!! (albeit, a bad girl's soap!! :-) The continuing saga of Teller-Morrow has me hook, line and sinker! I am continuing my marathon of catch-up so I am ready for Season 6 when it begins---my only problem? I am gonna hate having to wait a week in between episodes!!
B00B6DTWM2|2.0|It started good than really got bad,special with his drinking,,and for being a writer,he was a dum.found tapes could'nt keep his s*** to gather for his family.to not even put a fight up for his family.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|perfect album :) love blake shelton and this album is his best yet!! Every song is so fun and so relatable...it's like he's just one of the of boys...
B009AMALGM|2.0|This movie was a big dispointement,,just something to make money real quick.When I think about it it suck,,,thay really make the ending bad,,....
B00BAVCD8A|3.0|The cd is amazing, I'm so glad fall out boy is back...however, I've always loved CDs over digital downloads, after getting the cardboard case that it's in I wish I had just gone with the mp3 because the case isn't going to last anyway. Amazon wasn't offering the free digital with it the day I ordered it and now they are but it won't let me download it since I bought it the day before the started the offer which is annoying to say the least. BUT Fall Out Boy is incredible...you can't go wrong here!
B0040I09RM|5.0|One of the best action/drama series that has ever been. Sapranos meets Fast and Furious and a lot of sex.
B00498YZH8|5.0|Everything about this film from the writing to the acting to the mise en scene is absolutely enthralling; you feel captured by the world of this film. Jennifer Lawrence is such a star in this film and playing a believable, tough-tongued 17 year old, I never knew it was up her alley.
B000FA675C|5.0|awesome great read could not put it down great writer. intriguing believable rapt from chapter to chapter highly recommended by me
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Just as fun as the original with so many more things to do and accomplish! You definitely have to be on your toes in this one!! Love it!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I've had two data cables chewed up by my dogs, so I ordered two extras. It also works for my LG Optoma phone, so I'll keep at least one extra around.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book. Nothing was expected. It was a very well written story. I could not put it down. Great ending as well.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|If you've ever seen Tom Selleck perform, you'll appreciate this movie.  Jesse Stone always gets the bad guys but the suspense is what makes all his movies so great.  I have my grandchildren hooked on the series and I would highly recommend a big bowl of popcorn, sit back and get ready to enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's an awesome game but.I think that they should leave the characters so you have a chance in getting them
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|I liked it. It is classic Tarantino. The acting, action, comedy were all good. I enjoyed it quite a bit.
B00358ESI4|5.0|It is a great movie. Inspiring, rushing, and the perfect action movie! I have already watched this multiple times. I recommend buying this
B00004U8P4|5.0|Love this movie !!
B00006AW2P|4.0|Early days but not better days. A couple of great tracks, some not so but a must have for Stones affectionardos
B0002MB7R6|5.0|I like this movie but the DVD don't filter the bad language I have a VCR that does so I bought the VHS tape......good service and came within a week thanks
B00006AW2S|4.0|More early Stones to fill some historical spaces before Let it Bleed, Beggars Banquet, Exile, Sticky ect ect ect ect.<br />If you don't want to buy it, at
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|A great preview of the modern age. Star Trek took our problems and conflicts into space and helped us see them in a different way.
B000002LEM|5.0|I bought this album for one track - &#34;Finish What You Started&#34;.<br />I'm happy to say that I've not had this album out of the machine since the day I got it.<br />I think all the Sammy H haters are being very harsh.<br />Personally, I don't care who sings as long as it sounds good to me
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is very fun, and with the incredible value is definitely a must have. Definitely great to have when waiting anywhere.
B00006AW2L|5.0|For me, this starts my favourite Stones era. They actually have something to say and don't mind what the civilised world thinks of their opinions
B008I3RARW|5.0|I put this on my device for the grandkids to play and they enjoy it !! So anything that helps them have fun it good.
B000002JSH|5.0|One of my favourite albums of all time. Tight and slick and as good a representation of the band as you'll get.<br />If you only have room for one Bad Co album in your collection get this one
B0050DIWFC|5.0|ALL I COULD DO IS PUT MYSELF IN THE PLACE OF THE PARENTS.  WHAT DO YOU DO?  THIS BOOK HELD MY INTEREST UNTIL THE VERY END.  GOOD STORY, GOOD WRITING.<br />ONE NOT TO MISS.
1455502626|5.0|I bought this book because of a cover blurb by Michael Connelly recommending it.  I thought if my favorite author enjoyed it, I would too.  That was one time I was very right.  Mr. DeMille is a talented author.  The pages fly by.  The story is engaging.  The character of John Corey is well crafted. I am surprised that Hollywood hasn't made a movie around him yet(although what are the odds they will do it justice?)  I have re-read this one a couple of more times over the years.  It's like revisiting an old friend.  The funny parts are still funny.  The story is still interesting.  Do yourself a favor and read this book and the John Corey series.  One note, do try to read the Corey books in order, it will be a huge help.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Daft Punk, Pharrell Williams, and Niles Rodgers have collaborated to bring this Nu-Disco song to life. This song has \\"no drop\\" and instead has a smooth groove that keeps your feet moving or your head bobbing. In short I believe Daft Punk has restored what music really is about and the lyrics (while not a lot of lyrics) capture what music and dancing used to be about. Everyone now days wants instant results and want to get to the end right away. This song shows you the journey can mean more than the ending.<br /><br />While usually most Daft Punk songs have had no other artists with them, this works really well. The song is about the funk and groove, which Pharrell captures in his voice, and Niles does on his guitar track. Even with these two additions into the Daft Punk world, Daft Punk kept their sound and feel to it so you know its them.<br /><br />I believe this is a classic (can't wait for the full version of this song) and you should definitely buy it!
B00BEJL3IY|1.0|There is a whole sub-community of movie executives who will farewell their Hollywood careers when, as most assuredly it will, this film plummets like a clumsy giant out of the sky on its general release to the public.<br /><br />For, unlike the last film I can remember being this wretched (Danny Glover's Age of the Dragons) Bryan Singer's Jack the Giant Slayer was not released straight to video, its producers having first been taken out and shot.<br /><br />Here rather more is at stake, at least if the fanfare that accompanied its preview screening is anything to go by. They erected a 20 foot high climbing wall outside the cinema to mark the launch. Since the screening took place in Leicester Square on St. Patrick's Day amidst a throng of drunken Irish revellers, this was a misjudgment all of its own.<br /><br />Other than Age of the Dragons (and, let's face it, \\"Moby Dick. On land. With dragons. Starring Vinnie Jones\\" is quite a benchmark), I can't remember a film quite so bankrupt in its basic concept. The idea seems to have been to take anything of note in the fantasy genre of recent times - there are hat tips to The Princess Bride, The Hobbit, How To Train Your Dragon, Beowulf, Prometheus and Immortals among many others - and to stitch them together in the expectation that it might all fly. Jack the Giant Slayer therefore has a cloying excess just about everything.<br /><br />Except smut. Smut is fully absent without official leave. Great Scott, it's a pantomime! Jack and the Beanstalk begs for double entendre! Its bizarre omission calls to mind Danny McBride's childishly excellent Your Highness, a film almost entirely comprised of innuendo and which, like no other, illustrates just how redemptive a willy joke can be.<br /><br />In the meantime, the story is a hodgepodge of English fairy tales. Despite being named for \\"Jack the Giant Killer\\" (\\"killer\\" nixed because the focus group didn't like the word \\"killer\\" and didn't understand the concept \\"synonym\\") this is mostly a reprise of Jack & the Beanstalk. Only better, I suspect its screenwriting collective thought (this is a collective whose collected output, by the way, is enough to induce dizziness, cold sweats and vomiting).<br /><br />And of course it isn't better. It can't be. Jack & The Beanstalk is an archetypal fairy story with the kernel of a decent drama, but in no reasonable man's conception could it stretch for two hours (not, at least, without a cross-dressing Widow Twanky somewhere along the way). So the collective has drowned out the elemental aspects of the story with additional tropes and dog-eared routines of the idiom, whilst egregiously forgetting the all-important transvestitism.<br /><br />Now excuse a digression into literary theory, but in this fairy story there is a hero (Jack), a monster (one giant), a perfidious interlocutor who, through shortsightedness, meanness, hubris or stupidity provides the impetus for the hero to be uncaged (a stepmother who angrily throws away the beans for which Jack has stupidly traded his cow). It is simple stuff, and has a whopping great cock of metaphor quite literally rooted right in the middle of everything, yet the moral of the story is unusual for a \\"hero overcoming the monster\\" story: be careful what you wish for. Sometimes your vaulting ambition can come back to bite you. Here the screenplay entirely futzes that simple premise. There are several candidates for villain - an entire tribe of Ulstermen giants (in a land and at the top of a beanstalk, by the way, so graphically rendered as to compel close literal examination of a metaphor which isn't up to such scrutiny. Wouldn't everyone have, like, noticed a huge landmass floating in the sky? Wouldn't it always be dark below? Wouldn't things spontaneously fall off it from time to time (as indeed they start to once the action gets underway)? Would the land below really look just like the Home Counties in summertime?<br /><br />The screenwriters have invented a backstory for the giants which further compromises the fable. They're subject to a mythical ring (or crown, depending on your hat size), to the bearer of which they must pledge automatic fealty. This allows further candidate for supreme Villain when dastardly Roderick (Stanley Tucci), one of the King's men, gets hold of the ring, waves it at a horde of onrushing giants, and they all at once bow down to him without further discussion.<br /><br />And just as the giants seem improbably captive of one little midget, director Bryan Singer seems captive of, his special effects department. The film is in 3D, a fad which elsewhere seems thankfully pass&eacute;, is lit darkly anyway, and they have made the curious decision to entirely animate the giants (per Beowulf, rather than augmenting live performances per Lord of the Rings) using quite dated rendering technology. Perhaps we have reached the limit what the CGI wizards can do, and there is hope for the Film Actors Guild after all. In any case Bill Nighy isn't recognisable as the Giant with the Belfast accent and the extra head.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our anaemic young hero Jack (Nicholas Hoult) does his best with no obvious fibre and only an anaemic princess (Eleanor Tomlinson) to win over, whom the giants are (specifically, for some reason) hell-bent on eating (notwithstanding that such a skinny little whelp would, to a giant, have the size and consistency of a cockroach).<br /><br />We arrive at a final dramatic conclusion at the Castle (I know, I know, *what* castle?) wherein King (*what* King?) Brahmwell (Ian McShane), in possibly the most woeful piece of miscasting in motion picture history, is obliged to partake in a twenty minute tug of war with a giant cabbage-patch doll while dressed in a suit of armour made of 24 carat gold lam&eacute; that even Julian Clary wouldn't be seen dead in. McShane, to his credit, looks singularly unamused, adopting the expression of a Candid Camera victim immediately prior to being let in on the gag.<br /><br />As of the time of writing the film hadn't recouped half its estimated production costs in a month or so of general American release. Thus I hope Ian McShane and his cohort of celebrated English actors got paid in hard currency in advance - because the merchandising rights ain't going to be worth Jack.<br /><br />Olly Buxtontory for the giants which further compromises the fable.

B008LC8TJI|5.0|Amazing songs...love them all.  Saw the concert and was in front row in front of Adam!!1<br />I would highly recommend this cd.  A+++
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game was fairly basic.  There was only one or two actions in each scene.  Most of game was simply a hidden object search, which were fairly easy.  Still it was a fun game to play.  I give it a slightly lower score due to not being very challenging.
B009IRVSVQ|1.0|my kids, 7 and 12, love Bruno Mars, so I bought this so we could listen in the car.  This was all about sex and lots of cursing.  What a waste.  Totally not appropriate.  Actually, I didn't even enjoy listening to it on my own.
0380807343|5.0|Coraline tells the fascinating story of young Coraline Jones, a smart, feisty, curious and adventurous young girl who is somewhat neglected by her workaholic yet loving parents, a young-en who craves a measure of parental involvement but who also values her sense of independence. Unfortunately, however, she is more alone rather than independent. It depends on how a reader interprets solitariness. But for Coraline Jones, that is all a-OK, but there is an undercurrent of resentment that she feels towards her parents. She does not allow those feelings to dominate her.<br /><br />Having recently moved to a new home with new residents all around, Coraline becomes an explorer of the unchartered territory, somewhat to the relief of her parents, who must press on with creating a catalog that must be completed before their deadline. On a rainy day, Coraline becomes housebound, much her dismay, but it permits her the opportunity to explore the inner sanctums of her new home. Before that, though, she visits Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two aging former performers who are roommates in another section of Coraline's giant house. They read her tea leaves and warn her that she is in danger, but from what, is not exactly discernible. The warning is alarming to Coraline, but she is intrigued at the same time, especially after being given a unique stone with a hole in it by the two ladies; they attest  that it has a special power to it that will be beneficial to Coraline. With that, the true adventure begins.<br /><br />Roaming about, Coraline finds an entranceway into another world where everything pretty much looks the same but appears to be of a higher caliber, including her own parents. But they are parents with black buttons for eyes. Questioning but overlooking the anomalies, Coraline quickly becomes adapted to and enamored with this new yet mysterious world. There are enticements, assuaged egos, desires fulfilled in this land, all the trapping that a person-particularly a child-would think they would want. Yet there is something missing, and it is a very simple yet powerful ingredient. It is love and all the facets that make love what it is: sacrifice, nurturing, discipline, empathy, free will, etc. While everything is seemingly perfect in this netherworld, for that is what it is, it is all a disingenuous yet harmonized quasi life based upon faux unity; it is a life and environment that is tailored together by darkness, madness, insatiable greed and lies and so much more. And while there is a sense of animated coolness to this whole other realm, it is, nonetheless, a dark world that belies its hidden dangers, dangers that have already ensnared a plethora of child souls long before Coraline ever came into the scene. And now that Coraline is in the scene, she is the demonic mother's new favorite pet, a creature, not a soul, to dote on. But how long will the doting continue on for?  Will Coraline be fooled? Can she discern the true love verses the snares of the evil one? She is a clever child, but kids can be fooled. Who will win?<br /><br />Coraline was a thoroughly enjoyable read, a simple and unadorned work that was very much plot driven. The straightforward ebb and flow of dialog and action conveyed a powerful and timely lesson, a truth, really, for all times. If anyone ever read Gaiman's The Graveyard Book, they will most definitely enjoy Coraline and vise versa. Additionally, the film adaption of Coraline was very true to the book. Either way, they were both entertaining works.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very good! Played well on my 7 inch Kindle Fire. Hints and guide provided. Bonus section just as good as the game. Not that scary. Great story. And the girl rescues the guy!

B005NPCJ88|5.0|I bought the album expecting to hear something like &#34;War Is The Answer&#34;. Well, you start to get into it and then it changes a little. If your like me and have only heard the &#34;War Is The Answer&#34; album and a few other songs from them that are good, it might take a time or two before you like it. The first time I listened to it I was like &#34;Ehh, it's alright&#34;. But after leaving it in my CD player for a few days listening to it constantly I fell in love with it. The lyrics, the guitar tracking, the voice, the melodies that you want are all there. You may not here them at first, but the second or third time around you should come to love this album as I did. It's a must have for FFDP fans.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This app is great for reading, or searching for scriptures and or phrases. The issue that I have is I would prefer to have more than one reader on the audio. The bible.is app by faith comes by hearing is a great app with dramatic audio, but it would not work on my kindle fire, so youversion it is. If you don't mind the monotone audio, this is a great app.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|By song:<br /><br />Supremacy<br />One of the best, dynamic vocals and song structure<br /><br />Madness<br />Good slower song that picks up, a lot of electronic music here<br /><br />Panic Station<br />Almost as good as the first song, though it is mostly the same throughout, swears once<br /><br />Prelude<br />Slow and calming, not as good with a bad audio system<br /><br />Survival<br />Dynamic sounding, opening sounds like a queen song a little, does feel like it is constantly building up to something<br /><br />Follow Me<br />Some good sections, much is meh.<br /><br />Animals<br />Meh, though towards the end there is a nice breakdown with a crown track<br /><br />Explorers<br />Nice as a backround track, not much to focus on here though.<br /><br />Big Freeze<br />Seems a little like a running song, nothing outstanding here, though a nice song<br /><br />Save me<br />Not a fan of long drawn out vocals, so kind of a boring song for me.<br /><br />Liquid State<br />Also seems like a running song (I don't even run, so not sure why, I guess it just has that beat.) Alright song.<br /><br />Unsustanable<br />Some kind of dubstep with string sections that manages to be much more graceful than your typical Skrillex. Love the comeputer voice.<br /><br />Isolated System<br />Really just a nice backbeat with vocals over it. Still really like it though<br /><br />I don't often do reviews, but these are just my impressions of the songs.<br /><br />BUY IT
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Marvel's The Avengers is a fun movie.  Joss Whedon tied the loose ends of the Marvel franchise together very well, with incredibly entertaining results.  He gave each hero the spotlight and entertained the audience, long-time fan and newbie alike.  My whole family enjoys this movie, so I downloaded it to my new Kindle Fire.  Love it!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This show is one of those shows where when you watch the first episode, you want to watch to see what happens with the rest of the episodes.  I am early into the first season, but so far, this is a show that seems to have it all.  Action, suspense, betrayal and the women are as tough as the men!
0062267787|2.0|It kind of seems like this was just a way to make a little more money from the series.  And the &#34;new&#34; info about Raven at least didn't even make it into the last book.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved the first book in this series and I loved the next book. I will be reading the next book in this series and I.can't wait
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Started out interesting but them it lost me . I have tried to finesh reading it but I put it down every time . It does not hold my interest.
B0035JLVWY|3.0|Interesting plot. Acting was hokey and a bit annoying, especially Richard Gere sniffing his indignity or amusement or just generally. Twist at the end was no big surprise. But I did watch it to the end.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I had hear  of this book but never had the chance to read. It's very enthralling though written in a different time.  Good for children or young at heart to 're a d.
0553278223|5.0|In my view one of the best scifi books ever written, my absolute favorite, which even surpasses Arthur C. Clarke 2001. The sort of book you wish never ended.
B00BY9GQHM|2.0|There's not much background to the storyline.  It's mostly hidden pictures with very simplistic puzzles thrown in randomly  Very little challenge.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Acting and scenery were superb.  Human natures as well as natures forced upon some are enlightening.  Wife and I began to feel part of the action.  An historical, gigantic soap opera.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is easy and fun  you can have friends and they can help you out it is hard to get use to at first but once you get the hang of it is so much fun try it for yourself
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I would recommend this version to any Twilight Fan.  The Extended Edition was worth the wait.  The extra eight minutes make the movie make more sense..
B00AKO93JK|3.0|The work outs are good but need to have more exercises.  When I try to move to harder exercises it wants me to buy more.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Can't wait to see the next episode!  Each episode has something to offer in life lessons. Absolutely love it!  The characters are amazing!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|What a joy to be able to read Kindle books on my android tablet.  This is the most used app on my tablet.  I get library books with my Kindle app.  Easy to read and works 100% of the time.  Easy to book mark.  Makes font large, too!  Love it.
0143039881|5.0|If you are into history, then you need to read this book, please keep an open mind, as you never learned  what your about to read in history class in school.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This calendar works seamlessly with my Google calendar and syncs easily.  I keep the widget on my home page of my tablet so I can glance on current days' tasks without opening my calendar.  The full size calendar is neat and easy to use.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Finally finished this book after purchasing it four months ago.  This novel is worthy of five stars for the extensive character development, the extreme level of detail, and its ability to lure me in and literally make me feel like I am consistently standing over Grace's shoulder from beginning to end.  And what an end!!  I deducted one star because I, personally, did not really start enjoying the plot line until more than half way through... And for an almost 500 page novel, that's a lot of patience for me.  There is vast development of characters, environment, time period, etc.  VAST.  Once I got through that and into the meat of the book. I finished it in two days.  Almost four months for half the book and two days for second half.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is so cool.  I no longer carry my study Bible to church.  Very easy to find passages.  I can bookmark passages as I read.  Very convenient to have my Bible with me all the time!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This DVD brings one of the best romances I have ever seen.  Loved the interaction between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.  Thanks to the bookstore that made sure we got our purchase on time.
0525952926|5.0|Another great novel from Ken Follett. I've read book one this one is coming up and then waiting for #3.
B0052UYJDC|3.0|This book inspired me to be more simple and to think less of material things.<br />The only thing I find off putting is the overly conscientious zeal for contributing less to<br />the environmental footprint everybody is talking about now a days. Too much influence by the hype of the media and politicians.
1451627289|5.0|A FANTASTIC book, it's one I would read again even though it's close to 1000 pages in length. One of the best I've read in the last year.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|This is a wonderful compilation.  At first I thought I might have all or most of these songs but it turns out many are recordings from different performances and even if they weren't it still show cases Duane's body of work really well. Duane's sound and technique is remarkable even today and to think he was so young when he accomplished all this. You will be left with that haunting feeling that Duane and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm section always leave you with from the recordings of the late 60's early 70's. I had that feeling when I first heard &#34;Loan Me a Dime&#34;. Even The Allman Brothers tracks have something different as many are from different performances too.<br /><br />I may be wrong but I think there are approximately 114 tracks on this Retrospective. What is also nice is that he played with so many great artists that you can just put this on and listen for as long as you like and not feel like you have ever had enough. This is largely because every artist has a different style or feel. Duane stamps his moniker on every track. Putting it simply, Duane just had this way of making any song he participated on sound better. It is not about pyro techniques it is about musicality. Duane's technique was special anyway but his musicality was exceptional and very rare.<br /><br />I would highly recommend The Duane Allman Retrospective&#34; to first time listeners or even to someone who thinks they have just about every track Duane played on as there is something for everyone here and you will just have a relaxing great time listening to each era as it passes by.<br /><br />Bill Levenson and Galladrielle Allman should be very proud of this outcome.  This Album should have been put together years ago but as I understand it from both Bill's an Galladrielle's interview in &#34;Hit 'n' the Note&#34; it was quite difficult to get all the permissions to use many of these tracks from the various recording labels. Anyway it is in the Domain now and well done to both Billand Galladrielle and all that took part in its making really.<br /><br />PS.<br />I have been Goggling on YouTube recently and found some amazing footage of the Line-up of &#34;The Allman Brothers Band&#34;. It would have been really great to have a small DVD included with some of the really good quality footage as they do on many compilations these days but alas.<br /><br />PPS.<br />I live in Australia in relatively small country area and have always wanted to see The Allman Brothers Band. I finally got to do that at the Beacon Theatre in New York this year (2013) as I was visiting my daughter who lives in New York. I have one negative comment about the show and that was the sound was very “boomy” and it was very difficult to hear separation between instruments. What I was hoping to be a really great night was let down by that and by the fact that we could not see much as everyone stood up. Maybe I am getting too old. Ha. Not to take away from Derek Trucks and Warren Haynes I do think the band does lack the feel that Dickey brings. That is not to say you can’t move on it is just a groove. Still a great evening overall and I am glad I ticked that one off my list. 
B009XY97VC|4.0|This third release from TSFH is good, and better than most in this genre, but it fails (slightly) to capture the same Epic majesty of the previous two releases.  If you already own the Invincible & Archangel albums then feel confident that this is another &#34;must-buy&#34; album as well.  If you are a new to Two Steps From Hell, then you should really grab either of his previous releases first.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Great first season..loved watching it at my leisure. I love Amazon prime Tv shows and movies. I was able to cancel my cable.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I loved Season 3. So many twists and turns, I never knew what was going to happen next!  And I can't wait to see what happens in Season 4.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I enjoyed Season 1 of Voyager.  The season has quite a few of the &#34;moral questions&#34; issues that were famous in the original Star Trek and expanded upon in &#34;TNG.&#34;  Video feed from Amazon Prime is top notch.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Love the movie. Didn't love how the video stopped throughout the movie. At times I had to start it over again to finish watching it. If you charge expensive prices for others to rent your movies, make sure it plays accordingly so your customers can get their monies worth.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin is a wonderful writer. This is the way to understand just what went on in the Lincoln administration.
B0091REZMW|5.0|i love this game just whet I needed to keep me occupied... the hidden objects is definitely my strong point... i love finding things... the tutorial was a little long though
B0012IWNWW|5.0|If you're into Pink Floyd and especially Dark Side of the Moon (what rock fan isn't?) this is a great DVD - lots of information I didn't know. I ordered it &#34;Used - like new&#34; and that's what it is - like new. The delivery was very quick - I'd definitely deal with this vendor again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|excellent series.  keeps your interest,  many, many sub-plots with vey interesting characters.  show subtly shows what happens during changing times.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|I loved this movie so much I had to buy it on Blue Ray and I bought the Regular DVD version for my son as a  birthday gift, including the sound track cd
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Mr. Howey has truly done a great job with this series! The series is a pleasure to read and constantly maintains the reader's attention. He is a gifted author; the series is easily worth much more than the current cost. I will be adding him to my favorite authors list and purchasing other books that he writes.<br />Highly recommended!
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|Maybe it is just my fat fingers but it is difficult to get the various pieces assembled the way I want them to. Graphics are good though.
B00ABO609A|3.0|This just a good filler movie when you have nothing else to watch, because it got a weird plot of a guy who picks wrong relationships, and obsesses over them.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It is a fun game that helps pass the time. The levels are challenging without being overly frustrating. I plan to finish all the levels.
B0012FHGCW|2.0|Heard this was a good movie so I watched it. After the first hour, I kept looking at the clock, waiting and wanting it to end.  The story was good, but the movie was way to long.  They could have cut it down by a good hour, and made it much better!
B009WHDDZQ|4.0|I suppose the whole purpose of the expedition, was so the old fart could extend his life. Weylan met his creator and the creator was hell bend to genocide all of mankind. We are just a mistake! Oh well.....
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I'm generally a Jane Austen fan, love Pride and Prejudice especially, and found Persuasion to be equally as good. Want to see the movie now!
B00555X8OA|5.0|Excellent book . Easy to understand and very thought provoking.<br />The way the book was written made it easy to follow the concepts.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Very good quality on the blu-ray restoration. Bought on sale for $20. Worth the purchase if you do not own a copy of the trilogy yet.
B00BP4X3W2|4.0|we ended up watching this movie with our teenager since it was a school project....she had read the book and wanted to see the movie. It was a sad movie but it helped her very much since its one thing reading the book and then seeing the movie.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I missed Life of Pi when it came out in movies. I am glad I was able to watch in the privacy of my home with family. A very spiritual movie with great messages.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It's always amazing to me when a writer can tell a story with a very well-known ending, and still make it dramatic and exciting.  Mark Owen's No Easy Day is that kind of book.  Of course we all know the ending, but I found myself sweating as he described the minutes leading up to and during the operation that killed Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />I loved some of the commentary on politicians.  Especially his remark that Joe Biden is like your drunk uncle.  LOL!<br /><br />I give the book only 4 stars because I think he went a little too far on the training.  I found myself a little disinterested in the middle of the book just waiting for the action to get going.  I get it, Seals are badasses...move on.
B00B22IJXK|2.0|Very disappointed with this app. Gives you less than basic input for pictures and drawing. Too hard to really draw well for lack of smaller tips for pen selection and choice selection is too cumbersome to use. You need to flick a dial to select colors...that is just a waste of time. Picture editor is lame with just the bare minimum of filters. If you just want an app that may possibly occupy a three year old...this is it. Otherwise, listen to the other reviewers... don't bother with this app. IMO you could find something better and for free! I'd been real upset if I actually paid for this. Glad I didn't!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Best of the series for sure, a little bit of a battle royale rip but I'm sure this has been said before.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|I have seen various stories about the Tuskegee Airmen. I enjoyed this one greatly. It was well told, cinematically beautiful and the characters seemed to come alive. This is a great addition to my DVD collection. If you are a war buff and a history lover, this movie will be a treat to view.
B003XNTTYY|4.0|Sandersons stuff is usually pretty inventive with magic but this series really had me. Some great characters and epic fight scenes
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I absolutely love the newest Volbeat album, as I love all their other albums. Volbeat can do no wrong in my opinion; there is not one song of their that I dislike.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|We are not big Dreamworks fan's but we did enjoy this movie very much! This was a very good movie using the different holiday characters.  It is one of our favorite's!
B000MD9UJC|4.0|I really appreciate the fast service that I got, I only wish that nite ize would raise their level of quality. The upgrade kit did work,  just a little too\\"cheap\\" feeling.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I love to see how technology has changed and how some of Star Trek has come to be.<br />Thank you
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE Pinterest, at first I didn't get it. Then I got it, now I'm on it all the time. I look for recipes most often.
1481130331|4.0|'The Luck of the Weissensteiners' is the story of a family. We begin in Bratislava before WWII and follow Jonah and his family as they ride the wave of Jewish hatred flowing out of Nazi Germany and then the anti-German feeling as the allies arrive.<br /><br />This fictional family experience many of the difficulties people in Europe were facing at this time. It was a time of great change of country borders and leaders and with it came violence, hatred and a huge displacement of ordinary people. Having only my mother's stories of life during the Blitz in London and my father's stories and papers of his time fighting in Italy and North Africa on which to base my knowledge of this time, Fischer opened up for me a European view of life around WWII.<br /><br />Well researched and jam packed with history, there were times I wanted to get closer to the characters and how they felt...there's a lovely scene where Greta is working in a library and I would have liked more of that feeling in the book but that's just personal preference. Similarly, for me, the dialogue seemed more factual than realistic but Fischer tells an interesting, well-written and well edited story and I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />If you love your history, you'll love this book. I have no hesitation in giving it 4*.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Such great writing, with the overarching theme, delivered weekly, of Who are we, at core?  If someone in an alternate universe shares our DNA, how much is he or she like us?  How similar are twins to each other?  Would we know a loved one who shared the DNA of an imposter -- could we tell the difference between the two nearly-similar people?  How much of who we are is genetic, how much our experiences?<br />And finally, for fun, what are the ethics of traveling between parallel universes?<br />Enjoy,<br />Lydia
B002SRQ214|5.0|What can I say, it's a processor. It suits my needs. Much better than the old way of processing data via pen and paper.
B00063F8B2|5.0|Theese are good songs from the movie which is also good. Of course ones like Its Beginning to Look a Like Christmas and White Christmas are very famaiar but ones like When Christmas Comes to Town and The Polar Express were obviously written for the movie. You should get it. Merry Christmas.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book! Vivid details brings the story to life! Hanging on top every word as these pages turned. Excellent  novel!
B002VPE1WK|3.0|The bag seems big. It would be good if you have alot of lenses to carry around but if you are a beginner a smaller bag will do.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Again read the reviews before mine and I cant believe how some are ..But I already read the books, 3 times :) I'm not into all the sex games these two play into but I have to say I'm lost and captivated in them finding each others balances.I wont feel guilty for it I never smiled so much or turned so red while sitting on my couch from just reading a book..I know crazy rite..Well that just means it was great!! And I can say I was drawn to the appearance of what he was about..
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I enjoyed the book, but i feel the reader needs to have read all the earlier series books to understand it  and also be older as it is much darker than the rearly one
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Well all good things have to come to an end .. I enjoyed each book what I'd do if that kind of experience was a chose mmmm I don't know but boy i felt a lot through these books it was a great out come in this book with Christian to finally let go and they were able to find a balance,kept my attention great mix of drama passion and romance can't wait for the movie although I'm sure it wont meet up to the books but I hope it will be close..I'm sure to reread them again even know I'm sure some would say 3 is enough but how can u get enough of Christian hehe :) A very great trilogy must read !
B00BWHZI0C|5.0|This is a great album from star to finish. Ive been listening to for three days straight and stillgoing strong.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well reading all the other reviews I giggled..I read this book and the other two a while ago just haven't got to writing a review yet..But with that said I've read them each 3 times and I just cant help my self I really fell for them..I fell hard I was captivated in the first book by christian my self I had to keep reading and yes I had to know what he was going to offer and wow it threw me and caught me in his web all at the same time..So that brought me to the 2nd book ..Which brought me to more shades then a can count :)
B005KQVDH8|5.0|What more need I say? The movies still holds up after over two decades.  Now I have it on Blu-Ray to complete my Goonies collection.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkjjjhhf hmmmm the conversation about you that I interested in the conversation
B001JRB16U|5.0|Mary Poppins is a classic and my children enjoy this movie as much as I did at their age. Highly recommended
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this is sooo stuipied I do not reconend this who have the kindal fire now I cant say this for the kindal fire hr but any way I wolnt load and when I have been sitting there for forever WAITing for it to load it justccompletly exited the game :(
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This one is the cream of the crop. Still tops my Schwarzenegger films.  It has everything you are looking for in an action film.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|SUPER COOL. SURPRISE ENDING BUT SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLE. LOVED THE STORY AND THE SUSPENSE. NOT SCARY JUST SUSPENSEFUL. I ENDED UP FEELING BAD FOR THE BAD GUY LOL
B001UN1KVE|5.0|One of my favorite Mel Brooks films.  Spaceballs makes me laugh out loud every time I see it.  May the Schwartz be with you.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|To be honest, I wasn't expecting much so I most likely enjoyed this more because of that. Almost makes me want to pay for cable again...almost.<br /><br />The stories are fairly simple and the plot is predictable most of the time. But it's still very fun to watch and enjoy.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Willow has been one of my favorite films of all time.  Val Kilmer is excellent in this movie and I am glad I picked up the Blu-ray/DVD combo.  Now my kids can enjoy this film with me like when I was their age.
B0098VXMNE|4.0|Although I didn't like Liam McIntyre as much as Andy Whitfield (to me you can tell Liam was trying much harder to talk in a certain way and he seemed more pompous as Spartacus than Andy did). However it is still a great season to just sit and watch and enjoy.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|...that's why I bought it.  Seriously, do I even have to explain that? I'm also pleased with the quality of this DVD :-)
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Sinatra at his finest with great musicians behind him. Wonderful arrangements of great songs. Timeless masterpieces that I listen to repeatedly.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Huge Fringe fan and I am enjoying it even more the 2nd time through! I can't wait to watch the other seasons.
157421327X|5.0|This is a great book to help you get started with Zentangles. While it covers the basics as the name implies, it also helps you think ahead and extends your interest.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This was a wonderful book<br />Plenty of complex characters,I see being developed in the future.  I can't wait until the next book comes out.  I see this as the next great adventure in a long line of books I've read over the past 30 years.
B006O2QNOU|5.0|Yes, I would recommend this movie to anyone who just loves movies.  I never heard of Margin Call until I go the Prime membership and started looking at the free movies.  This was a very good movie for Kevin Spacey.  I like him anyway, but he was great in this movie.  A must see drama. If you liked him in Casino Jack, you will like him in this movie too!!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My 4 year old grandchildren love this game and will play it over and over.  One of the best games I have downloaded on my kindle for them to play. Educational and fun to play.  Highly recommend it.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|Fun game, not difficult to learn. Nice looking, pretty colors. Liked that it had a tutorial. Most games you have to figure out on your own.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I can't believe I didn't watch this when it aired but its better now because I can watch them back to back. It would be agonizing to wait a week to see the next episode because the subplots are all so intriguing. I didn't watch &#34;The Commish&#34; and hadn't seen Michael Chiklis before so I had no opinion about him going in. But I'm only half way through Season 3 and he's already become one of my favorite actors. The character he creates, Vic Mackey, is remarkable and any time he's on screen something interesting is happening. Watching these for free on Amazon Prime is a treat and basically pays for a year of the Prime Membership. What a great find!
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|This movie, when compared to the previous two Daniel Craig Bond-movies fell short of expectations.  I thought Craig was great reprising his role as Commander Bond, but I thought the script wasn't all that great.  I wanted the writers to continue with the Illuminati story.  It's worth a watch if you enjoy Bond movies since I feel like there are relevant story points.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great simple calculator. It is not a good scientific calculator. That is why I rated it only 4 stars. Thanks for a great tool.
B00796E7CA|4.0|I highly highly highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed The Silmarillion.  This provides amazing insight into the First Age, as well as the Second Age (which I never really knew much about) as well as the Third. It's very interesting and it reads like all these events ACTUALLY happened.  Please read this story.
B007A05DW8|5.0|It is a great recording on 180g vinyl.  You don't get tired of listening to good recorded music.  I highly recommend this one
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great show! Will buy all season when available. After Lost and Walking Dead this is the show you must watch.
B00AUBNFEW|5.0|If you like jazz then this album is a must for your collection .  A true audiophile recording.  Your gonna love it
B00BN2NY48|5.0|Just wish the HD came in better.  It was nice to see all the different acts around the country.  Never get to see that at these prices.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the series! Was able to watch right away, Good quality Video. Good sound. Can't wait for the next season to come out.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is so entertaining and very addictive just making your own city. I love indefinitely recommend you buy it you will love it no matter what age
B0030IIZ56|5.0|We love all of the Toy Story movies, especially this one with the introduction of Jessie and Bullseye! We bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and it is a fun movie with unforgettable characters!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Inventory editing, infinite health, game mode changing, this app can do it all, for FREE! I can give myself full diamond armour or give me blocks that you aren't even meant to have like water and lava, all in SURVIVAL! One thing to remember-if you are going to edit something, always exit out of the world before you edit anything. I would also recommend the bought version, which you can spawn MOBS and more. I love this app!!<br /><br />~iTz Samu
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Love the graphics in this movie. I didn't know if we would like it in 3D, but it is definitely one of the best movies I've watched on our 3D tv! Definitely would recommend this product!
B001KT6JPA|4.0|The acting cannot be outdone.  It is superb! The series is a good way to spend a night or two.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I really enjoyed the theme song.  One of the best ever songs.  Something was missing from the Bond movies and I can't fall for it.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|great plots, character development and cast. as good as any of the shows on cable, without the graphic violence, language, etc.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|This album is the best i've heard from Fall Out Boy and if you are a fan BUY IT you won't be sorry!!
B004NELBPC|1.0|What goes wrong with these updates? They take a perfectly good app and in the name of and &quot;up grade&quot;. . .actually de-grade it!
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown at his finest. suspence abouds in this read. If you enjoy fiction mixed with thruth you will enjoy. Many facts have been proven true after this went to print. The church has admitted there error in reguards to the knight templars. Set down and enjoy this one
B007704HO6|5.0|The writer has grace and a very keen eye to every detail in cat behaviour. I truly recommend to every cat owner (or those who intend to have one...)!
B004HWT6DO|1.0|I was really looking forward to viewing this movie but despite the \\"excellent\\" connection I had it wouldn't stream more than a couple of minutes. I would like my money back and the hours it took to view this movie and I still haven't finished it.... I guess NetFlix just does it better. Amazon prime movie streaming is a terrible disappointment, Amazon isn't the best at everything, stick to your strengths -books.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|Don't understand why this movie didn't do better at box office.  Think it was poorly distributed.  Excellent performances by all.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This game is SWEET... The only twist is it's alot like The Oregon trail... It's fine with me if its from the same compony. THIS GAME IS FREE!!! Don't listen to anyone who says its isn't.  RATE 5 FOR ME IF YOUR READING THIS... plz...  : l
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|The performances were all top caliber except for Russell Crowe.  Story was relayed well through the film.  Found the fact that actors did singing LIVE to be very interesting.  Darker than the stage production but anyone who enjoyed the stage version should enjoy this as well.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a great family friendly movie that was actually extremely funny and had a great message with it. Definitely a must see!
B003L77V3S|5.0|Not only did he have an exciting eventful life--he knew how to write about as a novel unfolding.  First rate
0062200909|5.0|This is the most expensive book I've bought, but I love \\"The Hobbit\\" and saw all the great reviews, so I bought it. The front cover is so beautiful. It's feels like leather with a beautiful design on the front.<br />The content is breathtaking and you lose yourself in the pictures and descriptions for hours. A must buy for Hobbit lovers :)
B003JHKORK|5.0|Loved the movie.  There are some changes from the book, as is to be expected.  I wish it was closed captioned.
B008476HBM|4.0|The language throughout the book is intricate and formal, I loved the creative formal use of words throughout the book. The storyline was intriguing; however, somewhat predictable. Overall, a well-structured and convincing novel.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Three stories. Plots that tell the conclusion without actually telling the reader the  conclusion. Looking now for a full length novel by Connelly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Passes time when there's nothing to do. Fun variety of games for people young and old. My favorite game is the crazy burger game.
B00979OL5A|1.0|After great expectations for this game I am very disappointed.  The excellent graphics and unique interface made the game a pleasure to play and I was looking forward to many hours of enjoyment.  Unfortunately, after downloading the first couple of levels and paying for the next level I realized that I was going to have to pay for each level after that.  I don't mind paying for a game and realize the developers should make a profit from their work but at that rate the game would have cost a lot more than it was worth.  I think it was the way that they try to &#34;sucker&#34; you into getting involved and then make you pay to continue that ruined it for me.  If they had said at the beginning that the game was going to cost $15 at the beginning I would have been glad to pay the one time fee but I won't be tricked into paying as I go.  Too bad.
0345803485|5.0|This is one the greatest books of all time. I have been engulfed in this book for a weeka nd I am looking forward to reading the other ones.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I found the game to be fun to play and very challenging towards the end.  It has provided several weeks of enjoyable game play on my tablet.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show, I love that the main characters are human beings with flaws.  True character is how you act when no one is watching, these people wrestle with that just like the rest of us.
B005LAIH54|3.0|I like this kind of movie because of the nature of the movie.  Blood, guts, hero saves maiden, hero succeeds despite odds, all of it are good guy stuff, not for the ladies at all as it is very romantic but has little romance in it, kinda like a good western from the 50s.  I now have all the Titan movies.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Daughter in law, 10 weeks ago, turned me on to Jack Reacher fiction.  Wow! What a page turner.  Now for more.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I will be purchasing the DVD when it is released. If you have a media player and want to watch an episode you don't have on DVD or DVR this is the way to go.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I looked at this book so many times before I bought it - I think the cover is so cool that it always caught my eye! But the story is so much more then I ever imagined and I'm so glad I waited bc I finished it right when Walking Disaster was released.  It really is a story that you finish and you want to restart again.  Really hope this is picked up for a movie - would so love to see it on the big screen!
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|I enjoyed the mysterious way of solving the challenge but, the game froze up and I couldn't even shut my Kindle off.  Very frustrating!  I called customer service.  They were extremely helpful.  Since this product is still in development, I think the potential is good.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I thought this book was wonderful.  Was a little unsure about Poetry aspect, because I'm not really much of a poetry lover - but that was such a wonderful part of this book.  I'm also in love now with the Avett brothers and have been enjoying a band, I never would of heard of if it wasn't for this book.  So love Colleen Hoover, her stories are so different and really keep you wanting more.  Can't wait to start the next book of Lake and Will
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was AWESOME. I couldn't put it down.  If you are looking for an action packed, intense novel, buy this AWESOME book.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game...but I'm on the barrel game in USA and can't figure out how to release the pieces.  Arrgh! I've tried working on the side pieces...the hammer...the lightning and the bomb. About ready to give up which is a shame.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Thank you Pharrelle Williams, Niles Rodgers and of coarse Daft Punk, for shining some light on the state of the EDM sene today. It's been too long since I've heard a well produced sound with original flair. This track has enough of both to put a smile on rampaging Rhinoceros face, then have him sit quietly and watch the sun raise.<br /><br />I can't wait until the non-edited version... Never-mind the album release on vinyl.<br /><br />DP4E
B009IA9OLE|2.0|Don't believe the hype. Not what i expected from all the glowing reviews. .99 cents maybe but not $3' you basically click buttons to win cases  .
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Love Star Trek still after all these years. Fun to watch the episodes From long ago. Spock, Capt Kirk, Scottie and Bones
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|Shaun the Sheep is so entertaining and funny. The kids sit in awe when I put it on for them.
0385344333|5.0|Just as exiciting, the only trouble with this book is the problem of getting slepp; it's hard to put down.  With almost non-stop action and more twists and turns than even most other &#34;Reacher&#34; novels, A Wanted Man is a must have for fans of this franchise.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This was the easiest installation I've done in trying to get all my devices Bluetooth friendly.  Works great with my iPod Classic.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I cannot wait till October I'm going nuts watching re-runs.want to know more about the zombies maybe the aliens or government spread the syndrome.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|The lead into this review says it all. This is one app that does what it says it will do. It's great to get a free app that works without having to be a software programmer! Good job.
B009O07NMA|5.0|This was one of the best cd's I've bought in a long time. Love all he songs on it! Saw them in concert and it was great too!
B003VANOFY|3.0|Let me start by saying that I am a little bet of a Logitech fan boy.  I own five products before buying the G930 and was more than happy with all of them. However, I am really disappointed by this headset.  The sound quality, easy of use, range, and setup are perfect, but this device seems to have a number of draw back.  For one there is a popping sound randomly.  I have also run in to a problem with the volume and mic-mute button not responding or switching.  Both of these last problems are easily fixed by restarting the headset and are simple a nuisance.<br /><br />All and all, I honestly feel that this headset could be much better for the money I paid.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|fun, great to watch with my husband and sons - just nice for family movie night. Justin Timberlake is super
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a cute lil game, but it one of those real time deals.  Tapping on every single thing is kinda annoying & not buying credits gets in the way.  I love SIM city type stuff & was greatly disappointed in fantasy town because it kept messing up, no problems here so far.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This was entertaining.<br />The price was good<br />Wasn't hard to solve but did take some thinking.<br />Graphics were good.<br />Thank you.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|After 3 days of  over sleeping I somehow managed to wake up before the alarm.  I waited for it to go off at 7:30 am.  At 7:30 nothing happened.  7:35 nothing.  The alarm finally went off at 7:40 but it said it was 7:30 as if it had been ringing for 10 minutes.  The 8:00 am alarm went off on time with no problem.  For several days I've been waking up seeing it say it had been ringing for a long time and I thought I was going crazy.  Now I  know it's the alarm.<br /><br />I was also never able to set up a song as an alarm as it  was never able to find them in the directory.<br /><br />Lastly, the alarm lacks the ability to set individual volume levels for each alarm.<br /><br />It is easy to set up as long as you remember to hit save after each alarm (don't set this thing while you are half asleep or you may forget to save like I did a couple of times).  It is also very pretty.  If only it worked consistently!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The series itself is wonderful. The actors are amazing and the quality of the photography, music score, etc are excellent. The plot keeps you really hooked. However, we opted for the digital, straight to your tv download, and pretty much every time we watch an episode it freezes for a couple of minutes and then continues. That is a hassle! and I hope Amazon can do something about that.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Well written movie that keeps u locked in!!!  It helps us understand the need for lawyers to represent criminals fairly.
B004W48QFG|1.0|I bought this as an alternative to Splashtop Remote--a free app--and was hoping it would stream video better than Splashtop. I was able to get it configured after downloading and installing a VNC utility for my Windows 8 Home Premium operating system, which does not support an RDP connection. It provided access to my desktop computer, but forget streaming video. It was unwatchable. If all I want is access, I can use Teamviewer,  which is free. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Save your money!
B003WE9TU8|3.0|This novel did not really live up to the hype that I was expecting following other reviews written. It was certainly an interesting writing style but didn't really keep me enthralled.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|I was just thinking that I would get to hear a story about the studio most of my favorite music from the 80s came out of. I didn't realize how important this film was going to be, not just to me, but to anyone who loves music. It gives interesting insight to what the digital movement did to music.
B00887490Y|5.0|To me it was more like a mystery than anything else and I enjoyed it greatly. I can't wait to buy a copy. I watched it because of William B. Davis- aka CGB of the X-files, being a Phile myself, I wanted to watch for him but it was acted well by all. I have seen it three times now. This is the type of movies I like. I want to show my mom who watches all those Columbo shows in her day and can usually figure things out pretty quickly, to see if she'd figure it out! The twists and turns makes me think that she wouldn't which is great. No one likes predictable and this was not.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome game I definitely recommend  buying it. It is one of my favorite games on my kindle.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Could not believe an attractive Seiko at this price!  I am very satisfied with the appearance and performance.  I would recommend it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. It is so easy to use and it keeps a running detail of the numbers you enter. Never saw this on a paperless calculator before.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Great movie, my fiancee didn't even fall asleep during this one. Tense at times, fantastical at others, but those moments make it great.
B00985E3UG|5.0|I went to the grocery store the day I finished this book and spent more time than usual reading labels.  I already make a conscious effort to eat whole foods but crossed a few more things off my list as basically chemical cocktails.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and understand, but there is a bit of dullness at times, however not too preachy, an informational tone overall.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Like Pink's music, she is a great entertainer.  I think alot of her stuff is about issues she has experienced in her life
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great movie! Tells us how we miss so many opportunities until it is too late. Everyone should see this movie with their family and kids. Inspiring movie for all ages. If everyone could live like this there would be less chaos in this world. I recommend this movie for everyone!
B006FE83UE|3.0|I am not a movie buff by any means and purchased this upon recommendation of an associate who was completely enamored by this story. This movie is typical and the same ole story covering the subject of its era. I am not taking away from the fact that this movie is a classic or anything of that sort. I simply was not moved much by it.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Great love story. I would recommend it to everyone that likes a good story. Received it in good quality and very quickly. Was different kind of movie, not your usual happy ending. Was a surprise.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Mis is such a great film! I'm very pleased with my purchase. It's also a big hit with friends and family.
1402760663|5.0|This book was beautiful. It came quickly and in great condition. The pictures and quality was amazing. Made a great gift and I would recommend the book, seller and Indian History to everyone who enjoys the history of our county and forefathers.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|Bought it for my husband. He loves the movie and its hilarious. Not meant for sensitive people though and may offend others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it us really fun and I'm addicted to its a similar game to  temple run but it's still really cool! Surely u should get it to
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This is a well thought out movie chronicling one of the most important pieces of legislation ever passed. The pace of the movie may be slow at times, but I never felt bored watching it. An absolutely great movie, and one that I would consider a 'must watch'.
B008OOYALE|4.0|love this game but it drains my battery really fast<br /> Cool game, Sadly dosnt work with out internet, normally I can go all day with out charging my phone but I have to charge it half way through the day
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I am a big fan of Hungry Shark and I immediently downloaded this. For being free, it sure has a lot of options! I love this game!!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|great movie me and my 20 year old girlfriend enjoyed great family fun.<br />great for kids to id imagine.<br /><br />L
B00633W614|4.0|I am glad you're back with a full length novel. Looking forward to more on this series. Keep going, great.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is one of the best books ever. You will only understand this book if you read the other ones.
B008220BP2|5.0|This movie just leaves you with a great warm feeling..really hope the sequel will be as good...if there is no sequel it's still one to put in your collection...
B0040HO01Y|5.0|A little love , a little romance, and a little comedy.. This show is great, and I hope there will be more series to come..it's just like reading a book , but you can't stop watching it....enjoy
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This was a simple game to get into, but provided plenty of more advanced goals/items to make it more complex and challenging.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a neat game. Love all the different dragons and the egg designs. I'm still learning how to do some things like adding neighbors and sending gifts and visiting others.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Having had a  less than active sex life, this book gave great ideas to try in the future and almost caused great O's while reading.
B000I9YXHY|5.0|Barbie is the best at everything she does of course, this fun ad farcical musical is a real classic and a huge hit.  Mathou was also great in this, he is so dry it is his best humor ever.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|This album has nice sound quality. At least one of the tracks has been previously released, but at least it is a good song.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|Top of the line pshyco drama musical.  Teaches us today well what is going on in our world, not hard to follow and the colors and costumes are great, I would watch this one again!
B009R659L8|3.0|Not one of your best  M's. Higgins.<br />Disappointed. And I agree it. Is a waste of money. Don't bother yourself.
6304806418|5.0|I watch it every week.  Love the characters, all of them.  Simply the best musical ever!  It really makes you love not just Evita but also the actors who portrayed the characters in this true life film.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I love to be able to instantly watch episodes - it comes in handy when you are waiting to get caught up on the season.
B004J64QSI|1.0|BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! BORING! v\BORING! BORING! BORING!  SO boring I found it hard to ge tinto and it seemed to always carry the same theme and scenery, all very drab.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I watched &#34;classic&#34; Dr. Who before this. I think that the first season is very enjoyable considering where it is coming from. The Doctor lost his homeworld and everyone he knows so to speak. If you have prime you should give this a look see. At $1.99 an episode I don't know
B002QRWJA4|5.0|One of my fav movies, a real psycho drama, I bought it too!  Emma ROssum and Gerard Butler kept this movie riviting all the way through!THank you!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This was so amazing and extremely addictive, I love this game playing it all the time, I think it's better than any other game similar to it, like temple run for example. Sometimes tedious but on the whole, a great game to keep you occupied. Loads of fun would recommend to anyone!
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I love Audrey Hepburn, this is her best yet, the costumes were superb and who did not love Rex Harrison' irrascible character in this movie.  He was a rock and really carries his own as do most of the characters in this musical.  It is the best, right up there with Evita!  My Fair Lady is a great Classic!
B0058VW36U|4.0|Hmmm very addictive and extremely irritating when you can't do a level!! But I do love this game one of my favourites!
B00BJS7LHC|1.0|What an unpleasant experience.  After the first 10 minutes, I knew I should eject this thing and put the next two hours to some good use, but, given all the hype surrounding this film, I soldiered on, just wanting to see what all the hoopla was about.  Sigh.  As for Christopher Waltz - who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor - well, I just don't get it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters of the book.  I finished the book within three days.  Would def. tell a friend about this book.
B001MM28JG|5.0|&#34;It's the little things in life&#34; - my favorite quote of the movie.<br /><br />Being a Star Trek fan I get allot of the inside jokes, which are delivered without being harsh.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I found it quite interesting and at times felt I was on the adventure with the author.  I highly recommend it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I thought this movie was a great adventure movie plus one that gave a real message.  I never thought something that seemed so unrealistic - a boy sharing a boat with a tiger - could seem so possible and real.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|Well worth watching. The title is a little confusing, but the acting, plot, and presentation are great. The movie comes from the 1970's but is interesting today. I saw it before but enjoyed watching it again. Thanks for making this available.
B0090SI460|5.0|Bought this unseen on the recommendation of all my other parent-friends...my whole family loves it.  My 5 year-old has taken to quoting it at random.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|NCIS and NCIS: Los Angeles are always great.  I like the mostly unpredictable storylines, as well as the personal drama that goes on with the agents' lives.  Great writing!
0345537998|5.0|i very much enjoyed this book. Great amounts of humor throughout. Mr. Martin's Game of Thrones was my first introduction to this author, and the books are so serious. This book shows he does have a lighter side.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I SO wish I could say I attended this performance. This was the very performance when they raised the cover charge for the Checkerboard Lounge from $2 to $5.<br /><br />I did attend the very next night, a Blue Monday jam, hosted by Lefty Dizz as usual. I walked in just as Lefty and Junior Wells were wailing at the same time. Buddy Guy, Johnny Twist, and Hubert Sumlin also played, deep into the night. Buddy Guy was the owner of the Checkerboard: Lefty Dizz and Junior Wells were partners. All were regular performers.<br /><br />Muddy Waters was at this time playing mainly at larger venues, but as he observes early in this video, this night was very much a homecoming for him. As you can see, the Stones reacted to the Checkerboard in much the way I reacted whenever I went there: with a sense of awe. It was different from the sense of awe one gets in a cathedral, though: this wasn't a holy relic to be revered in a glass case, this was awe mixed with fun, joy, humor, and laughter. You knew this was IT, this was the real thing, this was where the blues are the blues are the blues. Enjoy them, without qualification. As an out-of-town friend observed, \\"If we had this in Ohio, we'd be there every night!\\"<br /><br />Dan Aykroyd thought that the Checkerboard should have been made a national monument. I agree, but it's too late now, it having been demolished years ago, unsurprisingly for safety code violations. There still is Buddy Guy's new place, Legends. And we do still have this video!<br /><br />If I could rely on the company of Lefty Dizz, Junior Wells, Hubert Sumlin, and Muddy Waters in Heaven, and if I could get into Heaven by being good, I'd be good.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Another great Daniel Day Lewis,portrayal!! i have not seen a more versital actor other than Sir Antony Hopkins.<br />CAN NOT WAIT FOR HIS NEXT MOVIE!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Pat is so real and brings you into his life by making you laugh and feel sad at the same time. Best one I've read in a long time.
B00003000M|5.0|This is by far one to keep in your collection, it's well put together and it seems Bob is singing with the other proformers, great mixing a must have...
B00B69UQEO|5.0|This is one of those rare releases where I like every song. DM is one of those bands that just keeps getting better and better, taking electronica to places yet unexplored and then mapping those places with musical precision. Very enjoyable listening. Did anyone else listen to &#34;Always&#34; and think of Trent Reznor? &#34;Always&#34; just seemed to have that Nine Inch Nails undertone to it.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Froze up , couldnt play with it, had to restart many times.  Tried the menu buttons, but that was all froze up!!  Would not waste time to continue.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I love this series.  It is action packed, full of drama and very well done.  Sad that it ever ended as was very entertaining.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It's challenging and morbid, but I don't normally play video games on my phone, and this is the first in a long time that has kept my interest for over a week. Perfect game for dealing with stress, if you're mad at everybody, you can just kill them all off.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Perfect pacing, no dull uninteresting parts. The story is fantastic, ending gave me chills, it's just well thought out and well done, nothing was rushed, it's fantastic. I highly recommend!
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I rented this movie and enjoyed it so much I decided to buy it and play it frequently.  --Would recommend it to all those who enjoy music with developing children.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|This is an absorbing and well-made game with attractive artwork, neat physics, and challenging puzzles with more than one solution. Worth the price. Children will love it. Works on my Nexus 7.
B008602KQI|5.0|Good movie, a little painful to watch emotionally but that's what makes it so good :).  One word, two word three word four word review done.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Excellent...well-written and a surprise at every turn of the page. Although I had part of it figured out before the end, there were still little surprises all throughout.
