B00ECU2RGY|3.0|If you like sci-fi this movie's for you, but don't expect too much. I enjoyed it although it was very predictable.
B0006AAS5G|2.0|I am on my 3rd Invicta Speedway. Over time the prices are going down. Was over $110 few years ago now I see them at $75. The watch looks and feels great BUT, after I replace the battery they stop working this happened twice. My first Speedway had the stainless steel band falling apart after 2 years. So, if you get an Invicta Speedway figure out its good for 2 years at the most. I have other Invicta watches and find they do not last. Before I became familiar with Invicta I used to buy Seiko watches at Sam's Club for $65 (over 10 years ago) All the Seiko watches I have still work and are in excellent condition. If Invicta will work on their quality they might have a wining brand. So far over time I am very disappointed with Invicta. Most 4 & 5 stars reviews are of new customers that just got the watches. You should find reviews of customers with longer history with the watch.
B00E3UN44W|4.0|Lest our joy at the third session Sherlock become uncontrollabe remember the BBC still has  not released the second season of  Manchild after nine years of waiting! They can be so cruel and cold!  Once the UK showing schedule announced one could pop to London at least to see episode one of the third season since they usually the best! Hmmmmmmmmmm!
B007WMI1X2|5.0|The total cost of buying this exact box set from Amazon UK is ~$26, including postage to send it to you in America!  Buy it from the amazon.co.uk web site.<br /><br />BTW, most computers/laptops etc. will allow you to watch DVDs from a different region (such as these \\"Region 2\\" European format DVDs).  Many times the computer will allow you to switch formats a total of 5 times before the format is locked in.  B/c we love to watch British DVDs, I keep my laptop set to British format, and we watch American DVDs on our DVD player or else someone else's computer.  :-)
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This lego set is one must have classic. It's one of the best, my son was busy for two days straight, now it rests on his shelf in his room, and it looks super cool. As with all legos, this is not a toy to play with after it's built, but definitely a must have if you are a star wars fan.
B0084FMBZA|5.0|The feedback on sizing was really helpful in getting the right sandals.  Sandals are true to size and should be ordered as is.  The sandal fits and feels great.  They are durable, good looking and comfortable.  A great gift for yourself.

B00B4Z5J92|5.0|really good music and history of Sound City, especially for rock and roll fans - I def recommend it and want to buy the CD now.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is fun, but be prepared for a high stress level. One thing I do like though, is how it teaches you to be quick and on top of things.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Of the three novels written by the author - this is BY FAR my favorite.  Engrossing, engaging, hard to put down and a great story line.  Everything I love in a book.  My one critique (which is why I didn't rate it 5 stars) - I could've done w/o the descriptiveness of the pig farms.  That felt more like a hidden political agenda of the author than it did fitting in w/ the story itself.  But I nit pic.  Great book, well worth a read.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I wasn't a fan of Justin Timberlake until now. After listening to the first single off the album, Suit & Tie, I was impressed and immediately got addicted to the song. I remember listening to this song on YouTube and I actually had some doubts on this song before listening thinking it would be a pop song. But my doubts were proved wrong after I listened to the song. I only knew Justin as an actor and rarely a singer but I clearly remember him from his song, SexyBack. I had plans to buy the album and after hearing the whole album, I was impressed and became one of the albums I couldn't live without.<br /><br />\\"The 20/20 Experience\\" is Justin Timberlake's first album in seven years after his successful second album, \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\". This album has a completely different sound than his previous albums. I'm glad that Justin brought a new sound to this album since artists today release an album every two years with having the same sound or unbelievably a different sound which is interesting or unsatisfying.<br /><br />1. Pusher Love Girl: I love the beginning of the song and makes an excellent intro to the album. This song is one of those songs I love hearing whenever I'm bored and closing my eyes and imagining the song come to life.<br /><br />2. Suit & Tie: The single that got me addicted to Justin in the first place! The chorus is catchy and I know it by heart. A song I would hear whenever I'm in a happy mood or just relaxing. Also, strangely, whenever someone says \\"suit\\" or \\"tie\\", the song immediately plays in my head along with the music video blocking my vision. Honestly, I love that feeling. I'm glad I have that attachment with the song.<br /><br />3. Don't Hold the Wall: Honestly, I love the song and is easy to imagine. This is one of those songs Justin brought a huge amount of creativity. I'm tempted to listen to the whole song whenever I see it on my MP3 player. Awesome song with a strong blend of creativity.<br /><br />4. Strawberry Bubblegum: This song really generates my imagination. It's a great song with an interesting sound that satisfies me.<br />Also, this song I think is the only one that has two different sounds from the beginning to end. That is what makes the song interesting in my opinion.<br /><br />5. Tunnel Vision: The third single off the album and I was shocked by the sound it brought. This song makes me want to dance and I remember downloading into my MP3 player and immediately fell in love with the song. I listened to this song repeatedly and this doesn't get tiring for me. This song does somewhat bring Justin's former sound while blending in with an addicting sound.<br /><br />6. Spaceship Coupe: I really enjoy listening to this song and is a great song for the lovers. This song has a Prince-influenced sound to it, which is makes it a song you'll listen often or when the feeling of love pleasures your mind.<br /><br />7. That Girl: A song that brings a true R&B sound and somewhat plays in my head. This song is another favorite from the album. This would make a great song to listen to whenever it's night and brings a good feeling.<br /><br />8. Let the Groove Get In: I'm absolutely attached to this song. Personally, this is my favorite song to let loose and dance. I love the Brazilian influence it brings. Justin has again brought creativity to this song from beginning to end. I always find myself listening to this song almost everyday. I love when Justin performs this song and suddenly makes me dance and sing along. Justin has again made a song that a fan can't stop listening to.<br /><br />9. Mirrors: Justin brings back his former sound into this song with a new style. It's basically introducing the old/new Justin Timberlake. Everybody knows this song as a love song, however, even though it portrays love, this song also introduces self-confidence in one of the verses. I love listening to this song on the radio or on my MP3 player. I again have an attachment with this song since I keep singingthe chorus over and over. Another song that not only brings love but a little bit of self-confidence.<br /><br />10. Blue Ocean Floor: A soothing and mellow ending to the album. When Justin sings this song, it seems like he's calming me down whenever I'm in a bad mood or relaxing me with his voice. I remember eating chocolate and listening to this song at the same time. I enjoyed that feeling and I love when at the end of the song, it features a sound where the music is sinking into the water. This is a song I can imagine and should have a music video. But while listening to this song, I picture a music video going along with the song. Awesome song with calming verses and a great ending to the album.<br /><br />Justin has said in an interview that the background behind the album's title is hearing the songs and also creating a vision for each one. He kept his word and I have to say that this is one of the best albums I've listened to. I'm proud that Justin matured his sound and hasn't been influenced by the horrible music out there today. Justin is a musical genius and I'm happy he's back in the music industry. Although some fans may not be satisfied with this album, they should know that Justin hasn't been influenced by the crappy and bland music people hear everyday. I can't wait for the second half of the album to arrive in September. I'm expecting not only to have a similar sound on this album, but sounds that reminds fans of \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\" and \\"Justified\\". Thank you Justin and Timbaland for making this album into one of the best albums of the year. Both of you are musical geniuses. Keep bringing music that'll have fans listening over and over.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|The app makes searching so much harder than it needs to be, first you cant search for a standalone video and you cant go on to channels so its very hard to see your fav youtuber`s new videos, also when a video is loading you cant go to suggested vids or comments or change ANYTHING about the video while its loading, and the default setting for EVERY video is 720p, the kindle isnt made for that unless your talking ,about the HD one. Just dont get the app, and get as far away from it as possible.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I found the book fascinating and learned a great deal of history I didn't know previously. My only criticism is that the book ended rather abrubtly. I would have appreciated knowing more about who the author thinks Jesus really was (is).
B000OXHRRC|3.0|Cute movie, but not much substance.  Nice photography and some humorous spots but all things considered I would have been better off investing the time elsewhere.
1567184855|5.0|Easy reading and a good writer.  The writer has a way with words that conveys to the reader what he wants understood. I would like to order other books this person has written.
B0080CKGZE|2.0|The quality of cast, costumes, and scenery failed to overcome a woefully inadequate script.  Disappointing view.  Many better options for this genre:  The Way We Live Now, Mayor of Casterbridge, etc.l
B00CEK9OTM|3.0|The actual game is a very well done maze where you have to find your way out as well as find at least one of the three often hidden stars. That's the part of the game that I like. What I dislike is the unnecessary difficulty in keeping the sphere in place. For example on level 36 (which I'm stuck on), it is extremely difficult to move the sphere onto the rising platform and keep it there until it can be transferred onto a moving platform.  These platforms seem to have one or more invisible peaks, causing the sphere to roll off at the slightest movement. This becomes rather frustrating and stops being fun. For that reason, I am subtracting 1 1/2 stars, plus a 1/2 star for the very unattractive graphics.  Really a shame as this game has the potential to be a winner.
140006922X|1.0|Nothing new here. Even his attempt to cast Jesus as a Zealot is tortured.<br />Sorry for him that he abandoned the Jesus of his youth for the Jesus of so-called &#34;scholars&#34; who have mired him in very old mud. Bless him, Lord, and forgive him.
1465408746|5.0|As most DK books the illustrations in this one are first rate.<br />The commentary/analysis that goes along with it about the &#34;history&#34;<br />(real movie and Star Wars universe) of each machine is a blast.<br />I have always loved cut away drawings and this book is a treasure trove<br />of them. And did I mention it's about Star Wars!!!

B003G4W49C|4.0|Read this book because my nephew's name is ender. Also because of the movie trailers. Having been written before most of today's technology the author was quite perceptive on tablet use and internet capabilities. Now if someone could just help us travel to the stars.

B00AQSYEA8|5.0|GRAND HOTEL is a screen adaptation of a stageplay based on Vicki Baum's 1929 novel, \\"Menschen im Hotel.\\"  As is mentioned, there's a \\"Grand Hotel\\" in every major European city.<br /><br />The story opens and closes with an on-call physician's blas&eacute; comment about the boring state of affairs at Grand Hotel. We soon learn how wrong his assessment is, for several lives briefly and serendipitously intertwine at the famous Berlin hostel. No one would leave GH totally unchanged by their experiences.<br /><br />A top-shelf MGM cast make this Best Picture Oscar-winner always interesting. It's a must-see for all classic era film lovers if only to hear Garbo's legendary line, \\"I vant to be alone!\\"<br /><br />Also recommended:<br />Another star-filled MGM ensemble appears in George Cukor's [[ASIN:B0006Z2KXO DINNER AT EIGHT]] (1933).<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.6) Grand Hotel (1932) - Greta Garbo/John Barrymore/Joan Crawford/Wallace Beery/Lionel Barrymore/Lewis Stone/Jean Hersholt/Tully Marshall
B001NLKZUA|4.0|The book was great, although I'm quite frustrated with Clary's love life at the moment. Definitely buying the next one in the series.
B000001GBJ|5.0|Romantic, poignant, soothing - classical-new age.  Violin/string, harp, mandolin/lute (?), flute.  What more can you ask for?<br />I swear one of the tunes was in a movie, but can't place it.
0312588887|5.0|This is on my list of five books I would read once a year.  The story is great, the characters well defined.  But one of the best reasons to read and re-read this book is that the life lessons Emma learns and teaches her grandchildren.  I wish Emma had been my grandmother.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|We use it in our home studio to hook up an interface to our new iMac - it has worked flawlessly so far. With that said for $30 it was needed and it works... not much else to ask for.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched this as soon as I received it. I can't wait to get season 4. Very very good service as well.

1451648537|5.0|Yes, it's a book about Steve Jobs' life, but it's also the complete history of Apple, and--in a broader sense--the history of the Silicon Valley. Plus, you have in your hand a detailed manual on how to be a business executive, how to design and market products, how to motivate employees, and how to negotiate deals. Wow!<br /><br />For the rest of my review, please visit BlogTalkRadio.com and search for Paul Piper (my radio pen name). Click on the review dated August 21, 2013. Thank you.

B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been playing non stop since I got Magic 2014. I do wish you could continue winning booster packs are the first three, or at least allow use of all the M14 cards in the deck builder. It would be nice to be able to combine cards from all the decks to make your own and not be so forced into a particular play style.  Overall still loving it!
B007AL48UK|1.0|I've already tried to play a few different boards and on each one there seems to be at least one tile that is available to play, but for some reason the game won't let me play that particular tile. Even when that tile and its pair is the only playable move and the hint shows I can play that tile the game won't let it be played. That makes the entire game useless. Uninstalling.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|OK. Let's tackle the elephant in the room:  This is not the kind of music John is known for.  Ok.<br /><br />I'm tired of reading things like: This is \\"different\\" music than what John should be doing;  John is supposed to be doing blues; Continuum is so much better; He's a hipster.  Blah Blah Blah.<br /><br />Yes, it's obvious John has taken a different approach to his music in his later years. However, let's be grown-ups and rate the music for music, not for what he used to play before.  If you don't like this album (like a HUGE percentage of his fan base), then that is fine.  However, different doesn't equal worse. Different is different; we should appreciate all kind's of music.<br /><br />To be clear, I prefer John's Continuum or TRY phase A LOT more than this.  Regardless, here is my review.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />Music Production: 5/5<br />-John seems to be improving in his production of albums.  He is able to reach a perfect level of warmth in his music, without going overboard and sounding too overproduced like a lot of artist do today.<br /><br />Lyrics: 4/5<br />-John has proven to be one of the best (if not the best) songwriters of his generation.  Paradise Valley picks off where he left off with Born and Raised and continues to write wonderful lyrics. I found B&R to be his absolute best songwriting.  While this is not up there with B&R (and some of his older music), most of the songs on this album are written wonderfully.<br /><br />Musical Arrangements/Style: 4/5<br />-This is a tricky subject.  While some would argue this album is very monotonous, I believe it is really good for the style he is going for.  Again, while I prefer some of his masterful arrangements (like Something's Missing or Clarity), I think these arrangements are beautiful.<br /><br />Musical Performance: 5/5<br /> Many people will argue John is being lazy with his guitar playing, but I would argue the contrary.  I think John understands he is more of a blues player.  For this reason, other guitarist and musicians who are better acquainted with this style of music are brought in to perform many guitar parts.  Any more solos, or even bigger solos, would not go well with this style of music.  John understands this and finds the perfect balance.  Silence speaks more than notes.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-While I love Frank Ocean, I thought his role in this album was very out of place.  I did not enjoy his contributions.<br />-There wasn't one outstanding song in this album.  I would argue Badge and Gun, or I Will Be Found were the best songs.  However, there wasn't that one incredible song like all of his other albums have had.<br /><br />Overall: 4.5/5<br /><br />I respect John for moving away from his blues comfort zone and trying new music he enjoys, regardless if a lot of fans won't like it.<br /><br />This album is a great example of \\"Less equals more\\".<br /><br />There are other things in music than long, difficult solos.<br /><br />Enjoy this album for what it is: A heartfelt album by a wonderful musician.

B000002L5P|5.0|My favorite album of all time and my favorite band of all time. When people ask me what my favorite album by The Smiths is, or how would I describe their sound, I tell them to listen to this album. This album IS The Smiths to me and pops into my head whenever I hear people talking about them. \\"This Charming Man\\", \\"Still Ill\\", \\"Pretty Girls Make Graves\\", \\"Hand In Glove\\", and pretty much the rest are some of my favorite songs all in one record. Such amazing sound, lyrics, and emotion in these songs that The Smiths have changed my life completely. I can remember listening to a few tracks of theirs to give them a shot to see if I'd like them, and I didn't really care for them at first. Then I went back to hear them again and I don't know what changed , but I instantly became hooked, and the songs spoke to me. I knew I had overlooked greatness for the last time. So if you don't like them the first time around, give them another shot and take a closer listen. This band rekindled my love for music. If you're curious on what album to start off with by The Smiths, it's this one.
B008Y76VW2|4.0|enjoyable movie.  interesting characters, and a decent story that holds your interest. Also backed up with a neat soundtrack.<br />not a bad way to spend an afternoo.
B000002L7J|4.0|I love all of The Smiths' songs and albums. Some more than others, yes, and this one I guess would be my least favorite of their four studio albums. Although it is a love/hate sort of thing because it contains my favorite track by The Smiths, \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" So that makes up for this record and also \\"Meat Is Murder\\" of course. Nonetheless it is really good for any The Smiths fans, although I would recommend listening to their first album \\"The Smiths\\"(Favorite) or  \\"The Queen Is Dead\\" if you're just getting into this iconic band.
1608871819|5.0|Man of Steel: Inside the Legendary World of Superman is a good making of book on the film. This book goes into detail of how Man of Steel was made and has lots of concept artwork , and behind the scenes information and photos from the making of Man of Steel. If your a fan of Superman and of making of movie books in general this book is a good read for you.

B00ANAC32U|4.0|When you see people's phones, most of them have a bulky and unpleasant looking case on it to protect it. This is not the case. This bumper protects your phone and lets you continue to display it's aesthetics.  The Nexus 4 is a fantastic looking device, but it is easy to damage the device (even without dropping it). This bumper does not sacrifice your device looks and protects your phone.<br /><br />First, these is the perfect bumper. The thing that makes this different from other cases is that it is made for the Nexus 4. When you put it one, it appears as if it is a part of the device (and still removable). It is rubber with a metallic look around it like the Nexus 4 does. The bumper has kind of like 'replacement buttons that operates as buttons for the device. If you thought the phone looks good, the bumper makes it look even more cooler.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this for ALL Nexus 4 owners that want to continue to display the design of their phone and protect it. I have not drop it still, but this bumper should not excuse you from dropping your phone (unless you want to take the risk). Personally, I do not feel as if it will fully protect my phone. If you are clumsy and drop your phone frequently, I would think twice about this and consider something more 'cautious'.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|It's a cute book, and an interesting concept - a drunken wedding in Vegas. The next morning the groom doesn't want to break up because he actually likes the idea of a convenience marriage. She's not so sure but she decides to give it a try. After all, the guy is hot and rich and wants what she wants, children without all the drama of a marriage based on emotion.<br /><br />But these characters are really nuts. Megan is gorgeous, and supposed to be intelligent and independent. Yet she comes across as whiny and very insecure. Connor is a bratty, demanding control freak. He forced her into the relationship and when she wanted to get away he refused to let her go. He didn't care what she wanted, only what he wanted. He had to have his way. I'd be scared if I were Megan.<br /><br />But Megan falls in love with Connor and I can't figure out why. Yes, they can talk about anything and he's quite romantic, until he isn't. Their relationship is based only on sex, which was apparently pretty good.<br /><br />WARNING: This book is a little smutty.<br /><br />It did have some good parts, funny one-liners, and some quirky support characters. The writing style was good, easy to read and kept my interest. Just those main characters...

030758836X|5.0|This book took me a while to get into.  I felt it was written quite strangely until the time frames became important.  Unfortunately, after finishing the book, I had to sit and think about the characters and their morals.  I brought the book to read at the eye Dr and she noticed I was reading it.  She said she already had and found the characters to be horrible people.  The following day I went to my orthopedist and his nurse said she thought it was a fabulous book.  I thought it was well written, and hopefully, imaginative on the part of the author.  Would I read her again?  Yes.  I was intrigued.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|Absolutely awesome product. Could really change the game for the touch screen experience. Works just as it claims following the application instructions. Very easy to use and seems to last a long time with just one application. A truly great buy for the price. I want to buy more and send it to my friends and family!!! So cool.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love this movie, the DVD set is awesome, great acting and awesome story! Definitely a family favorite in our household.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|The movie had a lot of action, mostly the usual stuff.  Guns that never run out of ammo.  Props that just happen to be there<br />when you need them.  Perfectly controlled plane crash.  Junk like that.  Thank goodness for fast forwarding.<br /><br />The editing in spots was poor.  One minute Stallone has a mustache, and the next he doesn't, and then he does again all while he's still doing the same scene.<br /><br />It was ok once, but I wouldn't bother with it again.
B005XUC398|5.0|The film encapsulates the entire &#34;financial meltdown&#34; and the subsequent opportunity for more riches for the same folks who caused it in a terse 24 hour drama.
B007KGXY0K|5.0|This board rocks, I highly recommend it. I built a workstation for HPC using this board:<br />2x E5-2690<br />2x EVGA nVidia Titan<br />2x 32GB 64GB Corsair Vengeance CMZ32GX3M4X1866C10 1866Mhz but clocked at 1600Mhz (maximal official supported speed)<br />2x Cooler Master 412S<br />1x Kingston 480gb hyperx 3k SSD<br /><br />I currently use Ubuntu and it really works flawlessly. I just bumped into some minor annoyances e.g. if you try to force the RAM speeds higher than 1600Mhz it may not post anymore, so you need to clear the CMOS and to do that you need to move a jumper that is hidden well below the graphic cards ... not very practical. For this price tag they could have simply thrown in a CMOS reset button like the RIVE has.<br /><br />All in all, I am really happy with the functionality and performance. The BIOS comes with tons of settings and seems possible to overclock, though I haven't done so except changing the RAM speed.<br /><br />If you'd like to see some HPC benchmarks, this is a project I have been developing with it:<br />[...]<br /><br />UPDATE: The following is a performance guide for this motherboard which I try to keep up to date (updates, suggestions welcome!):<br />[...]
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It was a pleasure reading the book and taking the experiments to confirm what all we knew and lost in the way.
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|A better Cast than the first one, especially with the Rock at the helm. Good action scenes but should have been sustaining throughout the film - after all, this is G I JOE. Definitely worth watching.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Been a Doctor Who fan since the late 70s starting with Tom Baker. They keep getting better every season, with this one probably being the best so far.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Nothing extremely special about the film but it was an &#34;okay&#34; story with a solid performance from Matthew McConaughey. Definitely worth watching
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|This is kind of fun,never like Suduko before, but this is actually fun. I guess my opinion of the game changed as I got older. Great you have different themes.
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|Call me a simple minded guy without a &#34;Ivy League&#34; education but this film went over my head. I simply didn't get the story. The only thing that kept me watching was the cinematography and CGI/A - Morgan Freeman was a draw but his time and talents were wasted on this film. Tom Cruise is boring and typical - every role he plays is the same. Don't pay for this movie in any way - wait for it to come on cable.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Product works great!  Service was excellent: I purchased this item for a Ultrabook, which does not have a CD drive for loading the product's driver software. Contacted their support shop and they responded within one day with a URL so that I could download drivers.  I recommend them.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Loved the way it showed all the bands and they way they rebuilt the studio and making new recordings today
B0063IH60K|1.0|Cards are not randomly shuffled between games.  The play or draw of cards follow a pattern that after palying for a while you can predict what card is coming next.  After the first 4 cards I can tell you the complete outcome of the game.  Certain cards always follow certain other cards etc.  The ads are a pain too but you have to pay for the game somehow even if the games a flop.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  It's nice to have a good series that's not full of violence, sex or swearing.  Way to go!
0679805273|5.0|Saw the idea on Pinterest to have all my childrens teachers through the years, sign this book and write a little something about the memories they have of their students... so I have been keeping up with them as they go through the years.  Cute keepsake.
B00E88YNJY|5.0|Buy it...buy it buy it! A wonderful blend of sassy folk, meets heartfelt bluegrass, meets soulful throw back voice!  I read a London review that said Holliday meets Parton voice and that's about as dead on with a description as you can get...Her voice is awesome!
B000AM2L1O|4.0|This doll smells good (vanilla) even 2 years after we bought it!  My 4 year old STILL loves this doll.  Just bought a similar one for my 2 year old... because they fight over the older daughter's doll.  The accessories you can buy are so cute.  The body is made of fabric which has pilled up over the 2 years she has played with it, though.  Also, some of the clothes have also pilled.  Dont know why  they cant just use cotton to make the clothing.  I recommend this doll.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I am very curious how the story is going to end. If you like &#34;Hunger Games&#34; and &#34;Divergent&#34;, you will enjoy it!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I downloaded this game as the free app of the day. Once I started playing I couldn't stop! I was only disappointed when I ran out of levels.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love playing this game and you get to play with others friends you know and friends that just love to play that you don't know
B004L35GAQ|3.0|It's alright .... It's decent ... I do not hate it ... But I do not love it either. The end. @BeGam_
B003G4W49C|5.0|I don't know how I hadn't read this earlier in my life.  It's a good story and very easy to read.  That said, be aware that it uses language that is frowned upon in today's society.  It is interesting to see something as intricate in character detail as racism show up in a sci-fi novel though.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is so good! I love everything about this book! I love the characters and the plot of the book! Can't wait until the movie comes out! I hope E L James writes more book like this one. Maybe a 4th book who knows!
1908435585|4.0|Have just finished the first book and enjoyed it. It may not be as good as the Hunger Games or Insurgent series but kept me reading.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is the best assembly of jazz musicians of modern jazz. And the SONY recording is icing on the cake. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!
0385742886|3.0|I read this before the three Maze Runner books. I didn't like it as much as the first book. Maybe I should have read it last? I am just finishing the 1st book of the trilogy and liked that one more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game loved it and I wanted more so I guess that was disappointing. So I want more levels please.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|First book I read on my new kindle. I picked it up as it was only a few buck. It was surprisingly good!
140131046X|5.0|Inspirations all the way. Better outlook on life and encouragement a for anyone to ponder and live by.<br />Awesome! Awesome!
0321146530|5.0|TDD explained by the master.  Examples in Java which didn't matter to much to me, I work in C# and Javascript and was able to relate.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I love magic the gathering and this is a very good game on steam and on PS3/Xbox360 but, there is a horrible bug on this game. It will bug out and take all of the storage. This was the first thing I got so I had all of the storage free but this game glitched out.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|good game fun for a family and to play with real people also good to meet other while you play with them.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app turns my phone into a Kindle when I choose to. If you own and Android phone, you have this app allows you to access all the books available to Kindle users.
B00915G6MG|4.0|Great season, and a really good finale! I seriously hope the rumors about Ziva leaving the show aren't true. I don't know if the show will ever be the same without her on it. But I don't care, I love NCIS :)
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I liked the book in the beginning, but found my mind drifting once the historical aspect dragged on for too long.  The characters are well played out and interesting but at some point they all became predictable.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Get this app. then get the tunein radio free app. Plug in a decent set of ear buds turn up the volume close your eyes and you will swear you are listening to a $2000 stereo system. Absolutely Amazing! Also looks great on the screen. Tested and reviewed on my KFHD7.
0696019973|5.0|I love this book. It has some very nice quilting patterns. The blocks are small with very small pieces, but I enlarged them for my use.
B008K8U13K|5.0|I have  this game and its the best. 1problem. I can't BEAT ACT 3 OF<br />MAD GEAR ZONE. But buy it
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Install was easy and fast. i was able to hook it up within 10 min. of product registration. It's great if you want to stream YouTube videos or Netflix, but other than that its pretty limited. The Chrome browser streaming capability is terrible. -- don't bother with it -- at least not right now.<br /><br />Though I do see this being a powerful device once they bring on more content providers on their platform.<br /><br />I'll update my review when that happens.
1480054542|4.0|I loved this book and immediately bought the next 3 in the series. great characters. great story. i love when each character gets their own book in a series. you will enjoy this book and i assure you , you will want to get the others as well. happy reading !
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book really helped me to understand Steve Jobs. In some areas my admiration grew, in others it diminished. I highly recommend reading this book for no other reason than to ultimately reflect on what it is you are passionate about. One wish is that he had spent more time on what changed Mr. Jobs in his years &#34;in the wilderness.&#34; The book just briefly touches in it and clearly something taught him to be a better leader.
B007REV4YI|5.0|brings it back to the greatness that was casino royal. just try to forget about the last one, and good to see some things come back around
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|I heard so much about how great this movie was, but I didn't really like it.  It made me kind of sad.  I expected uplifting or funny, but not sad.  I guess I had totally wrong expectations of what this film was going to be.  The actors are great.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|I got this movie for my boys (12 and 7 years of age) I remember watching it in high school and loved it. Wanted them to watch it.<br />12 year old loved it the 7 year old said it was &#34;eh&#34;
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I loved this movie.  I wouldn't let children watch it, but for adults it is fantastic.  I didn't know what to expect since it was a Quentin Tarentino film, but I loved it.  I don't want to say much about it because it's great not knowing much about it so you'll be pleasantly surprised when you watch it.  It does have some graphic, violent scenes, but I expected that with Quentin Tarentino.
0307914550|4.0|Very good book. I enjoyed it very much couldn't put it down.<br />I wish it gave more info on their running style.
B007Z9QY1S|2.0|I loved the present-day romance that took place in this film alongside flashbacks to Wallis Simpson and the Duke of Windsor's romance.  The past scenes were shot beautifully.  I think it is worth watching just for the period filming.  I just didn't think there was much substance to the movie in general.  It seemed more like a fashion show than a movie.
B00DQBWLSO|1.0|I'm a big John Mayer fan , really like his first few albums...strong song writing & playing. This newest album lacks the writing- creativity & fire found earlier. Very let down with this collection of tunes....seems he has lost the magic in his writing as so many artists do. I'll pass on this CD & hope the next one gets back on track.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|The sets and actors were all perfect, but I think the movie got mired in too much dialogue.  I found myself not paying attention to what was being said.  I loved the actors, the sets were amazing, but I felt like the script could have been more concise and understandable.
0316236535|4.0|My son loves this book since he was very little. It gets him remember eyes, nose, hair, face, ears and etc, so educational as well.
B0097HC8MK|5.0|Nicolas was awesome as usual.  Elizabeth wasn't bad either.  Interesting to see how two lonely people try to console each other.  We are not meant to be alone.  Sad story, but I'm it's happening all around us.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Best game ever first experience and no complaints , it always give you free tokens to be able to play . I recommend this game , perfect for a quick wait or just to spare some free time .
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|I love Duncan's sense of humor and his style of writing. In fact I found this book because of his other work listed on Goodreads as well as his satiric pieces he's written on sites like TheSpoof dotcom. If you like sarcasm, often sardonic, humor with a familiar tone, Duncan is an author to read. In a time when we look at ourselves and the world around us with a critical eye, it is nice to be able to sit down with a book that asks us to take a more light-hearted approach. Actor's Life is a great way to introduce yourself to this writer and some of his longer work.<br />Enjoyable reading!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Awesome game with lots of different ways to play.  The free tournament keeps me coming back every day.  I love the Plano feature too.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Even if you don't care for the intricate plot of this movie's intriguing story, it's a must-see as far as special effects are involved, especially if you're an animal lover.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I really hope more people start giving this show a change. The scrips is so well written, and incredibly witty. This show is lighthearted, yet I almost die with laughter during every episode.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Maybe my lack of love is because I don't truly understand poetry; it doesn't seem to move me the way it can others. But I think Colleen Hoover is a great writer, whose specialty is well developed characters.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|As always difficult to develop a screenplay from a book.  While there were short cuts due to time constraints there is some intelligence to the script.  Opening scene may be a bit difficult and off putting for some viewers.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|Just wondering..if I buy this for a friend who onlyhas a DVD player, will this work?<br />I hear this movie is amazing and want to buy it for my friend.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|which followed Night Of The Living Dead and El Topo.  A whole generation grew up watching this over and over......There's a good reason.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Buddy Guy sounds great, as usual. The guest tracks are some of the weakest, especially the Keith Urban number, but even those are pretty good. Amazing stuff for a man in his late 70s.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is my first time playing this game and I am enjoying it very much. I would recommend fit to anyone wanting to keep their brain alert.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first Colleen Hoover book I'd read, and I think she's very talented.  The characters were so well developed; I became very attached to Sky & Holder.  The subject matter was quite serious at times, but it was well handled.  I would definitely recommend!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Like many others, I have been playing this game for nearly a year.  It just goes on and on.  It's not the best hidden picture game I have played, but it is reasonably entertaining.  The progress can be slow at times, particularly. if you must go for a while with no Internet connection, but it does at least make it last.  I go through other hidden picture games within an hour or two, usually.  I do enjoy speculating about the manor and why we're all there.  Personally, I think it's the afterlife.  In any case, the other occupants of the manor are quirky enough to be amusing, as is the game's particular brand of English.  I don't mind very occasionally dropping a couple of bucks on the game, especially since it was free.  I think maybe I've spent $4 in the last year.  Mostly I just work at it until I get what I need through game play.  It adds to the challenge.  I like that when a friend drops out of the game I can go right away and replace them from a pool of current players.  Thus far I have not had to send game requests to anyone I know.  I do wish there was a little more of a plot and maybe changing objects, but it's still fun.
193700788X|5.0|I thought this book was the perfect bow on the gift Charlene gave us of the superb Sookie series.  I'm a bookaholic and I commonly read several books on different topics at the same time. The exceptions to that habit have been the Sookie series and Lee Child's Jack Reacher series. Those I read cover to cover like a guilty pleasure. I have never reviewed a book before because so many of the reviews I've read were so biased that I pretty much steered clear oF them. The poor reviews of this book changed my mind and I hope more of Ms Harris's fans will say their pieces. What appears in these reviewss affect whether a person buys the book or not. What a wonderful and funny read i would have missed if i'd have not bought this last volume. Not only was this book well written, it took me on an adventure. In the end, it put every character in an appropriate place. For my money, this series is so much better than the Harry Potter series that it i'snt even close. I have not yet read any of Ms Harris's other series yet, but I think I'll start with Lilly Bard. I am going to miss Sookie and friends a lot, but I hope Charlene has much more reading pleasure in store for us. In closing I would like to ask revierers to be thoughtful, fair and on topic. We should all just give our fair and honest opinion of the book  Again, THANK YOU, CHARLENE.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|Heard it all before.  Buble is becoming boring.  Song choice: predictable and tired.  As a matter of fact, I felt as though I had literally heard these songs before.  Nothing new or exciting here.  The arrangements bland and far too familiar.  Come on, Michael, do something fresh.
B008M721MS|3.0|can not play pogo on this app.  Family wants together on skype to play cards by skype will not allow it using the kindle.
1594487154|5.0|Selling when done with grace and service in mind is as noble a profession as any other.<br /><br />This book is a paean to the Willy Noman in all of us: Joe Everyman trying to make a living by persuading others to part with their time or materiel or both.<br /><br />Highly recommended for startups, in my opinion, because it helps you quickly identify who your core customers are likely to be. It's not forumulaic but rather driven by first principles. You will need time and conscientious effort to learn the principles, see them in action and over time, internalize the lessons. This will also allow you to qualify prospects sooner, find better positioning statements, and so forth, all while having fun and performing an important service for your customers, company and yourself.
B00CRW2066|5.0|Disclaimer - I love The National, so am pre-disposed to love this album....but how could you not?  Beautiful and instantly likeable - turning quickly into love.  Never tiring and multi-layered.  I could go on and on.  If you are thinking of buying - stop thinking and just do it.  You will find yourself listening to it over and over and finding something new each time.  This band just keeps getting better - thanks guys!
0763660531|5.0|My 3-year old son has requested to read this book at least every single day since we got it about two weeks ago! And he's not one to let go easily of old favorites.<br /><br />We love 'reading' this beautifully rendered book together. The story itself is magical and the drawings are breathtaking but what I love most is that I can see the book growing with my children (3 & 1 years old). What I mean with that is that the story is easy to understand for a 3-year old and progresses clearly with each page. But there are also so many wonderful details we'll continue to discover together on the richly illustrated pages as he gets older. And there are layers of meaning to this story that are over the head of my 3-year old but that I can imagine exploring with my kids when they are a few years old.<br /><br />Here's the last and--to me--very important feature of this book: we are a bilingual family and both my husband and I can read this story with our kids! My son memorizes his favorite stories and books with words therefore work only in one language. But with Journey it's different and I am so excited that we both can enjoy reading his favorite book with him.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|thanks to the creators of the app it is addicting.it is such a super fun game. thanks again to evetybody
B00E8B1358|4.0|Enjoyed it but not as much as the previous offerings on this series.  Plenty of special effects and explosions.  The ninja fight on the side of the mountain was incredibly captivating.  I would see it again just to watch that fight sequence one more time.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great show! Ryan Murphy has done it again. I loved Nip/Tuck and love Glee, AHS is a story that has you asking questions, makes you thinks, wanting to know what happens on next weeks episode. The characters are awesome and actors who play them were fabulous. You start caring for the character and their story. I can't wait to watch AHS: Asylum and Coven.
1616550414|5.0|I got this for my husband as a wedding present, he loves it. Was pleasantly surprised when it arrived how dense the book really is. I am a huge fan of all the color and illustrations.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|It is a bit hard to follow at first, but otherwise it was an entertaining and good movie.  Will recommend to my friends...
B0063GORYU|4.0|I can sit for hours and just play the only thing I think about is beating my time . I play many different kind of solitary games and this is a favorite.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This was one of my favorite apps. They took a nice simple app and ruined it. Like I don't get enough ads and spam anyway,  now when I check the weather I get even MORE! Put it back the way it was!
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|A pretty good movie.  My wife and I really enjoyed it.  Plenty of special effects, explosions and incredible complex situations for Bruce to solve.  Definitely a must watch.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Ive been having issues with space. and I deleted all my apps. so when I went to look it up on amazon forums. they said this app would help. IT DID. it cleared 10 GB already and a Butt load of ram and battery
0307719774|5.0|First thing I do when I get in bed at night.  Love the different questions and look forward to seeing how my answers change or stay the same over time.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I had no idea it was going to be such a great movie... Please see it, you won't regret it...
B008JFUPFI|4.0|My first reaction to \\"Man of Steel\\" when I heard about it being made was .... Zack Snyder... Who the heck is Zack Snyder. Then I thought, OMG, Not that guy who made The Watchmen and (gulp) Suckerpunch. 2 of the worst comic book movies in my opinion. Only Daredevil and the Ang Lee Hulk film are worse. Then I realized, well... he did also make 300. Now that was a good movie. So even though I was concerned that a director who had 3 of the biggest stinkers I ever watched (lets not forget Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole)to his credit, I figured Nolan would be the one to set the tone. Nolans story was well fleshed out. Yes, we have seen all of this before but it is necessary to do an origins story when trying to reboot a franchise. Batman Begins was excellent and I hoped Man of Steel would be equally so. I wasn't disappointed. Between Nolan's story and Snyders action sequences, it was a very good escape. That is not to say it was perfect or it didn't have its flaws. It did. My biggest gripe was the final battle between Superman and Zod. It was certainly action packed but I felt like the director was simply trying to \\"one up\\" the Avengers. The destruction of Metropolis was too extreme. Every other building was falling down and in the end, it looked like a nuclear bomb went off. I know that was the point, after all, you had 2 indestructible god like beings battling it out, but again, I just thought it was too much. When Superman finally won that battle, by breaking his biggest rule, I genuinely felt for Superman. I could feel his anguish, and I give credit to Henry Cavill. I was very concerned when I heard he was going to play Superman but when I saw him in the suit, I thought to myself, He IS Superman. The rest of the cast was absolutely perfect. Kevin Costner was totally believable and Russell Crowe was a perfect Jor El. The wonam who played Lara (Supermans biological mother) was heartbreaking as was Diane Lane as Martha Kent. Even Zod's second in command was wonderfully cast. Amy Adams was absolutely beautiful and perfect for Lois Lane. That leaves me with my second gripe. Zod....Michael Shannon, Umm, No. He is a good actor but I did not feel him as Zod for even a second. But then, After Terence Stamp, no one really has a prayer of pulling off Zod. When Stamp so arrogantly commanded \\"Kneel before Zod\\", yeah, you know what I'm saying. Shannon was a suitable villian, but he just didnt \\"feel\\" like Zod to me. My third biggest gripe, and its a whopper..... Not once did we hear the signature Superman theme. Yes, I know it was a reboot and they wanted to get as far away from the earlier movies as possible, but Superman, above ALL OTHER super heroes, is identified by his theme music from the original Superman movie. I usually like Hans Zimmers musical scores, but this one was so lacking. Part of it actually sounded like a previous score he did and to me, that is blasphemy. John Williams would never rehash his music for different movies. The decision to avoid the Superman theme music was wrong. They didnt have to use it in its original form, they could have modified it, but they chose to avoid it altogether, and the movie suffers for that.<br /><br />So, in closing, I'm not usually this verbose with my reviews, but Man of Steel deserved it. My barometer for the quality of a movie is simple. I ask one question. That question is \\"Did I enjoy it?\\" and the answer is a resounding \\"YES\\"
B001NHNG64|3.0|I've been reading the Jack Reacher novels in order and after Lee Child's debut with &#34;Killing Floor&#34; I honestly had high expectations for &#34;Die Trying.&#34; The book wasn't that bad, I just wasn't that impressed with the motive. Nonetheless, the writing was superb and it was as descriptive as ever. What truly pulls me in with Lee Child novels is the fact that I envision the action unfolding in my mind as though I'm watching a movie. It's the key reason why I will continue to read the Jack Reacher series despite a few disappointments here and there.
031623480X|5.0|When I saw this title, I knew I had to read it. \\"Grain Brain\\" brought images of a cow at a computer. Since I am very interested in both the mind and good health, I wanted to learn more. Like so many people, I want to do anything I can to avoid dementia and Alzheimer's.<br /><br />So, who is Dr. Perlmutter and why should we listen to him? It turns out that he is one of the leading integrative medicine neurologists in North America today. He is the author of [[ASIN:1594480931 The Better Brain Book: The Best Tool for Improving Memory and Sharpness and Preventing Aging of the Brain]] and [[ASIN:1401928188 Power Up Your Brain]]. Like Dr. Oz and Dr. Andrew Weil, he integrates conventional medicine diagnosis and treatment with the latest innovations in nutritional and environmental medicine. I love medical doctors who have traditional training and look for prevention rather than cure.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter makes a bold promise that this program can help people with:<br />* ADHD<br />* Depression<br />* Diabetes<br />* Epilepsy<br />* Insomnia<br />* Intestinal problems<br />* Memory problems and much more<br /><br />According to Dr. Perlmutter, the number one cause of brain disease is inflammation. Inflammation is our body's natural response to some kind of stress in the body. Prolonged inflammation leads to a reduction of cellular function followed by cellular destruction. This damages your body and your brain.<br /><br />So, where is this inflammation coming from?  The main source is processed food. The sugars, simple carbs, some fruits and fruity drinks and fast foods that are causing diabetes are also causing brain degeneration. It is causing our bodies and brains to age prematurely due to oxidation - a biological type of \\"rusting\\". Gluten is also our new mortal enemy.<br /><br />How do we avoid this fate worse than death? (or maybe it is death).  Here are a few of Dr. Perlmutter's suggestions.<br /><br />* Skip inflammatory oils like canola or corn oil. Instead, reach for alternatives like coconut or<br />  extra virgin olive oil (I have started popping my popcorn in coconut oil - delicious!)<br />* Incorporate only grass-fed meats into your diet (corn fed meat lacks omega-3)<br />* To get more omega-3s in your diet, reach for supplements like DHA, ALA or fish oil.<br />* Avoid excess fruit & fruit juice. Occasional fruit is OK. Reach for apples or berries.<br />* Get plenty of sleep<br />* Exercise often (230% less chance of Alzheimer's)<br />* Occasional one-day fast (as the seasons change)<br />* Get enough Vitamin D<br /><br />The book is very easy to read and loaded with great information. Dr Perlmutter has a great ability to make medical mumbo-jumbo clear and understandable.  There are numerous studies cited, and the last section includes easy to follow recipes. If you have read any of Dr. Daniel Amen's books like [[ASIN:0307463613 The Amen Solution: The Brain Healthy Way to Get Thinner, Smarter, Happier]], you will find many similarities.<br />If you want to read more about the effects of inflammation on your body, you might want to check out [[ASIN:140194034X Meals That Heal Inflammation: Embrace Healthy Living and Eliminate Pain, One Meal at at Time]].
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a great show. Superbly written and acted.  I found myself wondering if I had been born then if I would have been upstairs or downstairs.  Did the servants ever get much sleep?<br />They have the good guys and the villains. The season finale was unbelievable.  I wished they had not ended that way with the death of &#34;______&#34;  (don't want to spoil it for anyone!)<br />It will be interesting to see what happens next season with the American grandmother (Shirley McLain)  Wish I didn't have to wait so long until it begins. Oh well, will re-watch them all and enjoy all the details and beautiful costumes.

B0098756DC|5.0|Westerns are my favorite type movies and this one has my favorite actors James Stewart, John Wayne and Kevin Costner.
B000YAG00A|5.0|Love the movie,love the extras and love the wide screen. The movie is timeless!!!!! I'm not into war movies but this is the exception.
B006LSZECO|3.0|There has been so much buzz about this book that I had to see what the hype was all about. The book is divided into three sections and I found the first two to be exciting. The final section and ending of the book was more than disappointing, it was the worst way to cap off the investment of my time. The end of the book felt so out-of-place with the first 80% that I wouldn't be surprised if someone else wrote it. &#34;Gone Girl&#34; will now be turned into a movie, which I think is great. BUT...I'm hoping (and strongly encouraging) the author to write a different ending. PLEASE!!!!
B0094KTC6K|5.0|It was good to see this movie. Enjoyed watching it with my granddaughter. Cinematography was brilliant on our high def. TV.
B007N8RULO|3.0|I have a better Spider Solitaire on my laptop that I prefer, but this one is ok. The price is right! :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a really terrific game. Challenging but not maddening. Please send more immediately. It did freeze up on me a couple of times, but all I had to do was restart my Kindle and all was great.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I couldn't understand it for anything and deleted it off my apps. Waste of time.  Very upsetting. Really wanted it to work.
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|Great music!!!!! It's hard to believe OZZY is in his 60s. My Husband listens to the CD everyday over and over again while out driving.
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|I found Kickass 2 just as entertaining as the first film. Filled with action and a generous dose of irreverent comedy, If I didn't know any better I would say John Cleese was giving the director a few pointers. A few scenes reminded me of Monty Python's flying circus in a good way. I was apprehensive at first expecting the movie to take a darker turn just like all the latest hero movies do anymore, but it never did. In my opinion we have enough darkness in real life, we don't need it in our entertainment.<br />There's loads of action, plenty of blood and cringe worthy moments.<br /><br />If you go see this movie wait till the credits end, there's a brief Easter egg to be seen.
034580404X|2.0|I didn't like this story, but the product, price and shipping were great! Not much of a story line....and the adult parts were too frequent, over used.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|I gifted this for a friend who is a Nick Cave fan and she has made a copy to keep in her car and keeps it playing in her cd player at home.  She's recommended it to other musician friends!
098478280X|1.0|First I saw so many 5 stars and believed this is a \\"must have\\" book. And then I found out it's full of errors. Further I found out I learned<br />absolutely nothing from this book. The books are full of program fragments that either don't work or don't make sense. Don't waste money on this junk.
B00E3DC2EW|5.0|There are at least two 99¢ Kindle editions of this book. This one respects formatting preferences, and behaves well (opens to the first page, not the cover page). The Classics To Go edition does not.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love it and hate it at the same time. But it is addictive and very competitive. The levels get harder and harder to get the puzzle pieces. So my advice would be to keep getting hard to get items and save them to barter.
B0094RCD5U|5.0|A gift that was very much appreciated!  I guess this is a great mix of exceptional music from the band.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|level 3: you go to the table and pick up the thing on the floor. you use it to open the bottom cabinet. you use that to put in the computer. there are four cars and the order of those colors is the computer password. then it will give you the code for the thing below the t.v. i think if not there then the shelves next to the t.v. shelves... hope this helped for these confused. and i love this game!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I wish this show was weekly year round.  The characters stories are great.  If zombies really happened your life would really be like this, you would do and see things you would never think of.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|I would honestly say, it is one of the top 100 songs of all time.  Just gets all the pieces in the right places and timing.  Very hard not to move your body to this one.  I did try a few of their other songs and so far only like this one.  Still one spectacular is better than many mediocre.  Have to admit that the theme also did attract my mind.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Normally, I am not a fan of lawyer shows. Just never was my cup of tea. It took my wife several months to convince me to give this show a shot. I am glad she did. We made it through the first season on Amazon Instant in about two days. The cast has a great dynamic, the writing is sharp, and the show is very watchable.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|This story kept me engaged throughout .  You could feel the powerful emotions tugging at this family .  Heartbreaking for everyone.  Well written!
B001NKI60W|5.0|best movie ever!!! I just had to rent it to watch with my 11 yr. old granddaughter, we love it so much we are planning on buying it.
B00D4ABW82|3.0|I love WCAR. Love, love, love them! UWWGTB is one of my favorite albums ever. Every single song on it was perfection.<br />Okay, I'll stop fangirling now.<br />When they released Let These Words Last Forever and Hope a few months ago, I kind of had a hint that We Came As Romans would be going in a different direction with their new album. I didn't like it, but I held my tongue and waited. Boy, was I ever right.<br />I'm all for bands trying new things and going in different directions with their sound. If they did the same thing over and over it would be boring. However, NOTHING on here sounds like any of their previous stuff. It's much more mellow. I don't know if Dave is having problems with his vocal chords, or what, but there's barely any screaming. There are way too many chanty feel good chorus type things going on. Each song sounds indistinguishable from the next. The same general lyrics and ideas are used over and over. I read an interview with Joshua Moore where he explained the theme...and I get it to an extent, but damn man, where is the fire and passion of songs like What I Wished I Never Had? Or the beauty of A War Inside? The lyrics sound like they needed to take a vacation or something before they sat down to write this album.<br />I've been trying to give this more time,(After the brilliance of The Hollow, it took me a while to warm up to Memphis May Fire's Challenger) and I like it more than I did after the first few listens, but I still feel kinda \\"meh\\" every time I listen to Tracing Back Roots.<br />Oddly enough, considering my complaining above, if I had to pick a favorite song on here, it would be \\"I Survive\\".
B00E13ZRFA|4.0|OK, I had to google the words as some of her English accent bllurs some sounds, but the overall effect is mesmerizing.<br />I also love the video and her energy.  energy ramps up in this one/  Just a fun song to listen too.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Some shows suffer from a second season slump, but that was not the case with Suits. They were able to keep the pace up through the second season. I believe we finished watching it in two days as well. When you watch this show you will love Louis Litt. You will want to hate him, and at times you probably will. However, you can't not love someone who is so comfortable being themselves. Seriously, can't believe how much I like this show.
B008518MOW|5.0|I loved all three movies in the series each movie is fresh with a different twist .  I just hope MIB -4 is in the future.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|Science Fiction, sometimes called speculative fiction, has always based itself in today's concerns and projected them into the future. Anyone who doubts this has only to read Heinlein, Bradbury, Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Herbert and many others. Watch Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, The Adjustment Bureau, Star Wars etc., etc. It's always the apparently powerless fighting long odds against an oppressive or much greater force either for their own good or for the good of a class of people. It will always be political, particularly the bigger epics. If you side with the more powerful, you'll hate the upstarts, but most people fall into the 99% and cheer for the little guy. I know I do. It's simplistic to tag this or most films with a political/economic label. My heart (and that of most audiences) is going to be with whoever has to fight for his life against those who want to keep all the good for themselves. Elysium does this well like the best scifi. You root for Damon's character. What elevates Elysium is the acting of both Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley, in particular. And I'm always going to love Jodie Foster no matter what she does.<br /><br />I love a good action flick that tells a story I can get involved in,particularly one that pays such close attention to artistic detail. My only criticism is that it wasn't shot in 3-D. Damon says it should not have been and so was shot in 2-D. I respectfully disagree. The story is solid, the action lends itself to immersion, and the views of Elysium itself and the ruined Earth should have been in depth, the way it would be in real life.<br /><br />But I won't quarrel with the director's choice. The story, the action, the speculation, the science are all grounded in \\"could be possible\\" and make me shiver. The actors are exceptional. Our movie money was well spent. Bravo Blomkamp, Damon et. al. You have my vote that you all make another one together.<br /><br />I will update this when the blu-ray is released.
0449000729|4.0|Enjoying this so far.  It is deep like his other novels.  I look forward to reading London and Paris.  Good
B00D6QUMWG|4.0|There aren't too many sopranos adept in Verdi these days, especially when you think of the past 2 decades, when even the MET could not secure a prima donna of this genre in Angela Gheorghiu and Karita Mattila.<br />From Russia, Anna Netrebko stormed the western operatic scene with high hopes of a lirico spinto soprano in the making with her early triumph as Violetta Valery in Russia. Anna kept the houses waiting for 1 more decade.<br />The waiting can be said to be worthwhile, as this summer, when Netrebko issues her first studio recording in 5 years to commemorate the anniversary of Giuseppe Verdi. This album includes works from Macbeth, I Vespre di Siliciani, Il Trovatore, Giovanna D'Arco and Don Carlo. Giovanna D'Arco, Macbeth and I Vespre are relatively less performed on stage these days. Netrebko's assumption of these relative rarities are highly welcome indeed.<br />The switching from a coloratura soprano to Verdi especially as Lady Macbeth, a considered mezzo-soprano role, require preparation as well as guts. Netrebko does not disappoint, for though she can never be considered as the same type as Maria Callas in terms of fach, as a lirico-cum-spinto type of lyrical soprano, the timbre has sufficient range to accommodate the vocal demands of these roles. Throughout this album, Netrebko is able to command a consistent tonal production for the different scenes and arias, with varied timbre: no bulging notes, no abrupt change in registers, no shrillness that easily associates with these pieces. In short, she handles the vocal demands with real competence, and even considerable aplomb.<br />As for characterisation, she may not be totally successful in differentiating Lady Macbeth from Leonora, or Elisabetta, et. al. But this may only be a marginal problem, for the scenes, if put in context, would fit the plot as glove to hand on stage, aided by efficient acting. If you ask for the `verismo type' of dramatic interpretation for these Verdi pieces, however, look elsewhere.<br />It needs reminding that, with Anna's recent release, that the operatic world has not had a full Verdian soprano album for some years, since the last issue by Sondra Radvanovsky, more a dramatic soprano than a Verdian spinto.<br />This is a musically lovely album, and will surely please aficionados greatly, if not all connosieurs.where.<br />It needs reminding that, with Anna's recent release, that the operatic world has not had a full Verdian soprano album for some years, since the last issue by Sondra Radvanovsky, more a dramatic soprano than a Verdian spinto.<br />This is a musically lovely album, and will surely please aficionados greatly, if not all connosieurs.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|I'm a big fan of historical drama - this is very well done. Daniel Day Lewis does not disappoint. I've watched this movie more than 10 times and will watch it again.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I gave the movie 5 stars because the U.S. of A is severely lacking when it comes to science fiction movies and I liked this movie.<br /><br />As a teenager in the 80s, I never understood the Tom Cruise (and Brad Pitt) phenomenon. I think that Tom Cruise had gotten a lot better as he's gotten older. And for me that says a lot; I wish I could say the same for Brad Pitt (Note: I hated Brad Pitts version of World War Z, I mean whats the point? If you're not going to stay true to the book, why not just hire a bunch of screenwriters to write a zombie movie and slap a title on it?.....) Sorry....<br /><br />I enjoyed the storyline, and unlike other boys and girls out there, no, I did not wonder why Morgan Freeman wore shades throughout the entire movie. I am perturbed that people have many questions they feel were unanswered, so I'm going to answer some of those questions:<br /><br />◾if the aliens have the technology to build enormous universe-traversing spaceships, build and deploy hundreds of enormous factories from that ship that are capable of draining energy from out oceans over the course of decades, and deploy hundreds of nigh-bulletproof drones armed with laser cannons to protect them, why in the hell did they need an army of Tom Cruises (TC) and Emily Riseboroughs (ER)?<br /><br />Well, boys and girls, in this instance it was one super-brain narcissitic alien running the show with a lot of drones. Do you really think a narcissitic alien would allow its own kind to live and rule along side it? No. \\"Sally\\", was the only alien. It deployed numerous clones of Tom and Emily because it couldn't leave it's triangular vehicle without putting itself in danger, and enter earth's atmosphere to fight, it's too large and it would be vulnerable.  It required an army of humans to defeat humans. Just like we have antibiotics....(what is happening in our education system that this question was even posed?)<br /><br />◾what happened to the other at-least-50 Tom Cruises and at-least-51 Emily Rossboroughs?<br />The ones in the ship? they died along with \\"Sally\\"<br />The ones on earth? Well, who knows?  But it must've been hell waking up that morning.<br /><br />* Why Does \\"Tech 49\\" Have Jack Harper's Memories if He's a Clone?<br />That is a good question and I'm glad it was asked because that means a majority of the population see clones as individualistic, having their own personalities and souls. My only answer is because it's fiction.<br /><br />I would recommend Oblivion, I found it entertaining and afterwards, like many, asked many questions that had nothing to do with the movie. Let's remember that this is fiction, and most screen writers do not have a technical degree, that's why it's fiction.least-51 Emily Rossboroughs?<br />The ones in the ship? they died along with \\"Sally\\"<br />The ones on earth?

140006922X|4.0|I guess I agree.  Paul didn't actually ever meet Jesus, even though he said he did WELL AFTER the Resurrection.  I always thought Paul had some insightful life lessons but they were not Jesus' lessons.  AND we don't worship Paul.  Well, maybe some people do!

B00CF34B2I|3.0|I downloaded this game four days ago. I like the gameplay and purchased the full version. Then everything went wrong. After multiple automatic updates it stopped working. When I tried to play it would open to a black screen, then exit back to the previous page. I then removed it from my device and reloaded it, which should be easy and pain free since it's in the cloud. No such luck. Now it wants me to repurchase the game. We'll see what happens next.
B00AM7E4LM|3.0|I am a great fan of the author, his PersonalMBA has influenced me quite a bit and has helped me get some skills that helped me as an entrepreneur. So this review is coming from someone who had high expectation levels.  This book however, lacks the rigor that Josh applies to his efforts. First lets go with whats right with the book that made it deserve the three stars that I have reviewed it at:<br /><br />1. Simple 10 steps to acquire new skills. Josh is clear right from the beginning on the gap between learning and mindful practice.<br />2. Excellent examples. Often such books lack application examples. For a good part of the book Josh breaks down 6 skills he acquired over a year, spending about an hour of practice daily. These skills are not trivial. When you go through the application examples you get an idea of the diligent person that the author is.<br /><br />My issues:<br />1. Low focus on technique: Perhaps since the 10 steps he describes are simple, josh spends very little space to the steps itself.<br />2. Lack of system focus: I have always found those messages resonating where authors describe a process , methodology with acronyms, metaphors. This make sense since any system has to be applicable, therefore a need to easily recall the steps. This book sorely misses a systems perspective to learning a new skill<br />3. While Josh describes 6 skills he acquired, the mapping between actions and what he did ultimately isnt very clear<br />4. Often author laments that regular practice is needed, but there is little material, techniques devoted to effective practice. I believe this is the single biggest flaw of the book. Practice is clearly defined as keystone activity to acquire a new skill, but there is little material that covers the barriers to practice or what constitutes 'mindful practice'<br /><br />Finally perhaps if you didnt follow his other works, this book may pleasantly surprise you with its easy to read style, examples. That said, if you are someone who has either read his earlier works or expect depth in the subject, this isnt for you
B00CATSONE|5.0|Firstly, thank you to the author for offering this book for free.  It was inspirational. I've heard many things about Mr. Tesla over the years but I wanted to know a little more. This man was truly tapped into his creativity. Fascinating to read about all the creative and groundbreaking contributions to science he made...WOW!<br /><br />I devoured this book in just a few hours. It was a very enjoyable read. Also I liked how the author talks about other creative geniuses throughout history and he encourages the reader to tap into their creative genius just as Tesla and others before us did.  Thank you for writing this book and offering it for free! I do believe my creativity has been sparked! Cheers~

B00CKOQC9C|5.0|This was the first 'hard' SF I ever read and I've been in love with it ever since. I was in third grade and have always been a Mars freak. Other than Earth, Mars is my favorite planet. This series of tales (poorly adapted by NBC as a mini-series). The situations, the characters, the stories themselves are all just so brilliant and visual. This is one of my favorite novels ever.
B00CC9P99E|5.0|Few people can turn a phrase like Lloyd Cole. A listen to his discography is like a glimpse into his life.  You know exactly where he is from what is revealed in any particular work. It's like growing older with a dear friend, holding his hand when he needs support and slapping him on the back when he deserves congratulations. &#34;Standards&#34; continues this 'friendship&#34; with Cole meeting all expectations and delivering more of that  personal glimpse that makes his work exceptional.

B0090SI582|4.0|You need to understand that origins is before wolverine became the mutant and man he is today. Cmon ppl, you gave it a bad review for dumb reasons and it shouldnt be compared to a movie set in the future just because its about wolverine as well. Origins we learned who he was before his memory wiped. Not rmembering led him to frustration and becoming animal like and we learn that in x men 1-3. The wolverine is who he is after his decision on kiling gene. Its called character developmemt people. Stop grading this movie or any other marvel movie like if its up for an academy award
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I liked the story but would have liked a bit more detail about what went on in the interim years - it was tantalizing but unsatisfactory.  However, still a good read, fast and fun.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons of D.A..  My anticipation of the third season was well rewarded (even if I was totally blown away by the cliffhanger ending).  Of course, now it will be difficult to wait until next year to watch Season 4.  I'm curious as to why all of the BBC shows have such abbreviated seasons?  My only complaint would be getting through all of Season 3 too speedily.  My fault.<br /><br />The viewing quality was very good.  Can't think of any complaints!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent show.  Enjoying it every morning while on the treadmill.  Just started season 2 and it is as good as the first season.
1936719118|5.0|Very interesting & enlightening book from the founder of CD Baby, Derek Sivers. Although it didn't answer all of my questions, it was very insightful as to how he started the company, & the unfortunate way things transpired which caused his departure. I never knew about how it all came about, nor how it all went down, & it will forever remain a mystery as to how in the world my cd's ended up being distributed by CD Baby....when originally I was signed to another online distributor that disappeared overnight!<br /><br />Whether your a customer of CD Baby, or an artist whose cd's are distributed by them, I think this book is a good read. Also intended as lessons learned & passed on for anyone starting a business!

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|If you have a favorite idiom of hard rock music, you're likely to hear it on this album.  From Deep Purple to Queen to Jesus Christ Superstar, \\"...Like Clockwork\\" runs down the history of the last 40 or 50 years of hard rock, but does it in a way that feels entirely new and fresh.  Other reviewers have noted that this album benefits from repeated listenings, and that is definitely the case.  The more I listen to it, the more I'm convinced that this is one of the greatest hard rock albums ever made.  I just love this music.  If I was stranded on a deserted island and could only bring a few albums to listen to, this would definitely be one of them.

B008XKSW7M|1.0|I don't know how so many talented actors could be in this movie, yet have it turn out like a giant turd.<br /><br />Just seems like a rushed script with tons and tons of Hollywood studio exec notes.<br /><br />Not even Chris Rock, and the comic relief of the guys on their baby-walks can do anything to save this.<br /><br />Just avoid.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|This is not my normal type of story, but on a whim, I decided to download the movie. I was aware of the book but never really checked out what it was about. Mostly, it's an adventure -- or rather, the ability of a man to tell a great story about an adventure. At the end, you're not really sure if it was a true story, but by that time it doesn't matter because it was such an awesome one. The general gist is that a boy lives in India with his family, who owns a zoo. They are getting their zoo land taken away so they have to move away (to america, I think). They still own all the animals, so they load all the animals onto a ship and set sail. But there is a bad storm and the ship goes down, but not before the boy manages to free some of the animals. The boy is the only one to survive. He drifts along in the middle of the sea in a dingy. He has a monkey and a zebra with him and a very aggressive hyena, who keeps attacking the other animals. The boy, Pi, stays as far away from the hyena as possible, which is hard when you are in a tiny boat. His tiger from the zoo swims up and gets in the boat. Fortunately, he sets that hyena straight, but unfortunately, he is a serious threat to Pi. So Pi spends most of his days floating on a man-made raft outside the boat, while he tries to come to terms with the tiger. Eventually, they learn to &#34;co-exist&#34; in the boat.<br /><br />My summary does not do this story justice. Like I said, this isn't my normal genre of movie, but it held my attention and interest all the way through. I would highly recommend watching -- or even reading -- The Life of Pi. There is a reason it gets such good reviews.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|Main ingredient; Laurence Fishburne on television with his wife playing his wife.<br />Yes, the gore is a bit overdone but the ensemble cast is great and it is interesting to watch<br />Hannibal play with his food while he is shopping.<br />I can't wait for season 2.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|I don't like zombies! I don't like them in comedies (i.e. Shaun of the Dead), I don't like them in pseudo-psychological thrillers (i.e. 28 Days Later) and I certainly didn't like them on Prime Time TV, but I am a fan of Norman Reedus (before he shot to superstardom as Daryl Dixon) and I had been hounded by friends and family to check out this show. A friend lent me the first two seasons on DVD and after one very long week where I think I slept with my bedroom door locked every night, I got through both seasons and found....I wanted more. Even if you aren't a fan of the horror genre, this show is for you. I learned very quickly that The Walking Dead is not a show about zombies - sure there a LOT of zombies - but about what happens to people when the world goes to crap and all you have left are a few individuals fighting for a small slice of life during a difficult situation.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is no &#34;Shawshank Redemption&#34; but it is great. So much so that I am now a lifelong fan and can't wait until season 4 starts in October.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I used to watch this in reruns when I was a teenager. The station that carried it was a fringe station, so all I ever saw was images through the snow, but I still loved it.<br />Now I can watch the episodes in living color. Sure, I can see the cheesy special effects, but for its time, this was lightyears ahead of other shows. I can also appreciate the subtle humor better as an adult. And after years of hearing William Shatner jokes, I realized he was a great actor, and the trio of lead actors worked so well together.<br />It is so nice to be able to go back in time with the crew of the USS Enterprise and see the series as it was meant to be seen. I have a greater appreciation of Gene Roddenberry and his vision - few men have made such a lasting impact. Thank you, Amazon Prime, for making this available.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this for my son, who loves Dr. Who. He has not put it down since it came in the mail- absolutely loves it.<br /><br />It is a toy, made of plastic, so I would not recommend this for anyone who may be a serious collector. You are getting what you pay for- and the price on this is what I would expect to pay for a toy if I were purchasing it from a toy store.<br /><br />Overall a fun gift for the child Whovian.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The idea of this product is terrific, however, it doesn't work at all as easily as promised.  First off, I couldn't get it to stream my browser.  There were &#34;no cast devices found&#34; even though it was set up on my tv and said ready to cast.  Apparently, there is some issue with firewalls on routers, if you have one.  Google's tech support was ZERO help...they were certainly friendly, but had no more knowledge than the average person!  Quite surprising to be sure.  They promise to email you back within 24hrs....that ended up being more like 4 days...and all of their suggestions were things I'd already done or the other tech person told me to do.  All in all, a good idea that needs improvement.  Oh another thing, THERE IS NO CAST OPTION ON NETFLIX, IT EVEN TELLS ME CHROME IS NOT A SUPPORTED BROWSER...WTF??!<br />Pluses:  Very well made, low priced<br />Minuses:  Really lags down wireless when casting browser, can't cast full screen...which makes the browser casting kinda worthless, can't use it with Netflix(isn't that the point???!)<br />I no longer have it plugged in, I've used the free 3 months to Netflix and went back to streaming via my PS3.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Truly enjoyable adventure touching on factual history and science. Rollins' use of theoretical physics is easily understood and with an open mind acceptable.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a fun way to play alone with out having to find a partner.  It works well for me.
B005LCECU6|4.0|Quality sound for the day/time of the recording. Songs are the cornerstone of the foundation that is Rush. Showing their start in blues driven rock, and the beginning of epic lyrics by the 1 & only...Neil Peart! Geddy's vocals are young & from his soul. And there's only a few shredder's that can compare to Alex's power & finesse. These 3 are monster musicians, who after almost 40 years together, have continued to do it THEIR WAY!! Exploring, creating, and filling the world with beautiful music :)
B007AL48UK|1.0|The tiles don't clear properly forcing you to make less advantageous moves I gave up and deleted. Looking at the reviews it seems this flaw occurred due to a recent upgrade but it hasn't been fixed. Unplayable as is. Hope the devs take note as it could be a nice little game.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|is simple, works . it does what suppose to it would be great if had other options. but overall usedful
1451626096|3.0|I was really looking forward to this book dispite the mediocre reviews.  I have always thought Elizabeth of York was one of the most fascinating characters in English history.  The problem with this book is it feels long and boring and REPETATIVE.<br /><br />The book is mostly filled with the following:  Elizabeth's mother in law does not like her, Elizabeth doesnt like her husband/he doesnt like her, now they are in love, now he doesnt trust her, she has a kid, repeat. . . .<br /><br />By 1/2 way through I was ready to get off the hampster wheel.<br /><br />The worst part is that I think the most interesting part of the book would have been her time with Richard-and the book starts after that has already ended.  What?  That's why I wanted to read the book.  This was a huge wasted opportunity.<br /><br />Your better off going back and re reading Lady of Rivers and The White Queen than picking up this one.
B00009L1UP|5.0|This is my favorite of Queensryche's efforts. Geoff Tate's vocals are great on this album. My favorite cuts are of course Jet City Woman and Silent Lucidity. This is a good mix that is classic and a bit on the heavy side.
0385347774|3.0|The main character in this novel is just plain crazy, deliberate and evil.. Hard to sympathize with her.  A little unbelievable in the ending as it seems the author just didn't know how to end the story so just reached for anything.
B0093QE37S|5.0|If your a Kathryn Hepburn, Cary Grant and James Stewart fan your gonna love this movie. It's funny and most entertaining.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|I have read every single book by Jane Austen and avidly collect all the movie/ series versions of her novels. Out of the three Persuasion versions I have come across to date this is certainly my favourite and the one that is most faithful to the novel. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are simply brilliant as Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. The people who complain about their looks and make-up have clearly never read the book. They are both older than typical Austen characters, they have gone through a tough time emotionally, they are sad. Their romance and emotional connection is subtle and restrained in keeping with the period. I was amazed by the array of emotions and nuances the cast was able to convey through gestures and looks alone. I am particularly impressed by the contrast their body language makes with their stiff Victorian dialogue, emphasizing their inner turmoil, their need to maintain appearances while secretly being in love but not at liberty to express it.<br /><br />If you have read the book and have an understanding of the era you will not fail to enjoy this movie. If you expect Hollywood flash and face lifts, along with Harlequin type groping you will be sorely disappointed.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I saw the preview for the movie so I read the book. Good read. Short sweet and left me wanting more every time I closed it.  Can't wait to see the movie and how the screw it up!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abby is so enjoyable and exciting cannot wait for next season. Good for the whole family to watch. Just watched the all seasons again  on my Kindel.
B000MCIBAW|4.0|I bought this CD to replace my copy on cassette. The best thing about this effort is the excellent cuts that didn't receive a lot of radio play back in the day, but are all classics.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|This is fun to personalize with different colors and icons.the reminders appear on your updates notifications.  Just wish the carousel icon' s date would change and display would appear each day.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is one of the best games I have ever played. It's between this and The Last of Us, actually.<br /><br />The art is beautiful, breathtaking and the music is poignant and emotionally evocative. It's a beautiful game with a beautiful storyline-- a journey that'll definitely make marvel at the sheer vastness of the world in which you are immersed.<br /><br />The other two games were just lovely bonuses. Flower is also a favorite of mine (I don't understand how you can get emotionally attached to a flower petal, but you do). And it also has beautiful music and is absolutely an emotional journey. It's wonderful.<br /><br />These games are SO WORTH IT. Buy the collector's edition, seriously. It's the best investment I've made in a while.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|great for a series only problem is they are tied in to each other so tight good action in most episodes
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Great film about knowing who you are and finding value in what you do.  Fun characters and music make it a winner for the whole family.
0385341008|2.0|The authors try to tap into several inclinations of potential  readers:  their belief in the restorative value of reading; a fondness for epistolary novels; sympathy for the besieged English people;  an interesting historical period. But this book fails for me for several reasons.  First, there are truly tragic events - for example, the death of a slave worker, the eventual death of Elizabeth, and the orphaning of the child Kit.  Yet the overall tone of the book is humorous and cheery, and that is disconcerting.  Second, the authors try to create an element of suspense about the outcome of the attraction between Juliet and Dawsey by withholding from us the fact that Sidney is gay until well into the book.  Third, the difficulties of life in general are glossed over. Wouldn't it be hard for even a charming stranger to insert herself into the long established island social groups and gain their confidence?  Wouldn't it be hard and take quite a long while to win over a very young child who recently lost both father and mother?  Wouldn't there be at least some reasonable resistance to Juliet's becoming Kit's guardian after the other islanders had been caring for this child?  Yes, yes and yes.  A better book that honestly conveys the tension and tragedy of the Guernsey occupation is Lying with the Enemy  by Tim Binding.
B002CIY8EM|3.0|After all the years of hype I thought it would be better.  But I suppose for being one of the first to discuss the subject it was OK.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app for free.  It calculates each step and retains the equation as you go. Super recommend
B001BKTEZA|2.0|this book's story is down right aweful. sure there is a lot of symbolism and meaning behind it. but the entertainment value of it is nothing. the book is just a long mellow story of a series of unfortunate problems for this poor oregon family.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I love this book.  Great to read for summer.  It was a quick read that held my interest and had no slow parts.  Cheers to Mira for a great fun book!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I'll be honest, I have no idea if this is Batman 2 or Batman 3, but if it is the one with the gay cowboy then it should get 10 stars. I mean in Batman he makes a pencil disappear through a man's eye, yet in Broke Back Mountain that pencil went somewhere else.<br /><br />If this is the third and final Batman by the Inception guy, then this was also an awesome movie. I didn't get to catch it in the theaters, not because of the shootings, but because of posture issues, but when it came out, I rented it, turned out the lights and turned up the surround sound and five minutes later got out of bed to turn the volume down a bit.<br /><br />Still not sure if he died or not, but who cares, it's a movie and to me BeatleJuice will always be batman anyway.
B00EFNXPFK|3.0|I love john Mayers music.. but this was NOT his best work... ... i still support the music.. but i demand more from him then this... He has a new relationship that seems to be working so maybe that may be his downfall.. i dunno..

B003UBTX7C|1.0|Disappointing.  Balducci is a much better writer than this book.  Confusing and rambling.  Could barely finish it.  Sorry to report this.
0895260131|1.0|Im an avid reader of Bernard Lewis, Karen Armstrong and others, so I read this looking for different opinions. Thats not really what you get in this book. A lot of the facts are wrong or misquoted for, probably, shock value.<br /><br />The author doesnt really treat Islam as a legitimate subject to be studied and treated objectively. I understand he's self-educated, and I applaud that, but he's not objective at all in his treatment of it. More annoyingly, he seems to be making lots of comments and statements purely for shock value and to sell books. If you're looking for a more critical look at Islam and its history, its best to look elsewhere.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Loved the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. Hated this book. Learned a lot about architecture but the story was terrible and completely boring, although the premise is something to think about.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This is a great love story. I enjoyed it, couldn't hardly put it down. I love a good love story, & this was one. Thanks.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so much fun! I wish that there was one for Equestria Girls! I wish that the store wouldn't have such expensive stuff. it is really hard to get more ponies and shops. Escpesially the Canterlot shops. 40,000 bits for one store! That's my only problem.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This was so boring even for the grandchildren.  It just sits in the games folder.  No one ever opens it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This is one of the most fun times I've had watching a film! Christoph Waltz is simply brilliant and he alone is worth recommending to anyone. Awesome.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Really enjoyed the game.  Sad there were only 10 levels.  Cant wait for triple that many.  Great brain puzzle solving.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Different levels within multiple games plus slots - so many games to choose from - definitely worth the time - there are times that I'm on it for hours.
B005FPT51K|4.0|We got this to supplement the audio monitor that we already have.  Baby has taken to making noises throughout the night, but doesn't really wake up. This way we can check in on him to see if he is awake or just making noise.<br /><br />The decision point was that we could use our phones to watch the kid in his crib, rather than having yet another screen to look at or plug in.  This probably means that we are going to stay and iPhone family for a few more years. Set up was insanely easy, once I read that you need to actually plug it into the router before it would register on WiFi.  From there, it's no harder than setting up a wireless printer.<br /><br />It does take a few seconds (up to 30) to load the app and get a video feed, the quality is decent.  I like the infrared so we can see him at night.  Though it feels like we are watching a bad episode of Ghost Hunters or Paranormal Activity.  I half expect to see Toby open his room door or move the mobile at any moment.<br /><br /> Downside is that if you leave it running on your phone all the time it will eat through your battery just as fast as any other app; so keep that charger handy.
B002ZG983M|5.0|Just for the record, I'd like to say that this movie is awesome!<br /><br />even though it wasn't much what I expected, cause I was actually thinking that &#34;Kick-Ass&#34; was gonna be doing all the ASS kicking and have cool moves. But it appears that he was a novice and wasn't trained how to fight. But at least what made up for it would be &#34;Hit-Girl&#34; and her father &#34;Big Daddy&#34; those two actually kicked ass and mostly did all the fighting. Not to mention Kick Ass was saved by Hit Girl in that scene where it was a room full of thugs.<br /><br />Overall I'm impressed and I'm glad I didn't regret buying this movie. I wanted to watch this because the second movie was on commercials and the commercial made it look like it would be AWESOME and it intrigued me. If I am to Watch Kick Ass 2 then pretty much I gotta see this first one. I hope the Second one is good as it was shown in the commercials. I'm guessing that this movie was the start of something awesome to continue on part 2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandchildren love this.  They have it loaded onto many devices and they each pull it up and have contests about who can go the longest and collect the most prizes.  It keeps them engaged for quite a while.  I think it helps with their response time.
B00466HM28|5.0|I bought this keyboard to keep in my bag for when I travel it's very easy to setup and use with Logic Pro on my macbook. It's an important tool in my audio arsenal because when I come up with an idea I like to try and hear what it sounds like in Logic and lay down the foundation to my piece before I start to build upon it. This keyboard is perfect for this task. There are 8 drum pads for laying down drum patterns and 8 knobs for tuning your synthesizer or changing attack and balance. Overall this is definently the ideal keyboard for novice producers and an amazing tool for producers on the go. And for the price you can't go wrong.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great series. Super entertaining. We have enjoyed watching every single episode.  Why does amazon require so many words in their reviews?

B006DHAT5K|5.0|this is a great one.  good for the days when you don't want to think anymore after work, just sit on the couch, eat some popcorn and laugh at Anna Faris's right-on comedic timing and ogle chris evans's abs.  very nice.  and the puppet-guy, don't forget the puppet-guy.  I don't know if it's good for guys (my roommate, who's a guy, left after the first half) but I love it.
B009WUBERW|2.0|too unrealistic. story line is awful. Surprised this series has an audience. After watching expendables 2, don't care about anymore expendables.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I really like the trilogy.. and now in this presentation we got not only the movies but a fair quantity of extra features that make it ever better (for example the documentary of batmobiles across serie, comics and movies is awesome). Only bitter point for me is that I cannot redeem the ultraviolet cupon because its only valid on US.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Love this one, it's a classic. Saw the Miyazaki film and had to read the actual novel... Have to say, the story here is just as good if not better; they're not exactly the same, but both are wonderful.

This CD sounds like s***.<br />This recording sounds like they have severe hangovers & the sound engineer hasn't cleaned his ears in the last 20 years.<br />The drummer is off, the vocals are indistinguishable and buried in the mix. The guitar and bass sound like the amps were laying face down in the mud.<br />WHAT IS THIS???<br /><br />I have no idea why there are so many 5 star reviews for this.<br />This is outright garbage and I'm pissed that I paid for it.<br />ELECTRIC WIZARD SUCKS!!!
0061906220|5.0|I was first introduced to Pete at a story time with my grandchildren.  This is one of my favorite Pete books.  I love the song and just how fun it it.  Pete the Cat has several books and/or adventures and they are geared for younger preschool children.  All would be great for themes and activities in a preschool setting or just at home with preschool children.  Would not be hard to add on learning activities to these books.

B001DF68MA|3.0|Initially I bought a WEE-Ride bike mount because I just wasn't sure how much leg room my 2 year old would actually have between the handle bars and the seat with the iBert. But after a week of using the WEE-Ride I noticed two problems. First the bar-mount for the WEE-Ride seat was very difficult to climb over because of how high it mounted on my bike. And second, I kept scratching my knees on the side of the seat. I mounted the iBert seat today and was surprised at how much room my son actually had in the leg area. It is not near as tight a fit as it appeared in the pictures and he still has plenty of growing room. One ride around the block and I am sold. I don't have any trouble getting on and off my bike now, and I am not straddling the seat so I don’t hit my knees.

0385751532|3.0|I would say that this book is definitely holocaust-lite in terms of factual content. I agree with the other reviewers who point out that the naiveté demonstrated by the protagonist shows greater consistency with the developmental standards [my own experiences, not having any professional training] of a 6-7 year old. There also seems to be a disconnect with the well-documented environment of 1940s Berlin/Germany - a  nine-year-old should have be indoctrinated, especially a child of a high-ranking SS official.<br /><br />That said, I have met many adults (males, mostly) who have little to no recollection of their elementary years. And then there are the holocaust deniers. Which is where I think the real power of this story is. Remember from statistical theory that you don't prove the null hypothesis, you find evidence to reject it (Fisher). So if we take Holocaust denial/revisionist as the null hypothesis, what would life look like for the protagonist? Would it be as described in the book? I (and many reviewers) would argue no way!, given the voluminous documentation to the contrary  (> 400,000 ghettos and camps, [...] And that is evidence to reject the denial/revisionist claims. But that is reading the book as an adult. A child or pre-teen reading the book would need a lot of guidance to reach this conclusion. And they may be turned off by the simplicity of the characters before ever getting to the discussion.<br /><br />The truth is, many of us simply don't have the life experiences to connect with events as gruesome as the Holocaust. Just last week I heard a keynote speaker lamenting delays of more than 5s when on the computer (first-world problems, most definitely). Certainly the emotional distance assigned to the father is not standard practice in modern families (those of us with parents born at the turn of the century may remember a time when the expectation was for  fathers to  disdain changing diapers, organizing meals or mingling with young children). I certainly have never experienced anything resembling the physical, let alone emotional, abuse that Holocaust victims/survivors did. I'm guessing that many more readers will identify with the idea of being clueless, bored, or spoiled.<br /><br />Overall the book is a quick read, very predictable towards the end. But it may be a decent jumping off point for discussion, especially keeping the chapter titles in mind.

B00EI6E0QM|5.0|With the release of her new single 'Applause' from the much anticipated upcoming album 'ARTPOP,' Lady GaGa demonstrates once again her fearless determination to go against the grain with a musical offering that was simply Born This Way.<br /><br />Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, slightly better known by her stage name - Lady GaGa - marches to the beat of a different drummer in 'Applause,' daring, yes even welcoming criticism with a pop offering which significantly departs from the generic, safe and lackluster musical formulas clung to by most other pop artists today, leaving us completely Starstruck.<br /><br />Mother Monster is taking a completely different tack through Disco Heaven compared to, for example, Katy Perry in her new 'Roar' single.<br /><br />While Perry's song might be considered more \\"user friendly\\" in a populist sense,  GaGa's 'Applause' is willing to take the chance of sacrificing a few potential Beautiful Dirty Rich casual listeners for the sake of furthering the artform itself and she is, in our humble opinion, reigning as The Queen of pop by virtue of this effort.<br /><br />Some might even say that with 'Applause,' GaGa has signaled her intent to tread a darker path to The Edge Of Glory as it traverses philosophical and musical strata which lie outside the commonplace as we journey with her during this Dance In The Dark.<br /><br />Indeed, the buzz on 'ARTPOP' seems to indicate that the entire Rock Show feel of the new album enters a realm beyond Words.<br /><br />We are left Speechless when contemplating GaGa's songwriting ability, as many of her lyrics operate on at least two and sometimes three levels at once, a Sexy Ugly multidimensionality which casual listeners seldom appreciate as do Yoü And I.<br /><br />For such a willingness to push through limits, possibly even leaving behind some of the Money Honey, while shattering the former Bad Romance we had with pop music \\"robothink\\" , the lovely Signorina Germanotta garners our Captivateddevotion to spreading her Fame far and wide.<br /><br />'Applause' will definitely be Living On The Radio for a very long time in the truest GaGa Fashion.<br /><br />We can barely contain ourselves as we fidget restlessly and wait breathlessly to get our Teeth into 'ARTPOP,' which drops in its entirety on 11-11-13, undoubtedly offering us Something Crazy.<br /><br />Paws Up, Little Monsters, put on your Poker Face and go crash a critic!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Would recommend this book to anyone. I first read these series growing up in intermediate instead of paying attention in class haha. Am thoroughly enjoying reading them again now, very well written.
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|Mystical and Magical...The acting is superb...You will believe Merlin has these powers...The stories keep you<br />On tne edge of your seat....the horsemanship and sword fights so realistic and the chemistry and humor between<br />Merlin and Prince Arthur..excellent.  Having seen all the episodes in this series....this third one is  possibly the best!<br />Very interesting and well done!

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I purchased all three seasons of Downton Abby for myself (and another set of 1&2 as a gift).  I was under the impression that if one purchases the first 3 seasons that they would be put on a list for the 4th season as soon as the first episode of Season 4 is shown on TV.  Please respond my e-mail # barron8306@att.net
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|Ordered this adapter to use for packet captures off customers networks so I wanted something that could hypothetically do gigabit speeds, figured a USB 3.0 adapter would be best to come close to it, but I also wanted the ability to use it in any computer not just my newer ones with 3.0 so it needed to be backwards compatible. It works great in both 3.0 and 2.0 contrary to other reviews. I tested this in both Linux Mint 14, Windows 7, and Windows 8. I will test on Mac OSX tomorrow and update. The only reason I marked it as 4/5 stars is the chipset used in it seems to not be recognized right off the bat by Linux and requires you to compile a simple driver which anyone should be able to handle. The Windows Driver provides some pretty great features you can set if you want, but also works right off the bat with no configuration after the driver is installed. Bottom line, it works great, solid construction, works in USB 2.0/3.0, and the price is pretty cheap for what you get.

B00008T3DJ|5.0|why oh why can't I get it on dvd?This is one fine movie, and was definatly way before it's time.
B001P3SA94|4.0|I really like this movie, for the type. I say like, because of the sound volume (not high enough) even though I tried it on more than one machine.  The movie was much better than I expected. Reminiscent of  THE BODYGUARD but not quite the same.<br />I have watched it over and over,...even though volume is not quite up to par, it's still seriously enjoyable..
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My favourite interactive game, it's so addictive best bingo game I've played so far even though it freezes sometimes I just love it. There is lots going on and I like reading all the chat
B00DC8O6T8|3.0|This CD is what you would expect from a 'breakthrough' album.  Safe and Sound received about twice as much production effort and attention as the remaining tracks.  That being said, Capitol Cities had at least 4 good ideas that they capture on this album.  That being said, Farah Fawcett Hair with Andre 3000 is not one of them.  I would recommend you buy the single rather than the album, so that you optimize your allowance/student loan surplus/In N Out paycheck.  I bought the whole album so I could get high quality tracks to remix.  That is the only reason to buy the CD, unless you like to make assemblage art with CDs.
B00COGXGNQ|2.0|The book was wonderful and the movie was cheesy. The ending would have been much better if it followed the book.
B00BWJ91XK|5.0|Really feel like it was a great beginning to series. Thought it followed the book fairly well. Another great movie from this series of books!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|If my high school voice ever appeared in novel form, there's a good chance it'd resemble Charlie. He's naïve and precocious and childish and odd and enlightening and invisible and seen and I could have tried pot brownies and would have had no idea I was stoned unless someone told me and I would have wanted a milkshake and I can't dance but I can do the sway and I could have witnessed a rape and had no idea what had happened because I was a kid. I could have confided to my teacher about a tragic event that happened at home and I avoided beer like it was the second coming of Satan and I could have written letters to an anonymous pen pal and I did chores to earn my allowance and I wrote poems in college and I went out with a girl who had what could be described as low self-esteem and I was totally infatuated with her for a period of time and I like unconventionally beautiful women. I love music and books and I overanalyze and outthink myself on a fairly regular basis and speculate and contemplate and can probably be considered a deep thinker in a world that doesn't seem to plan or speculate or think too deeply and I can keep secrets and my mom tells me she loves my stories and I type on a computer and I hate goodbyes and I had a teacher that thought I was special, albeit it was the third grade and sometimes I feel so much that my body has to physically shut itself down otherwise I'd start frying brain cells. I think too fast.<br /><br />But I didn't smoke copious amounts of weed and cigarettes or eat pot brownies or trip on LSD and *BEGIN SPOILER* I wasn't sexually molested and I didn't spend time with a psychiatrist or spend two months in a hospital because I had a mental breakdown *END SPOILER*.<br /><br />But I did love THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER with my whole being and I don't feel as though it will cause me any mental breaks to feel this much and to be totally caught up in Charlie's world and to feel fortunate for Charlie because he has friends like Patrick and Sam and Mary Elizabeth and that he was able to mail letters to his anonymous friend to help him through his first year of high school and that he was able to go to parties where he kissed girls and spent time at the Big Boy and *BEGIN SPOILER* he was able to stand on the back of the pickup truck with Patrick blaring the music as he went through the tunnel with the city and all of its lights peeking out on the other side *END SPOILER*.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigatorand Sam and Mary Elizabeth and that he was able to mail letters to his anonymous friend to help him through his first year of high school and that he was able to go to parties where he kissed girls and spent time at the Big Boy and *BEGIN SPOILER* he was able to stand on the back of the pickup truck with Patrick blaring the music as he went through the tunnel with the city and all of its lights peeking out on the other side *END SPOILER*.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is so easy! All you do is set the alarm for as many days as you want and your done. Unlike normal alarms it doesn't go off at the same time every day so you won't accidentally wake up at 6:00am on Saturday morning! I definitely suggest you  get this app!
B002JODUI4|4.0|This album has two tracks that deserve your attention: The 16th Hour and Strobe.  If you listen to these tracks and close your eyes and don't have a waking dream its because you are already between the here and the ever after.  I had my parole officer's grandmother listen to The 16th Hour three times in a row and it cured her Alzheimers.  Short take: some of these tracks have medicinal qualities, the others are insulting.  Deadmau5 still gets 4 stars for making something that no one else makes.
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|The Tedeschi Trucks Band new album Made up Mind shows how tide is the band right now, you can feel it and hear it.. amazing album. Just I wish that Mike Mattison would had sing more lead, I miss his great voice, or at least doing duets with Susan.  Anyway a great album.

B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|You can choose several different ways to play this game. The one that I have been using is called &#34;Zen.&#34; In that portion, there is no end .. ever! When you turn the game off and then return, it conyinues where you left off. If you wish you can tell the game that you want to begin a new game and you are warned that your progress will be 'overwritten.'<br /><br />I have been known to start playing this game and only stop when I get the message that the battery is getting low.
B000083C49|5.0|One of the Treck'ies better movies... and good for any age group.  I've given all kinds of copies away. Thank you.

0316069884|5.0|I have read many books making compelling arguments against eating meat, but I have to say that this remarkable book has changed me for good. I recently read the China study and that too is a fabulous well researched book about how eating a whole food plant based diet is the best way to keep us healthy and living long.  That book alone had already motivated me to eat a lot less meat and dairy but I was still getting tempted to eat the occasional piece of meat because it is so darn tasty!  One of the most thought provoking questions that Jonathan writes in his book is this:  What will you do when you know the truth about eating animals?  Well, for me, there absolutely no way, that I could ever eat meat again. I cried through most of the book because of the clear factual descriptions of the process the animals go through for us to get our tasty hamburger.  Now when I look at a chicken leg on someones plate, I can't help but think that it is tortured flesh.  I was thinking that I was going to still eat dairy, but the animals that are producing the butter, cheese and milk that we want, will also eventually get slaughtered.  So, in good conscious, I will no longer be able to eat those products as well.  This is a well researched book that will change the way you think about food forever.  Be warned, once you read this book, it is very unlikely you'll be able to eat any kind of animal or product that comes from an animal again.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is an interesting puzzle game. There are two 'beads' of each color and the object is to connect those two beads and thus fill the screen. The first are quite easy and become more difficult as time goes on. In the initial 'set' there are 150 puzzles, and I have not completed those yet, so I cannot speak about the others that are listed, but I like the relaxing play and end of the day wind down.
B000I3R796|3.0|The acting was decent.  The story was decent.  The set design and costumes were cool.  The action sequences were mostly okay but sometimes weird.  It seems like the director wasn't the right choice for this project because it just didn't work, despite good working parts.

B007TKT2SK|3.0|This is an useful tool for persons working with fractions. However, is a basic calculator, so there should be not too bigh expectations. Most of the minuses described by other users are real challenges such as the lack of decimal point. You can overcome that by becoming an expert in decimal equivalents. In addition, some of the results are expressed in such fractions VERY impractical to 'represent with a regular tape such as 21/64; 29/32, etc.<br />A dressmaker/ pattern maker will be familiar with fractions of up to 32 in the denominator, but rather work with the closest fraction over  &quot;8&quot; .<br />The app is a good tool even after discounting the need to access the internet and the space in HD used.<br />I would recommend it to my friends advising them off all of the above.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I havent heard of this game but i find it a lot of fun.  Once you start playing it is hard to stop playing.

B009AP2G26|5.0|I am a huge Glee fan - total guilty pleasure.  I had fallen behind in watching last season's episodes, though, and with the unfortunate death of Cory Monteith (Finn), I decided I'd better catch up before the season premiere.  I know the cast is older than the characters they portray, but the are a talented group of young people with some really great writers behind their scripts.  Continuing to love me some Glee!  So sorry for the loss to the cast, crew, family and friends of Cory.  He will be missed.
B00E193TM2|3.0|I'll keep this quick and simple.<br /><br />The album is undeniably heavy in its song/chord progression and the mixing adds much of the hard-hitting \\"oomph\\" I've always enjoyed about this band's particular brand of music.<br /><br />I was hoping that FFDP would've matured a bit since I'd last heard them; unfortunately, lyrically, this album fails to get past its own angst and hangs itself before it can even start.<br /><br />I've been a metal head since I could operate a cassette deck, and for the most part the content of most metal can be ignored in lieu of superior musicianship.  However this mix really puts Ivan's vocals up front and \\"in your face\\", certainly as they should; the guy has sounded great since Motograter - but because of this you can't escape the somewhat immature lyrical content.<br /><br />It's not all bad on the lyrical front however, but I can't shake the feeling like I've done this before. If you aren't a diehard fan of FFDP, or have 'liked' some of thier material before I doubt this will swing you into a purchase.<br /><br />Not bad, but painful for metal heads such as myself as it feels like a loss; good music in poor taste.

B00CFYAT6O|5.0|What a great CD!  I am a huge Tedeschi Trucks fan, and have been eagerly awaiting the release of this CD.  And wow, it does not disappoint!  The entire CD is fantastic--have listened to it 10 times in 24 hours, and I'm still amazed.  If you are a blues fan, you love (obviously) great guitar talent and beautiful smoky, blues-y vocals, you will LOVE this CD.  TTB just keeps getting better!!

B00884GR0W|4.0|I like the  game but it is very hard to just build a house. Plus it is very glitchey. water animations are not the best. But good game overall.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|A skillful space-faring overdose of adrenaline, if not really my idea of a Star Trek film. Into Darkness has the makings of a curvy, complicated red tape thriller, but its predictability, superficiality and outright refusal to go more than five minutes between jump-cut-loaded action scenes halts the germination of that seed relatively early. With the exception of big-bad Benedict Cumberbatch, who manages to be both admirable and despicable in even doses, the film is thoroughly overacted and the touches of fan service that I so relished in the 2009 reboot seem far more forced and unnecessary the second time around. There's also a notable lack of gravitas to the proceedings, in my opinion one of the hallmarks of the series, with an unfamiliar trigger-happy temperament lending the impression of an adult who's regressed into a period of renewed adolescence. That's not to say it isn't enjoyable: the action sets, though frequent, are constantly fresh and exciting, while its daring in even-handedly tackling the subject of a 23rd century terrorist is progressive and topical. I merely found myself wishing for a bit more meat and a smaller serving of kicks, punches and phasers.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I have enjoyed the previous books of the Khaled Hosseini but this one didn't blow me away as the others. In fact it was quite confusing, too many stories with bot much purpose to the ending....

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Great use of the language on the sense the is elegant, instructive and the writing suggests the sort of speaking of the characters in a very imaginative form. I would recommend this book to everyone. Very entertaining.
1402785305|5.0|I ordered the Classic Lines cover for Pride and Prejudice and it is so pretty! I had never read the book before (the famous first sentence was never very appealing for me) and I loved it. The dad was so awesome - he was one of my favorite characters.

B008JFUPK8|1.0|Man of Steel, an interesting enough title, with an ensemble cast, and a great director, what could go wrong?  It seems that Snyder and Nolan watched the Transformers trilogy and decided to use that for a basis of a movie.  Man of Steel delivers all it can with a choppy script and overuse of action.  If you plan on seeing this movie expecting to see a hero you won't.  Henry Cavill is almost as boring as the title sequence in the Christopher Reeves Superman.  Amy Adams left me hating Lois Lane, but not as much as I now hate Perry White.  Michael Shannon gave his best performance, but it was hardly memorable.  You know a film is damned to fail if Russel Crowe is the most captivating actor.  And now the sequel will be sodomizing Batman also?  Oh well, I guess this is a sign to give up on Supes.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|excellent game for the brain. makes u stop and think about u need to do next so u can get to the next level
193700788X|1.0|It was just a lack luster story and crap ending to what started out to be a fantastic series.  The authors characters lost their spark and took on different attributes in the final book.  Charlene turned Eric into a spineless, pathetic, shell of what he was.  It seem as if Sookie was settling in the end with who she ended up with.  There was no fire or passion between them.  Even their one love encountered was completely lame and utterly boring.  There could have been way more build up and romance in the final 2 or 3 books.  The way it was written, and how the characters personalities became altered, made it seem as if the book was written by someone else.  It was a complete disappointment.<br /><br />Charlene, you cannot please everyone but this book just seemed like you were \\"phoning it in\\" as they say.  It appears that writing the Sookie books became a pay check to you and not a passion.  I guess you figured your loyal readers would buy whatever crap you slapped together, which we did because we trusted you.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Takes my time...takes my mental abilities to the limit. Love the game. I play everyday and cannot wait to play again. Wish we had more FREE helps!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After my Logitech G5's scroll wheel gave out after many years of use and abuse, I ordered this mouse based on Amazon customer ratings.  Good call, guys!<br /><br />Although I was worried about the form factor and build quality, I actually find this mouse more comfortable than the G5.  And the side buttons are probably even more ergonomic than the G5's.<br /><br />The mouse driver/configuration software is easy to use and fairly powerful. I was never one to want lots of buttons on my mouse, but now that I have so many, I'm putting them to good use even on the desktop and web browser, speeding up navigation quite a bit and requiring less movement and clicks.<br /><br />The one caveat I have is that the weights are held by a piece of foam with holes rather than a cartridge.  I have had no problems with it so far but am wondering how this will hold up (heh) over time.<br /><br />All in all, the mouse feels solid and has performed flawlessly - I don't miss my old mouse one bit.  Definitely a good value for those who want a great mouse at an affordable price.

B00AFQC4QC|3.0|Beginning in Bratislava in 1933, this story of historical fiction follows various civilians through the lead-up, duration, and aftermath of World War II. Focusing on individuals in Slovakia the reader is taken on a long-winded, albeit at times fascinating, tour of an often-neglected portion of this most infamous of wars.<br /><br />In the middle of it all is gentle Greta, a voracious reader from a Jewish family who finds herself in love with a \\"Prussian looking junior sales assistant\\" at the local bookstore. Little does Greta know that a wave of anti-Semitism will make her eventual marriage to this non-Jewish man a potentially lethal situation for both husband and wife. Unlike his daughter, Greta's father Jonah has always exercised more caution in matters concerning his Jewish heritage. As a skilled weaver Jonah has always kept himself from being too closely associated with the Jewish community, never wanting to \\"attract unwanted attention and damage his business\\". Of course nothing can fully protect these and others from the sheer insanity that came with the rise and fall of Nazi Europe.<br /><br />Lingering not just on those persecuted by the wave of anti-Semitism but on the bystanders, the sympathizers, and the opportunists as well, the book does an excellent job of providing insight into how regular people could be swept up in the constant barrage of Nazi propaganda. As Greta's own husband remarks after Greta suffers a miscarriage \\"Did she really work too hard or was that her weak Jewish body that made the baby come away? I do wonder.\\" And characters often wonder, fear, plot, and die. As attitudes shift with whoever is winning the war, it becomes clear that no one was ever truly safe at this time no matter what their allegiance or background.<br /><br />What detracts from this story of historical terror is an overall slow pacing. Greta's initial courtship is neither very intriguing (\\"[Greta's future husband] respected her and found her ideas on literature very impressive but in his relationship with her his physical needs became soon the most important factor.\\") nor is it very swift. As ripe for conflict as a marriage of mixed faiths is in 1930's Europe, it does not provide enough creative power to grab the reader's attention nor do lengthy explanations of Greta and her husband's respective backgrounds. Likewise, portions of clunky dialogue only distract from establishing more well-rounded and memorable individuals. As one character says of a Countess who enjoys Jonah's work, \\"The Countess enjoys a philosophical debate about the human condition and loves nothing more than hearing a new perspective and a fresh reflection on her own thoughts on the matter.\\"<br /><br />Though THE LUCK OF THE WEISSENSTEINERS succeeds in shedding light on an overlooked aspect of World War II (i.e. life in Slovakia), it often suffers from a blunt sluggishness. For dedicated readers, the historical aspects of many of the characters will prove fascinating even if the characters themselves do not.<br /><br />Reviewed by Collin Marchiando for IndieReader.mpressive but in his relationship with her his physical needs became soon the most important factor.\\") nor is it very swift.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest, but the app is not working anymore on my kindle fire. I have had to reinstall this app a lot. I wish I could still use the app. :(
B00B4804KS|5.0|This movie was so perfectly converted to 3D it seemed to have been shot with that in mind.  The image quality is exceptional as well.<br />Great job all around.
B007UXT6T6|3.0|Predictable. Slow paced. Stunts are some what new but it seems to be the same basic plot as the others in the series.
B001EBWING|5.0|This is an absolute masterpiece that I have been meaning to see for quite some time. It is an excellent example of what Hollywood and America was at that time of rugged, individual men that did anything for the women that they loved even if it meant sacrificing their fantasies and desires.  I can also see why Bogart is considered the no. 1 man actor in American cinema.  He exemplifies American culture, confidence, and bravado that most men back then and now wish they could have that kind of persona.  It is only a shame that one knows that such films will probably never be made again.  One there are no such male actors that are 1/4 the man of Bogart and all the modern actresses cannot match Ingred Bergman's natural beauty and most of them are tramps as well.  Not to mention the sets, music and singing.  Quite an amazing film.  I heavily encourage everyone to watch this film
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Once again, couldn't wait for the next installment.  EVERY character is sooo intriguing.  Have see 3 and it is a real boohoo.  Can't believe Matthew is dead---what were they thinking?
B0057LUI0O|5.0|We love this movie as a family but it has been a hit for the kids. They have been watching this over and over again and now they are dancing to it while watching it. The music is wonderful... It is fun, heart warming, nice relaxing movie. Great for weekend family movie time.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Read the whole thing in one sitting. I haven't been this moved by a book in a very long time! First and only time I've ever reviewed a book, but this one deserves it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Be ready to face suspense, the games, and more. Don't miss it. It's cooler than the first one. Hugs! Kiss
B004I744AS|5.0|Very helpful to beat the fifth level of lego batman the video game to beat the fifth level of lego the world books that are in the world is not the fifth of lego star wars episode of a better Christian even if you are in frosted flakes and I have yourself .
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the game it is fun,fast, and cool the one problem is it should have costumes you can ALWAYS buy it is a good game
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I have had this app for a while and I keep playing it.  It is very entertaining, I like all the stages, and collecting, just keep playing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and can be played by people of all ages. Be careful because it is easy to get caught up playing.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Great game you can customize your character and fight and train with him<br />It gets harder and but not way to hard<br />Also the controls are simple<br />Now it says 2.99 for it but I got it for free<br />The only thing is that says that I need to be connected to the same internet connection as someone else to play against someone online but still a 5 star game
B008JFUR10|4.0|Ok, the special effects are really cool (can't wait to see them in HD). But what you might actually want to know is: Is the plot any good??? the answer is YES. It is very simple but well put together with a lot of action scenes. The result is an entertaining movie to enjoy on a big screen TV. If by any chance you are an anime fan, then is a must just for the robots Vs. monsters scenes.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Love the original series.  I grew up on this stuff.  Brings back fond memories.  Anyone who loves Star Trek has to love the original season.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I really like the app for my kindle.  I gives me notifications, it's very easy to use, and works every time.  No bugs!
0920668364|5.0|I love reading it to my baby, the only downside is that it's so darn catchy that it gets stuck in your head and you find yourself mumbling it, thinking about it, or reciting it at odd times (like at the dentist, or in traffic, etc).  I highly recommend going to the author's website and reading the story behind his writing the book and maybe even listening to him read it aloud - although, if you have your own melody that you sing the little song to, you might not want to do this, because his melody somehow usurped the one I had been using and now I can't recall the melody I had been using.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|What I liked about this book is that it held you in suspense and so many thrills. I would recommend  this book for ages 12+. I rated this book  5 stars because how the characters are so easy to visualise and you can feel everything they feel.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Still a great app as a whole, but compared to the iPhone/iPad app, the UI feels a little clunky. Would like more function buttons (like trash) and swipe functions in snippet view.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've been playing almost constantly since I downloaded this app a few days ago. It does have adds, but they are easy to skip, so they haven't been a bother.  I haven't noticed any glitches or any other problems.  Also, if you go into the settings, you can customize the card backs and the background using your own photos.  Both spider solitaire and the standard version by MobilityWare are great apps.  Highly recommend!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This is such a great movie.  The story is great, the acting is great, and the director keeps the story moving, and the twists and turns are awesome.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like to play Mahjong.  It sometimes is harder than others, but fun to try to beat.  I enjoy this game.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Thiw wasd a fascinating read. If you would like to know more about the art of manipulating your surroundings this book is a must read. I found it interesting and inspiring to be drawn into this wicked mind that orchestrates each and everyone and creates a scanario and calling it 'the truth'.
B009LDCXNY|1.0|I found season 8 to be the worst written season of this show. New show runner Jeremy Carver managed to take a fun, creepy exciting horror show and turn it into contrived melo-drama. There were a few good parts introduced such as the character of Benny and the Men of Letters storyline but Benny ended up being a plot device to create unneeded tension between the brothers and the MoL was never explored beyond the bunker set. Most of the characters were written completely out of character, established mythology was either forgotten or simply ignored, and episodes were contrived to artificially create drama instead of letting drama unfold from the situation. There was even an entire angel storyline that didn't have anything to do with the Winchesters at all. Season 8 managed to do what I thought could never be done -- completely kill my passion for my favorite show. This will be the only season of Supernatural I won't own on DVD simply because I can't bring myself to watch any of it again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome simple fun.  Very challenging and great selection of different vehicles to play.  Interesting variety of maps to test your skills.

B00002SSKI|1.0|The movie skipped did not get to watch any of it been looking for this movie for my child to watch as it was my favorite when i was a kid. :(
B00ALCBTWU|1.0|This is a pretty mindless film - the historical inaccuracies in equipment are glaring for any shooter/collector of military rifles. In one scene I spotted both protaganist U.S soldiers firing No4 Mk1 Lee Enfields - British rifles for those ignorant to these details. These soldiers ought to be using Garands or Springfields. Add to that the fact that the U.S sniper has a rifle with a modern after market no drill/tap scope mount, and I suspect that the scope itself is not even correct for that rifle!<br /><br />As others have said, what starts off with some promise soon becomes a dumbed down mess - with German soldiers no smarter than rocks. Every U.S bullet hits its mark, near every German bullet misses or goes astray despite overwhelming forepower! I am actually surprised Steven Seagal was not cast in this, it has that kind of idiotic flavour. I have actually stopped this film half way through to write this review I was so irked by it and I will now return to the DVD player and hit eject, in the comfort of knowing that the rest of the film was pretty much a downhill ride from where I am at now. Don't bother ... unless you're 10 years old.
B00005V9HA|2.0|When this movie came out, I was very young and liked movies like this, but this is totally unreal and stupid. It might be some ppeople movie if your totally into gore, and zombies. This is not a horror film like Friday the 13th/Halloween/Serpent and the Rainbow. This movie is on the B list and to me barely at that, I'm just glad I can trade this in or pawn it off to somebody who likes movies like this. If you like the funny, horror type films, go ahead check it out. It's just not my cup of tea, the scarier, and those that seem like they could happen are the true horror movies I like.<br /><br />Kris L. CocKayne
B004G6TCIA|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Emerson Lake & Palmer for more years than I care to admit.  I've always liked the Tarkus album and had to have it on CD.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|A great lazy Sunday movie, very funny, would highly recommend it.  Not sure if it is worth buying but definitely worth the rental.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is challenging enough to keep your interest but not so much that it totally frustrates you. It does what it promises.  It would be more fun without all the ads but to be free, you gotta pay somehow.<br /> Enjoy!

B00125JP1C|5.0|A very dark but funny almost cartoonish movie with an outstanding cast, lots of snappy dialogue and incredible stunts.  One of my favorite movies.
6301599411|5.0|GLAD TO HAVE THIS BACK AGAIN---FASCINATING INFO AND PICTURES.  THIRD TIME I HAVE BOUGHT VIDEO AND BOOK . THIS COPY WILL NBOT BE LOANED OUT!!!
B00CCFZO6Q|5.0|This is a fantastic album that is an album in the truest, old-school sense. There is a consistent , but dynamic , feel as the album progresses from start to finish. I believe that the band approaches this effort with a significant amount of focus and creativity, and I highly recommend their finished product.
B000J670ZI|5.0|I laughed so hard I had to pause the movie, twice, just to let it all out. Hepburn was just amazing! This movie really brightened up a bad day.

B00AHHODH2|1.0|I rarely never finish reading a book but this one was easy to put down. The characters were superficial with few redeeming qualities. I just didn't care what happens to them
B008JF8O9M|4.0|I have found this to be a pretty good print program. At first I wasn't so sure but after a few minutes I had it down as a science. I do recommend this program.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Got this app today. Guaranteed fun and learning each time when downloading from 22Learn. Well designed apps with plenty of replay value, colorful and engaging images and sounds.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Unfamiliar with the author's style, it took 2 or 3 chapters for me to get into the story, but once I did, I was hooked.  It was fascinating to watch how the author wove the story through the different branches of the family.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.  I can hardly wait for the author's next novel.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I really like this game one of the best apps I ever played. The customizing is AWESOME well now time to play it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play every day. Absolutely love it. No Bingo coins? Play the free tournament. Lots of coins? Play in the slot rooms!  Love it!!!
B009LQKHIO|1.0|I do enjoyed the plot and the characters involved! Just good , easy reading! Waiting expectantly to read the next book in the series!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Since I have read several books since reading The Kitchen House, I cannot give a fair review. I do know that after I read it, I reccommended it to several of my good friends. It's a good read.
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|This game would be a great game if it wouldn't crash about every 10 - 15 minutes. I have to reboot my device since it freezes the device up. It goes back to the last successful save, so no progress is made. Very frustrating. So, I'm removing it. Maybe they will come up with an update to version 1.05. Happily giving the 1 star that is the minimum allowed for the concept alone. But it needs work. Samsung Galaxy Media Player 4.
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|What other band 'from the 90's' encompasses such a vast sonic astral plane?  Goth meets country meets metal meets shoegazer meets emo meets pop meets lullaby meets rock meets The Future Embrace? These reissues are must buy and Candy for the Ears.  Nuff Said.
B006Z21ZGK|4.0|I liked this blu-ray the best compared to other Iron Maiden concerts I've watched on disk.  I saw the Final Frontier Tour in San Antonio, so this disk brings back the memories.  Overall good video footage and sound quality.  The material in the extras section is good as well.  Too bad they didn't produce a video for their last tour, so this will have to do.  Recommended if you're an Maiden fan.
159420411X|4.0|It's a good book!it explains everthing!i recommend this to everyone the only thing is that some parts of the book are not that good
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|The first sentence of SEBASTIAN stirred my curiosity, and like Alice, I found myself in another time and place. Transported to a hospital room in pre-WWI Vienna, I felt the gravity of the situation. Was this doctor really going to amputate part of Sebastian's leg? Carried along from page to page, I worried alongside his mother, Vera, and wondered why his father, Franz, was not there.<br /><br />As the novel unfolds and expands, we experience everyday life in this era. Vienna, in the years just before the Great War, was in a sort of golden age bubble --- a bubble that was about to burst. The trajectory of Sebastian's life will change, as will the lives of the other characters we meet, all tied in one way or another to the family's grocery store, a gathering place of many ethnicities.<br /><br />The author, Christophe Fischer, is a very talented writer. His first book, THE LUCK OF THE WEISSENSTEINERS, was a fabulous read, too. I think the writing in SEBASTIAN is even more graceful and the history so smoothly integrated. Oh, how deftly the author laces the metaphorical shoe that Sebastian will no longer wear. Everyone is missing a shoe of one kind or another. Sebastian's journey is everyone's journey.<br /><br />Who will love this novel? Anyone who values good storytelling, a well researched setting, and a cast of fascinating characters --- each with their own challenges. The novel holds our attention, so rapt we are in how people adapt, well or not, to changing landscapes in their lives, their decisions often based on their perceptions, accurate or not. SEBASTIAN is superb historical fiction. Highly recommended.

B004AQR29C|5.0|This movie has plenty of action. It is easy to follow the plot and has several well known actors. This movie can be a little too gory for young children. A lot of violence, shooting, and blood.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I loved this biography of Jobs.  I never realized how influential he was in developing all of the technology we use today.

Its a bloody weather app not a game!<br /><br />To the guys who made this app please change it back it was so much better before.
1439156816|5.0|This is undoubtedly THE best book on writing I have on my shelf . . . and I have way too many!  I laughed out loud on almost every page.  I've recommended this book to everyone I know, whether they have an interest in writing or not.  I plan to read it cover to cover at least 10 times.  Thank you, Stephen King!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I am having a hard time finishing this book.  I find it to be abnormally kinky.  I think the woman in the book is at weird as he is.  Christian had a very bad beginning of his life.  At this point at chapter five this is what I get from the book.

B000ICXQXI|5.0|I was over at my friend's house looking through movies to watch and I suggested Psycho! We had never seen it before but it was one of her mother's, who ended up joining to watch the film, favorite films. Psycho (1960) is a movie with a huge legacy and tends to get brought up in the movie world often. As a movie lover, this was on my list to watch for a long time!<br /><br />The film starts out with Marion Crane, a young and beautiful women, longing to be married to her boyfriend Sam Loomis. This involves a steamy bedroom scene that caused controversy for the time this movie was created. In order to get money for a marriage, she steals $40,000 from a client at her job in a realtor's office. What does she do after this? Run from town, of course! This part of the movie starts off a little slow and actually even bored my friend a little. Eventually, Marion ends up at Bates Motel where she meets Norman Bates who owns the motel with his mother who lives next door in an old home. He invites Marion to eat sandwiches with him in the motel parlor and as he talks about himself there are sure vibes that something is just off. Your mind will begin to question his sanity. From here on, the movie is full of excitement that I would not want to spoil. You will be on the edge of your seat wondering what is going on and what can be psychologically wrong with someone in the world to do and think these things.<br /><br />While the movie is outdated in the sense that you will not be screaming in fear, I found myself tense up a bit some scenes and very disturbed by many of the scenes. The concepts and mental illness in this film are interesting and something you might be encouraged to learn about after it is over! Also, I had nightmares a few nights after watching this. It seemed to stay printed in my mind for a while. In conclusion, this is a very well put together film and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good mind game.<br /><br />Also, some interesting facts!<br />This was the first mainstream movie to show a flushing toilet.<br />Alfred Hitchcock, the director and producer, insisted that their be a \\"no late policy\\" for Psycho's showing at the theaters because of a early death of a main character! He also demanded that critics watch this movie with the regular audience for the full effect and that no secrets surrounding the film would be spoiled.<br />And finally, this movie was nominated for 4 Academy Awards!the first mainstream movie to show a flushing toilet.<br />Alfred Hitchcock, the director and producer, insisted that their be a \\"no late policy\\" for Psycho's showing at the theaters because of a early death of a main character!

0316017930|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyable.  Mr. Gladwell has such an interesting spark of curiosity, and I am so happy that he shares it with the world.
B00136JS12|4.0|I loved this album the first time I heard it, 30 years ago, and it's still a classic!<br />The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is the somewhat sex and drug related lyrics - too much for my taste.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This yet another game that is good enough that is just hard to put down. The different levels and vehicle keep it fresh and exciting.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|i really like this dress up game because it really does give you more options then most. which makes it lots of fun.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|It's Nick Cave. Even when he's bad, or just mediocre, he's good (god). Overlooking Grinderman, of course. Menopause isn't pretty in women or men.
B00AG475K8|5.0|Tear jerker but an amazing movie. Will watch this one many many times. Great actors with a great story line.
1476733953|4.0|\\"Wool\\" by Hugh Howey is set in a future dystopia, reminded me of the \\"Hunger Games,\\" but was much better written than that series. From what I understand this book was first posted online chapter by chapter from the author. And Mr. Howey gained input from readers while he was writing. In reading the story you can tell this was the case, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think it added unnecessary length to the story. I enjoyed most of the book. The characters were written well and the description of the Silo world was as well. There was a point in the story where I thought it was unbelievable, but I don't want to spoil anything so I'll let you judge for yourself.  Overall, I'd recommend this book!
B0007LGCB8|5.0|Long feels the hour it's been that I sought after a shoe worthy of a manly foot. The Keen utility sandal fulfills the need for comfort as well as rugged gentlemanly class. I now in my possession own Topsiders, as well as the Keens. I no longer require socks, and with that being said my feet are finally free from the cotton prison that once held them dire captive.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|How can you not love her? I hate authors who build on others worlds, but, it's P.D. James. She only adds to the awesomeness of Jane Austen. It's beyond fanfic, and treads new but familiar territory. No one is out of character, and is believable based on Austen's writings.

B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I love this game. It's so easy to take it along on my Kindle. I have to schedule time to play or nothing else gets done. Very addictive. I highly recommend this game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really love this game.  I've got all the different Quell games and I enjoy them all. Great music accomplices the various levels adding to the fun
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|All the characters in this story became so real. The author makes  the people in the story seem like people you could live right next door too. Usually with lots of different characters I have a favorite and can't wait to get back to them. Not so with this very cleverly written novel. I was so interested in all of the characters! I could not put this book down. The way that Liane Moriarty puts this story all together and wraps the story around your heart, you will laugh, you will cry, you will feel each character's pain and grief. I loved this book!
B000065V3H|5.0|This movie makes me laugh everytime I watch it I loved it the first time when it first came out and still to this day.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I like the sound effects and puzzles that needed to be completed to continue the game. It makes you feel a bit creeped out.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It's convoluted, but truly shows the culture so unlike ours. We must learn to understand where they are coming from.

B00CL6GAD2|5.0|I never even heard about this movie until I saw it on demand; and since I'm a fan of both Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe, I figured I couldn't go wrong. I was right! It was a nice surprise to come across this suspenseful flick.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I hade trouble down loading it and have not yet been able to play it.  Cannot honestly rate it till after I have played it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Enjoyed your book immensely! Informative and a little maddening to find out some of the underhanded methods that Edison resorted to. Would like to know why there are no references? No citations?  I think that would lend more credibility to your facts, for those readers who are unfamiliar with your subject and may stumble at the example of Tesla if it is completely new to them. The May not then go easily into your ideas of genius and imagination. Other than that, I loved the book and have already been talking about it. I plan on lending my copy.
B00005R5G9|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made!!!!!!! I could watch it over and over. Must see for the ladies that like romantic comedies.

B00DH1G7DS|3.0|Has a nice feature where when you input the correct number it deletes that number from that row and column.
B008PZZV8S|4.0|A bizarre and dark tale of a strange person being paid to convince a wealthy heir to return from Italy. With Matt D turning in a multi-personality performance
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|This book has been comprehensively reviewed on Amazon already, so all I'll say is that it's easily one of King's best ever, ranking alongside the brilliant 'Salem's Lot, The Green Mile, Pet Sematary and The Shining. Yes, I'm  a huge King fan, definitely. When Stephen King is on form, as he is in this book, you have a hard time closing it and putting it down. Highly recommended!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Lets get the obvious out the way, for the price your not getting a diamond grit Grade A razor sharpening tool.<br /><br />What you are getting is a compact, very affordable, easy to use sharpener. It's got carbide teeth to cut down the blade, Ceramic to sharpen the edge finer, and then a diamond rod that i use for serrated edges and brushing bur off the edge.<br /><br />Overall, it wont get your blades sharp enough to shave hair, but it will get them acceptable. Great little cheap product to keep around in your pocket, bug out bag, EDC bag, INCH bag, WROL kits, Hiking packs, etc.<br /><br />Overall, i think it is well worth the money and little bit of shipping. if youve got the spare cash, youll get well over your money's worth.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was looking for a nice camera bag that could carry all of my lenses and accessories. This was it for an affordable price. I love it!!!! Thanks Amazon.
B00BPXAQQO|3.0|Thought these figurines would be something special for my girls birthday present. WRONG. We purchased Tinkerbell figurines around Christmas time that were of the same quality and half the price from Target. My daughter was more than happy with them, but at 3 years old, she did not have to buy them. Stay away if you are budget minded folks as you will get little for lot$.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|I meant someone on here and it's a legit website kind of like an EHarmony for 20 year olds... I like that if you don't want to respond you can just say not interested and also it monitors who looking at you and interested.
B000002UZ4|4.0|If you really like the Pet Shop Boys, Buy It. there are some great songs on here. If you are a really big PSB fan, you will love it.
B00DCX08MW|1.0|This game is terrible and i cant beat the second level. Do not get this game even if it is free.
B00DU73T08|4.0|I about didn't watch it because of others ratings. I'm glad I did.  It was entertaining and thought provoking although some of the acting was not the best.
B005KJ6ECY|1.0|well the seller did not expose the fact that you need a VCR that was zoned for Europe.  The discs would not run on my VCR  because I have one zoned for the US.  Had to return the product
B0043URV5U|5.0|This is an amazing collection of songs that cover a great span of Rock and Roll. This is a MUST HAVE in any music collection.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|Beyonce has always catered to her fans by releasing a new dvd every couple years. Each one is outstanding and worth checking out if you're a fan, but this performance has to be, in my opinion, the best of the bunch. This is Beyonce in full gear. It felt like it was never going to end, but that is not a complaint. If you want to watch a true entertainer put on a real show, then Beyonce is the Diva for you.
B0083VP2KQ|5.0|This is the most impressive BBC Discovery CD on dinosaurs that lived in the mid-Cretaceous period, such as Spinosaurus and other large predators that were larger than T-Rex. I have never seen a show with almost brought to life these magnificent animals that are now extinct. They were most impressive. This video also shows factual information instead of assumptions about how these animals lived and what they are by evidence found in fossil records, and shows a clear predator/prey relationship with recent discoveries. I learned alot about Spinosaurus and that is mostly ate large sawfish that were very abundant during this period in our Earth's history. I give this video 5 Stars along with most of the BBC Discovery videos such as Walking With Dinosaurs, which I also rated 5 Stars. Very good learning videos to learn about these magnificant animals and how predators could co-exist in the same area.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|I am picky about the simulators out there but l am playing this every day! Get this app  no matter what price it is!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Another quick, fun game we added to our game night when there is not enough time to play most of our other games.  You will learn how ghoulish your friends are when you hear them say &#34;bbrraaiiinnssss....&#34;
0811836363|5.0|There isn't much I can say other than, this is an amazing book. If you are in any way interested by the Beatles, then you've got to check this out. It's worth every penny. It's basically an encyclopedia of the band compiled by the guys themselves.

B001974DG0|5.0|If you weren't a dog lover before reading this book you will be afterwards. You can't help, but fall in love with Einstein. Dean Koontz does such a great job of bringing characters from obscure parts of life an develop them into great heroes. It reminds me that everyone has the potential to rise to greatness and that there exist inner strengths that surface in times of need. Great book!
B00C04H2VO|5.0|I bought these for cake toppers. Wonderful and a huge hit for the despicable me fans!!! Kids went nuts and they all were able to choose one to take home. Great price for the package as they are expensive if bought separately. Fast ship and were packaged perfectly.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I really enjoy playing dis game. Very addictive, you have to scratch off daily to win tokens...but it's worth it. And to top it off its FREE!!!!!!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Extraordinary and ordinary characters draw you into the the struggle to survive. A foreshadowing of the power of the net in the right hands, and the possibility of interstellar conflict because of nothing more than different ways of thinking.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Great formatting information. Helpful for publishing with Amazon. Wish it had a little more info regaurding inserted photos as well as a couple more things.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Couldn't put it down once I started reading. Some very funny lines.<br />A good rainy day book to curl yup with.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Simply doing the idea machine alone will change your life. As a writer, it's given me so many fresh ideas to pursue that I couldn't honestly put a price on how valuable that idea was.<br /><br />There are hundreds more in the book. Get it and use it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I didn't actually get to play it because it took forever to load so I just deleted it. even so I'm sure it would've been terrible
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The best knife I own. Handle is ergonomic and with one layer of paracord wrapped around it, gives the perfect grip. The blade itself was razor sharp out of the box and stayed sharp when I used it during an overnight camp. The sheath is a topic of discussion on many sites for its floppy belt loop, but I think its perfect as it is made to hang from your belt and be strapped around the thigh. I wear it that way and it doesn't flop around. Weight of the BK2 is not an issue for me as it gives an impression of its strength and reliability. I love this knife.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time, I fell in love with all of the help.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Good character development. Well paced plot lines. Obviously written for a younger tween readers but still entertaining adventures and solid writing make for a quick read.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A beautiful and different story. It is about many things - magic, competition, friendship, betrayal, history, art, fashion, architecture, clockwork.  But above all it is a love story, as the best always are.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this and u never get tired of it. Temple run is now boring and this is hot!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Awesome book. Tells about the wonder of being deformed but Getting along with everything. Really deserves 10 stars.<br />(Or infinity)
B00422LESO|4.0|A sweet book for someone who loves P and P.  Delightful and so easy to enjoy.  It makes me want to read more of this author's books.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I liked the story line of starting a business and the hopefulness of making a go of it.  Helping others succeed made the book worthwhile for the time. I would recommend the book to other friends who like to read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|So addicting, no complaints what so ever. I play every day. It is so fun. I love this game. I don't play alot of app games but this one is a keeper.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|Although I'm late, but I enjoyed all 8 seasons of 24. The thrill and excitation never stopped... Chloe now... She is just amazing and a true friend to Jack. Their strong relationship\bond made me cry at the end... I would totally recommend anyone to watch 24. When there is nothing else on tv, no other shows to catch up on, on your day off, a long boring weekend? Make these moments worthwhile by registering to Amazon Prime and watching 24***
B005HV6Y84|3.0|The cd once again was just like new for half the price.  I was how ever not to happy with the long time it took to get it.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Have listened to this CD every day since i received it. Stellar performances by Beth and Joe. It just doesn't get any better than this. I'd Rather Go Blind is spellbinding to me.
B004H4XLRE|5.0|Thank you my son has impressed so much he is excited and play all day I'm so happy I'll be back to buy again
B000P407K4|1.0|Looking for comedy and seeing the great rating the movie gets everywhere, I expected to be entertained... I wasn't.  There are very few comedic moments to it, and for those that are there, the humor is weak and accompanied with many minutes of dragging scenes.  When I watch old movie (and I've seen plenty) I try to give them some leeway since filmography was young, technology was limited, and budgets were narrow, but this movie fails to entertain me in the slightest.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This was a great movie. I don't usually like these type of action movies, but it was really good. Ladies, you won't be disappointed if your guy chooses this one for movie night.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|AHHH SO GOOD!!!! onto book two :) Teenage girl literature for sure, but reminds me of anime and manga in context.  Love it!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|This makes corporate law look bad. Not all law firms are so cutthroat. But it is very fast paced and fun to watch.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very interesting and thought provoking science. The chance of the scientific ideas becoming truths and the explanations of the science makes it interesting to watch.
B00BZAJMWG|4.0|very good. well acted, great characters, highly entertaining. apparently I need more words in here to fill the word requirement.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|When Kelly released her breakthrough album Breakaway in 2004, she made her origin, reality competition American Idol an even bigger hit. Kelly had turned into pop's biggest star. My December was supposed to capitalize on her success and be a shameless monster hit. That, however, never happened. In fact, Kelly's popularity seemed to decline as pop music changed -as pop music does - and Idol gained an even bigger star out of Carrie Underwood. How could that happen? Was My December really that bad? No. It was Kelly's strongest artistic statement.<br /><br />My December kicks off with a bang. The imperfect, soaring &#34;Never Again,&#34; which had a successful Billboard debut at #8, (proving that it could've been a massive hit like &#34;Since U Been Gone&#34;) stands out as Kelly's angriest break-up anthem. The frustration-outlet &#34;One Minute&#34; paves its ground solidly (plus the catchy melodies don't hurt), but is outdone by its successor, &#34;Hole.&#34; &#34;Hole&#34; is a bloody, artistic outcry. &#34;I'm so far from where I need to be/I've given up on faith, on everything&#34; Kelly's singing rocks on it.<br /><br />An album highlight is the wonderful &#34;How I Feel,&#34; reminiscent of Annie Lennox's &#34;Why&#34; lyrically. Musically, it's slap-happy Pop/Rock with Kelly bitterly singing an ode to her lonely single life. &#34;I'm getting tired of believing/even sicker of pretending/that it's not so bad, just wait it out.&#34; Even better are the album's final moments - &#34;Irvine,&#34; the last track and &#34;Chivas,&#34; the hidden track that appears about 90 seconds after &#34;Irvine&#34; has faded out. &#34;Irvine&#34; is a folk ballad executed with waltz-like guitar strumming and the cry of a young woman at an extremely low point in her life. Would you imagine an artist like this would emerge out of the peppy American Idol?<br /><br />Two albums and a Greatest Hits package later, Kelly is once again on top. Out of the music she's released, this eclectic mix of Folk-Rock ballads, up-tempo Electro-Rock, and Indie-like Pop remains her most real and best.-tempo Electro-Rock, and Indie-like Pop remains her most real and best.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Hmm. I am Tom Cruise. I can ride a motor cycle. I can fly my flying machine. I can fix drones. I am pretty. Could this be anything else but a statement about Tom Cruise by Tom Cruise?<br />Premise of the movie and the scenery were interesting but everything else was lost on me.  Why did Morgan Freeman even associate himself with this one?
B00CLF80O0|3.0|Whitesnake has recently put out 3 live cd's in the last 2 years....Each has it's great parts, but not enough to make a great cd...Whitesnake has so many great songs, but they only focus on a few, and forget the rest...Since they decided to put out so many live cd's in the last 2 years I wonder why other great snake tunes were never put on to some of these discs instead of repeating basically the same tunes....This cd just did not measure up.....
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This was my first novel that I've purchased digitally.  It was a great story and really enjoyed reading it.  The digital copy was convenient and I had no problems downloading or reading it.  I'm looking forward to downloading more.  I love most of Nicholas Sparks novels and this one is no different.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fireproof Games made an awesome game! I was addicted to it and couldn't stop playing! I was shocked when I completed the he cause I thought there was gonna be more! Still an awesome game! You guys should make a part 2! Or another one related to it! Nice job, you guys!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|Wow, I've never seen a movie that shows the depth of love this one does. Watching it seems like real love. I hope I find a deep love like this shows. I know this is only a movie but it looks like real love to me. Two sexy men that can't live without each other. Hot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love the story line and characters!! Read it two times so far! Would recommend to anyone looking for a new book!
0446580848|1.0|The first warning about how awful this book is, should have come to me when I saw that the back cover contains glowing reviews of one of his previous books, The Lion. That book was a literary masterpiece compared to this. In this book, the antagonist, named with great originality as The Panther, is just an afterthought, and is a complete idiot with no tactical skills whatsoever. How he could mastermind the Cole bombing is never explained in the book. He is just there as a reason to write the book, and contributes absolutely nothing to the story. This book is just a 600+ pages vehicle for the author to spew all the John Corey witticisms that he has jotted down in his notebook over the last couple of years.<br /><br />Which brings me to the main character of the book, John Corey. This guy has become insufferable and a boor. Each and every paragraph of dialog (in some chapters, each line), has to be followed by a smart-ass comment. Not only that, the author follows up half of those comments with how funny the other characters found it, in case we had become brain-dead and our minds had gone numb. You can almost picture the author literally clapping himself on the back after he types the wisecracks. The unending, relentless, mind-numbing flow of smart-ass, racist comments have to be seen to be believed. Taking them out would have reduced 200-250 pages from the book, and made it more readable. Another wise guy from his previous books, Paul Brenner, is also present, though thankfully his wisecracking is kept to a minimum, just so that John Corey can keep on with his. All the other characters, such as john's wife Kate, are merely there as filler. As another reviewer mentioned, I fervently hoped that a missile would take out Corey so that Paul and Kate could get it on. Alas, no such luck.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I really love this game and am very addicted to it. My only complaint would be that you don't get a lot of tokens. You need 2 tokens to play a game and the only way you can get them is if you  level up, pay a ridiculous amount, or use scratch ticket every 40 mins. But that's what you get for buying a free game. But you should get this app it.is very fun and great for all ages
B00CWY76CC|5.0|10 levels of challenging puzzles to solve. Looking forward to more! I would recommend this app to anyone who enjoys solving puzzles.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had a great time playin this game both with &amp; without my grandfather's help can't wait to tell her I solved level 10 . Thx for such a fun game but u need to add more levels.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app is just what I was looking for. It is very accurate and the features are more than adequate for anyone needing a weather app.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|This was a great movie. With a lot of excitement. I just love a good movie with michael keaton in it. LOVED IT.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|just got it and have only played one level but so far its a great game that i can see really challenging me later
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app is corruption to kindle the constant adds an  if you miss click I instantly brings you to buy pro it constantly freezes crashes and take  forever to load and you can't click to a new  video from base  on what you  watching without clicking a button an  when you comment I  you click of for one second it posts it and when you go on a channel and you can't even look at the series it's just recent. And kindle this app is ridiculous you can watch videos on other websites kindle has corrupted  it so you can not go on YouTube without this app
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is the first alarm clock I have paid for and for the price it is a good app. It would be better if the led clock was in green or red for night time use.
0790733226|5.0|This was a great movie. With a lot of twists. I just love a good movie with Matthew McConaughey in it. LOVED IT.
B0059WTMLW|3.0|if you love it like me you will like this game but it killed my battery too fast for me to keep it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's really fun for kid's and I like I just wish there was a better way to get coins other than buying
B00AIA89HS|5.0|Hatebreed makes the perfect combination of hardcore, thrash, crossover, crust and even grind at some songs, with rapid, well played and passioned sound in every record, and this is no different. Since Satisfaction..... the band has made excellent records without losing the power and filth of hardcore music attached to its many influences. I wish I could see these guys live cause it must be an extreme music apogeum.
B004SIP9E2|5.0|This was a great movie. With a lot of fun. I just love a good movie with the waynes brothers in it. LOVED IT.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|just got it but im already on level 5 with my afro monkey can really see myself wasting hours with this boxing monkey
B00634GHJA|5.0|I love working with pictures and have a lot on my computer. I was wondering how I was going to grt them on my kindle<br />then I saw this app. I now have my favorite pictures on my kindle. It was eady to transfer the pictures love this app.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Stupid that it takes so much memory. I deleted half my apps so my son could potentially play this but it still wasn't enough! So is this the only game people have on their Kindle in order to play?! I better get a refund!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I have had trouble with the power cords from the get go.  I would set my Kindle to charge over night, only to find it hadn't charged at all.  I have been sent knew cords and still had charging issues.  At the end, I would have to jiggle the cord just right to get it charge, and hope that it didn't get bumped.  When I ordered this along with the wall charger, I have had no problems.  This is what should have been sent with my Kindle in the first place.  Hopefully, it is what they are doing now.
B00881VLCE|1.0|i hate the game and how it played on my device just horrible display made it seem like i had a blurry screen just all around bad
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Ready for Fifty shades of free. The second time reading this book great read the first go round . Even Better the second read  I guess rushing to get to book three the time around missed couple main plots to the book. Now ready for book three.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I hav enjoyed the series and look foward to more by author . Waiting on the movie to come out, hoping my husband will go with me to see it.
0316228583|4.0|The descriptive writing and character development are unequaled; it's a bit of a dark story and its hard to find someone to like or root for but nonetheless its a great read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love this game and can not wait for the other room to be in the update best game i have on my phone
B000JMKQX0|4.0|These collage of tales really takes you through the emotional toll that these survivors are living through. I guess what I mean to say is, if a zombie apocalypse were to happen (heaven forbid), tales such as these wouldn't be too far off the mark. Would absolutely recommend for the zombie fan at heart.
1451626096|5.0|Loving this book!!... The author keeps her great writing and makes you feel like you're right next to where everything's happening.
B00371QQ0M|4.0|This is the Blu ray of the sci-fi classic Dune.  I won't focus on the details of the film itself or comparison to the book, since everyone reading this is already familiar with the movie, and this is the theatrical cut.  The transfer is crisp for the most part, and for a movie released in 1981, it looks pretty decent in hi def.  Some grain is noticeable in certain scenes, but for the most part, it looks good.  There are one extras, including deleted scenes.  I was disappointed that the extended cut was not included, nor were any new extras.  There has always been a rumored Lynch 5 hour cut, which may or may not still exist.  That being said, I'd like to see a release with deleted scenes reinserted, commentary or a retrospective from cast and crew, etc.  A story as epic as Dune calls for an epic release,  but this Blu ray will do well enough for now, as it is a clear upgrade visually from the DVD version.  Plus, at $8.99, you can't beat the price!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|learning something about golf.  never played or paid attention to before.  it is a lot of fun especially because it gives feedback
0446563048|5.0|I reallly loved this book. Tony H. Is a brilliant entrepreneur. The writing is great too. I would recommend this to college student, wantpreneur and entrepreneurs.
1609611543|5.0|Learned so much from this read. I actually recommended it to 2 of my friends<br />Dr Williams  book is so full of valuable information
B007ZXK08C|4.0|My first Gillian Flynn book. I thought that the format was very clever - alternating and contrasting 'his and hers' diary entries. Each chapter brought a new twist to the plot which maintained the interest right to the climax. A very good read.
1597801585|2.0|There are aspects to this book that really peaked my interest. I am passionate about the topic of genetically engineered foods, and its consequences. This book was a disappointment. The idea was great, but the writing was tedious at best. I started counting at one point how often the author described the characters as \\"shrugged\\" \\"shrugging\\" or \\"shrugs\\". I started to think they all had a nervous shoulder shrugging twitch, because nobody shrugs that much, and especially not to every question. It is as laughable as it is maddening. Plus, as mentioned in previous reviews, none of the characters are particularly likeable. They are all kind of flat and missing back story. Then suddenly as I was reading, I was hit with a vile and graphic rape scene. I am reading and all of a sudden I am thinking \\"What the crap?!\\" Why is this happening? It is highly upsetting and visual. I couldn't get the image out of my mind. I was angry. It was perverted. I think it was only added to be titillating. Shame on the author.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|unfortunately these guys never got the respect they deserved stateside. This is a brilliantly conceived final show with excellent lighting, photography and musicianship.  The song selection is excellent and the concert well recorded. This band is so much more then &#34;Take On Me&#34;.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was so well written. It had a wonderful ending ! I love how the characters are described and have  their own personalities.
0316789720|5.0|My 7 year old loved this book. I may love it more. We have owned this book for more than a year and still go back to it. Great book to learn basic drawings. My favorite from all of his books.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game's graphic are beautiful and its just a nice game to pass the time! I feel in love at first click!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|This is a really excellent movie.  Great story, superb performances. Not your usual rom-com. WIth a couple of devastating scenes that people may recognize if they had a bad relationship.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is honestly a really addicting game..it's so fun to play you can't put it down.. xD a must play game haha
B003G4W49C|5.0|Holey bejesus !  I saw the preview to the movie, which looked good, and thought I would read the book.  Was not disappointed.  At first I was hesitant about it thinking it was a kids book, but it is not.  It is very well written, and the thoughts and ideas in it or well ahead of the time it was written. Plot was well conceived with nice twists throughout.  I was kind of upset at first since it did not really explain the &#34;bugger war&#34; in the beginning but it gets told slowly throughout.  And since the war happened long before Ender gets involved in it, it makes since to be told the way it was.  Definitely a good read and didn't want to put it down.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I just love the slick comedy in the movie! Jonah Hill is so hysterical. It was perfect for our double date movie night.
B001LF3YQK|2.0|I bought the Skip Hop Swipe Baby Wipes Casefor the stroller. At first it was easy to use, but you have to make sure that it's not too full or the red dot will not open.  Eventually the red dot will fall off... you can place it back into place, but it falls off frequently. Also when u place it into your diaper bag the red dot will move and open, exposing the wipes to air and dries them out, so when placing the case inside diaper bag you have to make sure that the red dot is closed which is annoying and not convenient at all. I think it's way over priced
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|I have been waiting to get this game ever since I played it on a friend's iPad. So I love this game. It is one of the best games I have come across, but it is hard to get used too. Hope you get it just to try it because it is fun.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Small and lightweight.  Can fit in a pocket easily or thrown in a gear bag without notice.  Sharpened up a dull blade pretty quick to a &#34;workable&#34; level.  Which is all I expected out of something so cheap.
B00578FKVE|5.0|As good as the movie. To bad it's was only two seasons never the less it is totally worth every minute. Enjoy
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. I have varied hobbies and interests. I used to clip up old magazines and keep the pictures and articles in seperate binders that took up space and still hard to find what you were looking for. pinterest made all that obsolete. scroll saw ideas go in one section and furniture plans can go in another. I love how the picture you select leads to a link to the corresponding article. its great you can follow other people to gain more ideas. only gripe is occasional freezing of the app. I use this everyday.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is smart and very entertaining. The acting and dialog is very good. The characters are distinct and likable. Although there many well-made series out there, some of them are dark and/or depressing (Damages, Hannibal), or too cruel & violent (Game of Thrones) or the entertainment factor is zero (The Killing). My ideal type of show is well-made, well-written, well-acted, the characters are likable, and the show overall is entertaining. Suits fits the bill.

B0041X90ZI|5.0|This is the live version of Transatlantic the Whirlwind CD it is a must buy for any Transatlantic fan. .
034580709X|3.0|This is actually the first Harry Hole book that was published in Norway.  Harry Hole has already captivated fans with later books that have been doled out to the English-reading public.  Here Harry is in Sydney Australia looking into the murder of a Norwegian national, a beautiful woman with some notoriety in her home country.<br /><br />The Bat provides some interesting detail of Australian culture, in particular its interaction with the native population.  Here Harry becomes acquainted with interesting locals in his hunt for the killer-including the friendly lead detective on the case, a charismatic transvestite performer and a beautiful Scandinavian bartender .  Harry's problems with alcohol are described in detail and he is on the wagon at the beginning of this book.  The stresses and danger of capturing a devious serial killer, a romantic entanglement, as well as the vicissitudes of partnering with a compelling yet flawed native policeman severely test Harry's sobriety and sanity.<br /><br />Nesbo's compelling characterizations, smart dialogue and realistic settings are evident in this first novel. Harry is alive and vivid from page one.  There are some problems with pacing and the novel lags at moments, weighted down in exploration of the characters.  Nevertheless suspense draws the reader to a stunning finish.  (As a side note I am curious as to why Nesbo chose to place Harry in Sydney in the first novel. It seems an odd choice.)
B003B02PEU|4.0|Not a wholly unexpected ending but a book well written in its telling and insight into Southern life. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Been a fan from the very first episode. Series is so wonderfully written you love the heroes and hate the villains. By the middle of the first series you realize they are written like real people and the heroes and villains have the best and worst of human frailties just like all of us. Now by this 3rd season I love all of them, even  the ones I love to hate! I am not a crier usually when I watch films but this one made me cry. I was upset for days. It is written like true life. The good guys don't always win and the bad guys don't always get caught and punished. My heart is still broken but I am still a fan and cant wait for the next season.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Everything about this movie is well done.  The lead character is well crafted and all the other characters such as the girls and the villains are funny as heck.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|One of the greatest and underestimated songwriters of his time.  I love the fact that he lost none of his original character.
0545265355|5.0|Received in perfect time.<br />Package came in great condition.<br />I was so excited to have this in my collection.<br />The price was reasonable too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interesting and lots of fun. Not for young children, but would play with my eight year old... perfect for plane ride or long trip...
B0012EM5D8|5.0|A well crafted, light, but very fun movie full of casual humor and clever stuff.  The animation is excellent and the Seinfeld touch is unmistakable.  A winner.
630587493X|5.0|I love the theme of this movie!  This was a great acting job by Robin Williams.  I've always loved the serious side of him
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|It's great that this game came out as an app to play against FB friends on the go. VERY addicting.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This genre is not my typically read however, I was unable to put this book down.  The story was masterfully written and wove an intriguing story of death, love, abandonment with hints of future stories to come.
B00AEFY66U|2.0|The Great Gatsby, 1974 film<br /><br />The movie begins with pleasure boats sailing on water. A men speaks about the times. He arrives at a mansion. Nick Caraway is a bond salesman on Wall Street. We see the lives of the idle rich. Tom Buchanan talks about \\"scientific proof\\" for the biases of that era. Daisy sees a nightingale on the lawn. Nick's neighbor is Jay Gatsby. We see a large tent set up there for an outdoor party. Nick hears the music there. Many people came to these parties. Tom takes Nick to a garage owned by Mr. Wilson; we see Mrs. Wilson. [This is a formula for trouble.] Tom and Myrtle make a scene! Nick goes to a Gatsby party. The guests gossip about Gatsby, little is known about him. Nick is invited to meet Gatsby in private. [Why?] A group of musicians arrive to play. Gatsby talks about himself, then about a business deal. Wolfschein fixed the 1919 World Series. Nick invites Daisy to a meeting.<br /><br />Gatsby meets Daisy at Nick's place. They go to Gatsby's mansion. [What business is he in?] Daisy is impressed by his wardrobe. Jay has a scrapbook filled with pictures of Daisy. [Isn't that weird?] We learn of their past friendship before the war. Tom gave Daisy an expensive string of pearls. [Does she seem in her right mind?] \\"Why didn't you wait for me?\\" \\"Rich girls don't marry poor boys.\\" There is another party. Couples dance the Charleston. Some fall into a pool. A lot of the newly rich people are bootleggers, says Tom. \\"You can't repeat the past\\" says Nick. Tom wants to learn about Gatsby. Daisy and Gatsby dance in the dim light. \\"I love you, Jay.\\" A reporter from the \\"New York Journal\\" questions Nick about Gatsby, he knows nothing. Gatsby has fired all the servants. \\"Why don't we go to town?\\" says Tom. Mr. Wilson wants to go West  with his wife, he isn't well. [Tuberculosis?]<br /><br />The cars arrive at a hotel. Tom questions Jay about Oxford. Jay tells Tom Daisy never loved him! Tom loves Daisy tho. Tom calls Jay a common swindler, \\"his drugstores sell alcohol over the counter\\". [Do patent medicines evade Prohibition?] Wilson talks to Myrtle, they argue. They learn of an accident; a big yellow car killed Myrtle! \\"Which church should I call, George?\\" Jay talks about the distant past. Was Daisy driving? What should they do? Mr. Wilson visits Tom. Jay swims in his pool. Mr. Wilson enters Jay's house; he has a big revolver. He fires it more than once. The police investigate the deaths. Gatsby's father arrives. Nick refuses to shake Tom's hand. The movie ends with the satiric song \\"Ain't We Got Fun\\".<br /><br />I never read the novel. If this an accurate portrayal I will avoid it. This movie runs on too long. Why do some praise this novel? Maybe for the details that were omitted from this movie. Why would Gatsby hold his parties? It allows people to meet and carry on business with more privacy than in other public places. Was Gatsby's friendship with Nick an attempt to infiltrate Wall Street to maybe swindle investors with over-valued stocks and bonds. Many people were swindled out of millions when they purchased over-valued bonds and stocks in the 1920s. Stockbrokers sold risky investments, some from foreign countries. The New Deal reforms put an end to many of these scams. But in the 1990s many of these laws were repealed or weakened to allow more scams. Ever hear of \\"Glass-Steagal\\"? You should! It also shows the hypocrisy and crookedness of the ruling class (the rich and famous). The book \\"Eight Men Out\\" tells about the 1919 World Series.
B000089RVX|3.0|The album is OK but the first song is too harsh for me.  I thought I was buying the first album which was lost to me.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|This is their best CD yet. Love the energy of the songs. Could do without the vulgarity in some of the songs (that are not on the radio), but enjoy my favorites just the same.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Loved it. I can't wait for the next in this series. Love all the different perspectives of the Cousin's War books. Powerful Women using what they could to get what they wanted!
B009LQKHIO|1.0|Would have been a good story except for the completely unnecessary x-rated scenes. No well-written story needs such scenes added. Disappointing!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is a monster.  Extremely heavy, yet well balanced in your hand.  I've honestly never seen a knife with a blade this thick.  I'd have no qualms about using it as a makeshift pry bar.  It came extremely sharp.  I can't yet say how well the blade will hold the edge or how easy / hard it is to resharpen.  If you could only have one piece of equipment with you, this knife would be it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I'm a huge Pixar fan, and Pixar does not disappoint with Monsters, Inc! Great story, with awesome computer animation! This is sure to be a classic one day!
B002WCLG48|4.0|it was a nice compilation of animations the last one being the best.<br />there were many different styles and it was very cool in a nerdy kind of way..teen and up will like it
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|Like the app easy to use. Creates space easily removes cache to increase memory. Plus it is free. I definetly recommend.
1781162646|5.0|I don't know why, because it's quite simple, but this book, to me, was very very good. I enjoyed the writing style, the story, the plot, the ending. Really liked it. I am funny about Stephen King. I either love his stuff or I hate it. I loved this.
B000002KGT|5.0|If you are a Fleetwood Mac fan, you know this is one of their best, and a must have for your collection.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Been waiting on this one it was just like playing the game, well executed and a lot of fun to watch. all of the main characters were there and the FX were Great!!  PG 13
B008602KQI|1.0|I'm not sure why Amazon is pushing this movie so hard, but this movie really sucks. Weak plot, bad acting, and bad directing. I'm not sure how anybody can give this more than two stars, but I wouldn't watch this again if someone paid me money to.<br /><br />I know part 2 of this movie is out or coming out. But, after the first one, I think I'll pass even if someone gives me a movie ticket to go watch it. Seriously bad movie!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I had this game for almost a week and I cannot stop playing it. It is so much fun. It's upbeat , always keeps you guessing with its obstacles Nd it's a constant challenge fore to beat my own score. It is beyond fun.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I was surprised when it ended and cannot wait to get reading the second of this series. For me this book ranks right up there with Hunger Games and the like. It's well worth your time.
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|As usual Andre has hit the mark. This is one of his better programs, but all of them are great. I wish I could find out which one of his albums has the Bond girls on it. I have 20 of his albums now and I'm still looking for more. Unfortunately a lot of them are not in the Area 1 NSTC format.
0679721037|5.0|I needed this book for a history class I was taking during my undergraduate degree and it was really helpful for my essay, a very interesting read!
B00CQ8U5ZE|5.0|Timeless Media Group did a good job on this Blu-ray. I did do a comparison of DVD from Shout's double feature and there is a difference between them both. The quality of the video is quite clear and sharper than the DVD. After the start of the opening credits the video quality improves. There isn't any old film dust on the BD and the audio sounds great. The audio provided is only English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 with no subtitles. The extras on this BD are Trailer, Interview with producer Albert Ruddy and two audio commentaries by the cast and the writers of \\"Death Hunt.\\" The movie is in Widescreen, color and runs for about 97mins. The cast include; Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin, Andrew Stevens, Angie Dickinson, Carl Weathers, Ed Lauter, Scott Hylands; Directed by Peter R. Hunt. Overall this is a great Action movie and Blu-ray release and is a product I would recommend.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Great story, I  never read the book I'll have to look for it. Amazon is the place for me THANK YOU !!!
B008JFUO36|4.0|Great effects and a pretty damn good cast.  One of the bad things about being an OLD Syfy fan is that you don't often get surprised.  So I gave it one more star than I originally would have.
B003INBOEC|5.0|Got here on time and its in very great shape almost like new!<br />Plays like new no scratches... I have no complains.<br />Very Happy!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was so much better than expected. I watched the movie first and then read the book and as usually the book exceeds expectations. Can not wait to finish reading the series.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is very challenging.Keeps me guessing. I Love it, and give it 4 stars. I would have given 5 stars if it gave more time in finding things.
0439023491|5.0|I loved this book. Granted the first is better, but this book is definitely my second favorite. It's so exciting to read!
0793563836|5.0|Using this book and CD's alone seemed good enough, but I also ordered the DVD. Teamed up, they make for FAST and GOOD learning!

B00CDY6HW6|3.0|I thought she'd want to chase bunnies. At 18 months.... well, she doesn't quite get the hang of it yet. I'll keep trying!
0547848412|5.0|No lie, I could not wait to read this book. Every chance I had to read, I would take it like there was no tomorrow. Every little break time I would spend reading. It's just culturally rich and vivid. The colors and descriptions come to life. The writing an absolute joy to keep up with and it always keeps you on your toes. I really hope that whoever buys this book appreciates the beauty in it as much as I did.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|This is a film...not a movie. Now my 2nd favorite Anderson film behind Rushmore. Anyone who knocks this film completely misses the whole point of film as an art form in general or doesn't know of the directors past works. Set in the 60's on a remote coastal community, the story is basically a forbidden love story between two slightly weird 12 year old. Yes its quirky, yes its long, and yes the biggest named actors are not the leads, but the film is pure art, and simply beautiful. Think of your first kiss...and how it was awkward, mysterious, a little scary, and yet completely AMAZING!!! That is this film, so if the world hasn't completely broke you yet, and you still have a little kid inside you somewhere, you cant help but find enjoyment in this film.<br />  Ive always believed that the point of films are to entertain and take you on an adventure. They either bring you back, take you far away, or expose you to aspects of the world that is foreign to you...and through that, evoke an emotion that will last past the closing credits. A movie, on the other hand, is really just eye candy that is in one ear and out the other, has no redeemable qualities, and evokes no thought or emotion other than basic caveman  s***. The people that trashed this film were obviously looking for a mindless hollywood blockbuster. Art is not for everyone.
1401324029|5.0|If you love Castle, I think you'll enjoy these.  My husband and i did.  just good fun because sometimes you're just not in the mood to think deeply.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Love the conversational style, real content and timeframe - movie takes place in real time which is smashing - who makes a movie that lasts 2 hours and is about 2 hours in 2 characters lives? And makes it work? Good film
0439023521|5.0|I could not stop reading this book. It is just so fantastic! I absolutely had a blast reading this. I'm not going to spoil anything, just trust me and read it.
B001QWBM62|5.0|This a a nice, very reliable, update technology in a small handy digital recorder.<br />I highly recommend it for pros as well as for common audiophiles.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Just terrific CD. There is a great variety of songs. I can listen to it over and over again! Oh wait I have!
B00AM0C6YG|4.0|Mvula has shades of Adele but definitely has her own sound. Not a 'canned' for mainstream CD. &#34;Father' is troubling - perhaps I hear too much. Other songs are joyous; love the rhythms in &#34;Green Garden&#34; and &#34;That's Alright&#34;. A girl becoming a woman with all the pain that sometimes entails.
0439023513|4.0|This is honestly a good book, but I've rated these books in the order they come in. I like the first book the most, the second book next, and the third is not as exciting as the first two, but it's still good. It just doesn't engage me as well as the first two books did. But it's part of a trilogy, so of course it would make sense to buy it. Hope you like it!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I was suggested that bingo blitz was much more fun! It is and I am hooked!  The best bingo for bingo lovers!! Highly recommended.  :)
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I have been an avid swimmer for the past couple years and have always wanted to be able to listen to music while getting a great workout in the pool. The FINIS Neptune MP3 player is exactly what I have been hoping for.<br /><br />The device's rechargeable batteries were already fully charged when I opened the package. Downloading music onto the player is as easy as plugging it's included USB cord into your computer, then dragging the song files to the mounted folder. The MP3 player clips onto the back of your goggle strap and the sound conduction pads clip on the sides of your goggle straps right in front of your ears. The sound waves are conducted through the bone into your inner ear. It is amazing how well this technology works.<br /><br />At first the sound was a little shallow, but after adjusting the built-in equalizer and repositioning the conduction pads I got a much better sound quality.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Music while you swim!<br />- Easy configuration<br />- Comfortable<br />- Holds lots of music<br />- Built-in equalizer<br /><br />CONS<br />- Poor playlist control<br /><br />I definitely recommend this device for anyone who loves to swim and wants to be able to listen to their music while they workout in the pool.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Slightly confusing at the start but addictive and simple once you get the hang of it. I would recommend it
1250006341|5.0|Bought this for my wife for mother's day at her request.  She loves the book and looks through it often.  She is very pleased with it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I read the Sookie Stackhouse novels as 'beach reads' meaning they are quick & entertaining reads for me. I see bad ratings for these novels, and think that people really expect too much! These are vampire books for cripes sake, not Pride and Prejudice. You don't exactly buy these for their literary genius! I like Charlaine Harris's characters, and I think she brought a unique idea to the vampire genre. I also watch True Blood, the TV series based off of these novels, and I like seeing the alternate path the characters take in the novels compared to the TV show. This is the last novel in the series, and it very nicely ties up Sookie's story line. I did, however, feel that this book, along with the books in the second half of this series, felt a little rushed. Bottom line: If you like the vampire genre and the True Blood Series, and you do not expect too much, this is a fun, quick and enjoyable read.
078322947X|5.0|To those that are not following Friedkin's tweets or facebook updates, Sorcerer has just been remastered (sound and image) and will be shown at the Venice Film Festival at the end of this month (August 2013).

B0074MZSWW|5.0|My husband and I regularly record SNL, and Alabama Shakes was the musical guest one night. By the time their second song played, I was online purchasing their CD. Brittany Howard has a set of pipes on her that is just beautiful to hear. The band has a southern, bluesy rock feel to it. I just love listening to this CD during the summer with my car windows rolled down. In an unexpected turn of events, my twin girls love the song &#34;Hold On&#34; and we have to play it over and over and over again as they bob their little heads up and down to the beat.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Seriously some people don't have access to a computer  So the next update male it a lot more like the computer version like minigames and spells a lot more minecraft lovers would get it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Well i  play minion rush on my kindle fire hd. But it constantly freezes my kindle fire up and out isn't my kindle cause it's doesn't v do that with any of my other activities. But it's super fun and addicting.

Side Note Did Get to See them open for Velvet Revolver ,, loved them live.. thank you...
B005RUUUAI|5.0|My husband and I caught onto this show late, after hearing about it from all of our friends on social media websites. We caught up on the first season, and had to buy the second season. Zombie apocalypse movies and shows are very popular right now, and this one reminds me of the movie &#34;28 Days Later&#34; the way the main character wakes up from a coma to find the world infected with zombies. This series somehow seams more realistic and down to earth than the zombie movies I've seen. Since it is a series, instead of a movie, you get to see the daily struggles humanity would face should this far-fetched scenario take place. There are very few shows that my husband and I BOTH like to watch, and this is one of them. If you haven't seen this show yet, you don't know what you are missing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hi random words of art free job of July HAPPY 4TH OF JULY in Their lives to use it would I miss the up all over here how,  done!!!!!
030758836X|5.0|After almost a week after finishing this book, I still get chills when I ponder some of the implications of the history of these characters. The device of alternating points of view of the husband and wife is very effective, keeping you off balance as you try to grasp \\"the truth\\"...if there is one. The author writes her diary entrys with such detail, we become a part of the story as we accept or reject each character's view of reality. This author is truly a master of psychological suspense.
B002RI9ORI|1.0|The book is appropriately titled as Mr Goldacre employs 'bad science' in his methodology - ironically, he speaks of the 'cherry picking' method of gathering data, and then proceeds to use this very same method to attempt to 'prove' his point. This is not worth reading.
8866130923|4.0|I bought this because someone at work had one.  It's a great organizer for the office.  I will be getting another one next year but I will be looking for the bigger one so I can also take notes with it.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|A wonderful read. Sorry to see it end.  One of those books you have to finish but miss before you finish the last page.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|wanted the movie.  That's it. I got cartoons and superfluous garbage with the DVD.  It was in good shape, but very disappointing.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|I saw the extended version of &#34;Dune&#34; probably 15 years ago when it ran on cable, and I remember enjoying it more than the shorter version released in theaters. Having now watched it again, I realize it was only because I hadn't read the book at that point. So the background material helped me understand the story better.<br /><br />Now that I've read the book, the cartoonish explanations at the beginning seem merely annoying - a cheap way to help audiences understand the backstory. And the additional footage doesn't really strengthen the movie.<br /><br />Since this version also comes with the theatrical release, I don't regret buying it. The metal box is great. But if all you're interested in is the movie, you really don't need the extended version.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Can't even get Candy Crush on Kindle-I deleted this the day I downloaded it. Why have a &#34;guide&#34; available if you don't offer the app
B00499QUK2|5.0|Fast paced but not confusing. My favorite part is all the information Sherlock collects by just observing the person, the situation. I really wish there were more than just 3 episodes. Great TV
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I tried several different ways to write up this review and ended up deleting them all because I can't express the right words.<br />But here is my direct to the point personal opinion:<br /><br />This movie is awesome.<br /><br />Great entertainment and performances by the cast (regardless of how you feel about Tom Cruise he did an excellent job).<br />If you love sci-fi, action & adventure I highly recommend this film.<br />It even has a nice love story that isn't cheesy or useless.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Tim Burton's take on the TV drama, with Johnny Depp making the vampire his own for the next 100 years. The movie's cast were spectacularly playing the characters. Mush better than the TV series could ever be. (&#34;Dark Shadow's&#34; fans please don't bite me.) It was serious drama filled with humor. Some LOL, and plenty of dramatic tension. I couldn't help but like all of the disjointed characters. I enjoyed the entire film.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The reason I purchased my kindle was to play game's. I thought I wanted race, fast paced game's, who knew I would like relaxed puzzle game's. I first got Quell and really liked it, but The Room is great! I can't wait for the next Room. GET IT!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's okay in that it seems a little slow. Maybe as I get farther along the speed will pick up. It is fun tho.
B001TODOCM|2.0|I just couldn't get into the story. It was hard to follow in the beginning so I had to move on.
B00C9G22R2|5.0|Make no mistake, when a film is directed by Wong Kar Wai (\\"2041\\"), it will be artistic no matter what audience expectations may be. Naturally he includes martial arts, but as we already know, most martial art films depend heavily on visual and audio editing. Remember \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" with the gravity-defying action? There is a bit of that here as well. But the visual editing is perfection: each scene is framed with loving care and a careful eye.<br /><br />The film is loaded with Eastern aphorisms which floated in one ear and out the other, although I liked the one about two martial elements: horizontal and vertical. If you are vertical at the end of a bout... you won. Even I can understand THAT one!<br /><br />Along with the visual excellence I always expect from this director, I had the pleasure of watching two of my favorite Asian actors:<br />  * Tony Leung (\\"In the Mood for Love\\") is Ip Man, our martial arts master who, after fundamental changes and loss in his life, eventually ends up in Hong Kong and establishes the school where Bruce Lee trains.<br />  * Ziyi Zhang (\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\") is Gong Er, the gifted daughter of a martial arts grandmaster who had the misfortune to be born female. She is the master of a specialized school of martial arts but swears to never disclose her secrets.<br /><br />If you have been lucky enough to see \\"In the Mood for Love\\" you know not to expect gunshots or sweaty bodies but you also know there will be an achingly poignant love story. The sound track has a touch of western music that we recognize, plus some eastern pieces, as well.<br /><br />We see our star-crossed lovers as they and their families are caught up in the invasion of China by the Japanese, WW II and a sea change in the way Hong Kong is governed. We see starvation and cruelty, elegance and beauty, i.e., the full panoply of Far Eastern history in the mid-1900s.<br /><br />And those actors are STILL two of my favorites! This will go in my collection from Amazon.tion from Amazon.
B002M9WW30|5.0|My boyfriend loves the Rocky movies, and owns most of them on DVD, but was missing 3. When searching Amazon for the 3 he was missing, I came across these. For $27, it was cheaper to buy the entire set then the 3 individually. And they are blu-ray, which makes them even better! The picture is gorgeous and I would definitely purchase it again in a heartbeat!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I LOVE this book. I am all ready to get the next book. I am going to read the book tomorrow after school.
0061122416|4.0|There was coffee stain or what appeared to be coffee stain on the book, but those kinds of things happen when you buy used books. Though, everything else was pretty good, no ripped pages or weird smells. Good book by the way.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|My favorite Shakespearean comedy directed by my favorite American director, which features one of my favorite Canadian/American actors. It doesn't get any better than this!<br /><br />Joss Whedon (\\"The Avengers\\" and Lots of TV) adapted the screenplay and directed this little black and white PG-13 gem, shot in his own personal home over a two-week period. It's really nice working with former colleagues where everybody knows everybody. During the Q&A which followed the screening of this little treasure, he said the most difficult part was working out in his yard, because the neighbors were sanding their floors, many dogs in the neighborhood were barking, and he doesn't live very far from the Santa Monica Airport.<br /><br />He worked with:<br />  * Amy Acker (\\"The Cabin in the Woods\\") as Beatrice, the willful woman who hasn't forgiven \\"that man\\" for the slight she suffered a couple of years back.<br />  * Alexis Denisof (\\"The Avengers\\") is Benedick, who is every bit the misogynist Beatrice holds in such contempt, furthermore he can't bring himself to utter the \\"M\\" word (\\"Marriage\\").<br />  * Fran Kranz (\\"The Cabin in the Woods\\") is Claudio, the young man Benedick tries in vain to steer away from matrimony.<br />  * Jillian Morgese (\\"The Avengers\\") is Hero, who makes the fourth for our two sets of star-crossed lovers.<br />  * Clark Gregg (\\"The Avengers\\") is Leonato, Hero's father. He is the host for this weekend in the country that starts the ball rolling.<br />  * Nathan Fillion (\\"Castle\\" and \\"Firefly\\") is Dogberry, Mister Malaprop, ego at full sail, with his adoring assistant echoing his every move.<br />  * Sean Maher (\\"Firefly\\" and \\"Serenity\\") is Don John, the villain of the piece.<br /><br />The 2013 Seattle International Film Festival opening night audience obviously knew their Shakespeare and they REALLY knew their Whedon! As you can clearly see, this cast has worked with him before and it seems they have remained friends. I've pre-ordered my DVD from Amazon.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book has it all. Rarely do u see a second book in series be well written. The second book expanded on the characters, added a few more and kept you guessing all throughout.  So far an excellent series. Cannot wait for the third book
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Great read cannot wait to start the next book in the series, I could not put it down it was great
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Although not a masterpiece of cinema this is an interesting and more importantly moving, nuance  movie.<br />I watched it with an 8 year old and a 14 year old and love the whole feel of the characters and setting.<br />Ending has a bad word but it's so appropriately used that my mature 8 year old understood the context entirely. (Also promised not to repeat it)
B005VPRG10|4.0|It is a very nice set but for my taste it was too easy to build. I prefer more challenging things.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Loved the book! I thought the author was clear and honest and came away with the realization that we don't have to like Jobs to appreciate his genius and commitment to excellent products and experiences.<br /><br />I came late to Apple products - just two years ago with my first iPhone (4). Now I have 2 iPhones, 2 iPods, 2 iPads and finally caved and bought an MacBook Air. I resisted on every one of them but softened as they each met my needs better than any other camera, music device or PC ever has in the past. As I use them I learn more and and have become a lifelong Apple device user - as long as they continue the level of innovation and excellence in their products that Jobs has inspired.<br /><br />Until I read this book I would not have been able to say why I loved these devices, now I know... And the gifts Jobs gave the world are these devices that work with our conscious minds and fingers AND to our unconscious delight - indeed, meeting needs we didn't know had.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|Admittedly, I watched the movie before I read the book.  I also liked the movie.  I know, I know, I'm in the minority here.  The book was a surprise.  I found it a bit of a chore to read at times, but really loved the insights into human nature.  I'm worried that the hype around the book (multiple friends telling me it's the BEST ZOMBIE BOOK EVER!!) may have greatly increased my expectations. :)
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|very very depressing. a person with cancer or have a family member with cancer does not need any more negitive thoughts.  It dwells on dieing and not of hope.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|The game Bingo Blitz is really a fun game to play, especial if you like bingo which I do.  That's why I choose the game.

I choose this game to play it but didn't  think I'd like it but I really enjoy playing  it.  It's loads of fun.I'd definitely recommend it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried after reading this book.  I don't think it was from sadness, although loss is prevalent in this novel.  I think it was from reconciliation and hope. I truly fell in love with The Fault in our Stars.  It's one of my top 10 favorite books. Well-written and meaningful.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Been stuck on this game since I started..you will not put this game down<br />Puzzles that aren't too hard and aren't too easy

B000HKYOK0|5.0|What can I say. I watched the original Star Trek series for three years, on a black and white tv.  I watched reruns and all the movies and some of the follow up series. The series grew on me from the very beginning and I love watching again (and again) in digital color, without commercials!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this bingo game. I am totally addicted to it. I love the different rooms and being able to share extra collection items with my friends. One of my 2 favorites! I also like the tournament room. This app has so much to offer. I hope once I get closer to completing all the locations they will add more!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very fun. I started this game and at first thought it was a little cheesy. But after I figured out how to earn more maps &amp; vehicles it became a lot more fun.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|It is started out weird however, it draws you further in and before you know it your watching another episode.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|7 year old loves this.  The bonus figure was a nice touch.  His favorite bit of the movie is the Joker singing along while working in the truck.  I have no idea why.
006056251X|5.0|When I read read the end of, \\"It Happened one Autumn,\\" and seen what Evangeline was doing I wasn't sure I liked it.    Sebastian kidnapped Lillian, Evangeline is Lillian friend. The two seemed impossible in my world because you don't date a friends ex especially one who wanted to abduct your friend. At least that's how it is in real life but you know what? LK has a way of changing your mind and you won't even know when it happened. The more I read the the deeper I was sucked into her web.    The key to any beautiful relationship is when the person your with makes you a better person and they did that for each other. Evangeline is shy and stutters due to her past and Sebastian gave her the courage to stop being afraid and speak out. When she needed him the most he was there for her and taught how to continue and she gave him a purpose. She taught him that attraction goes way beyond the skin and before he knew what hit him, brought him to his knees.    I love how almost all of the early books written by LK kept inner connecting characters to other stories she developed, made a whole new world as she would mention a past Hero or Heroin. Evangeline Jenner is daughter to Ivo Jenner a Gambling/whore house owner and he is connected to one of my other favorite books by her entitled, \\"Dreaming Of You.\\"    The story continues to pull these two together and we once again get to see Marcus and Lillian who are convinced Sebastian abducted Evangeline and once again Marcus witnesses a selfless act when sebastian throws himself in the path of danger to save the woman he loves. Once again Westcliff is left scratching his head wondering who is this man? The story is a beautiful story about two people who seperatly were nothing extraordinary, or you may even say they were scum( in sebastians case) but together these two people became something very special and very rare.

B00ECR7L0Y|2.0|An interesting idea but doesn't really work.  The modern take on the comedy is more distracting than enlightening and the acting was only so-so.
B00E193Y36|5.0|Been waiting for a new album from the band. After the long wait I am not disappointed with The Wrong Side Of Heaven And the Righteous Side of Hell. Great album and I can't wait for Volume 2!
1594484805|5.0|Before I retired I taught in the Communications Department of our local college.  Among courses I taught was Interpersonal Communication.  I'm sorry this book didn't come along when I was still teaching, because he is right on about what motivates us, some I which I already recognized, but I did learn some more from him.<br /><br />I have discussed this book with friends at lunch.

630471193X|5.0|A deeply moving examination of the human spirit, exposing human weakness and its path to unimaginable beauty and strength. Travolta is the ideal choice for this role that examines the fears we all feel in the face of otherness, and the heights we are destined to attain.
B0041D843M|1.0|This book states that vegetarianism will save you from cancer? I grew up vegetarian in the 1980's and the only thing that saved my health was Seventh Day Adventists back then ate whole milk, real butter and real eggs. I have had hormonal issues for years because of all the soy in my childhood. It wasn't until I started eating a WAPF traditional foods way of eating that my periods regulated, my extra weight dropped off and my strength returned. This book is propaganda for ill health.<br />My two family members who remained vegetarian had cancer, my Dad at 39, my Grandma at 59. Look up Weston A Price Foundation.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app has amazing graphics and it is fun for people of all ages. I only wish they had more horse breeds.
0374105235|5.0|A ready commodity and easily molded into killing machines, the children of certain African countries are taught to kill before they are taught that it is wrong.  With tremendous courage Beah examines what he endured, and how he was able to escape, with the help of others, to become a whistleblower against this humanitarian outrage.  Subjected to unimaginable horrors and to come through to the other side of a living purgatory, this child soldier is perhaps the best product his experiences could have wrought.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This is just getting better and better every season this is well written one of the series that I am always looking forward to watch.
1451648537|4.0|This biography of the late Steve Jobs successfully fills the role of what a biography should be. Namely, provide a review of the subject's life and major influential events. However, this book fails in a couple of ways. Author Walter Isaacson, veers wildly between overly gushing and critical. He airs many of Jobs skeletons, including cheating friends  out of money or credit, however trivial, or the pathetic way he often treated family and colleagues.<br /><br />Jobs was a visionary leader, who created great electronics. But he was also a narcissistic, bullying, and delusional (with his own \\"reality distortion window\\"). Bottom line, this is a decent book about an interesting subject.<br /><br />One final quibble: if the reader drank every time Isaacson writes \\"Jobs was furious\\" or some variant, you would soon be dead.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|This was the perfect barebones shuttle for the VMware ESXi 5.1 server I was building.  I loaded it up with a Intel i5 3570 with 32 gb of memory and a Thermaltake MAX 1542 2.5 hard drive cage.  Added to that 4 2.5 INCH hard drives and an HP P400 raid card.  Booting the system from an 8 gb thumb drive.  I was more than satisfied with results.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best movies ever made. The musical scores are completely unrivaled(including during one of the best duel scenes ever), and the cinematography was visionary. Masterpiece.
B006O7XOOW|1.0|This product is poorly designed but easy to put together.  The top portion of the toy moves up and down and is extremely loud.  You can hear the motor running and it totally takes away from the toy.  I thought the toy would be more than just simply putting balls in the top and watching them fall.  We ended up getting a play table that also has a ball function that the baby likes much more.
0061950726|5.0|This was a quick read - no real surprises with regard to plot or character development, but it was enjoyable.  It did prompt me to research these orphans and the time period.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this story line even though it was far from what I expected...it is one of those books that make you question your own grip on reality...
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This book was written quickly and had several spelling and grammatical errors which annoyed me as I read, but the story was interesting and it hasn't stopped me from reading the rest of the books...
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This game is free to play with in game purchases possible. You can play without buying, but as with most games you miss out on features or it takes longer. There is great support by the developers and community (forum) as the game undergoes updates regularly,BUT the bad part of this game is that the versions are not updated on Amazon as quickly as those who play through other mediums. This means you  miss out on somethings until you can get the game updated. That really is my only frustration as the game more than makes up for its faults when it works...
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I wanted to read this book, subtitled My Year in a Women's Prison,  because I was interested in the subject and don't plan on ever learning about it firsthand.  I didn't expect it to be well  written and I though it would possibly get boring.  After all, how much can you say about day after day of the same old routine?<br /><br />I was wrong on both counts.  Piper Kerman starts off by explaining what she did to end up in prison:  transporting drug money.  Instead of whining about how it wasn't really her fault and how she was duped, she admitted that it was both a stupid and a criminal act that she committed.  (I hate whining unless, of course, I am the one doing it, and then it is always entirely justified.)  Several years after the act, she was charged and pleaded guilty with a plea agreement.  Another several years went by before she actually was sent to prison, time that she spent in limbo waiting for her prison time so that she could finish it and truly begin life again.<br /><br />Piper was sent to a facility in Danbury, Connecticut, an easier place to serve time than the hard core prisons.  Nevertheless, there were entirely new rules to learn and a complete new culture.  She describes some of her fellow inmates with both insight and compassion, and surprised herself by how much she grew to like some of the women.  She also recognized that as a blond-haired, blue-eyed white girl with supportive and relatively wealthy family and friends, and had a lot of advantages that others didn't.  Many of her fellow inmates came from areas where the economy was almost entirely dependent on criminal activity and had inadequate legal support.<br /><br />Along these lines, she also discussed without being too preachy the shortcomings of the penal system.  These women who had for the most part been convicted of nonviolent crimes were given almost nothing in the way of rehabilitation, education, or help to learn to re-enter society.  Warehousing these women is both expensive and ineffectual, and there has to be a better way.  As an example, one re-entry program about housing did not help the women learn how to find housing once they were released but did discuss the pros and cons of aluminum siding.<br /><br />This book is not a humorous book in the traditional sense but it is written with humor and compassion.  Considering that the setting is a prison, there is surprisingly little profanity other than occasional use of the f-word, although there are certainly some colorful people whose practices and beliefs are a bubble off normal.  I appreciated the style of writing.  In describing a time when some of the normal amenities were unavailable, Ms. Kerman writes \\"two hundred women, no phones, no washing machines, no hair dryers - it was like Lord of the Flies on estrogen.  I sure as hell wasn't going to be Piggy.\\"  The book was entertaining and entertaining and, in my opinion, a very good read.d ineffectual, and there has to be a better way.

B005544TRQ|4.0|I like the characters, especially Louis .  It is fast paced ,intelligent ,and classy show .  I don't think it was marketed very well.  It seems that most people are discovering the show by word of mouth.  I found out about it through a family member and have since told friends (all have never heard or seen the show).
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Explicit lyrics so not suitable for the youngest but great music!<br />Fun keeps true to their music with lively beats.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Excellent writing!  I love this show.  Love the characters, the writers give you just enough to love them.  The language is on the bad side but it goes with the situation and doesn't take away from the show.
B004VJJF34|4.0|One of the great classics in musicals of all time. By having it in my collection I can watch it whenever I like.
B00CO52NLI|4.0|It's a really fun game, at first. You get to play with hamsters, gineie pigs, and rabbits! There are also horses, cats,dogs,birds, and reptiles. However, cats an d dogs at err both 1.99 in real money and the others ( not hamsters bunnies or gineies) are 0.99. With the very limited amount of things u can do with the bunnies, etc. It's not worth it to have, but that's my opinion. But it is still a good game and has good graphics.
0446573027|4.0|Good book, kept my interest.<br />For fans of Jack Reacher, Baldacci's &#34;hero&#34; is John Puller!<br />John is a milder, kinder version of Jack but still lots of action
B0027DK206|3.0|I was underwhelmed with the instant back. It's awkward battery is a pain to keep replacing after such short amounts of shooting. The Diana photos also don't translate to instax mini very well. It works well and I have no problems with the functionality; I was just not thrilled.
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|An incredible tale of life in North Korea, where no one can be open and honest, where there is famine, decay and cruelty in plenty. A very dystopian world. But the Everyman hero, Jun Do, despite all that happens to him, manages to love someone truly, heroically, and effect a release, knowing that he is sacrificing himself ... And others. Seriously good writing.

B000002J1U|5.0|I was a big zeppelin freak in the 70's and I still am. This LP/CD has still got it. I am just as excited now as I was when I first bought the LP back in the day. Even better it keeps reminding me of those wonderful years as a teenager in the 70's and all the concerts I attended. Especially The Song Remains The Same tour. What a show! Led Zeppelin in its prime at the old Capital Center in Washington D.C. Thank you Amazon for keeping these timeless classics available for the the younger generations to discover. I just love your library.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Its good with posting pics and wallposts, but if you have an interest list, it wont work. It'll keep telling you, needed updating, when ya push to update, your rerouted to googles update, only one company needs my credit card on file not 2.<br />This app is starting to.suck

0894803123|2.0|I think I may be the only reviewer out of 417 that isn't giving lesser stars because of the raw egg factor, but rather for another reason. (For all the uproar about raw eggs, I guess none of you eat raw cookie dough? I know I sure do. And have never gotten sick from it. You'll live) my problem with these recipes is that it results in very icy ice cream!? The ice crystals completely take away from what would be an otherwise great product. Other reviews said the same thing and that if you 'cook' the eggs first, it makes a huge difference. (For everyone saying they cant find pasturized eggs- theyre the kind you get out of the carton. theyll be right next to regular eggs. while maling it safe(r?) to consume raw, they will still cause ice crystals)This was a problem with both the French vanilla and mocha chocolate covered almond. Both calling for a base of 2 cups heavy whipping cream, 2 eggs, and 1 C milk. I thought my problem might have been from using 1% milk= too much water content, but other reviewers have led me to believe otherwise. Ingredients are too expensive to be wasted on mediocre, at best, ice cream. Whipping cream, chocolate covered almonds, and instant coffee alone cost over $9- not what I would normally spend on 1 quart of ice cream.<br />*End rant<br />I should note that the chocolate brownies from this book are the best I've ever had, however<br />If anyone has suggestions on another ice cream cookbook that has better results, please share
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I loved this book. How they fought the twin giants and saved Nick and annabeth found the statue and how she succeeded. The part I didn't like is when the fell to tartarus but at leas percy and annabeth would have each other.
0823003590|5.0|I love this book, it gives insight into drawing…however one still needs models.<br />This isn’t like an anime type book that’s going to make you do a grid and stuff, which usually when gridding for a realistic style usually makes the drawing flat.<br /> This book will show you techniques all while encouraging your style.<br />This book isn’t a step by step guide, and yes you still need models, but it’s excellent.
B000AP04FG|4.0|Was a good movie with lot of action and I like the ending of it also. I would recommend the movie. It was also a good price.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I absolutely love Stephenie Myers writing and couldn't wait to see this movie.  I think they did a fine job of transferring this book unto film.  This is a really good movie and I highly recommend it.  It's about an alien invasion where the aliens take over the bodies of humans inhabiting their bodies without loosing the persons memories.  The human is trapped in their own bodies with no control.  The main character avoided the aliens for a long time but eventually is caught and inplanted with an alien being.  The alien inhabiting her body has sympathy for the human race and ends up siding with the few humans still not possessed.  The story is her struggle to convince the humans she is on their side.  Excellent movie ad highly recommended.

0544002318|3.0|and he does not shy from praising his own accomplishments.  enjoy a book about scott jurek by scott jurek, but keep your own accomplishments close at heart while you read.  in fact, you might drop the book and go find a trail to run your own path.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mincemeat is great I got so many diamonds and gold and iron with my diamonds I got a diamond block now I am save up to craft a diamond get minecraft rocks get it
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great game and so easy to do.  Also like lots of versions of solitare.  More versions of mahjong too.  Thanks for the fun free games.<br /><br />  I love mahjong and would love more renditions of it.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Every episode I laugh out loud. The writing and delivery are so funny. It may not be the most original idea, but I'm hooked!
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|I got hooked on \\"Hannibal\\" very quickly.  The acting of the leads is truly superb.  The<br />characters of Will Graham and Jack Crawford couldn't be better.  Hugh Dancy's conviction<br />is unmatched in TV acting, and Lawrence Fishburn brings movie star credibility to the<br />show.  As for Hannibal himself, when I first heard about this show, I thought there'd be<br />no way anyone could do anything with the character other than tarnish Anthony Hopkins'<br />legendary portrayals.  But from the first episode, I was fascinated by the job Mads<br />Mikkelsen was doing.  By the end of the second episode, I was hopelessly enamored with the<br />show and anxiously anticipating the next week's installment.  The writing is fantastic,<br />and of course the gore goes much further than any network drama I've ever seen.  During<br />the season, I was often surprised by how much leeway the show was given to depict the<br />gruesome murders committed by Lecter and various other serial killers being hunted by the<br />FBI.  I was overjoyed to hear that \\"Hannibal\\" got renewed for a second season, and nearly<br />crushed by the news that I'd have to wait until summer 2014 for it to start.  This is a<br />great series, and if the quality stays as high as Season 1, I'd love to see creator Bryan<br />Fuller reach his goal of adapting all of the Hannibal novels.
B00280LYIC|5.0|BECAUSE I LOVE THIS BOOK THE LIGHTING THEF but I am still reading this wonderful amasing book of very  fun book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0761119752|5.0|Got this as a second copy to keep at grandma's house. This way it's one less thing to remember to Pack. She loves singing the verse. Great getting ready for bed book.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|Okay, when I first saw this book being promoted 2 days ago, I thought 'this totally looks like something I might like'. I didn't buy it right away, I saw the price and I thought well how many pages is it? I couldn't find that anywhere but then a blog site I follow told me she read a beta or arc copy (i can't remember which) and it was over 200 pages. So I picked it up..<br /><br />Then my issue was, an entire book from a male POV. I have read those before and lately they have been really not my thing. Either they are sequels from a previous female POV that was botched or the author made the male sound way too girly..<br /><br />This book did NOT do that. In fact, I am pretty sure the author is either a male (lol) or knows men VERY well because I couldn't tell for a second that a woman was actually writing this..<br /><br />Now. On to the story..<br /><br />Chase is a player, he is a hot guy, who can have any woman he wants and doesn't have to work for it but he has one rule. He never sleeps with the same girl twice. Hey he can afford that..<br /><br />The he meets Kate, who later turns out to be a new associate at his father's business, and he falls for her. But clearly, from just the synopsis you know that it does not go well, because the book starts with Chase dealing with the 'flu' and man is he 'sick'.<br /><br />Chase is a jerk, so the book has a little bit of angst and drama, but he is hot, and he is confident and he knows just what to say to get what he wants, and all he wants is Kate.<br /><br />He is sweet with his family, so he is not an all around loser, and Kate is tough, she isn't a weak woman who falls for a guy just because he is hot or rich. She really stands her ground with Chase and I loved that about her..<br /><br />the book was a quick read for me. I would love to see more from these 2, or even an epilogue or something . It was a funny read too, chase is sarcastic and he has several lines in there that just made me actually laugh out loud..<br /><br />You felt what he was feeling, although I wasn't always sure he choices were the right ones (in fact more times than not I thought he was being an idiot lol) but it is pulled off, and it was really a great read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the best game that I have ever played .It is so much fun. I have always loved playing with my horse.
0061124958|5.0|This book got me through grade school!  I remember reading it over and over.  It's as if the characters were my best friends!  Adorable book for every generation, past, present, and future.  Thanks E.B. White, for the sweet memories.  I liked reading because of you!
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I stopped reading this book, it was not the least bit captivating.  I would not recommend it at all. If it does get more interesting, the author took too long to get into the interesting part of the story. I rarely stop reading a book once I've started it.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I enjoy the acting and the story line has many plot twists and surprises...a real great &#34;period&#34; piece...you can really get involved with the characters.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|awesome effects great remake i loved every second of it. i hope the next one is just as good or better!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing! It's worth every little penny! I hope you try this game out. It's soooo addicting!!!  Before you get minecraft look up minecraft Captinsparklez on YouTube and watch the awesome game in motion!!! You'll love it!!!
0446672653|5.0|The author presents information for a case history that is convincing and interesting. I am looking into reading more on the topic.
B0000C8AW7|5.0|Love Bob Dylan past and present?  Then do yourself a big.favor and add this cd to your collection.  The poet master is brilliantly at work with songs a little softer to the ear then on The TEMPEST. It's my new favorite of all 20 cd's of his I own!
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Works as advertised. Nice bag, but...This is a big backpack, much larger than I expected. Too big to conveniently carry just my camera and an extra lens. Would make sense if I had several lenses and extra stuff. Came free with my camera, so maybe I shouldn't complain.
B006RXQ3GO|4.0|Really good movie, not as good as everyone made it out to be, but I still liked it. I wouldn't say I loved the movie.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It was a great book I loved it. Not to influence any opinions but I think you should definitely read this book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This DVD arrived just yesterday and my grand kids were so happy.<br />We watched it right away and they were thrilled. Thanks.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I had never seen an \\"Anker\\" anything before, but I was very interested from the positive reviews and unique look of their 8000 DPI gaming mouse.<br /><br />If you prefer a \\"claw\\" type grip on your mouse, and have an average sized thumb, this mouse is easily one of the best you can possibly purchase.<br /><br />The thumb buttons on the side are made so that you can easily press any of the 3 buttons without disturbing your mouse position, I'm talking to you FPS fans! I used to leave my thumb buttons untouched merely because they were not convenient to use in comparison to keyboard keys, and they often couldn't even be keybound. The software that comes with the mouse allows you to set up macros in order to ALWAYS be able to make a keybinding for it, no matter the game.<br /><br />One important difference that is better for some and perhaps worse for others, is that the mouse roller is set intentionally further back than regular mice. This allows the button directly in front of the roller to be hit easily by your middle finger, and while it makes using the roller slightly more cumbersome, having the extra button so easily accessible is a feature I won't be able to forget. Every gamer should give this mouse a try so that they can experience the incredible functionality that Anker has practically invented.<br /><br />The look of the mouse is fantastic, and it feels like a well made piece of technology, certainly not cheap. The price of the mouse itself is not all that high, but it performs just like a 100$ mouse would.<br /><br />After having used this mouse for a couple weeks it has increased my confidence and ability in competitive gaming. You simply have to get your hands on this mouse to know what I'm talking about, and after you have the opportunity you won't ever look back to the mainstream inferior trash that is sold in high volume.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Wonderful DVD. It is in great condition and withholds a great concert. I love Michael Jackson and anyone else who does would not regret owning it.
B003IN7YPU|5.0|My son is leaving soon for basic training in the Marines.  He loves anything to do with World War history.  He always said he was born in the wrong era.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The most heartfelt book I've read in along time. You feel the story and the characters. They leave their mark.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Matt Smith as the new Dr. Who does an excellent job!!  Can't wait to watch season six and seven.<br />Now a major Dr. Who fan!!!
B00003CXAE|5.0|This movie never gets old. One of the best musicals and movies of all time. It is in great condition.
B00E66QPCG|1.0|The simple strategy book is based on Markus Heitkoetter's and Mark Hodge's strategies they also use in their day trading courses. Based on break out bars and the use of MACD, RSI and Bollinger bands. Probably good to fool the masses, but spending $6.04 on this book is money down the drain. Proof that it is worhtless? Well let me tell you that one of Markus' key moderators (Brian Larson) left Rockwell Trading to start a career in the US \\"booming\\" real estate business. Why was that? As a moderator he knew the strategies inside out. Why didn't he started trading from the comfort of his own home? What Markus is selling doesn't work. More info? Just google Rockwell Trading and most likely you'll find my youtube vdo regarding Rockwell Trading within the first ten results. This vdo also leads you to my website with all the background info on Rockwell Trading and Markus Heitkoetter.
B0040X46TE|5.0|I love this album, great easy listening, somewhere over the rainbow Is my favorite song. If you want a good album, where you can just mellow out get this one.! One of the main reason I love this album as it reminds me of my daughter, Kristin, who I love very much and sadly for me she went home to \\"our father\\" in heaven.  My memories of her will always be with me.
B00DP94Z2W|3.0|first i'm a BIG Jason Newstead fan he is solid from fltsam to vio-vod(which I believe he brought back to life F***yea!!)his work is normally top notch driving ozzy old ass to new life after years of boring!! this is nothing new or very original sounding to me Jason should have and could have done much more and much sooner.I hear he was doing project,touring,writing and surgery but he should have came out swinging in 2002-04 showing he WAS the energy in Metallica and the youth still at 40? Rob was good in ST but Jason remade Metallica juiced it up live better that he was allowed in the studio recording-and justice was godly but it need ed a bass player not 4 guitar parts and bass doubling the guitar riffs.Everyone know what I 'm saying but Jason needed to pull a metallica level not clone  LEVEL  sound and cd out to stuff james and the rest some thing great this is not it sub-pare! I wanted a lot more something I could say that's what metallica miss out on or maybe old school flotsam & jetsam feel but not rehashed just hard!it's not in this sounds like a young bands demo that had nothing to show,sadly.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Don't hate  the game because it's not perfect but it AWESOME at least!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PS I'm crazy for minecraft.I love this.I love this.I love this thing.
076115728X|5.0|My son wants to be an artist. This book was perfect for him. We just read it, again, tonight. It's really fun to look through, and is inspirational to my budding artist.
B002KKCVUA|5.0|You can't go wrong when ordering Teva's.  My last pair lasted many years and I expect these will do the same.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved it.  Highly recommended!  You will get pulled in and won't want to put it down.  Definitely a good read.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The EF File Explorer software does exactly what it claims to do.  It's easy to install and the support documentation is accurate.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Classic Tina fey. If you like mean girls, you will like this book. Liked the insight of snl and 30 rock
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bingo is fun and challenging. You have many rooms to complete for rewards.  The rooms just keep coming.  It would be nice if after so many wins you were able to complete the room.
B000GKW4I0|5.0|Rather pricey but it was a gift for someone dear to me so --- that being said; the only thing that was weird was the shipping route! Now THAT was ridiculous! It left California, came all the way over to the east coast only to be turned around, shipped back to end up in Seattle Washington! Why it couldn't just go from California straight to Washington [State] is so far beyond me I'll never be able to understand it. That's like going around your elbow to get to your thumb!<br />BUT ---Once it got to it's final destination the recipient was very happy with it!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I fun game to play. I have used it to entertain Grandchildren. I sometimes play it to unwind after work. Lots of fun.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Try it out, smile, have fun and feel gratitude in the end. Will re-read it many times and will recommend to my friends.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Was boring. Took a long time for the movie to get started. It took 2 days to finish cause I kept falling asleep on it.
B000BISBDY|5.0|I love music---I loved him---winning combination because I love this album! It's everything you ever knew if you grew up listening to Johnny Cash. If you liked his song back then, then this is a great choice for now.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoyed it the first time I played it and I still enjoy playing it. A fum game to play
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, which, for me, was a new King experience--no possessed cars or rabid dogs.  Instead, King gives us a glimpse into what might happen if one is able to change events in the past and the butterfly effect that occurs when even the smallest detail is altered.  There were parts that dragged, though.  I found myself going days at a time without reading because of the lull the story line, and it took me 3 months to finish the book.  It may have been just as effective (or more so) in a briefer version--but, like a moth to a flame, I did keep going back to it, and I'm glad I did.
B00DB624GS|3.0|Five stars for this classic album, but only three for sound quality on this \\"deluxe\\" edition. I'm glad to have the original UK version, properly issued with good liner notes for a reasonable price. And the bonus tracks are essential, although Man of the World should have also been included. Despite what some others have posted, though, I hear little if any sonic improvement over the previous CD version. Perhaps the original multi-tracks and master were unavailable. Perhaps the album was poorly recorded in the first place. But I expected much better sound quality from this long-awaited reissue.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It was a great book that leaves you ready for the next. The writing style is captivating and easy to follow
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I really like to play this one because of the progressive nature. It keeps you busy and is easy to understand and get started.
B00821OX98|4.0|For some reason did not watch while it was aired on cable, but have really enjoyed it on Amazon Prime.  It's really nice to view with no commercials and in HD quality.  The storyline has been very entertaining.
B001MTENOC|3.0|Very convincing but I read the author is not totally credible. Have not checked it out myself.<br />thank you much
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Works and looks very nice on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. For two bucks you can not go wrong. Nice to be able to see across a room.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is incredible. Card's skill at storytelling and insight into human motivation make this book more than just a solid work of sci-fi. It easily fits into the category of true &#34;literature&#34; because of its character development, although the prose is sometimes a bit pedestrian (purposefully so--it was written to appeal to a wide audience).
B00881VLCE|5.0|Congratulations on the creation of phenomenal graphics.  The superb quality of fine art and photographic reproduction, coupled<br />with informative trivia and effectively soothing music, elevates<br />this pastime from recreation to &quot;re-creational&quot;.  The sincerity of<br />this praise is validated by my purchase of FOLLOW THE IMPRES-<br />SION.  Thank you for the free introduction.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The perfect escape!<br />Characters are strong. Storyline is well-developed. Costumes and scenery are exceptional...and please...the accents are like melted butter!
1416987118|5.0|This book encourages early readers through repetition and the story is excellent.  Great book.  One of my 5year old's favorite books.
B009O2XY12|2.0|For an audlt this game may prove to be a bit boaring but for 5 & under it's great.  My granddaugther likes it.  You're on your own.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Very moving. A most beautiful rendition of Ms Grandin's grandeur.... I have watched it four times already. Keep introducing my friends to this beautiful narrative.
B00C061I1M|5.0|2013 has been an interesting year. There have only been a couple of albums that got more than a week airplay in my life. This album has not even been out a week & I don't see it being shelved for a while. Valerie has a voice that is so incredibly interesting.  If you like music, good music.....something with soul, buy this.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|We are faciniated with this series.  I wish it wouldn't end, but how much longer could it really go on?
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|I cannot believe the delusion some of you are posting here.<br /><br />I was FORCED to sit through this abortion of media when my friends insisted I see it with them.<br /><br />I contemplated suicide twice and stopped myself from yelling \\"FIRE\\" or \\"He's got a GUN!\\" often.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS TERRIBLE ATROCITY. THIS INSULT TO MOVIE MAKING! THE GREATS ARE ROLLING IN THEIR GRAVES!!!
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|This is by far miles above what Geoff Tate released only a few months ago with his awful atrocity \\"Frequency Unknown\\". This is a brand new start for Queensryche...killer riffs, a singer who can sing and hit high notes (unlike Geoff who can't hit any notes whatsoever). Standouts are the fierce RFO-ish Where Dreams Go To Die, A World Without, a song that would have fit in on the Promised Land album, and In This Light which shows the band being a bit more modern. Truly, this isn't the greatest cd in the world and some of the songs are subpar but overall, the band is back. But what lost a great many points is the sound of this makes my ears bleed. Seriously Century Media, stop with the loudness wars. I emailed the company themselves but with no response (go figure). Unfortunately, the CD won't get a lot of play because of that one issue. But if you can stand listening to white noise, more power to you. Underneath the white noise is a definite good start to the new chapter of Queensryche.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A twisted tale of manipulation and extremes, this book made me change my thoughts about the characters continuously.  Relationships can be complex but Nick and Amy have outdone us all!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|A great game to play and keeps me entertained. Only thing is if you don't or can't spend money then it requires a bit of patience. Other than that it's pretty awesome :) add me!!: d7691d thanks :)
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I've liked Britney's music for a long time, but this is the one Britney album where I like every song on. I docked a star because I think that they made an odd choice for the last song, Why Should I Be Sad on the standard, Outta This World on the Target version, and Get Back on the international edition.  I still enjoy these songs, kinda wish they'd release more of her songs that are kinda personal like Why Should I Be Sad, but that one is a little too sad to end it with, while the other two would be better suited for the first half of the album.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I played slot of matching games, but this is the Best game I ever played!!!  I would recommend for everyone. Easy, time mover!
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Maybe it's because I'm not 40 but this movie was bad.  Was tricked into watching it with the fiancee and she also agreed that it was not worth the rental.  Wish I could get a refund and my time back.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Game looks as if it would be lame but actually it is not!!! You get to dress your monkey up to look goofy afs. Lol I like the game plus it even better when you are bored.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Great movie.  Argo is one of the best written and fimed in the last 20 years.  Affleck's acting and directing increased my opinion of his abilities. It's one of our favorites.
B001VZY4MS|4.0|Back in the day, this music was a well worn LP in my collection. Unfortunately, in reproducing that sound into digital form all quality was lost. Background was loud to the point of drowning out that great music. Aside from horrible quality, I still rated it a 4, as Neil Young is such a great talent and well worth a trip down Memory Lane.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I enjoyed this book, as I enjoy all of Philippa Gregory's novels, but I found it to be somewhat repetitive in narration and anticlimactic. Maybe it is because I'm so familiar with the characters at this point, and my expectations for intrigue and suspense rife in this court cause me to expect more of the same, but I was a bit let down. Still a worthwhile read, though.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Even my husband enjoyed it.  Robert Downey Jr., is awesome, and it was a pleasure to see Gwyneth Paltrow in there too.  On to number 2.
1844488748|5.0|The pictures are lovely and the directions are good.  Such a nice book to look at and enjoy.\2 more words
B00555X8OA|3.0|Anyone wanting to better understand the mental biases we all harbor or the underpinnings of behavioral finance should read this book. However, shame on the authors for not knowing that the correlation coeffcient is bounded between -1 and +1, and not 0 and +1 (please get that corrected in the next edition).
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Incredible show. Very addicting. Well developed characters and great plot development and twists. Great acting--couldnt stop watching not just the season but the whole series
B0032UYFA6|5.0|THE WRITERS TOUCH ON ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF AMERICAN LIFE.  MANY OF US HAVE TO GUESS AT WHAT THE DRUG COUNTER CULTURE MUST BE LIKE AND THIS MAKES YOUR IMAGINATION SOAR!  GREAT ACTING AND THE PACING OF THE STORIES IS SO WELL DONE, EASILY  THE BEST SERIES OF ITS KIND.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great. game<br />puzzles. excellent graphics very good<br />hints keep game moving to prevent frustration<br />story line well thought. out.  some of it a little too dark. for children
148951418X|3.0|I guess it's a good beginners book. I was expecting more. I've had my go pro for about 6 months and figured out on my own more than is in the book.
B00BDSRISA|3.0|Phoenix is one of my favorite bands so I was anxiously awaiting this release. Maybe I hyped it up in my mind too much but it wasn't as good as I hoped. It seems to meander all over the place...... And when they hit those blissful spots they seem to end too soon sort of like an afterthought (like the gorgeous melody that seems to be thrown in at the end of track 7 for instance). I've heard this ones a major grower not a shower... But I'm still waiting for it to grow on me. Admittedly some of my favorite albums of all time were growers... Fingers crossed
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this games so much, that sometimes I can't wait to get home from work just to play it! But I wish there were more than just \\"17\\" free chips per day.
034580404X|5.0|This triology of a love is written with more depth and visual explanation than any books I have read in a long time.  The feelings that Ana has are so well expressed that you feel what she feels and sees.  Wish there were more writers willing to take the time to develop characters as thoroughly as EL James .  Read these books several times and each time you will  discover more about  Ana and Christain.
1451695195|1.0|I was impressed with the realness aspect of Heaven and God; however there was no reference to the Bible where one could actually learn about the God, Eben learned about.  He conveyed a darkness with grotesque animal faces bubbling out of the muck, and the screeching and chants, which I assume were sort of a hell, but then indicated since he was lifted out of this by and Angelic women that most everyone would also be lifted out of this hell into a Heaven.  He indicated by praying or meditating one could have this Heaven he found, in his out of body experience.  I feel his out of body experience though real and a great glimpse of Heaven, needs to have an asterisk.  Read the gospel of John to find out how to reach the wonderful Heaven described by Eben.  I am afraid this book could lead more people to hell instead of heaven.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Enjoying it so far! Cost money though if you're impatient like me! Other than that it's super fun and easy to navigate!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app provides exactly the relaxing sounds I need, whether I am at work or trying to sleep. Lots of options and comes preloaded with some great mixes. I can't recommend it highly enough.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Love Judi Dench.  This is a great little movie.  I loaned it to a coworker. Probably won't get it back, but I'll buy it again.  I definitely appreciated the lack of nudity and rough language.  I definitely recommend it.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Very easy to use. I'm not really much on playing any games on phone, but this is addictive. Very smooth and easy to play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fantastic game and free app makes it even better.  Graphics of the game are awesome.  My grandchild love this game.  I would recommend this to any parent for their children.  I love Amazon!
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|Our grandson loves these Legos we gave him for his birthday. They enable him to create and express his imagination without limits.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is a very fun game and is soooooooo addictive. I highly recommend this game to anyone. Awesome job flip studios
B0017HMF6W|5.0|This classic movie was a wonderful gift for a dear friend. He'd mentioned watching this movie many times in his youth, so was delighted to receive it as a gift.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day yesterday.<br /><br />Good graphics,nice crisp sound,and it's fun!<br /><br />I would recommend this for everyone
B008I43DYU|5.0|I love this calculator, it is so easy to read as the numbers are very large, and also so easy to use.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great.  I have played a couple of different areas and liked all of them.  I recommend it to all those who want to have an enjoyable experience.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I recommend it to young adults who love science fiction and tons of action and many surprises.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|The video and this single are very thought provoking about the intoxication of fame - and this song gets more brilliant with each play.  No matter how you want to discredit Gaga, she is no one's fool.  This is what good music is all about.
0375851569|5.0|These books are for a baby shower gift for my our twin grand babies. They will be perfect to read to them!
B0053O89YM|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better!  My husband got hooked on it now too so I actually ordered this season to get him caught up.
B002WY65VU|5.0|What a great movie - It's just one of those that you have to own because you can watch it over again.  Love it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It took forever to load and then I couldn't get it to turn off easily.  I had to turn my Kindle off every time.  Gave up and deleted it.  Waste of my time.
B001QJUX24|5.0|G. R. E. A. T.  movie and the settings are just phenomenal....get the Blu-Ray version and play it on a large screen tv and it's ALMOST like being on the set....and I'll bet the rock formations. that were filmed in 1956, still look the same today....one thing that rarely ever changes in Monument Valley, Arizona/Utah.....and that's the beauty of the land itself....The movie was considered THE GREATEST AMERICAN WESTERN OF ALL TIME by the American Film Institute in 2008...and THAT, says it ALL!!!!! Buy it...See it.....and enjoy one of America's masterpieces!!!
B004FOA84A|4.0|If you love mysterious games, this game I would recommend. I did have to look at a walkthrough a couple of times.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition.  I got this as a gift for my grand children. While it is a fine kid's movie I found myself getting caught up in the manic of the story also.
B0081336FO|5.0|Since I am a Sherlock Holmes buff, I wasn't sure I would like this.  It is wonderful.  Can't wait for the next season to come out.  Would highly recommend it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a fantastic app to check the charge on your phone quickly amd effectively. It is also neat because you can also see a graph of the charge over time so you can see when you us3d your phone's battery most effectively.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book is a beautifully written memoir of a young woman struggling with her own demons after her mother's death, the collapse of her marriage, and an unfortunate slide into drug use.  She is determined to take control of her life again and begins that long and arduous process by backpacking the mountains from Southern California to the Washington border.  The storytelling is so well done, I can see why this book is a bestseller and is and Oprah's Book Club read.<br /><br />Having done some backpacking myself, I couldn't believe she wasn't dumping half of what she was carrying in her enormously heavy pack from day one, but you don't have to be a hiker to enjoy this book!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun &amp; challenging. My kids love it. They work together to solve the rooms and ask for help when they need it.
B009MYARIK|1.0|She has gone from my favorite author to the most disappointing.<br />These novels seem to have taken no effort. They are no longer funny or intriguing. My laugh out loud go to books are no more. Sad day for women.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|This memoir of Tony Bordain's long career in various roles in kitchens throughout New York City is definitely a must-read for foodies and fans of his tv show \\"No Reservations.\\"
B000000OPZ|5.0|I saw David Coverdale and company in 2008 here in Peru, i was so fan of Whitesnake since 80's im glad to find this &aacute;lbum and Amazon send me to Lima. Thanks
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is really awsome.we have one computer and we have to share it<br />so this is my way of playing minecraft.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have always liked SwiftKey. I just did the update to Cloud. I love the new Dusk theme it looks really cool. Too long of a wait for new themes though.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I read this as a library book and I thought the [[ASIN:B0074VTH2U The Hypnotist's Love Story: A Novel]] was totally wonderful but this book is even better  and I recommend them both.  Both of the books titles are self explanatory but neither convey how excellent  both books are.  I consider myself lucky that there are 3 more books written by Liane Moriarty that I can read.
0399255370|5.0|Wonderful wording and pictures. Very cleaver and well done. We all enjoyed it-  both the adult and the  kids that read it.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Why can't owner of the kindle fire hd get the new update?  I really want it, but it isn't on Amazon
B0019GO5BO|5.0|It was a collection dream. I needed this one to complete that 80s era. The Molly Ringwald time was classic and now my kiddos are getting hooked. An all new generation enjoying some wholesome movies.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|So much fun.  I just can't get enough!  And so pretty too!  I like the different tasks you have to do.  I have learned a lot about what grows on a reef.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|This is a wonderful little (37mm) 21 jewel automatic watch from Seiko with a beige (or tan) dial with easy to read black numerals for hours and minutes. The nylon strap is fairly heavy duty and looks a little bit like a Zulu style strap. It looks great on my small wrist but if you have a larger wrist you might look at the 42mm line from Seiko that adds higher water resistance (100M). For the price this is a great daily wear watch and with a simple change to a Nato or Zulu style band in mixed colors it could be nice for a change of pace from the tan band.
1781162646|4.0|I'll admit that I was not a fan of Stephen King before I read this book. I had read a couple books previously, that honestly didn't do anything for me. After much sway from friends, insisting that I had read all his @bad books\\", I decided to give Mr. King a second chance.<br />I have to say I really liked this book. I really got attached to Jonsey and related to his list and torn feelings. I loved the carnie world and the little town he lived in. As far as the mystery aspect goes I love how the crime part and supernatural part fit together so well. I hadn't excepted to like this book as much as I did but I would be lying if I said that after reading this book I didn't go and purchase more of his books.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Great read........very suspenseful and entertaining.....love the twists and remarkable details. the visions he creates with his descriptions , places me back in time to the stories of my Grandfather
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of what I read about it on the Today Show website book section.  The person raved about how great this book was, how it was a \\"must read\\". I wouldn't say it's a \\"must read\\" - it was good. I had to keep flipping back and forth because the story line became somewhat confusing at times. Three interwoven stories about families and the secrets and lies they keep to protect themselves and their families.<br /><br />I liked the book. It wasn't one where I stayed up all night to read and couldn't put down, but the story was good.<br /><br />Once the husband's secret was out, the story kind of dragged out (IMO). Not to say this was bad, it worked for the storyline but there were a few things that didn't work for me - this is just my opinion. You, dear reader, may enjoy it much more than I.<br /><br />All in all, I did enjoy the book.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great read........very suspenseful and entertaining.....love the twists and remarkable details. the visions he creates with his descriptions , places me back in time to the stories narrative
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|Don't like that the game cannot be played without WiFi. Maybe I missed that somewhere in the description. I don't play it very often.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written storyline. Love the twists to the plot and character development. Definitely a fun series to watch. Enjoy it.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Unfortunately, I read Mr. Hosseini's books expecting another The Kite Runner.  Nothing meets my expectations.  Mr. Hosseini writes a good novel, but I don't think I will read any more of his books until I hear he has written a story as poignant as his first novel.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|A little too heavy on the sadness this season but I still absolutely love this show.<br />I would like a happier season four.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun and very addicting!  You don't always win but the challenge of getting the hard to get collection pieces keeps me coming back
B005R32L66|4.0|Has been useful with video chatting with family that also have Skype.  A little tricky getting the<br />camera to work on both ends but running fine now.
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|I had not heard of this piano player before.  He was featured on the radio program &#34;Jazz After Hours.&#34;  I was interested in his technique and look forward with anticipation to his other contributions to his repertoire.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|It is Tough to navigate through various segments an departments of ebay, motors, your purchases, your bids, watch list, etc.
2070364232|2.0|The book I ordered said: &#34;Condition: Used - Acceptable  Sold by: texttextbook&#34;<br /><br />But the notes that came in my email request to review this said:<br />Seller note: Student Edition. Missing up to 10 pages. Heavy wrinkling from liquid damage. Does not affect the text. Heavy wear, wrinkling, creasing, Curling or tears on the cover and spine May be missing front or back cover. May have used stickers or residue. Poor binding causing loose and torn pages. Heavy writing, highlighting and marker. All of our books are Legally copy righted US student editions.<br /><br />When I checked back through my order I cannot find this more accurate sellers note anywhere.  It's just for a book club thing and you get what you pay for, so I'll make due, but it's all held together with a rubber band since so many pages are falling out.
1881273156|5.0|I first heard about this book from a friend of mine so I decided to google it.  Dr. Chapman has a website that enables you to take a quiz so that you can determine just exactly what your love language is.  Now to the book.  Dr. Chapman has come up with some very interesting observations that have brought healing to thousands of marriages and hundred of thousands of lives.  I never really thought about having a Love Language that I speak but after reading this book I realized that he hit the nail right on the head.  Now that my wife and I know that what our languages are we have worked very hard at meeting those needs.  This book should be a required reading for anyone contemplating marriage or are celebrating their 70th Anniversary.  This is a book for everyone.  Now I have to buy &#34;The Languages of Apology&#34;.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I missed this series years ago. It one of the best ever police shows. Great cast and realistic stories. It shows the underbelly of urban society. It signals the downfall of the big cities. Everyone that can move out of cities like LA, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and NYC are doing so. Thanks for the memories and thanks for a show like The Shield for exposing big city slime.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved all the twists and turns, along with the surprise ending!  They both got what they deserved ;)<br /><br />Thanks Ms. Flynn for a great read!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|With all of the blowhards in politics that are responsible for wars, it is certainly refreshing to read about a real red blooded patriot. Chris was Young man from Texas that loved his country and his countrymen, yes even politicians. All he ever wanted to is defend his country. He was responsible over 160 kills as a sniper and many more as a navy seal. He was proud of every kill because each one was a threat to the United States of America. He was a mans man unlike the Hollywood types that portray our heroes.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I could barely make it through this one. I was highly disappointed.  If only I'd paid attention to the brief time it stayed in theatres - if it actually made it - and I would have known the reason.  I had been awfully busy around the release time and hadn't kept up with reviews so I was in the dark about just how bad this movie is. Bad story line, bad plot, bad acting. Must have been a filler...
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|So visually appealing -- and the actresses are amazing and I hate to say it but I love Tom Cruise.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like it this game is fun and full of obstacles. For any age, this game is fun. I think that it's a little to expensive to get anywhere
B002AKPECW|5.0|One of the best SF books I have ever read, I would put it in the same category as the works of Asimov or Heinlein. This has everything - robots, fantastically long lived humans, incredible space ships, clones, space battles, &#34;weird&#34; cultures, you name it - a literal smorgasbord of sci-fi stuff. There was even a little romance...not too much though. If I had to say anything negative - and this is a stretch - is that the ending left me wanting more. Overall extremely satisfying and way way above everything  else I have read in the past year in this genre.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Product in shape as I ordered cover an dvd in great shape.I was very supprised at the action and acting in this movie.It was better then I expected. Most comic book movies are just that comic book style but this movie had a good story line,comedy and great action shots. The special effects were great.I would watch this again. I hope the follow up movies are just as good.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I just started reading Stephen King. \\"IT\\" was the second book I've read after \\"Salem' s lot\\". I am completely in love with his writing. IT is such a powerful story, I was locked in instantly and obsessed til the very end. The characters are so engrossing I didn't want it to be over. The power of friendship and all the aspects of childhood and growing up plus It scared me to my core are what made this one of my favorite books to date. If you wanna be frightened to the brink of hysteria read It!
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Product was in good shape and played good. The movie its self was another die hard movie but with a lot more action sceens.Some of the stunts are unreal they are really great.I couldnt stop watching for fear I would miss something the comedy is good.
140006922X|5.0|Zealot gives a good, comprehensive description of what life was like in the middle east at that time.  It was good to have more than one source describing the relationship between the Jews and Romans.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|Perfect for the kids. I always loved Hercules movie. My daughter is 2 and she would not take her eyes off of the movie. Kids need these type of movies back.
B00005JKC3|5.0|My son has been on a super hero kick and we had already gotten The Incredible Hulk and realized that one is a squeal to this one. A great addition to our super hero collection.
B009MO5960|4.0|not the best in the series but fits in the  series ok. action is good but gets overbearing at times.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|great blue ray am very happy with it and would tell everyone to buy one. wish i could buy more stuff this seller rocks
B0000CFW87|5.0|Love this CD, just what I had hoped for!<br />Cannot wait to download it on my iPod, run with it or just chill...
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Love Story betwen two teens.  The story develops into her boyfriend finding out who she really is and what she and her family are.  Very Cliche but entertaining.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Love the series.  They have great story lines and the music picked is awesome.  Great job vocals.  Can watch over and over.
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|So not to spoil it, destro and the other guy are back for revenge.  Do they get it?  Well you will have to watch.  Has Bruce Willis, doesn't every movie now.  It was entertaining.  I certainly wouldn't buy it but rent it.  Good watch.  Clean holusm fun.
1936719118|5.0|Read on one sitting, thank God for the invention of those little post it notes I can use as book marks.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It has some great graphics, good turns and twists on the story we all know and love.  Very entertaining however good as a rental vs buying it.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I &#34;wolfed down&#34; the first three books. The 4th and 5th are boring me. It is all too clear that the writer is adding water to the soup, to keep his creature alive forever.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|My name is....what.....my name is.....what?  Mr Matthew plays a rogue, transient who grew up in that part of the woods.  In love he will do anything for his sweethart.  The movie is mostly about him and these two boys that discover a boat.  It mostly is about the relationship he forms with these two boys, while he trys to figure out how to re unite with his highschool sweethart while he is on the run from the law.  The boys help him, but when tragedy strikes one of the kids he shows his true colors.
0062255657|4.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a part adult drama and part children horror fantasy. It started with a nearly middle aged man going over to his childhood home and then found himself at a farmhouse with a pond he remembered being called an Ocean. He remembered the time he was seven and started to reminiscing on the things he had forgotten.<br /><br />I've been reading The Ice Palace which was frankly a perfect novel written by an author in his sixties writing a POV of 11-years old girls perfectly. I can't say this much about Neil Gaiman because his child characters seems older than they seem. I don't think Gaiman could handle innocent and naive well. I kept forgetting the narrator's age but its not a primarily inner-character driven story so I could let it slide.<br /><br />Almost an autobiographical in nature, I however do think this book have the same universe as Neverwhere especially with the mythical elements in this book. Its not hard to draw parallel between Richard and George an Door and Lettie and the parallel between the hidden city like London Below and the hidden secrets in the country. Much of the book seemed to be influenced by employing Tabula rasa much like the Neverwhere's setting. If Hayao Miyazaki would want to work on another fantasy adaptation for his anime movies. I think this novel would find itself the same atmospheric league as Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle and Tales of Earthsea.<br /><br />I've decided for some time that Neil Gaiman's works are best in audiobooks or movie adaptations than reading his actual prose (plus Gaiman does edit it some of the chapters while reading). It does take me a while (several of his books, I mean) to handle his writing style (which tend to go on weird, flat and continuous until you listen to it) but I do think the adaptations of his work work more splendid than just reading them on paper. Plus, you will missed out on the characters's intonation, the accents, the lingo, interactions etc and Gaiman does keep things out of his writings that are hard for him to put in his writings. Normally, reading this book would get a 3-star from me but the audiobooks does add more to the book. So if you want to read this book and appreciate its content more, you better get the whole audiobook and listen as Gaiman tell you his story in his own words.keep things out of his writings that are hard for him to put in his writings.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game! My 4 year old loves the movies and loves this game. Warning though, it is addictive! You'll have a hard time putting it down.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I am a fan of Nalini Singh and have read all of the books in this series.  I enjoyed this book, although it wasn't my favorite.  My all time favorite is still Slave to Sensation with Kiss of Snow and Play of Passion.
B000FGGE7C|5.0|I watch this one over and over again if for nothing more than watching Milla Jovovich at her young self best. Really fun effects. Total fantasy.
B009POHHPS|5.0|If you like comics, you MUST read this book, it's a very good read, this book will be a classic
B000TGJ80I|5.0|Kate Beckinsale is simply one of the lovliest women in the world. I can't take my eyes off of her. And my wife notices. The neoprene suit only makes my attention more eXtreme. The action is fantastic and the story line is addictive. I wait patiently for the next sequel.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|The storyline seemed to go be the same stuff over and over and unfortunately I lost interest in parts so it was a bit disappointing
B00ECU2SGS|1.0|It's rare I don't finish a movie. My wife an I both fell asleep. What a snooze. The only possibly interesting character was the kid, and they only had him going to and from the island, over and over again. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|not as fun as the angry birds so lost interest in playing pretty quickly unfortunately so do not play anymore
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|kept me pretty busy when I was bored or waiting for something, you can dress up as goku too! fun game.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|pretty much fun like all the angry birds games but I finally reached my limit on the angry birds games
B0000AXE8I|5.0|A mindblowing Adventure into the amazing imagined World that the Matrix created for us to enjoy.  This is not part 2, but rather part 1 of a STORY now set in this World, created out of the writer's minds and EXPLAINED in the Original movie.  I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND you watch the first movie first--you'd be clueless without it.  I'd say even if you've seen the original, see it again to make sure you understand all the rules/concepts of the World in this movie.<br />  Watch this one and if you like it, get Matrix Revolutions; Reloaded and Revolutions are just one long story spit into two 2 hour 15 minute-ish  parts.  People refer to it as a Trilogy but really the 1st movie stands alone; once you've created that world with it's Sci-Fi rules, concepts, people/machines etc.... Reloaded and Revolutions tell a story all of their own.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|This book definitely opened my eyes even further to the new industrial revolution taking place in America. Additionally, I jumped in on two of the 3d printing stocks as I finally fully understood what this technology has the potential to do ... and am very happy with that decision :)
B004EWFUQY|4.0|This is very easy to follow once you get in the swing of things.  Attack phase is a bit difficult at first, but just remember that it is short!  The only downside so far:  I miss eating more fruit!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love search and find games. This is a little difficult but if you pay close attention to the clues you will be fine.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a fun bingo game.  The challenges are complex enough to keep you interested. You move up as you acquire items and win more money<br />  I rush each morning to play this!  With BIngo and slots, you can never go wrong!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|In a word, this was an engaging book.  I would have enjoyed a little more character and story development, though - when all was said and done it felt like a very ripe fairy tale.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is fun. But I have games like Zombie Road Trip that are similar but better, too. Its fun, and it IS free, but honestly you'd probably be better with Zombie Road Trip. Flash is pretty awesome, though. Get Flash ASAP if you get this game.
0930073193|2.0|This book is very well written. Chapters are short and go straight to the point.<br />However, it is very dogmatic. The whole thing is based on the assumption that minimal government and free trade will improve people's rights, increase their purchasing power and encourage entrepreneurial-ism.<br />The author only focuses on Libertarian concepts and fully ignores the reasoning behind higher tax, public spending and regulatory and supervisory structures.<br />Also, there are a lot of wrong assumptions in that book which make the author's point very unfair and unbalanced.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Best Thermal Compound!  It works great on the computers I rebuild.  Buy it from Amazon, they have the best price.  If you go to your local stores, you'll end up paying twice as much.  It works!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it runs well on the fire. the minions are so cute. I love to be despicable while eating the bananas. the trouble with the game is that you want to keep going and you don't get anything else done.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Yet another mahjong game. Decent game but it is still mahjong. Too many mahjong games are available we really don't need any more.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I loved this movie. My heart was pounding & it made me SO, SO THANKFUL for the Men & Women who serve & defend us & our country!!!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I was not too impressed with the movie. The trailers were really exciting and I was looking forward to watch the movie but other than the effect I found the way the story was placed, boring.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|The levels are great... I can beat level on with my eyes closed and then I can't beat the last level and a few before that... good challenge.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Relaxing yet challenging. Very enjoyable with wonderful graphics. Waiting for future puzzles! For young and old. This will make you take time to think. Worth the download. Just when you've almost given up, something comes along to help move you to the next level.
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|But you kinda have to like this type of game.... and even though it is different I am Tetris-ed out (game style)
030746363X|5.0|Great stuff. Try it, you'll like it. Be your own Guinea pig. I feel great and have never slept better...
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I just received this tonight and had it working within seconds.  Once plugged into my computer and the ethernet cable, I did have to reboot my computer because everything was frozen.  But instantly worked upon reboot.<br /><br />I went from frustrating, agonizing slow and unpredictable wireless connection to a blazing fast ethernet connection.  My MacBook Air internet is now faster than the PC previously using this same ethernet outlet/cord.  Very pleased!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game is very addicting but gives little pleasure because obtaining the objects neededto complete rooms are almost impossable to win. Also there are a LOT of bugs that are very annoying and interrupt play! There is no satisfying reply from customer support when bugs are reported either. The replies are sort of \\"we know about it \\" but no effort to replace lost credits unless u paid cash for the credits. So love the game but the many problems are making me consider bagging the game.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I enjoy scifi and this book/story looked good so I gave it a try... so far it's a great story, I find myself really wanting to make time to read it.  I'm sure I will purchase the other follow on books as well.
0312323867|5.0|this book is awesome. i had so much fun reading it. wish they also made a movie. now can't wait to read the rest of Emily G's books!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This game is very addicting. I love the gem matching games and this one is my favorite! Not only do you match up like tiles you you get to build beautiful themed fish tanks. I would reccomend to anyone who like bejeweled, jewl quest, and like games. ENJOY!
0064471837|5.0|I picked up a copy of this book at a used shoppe and I am so glad I did. From the first few pages, I was hooked. The character builds and story were something that I couldn't forget. The writing was so vivid that I felt I was an observer of the story just a few feet from the characters. Amazing. I have since then passed it around to my mates. They too found the story amazing. The book is well paced and exciting at every turn. Learning about all the characters as they are introduced and having small twists to keep everything exciting. One of my favourite authors. Recommended read.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Too much going on in this app. I just want to pull up the forecast for the next few days and plan my week. I shouldn't have to clck through 4 pages to get to the forecast. Old app was much better.
B00785P2QC|4.0|ok I just started playing it.  I really like the game so far.  hats all the rb and twitter stuff but the game play is really good.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I found this book on a bargain kindle books news feed and decided to download it just to see if it was as intriguing as the reviews made it out to be. I was not disappointed. I found myself wincing at the many scrapes the protagonist kept getting himself into, but his decency and refusal to back down even in the midst of so many trials and tribulations kept me reading. I am developing a special affection for this main character, an that hasn't actually happened to me in a very long time.<br /><br />One thing I did notice was the fact that at the beginning of the book there are two suns. As the book continued, however, I noticed that only one was mentioned. What happened to the second one? It's a very picky thing, but I'm like that sometimes. I also found myself wondering what will happen in the next book. I hate cliffhangers!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants something light, yet action packed an emotionally charged to read on a long flight or commute.
B003WUYQSW|4.0|Great read, I'm just a little late to getting around to it. A lot of what Gary writes about is still very relevant in 2013.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not a zombie fan so it is very odd that I enjoy this show as much as I do. There is a little bit of everything. Love, loss, will, zombies, gore!  It's so good. I can't stop watching!  Can't wait for season 4!!
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Purchased this for my husband, and he simply loves her music.<br />It is so different, no screaming, just a perfect voice.  She was<br />a singer, who left too soon.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I really want this kind of pill. I really liked the storyline and the characters.<br /><br />I recommend it, is a very original story.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Should have read the specs little closer.<br />I was able to connect with my Nexus 7 okay after changing a setting on my router.<br />However, this will not:<br />Broadcast Amazon Prime content.<br />Play sideloaded content.<br />View games on the TV that I play on my Nexus.<br />After those 3 strikes I gave up on the thing.<br />It also requires a wireless network to connect to.<br />When I removed it from my TV it was almost too hot to handle.<br />Will be sending it back for a refund.<br />Very dissappointed in what looked like a promising piece of technology.
B0041G67YW|2.0|Everything's perfect!.. only that a big HUGE fail!!.. the cover of the DVD says &#34;Directotor&#34; instead of &#34;Director&#34; it's mispelled :(
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I use this adapter because I use android and the gf uses apple.  The product charges both well (AC rate? untested but def as fast as a wall wart).  Works with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus and Apple Iphone 5.  It works well in the car and with a battery.  I have a small lithium ion 10 ah 12 v cctv battery with cigarette adapter and this anker usb charger which charges our phones simultaneous more than enough times!
B0012HQKZE|5.0|This has a great cast and is a thrilling duel between man and beast. Both Alec Baldwin and Anthony Perkins bring their talents to bring this movie alive.......One to add to your collection<br /><br />Mark Shepard<br />Des Moines
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love all mahjong games. I really like how this version rises in difficulty level upon completion of a game.
0066620996|5.0|Excellent read and relevant for all industries. Well written and very insightful. Great gift idea. Buy a new one so you can keep it on your book shelf and look smart;-)
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This is a good movie. It's original, and fun. Lots of twists i didnt see coming, and i watch/read a lot of sci fi. worth a rental if not a buy.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I can't say this is the best book that Charlaine Harris has written, but it had to be summed up somehow. I was happy with the ending and the series of events, but I do wish there was a little more action than mostly just drama.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|The trailer for this movie was akin to Cruise's previous sci-fi work 'Minority Report', but is not on the same level.<br /><br />The story line took long to develop, and the premise is intriguing, but there were lags between.<br /><br />The visuals were okay, but not groundbreaking or innovative.<br /><br />An okay watch for sci-fi buffs......
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Once you start playing you will not want to stop! This bingo app is definitely worth installing! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
B005TQAI6G|5.0|I rated this DVD 5 stars, not because of the actual DVD, but for the sake of the overall tour. As most have already cited, the editing and overall presentation EPIX passed off as the finished version of this DVD is laughable and in the end, damages the nostalgia and any positives the Femme Fatale tour offered. For starters, everybody is aware that Britney though not necessarily incapable of doing so, has not displayed herself as the performer she once was. I say this as a fan and do so not expecting others to follow suit, but I believe Britney has the potential to be every bit the performer she was in her prime. I've read where several statements have been made by other members of her dancers camp saying, in her defense, that Britney is well beyond capable of tearing it up in rehearsals, it's her own issues with her self confidence that lead her astray come show time. Many have come to her defense, claiming her lackluster stage performance comes on the heels of knee injury and 2x over, childbirth. I call BS and do so as a diehard fan. In 2007, a good span of time before her breakdown and forced psychiatric restraint, Britney attempted a comeback of sorts, performing a series of stripped back performances as part of a gig with the House of Blues. At the time, she had not long given birth to her second child, and while not in the best physical shape, she executed nearly flawless choreography reminiscent of that of her pre-breakdown days. The issue with Britney's abilities now comes by her own show of strength. I'm only guessing, but seeing as how Britney still remains under almost total control of her father via conservatorship, her lackluster behavior is as expected. She doesn't feel free and isn't merited to be such on her own, not entirely. The reins have let up some in recent months and judging by what I've seen and heard of her, she's closer to 'real' Britney as she's ever been. Her next album is on it's way and appears to be piggybacking loads of promise. Britney is in control and is doing it the way she wants an important element said to have been missing during the Femme Fatale era. I've read, she was fed up and had become disinterested in the project and the direction it was taking. That transcended to the stage. With that said, the Femme Fatale Tour while not her best, was not represented how it could've been. The videos I watched on YouTube offer an entirely contrasting view than that of Epix's portrayal. It's because of these proofs that the Femme Fatale tour and Britney are not failures, the DVD is just shoddy quality. For those of you borderline giving up on her, be patient, album 8 is coming and is said to be personal out the tail pipe. Britney Spears is not over by a long shot! As far as advising for against buying or not buying the DVD, it's purely your choice. I did before I realized it's errors. It's not perfect, but it's not an utter waste of life either. I recommend checking into the tour on YouTube regardless.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is amazing. Most free games suck, but this on is awesome. You drive and get coins so you can  buy more vehicles and scenes. I must admit it does get harder as you go on. Hill side race is a kiddy game but it's not a game only for genesis. I vote five stars . HOORAY HILLSIDE RACE!!!!!!!!!! :D
B0031SCV46|5.0|An excellent acquisition to add to my home studio.  Amazon is my favorite &#34;Online Vendor&#34;, which makes my shopping experience very satisfying.  M-Audio always make excellent products, and I'll continue using their products.
B0055MBQOM|1.0|I was excited to receive this as I seem to have a display that is not true to the colors from a semi-professional photo lab. The minute I loaded it, everything took on a yellow cast! I was very disappointed and ended up returning the item. Still have yet to find something that will adjust the color display correctly.
B00D3LA71K|3.0|Not for me made a mistake buying this one. I did not like it. I do not recommend it very slow movie.
B008JFUN6E|4.0|Elysium is like a combination of \\"District 9\\", \\"Terminator\\" and<br />\\"Bourne\\" movies all in one.  The hand to hand fight sequences are as good as those in the \\"Bourne\\" movies.  The mood, premise and robots remind me of the \\"Terminator\\" movies.  The settings of villages and towns on earth have a feel like the \\"District 9\\".<br /><br />Take all this and add good special effects, great graphics, good story line and decent acting from Jodie Foster and Matt Damon you have a movie worth seeing.<br /><br />Yes, as someone has pointed out there is definitely a political point being made here in the story.  This story is taking on the present political situation and moving it into the future. There is nothing wrong with that and I would go as far as saying \\"I am glad they made the movie\\".  Good stories quite often have a moral value or lesson to learn or perhaps instruct us on what we should be aware of in our current political environment.  And this is what makes this a good movie.  I suppose as someone pointed out the person portraying \\"Delacourt\\" by Jodie Foster may have a striking resemblance to Hillary Clinton, but it also could be Sara Palin.  However, who ever made the claim is not far off- base. After all Hillary Clinton did say on her website in a bid for running as President for the Democratic Party in 2008, \\"I represent Wall Street\\".  Given all of this to be true you will have some people who will react in a negative sense to the story.  But, it makes me wonder how they would react to movies such as \\"THX 1138\\", \\"1984\\" or the \\"Time Machine\\".  In the story of the \\"Time Machine\\" the Morlocks are capitalist who flee underground with their machines and prey upon the Eloi who are workers that stayed above ground. The first movie with Rod Taylor is close to the book, but the book goes into better detail than what I am explaining. Read the book.<br /><br />In comparing the Elysium's story to the \\"Time Machine\\" I would give it a close 4.  However balancing this out with everything else previously mentioned I would give the whole movie a 4 ½  stars.<br /><br />Go see the movie.  It will be money well forth spent.  Have a great time
B00E8JTSVG|3.0|This  was  a  very  creative  story  that  captured  my  attention.  It  is  about  magic,  mystery  and  fantasy. It  tickled  me  pink  right  up until  the  very  last  line.  well  written.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Almost done with this season. Hasn't fallen short for me! This one is a doozey and in keeping with the past seasons. He hasn't lost his touch. Addicted. A bloody perverted mess as usual.<br />Gimmme more.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Tony the Tiger approves this game. So do I. It's a lot like those tycoon games that every one loves.No need to worry about lack of energy either.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Always the anti hero Harry fights the good fight against bureaucracy and crime. Saved by the skin of his teeth, again, and never with the superficial or expected motive. Always look forward to a &#34;good Harry&#34; read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is really a good app they offer quite a bit for free. I like it and I think you will to but it takes a while to load
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|It's a hidden objects game - can be fun but after hours of play I still can't identify what some of the objects are supposed to look like. I've had to go online to read about cheats to answer many basic questions as well.
B0073QWCAA|4.0|Made for a fun movie marathon that's very repeatable. Great addition to my library. Can hardly wait to see if they come up with another one soon.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|one of the classic western movies from allen ladd and a great cast l love it in regular DVD and now i blu-ray it is terrific i recomend it to lovers of classic westerns good as can be right up there with &#34;the wild bunch&#34;
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is addictive. Its fast past and wakes you up. It takes time to unlock new suits but it is well worth it. All together this game is addictive and fun and it worth paying money for if it wasn't free.
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|a must have blu ray format for all disney's affecionados i am so glad that disney is putting all or most all of this great classics in blu-ray
B001ANYDAO|3.0|The book makes a great point and if you can internalize the point of feeling comfortable being different only to find success because of it later, it's great. Unfortunately the book moves extremely slow and it was difficult for me to remain interested in the numerous statistical examples that make the point. Good point nonetheless.
B002RV01Q8|5.0|A GREAT COMBINTION CD AND DVD IN ONE PACKAGE from such UNIQUE singer a good buy and great bargin from such a wonderful and very good looking woman i juat love it and recomend to great music lovers great artists up there like the &#34;CELTIC WOMEN&#34;

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game you can learn something about it.you should get this app.its additing.everyone should get this app.I'm telling you get it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Very useful when you want to give a personal note to quick messages. It adds that little extra touch to what you're saying.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This is a good read. I liked the stories and the players. I am reading the whole series. There are a few typos in it though.
B000TETLPC|4.0|This album has some really great songs on it. However I find myself skipping a few. I will say with great confidence that Mer De Noms is far superior in comparison, since from start to finish I do not touch the forward button on my player. I think some highlights here would definitely include first and foremost, the opening track. WOW! I must say this is a ridiculously mind blowing track. Maynard executes the vocals with such feeling, whether soft or intense, he delivers the goods. Love the lyrics on it too. Love how it builds, how he starts growling \\"give this to me!! Mine! Mine! Mine!\\" towards the end... well, you'll see what I mean if you don't know yet. :) I really like Weak and Powerless too. Has a oddly familiar sound to possibly something Maynard has done in the past? Blue is a slightly more mainstream sounding track in my opinion, kinda grows on you though. I will say A Stranger is a true gem. I just get still when I listen to it. It has that effect on you. Short and oh so sweet. The Outsider also seems a little reminiscent of something he has done in the past. The Nurse Who Loved Me also grows on you. At fist I just thought it was a depressing somewhat dull version of that song but it actually grows sweeter with each listen. Pet is a somewhat lyrically disturbing song, heavy and really sad if you listen to the lyrics. But I really enjoy the guitar work on those riffs. Overall, I am happy that I got it but in no way does this album compare to their fist album as a whole. By the way, does anybody else miss the strings that were so fluidly streaming through most of the tracks on Mer De Noms??? I had really hoped when I first bought this album that those sounds would also be a part of it. Not so, to my utter dismay.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|This was hard to stream on my iPad, it was very choppy and the sound was off. However once the issues were resolved I very much enjoyed this show. So an overall thumbs up here.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I started by watching the show but the books are better by far. There is so much more in the book that could not fit in the show and I liked how in depth the characters got. EXCELLENT!
B004RL9T50|5.0|This was a great movie, I ordered it for my little sister and ended up watching it with her. It is enjoyable for all ages, and the price was very reasonable. Overall I'd recommend it.
B007SGM084|5.0|It showed how love can change even the largest kink in an individual. One may think they are an Island imovible and without base till the love a great woman and the sight and sound that their love produces. This book made me more attentive to the needs of my loving and endearing wife. True it is a far fetch fro reality but I think many can realate to some of the disfunctioalism of Christian and we all should be lucky enough to have an Anasasia who in spite of her love for Christian she will not take his crap. Loved it All.
0553801473|5.0|I waited so long, so so very long for this book.  When I arrived I felt lightheaded and had to sit down and hug it a bit.  Anyway, it's song of ice and fire, you know the score: violent, vivid and the return of favorite characters and some reshuffling of the pieces of the gameboard.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's frigging awesome and hilarious and adorable too. Minnions are the bomb even if it is just a relic of temple run it is still cool. And the best part it' free!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the most awesome app ever! I play it everyday . You should buy it. Just tap the orange button at the top! Simple! don't forget to get the updates too!!! ;-)
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Gorgeous description woven into a spellbinding narrative. Characters you have to invest in populate this magical confection created by Erin Morgenstern.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not your usual object search game. This game adds a new spin to the game as you have incorporated hidden objects in order to solve clues that help you find your way out.  Enjoyed the fact that you had to think outside the box and determine how the hidden objects are to be used to solve your clues. Wish for more levels.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Baker-Kline shares the story of hundreds of children in America's past.  This is a bit of history that I'd never learned. Not everything has a perfect ending, but it's all the more real for that.  It's not a biography of any one child, but the characters run true and the premise of Orphan Train is historical fact.  A bit of Americana that we can all enjoy.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I love Quell. It really makes you think! It's a perfect game to pass the time at airports, in doctor's offices, or just relaxing. Perfect.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Alison Krauss is among the greatest musicians of our time.  This collection is marvelous and can be listened too endlessly.
B008133MDK|5.0|Holy cow I was told to watch this series by my niece and as usual she was right. It is GREAT! The acting is perfect and the writing is perfect and the stories are perfect!<br />LOVE!
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I'd actually seen this movie once before.  It stars Christian Bale (this movie was actually the deciding factor for casting him in the Batman movies).<br /><br />It is set in the future after WWIII.  Only unlike most movies where the world looks like a big junk yard, 2 distinct societies have arisen.  One lives in large, well maintained cities and the other is outside the cities just scraping by (however, some people may not be happy with this but they are just people...no zombies or disfigured mutants),<br /><br />Within the cities it is against the law to openly express emotions and children are even schooled (a.k.a., brainwashed) to believe that it was mans' emotions that let to world war 3.  So emotions and things that lead to their expression like art, music, etc. are outlawed.  If you are found with it they do take it to a little extreme...you are put in a furnace and burned alive.<br /><br />There is a special police force that has been created.  The people who live in the emotionless cities (at least they are supposed to be) can't even have things like a frame around a picture.  Which makes sense in a way since you aren't supposed to have pictures (again, of an artistic nature...like paintings).<br /><br />The special police are highly trained in &#34;flushing&#34; suspected people out as there are many pockets of people within the city walls who have hidden stashes of art, music, books - all from the pre-war days in various places.  These special police are referred to as &#34;clerics&#34; but are basically adults who, from childhood are taught to be emotionless, trained with highly developed fighting skills (and the fight scenes are some of the best choreographed I've ever seen in a movie) and are given a drug that must be taken every day to help suppress their emotions.  Anyone want to guess what the drug is called...okay, time's up...the drug is called Equilibrium.<br /><br />BTW, nothing that I've written to this point is a spoiler and I'll try not to give any. So, now I'll get a lot more general so as not to give anything away because if you like post-apocalyptic movies, movies with good fight scenes and surprise, movies that have a plot, you'll like this movie.  It is well paced and I think one of Christian Bale's better works.<br /><br />The people outside the cities are considered radicals because they are also ones who stash art, etc.  So the Clerics (along with regularly trained soldiers) do make trips outside the cities as well. Since sense-inducing things like poetry and music are illegal they try to find it anywhere and when they do the soldiers torch works of art and the like.<br /><br />Of course there has to be some personal conflict somewhere or there wouldn't be a movie.  Enter Christian Bale as more than just the Cleric orders number 1 Cleric (a.k.a., highly skilled killer) since the people who love those sentimental things are supposed to be eradicated so they don't spread those heretic ways around.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />Christian Bale's partner, another Cleric, it seems has stopped taking his Equilibrium (that drug that suppresses emotion.  But to set up a conflict for Mr. Bale, his Cleric partner is discovered (anyone remember what the term &#34;red shirt&#34; from the original Star Trek TV series and what that implied would happen if you were chosen for a landing party...in short, once you materialized on a planet if your uniform had a red shirt you probably wouldn't make it to the next commercial...argh).  So once Christian Bale's partner is found to have developed emotion, well you can probably guess what happens to him and Christian Bale is the one who has to do it.<br /><br />I will leave it at this point because from there on Christian goes through many changes which causes a lot of action, shooting, really well choreographed fight seems and finding out who and what makes for a good person or bad, while a lack of emotion creates a society without everyone killing each other, no bank robberies or robberies of any kind...it begs the question is giving up emotion (what makes us human) worth giving up?<br /><br />Well, this movie tries to show you using and action packed drama.  So enjoy.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Even though I am thoroughly frustrated by the final episode, I still have to give five stars. The relationships between the characters and the fabulous dialog is reason enough.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Well at first It was good but then it started to add words that were really hard<br />But on the other hand it was ok
1451697686|5.0|Great beginner book for those who care about the environment.<br />Doesn't delve into the nitty gritty to get rid of plastic use or excess production of objects.<br />But my niece who lives in a hay bale house, green waste goes to the goats and chickens, makes cheese and yogurt from their milk, etc., thought this book was great for most Americans.<br />My niece kept saying,&#34;Baby steps, it takes baby steps to change humans with habits.<br />So, for a primer this book is fantastic.<br />Now lets get all Americans to read it.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|What I find really fantastic about this book is that while it tells the thrilling story of a race, with little digression it also introduces the basics of the history and science of long distance running. Sounds tedious? Not at all. It reads itself like a bestselling crime story, even if you are not a runner yourself.
030789701X|5.0|IT GOES WITH THE GAME SKYRIM AND ITS A COLLECTOR'S EDITION. WITH MAPS AND PICTURES TO. AND LOTS OF WORDS TO READ
B0036EH3U2|5.0|After watching this fantastic series on TV in Standard Definition on crappy Comcast Cable, re-watching it on Blu-ray in High Definition is like discovering the best show on television all over again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|a must have. Got all 3 books and cant wait to watch the movie. Quick dl too. easy to use for cp use
1607744104|5.0|An update over the previous version of the book.  This is great for beginners and experienced gardeners/collectors.  In an area where hands on experience is vital, this book will surely save one some grief of needlessly losing a plant.
B0016OOS16|5.0|This thing works 100% of the time with Autodesk and UGS/Siemens applications.  Very contact, rugged, and affordable.  Have one at work and home.  Highly recommend this 3D mouse if you are a regular CAD user.
0812982622|5.0|I finished this book this morning.  I sat quitely for about 5 minutes, and then started to read it again from the first page.<br />I had hoped I would learn somrthing about North Korea.  And then, I hoped what I was reading couldn't be true.  Adam Johnson's story is like a complex, amazing tapestry that weaves a picture that is horrifying, beautiful, desperate, hopeful, and consuming.  This is an important book and I know it will haunt me for a very long time.<br />Thank you Mr. Johnson.
