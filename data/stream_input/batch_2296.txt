B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie deserved the Academy Award!  The cinematography was beautiful - I think it also won an award.  I would recommend it to everyone.
1402775458|5.0|The artwork really is beautiful and compelling. The story is as wonderful as any cheap, worn paperback version of the same book - but the artwork really makes this edition a treasure.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Really liked this one immensely.  Did not like Ben's facial hair - lol - guess it fit the part.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B00C0OOV5O|1.0|I could deal with the drama in this show if they would just spit it out. Oh no they have to have huge dramatic pauses. I payed for a show, not a long drawn out pile of steaming boredom. If you are looking for something that is called action sci-fi, move along to something with at least some plot progression.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I only have a short review as I shut it down after fifteen minutes and downloaded Argo.  When checking reviews next day found it was a theatrical version - should have done this first. Awful, awful, awful!
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I\\"BECAUSE I CAN\\"  say this is a great record, in fact be happy its not a record like \\"The Circle\\" which had only in my opinion 4 great songs....This record has great emotion and reminds me of a cross between KEEP THE FAITH and HAVE A NICE DAY with a flavor of LOST HIGHWAY.....I dont know why you say it lacks energy maybe because this record is \\"ALL HEART\\" and it is very emotional at times!  I give it a 5 out of 5 Stars!  By the way What About Now is NUMBER #1 on the Billboard Charts! US Bon Jovi Fans are a \\"ARMY OF ONE\\"!
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Simple for all. A good read for someone getting started with the Raspberry Pi's. I purchased the Kindle version but sure paperback is equally good.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Fun movie to watch. Great quality film. I have given this CD as a gift and I happen to know that it has been watched on several occasions.
B007REV4T8|2.0|Certainly not the worst Bond movie ever, but certainly not the best. After teasing us by building an intense chase scene followed by one of the best Bond songs in a very long time, the movie descends into averageness with its garden variety revenge plot. As an action movie, Skyfall fails; after the first action sequence, action scenes are few and far in between, not to mention short and unimaginative. For example, the fact that Bond's gun is palm-print activated barely comes into play. Even the climactic battle is snoozer; what, Bond is going to make a Jason Bourne-like final stand in the castle he grew up in? We're not even given enough time to process this information for it to carry the necessary emotional impact. So, I really don't know who is writing the reviews that say this movie is action packed. But Skyfall also fails as a Bond movie. We have to face the fact that the gadgets are never coming back for this Bond, that this Bond's sexual prowess will henceforth be visually neutered for the sake of a PG-13 rating, and that Craig is starting to look too old for this assignment. On a positive note or two, Javier Bardem did a decent job being a just-under an over-the-top villain (sadly, he doesn't show up until half-way through the movie). The new Q is promising as well. Other than that, I cannot recommend this movie. You're better off spying something else, which would be more spying than takes place in this flick.
B004ZNB12O|3.0|Not the greatest CD ever - I listened to it a couple of times and then gave it to someone who actually liked Pink Floyd.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is like having a real hore u have to take care of. lots of fun and works great with kindle fire.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game for everyone.enjoy playing this game it is very challenging to play but good for you mind and heart rate.
B005XDHNF4|5.0|These little legos are too cute! I love that you can change the hair color and flower colors. They will make the perfect topper for our groom's cake.
B004VOBIE8|2.0|Do n o t think I need.<br />At this present time and moment. I may need it later.<br />I do not know for certain a this particular moment.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that subway suffers is really fun. My friends and I play it all the time but the one problem is that ounce I start I cant stop.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This to me was an interesting story line -with many twists.<br /><br />It did cover its title &#34;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&#34; in a very clever way.  The development of<br />the characters --and casting was to me outstanding.<br /><br />Timely transaction.
B000UZPIAW|4.0|Great book!  very interesting to view everything from his and his friends, lovers, etc. point of view. Very honest book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed the book, couldn't put it down. Liked the story and can't wait to read the next book of the series.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I use this app everyday.  Have time on my hands right now so use my kindle slot.  With this app there are no low power surprises when it is inconvenient to recharge.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|&#34;Good, Bad, I'm the guy with the gun.&#34;  Best B rated movie ever featuring the best B rated actor ever.  What more do you want?
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I read the books before I saw the show, and Im impressed at how closely it follows the book story line.  Not much is changed or left out.  All the important information is incorporated into the show.  There is so much background history that it creates a very intriguing world, and keeps you hooked.<br /><br />A definite must have.
B005HSL626|5.0|ok so this is my favorite game of all....really so much fun to play would recommend this to anyone to download
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|A really great read. The story was so detailed. I smiled,cried,laughed, and my heart warmed throughout reading this story. I didn't like the ending, because I thought it was too predictable. Overall a great book.
B008B92U32|3.0|I have never played this one. I just downloaded it because it was the free app of the day. I guess give it a try.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Easy to start slow and progress. First workout was great for just getting back into working out, but you feel worked out, and then you can progress. Love this work out video.
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|I have never played this one. I just downloaded it because it was the free app of the day. I guess give it a try.
B00464F19Q|5.0|If you want a great crime drama, watch this movie!  While it won't keep you guessing, the killer's method of madness leaves you questioning who is in the right.  This movie is a great intellectual stimulus into the wonders of humanity.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Well done and eye opening coverage of the hunt for Bin Laden.  An unflinching look at the tactics and politics involved.  Liked it more than I thought and torture scenes were not gratuitous.
B002APU580|5.0|This movie has been my personal favorite for years.  I can watch it again and again and never get bored with it.  Every time I watch it, I pick up on new details that I missed before.  It's a wonderful romance for any romantic!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I did not read the book but now would like to have more detail although the film is very good and never gets too sentimental.  Love the twist at the end where you are not sure what really happened.
B002BWCJOA|4.0|My daughter loves this movie.  While it does have a unique storyline, I'm just not a personal fan of these types of movies.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Omg best book ever!! I really hope they make this a movie!! Nicolas sparks who? Colleen Hoover is amazing. I could this over and over. Love will and lame <3
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|I thought this movie would at least give me a few jumping surprises, but it did not.  In my opinion, it is the worst PA movie yet.  The producers of this film series need to quit as each movie seems worst than the last.
0596009208|4.0|One of the best Text books I have used to learn a computer language from ground zero. Java was the second Object orented language that I learned.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I loved this movie, but my two daughters didn't like it as much as I did.  Usually when they see a new movie, they watch it over and over again.  After watching this one, they happily allowed the rental period to expire.  Maybe it's the Viking lifestyle that they didn't like...
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Actually, I love &#34;The Following.&#34;  However, I would like to add that other sites that show streaming video allow you to go to FULL SCREEN mode, and Amazon apparently does not.<br /><br />This is something you should address, because it makes quite a difference.  Also, the last evaluation was for the particular show and episode.  This categorizing it as a &#34;product&#34; seems inappropriate.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|I really liked this movie because, while some scenes were dramatized, the creators paid close attention to the accurate details to make this movie as realistically accurate as possible.  If you like action movies, thrillers, or romances, you will love this movie!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was a great read. I really liked the love story and the ease of reading. Although predictable at times, it was exactly what I was looking for in a book- a romantic, easy-read. I really enjoyed the characters and the story line.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My kids have watched this movie hundreds of times in the past two days yet I'm still not sick of it.  It's a great movie for the whole family with a very cute storyline!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Added this to the Kindle to keep track of everything, and that's what it does. Can denote different events by color so they are easy to spot. Easily add and subtract events. You can choose to have holidays listed or not. Special highlights to important events. Do wish there were lunar reference (full moon) days. Yes those in the medical profession, cops and fire/rescue do in fact take that stuff seriously. I'm sure there is more to it than I have discovered. Quite happy for how it works for me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's the Walking Dead, how can you not like it?  I watched these episodes to get me caught up on the series as I missed a few episodes with my DVR.  These episodes quickly got me caught up on the drama unfolding.  I can't wait to get the complete 3rd season!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I really enjoyed this series especially the period costumes and English country side.  I thought the actors did an excellent job in this series and look forward to more from this producer.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|With plenty of excitement, a few spots of laughter, and lots of quirky characters, this movie is a must see for every family!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Hope to have many more books about John Puller. Love the character!  THE FORGOTTEN was just as riveting as this wonderfully written piece of literature
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|its an awesome game, I only wish it came with a couple of free hints,  so I would know how easy they are to use. I have a 6 yr old that kept wanting to buy the hints, but I didn't want to spend any on them, cause they'd be gone in no time! Great game,  and awesome for learning to preservers, even when frustrated!
B0063GORYU|5.0|it passesthe time when you just relaxing and at home...........i love this game  and play everyday for a few hours
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wonderful to have shared in  Cheney's journey toward self discovery. My own journey is yet to start but I'm inspired.
B004GYY714|2.0|i have not used it yet  m m m m m m m m  m  m m m  mm  m
B0001US8EO|4.0|I really like Kevin costner, so this is based on mostly him as the actor.  The movie was pretty good, too.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I am eager to read the next book.  I loved the secret world and how the author told the story.<br />it was exciting and I hated to put it down. Great book.
0767020308|3.0|I thought this version might be a little better than the one with Gweneth Paltrow, but I only gave it 3 stars because the quality of the picture was not that good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Totally consumed with the story line, costumes, and actors. Ability to get this season on Amazon was effortless and allowed us to capture the final two episodes.
B000Z8GZYW|3.0|fun movie, even if a bit dated.  Bill Murray is so deadpan, and he seems like he can't stand the kissing scenes.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|If you're looking for a fairly unique story line to capture your interest about mental illness, you may enjoy this book. The plot and characters are overall well defined and thought out. If constant foul language offends and apalls you as it does me, don't even bother downloading this book. I wish I had not wasted my money. As a christian, this book's deragatory, sacriligous, use of God and Jesus' name in offensive cursing, had me cringing before a 1/4th of way into it. I could not, in good concience, continuing reading. Unfortunately because of the language I will not finish the book nor recommend it to anyone. Such a shame for what could have been a great book.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I really love this movie.  Robert Downey Jr plays his part extremely well.  It is  an almost believable story.  Tops in entertainment
0765325950|5.0|I have been waiting with a lot of others for this book. It brings closure to this wonderful story. The characters have become good friends and I know I will re-read it many times.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I think it is an absolute travesty that this talent was not known in our own country. I am going to down load his albums as soon as possible.
B007WPM7SO|5.0|I love stories set in this period. I enjoy seeing the clothes, hair styles, cars and homes. It's really good for that.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but since I like Clint Eastwood so much I decided I couldn't lose. It was tender and uplifting in Mr. Eastwood own way. I would recommend it
B001KZG99A|5.0|Iron Man's Mask---7th century BC Greek helmet...Coincidence?  I think not.  A wonderful modern day recast of classic tales of Greek heroes.  Downey and Paltrow are like cream and dark chocolate, or a flute and an oboe--they play off each other wonderfully.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Tjis was just a little too juvenile for me, I fell asleep and didn't want to finish. I like Mark Walberg but please this was ridiculous.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This is a skillful, delicate, true-to-life depiction of how memory emerges and is experienced with trauma.  Chbosky honed his voice and message well, from novel to screenplay to directing.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I just wish I had a 3-D TV. I would love to see this on the big screen of a movie theater again. I find myself getting so absorbed by the surroundings I don't want the movie to end.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a great app. All it needs is ability to link to an internet site for radio programming. Better yet, configure it to play purchased music selections.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|eh- this was a non-finisher. There were parts that were funny but I guess I'm just not that into TV, SND (Saturday Night Dead), or Tina Fey to really be converted into a fan. I tried. I wanted to be. Just didn't make it for me.
B00008MZ0O|5.0|I love muscle cars. When I first watched this movie I said: this is the best car racing movie ever. And so I had to get it. I have seen all five Fast and Furious and this one is by far the best. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are at their best. The stunts are just awesome. &#34;Please don't try this at home&#34;. One of Vin Diesel's greatest movies. Hold on to your seat belts 'cause is going to get fast.
0345803485|1.0|This was the worst book I think I've ever read and I just could not get into these totally unbelievable characters, story, everything.
B00BYOEZTI|4.0|This was a long but fun movie.  The cinematography is awesome, and the story is great.  Can't wait for the next installment!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It was a fantastic experience watching this film. I would recommend it highly to all viewers over 10 years of age. It could be frightening for younger viewers.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love it! Hooked after watching just the first episode.  Watched 3 more the same day.  thankfully there are many more to watch ahead!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|But fun. This will challenge your motor skills. Kids love it too. This is the hardest one in the series.
0307943194|5.0|Always a good book to read. This one was a little different than his other stories but as always, Grisham writes well and has a good ending.
0307719774|2.0|it;s a fun journal to write on, but the quality of the paper is kinda lame.<br />I dont really like all the questions each day either. so...i guess this is just not for me.
B00AJLHULW|5.0|Great sounding CD Always enjoy Robben Ford. This CD has some my favorite RF songs. I'll buy some more RF later.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was really fun and made a person use their brain in order to complete, because you cannot just use the hint key to make it through all levels. There is some levels that mad you really have to think and I like that. Great Game!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. My 9 year old has it on her Kindle Fire and it is a great resource for her and I to have on hand. She will turn to it of her own accord, which is encouraging. Nice way to keep the Word of God current!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent, used this app to help my mother figure her taxes.  Large enough for her to see and accurate.  Great app highly recommended.
0316010669|5.0|Very good book.  I have yet to start on the book but I know by reviews that it will be worth the price.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I love watching music videos old and new ones from the app. The quality is very good and the speed is amazing.
0062502182|5.0|Very good book.  I have yet to start on the book but I know by reviews that it will be worth the price.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|What I love most about this book is that it brings you back to what is important in life.  If we just pay attention to the small things in life....everything seems to fall into place.  Truly a book of wisdom.
0316017930|5.0|Very good book.  I have yet to start on the book but I know by reviews that it will be worth the price.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great game of Mahjong...I love to play and the tiles and backgrounds are colorful! I highly recommend!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie reminds me of all the great times spent in the Arcade with my friends during my youth in the 80's.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Flipboard is a very good alternative to Google Reader as it provides a really great way to group all the important feeds you want to follow. It has certainly made the process of staying up-to-date and increasing knowledge much much easier.
B004IYWN7C|5.0|My brothers and I grew up loving this movie, we knew all of the dance moves of powerline and the songs and lines of the movie. We watched this movie with our children and to our surprise, they enjoyed it as much as we did. We were told to please be quiet so many times because we song every song and even attempted to act out the movie as it played. This is a great family movie with pizza and popcorn. New generation keeper
0062238868|5.0|I was saddend by the loss of Kyle by such tragic means. To his family, you are in my prayers!<br />His biography speaks volumes to the passion one has for country and for one's brothers and sisters in arms. He is so very correct that to fight as he did was for the support of his nation but more so for the protection of his brothers. Ultimately it is not about politics it is about keeping the wolves at bay. He saved lives by excising cancer!
1416974636|5.0|My 10 month old is OBSESSED with this book.  I've actually bought all of Karen Katz' other lift-the-flap books because she liked this one so much, but this remains her favorite.  Highly recommended!
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was entertaining and delivered well.  I would suggest to others for a night of entertainment.
B000GWE44U|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Even with Jack Nicholson saying &#34;Here's Johnny&#34;,  this movie was really thrilling.  The little boy with the Shining Gift [or curse]  was a scene stealer.  As one who knows about Shining,  it can be very frightening,  especially for a child.  This movies was not just about terrifying scenes,  like with the two twin girls,  slaughtered by their own Daddy Dearest,  but the mental downhill roll of Nicholson's character was done just right.  To think,  even it is just a movie,  to be alone in a quite deserted Hotel with a history murder,  sexual disfunctions,  and to have a mad man running around with a hatchet,  after a poor defenseless woman and a little boy who can see the horror on it's way has got to be terrifying.  The haunting music,  from many years gone by, certainly helped too.  This was a Classic that has to be seen on a raining or snowing day.  And if you find a typed pile of papers, with the same sentence over and over, beware of the crazed man running after you in the snow maze.  I hope you all enjoy this..
B00B10GYZ8|4.0|I throughly enjoyed this movie of Hitchcock making Psycho.  It was entertaining and kept my attention throughout the movie.  I would watch again.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I am hooked!This show is very engaging. The acting is first rate, and there's enough humor and wit to leaven the seriousness of the crimes being investigated. Too many loose ends, though, and too long to wait for the next season.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|Read the book as a child and enjoyed the movie as an adult. It was great entertainment that I would watch again.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This is so much better than the first one. Absolutley AWESOME FUN AND ADDICTIVE. One of the best games on the kindle fire
B00028HBKM|5.0|you will love this movie its so real like and will move you. you will sit and cry all the way to the end. you will see how<br />much of pain that christ went though. be careful about small children watching this movie. it has alot of  bad parts in it<br />it show how christ was beat and his body with blood all over him. and when they nail him to the cross. these parts are so bad. not for children to watch. this movie will make you stop and think how much pain he went though for us. it changed my life.
B001R10BM8|5.0|This movie was purchased because it is not included in the boxset. The price could have been a little cheaper.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|What is the purpose of this....haven't figured it out yet....waiting...for now not a fan......that's it for now no ideas boo
0517543052|5.0|I have read the book several times. Each time I learn more about myself and proceed farther down the Path.
B0095P29EG|5.0|This was the first movie I watched on my kindle. Color was clear and bright :-) Wasn't sure I needed a kindle but am enjoying it !
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game is slow, any crashes a lot.  it does not work well with the kindle fire.  it is so fun but crashes too much. I hope imamgi updates it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love a story with unexpected twists and turns. I couldn't find a good place to stop, so read it in one day!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a page turner.  It's a well written account of a difficult happening that involved bullying and resulted in the death of a young person.  Most interesting was how the family of the accused, especially the father, handled it all.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book kept me intrigued from the very beginning. Don't pass it up even if you've seen the movie. You won't be disappointed.
1400025559|5.0|The movie is one of my all time favorites but the book brought the movies to life in a way I could have never imagined!
B005LAIIHG|3.0|I expected something a bit different. It was claimed to be the next Avatar but instead it was more like Cast Away, (Which I didn't like. )
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I always enjoy his beautiful voice and this CD is mostly in English so it's easy to sing along with.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I've read the book and saw all of The Lord of The Ring movies and bought those as well. Great snowstorm movies!!!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Beautiful production values, fabulous case with wonderful voices, and an ethereal score!  How could anyone who enjoyed the Phantom not love this hauntingly beautiful DVD.  I bet I've watched it a dozen times already.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game really is awesome. Great graphics. Good controls. But everytime I tried to play it, it messed up my kindle. My kindle would lock up and go black for 10 minutes. Ahh!!! I had to uninstall it for my kindle to work properly. Which I was upset about because I thought I finally found a good kart/buggy game.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought the 2 seasons of DA and loved them both. I also bought season three.  the Special Features are also a bonuse.  Nothing like it being produced and truly the best thing on TV.
B000SZH8LQ|5.0|I love the sound quality. I am very satisfied with my purchase and recommend Corrine Bailey Rae to everyone. She's a great artist.
B006Y5H74W|4.0|Like Glee for adults.. I LOVE Smash.. great actors, well-written, awesome performances, and musical numbers.  So glad I found Smash =)
1455523550|4.0|I watched the movie \\"Safe Haven\\" and I thought it was fairly good, so when the opportunity came to read the book I took it. The book ended up being much better than the movie. It contains a lot more detail about abuse, Katie's feelings, and overall what was running through everyone's minds. From reading the book, you really feel like you know each character in the story. The movie didn't do it justice because you can't hear the thoughts of the actors. The story lines of the book and movie did end up being a bit different though. There was obviously a lot more detail in the book. It did fantastic in getting into the mind of someone that abuses his or her spouse. It was a fun read, but also disturbing at times. You learn a lot more than you would expect. The book makes you want to take action and help those that are being physically abused. Overall, it is a beneficial book to read. I would recommend it to anyone. Girls would probably like it more than guys, considering it is a love story, but the meaning behind it is good for anyone. So read it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Rarely does a TV show come along that has the power that this one has. Much more than just a story about zombies, there is real drama and plot twists that always keep you guessing. No character (except maybe the leader Rick) is safe so you never know what is going to happen next. I actually am unnerved when I watch this show, and their cliff hanger endings always leave me wanting to know what happens next! The governor was a great addition to the current plot. He is as scary of a character as you can imagine. On the surface kind and gentle, and underneath a complete monster who will tell you all the lies you want to hear. I hope the writers keep up the excellent work, and I look forward to many more seasons of this fantastic series!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded the game on my kindle to entertain my friend's 11 year old son who happens to be autistic. He chose the game and apparently already knew how to play and was having a ball!! The next day I had totally forgotten that we had downloaded the game and I was curious so I tried it out. I then found myself totally consumed for the next 2hrs straight!! The game is challenging and fun for all ages!! I would recommend it to anyone:)
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The first time I saw this show was in Shanghai China, it was playing on the only English speaking TV station I could find, and I thought it was OK. Later I decided to buy a season and try it out - I'm always hungry for good comedies and they are few and far between. It turns out now to be one of my favorites shows. It takes a while to understand the dynamics of the characters, but once you do you become hooked.
0606238433|2.0|The cover is great but the book is small and the paper is a little gray, letters are small too, not recommend. I will buy the paperback edition
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|Although the effects, acting, and sets are very good in this movie, it suffers from one major problem - the book should have been made into one movie, not three. There just simply isn't enough material in the original book to stretch this out to a 8 or 9 hour saga.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|This is not their usual type of album but if you listen to it many times you begin to love it. I especially love the first song on it called Because We Can. Hope they go back to their old style but I still love this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This one started a bit slower than I'm used to, but I loved it and could read it again and again, just as I have Sparks' other novels.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|Great movie. I love Mark Wahlberg and he doesn't dissapoint in this movie. Alot of action as usual. Would highly recommend.

B00B1E6FF8|4.0|This is one of a few movies that had us thinking about it days and days after seeing it.  We were mesmerized by the screenplay and directing.  The acting was mostly very good.  Besides the lead, Jessica Chastain, the performances turned in by Jason Clarke and Reda Kateb were fantastic.<br /><br />Obviously there were points of the story that were condensed for the movie and there is no doubt some dramatic and artistic licenses were taken but that is no different than any other movie that explores real world events.  But the sheer brutality of the story, from all angles, is undeniable.  And the art direction was greatly under appreciated by pretty much everyone.  The sets and locales truly made you feel like you were in the real locations portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is for the lackluster extra features.  A couple of behind-the-scenes pieces are all fine and dandy but I was sorely disappointed at the complete lack of any commentary by the cast and crew.  This movie, above most others, truly deserved that extra \\"voice\\" of how they went about telling the story of the world's most notorious manhunt.<br /><br />A finely crafted and acted movie.  Much more deserving to be seen than some of its critics suggest in my humble opinion.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Fun movie. We watched it three times during our rental time agreement. :) We would recommed it for family viewing.
0767836324|5.0|This movie is great. I saw it for the first time when I was a teenager and now my daughter is seeing it. She loved it as much as I did.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The movies are great and trilogy package is great as a gift for someone.  Good deal too for the money.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|We downloaded this on the kindle fired. The game is fun to play and the graphics are awesome. It is difficult enough to make it entertaining but not frustrating. One kid (13 y.o boy) gave it a 3.5 and the other (15 y.o. girl) gave it a 5 so we split the difference.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|it is so hilarious I just love seeing the people scream in terror YAY :) I totally approve this oh and also I am not a worker for the company (no lie)
B0000VCZKM|3.0|The movie arrived promptly but when played, parts of the dialogue could not be heard at all which made the movie less enjoyable for everyone watching...but especially the children.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|My 12 year old daughter is into the book series and loved this movie.  She watched it twice and really liked the role of #6.  It is also a good fun action movie for adults which makes it a good teenage family movie.
B00BU2SIW4|2.0|The Newest Addendum to My Review (read: After the 7 day test)-<br /><br />I got a lot of guff from some of you for not liking this album on first listen. So, I vowed to give it the 7 day test (listen to the whole album once or twice a day for a week)...to those of you who are still telling yourselves that this is a great album, you are deluded. I hold to my original statement that 'this album is like they took every great idea that they ever had and mashed it together in a very poor fashion'. Several times throughout this album I hear older DM songs, which is a disappointment...listen closely and you'll agree that many of these are re-issues of better, earlier work, just revamped and with a lyric change. Anyone catch the redone 'Corrupt'? Seriously, the creativity is lacking greatly here. I had also stated somewhere in the reply posts that this album seemed done more from DM 'formula' rather than being a solid honest collection of new material. As for the 'bonus material' on disc 2...hardly a bonus in my opinion. The bonus would have been if they didn't include that 2nd disc. Sorry again, guys...you just made a crap album this time (or would it be 2 crap albums?...or maybe a crap album, and a crap EP?...whatever...This time around, it's crap).<br /><br />I add now: I believe I have identified the problem with this album, and the core of it's failing points...The guys have been too busy collaborating with everyone else, and working on their own stuff, that those influences have bled into Depeche Mode as a band. They failed to keep outside work 'outside', and are a different band on this album. This isn't Depeche Mode...this is Dave, and Martin, and Fletch, and all of their side projects labeled as a Depeche Mode album. I stay with the original statement I made about there only being a few pearls in this collection, while the remainder of the album is utter rubbish. Nice try, guys...but go back to being Depeche Mode, and put away all of the side work that is threatening to ruin your band's good name, and in my opinion, the names of the greatest of the electronic musicians ever. They could have done better...they really could have. But again, and to be completely fair, it took them over 30 years to produce a stinker...and that's a pretty good track record for a band that's been around as long as they have.<br /><br />In review: Listen before you buy! There just isn't enough good material in this collection to pay full price for the whole album. I still love Depeche Mode...just not THIS album.<br /><br />My First Impression Review from release day -<br /><br />To the Band: GUYS! What happened here?! Was Martin drunk through this whole thing? Were all of you drunk? This album is rubbish! And Martin: To have compared yourself to the Beatles on the final track was a blatantly self serving remark to be sure. The Beatles you aint! Unfortunately I don't know anything about the writing here...was this all Martin's stuff again? Is he finally giving Dave some input in a real way on songs? I mean...I'm at a loss here. It just stinks guys...you're people are lying to you if they told you it was great, or your best stuff yet. It's not. To much of 'someone's' personal drama in here for sure...Martin's is my guess. Again...still don't know the details on the writing yet. You could have done better I believe. But look at it this way...it was over 30 years before you put out a stinker, so that's on your side at least.<br /><br />To the Fans and potential purchasers of this album: I have to say, I have been a loyal fan and follower since the early 80's when they first hit the scene. In a sentence: This collection is just not indicative of the Depeche Mode experience at all. Other than a pearl here and there, almost every track is a sad parody of their earlier work, to be most polite in my criticism.<br /><br />If I was being harsh, then my review would be: This album sucks! I cannot believe that this is MY Depeche Mode, who I have loved for so very long...sadness strikes my heart to think that they have finally gone over in the way of Aerosmith, The Stones, etc. (read: Great Acts that didn't know when to hang it up) This collection is reaching for the kiss of life, and getting turned down cold. If this is what has become of Depeche Mode, I cannot say that I will be going to the tour this time around. Absolute rubbish!! Save your money...Buy a GOOD Depeche Mode album instead...everything prior to this collection is an excellent choice, but avoid this one. Better yet, listen to your friend's copy first so you don't have to pay for it without actually hearing it all, because you are going to feel like you got robbed when you're done listening to this disc if you pay for the whole thing. Best bet here is to preview it somewhere else, then come back and buy the few good tracks on it. I'll leave the decision of what on here is 'good' to you, as everyone's tastes differ. But as a long time follower and fan, you owe it to yourself to heed my advice before purchasing this one in full. I never thought I would be dissatisfied with a Depeche Mode album, BUT there is always a first time for everything, as they say.<br /><br />If you are actually a new fan from this album, then you owe it to yourself to hear them at their finest in their earlier work! They matured well in the early 90's with \\"Violator\\" so start there, and keep going towards the current stuff to have the best Depeche Mode ever. My personal favorites are \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\", \\"Playing the Angel\\", and 'Sounds of the Universe\\". 'Ultra' and 'Exciter' are both very solid albums as well, I just prefer the other three I mentioned. Sadly I think 'Sounds of the Universe' was their last really great album though, having heard this one out. For a more retro Depeche Mode, you can check out: Some Great Reward, Black Celebration, and Music for the Masses. Going back further than those however, will expose you to early 80's electro pop, not at all what they havecome to be known for as the 'Gloom Pop Gods' of the music world. There is another good offering in 'People are People' which was actually an amalgamation of stuff from earlier albums and 'Some Great Reward', but it does have some of that electro pop I mentioned.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was enthralling. I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next one!!!! I am more than willing to buy games like this. It is so worth it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great game easy to play and win. try it you'll. like it.<br />play while you watch TV. better. than regular solitaire.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This is an awesome approach to eating, not only for losing weight, but for a lifetime of good health.<br /><br />I started this program as soon as I read the book (which took only a couple hours). It's been 3 weeks and I've lost nearly 10 pounds. I find it very easy to stick to this program because I know that after a day's fast, I can eat as I please the next day. I have to admit, on my eating days, I've had ice cream, cake, cookies, pizza...and have lost weight anyway. The fast days are hungrier, but I look forward to them as my mind seems sharper, my energy greater, and my overall mood is more cheerful and upbeat. Everything promised in the book is delivered by this diet. I hate to even call it a diet since I have so many bad associations with dieting (mainly constant failure). But the FastDiet is different; it makes you feel better, and you never feel deprived. The interesting thing is that after every fast day, I feel more motivated, instead of less as with other diets. A friend is doing Weight Watchers while I do this, and I've lost more weight in less time with less hassle and less desire to quit. Not having to count points, measure or weigh foods, worry about an extra teaspoon or tablespoon of this or that, is quite frankly a joy. My brother and his wife lost weight on a program that I tried and was unable to maintain - first of all, because there was never a day to eat as I pleased, and second, because the details were impossible to endure. That diet recommends so much fibrous material that I, who have suffered with irritable bowels most of my life was sitting on the toilet at least four times daily, with my intestines twisting themselves into knots.<br /><br />This program is the best I've ever tried, and I recommend it to anyone who has had trouble with other diets. The FastDiet is an easy recipe for weight loss success and clearly does everything advertised.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|This show is so fun for adults and kids alike. The opening scene when all the birds are dancing in the jungle is spectacular!! We love this movie!  It has a feel good storyline.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I sleep better because of this show.  The acting is great throughout, restrained when needed and over-the-top scenery-chewing when called-for.  Enough said.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love having it @ my fingertips instead of searching around for a paper and pen all the time. Great app! Thanks
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a great match 3 game. Graphics look amazing on my tablet =) lots of lots of levels to play
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I need these for my scale and I got these quickly and they worked fine like they were supposed to
B009RX85N0|2.0|I had high hopes for this series, and while a good bit of it is still pretty good, the  actress portraying Snow White is the one of the worst cases of bad casting since Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. She is not at all attractive (certainly not the fairest of them all), has a horrendous haircut, and folks, she can't act! The actor portraying Prince Charming isn't much better. They have no chemistry because they are both boring, bad actors. If the writers would just kill off these two characters, the series would be much, much better. The soap opera element is just too sweet.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|This book is fun and romantic, as Cassia runs across treacherous plains and canyons looking for her true love. This book was a great sequel to Matched and I can't wait to read the next one. I thought that compared to the last, but that is understandable. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read Matched and are looking for a survival romance.
B009KEN87O|5.0|What can I say. If you like shooting aliens this game if for you. It will keep you entertained. You won't be disappointed.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Sucks big time.  You have to keep buying levels.  Not even worth a star and not worth the time.  Horrible
B000002GYN|5.0|The eagles debut album, there is a reason this album has sold so many copies. It is pure greatness. So perfect. How do the Eagles make it sound so easy?.
B001XULSG6|5.0|Of all the Star Trek movies this is probably the best one in my view. Plenty of action and drama even if watched more than once. Humor is also present. Humanity is explored. Only one glitch I think, since the queen Borg is killed in the past then a paradox for the Borg is created it would seem. Always a problem for time travel movies. Frakes did a very good directing job.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I've gotten sucked into books about the south. Love reading about the culture. The characters kept me coming back! It had been years since I'd seen the movie and watched it again. It was disappointing how much they changed from the book.

B003L77FYS|5.0|Love the entertaining stories and great chemistry of the cast.  Highly recommend the show.  Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|the game has very clear graphics the only game play is vera y much like the call or duty games the best way to get good graphics is to be connected to wiring or mobile hotspot
B000VR824S|1.0|This is my second favorite DVD to Crossroads 2010. All of the finest blues musicians with memorable performances. Great videography and sound. The discs I purchased through the Amazon site however are not playable in the US. Very disappointed that they were shipped in a format not playable in the US. Haven't asked for my money back yet, but I will.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|this series just gets better and better. I am so hooked on this, can't wait for the whole next season.
B00428CPUY|5.0|Best performances ever by a happy bunch of great guitarists. Excellent videography and sound. Unbelievable collection of artists. Nice blend of mostly blues with tinges of country and rock. Only exceptional musicians - can't wait for this year's effort.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my absolute favorite game I have ever played. I know everyone will love this app and I know they will want to get it.
B009NX3U20|3.0|Spoiler; The movie was interesting; however I wish it would have had a better resolution. Instead it had the same action/horror ending of leaving most dead with one person surviving for some terrible sequel<br /><br />Pros: did not feature an overuse of CGI.<br />Cons: somewhat predictable
B00B0NDF26|4.0|My son loves this group and I purchased it out of curiosity.  Was surprised how good this group is.  Very nice vocals and good lyrics.
1455508977|5.0|Both my daughter and granddaughter like to read.  They both really liked the book.  I do not have anymore to say.
B008JOLG7U|4.0|Great selection of her dance songs.  Nice to have a compilation of songs to listen to while in the gym or to wake your body up in the morning.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|So far so good with this game. You really have to think about what to do next. It seems confusing at first but hopefully it gets better.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This is such a beautifully written novel that I was able to accept the story despite its outlandishness. The animals, especially Richard Parker, are described with such loving attention that they are real characters. There's a strong religious element, which didn't interest me, but the underlying proposition, which is revealed at the end, left me thinking about just how scientific and rational I am. This book will stay with me for a long time.
B007SGM084|5.0|To read all three books, it took me 4 days!  I cannot wait for more books from E L James!  I'd love for her to write books from Christian's point of view.... maybe about the previous 15 subs.......
B003E20ZQA|2.0|Sorry but found this dragged on. Sad world, everything for art. Was disappointed as I had read a good review.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like this book because it has everything you need to know about words and I would like to recommend it
B00BESLHEA|2.0|This seems to be a long movie made short.  The movie jumps from scene to scene and the headline actors play support roles.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I Enjoyed it with all the family ,we  cant wait until the next one. Its long but it goes fast.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A very creative story with clever special affects.  I label it a must see film and recommend it to anyone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of those movies/shows that one would love to own, it's classic therefore it's timeless. I can imagine my great great great grand children to also love this movie. I definitely recommend it to my friends
B0081336FO|5.0|You'd think people would be tired of the Sherlock Holmes concept, but this show is loads of fun.  What makes this show so great is the relationship between Watson and Holmes.  Watson sometimes is the main character, and seen through his eyes, Sherlock is a struggling misanthrope trying to hold on to what little humanity he has.  The Moriarty sub plots have already jumped the shark a bit, but still, lots of interesting and modernized twists on old favorites like the Hound of the Baskerville.  My only regret is the show was only part of two short seasons.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|There's so much to love about this film I hardly know where to start. First, it's based on the Frank Miller graphic novel by the same name, and having read said GN, I can confirm that the film follows the GN very closely! This is definitely a fan film, made by Batman fans FOR Batman fans.
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|Mike gives a clear insight on what is needed to achieve that professional sound in the homestudio. his approach is cost effective and proven in the articles he  writes for SOS magazine.  Highly recommended.
1401235425|5.0|This is an excellent reboot of the Batman prime comic book which ended in September 11 with issue # 713--a VERY LONG run for any comic, although Detective was well into the 800s. The story here starts off in a serious way without any fluff or delay, jumping right into the &#34;launch story&#34;, which I will not give away because there are plenty of other spoilers in other less considerate reviews. As someone who read the original comic issues first, this is for a repeat reading enjoyment and not my first viewing of the issues.<br /><br />I think some people are a bit confused over the Court of Owls which might be hinted at but does not yet begin in this book. If you want the Court of Owls story arc, pick up the 2nd volume which has issues 7-12 (and really Owls only takes up 8-11). This book is PRE-OWLS, in other words, just leading up to the beginning of that story arc.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Written humorously and with wit.  Mr. Sloan cleverly portrays the new world of computers and their magic in an ancient mystery story.
1401233384|5.0|I totally enjoyed the artwork and story! Awesome! This story was reportedly the event that led up to the New 52, but I haven't been about to find any such connection despite the insistence of fans. I'm not a very big Flash fan but really do recommend this book for any DC fan because it's also a good Justice League story with all the characters. What is especially shocking is how badly behaved both Diana and Aquaman are in this story. Are they really capable of murdering 100 million people? I find that hard to believe, frankly, and it shook my faith a bit about the validity of the story. It's compelling writing but I'm not sure it fits the characters. Even if Themiscera had been destroyed by Atlantis, is that reason to wipe out an entire continent of humans? That is how she is portrayed, as taking part in that destruction. But if you pay close attention to the story, she really wasn't responsible for wiping out Europe--the water attack was all Aquaman's doing. However, she did annihilate Britain and take it over. Which also does not fit her character. True, it's an alternate timeline, but the story did not reveal that these alternates had dramatically different personalities, they were responding to events which had escalated.
B005DD7TI0|5.0|wow. good film. Good action, very entertaining. Struggling book writer stumbles upon a pill that lets him use all of his brain power. Changes his life.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is Vietnam movie directed by Stanley Kubrick. It is set in 1967 in the Vietnam War and the main casts for the movie are Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, R. Lee Ermey. There are two main parts for this movie. First it starts off with the training camp for future soldiers in the Vietnam War. Ths second part is the war following the Tet Offensive from the North Vietnamese. This story explores the mentality of each soldier and it shows how war changes a person. War is cruel, and this is a sad story of where the soldiers lose their friends and each person is changed after these experiences. The platoon of US soldiers included soldiers nicknamed, Joker, Cowboy, and Gormer Pyle. The training camp started with the Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. He is strict in discipline and he tried to train his troops for the Vietnam War. However, even if Hartman's discipline, not all the soldiers obeyed his orders and not everything worked out. Hartman later even discovered a jelly doughnut with Pyle, which started to intensify Pyle's training. Each time Pyle makes a mistake, the whole platoon would have to suffer for his mistakes while Pyle takes no blame. Pyle in return was being restrained and beaten by the other troopers. This caused Pyle to change. He changed into a disciplined soldier, but he was mentally different. Joker, a friend of Pyle was worried about his situation. Pyle was talking to his own gun and he wasn't in a stable state. During graduation night, Pyle was loading his gun in the bathroom while reciting the Rifleman's Creed and Joker tried to stop him. Hartman came in and told him to surrender his gun, however in the end, Pyle killed Hartman and suicides.    The story later takes place in 1968, when Joker becomes a Sergeant. The Tet Offense attacks were occurring and the North Vietnamese were attempting to take over the base. Joker was sent to Phu Bai, accompanied by Raftman, a combat photographer. Joker accompanies a squad with Cowboy in the Battle of Hue. But unfortunate events happen, the squad gets killed by booby traps, snipers and because of uncontrollable emotions, some of the squad members charged in and attempted to avenge his teammates. But in the end, the sniper killed more soldiers like Animal Mother, Doc Jay and Cowboy. However Joker discovers the sniper later, which was a girl. He went to take the shot, however his gun jams. Luckily, Rafterman comes and shoots her, although the shots do not kill her. Then Joker had the chance to kill her and when he did, the marines congratulate him on the kill. In the end The Marines march toward their camp, singing the Mickey Mouse March. Joker said that he was `in a world of s***' but he was happy to be still alive and he isn't afraid of the war anymore.    The movie conveys some really deep messages in the plot and it was generally a dark film. There were moments and scenes where it is almost pitch black and this movie shows the violence of a true war zone. In the training camp, we can see how the Vietnam War can change someone's perspective. Pyle was a lazy soldier and he wasn't disciplined at all. The brutality of his team changed him and he was something different. The training camp caused Pyle to have a mental breakdown, which made him constantly recite the Rifleman's Creed, which was something that soldiers recited for their practices. It was dark and mellow and in the end, he couldn't take the pressure and he suicides and killed Hartman. War is brutal and America tries to constantly draft more people into the war and many of the citizens refused to join.    The war scenes in the movie also created a sad and destructive mood. There was gunfire everywhere and the buildings and villages were wrecked. The terrors of the Vietnam War are shown in this film and it conveys the feelings of each American soldier. A lot of the soldiers were afraid and they didn't want to be in the war. The Vietcong had a territorial advantage, which led to the downfall of the battle forthe Americans. During the battles, we can also see the emotions that come out of each soldier. When Dr Jay and Eightball were sniped in the battlefield, Animal Mother couldn't bare to see them just die like that on the field. He had to go out and save them regardless of what he can do. This situation was similar to stories in \\"Things They Carried\\" by Tim O'Brien, which talked about Norman Bowlker who didn't want to leave the war zone because he felt like he needed to be there to save his other teammates. Animal Mother rushed out to try and hunt for the sniper. Without any mental thinking and judgment, he lost his senses, like any American soldier would do and charged in. This resulted in his death and this shows how war changes and affects a person personally.     At the end of the movie, Joker found the sniper and it was actually a female. From this movie, we could see the Vietcong could vary in any type of person. They may look innocent but they still have a violent heart to kill the Americans. The last part of the movie symbolizes a lot. The soldiers were marching away to their camp while singing the Micky Mouse March. This was ironic because it was a happy song but the surroundings were filled with fire and many soldiers died after the battle. However each person was happy to clear out for the day and they marched on to another day through that song. It boosted their morale and they continued on. The last lines Joker reflected on also meant a lot as he says he is stuck `in a world of s***' describing the situation in Vietnam. It's disgusting, dirty and dangerous but in the end, after these situations, he is finally not afraid. This movie overall was a great movie, it gave depth to how intense and what soldiers require to be in this war. It shows the true inside of a person's mind and the Vietnam War was a huge influence.
B001FVV2X2|2.0|I loved the X-files, I loved Lost, until that dreadful last season.  I love sci-fi and don't need my entertainment grounded in reality and scientific accuracy.  Fringe however uses the most ridiculous pseudoscience passed off as science to...I am not sure why they are doing it actually.  They toss just enough mangled real science in with new age schlock to totally get in the way of what might have been an alright story.<br /><br />I am perfectly willing to let go of reality and enjoy a good story but when they ask me to abandon all critical thinking skills and even the &#34;skeptic&#34; is willing to take this garbage at face value, I have to give up and turn it off.  It is a shame, I have been looking for something along the lines of Lost and X-Files for a long time.
B006QF61VA|5.0|Jason Lui<br />Mr. Evans- AMS SFE<br />Vietnam War Docudrama 1<br />Good Morning Vietnam<br /><br />\\"Good Morning Vietnam!\\" was the main motto and the movie title of movie about the Vietnam War. This was a war comedy movie directed by Barry Levinson and the title in the movie talks mostly about the morale of the American troops, the censorship of media and the local life of Vietnam. The story was set in 1965, and it talked about an Airman First Class Adrian Cronauer (played by Robin William) who arrives in Saigon from Crete to work as a DJ for Armed Forces Radio Service. He first enters the place with curiosity and the place is nothing like America. The beer in local Vietnam is terrible, the streets are different, and the weather was terrible. However Adrian came here to boost the morale of the troops, however the Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson didn't like the way Adrian was broadcasting the information. Adrian's way of broadcasting and his comedy were spectacular and the soldiers really enjoyed it. He had fan letters from everyone and he played loud and active music that boosted the army's morale.<br /><br />Through out the movie, Adrian also went out to the local life of Vietnam and met some new people. He went to a local English school in Vietnam, went to local bars and he also experienced the local markets and life styles of the Vietnamese. He made friends with the Vietnamese and he interacted with them a lot. One of his closest friends was Tuan, which taught him many of the traditions and introduced Adrian to his sister Trinh. Adrian was interacting with the locals and he started to enjoy the daily life there. His radio broadcasting was also successful, however the sergeant and lieutenant were both constantly telling him to change his content because it wasn't suited for the soldiers. Also, Adrian was also unhappy about the censorship the military is providing. He believes they have the right to know everything, but the military leaders don't allow it. Adrian later was suspended once, but later he was called back. However in the end, Adrian found out about Tuan being a terrorist, who is wanted by the South Vietnamese police, this resulted in losing his job and losing a close friend. He left the final voice message to all the soldiers and enjoyed the company of the Vietnamese on the last day and left Vietnam after five months of working.<br /><br />This movie really portrayed the life in Vietnam. It wasn't about the war zones, but it was about integrating an American into the Vietnam life. In one part of the movie, it showed how Americans were racist to the Vietnamese that went into the bar. The American soldier started to insult Tuan and had a bar fight with Adrian in the end. In Vietnam life, Adrian also spent time in a Vietnamese cinema, it had English subtitles and this shows how common an American life is. The streets that we see from the movie, there are Americans everywhere. They are smoking, drinking, it's like a common thing and American life is simulated in it. In the movie, one of the main scenes was in an English school. A military soldier was teaching the Vietnamese simple English, just like a first grade class in a normal American school. American influence is strong in the country, and these actions were a sign to pacification. America tries to educate the Vietnamese, let to simulate into their society and show that America is trying to help and save this country. The class has a range from high school students to old people; this shows that America is educating every single person in the country. The people are learning and a lot of them have fun learning this new language. When Adrian came in the class, he taught about simple slang language, or daily American things like baseball to these people. It was a mixed society and there are different perspectives for everyone.<br /><br />In the story, there are Vietnamese that blame America for the damages that were done in thecountry. There were terrorist bombings that destroyed the bar where the Americans go. There were protests on the streets and the police had to use violence to stop these actions. The Vietnamese police even had to secretly kill all the traitors as they caused a threat to the society they were in. Tuan in the end was part of these traitors. He explained to Adrian in the end, \\"Enemy? What is an enemy? You killing my own people so many miles from your home. We're not the enemy. You're the enemy. Big deal! My mother's dead. And my older brother, he's dead. Shot by Americans. My neighbor, dead. His wife, dead. Why? Because we're not human to them. We're only little Vietnamese.\\" This was very strong and we could see the hatred among some of the Vietnamese in the south. There is hatred towards America and to them, America isn't doing them a favor.<br /><br />The last thing the movie strongly portrayed was the influence of media and the morale the soldiers needed. During the Vietnam War, many of the soldiers missed their family, loss their friends and suffered in many other hardships. Adrian was the DJ that was sent here to boost the morale of these troops. When Adrian met the soldiers on the field personally, he knew how influential he was. His jokes provided happiness and provided another purpose towards life and war. It helped to fight better and reminded them of their American spirit. However, in the movie we can see how the army tries to hide the true news from the soldiers out in the field. There was news like, \\"US military leaders in Saigon urge secretary of Defense, Mcnamara to approve a force level of 350,000 to 400,000 US soldiers.\\" These things were censored and a lot of things were not correctly reported. Like the bar explosion was also not mentioned in the broadcast because the generals don't want the soldiers to know about the tragic news that was brought upon them. However, this angered Adrian and he didn't get to truly give out the meaning of the broadcast. However in the end, he ended in good note, he got to know the people and had a relationship with Vietnam. Overall, this was a good comedy movie that gave an insight into Vietnam and it showed things other than war zones in Vietnam.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I could not put the book down... eventhough it was sad at times. Reichs writes great mysteries and I love that she adds medical and anthro terminology.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so fun that when my mom told me to take the dog out I just stayed there and that is not normal because I love my dog.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Very good and easy to use the writing is good.I enjoyed reading this book I recommend everyone to reading it
B006PAZMMK|5.0|best .99 i ever spent, music is good if your into that kind of sound but again got to say best .99 i spent
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved the movie and can't wait for the next two! If you have read the books naysayers will realize there is a difference between the two stories. The hobbit is always the lighter of the series.
0142421715|3.0|First off, it is hard to impress me when it comes to sequels. This book was at the lower end of the totem poll. I do like these characters and I want to know how it all ends, but there where parts that I was wishing would pick up. It just seemed like things where being repeated so many times! I know Ky and Cassie love each other and will do anything to find one another, but it doesn't need to be stated all the time. Plus Xander isn't in there that much. I do say it is worth reading, especially if you want to know how the trilogy ends!
B004XANKVO|5.0|Provide 25-year warranty. Is made of very high quality. I highly recommend it. Thule did eliminate, the problem of selection of bags for 17&#34; macbook pro users.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I saw the denouement coming with lots of improbable stuff in between.  Didn't buy the cutting of whole words by the protagonist.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|If you enjoy Medieval Fantasy then you will bow down before Game of Thrones. It comes at a cost though... the cost of everything dear to you in your LIFE...
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Who doesn't like Angry Birds?  You get exactly what you expect - the crazy birds flying across the screen smashing the pigs.
B0091W5UWG|5.0|loved it very good movie will watch it again & again if you have not watched it you need to
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is a lot of fun.  My daughter enjoys being able to slash the fruit randomly across the screen by simply moving her fingertip.
B008UWEFU6|4.0|Got it for the Wife she loved it and already is done with the books. over all good price got here on time and was what i ordered.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|This movie is one I was so excited to get and will watch it again.  Worth every dime and minute of the wait.  Very well done and gives you an inside to the actions we did not know was happening and the drive behind one woman that brought this notorious enemy down.  So proud of her and the Navy Seals that pulled this off.  This movie paints the good side of the CIA, which is refreshing.  It matches all the accounts I had heard as well as other Seal's account of the night.  So glad they did not give all the credit to the white house.
B00138H876|5.0|I purchased \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" for 99¢ after using a coupon code. Best 99¢ I've ever spent! This is one of *the* quintessential albums that belongs in the collection of even the most casual Bob Dylan fan...
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I enjoy the combination of cello and piano together! The medlodies are moving.  I especially love the track called A Thousand Years!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Great for journaling or taking notes while in class. No more carrying pencils/pens and lots of notebooks. Keeps the last page of whatever you typed/wrote. Can have multiple 'journals' and as many pages as you like. (I have one that I'd selected to have 1000 pages. We'll see if I actually use them all or not but a great option to have).
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Everyone will benefit from reading this book. It helps you to learn about how you enjoy expressing love and how you want others to express love to you. Given love is not solely an emotion, this book is not just for lovers and couples. This book also applies to frienships and parental child relationships.  The more we learn how to express love to one another the better we can improve our communication and connection in relationships.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Nothing really to dislike about this app. What's great about this app is the ease of use, no real requirement to be online to use. Great app for anyone who doesn't want to destroy their hard copy Bible by lugging it around in their bag or purse.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this one is the most exciting of the trilogy! Catching Fire is certainly my favorite of the three books.
B0029LX2LC|4.0|This album offers quite a mixture of styles in this one with a undertones of jazz, rock, hip-hop, and r&b.
B005SODYGA|5.0|Compilation disk of the best of Rammstein!<br />This is their best without having to buy several disks.<br />You won't regret it.
B000006N7A|3.0|You know, when you order an album like this, you expect the performance to blow your mind with music, or at least make you start tapping your feet uncontrollably. Unfortunately for me, neither happened.
6305212112|5.0|Here we go into the lives of people who could be our next door neighbors as they confront and conquer life's little issues. Kathy Bates and Jessica Lange together make the movie. BUY IT!
B000002KHH|5.0|&#34;I Am Ironman!&#34; -nuff said. But since I need to say more to be able to post this review... there. :)
B00003CXTG|5.0|For youngsters out there who do not really remember anything about WWII and Pearl Harbor, this is choice. Granted, there is some 'poetic license' used, but the DVD is still a good one for any true collector of WWII films.<br /><br />It arrived quickly in exceptional condition.
B001DEXDNI|4.0|When an album has more than two songs that you can listen to on a regular basis, you have a winner. This album is a winner!
B000062X90|5.0|This was one of my favorite CD's back in the early 1970's... My boyfriend made Tolkien statues and paintings, and we often played this album at that time.<br /><br />the CD looks pristine, as brand new.
B000WQW988|3.0|If you compare to the Alice In Chains Unplugged, or even the Stone Temple Pilots Unplugged (I can't find it for sale anywhere though -please contact me if you know where it can be had), this performance left a lot to be desired. And 3 stars is being generous sad to say.
B005F3XV62|5.0|Really nice family time with popcorn type of DVD.<br />Received the DVD quickly and it is in excellent shape.<br /><br />Thanks!
B000002UR7|4.0|I wanted this album for only one song (for those who know Radiohead know which one), but found that the entire album was good. It's a keeper!
B00BN2CY7G|5.0|It took a few plays to get used to it as I was not familiar with the songs, But it was worth the purchase.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I love this band, have always liked them from the beginning and this is another great example of their music. Dave Grohl is the man and his songs are awesome. From Monkey Wrench to Wasting Light it doesnt get any better.
B004U52VPS|2.0|my kids love angry birds.  building the structures can be challenging and getting them to stay up so you can launch birds at the structure before it falls on its own. launcher is a a little difficult for a 6 year old to control and aim accurately.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is a great trilogy and I wish Larsson had lived on and written more books, it's a very good read and I couldn't put it down once I started them.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Love this movie - arrived within 3 days and immediately watched it.  Also, very inexpensive so definitely worth the impulse buy.
0060516402|4.0|This is a great beginning place to start if you're getting more into UX. I'm a front end developer who's getting into UX and this has helped a bunch. Great source of what to do and not to do.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|only purchased because it was on sale. Locked out of Heaven is very catchy, I'll give him that. I'm a big police fan and it definitely has a Police sound to it.  Sure enough he performed with Sting at the grammy's so there ya go. None of the other songs sound like that single so just be aware... but you can tell that just from listening to the previews.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I love Daft Punk and I love this movie. A big reason why it's a pretty good movie is the fact that Daft Punk's music is the soundtrack. I listen to this all the time and I love this album, the re-mix album is very good as well.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|BEEN USING IT FOR QUITE AWHILE! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! WORKS ON ALL VERSION OF ANDROID, EXCEPT HAVEN'T TRIED IT ON TABLET YET. EXPECT I WILL HAVE ISSUES THERE, AS RESOLUTIONS ARE DIFFERENT. OTHERWISE A-1!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Read the Long Walk by Stephen King. It's much much better and a lot deeper too.  I also dislike Peeta.
0375851569|5.0|Classic books. Who doesn't love Dr. Seuss? Gave it as a gift and the parents were thrilled. The toddler &#34;reads&#34; them by himself,too. Good value
B006IYG5HE|4.0|This book by Jo Nesbo is dominated by the presence of Harry Hole, a policeman who is drinking coffee and beer, smoking cigarettes, and watching the 'Robinson Expedition'.  This sets the atmosphere of the book, which is full of jokes, as well as being well-written.  Right from the beginning you know that you are reading something special because of the dialogue, which is sharp and witty (the conversation between Harry and Ellen in the first pages), plus that the story will be something special (the arrival of the President).<br /><br />I will not dwell on the plot, but only say that the book shifts between the end of WWII and the present (around the new millennium). When you have read the end, you want more, and that wish can be fulfilled by reading the next books in the series (the next book is 'Nemesis').<br /><br />I have also read the Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larsson, but don't know if I like those books better;  but if you have read that series, I can only recommend that you read the books by Jo Nesbo -- you will not be disappointed.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this to replace going to Zumba class. This is NOT Zumba. Much harder, much more focused, much sweatier. She has two helpers going through the routines with her. One does a modified version, which is helpful for beginners. It took me almost a week to work up to being able to go through the whole 20 minutes, but she's right that change WILL happen fast. Among the things I appreciate about this workout is that you get occasional glimpses of the helpers cheating or wincing as they go through the moves. YES! Even hot, smiling Amazons with rippling abs get tired!  The only downside is that there's a lot of introduction/ads before you can access the main menu. Now, I just put it in 5 minutes before I want to start and keep the TV off. Otherwise, I highly recommend this.
B009PEKRY6|3.0|Bought this because I like her song &#34;Ready or Not&#34; and then saw that is was only $5. So, I decided to check out the rest of the album.
B00BDZV7WQ|1.0|2013-03-26
B006LSZECO|5.0|I hate, dread, totally avoid books that become hits by reviews fast. And I did so with this book. But after lack of other choices one evening I started it, and I'm glad I did, it has very much earned the 5 stars from me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a book.  Not only was the writing style unique, but every chapter kept you guessing.  If  you are looking for a book that you can't predict the ending and you sit at the edge of your seat with each page flip, this is the book for you.  Highly recommend!
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game, fun and the idea of it seems easy but you gotta watch out for those bombs, I havent been able to get pass the first level yet!! But it is full of fun!!
B002S45V32|5.0|Even though I have this movie already, loved that I could stream it on my kindle fire HD and the quality of it was great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is seriously mom porn. Everyone told me about it being that way and I didnt believe them. OMG I absolutely love this book and so wish I had a Christian Grey of my own!! This is a must read for anyone over the age of 18. It gets pretty expicit!!
B000W746GK|5.0|I bought the movie because we are big Harry Potter fanatics.  We have watched the movie and there seem to be no problems.  Widescreen but that is great for my HD TV as it is widescreen.  Shipped in great time<br /><br />Note: Not much on the extras side so if that is what your looking for, look elsewhere..
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The CGI graphics are fantastic.  More than 80% of the movie was just the young man and the Bengal tiger (cgi graphics) on a boat and in the water.  Acting was 'okay' but the story line with lessons learned and movie quality was well worth while.  I would not, however, have your young children watch.  There are some hard lessons that may be disturbing to a young one.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|Great CD. ARRIVED ON TIME and appear to be new as advertised thanks so much will order again. Well done
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Excellent movie, very suspenseful.  If you leave to get snacks this is one movie that you will have to pause because you do not want to miss a single second of it.  Highly recommend this movie.
B003VANOFY|5.0|this headset is great i love it to death and dont want to part with it i bought it about a year ago and its still alive and kicking i kept really good care of it and as long as you do the same you should have no problem with it. i did however have to fix the mic it came loose but all i did was superglue it back on and no problems after that
B001ROZIA0|5.0|Another great romantic story.  I like Diane Lane as an actress anyway, but she sizzles with these two paticular male love interests.  I wouldn't mind having something like this happening to myself...
B000O8OTNC|5.0|before i bought this i watch some product review for it and it seemed to have some very good reviews and for my person opinion it is great. although while sharping one of my knifes it seemed to make the blade jagged but i i think that was just the blade itself overall very great buy
B008YW5RH2|5.0|this is just to much fun.  all you have to do is swipe your finger.  great for all ages.  just waiting for a hockey version.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|Difficult to really find a way to care about these awful people, but it's watchable nonetheless. The saving grace is Maggie Smith.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|the acting, plot, and direction, are all top notch. and there are beautiful rendered zombies. what is not to love?
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This movie had me moved.  Cried a lot at the end.  Anything that deals with love, respect, admiration, gratitude, tears well up for me.  I guess I'm weird like that but this movie and it's story of courage, the will to survive, blah blah blah, moved me so much than any other movie.  I am planning to purchase this now.  It deserves a space in my 'must have' collection of blurays.
B002ZG997M|4.0|The power of God's word and what if it were rare. Makes anyone think about its authority. I would have given this five stars but I was expecting a companion DVD with it for those rare moments when Blu-ray wasn't available. Otherwise, a great deal.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea is amazing as always. I love every song and his expressive interpretation of each one. I have never been disappointed with his music.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|I'm not a Michael Jackson fanatic but this is undeniably his master piece. I also got a great deal on the MP3 set too!
B00BF123WG|4.0|It was amazing to learn the amount of time that went into this case as well as the events that led to the elimination of the former most wanted man.  Very good movie.
B004TYOTAA|5.0|It pairs well with my classic 7th generation ipod. Enjoy being able to listen to my ipod thru my bluetooth headphones.
B0010T56J0|5.0|This movie, based on the life of the pianist David Helfgott, was acting at its best. Geoffrey Rush was extraordinary, as were Armin Mueller-Stahl and Lynn Redgrave. In fact, all the supporting actors contributed significantly to the telling of this story. What impressed me most, though, was Rush's command of the keyboard. He really made it seem like he was Helfgott when he sat at the keyboard. His piano lessons really paid off! Having studied classical piano myself, I could appreciate the challenges inherent in playing such an accomplished musician. It was a very moving and beautifully portrayed movie. I highly recommend it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|A witty and updated take on Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson that's nicely balanced with humor, mystery and a touch of action.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game it would be better if it was like the computer version but there are perm's to it like stone cutters I play on the PC and it is great.I highly recommend this game but the PC is 10x better if you only have 7 bucks then it is a great alliterative to the PC Mojang outdid themselves again
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|This is a great movie to watch with the family, but be prepared as it is a long movie. Awesome!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is just amazing, no more words needed. I just can't wait till the movie to come out! I really hope they don't mess it up.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I loved this CD...It has a whole New Sound than I am used to...!!! I actually bought one for My Daughter she loved it Sooo much too...!!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game but the google version seems to get updates way more often.  Amazon version finally got an update so I no longer had to look at the Christmas scene during startup.
B009CYCF5I|5.0|I love this New CD of PINK...!!! I have been a Fan of her Music for Years & always believed she was going to get even More Popular...!!! Gotta go to one of her Concerts...!!!
B00466HN72|5.0|such a cute movie, my son is 4.5 now and saw this last year when he was 3, he still loves it and it even great for adults to watch. Very cute and funny :)
141970642X|5.0|The Whimpy Kid series is Great...!!! I have bought the Boxed Sets for two of My Grandchildren...!!! I have continued to buy them every time a New One that comes Out...This is One I bought three of as several of My Grandchildren were inspired by their brothers love of this Book & wanted to Express themselves too...!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have been captivated with the story of and the characters in Downton Abbey.<br />I am eagerly awaiting the release of Season 3.
B00BDZV93I|3.0|This album is only worthy of 3 stars. The singles were the only strong tracks on the album. Wayne needs to stick to his hip hop roots that got him this far.. (he tries to go heavy metal on a track) the beats are alright at best and some of them are plain trash. And he needs to quit talking about Pü$$Y so much. That gets old pretty quick. Still have to give him a lot of credit for most of his lyrics & wordplay. Definetly buy the DLX edition if you decide to buy this album. It has a couple of the stronger joints. All in all.. ok album.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The storyline was well plotted out. Lots of scary moments.  The puzzles were well planned and just hard enough to make you think.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I think it's a very good game, it's FUN:) and it is very challenging, they give a lot of lives.
B001FXCE46|5.0|Love their sound and I dont think I have heard a bad song yet. Will be purchasing their other albums soon!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|The game is the bomb diggity. It has sharks and stuff and like you eat fish and stuff. It's nice
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford and Sons isn for everyone but my wife likes them so I bought her their first album. All I got was &#34;What about the second one?&#34;...lol
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Its very fun I makes you MAD but in a good way. It's make you wanna keep playing it for ever. So get this game it's awesome
B007P3TMW2|4.0|I'm always glad to see a movie with Hanks in it.  Story is about a little boy coming to terms with his best friend's death...his father.  Sad.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this game for my Grandkids to have on their Kindle Fires.  They are absolutely having a ball.  They have managed to sync all 4 kindles so all 4 kids can see what the other one is doing, they can play in teams or alone.  The only thing is you do need the internet to sync to another game.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Suspenseful to the end.  Great acting.  Great story.  Made me laugh sometimes too.  Commentary by Jimmy Carter after the movie was enlightening...he wanted to take some credit.
B008N1V11U|5.0|it was so long to download but it was totally worth it but 6.99 is rediculous for a kindle game
B007BLDFWG|3.0|Cultist chauvinistic male warps mind of impressionable young woman.  Physical escape is easier than recovering mentally.  Not everything is as it seems.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed the Hunger Games.  It was way better than I expected.  I thought it was going to be another kind of dopey kids' movie but it was much more than that.  The underlying themes and issues make you think a lot.  Jennifer Lawerence was Great and the drama was exciting.  A long movie that you don't want to end.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Terrific chase scenes, unbelievable situations; this story has a twist.  Was pretty good, not great.  Bond is now a bit long in the tooth.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Not the highest quality sound, but good enough for your smart phone! I like it very much and I like the fact that I can stream.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I'm a hardcore believer that the book is ALWAYS better than the movie, but this one is a toss-up for me! The acting was absolutely fantastic, the special effects were amazing, the directing was perfect, the editing made everything flow so well... I could go on and on, but you really should see it for yourself! I still suggest that you read the book (if you haven't already!), but this is such a great movie that I won't hold it against you if you don't. Watch Life of Pi, you won't be disappointed! :)
B001FXCE46|4.0|I'd down loaded a couple of their songs a year ago and decided to get the entire album.  Some of the songs I'd say are just okay, but overall it's good music to drive long distances to.
B0087HT36U|5.0|very challenging, very addictive just wish there a lot more levels I bet them all a few times already. but I love this game.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|It's not the same old Hollywood story.  It gives you something to think about. Content may not be right for young people.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|The dvd's are great.  The only disappointment I had was in the quality of the green dvd folders.  They're a bit thin and very brital and easy to crack whil you're trying to get the wrapper and covers off the case.  That's the only improvement I could suggest for the product.
B005KAH7QU|2.0|The movie started out promising, looking like it would be a high action fighting intense action flick, but I fell apart in the middle.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|It was received timely, and in new condition as advertised, however, I didn't care for the movie - I found it to be very depressing.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Very fun to play. Steering takes a bit to get used to. Great graphics. So I'm just trying to get enough coins for good powerhouse.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|I Think the the first one was better and this would have been left alone with just the first showing.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I really love this game!!!!!!! I still wonder if i will get the rainbow dragon.......  i recommend this game so much
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Would like to see a animated radar map so I can tell which direction the fronts are going or coming and how I might be affected.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|This book was incredibly detailed, however, it was very anti-climactic. Unlike Eclipse, there were no fights or battles, and half of the time it was just Bella sleeping. I also thought that Bella's giving birth to Renesme was a little too graphic. I definitely could do without the gory details. Being a PotterHead (Harry Potter fan) I am biased in saying this book wasn't as great as everyone says, but I do recommend this book if you like romance an unstable plot. This book is decent, but it does not fulfill the plethora of action suitable to my liking, but it is a detailed and graphic read. I won't say it's the best book in the universe, but I won't say it's the worst book, either.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very fun game. You can have over 20 different games going at once and survival and creative are the best. Does NOT have animals that YOU can spawn (like the xbox or computer version) but does have animals to eat. GET THIS APP!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my horse its fun I play all the time I plash it in the car I just love my horse its
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I read this book during all of the hacking that was reported in the Far East, and it rang very true. Cyber warfare is the biggest threat to America at this time. This book brings it home with a loud and clear message. Shivers ran down my spine as I read about the havoc that could be brought against infrastructure and security. A great Clancy novel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horse could have been more realistic but with how much I love horses it doesn't matter I love it any ways cause it's so cool
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really good,though it is quite addictive so watch out, but I would definitely advise you to get it as it is very good and always keeps up with what season and that is like now you have to collect eggs for a reward seeing as it is Easter.
B0086700CM|5.0|its pretty fricken shaweet. temple run 2 is also bawler!! and its FREE so why not? I wish you could change the character though. maybe you can, but I haven't figured it out yet...
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Definitely not worth it, doesn't have any plot and isn't very funny. Not even close too as funny as knocked up
B00B2V66VS|5.0|still wish you could change the characterbbut its very cool. there are more powerups and a rickety mine shaft thing which is cool.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|You can't get all five pages they are hard to find and slender man looks like he is having a seasher... sorry for the spelling mistakes I'm only 10 YEARS OLD :(
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I love the movie and the extended version of it is even better! I absolutely love this item and would buy it for my parents
B00992CF6W|5.0|Please check out  minecraft for noobs lol fest. It is cool<br /><br />And also try out LukeMol 2001. It is YouTube channel
B0063IH60K|5.0|What can you say about solitaire? It was fun for me to pass the time when I was in school and now my 9 and 12 year old boys do the same lol
B0084670FU|3.0|Too much theme music for me. Hard to follow at times. Would not recommend to a friend, unless you had nothing todo.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I just cannot with this book. It's perfect. If you're on the fence, or think it's a typical teenager/girl book, you're wrong. This book can relate to anyone anywhere. Although the characters are young, they are humans, and it's obvious throughout the book that this isn't just some trite novel.

B005ES0XQY|5.0|that good
B009X01GJ2|3.0|The quality of this product is excellent. The concept that allows you to rotate your Kindle so you can view in landscape or portrait mode is great. However, this cover with the Kindle installed is extremely heavy and makes it uncomfortable to hold. Therefore, I would not recommend this cover.
B0018O51LU|3.0|We didnt realize or understand the regions.  We will start to pay very close attention to that.<br /><br />Your product was in new condition.<br /><br />Our fault for not noticing, because it is listed.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|GREAT movie!  GREAT music!!  Movie followed the on-stage<br />performance closely.  Music nearly as good as the O2<br />Anniversary CD!  Worth the price!!
B001NLCBJI|5.0|This movie is simply one of the best movies of all time.  Sophia Coppola hit a home run in her writing and directing of this film.  Although stereotypical in many aspects of Japan, all those ring true to any visitor to Tokyo, especially a first time visitor.  I even visited the Park Hyatt where some bar scenes were filmed, and to my surprise, the bar is in real life is almost the same.  A must purchase DVD or Bluray to watch over and over.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Best movie I have seen in a while Denzel Washington played his character perfectly, Overall this movie was awesome definitely a must-see!

B005LAIHCM|1.0|Remember \\"Disturbia\\"? It had the gall to reimagine Alfred Hitchcock's classic \\"Rear Window\\" as a teen slasher movie, starring a pre-\\"Transformers\\" Shia Labeouf in James Stewart's stead.<br /><br />Why do I bring this up? Because \\"House at the End of the Street\\" might as well be a sequel to \\"Disturbia,\\" since it takes the same tack of trying to turn a classic Hitchcock movie into a teen horror movie. The one thing that it has going for it is that instead of Shia Labeouf, this movie has the always-wonderful Jennifer Lawrence -- and at times, she feels like its sole saving grace.<br /><br />Elissa Cassidy (Lawrence) and her newly-divorced mom Sarah (Elisabeth Shue) have just moved into their dream home, in an idyllic upper-crust community full of selfish snobs. Elissa isn't particularly enthusiastic about their new life, but she quickly makes some friends and even is recruited into a rock band at her school (which allows Jennifer Lawrence a chance to show off her lovely singing voice).<br /><br />But there's a dark side to their neighborhood. Four years ago, Carrie Ann Jacobson slaughtered her parents and seemingly drowned herself -- and now the only living member of the family is Ryan (Max Thieriot), a shy young man who is despised by the whole neighborhood. Why? He's driving their property values down. Seriously.<br /><br />Despite Sarah's wishes, Elissa becomes intrigued by Ryan, and even sneaks off to spend time with him in his abandoned house. But Elissa doesn't know what Ryan has been hiding in the basement, and what might happen if she were to learn the secrets he's been keeping. When she figures out the truth, Elissa becomes a prisoner facing a fate worse than death.<br /><br />\\"House at the End of the Street\\" is a pretty shameless ripoff of Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho,\\" minus the stuff that was (and is) actually shocking. In fact, director Mark Tonderai seems kind of uncomfortable with incorporating some of that stuff into the story -- he's particularly clumsy with the \\"mental illness\\" and \\"cross-dressing\\" aspects -- but is all too happy to blatantly rip off some parts of it (the final scene).<br /><br />Then again, those moments tend to be the most effective in the movie. Tonderai isn't much of a director, with no real style to his work -- he just follows Lawrence around while scary music plays. Also: blonde girls running through the woods at night ARE NOT SCARY.<br /><br />And as a story, \\"House\\" is resolutely mediocre -- it's standard Hollywood suspense populated by stock characters, with a lot of narrative contrivances tied together in so many knots. The dialogue is weak, and a number of the characters really have no reason to be in the movie. For instance, why is Elissa's new best friend in here again? The character adds nothing, and she fades out completely in the second half of the movie.<br /><br />As the final indignity, major plot points turn into gaping plot holes -- for instance, we NEVER find out why the sheriff is so desperate to protect Ryan. It's just a dramatic device that collapses on itsefl<br /><br />The one saving grace of this movie is Lawrence, who is doing a pretty phenomenal job with a fairly standard horror heroine -- she comes across as a clever but overconfident girl who doesn't know quite as much as she thinks she does. Shue just stand around looking worried. And Thieriot's entire performance is a third-rate Tony Perkins impression -- it's so obvious just from his performance what is going on!<br /><br />\\"House at the End of the Lane\\" is an embarrassingly clunky movie, imitating random parts of \\"Psycho\\" but tailoring it to Mark Tonderai's limited skills.

0553381407|5.0|Unafraid, this book cracks right open the things society and our parents try to ignore. It boldly places blame where blame is due, and gives you the comfort to know that you are not responsible for what was done to you as a helpless child.<br />Whether you were emotionally, verbally, or physically abused this book CAN help you. It helped me stop blaming myself, and helped me give up the unrealistic hope that my parents would eventually change.<br />I am grateful that I stumbled onto this life changing book.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This is a true classic and has a great message - every should see this film at some point in their lives so that you will know you have an impact oin someone's life.

B0085OELXK|5.0|This movie is superbly written. Matt Damon is exquisite in his acting; so much so that he has you rooting for his character (although he is evil). This film captivates you from the first scene to the very last minute. Wonderful screenplay.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Well-acted thought provoking film.  Very intense near the end; you will be on the edge of your seat during the raid.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I was captivated by the way the story developed and how it progressed.  I am a WWII history buff and this was a story I was not aware.  I am certainly pleased that I was given the opportunity to read the details of this true act of humanitarianism.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in WWII history.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I recently watched this movie, and greatly enjoyed it. I know it has been out for a long time and it won awards, but I was probably one of the few people left that had not heard about it and did not know what it was about. So I went into it not knowing anything about it, and I think that is what made it truly enjoyable to me. So, if by any chance you don't know how the movie ends, I recommend that you stop reading, get the movie, and watch it!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I believe that Chris has captured the essence of the right mind set to be a success at war.<br />A real shame as to how his life ended

B001OSIV62|5.0|For me, this movie is like a favorite song I can not stop playing over and over.<br />Inspiring on so many levels.  My son loves this movie and my Mom too :)<br />\\"It's impossible, that's sure, so let's start working!\\"
B000HSKUBE|5.0|This is a very clever series that shows just how devious some politicians can be, and in some cases totally immoral. As it is set in Britain, you get a view of British parliament. However, it is very easy to picture similiar situations in America. I highly recommend watching the whole series.
B001JFZ118|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie..fun and action pack.<br />The music was great Queen and add more too the movie.<br />It was nice to watch.

B008V1IR4Q|5.0|I have spent years collecting Cortot recordings. Some of the items I've purchased were $20 per cd. This collection is a tremendous bargain!<br /><br />Cortot was indeed a master craftsman- a poet of the piano. Simply peruse one of his study editions of, for instance, the Chopin Etudes, and you will realize that he had a deep and passionate understanding of this music. He understood it technically, but also interpretively. His recorded legacy is one of the world's great musical treasures.<br /><br />The only significant missing item here is the late Munich recitals from the 1950's. Those are interesting mainly for color, as technically Cortot was not at his best. I do, however, adore the preludes from this recital.<br /><br />This collection, however, is SUPREME. You get all of the significant chamber recordings. Some of the works are staples (the Schumann, Haydn, Schubert, Beethoven). However, we also get Debussy's violin sonata, as well as Franck, Faure, and Saint-Saens in chamber works. You get Cortot the conductor in Brahm's Double Concerto (a gem), and the first ever complete recording of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos (surprisingly lush and beautifully played). There are also art songs by Schumann and Debussy (including Dichterliebe, another gem). Cortot and Maggie Teyte are fantastic in Debussy's art songs.<br /><br />The solo recordings are of great interest here. You get multiple recordings of the same works, and this is the true prize in this collection. It is not a redundancy. In fact, it is revelatory for the collector. If you are interested in Cortot, it is fascinating to compare his different recordings of the same work. These are unedited and unspliced; therefore you always get the artist's full conception of the work. You get to hear Chopin Preludes from the 1950's, the 1940's, the 1930's, and the 1920's. You get a very fast version of the Liszt sonata (but still the first ever recording in history of this masterpiece). You get Cortot's concerto recordings (Chopin, Ravel, Saint-Saens, and Schumann). His Chopin is stunning, poetic, colorful. His Schumann tempestuous, lyrical, and vibrant. I adore his take on Kresleriana (here you get all of the recordings he made of this work). It is a vital recording, full of ardour and madness. He takes a lot of risks with his Schumann, and his playing is exciting and daring here. Really wonderful.<br /><br />Some of the works in which Cortot's mastery shines through:<br />Liszt: Hungarian Rhapsody 11<br />Ravel: Jeux D'eau, Sonatine<br />Schumann: Carnaval, Etudes, Kreisleriana, Concerto<br />Chopin: Barcarolle, Berceuse, Complete Preludes, Complete Etudes, Waltzes, Piano Concerto 2, Fantasy in F Minor, Sonatas (2 & 3), Ballades (I adore his reading from 1933 of the 4th)<br />Debussy: Preludes<br />Miniatures from Chabrier, Faure, Saint-Saens.<br /><br />There are many other treasures here. Get this set while it is available (I would guess that the release is a fairly limited one, but I do not know for sure). EMI took a bold move with this release, but for fans of Cortot or anyone interested in collecting historic piano recordings this is a steal (2 dollars per disc). A tremendous homage to a pianistic titan.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a nice game to play. It makes you think, but its not so hard that you can't move forward. I got it for free, and my husband is jealous. :D

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I bought this for my sister for her birthday which has not happened yet.  But she & I have watched this classic many, many times since its release to theaters in the &#34;70's.  Not only is this an all-time classic of film making, but it will always be THE movie I have shared with my wonderful sister/friend.<br />When we open and view, I will send another review about the product.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Heart gripping suspenseful captivating enlightening true experience of Heaven .  One that gives hope and belief that there is more to life than this existence. Amazing.

B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Nice compact book with very simple yet hard and powerfull suggestions for a more balanced life. Impeccable word, sounds easy doesn't it but look carefully at your everyday life and just look, listen and see how easy it is to slide away...
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is a wonderful new story, different from others of this Genre. As I read each sequel, I could not wait to get to the next. I loved the story and all the characters are endearingly lovable with their quirks and unending loyalty. Even the villains, I loved to hate. I've read the entire series and was looking for another book, disappointed that the story ended in that wonderfully made up world. 5 stars for the entire series, it is so worth your time. Don't miss out.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Oh how I love this season, Will and Alicia get closer and closer.  And I can't honetly say what is so attracting about them, because you know it's wrong of them, but man is it hot in the same sense!

B000001EG6|5.0|This has five songs which can fairly be called &#34;Art&#34; songs in the best possible sense. All are ballads with wonderful lyrics/ stories; beautiful instumentation, including lush strings, a harp, harpsichord, piano, and solo guitar, and fine melodies...These songs are:&#34;Your Song&#34;;  &#34;I Need You to Turn to&#34;; &#34;....Hienton&#34;; &#34;Sixy Years on&#34;, and the &#34;Greatest Discovery&#34;...Just as timeless now as in 1970!..And the lyrics are in the booklet as well! Others range from &#34;Good&#34; (&#34;Border Song&#34;); to not so good &#34;Take me to the Pilot&#34; ...Way back when many, like myself, even thought Elton could be a potential successor to Lennon/McCartney/Harrison, who had broken up around then (1970)..This was not to be, when for various reasons  (perhaps more commercial than artistic), Elton became the outrageous and wacky performer/ songster,mainly of 2nd rate thumpers (say &#34;Crocodile Rock&#34; or &#34;Philadelphia Freedom&#34;,etc.)..But this CD album still has some great and timeless tunes!
B0091REZMW|2.0|really lame game slow response time even with an awesome internet connection. have already sent it back to the cloud.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I do think there are challenges in the video, though. It seems to like to &#34;cut out&#34; at the end and it tells me to come back another time or something like that. I have to get out and resume...just a nuisance sometimes...but the show itself is very fine.
1595825045|5.0|It's a great book for fans of Avatar, there's a lot of concepts and sketches. Also, we can take a look at the originals concepts, and therefore compare with de animated art.

B004LX0D36|5.0|After reading Pride and Prejudice, I was sad it was over, so I bought the movie from Amazon.  After watching that a couple of times, I decided it was time to read another Jane Austin book and decided on Sense and Sensibility.  Again a truly wonderful story and clear depiction of the times.  Read it and you too will become a great fan of this English classic.

B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|The movie was entertaining but it felt way too drawn out with scenes that weren't even in the book. This movie &#34;trilogy&#34; could have been wrapped up in one movie (two max).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book so much I don't even know how to review it, I just want to scream TRUST ME AND READ THIS BECAUSE YOU WON'T REGRET IT! The way this author develops a story is beyond entertaining, you will literally go without sleep and other necessities for longer than usual because u just can't put it down! The entire plot is awesome, the love story is so strong, the characters are so loveable and every part of this book feels like it's REAL LIFE and not some fictional fairy tale that you've basically read three thousand different versions of! It will provoke every emotion imaginable but you will still continue to adore it! The author of this book deserves more praise than I know how to give, the way she connects the twists and turns in the story back to each other in such a profound and perfect way is not a talent many authors could ever claim to have and even the best author's wish they could do it the way the author of this book does! I will be strongly recommending this book to all of my friends, anyone who asks for a recommendation and anyone who reads this review! I look forward to reading more books by this author! Awesome job Colleen Hoover...Bravo!

B009JZWO3I|5.0|While not quite rising to the level of a series such as the original Law and Order, the Good Wife offers a great mix of entertaining legal cases, and an interesting ongoing dramatic background story staged primarily in a Chicago law firm and Chicago/Illinois politics. The writing, directing and acting are all quit good. The episodes also contain a good dose of suspense and a bit of comedy as well.<br /><br />I think The Good Wife will appeal to most folks who enjoy legal dramas generally and certainly those who enjoyed Boston Legal.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Great book with resources. It is well written, clear and focused. Lay people can read and understand it and you can also take it to your physician to get her or him to help you or at least get out of your way and not hurt you. I recommend it and I have given it to several people including my doctor.
B00BEYYO8U|5.0|The Daniel Craig movies have really injected new life into the James Bond franchise, but \\"Skyfall\\" is possibly one of the best Bond movies EVER.<br /><br />This movie is not just a brilliant Bond movie, or a brilliant spy thriller, but a brilliant movie in general -- beautifully filmed, combining the old-school James Bond formula with a very 21st-century brand of terrorism. But what truly elevates this beautiful movie is Sam Mendes' focus on both Bond and M, and the terrible costs of living their lives.<br /><br />A hard drive containing information on double agents is stolen in Istanbul, and Bond (Daniel Craig) nearly manages to get it back. But he's accidentally shot by Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and presumed dead. He's not dead, obviously -- but he uses this as a chance to retire to a tropical island.<br /><br />But then MI6 is hacked by a cyberterrorist, and their headquarters is blown up. Bond reappears in London to offer his services to his country again, but he's obviously not fit for duty -- physically or psychologically. Despite this, M (Judi Dench) sends him back out to find the cyberterrorists before more agents are killed.<br /><br />The trail leads him to Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former agent who specializes in cyberterrorism. He blames M for his torture and mutilation, and is determined to destroy her career before killing her. Even capturing Silva isn't enough to stop him, and soon Bond must flee London with M to make a final stand against Silva.<br /><br />If there is a underlying question to \\"Skyfall,\\" it is this: Does an old-fashioned agent like James Bond belong in a world of cyberterrorism and individual extremism? Well, yes. The nature of conflict, evil and cruelty will never change, only the media through which they are spread. It's expressed in a lovely speech by M, which seems to say, \\"So what if it's the age of Bourne and Fast & Furious? Bond is timeless.\\"<br /><br />But Sam Mendes does sow some seeds of doubt about the \\"old guard\\" -- M is coming to the end of her tenure, and Bond is beginning to crumble from the physical and mental damage he's taken over the years.<br /><br />Mendes' direction is truly spellbinding. The action is gritty and often brutal, but set against backdrops of breathtaking beauty -- a nighttime apartment lit by glowing jellyfish, Bond drifting on a boat surrounded by luminous paper lanterns, and the creaky polished beauty of Skyfall itself. But he never lets us forget the brutality of the villain's ways, such as when the token Bond girl is brutally shot in the head.<br /><br />The movie also takes the chance to dip into the relationship between M and Bond. They have an untrusting, almost antagonistic relationship, with Bond knowing he cannot truly trust M, but also knowing that she does what must be done. And as he encounters Silva, Bond begins to see the creature he could choose to become, but his essential decency holds him back.<br /><br />Craig and Dench rule this movie, and both of them are blisteringly good -- they give stoic performances with strong emotions roiling under the surface. Craig's performance is particularly brilliant -- this is a Bond aching and riddled with scars, but he still has the strength he needs. He also has some deliciously sensual scenes with Naomie Harris. Shaving never looked so hot.<br /><br />But who can forget Javier Bardem? He also gives a glorious performance as Silva, a flamboyant cyberterrorist who hides his hate under a perpetually laughing face. Only when confronted by the woman he wants to kill does he show his true rage.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" is not just a brilliant James Bond movie, but a brilliant movie -- in action, in writing, in direction and in character. The next Bond movie will have a tough act to follow.-- M is coming to the end of her tenure, and Bond is beginning to crumble from the physical and mental damage he's taken over the years.<br /><br />Mendes' direction is truly spellbinding. The action is gritty and often brutal, but set against backdrops of breathtaking beauty -- a nighttime apartment lit by glowing jellyfish, Bond drifting on a boat surrounded by luminous paper lanterns, and the creaky polished beauty of Skyfall itself. But he never lets us forget the brutality of the villain's ways, such as when the token Bond girl is brutally shot in the head.<br /><br />The movie also takes the chance to dip into the relationship between M and Bond. They have an untrusting, almost antagonistic relationship, with Bond knowing he cannot truly trust M, but also knowing that she does what must be done. And as he encounters Silva, Bond begins to see the creature he could choose to become, but his essential decency holds him back.<br /><br />Craig and Dench rule this movie, and both of them are blisteringly good -- they give stoic performances with strong emotions roiling under the surface. Craig's performance is particularly brilliant -- this is a Bond aching and riddled with scars, but he still has the strength he needs. He also has some deliciously sensual scenes with Naomie Harris. Shaving never looked so hot.<br /><br />But who can forget Javier Bardem? He also gives a glorious performance as Silva, a flamboyant cyberterrorist who hides his hate under a perpetually laughing face. Only when confronted by the woman he wants to kill does he show his true rage.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" is not just a brilliant James Bond movie, but a brilliant movie -- in action, in writing, in direction and in character. The next Bond movie will have a tough act to follow.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|It's never the money that I fee bad about when I make a poor pick of a book. It's the time lost. That was never an issue and I'm glad I read this classic. The story is deep and complex but written in a style that reads easily. Looking forward to reading more PKD in the near future.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|Tim Burton is a very hit-or-miss director -- when he's good, he's very very good. And when he's bad... \\"Planet of the Apes.\\"<br /><br />And for many years, he and favorite star Johnny Depp wanted to make an adaptation of the classic supernatural soap \\"Dark Shadows.\\" Except, you know, getting virtually every aspect of the story wrong -- instead of a tale of vampiric tragedy and suspense, we get an awful sitcom that tries to get all its humor from Barnabas Collins being a \\"man out of time.\\"<br /><br />About two hundred years ago, the witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) took revenge on her former lover Barnabas Collins (Depp) after he jilted her. She killed his family, made his fiancee commit suicide, turned him into a vampire, and got him buried for two hundred years.<br /><br />When Barnabas is accidentally dug up, it's the 1970s. After snacking on some road workers, he heads straight back to the old family manor. The Collins family -- led by the dour matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) -- has seen its fortunes decline over the centuries, and Barnabas is determined to restore them. He also immediately falls for Victoria (Bella Heathcote), who is an exact doppelganger for his dead fiancee.<br /><br />However, it turns out that Angelique is still kicking around because... well, she's a witch, so apparently that makes her immortal. She's still carrying a torch for Barnabas. And she's been responsible for the family \\"curse.\\" And, well, she's opened a rival fish cannery that is threatening the old family biz. When Barnabas turns her down again, she's out for revenge...<br /><br />If you've seen even some of Tim Burton's other movies, then you know pretty much what to expect from \\"Dark Shadows.\\" Burton is just regurgitating the same things he always does -- it stars Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter, there's pancake makeup with sunken raccoon eyes, a Skellington scarecrow, gothic houses with lots of sharp angles, wild hair, etc.<br /><br />Burton's style is not the problem, though... but the fact that he turned a story of tragedy and revenge into a COMEDY is. And even as a comedy, it fails.<br /><br />Instead we get endless gags relying on Barnabas' culture shock (oh ha ha, he's confused by the TV), and how he's so obviously a vampire but the Collins clan never notices. And once the backstory is out of the way, Burton seems to lose interest in the plot -- he simply flings around a dozen random plot threads, culminating in a confusing deus-ex-machina climax with random ghosts and werewolves popping up to fight Angelique.<br /><br />There's also an ugly misogynistic tone to the movie -- every woman is either a vengeful scorned harpy who can't move on, a vain age-obsessed skank or a blank-faced nonentity like Victoria.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is admittedly doing what he can here, but the character of Barnabas is just embarrassing -- he comes across as a blithering idiot and a huge cad. Depp is charming, but not charming enough. Heathcote has the charisma and acting ability of a log, and most of the other actors are wasted (Pfeiffer, Green, Chloë Grace Moretz, Jonny Lee Miller).<br /><br />It boggles the imagination that \\"Dark Shadows\\" was made by actual fans of the original TV show, because frankly it's hard to imagine a worse adaptation being made by people who hated it. There may be shadows, but they're not dark. They're just beige.m, though... but the fact that he turned a story of tragedy and revenge into a COMEDY is.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Isaakson has a wonderful ability to be sufficiently present so that the story is told....but he presciently keeps out of the way of the great story being told.  I read this one with the attention of a teenager....he and it deserved that attention and rewarded that attention.

B009AMANH4|1.0|The story of Lincoln, one of our greatest presidents has all the elements for a great movie.  However, this Speilberg version is a mess.  The story line is often uninteresting, then wanders and will lose the viewer at times.  It is a good movie to watch if you want something to put you to sleep. In Speilberg's early career, he made some great movies.  Don't know what happened to him on this one, but he was obviously out to lunch.  If you want to watch it, I would suggest that you spend $5 and rent it first.  If you happen to like it then spend $20 plus bucks to own it.  I stepped up and spent the $20 plus dollars to own it (sight unseen), which was a real mistake and a was total waste of money.  I will likely throw it in the rubbish where it belongs, because I have no desire to ever view it again.
0385474547|2.0|Read this novel told from one tribal man's perspective on Friday night. It begins by developing the main character's persona by way of explaining the type of man his father was and how in backlash his son has grown to be just the opposite. Most of his fears and bad behavior are a reaction against becoming the kind of man his father was. We are then treated to plot progression- daily life over time in their village including interactions with other tribes and tribal customs including a gruesome murder. Later in the story the plot focus shifts to the interaction between the tribe and christian missionaries that have come to convert the tribe.<br /><br />I suppose the story was moderately interesting but I never connected with any of the characters and so for me, the novel failed. I stood on the outside of the author's world b/c he never successfully drew me in to identify or sympathize with any of his characters. The main character was too one-sided and awful to establish rapport with readers and no other characters were developed sufficiently to prompt a connection.

It's easy and works great but if I add a location that's very far from where I live it says &quot;unable to find location.&quot; So i do it again an  then it works but it is kind of a hassle to do it twice. But I still love this app and recommend it to others.

B0094K1MH2|5.0|Heartily recommend this move.  I think you will be surprised by the unique animation and chase season.  All very clever and a visual pleasure.  Enjoyed it so much I bought it for my library.  It has an excellent story line, good characterization
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Only app to access NAS drive.  Big negative is, doesn't show thumbnail or other info about file, making it difficult to navigate.  Can't sort files either. But the only app I've found so far.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Excellent story telling, very clever tie-in to many old school arcade games.<br />The ending is a little predictable but story has a well-done plot surprise that showed they really put some thought into the story and not just animation as is often done.

0062215507|3.0|I don't know if this is an isolated incident from Amazon, but I received a book with a missing attached page (the Hogsmeade page)! I checked with my friend who owns another version of the book, and there's supposed to be a candy cardboard page attached. But mine has a missing page with dried glue residue! It's such an inconvenience, and I'd hate to return it and wait for a new one to arrive. Another thing is, the Marauder's Map had a small tear in the upper left mid-corner. I was going to keep this as a collector's item, but I figured I should just buy one at B&B for a higher price. But I'm sure the item won't be defective there.<br /><br />Material-wise, I think it's a great book! The attached props were amazingly detailed. Just beware of Amazon.<br /><br />4 stars for the product, 3 stars for the service.
B0083EM24C|5.0|Super catchy poppy great music from a great band! Really enjoy this album pretty much anytime of the day and NO the played out track thats on the commercials is NOT the best song on this album, a good one, but there are so many more! All fun and catchy too!
B004OZZ624|5.0|And I really liked it. Director/Writer Haggis is at his best keeping the suspense taut yet believable. Character is key and Crowe and Elizabeth Banks both work their scenes to maximum effect. This is not Taken or even worse Taken 2, where  the plot line is both contrived and a flimsy excuse for the protagonist to strut his prowess. Though Liam Neeson does show up in a brief cameo to set the stage and plant a red herring or two. We saw it with another couple and while the four of us span a fairly broad range of expectations (one of whom, my wife, even enjoyed the hyberbolic Taken) it kept us all engaged. It's hard to find a movie that has this level of detail and character development yet keeps the action and pace moving.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Sabotage came at a tricky time in Sabbath's career. Vocalist Ozzy Osbourne,guitarist Tony Iommi,bassist Geezer Butler,and drummer Bill Ward were a few years away from their eventual demise,but this doesnt mean they didnt have a last hurrah. Ignoring the disasters that were Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die,Sabbath brings us the last great one two punch of british heavy metal we know and love. Songs like Meglomania,Thrill of it All,and Hole in the Sky remind us why this band mattered. Bill Ward drums like he has a few minutes left to live,Geezer slaps the bass with a passion,Tony throws a hundred new riffs in our face,and Ozzy belts out passionate lyrics we definitely wouldnt find in his solo career. With that,Sabotage is worth a listen and definitely stands the test of time when placed beside some of Sabbaths later work. Need i remind you of Seventh Star?
B008X8QCTO|5.0|The hidden object games are my favorite!! This game is great in story line, detail and interactive parts! Very well done and played several times in a row! Thank you

B00BNWWVFG|4.0|***No spoilers follow***<br />Sure there are a few things that don't quite follow, but if you are a fan of the old Hitchcock and Twilight Zone episodes, you will appreciate this suspenseful puzzler of a movie. Centered around a psychiatrist, his depressed patient, and a fictional medication, things devolve into a murder which we witness. From there, we are never quite sure what is true and what is not. Entertaining, suspenseful, and sure, a few loose ends but who's counting? A fun way to spend an evening, and after the show, you can explain the twists to our companion!
B00BG08FKK|3.0|In a previous review of mine, I trashed the Highlights CD as being the worst recording I have ever heard (and I own 10). If taken by itself, this album isn't that bad (though Russell Crowe can't sing and Hugh Jackman murdered \\"Bring Me Home\\"). The rest of the album is OK. I listened to the entire thing on a trip back from Pittsburgh and didn't howl too badly. ;-)
B002UEW31I|5.0|I am Jewish,  my mother's family were killed in Auschwitz, so of course I loved the movie even though it was fiction, but to be honest I am a really big fan of Quentin Tarantino's movies.

B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy the different types of puzzles. The only thing that would make it better is if you could change puzzle piece types/sizes.
B009ERK35W|1.0|Another terrible release from this awful budget company. 15Mbps AND the brightness levels are all messed up, making the release all but unwatchable. This is Cronenberg at his best and this film at least deserves a decent budget release. How can you honestly manipulate brightness levels like this, at a professional company, and then send this out the door like nothing is wrong with it? I mean, is there an ounce of QC at these companies?<br /><br />This same film by Cronenberg actually has a higher bitrate in the multi-packs it comes with! Get it there if you need it as the transfer is better too... the only problem there is you don't get lossless sound! No idea in hell who greenlights these transfers as if they are okay! They are not! A monkey at the controls could come up with something better than this. Why oh why?
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I play this on a kindle fire. Once a day I play this game and it freezes up after about 30 mins. I have no problem playing it on my phone; droid razor.
0802473156|5.0|We were required to read this during our premarital counseling years ago, and still to this day we recommend it to everyone we know.  It's not just for couples, it's a great book to learn about how we all love in different ways and how we can make sure we are loving those around us in a way where they feel loved.  I would recommend this book to everyone!

034580404X|4.0|I think that while the books are a bit smutty or racy, they have a great plot line and are very interesting. I highly recommend them. :)
B0086213XW|2.0|I have to admit that I was underwhelmed by this movie. I was really excited about it after reviewing the cast reading the synopsis. I thought the movie was long and drawn out. I did not really like the story and the characters were not relatable to me. I actually had to fast forward through some scenes because they were so drawn out. The actors were great, I love Michelle and Seth, but overall I really did not enjoy the movie and I found myself wanting it to be over about midway through.
B003NX75B8|4.0|So I'm I super huge fan of John Green, and a new fan of David Levithans, so I bought this book with high expectations.<br /><br />While it didn't change my life, and the heterosexual love was not near as juicy as the homosexual love (I would've enjoyed it more if there was equal amounts of awesome in both sexualities) it was still extremely good and I was sad when it ended.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|I always love the Evangelion franchise,which includes the rebuild series.Hence i immediately order the blue-ray versions of both 1.11 and 2.22.Delivery was real fast,it only took roughly 1 week and items were kept properly.The only problem i encountered was with Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone [Blu-ray] ,there ISN'T any guidebook!!!!!!!(As written at the back of cover)<br />Truly speaking,i am quite disappointed with this fact but luckily contents are great and i definitely love those extra scenes!<br />This item could easily be rated as 5 if only my guidebook didn't disappear nowhere...
B005TKD8ZK|3.0|First Murakami I've read and not terribly interesting - but I'm told his fiction is superb. Will give that a try instead.
B006Z7XNVK|5.0|The plot has been written about, so I'll just say that this movie is stunning. It slowly builds suspense and a foreboding of malice. Past and present are expertly intercut, as Martha runs from her memories until they catch up to her and overwhelm her. She reminds me a little of Linda Kassabian, who as a member of the Manson clan eventually woke up and turned against them, and in doing so re-discovered her humanity.<br /><br />MMMM is the story of a girl who becomes a victim, then a victimizer, and then a witness. It's also a study of missed opportunities and a lack of understanding into both ourselves and the behavior of the ones we love. I got so frustrated at Martha for not being able to put her trauma into words, and at her sister Lucy, who was trying so hard to assuage her own guilt at abandoning a young Martha that she ended up missing every clue that was put in front of her. The thing is, as frustrating as it was, it was also so real, so human in the imperfection of its characters, and that is reflected in the ending (or non-ending, as some critics consider it.) We've been trained to have our movies end neatly and clearly, with the ending we want to see, and I admit I feel the same way. I wish Martha had been able to express to Lucy what happened to her, I wish that Lucy had been able to really hear her... and I still wonder what that last five minutes really meant.<br /><br />Yet the best thing about Martha Marcy May Marlene is that I've watched it several times; I've become emotionally invested and have continued to think about it, which is more than I can say for most movies last year that got rave reviews. In the end, Martha Marcy Mae Marlene was utterly moving, well-written, beautifully acted, and I'm so glad that I saw it.

B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This is another fine album from Blake Shelton. This album is entitled \\"Based On True On A True Story\\".  Blake certainly can tell a story with his music.  He shares a little bit of his personality in each song.  \\"Boys Round Here\\" is a song where Blake  sings about how proud he is to be a country boy.  He enjoys talking about trucks and girls.  He also enjoys drinking beer.  Blake seems like a man that I would like to hang out with.  This is a very enjoyable first track.  My other favorite track \\"My Eyes.\\"  This is a song about a how a beautiful woman can make a man feel. \\"Doing What She Likes\\" is a song about all the little things that a man can do to make a woman feel special.  Blake provides me excellent tips I can use to find a girlfriend.  Many of these songs are love songs, but Blake sounds great singing them. \\"Still Got A Finger\\" is a song for all the people who work hard every day to make a living.  I know this a country album, but this song really rocks.  I love the spirit of this song very much. \\"Granddaddy's Gun\\" is another song I like.  Blake makes me believe that a gun is something I can be proud to pass on to the next generation.\\"Country On The Radio\\" is a song about how much Blake loves country music.  I love the banjo and fiddle playing on this track. \\"Sure Be Cool If You Did\\" is a song about how a special woman can change a man's life forever.  This song makes me feel hopeful that I will find a special woman soon. \\"Do You Remember\\" is a pretty song about remembering all the things that makes a man fall in love with a woman. I love this album.

B008FYZIVY|3.0|We are really enjoying this series.  In fact, it is so good that we had to order Season 3!!  But, the quality of the DVDs is questionable.  The picture fades into black on two or three of the disks.  I tried to check my order history about 10 days ago, but was unable to bring it up....and now it is too late to return them, so we are holding onto these &#34;limited edition&#34; DVDs...I didn't realize that was why the eition was limited!!
B000002AVF|5.0|I have to confess I bought this just for &#34;Fantasy&#34;, and that song alone is worth the purchase. I have her #1's CD, but the version of &#34;Fantasy&#34; on that one is a remix - boooo! So had to get the original. There is also &#34;Always Be My Baby&#34;. A must for any Mariah fan.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|While I liked the stage and how they presented the story through it, the acting took this movie down.  The interaction just did not pull you in and make it feel like it was authentic. The story line jumped around too much, I just cannot recommend this movie.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A truly awesome and engaging read that can keep you guessing. If you really pay attention to the story you can guess at what will happen, or at least have fun trying. I know I for one can't wait to read Die Trying =0)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Makes it easy for me to see how low my battery is in the notification bar, and alerts me when my battery gets down to 15%.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is really interesting.I really like creating new and exciting dragons. The only downside to this game is the extremely long amounts of time it take to do everything, like breeding, evolving and cutting down trees.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Thumbs up for free game with no ads.  I've played this game for many hours and gotten quite good.  I love the game and how it is structured.  The only problem I have with this app is that is sometimes crashes my Kindle.
B005K17RU0|5.0|With just a touch of my Kindle I can let the kids know what they should wear or bring to school.  Accuracy matters and AccuWeather delivers.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The content of this wonderful book allows one to explore their feelings and takes you through steps to reach the secrets of who you are and how you communicate.  In this same light, it allows  you to get to know your spouse/significant other's love language.  If only I had gotten this information years ago.  I think you can use the knowledge to better communicate in all relationships.
B007R0WHMK|4.0|It was certainly different. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a suspense/drama. Will keep you on the edge of your seat
B00BWJARHO|2.0|It was Ok. My kids fell asleep at the beginning of the movie. We are not really exited for the next part.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|They should seriously consider giving you /everybody free energy.Its bad enough that we have to make our own money.Its to hard to control all 5 things you have to.Thank goodness its free or you would be wasting your money!Its a good game though.:)
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|love the game except when the ads to purchase a better product of majong keeps constantly coming on.  don't even use it anymore.  wish i could return it.  live and learn
B009VL28W2|1.0|This DVD is basically only good for listening to. Watching this blu ray only makes you dizzy. Shots of each band member last only a second or two, before they move on to another band member or the crowd. The shots are mostly close ups, which is a bit annoying. The sound is excellent, but this video is almost unwatchable.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|good movie with pretty good graphics.Touching story of teen rebellion and growing up. Being brave doesn't always mean facing danger but facing responsibility.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|My attention was captivated the first half of the book, but the second half I found a bit stretched out. Its a very interesting personal story, although there has been much written about NDEs already. I like author's thoughts about the global consciousness, not involving too much the religion. I would recommend this book to a friend.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a fun matching game. Challenging and interesting in 3D. Individual squares are very responsive to my touch - even if I am just tapping the tiniest sliver of the square. The only thing I wish were better was how it lists your results after you match all the squares. I wish it showed your time and compared it to your previous best time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Would rather my granddaughter do something more constructive than play games on my kindle.<br /><br />It is a babysitter.  Probably the last game I will let her download.  Unless I see more value in the game than<br />wasting time.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This app is great and worth paying for to get all the sounds.  And there are so many to choose from.  Love it!
B00B7VZN76|5.0|While I agree that Dr. Crusher was a better Chief Medical Officer then Dr. Pulaski ever was, let's not pretend that her character didn't have some redeeming virtues.  Let's not forget, Dr. Pulaski authored \\"Linear Models of Viral Propagation\\"....  It's still the standard!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|It was good and I like the 1st too but this was better.  Good story, I highly recommend it. Mystery of whodunnit was good too.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is most likely my favorite game for my kids Kindle fires and also my iphone. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because there is no update as of yet for the Kindle. The game itself is incredibly addicting and I'm amazed it's a free game. If you don't have this game, you have to try it!!
B00BMCLCG6|1.0|i like bon jovi, but i don't like the cloud thing so i would just stick to buying the cd
B00006JIA4|5.0|I love Queen and bought this one as my old 2 set CD got scratched! And 5 more words required ....
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I love Jane Austin, but this book really has minimal plot and the characters are one dimensional. Overall, very, very disappointing read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is. a good game that anyone and everyone will love. it does not mater about how old you are
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|I would like to request a refund.  The video quality was very poor.  The movie was difficult to watch.  We ordered the HD version but after watching the first five minutes, we couldn't stand to watch it anymore.  What went wrong?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I heard that the movie based  on this book was going to be coming out and I had wanted to read it before it came out. I don't even know how to start. I felt a whirlwind of emotions. I found myself falling in love with the characters and wanting them to have a happy ending and being terrified that they wouldn't make it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I was looking for a game like this love it...love the graphics the animations .. easy to read.. love the fact that there's a tutorial...
B00028HBKM|5.0|I love The Passion of the Christ. I watch it every Easter and bought it for a friend who has always wanted to own it. It is a powerful and moving depiction of Jesus's last hours. For me it is a movie you must have to watch to make Lent, Holy Week, and Easter come to life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was the best ending I could have asked for it has given me a new perspective on love and what divine yourself
B0060MYM3S|5.0|HBO makes some of the finest shows and a game of thrones is no exception. I guess it helps having George R.R.  Martin as the source material.  The actors do an incredible job.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|My first Charlotte Bronte book. I could not put it down. I am looking forward to reading her other writings.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The most beautifully written and insightful book I've ever read. It's raw and honest and I'm going to read it over and over again, because it parallels real life.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Loved it!!! The way she deals with everything and finds her self was AMAZING. Has to be one of my new fav books. Can't wait for book #3!!!
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Definitely makes you pay attention and you better be quick!  The trains all go in different directions so sharpness is a must.  LOVE IT!
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|This book is excellent for anyone that feels that there has got to be a better, honest, and ethical way to run a business.  You will find it so funny how much stress and pressure we put on ourselves when we really don't have to.  With today's businesses' obsession with money, it is nice to see that there are still people that have a set of principles that they actually follow.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Got this edition of the film because it came in a combo pack with the DVD and a digital copy.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks and plays well, has some great special features.<br />Don't know anything about the DVD yet.<br />Haven't heard any complaints about the dc either.
B000002J03|5.0|They are all great, but this is the absolute best/favorite...I have the vinyl, and thought maybe I had out grown &#34;Zep&#34;.....Not so...Thank you.....PDR
B00BG08FKK|5.0|When I saw that at release they hadn't put out a full cast album and instead had released a &#34;Highlights&#34; CD, I was pretty pissed.<br />However, I waited to see if they would release the real thing, and they did.<br /><br />This is a stellar recording on 2 discs. It is a full cast album with all of the songs from the film, as they are in the film.
B007FH9GA6|3.0|(Changed score from 4 to 3 after watching the foreign original on 2013Mar30.)<br /><br />I started to watch the original foreign version once, but was sidetracked.  And I have never read the books, which may or may not be a good thing; it is often the case that people are biased to like the medium type they read or see first.  But I finally watched the English-language version today.<br /><br />While I usually start with the positives during a review, I will start with the negatives, because I feel that the negatives outweigh the positives, even though ultimately I liked this film.  1.  Very difficult for an American to understand the dialog.  I felt like I still needed subtitles.  2.  The film is a little dark (in light), which adds to the mood, but also makes it difficult to follow some of the action.  3.  The film is too long, in my opinion, at about 2.5 hours.  Was this film actually two books condensed into one film?  It seemed that way to me, as I think that it would have been better to break this movie into two parts, as there was just too much going on.  4.  There are some minor torture scenes here, and I have a hard time watching those types of scenes, I will admit.<br /><br />For the good?  Well, Rooney Mara is really good here, as you probably already know.  She seemed to be perfectly cast.  And Daniel Craig is almost always good; if you want to see him in a surprisingly well-cast role watch \\"Infamous.\\"  And I'm a fan of Stellen Skarsgard as well; I thought that he was perfect in \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and he's very good here.  Heck, he was even good in \\"Mama Mia,\\" a very fun film that I really liked, almost as much as Lea Michelle on \\"Glee.\\"  (That musical was her at-least fictional guilty pleasure on last week's episode.)<br /><br />What's the theme of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\"?  Well, it might be that you-know-what never really changes.  Life goes on, and even if you acquire more money, old relationship issues just seem to keep hanging around.  Atleast that's what I got out of it.<br /><br />I have to admit, these types of films are always tricky to follow, particularly when you don't know anything about the plot going in.  If you miss any scene -- even a part of a scene -- something later may refer back to what you missed and you might be lost.  But I'll give a minor recommendation on this film, despite its weaknesses.
B008CP6RWU|3.0|All three of these games are lovely and great fun to play.<br />However, the PS3 does not like them. They cannot be played straight off the disc; you have to install them first, but even after installing them, you still have to have the disc in the system to play.<br />Great games, but I wish I had bought them from the PS store rather than on disc.
1616550414|5.0|My mom ordered this book for my son and it is one of his favorite things!!  He absolutely loves it!
B008D36INE|1.0|The \\"movie\\" starts with agonizing violins in the soundtrack and a woman commiting suicide by gas inhalation. After about five minutes, I wanted the gas too!!  This is a dredfully boring movie, I am certain. It's like boarding a wooden train in the park and sitting there, waiting for it to steam up and chug down the line. Alas, it never does.
B0051XSKSU|5.0|One of our favorite movies at my house. Action-packed and full of humor. Love Jack Black and his work in this movie, what a great way to bring his sense of humor to child-appropriate levels. And it still keeps mom and dad entertained.
B00BF11STU|1.0|I finally made it through the entire movie. It took about a day because I could not watch more 15-20 minutes without losing interest because of the TOTAL IMPLAUSIBILITY of the story. Why is this not listed under COMEDIES???  It was HILARIOUS!!!  Forget all the build-up to the Magic Moment. Let's just talk about the on-screen action. They deploy two helocraft from Area 51 that are said to \\"not exist\\" and are equipped with rotar-silencing anti-decibel guizmos. They want to sneak across the Pakistani border, and raid the compound in complete silence.<br /><br />So, in the movie, the helocraft SOUND like normal choppers...Oppps....who was in charge of editing that out? Then how to they conduct this SILENT SNEAK ATTACK? First, they crash a helo into the compound. No one hears this and awakens ---except for 20-30 nosy neighbors who come walking up on the ST6 personnel. NEXT, they are BLOWING DOORS off hinges with C4!  Is Usama and Family DEAF or what???  They still do not wake up to see what the devil is going on around the place.<br /><br />Then, the ST6 personnel call out the names of the men folk allegedly living there one by one, using a girlish voice. Each time, the men, who have not arisen to see what crashed or what is exploding ---come out into the hallway like --\\"YES, DEAR What is....\\" and they get shot by U.S. personnel. HILARIOUS!!!!<br /><br />I looked for John Stewart's name as screenwriter but they had someone else. I am pretty sure Stewart and others at Comedy Central had a hand in writing this.<br /><br />The redeeming quality is that they didn't try to make it seem real. That would have been sad. Only the most uninitiated in CIA OPS, law enforcement and military SOP would believe a word of this. And those who still believe Clinton did NOT have sex with that woman.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|the album is great. there are a lot of good stories to listen to. the beats are great and as an overall artist Macklemore is someone to look out for.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|I kept reading because I had to find out how it ended, but it was so depressing all the way through. I don't think I would recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is wonderful, but I cried when Prim died. I also really love how the author ended this book. I love Mockingjay.
030758836X|5.0|Once you figure where the autor is coming from it's much more interesting. Words words words words words words words words. Do I get paid for this?<br /> It's like homework.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was well worth the .99 cents it cost to finish it.  The story line was not great but good it could have gone a little longer but the graphics were pretty good. I will definately recommend this game to others.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|First game I've played of this type and I really enjoyed it!!!  Don't li<br />ke all the picture finds but other than that story line is fun and game is challenging
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this book was amazing although you think its going to be nothing but trash it ended up being very well written.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|I do admit l enjoyed his first books better. This start very slow and it drags on and on but the last 100 pages l enjoyed more. A typical Grisham...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this set was great! I enjoyed the ease of ordering this item on my kindle and look forward to more.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it! The story was great and so were the characters. The characters were great, funny, sweet, strong and with just the right amount of vulnerability. I wish I had a Connor.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved these books, great read! I enjoyed the ease of ordering this item on my kindle and look forward to more.
B008F9E306|2.0|PRODUCTION: 5/8<br />LYRICS: 5/8<br />CONTENT: 4/8<br />ENJOYMENT: 4/8<br /><br />I seriously could not get into this one, it just sounded repetitive and generally boring.  The whole album, from the tracks to the skits, did not seem to fit together and it had poor transitioning.  The production is typical for the South with no real stand out tracks as everything kind of sounded similar.  The beats deliver a repetitive dose of heavy bass and quick hi hats, featuring some of the heavier names in the industry, and somehow just did not come together strong.  T.I.'s performance would be the strongest point, delivering a more than adequate performance with an on point flow but his content and lyrics were a little lacking.  Average album bogged down by fillers, irrelevance, and poor transitioning.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved these books, great read! I enjoyed the ease of ordering this item on my kindle and look forward to more.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Great game, lot of fun and very entertaining!! Like the wizard of oz version of this already great game app!
1476735115|2.0|Wool is entertaining, but does not deserve some of the superlative reviews heaped upon it.<br />It is no better than a mountain of other sci-fi books I have read over the years , and the book is heavily \\"padded\\" ; it could have been edited down to 50 pages without losing anything.
0060578793|5.0|Why i rated a 5    #1. I read it everytime i s***.- This book sits next to my Bathroom Reader books.    #2.. It would be a lifesaver in the wild - assuming u kept it dry    The writing seems a tad too personal form the writers perspective - but as long as the information is correct its all good.
B0039TAHMA|2.0|Not certain of purpose of story-entertainment? Why is a minimum amount of words required for this review? 3 more words.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I thought this game was great.  I have a kindle fire HD and it worked well on it. I like the big fish games also and was unfamiliar with g5 games until this one, but after this, I will buy more.
0307730697|5.0|I wouldn't normally pick up a book like \\"Fearless\\" by Eric Blehm.  I love non-fiction and biographies, but I'm not much for war stories.  Two things motivated me to break my \\"rule\\" and read it: 1) reading \\"Inside Delta Force\\" by Eric L. Haney last year made me curious about their Navy counterpart, SEAL Team Six, and 2) this didn't strike me as a typical war story.  And it's not.<br /><br />This book is the story of a truly extraordinary American life.  It recounts the journey of Adam Brown from idyllic childhood to the depths of drug addiction; finally finding faith in Jesus Christ before rising through the ranks of the Navy to become the best of the best in SEAL Team Six.  Adam's defining characteristics are his courage in the face of any challenge, and his compassion for others.<br /><br />Blehm has really done his homework here; interviewing many of Adam's family, friends, and teammates.  He interweaves their testimonials seamlessly into the narrative of the story.  He keeps things moving at a good clip, and I could feel the tension and pace building as the story moved closer to its inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />Some Christians may be put off by the fairly frequent use of profanity throughout, but I can picture this book being used in a men's bible study to promote discussion on a variety of topics.  The themes are too numerous to mention but they include sacrifice, marital fidelity, fatherhood, addiction, pain, war, pacifism, patriotism, and friendship.<br /><br />This is a powerful, convicting, sad, and triumphant story.  Best of all, Jesus Christ, not Adam Brown, is presented as the ultimate hero.  Or as Adam himself puts it, \\"the greatest man on Earth is Jesus Christ.\\"  May this book of triumph and tragedy remind us of that glorious fact.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|This is probably the best album among all releases. Welcome To My World is my favorite song on the album. I LOVE DEPECHE MODE!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not exactly what I wanted but ok; it was fine. I was captivated and impressed, but I also really wish things had turned out differently.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Very fun game to play a challenging puzzler cant wait to more levels i play it everyday thanks for a good one.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Good solution to needing an alarm. That's all I have to say even though this system wants me to use more words.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I have a 110 inch projection screen and 1080p projector and these look great!  Way better than I expected.  Very impressed.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Though this is not the type of book that I read regularly, I am glad that I did.  The author writes in such a way that my imagination automatically kicks in.  While he was extremely well trained in his area of expertise, he never fails to give honor to those who had helped him with the many missions that had to be dealt with.  In my mind, he comes across as humble, honorable, brave, and honest as he gives praise to others while acknowledging his role in the war.  When he calls &#34;evil&#34; as just evil, it gives a different perspective on the lives that were taken.  The writer also gives a brief history lesson to help to explain what is going on and where.  He also touches on the &#34;legalities&#34; of each kill which I am sure that those of us who do not serve do not think about.  We figure that the good and bad are shooting at one another and that is it.  Not so.  For those who are interested in knowing about different weapons and what they are used for, you will enjoy it.  He also touches on some of the terminology used by the military for a better understanding on what is being said.  There is also the human factor.  Family emotions, guilt over those who were serving with him and were lost.  He always seemed to feel that he had not done enough.  He was also torn between family and country, which I believe many are.  This book will help you to understand that there is more to war than just fighting.  It affects all areas of life in those who serve.  I would reccomend it to everyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great little calculator easy to see and to use. Does basic things as well as slightly more difficult must have for kindle fire.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is my fav. I just love looking at all the different things on here. whenever i'm looking for something different, unique or just some ordinary thing. I go to pinterest. I love it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is simply wonderful. Interesting storyline, good puzzles. Just great all around. &amp; that's jus the demo part. Can't wait to unlock the rest of the game...
B003V1WTMM|3.0|Did not enjoy this as much as other novels by her. It dragged at times, repeated threads of the book over and over. I found myself losing interest at times. Still her discriptions of scenes were well done and her characters came to life at times. She is a good writer and I will continue to read her.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|I am a qualified medical person with 20 years of looking for effective natural cures for disease, and this book is a great one, a must read. there are other alternatives out there but i found this one to be in line with science of wellness at highest level<br />I am amazed how  disease management wasteful and fraudulent  main stream  symptom oriented industry has successfully has burried this book  with the help of  commercial media , so well that i never heard of it until i saw it on you tube.<br />I recommend that to cancer patients , preventive  orientated people . i dontt think any one  living in a modern polluted world would not need this book
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved it. Captured me from the first page and held me to the last. One of her best and I am going to pick this as a read for my Book Club.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the first sentence you are imported into district 12. Each line draws you closer to the main character Katniss living her struggles, sharing her fears, and feeling her hunger. I loved every minute of it and couldn't stop reading until the final page.
B004H8ZQKU|5.0|Wonderful example of what could happen in our future.  Where is the ethics about this process?  Critical thinking is hopefully done after watching this movie.<br />D.C.
0374533571|5.0|In a book club this was the choice. I was pleasantly surprised how this book grabs you from page one. If you suffer from what this book is about or know someone that does, it's very true to life.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use this app a few times a week. Worth it. I use it to fall alseep. Love the water sounds- ocean waves and many different raining ones. Pros... many sounds to choose from, able to control pitch, sleep timer, alarm clock. Cons... don't have any complaints. Get this and enjoy.
B0074V3712|4.0|I finished reading Edward O. Wilson's The Social Conquest of Earth, and decided that it belongs as one of the bookends for four of the other great books in my library.  (The other books being Steven Pinker's Blank Slate, Richard Dawkins' two books, The Greatest Show on Earth and The Ancestor's Tale and a much older book by Norbert Weiner, The Human Use of Human Beings).  The other bookend, of course, is Wilson's Consilience.<br /><br />Wilson makes some excellent points about both physical and social evolution, basing much of his evaluation of human societies on his life-long work with ant colonies.  He sometimes takes exception to the work of Dawkins and other biologists, but generally he presents a very special, often personal look at human society.<br /><br />Although I absorbed much of what he proposed, there were sections of the book (the reader was warned) that I found difficult to understand by a layman in the field.  His most telling opinion is at the end of the book, wherein he proposes many changes to peoples' use of Earth's resources; changes which would go much beyond avoidance of global warming.<br /><br />The book is written much like a series of essays; perhaps a gleaning of his years of experience in the societal makeup of ant, termite and similar colonies.<br /><br />The shortcoming of the book is Wilson's illustrations and photos.  I don't think any of them clarify or truly illustrate any point in his book.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is hecka fun I'm addicted to it ive had it for two days so far and I love it I play it every night
B00B2166BS|4.0|After testing with the tablet on under identical operating conditions, it took 6.7 hours to charge the tablet with the USB cable but only 5.7 hours with the pogo cable.  It only fits one way, which is not a problem because the convex side goes up so you can align it even in the dark.  The magnetic catch is safer than the USB cable and leaves the port free for hosting.  Because the tablet can be rotated in any direction, you can have the cable coming out on whichever side you like.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a really good game for horse lovers and can be played by both children and adults and it is really child friendly. If I could rate this game 1 out of 5 I would give it 5 stars
B007JZGIMS|2.0|I hope this app gets the bugs out. it sounds great and handles albums well. HOWEVER it plays then just stops! It also has to search your music everytime it starts. Annoying! It might be competing with the stock music player that has NO EQUALIZER! Shame on you Amazon! Since you are locked into using only apps from Amazon, you can't get Power Amp or the like for your Kindle Hd. Shame AGAIN on you Amazon! Anyway, I hope the programmers for this app get it right. Especially after I paid for it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much amazing it is the best aircraft game ever it is so addicting I wish it had a better one line mode
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I would definitely recommend this app to all horse lovers. Sometimes it is a little bit slow otherwise it is lots of fun!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book the best one out of the serious can't wait for the next one one it is probably gonna be better than this one
B009B08LJ2|5.0|We love this series. We streamed it using our Roku xs and the quality was great. Just wanted to watch the first installment again and now we own it for whenever we want. :)
B008B92U32|5.0|This app is awesome and hilarious as long as you take the time to do it right. The interface is a bit confusing at first though.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|I enjoy playing the game with my girls ages four and ten very easy to play and use. great game for all ages! great free game for the whole family
B007TNS6JI|4.0|The control takes some getting used to but it is a good timewaster.<br />Besides, can you honestly say you wouldn't want to take an axe to a guy's head sometimes?<br />No, this one will do nicely.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a book that is hard to put down...you have to see where you are being led next and who will finally come out the victor.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it a great game good for all ages and anyone who loves horses. I wish there was more choices for types of compotitions and horse selection.
030758836X|1.0|I figured out the big \\"twist\\" about 20 pages into the book, the characters are unlikable and the story is dull.  If I could give this zero stars I would.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. I have a kindle fire HD and had no issues with the download or with the game itself. Graphics were great &amp; I'm looking forward to the sequel. Luckily I only paid a buck so it was well worth the price!
B000JMKNV0|4.0|Having watched the movie kind of ruined the twist for me, but nonetheless I couldn't' t put this book down.  One of Lehane's best.
0486211045|5.0|A perfect tool for understanding anatomy and how the different body parts move relative to each other. The different sections of the body are divided into smaller- more manageable segments- which makes it easier for the reader to digest.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|This is a cool game that really test your puzzle mind. I also like the crashes. It isharder than most puzzle games I have played.
1560100842|5.0|Learning from one of the masters of the golden era of animation was a real joy. I recommend this book to anyone seeking to learn more about the work that goes into animating a cartoon.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|My wife was kind enough to allow us to watch this one(not for kids). I liked it for the cool over the top fighting sequences, but she was just being nice. Not much of a story to speak of, so don't expect much. Almost a spoof, but not quite.
0823023494|5.0|This book covers character creation, story boarding and even script writing. The best part is that it asks successful animators and cartoonist to make characters based on a script written by the author, who is also a successful cartoonist.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Great case right up to the point where it fell off the roof of a car...then then got run over by another vehicle.  After finding the case/phone in the middle of the road, the phone/case was accidently dropped into water. Yes this really happened within a few days and the case still did it's job. phone is still working but had to purchase a new protective case.  This was a good case but beware of the cheap knock-offs out there.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|After his release of his 1st cd and his 2nd cd (which is a classic, by the way) I couldn't wait to buy Justin's 3rd. Boy am I disspointed. It's not good - at all. While this cd followed the format of FutureSex/ LoveSounds - with the maxisingle extended track style of old, I couldn't wait for some of the songs on the 20/20 Experience to end. The songs are just not good. There are only about two tracks worth listening to: \\"Pusher Love Girl\\" & \\"Tunnel Vision\\". The lead single \\"Suit & Tie\\" is horrible. The production is bad, the lyrics are weak, and the whole flow just doesn't make sense. Jay-Z is my favorite rapper, but he wasn't good on this track - at all. I believe the only thing pushing this single are the super power names attached to this song. The second release, Mirrors, is as corny as it gets. I can't relate to this done before kind of song at all. I can't believe that this cd is as bad as it is. I hope Timberlake works on a good follow up soon.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Our daughter loves Lego Friends. She first saw them at a friends house and was instantly obsessed with them. She was a little young at the time at 5 years old, but we decided to purchase this set for her for Christmas and it was a big hit. She did really well with it because of the simple to follow instructions.  Since then, we have continued to purchase sets to add to her collection.<br /><br />The LEGO Friends Olivia's Tree House Set comes with 191 pieces. It includes the Olivia character. It is a really cool tree house with lots of neat looking leaves and a strong structure.  Once it is put together, it is surprisingly sturdy.  Included in the set are two animals (a cat and a bird) and several accessories such as a fish and bowl for the cat to eat, lots of flowers, butterflies and ladybugs to put all over, a telescope, and a bird house.  It is a really nice set with a lot of pieces to let your child's imagination run wild. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow for a child. The recommended age is 6-12, but a 5 year old will only need minimal help with it.<br /><br />One point of caution. I have found that the average per piece price of the LEGO Friends sets are around 10 cents per piece. That is the going rate from WalMart/Target or when Amazon is the seller. Some secondary Amazon retailers sell the Friends sets for much more. We purchased this set from Amazon for just under $20. Make sure to shop around if the current price is higher than that on Amazon.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a great first set for your child to get her interested in LEGO Friends or a great addition to your LEGO Friends collection. Highly Recommended!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Ang Lee's \\"Life of Pi\\" is a masterpiece of state-of-the-art film making, a beautiful creation that tells a moving story in heart-touching way.<br /><br />Starting from the very opening credits, it is a gorgeous film to watch.  Filmed in vibrant color and mostly natural settings, with animals featured in many scenes, it is more visually stunning than any nature documentary I've ever seen.  The scenes at sea, both at night under the stars and during the day, under a wide variety of different ocean conditions, show the true beauty and terrifying power of the open ocean.  Certainly some of the scenes, especially the phosphoresence scenes, are computer enhanced, but the net effect is spectacular.<br /><br />The animals, especially the Bengal tiger, are the costars of the movie, and their actions are incredibly lifelike and true to their animal nature.  This is no Disney film - in only one short scene does the tiger exhibit any humanlike traits.  I have no idea how Ang Lee actually created and captured these animal scenes on film - the special effects are so good, with no hints of fakery, that you will believe that all the scenes really were filmed at sea with the lead actor on a small boat alongside a hungry, vicious tiger.  This is present-day special effects at its absolute best, and in service to a movie that is not a science fiction shoot-em-up.  Impressive.<br /><br />The movie's story is about stories: how they are created and retold, and the impact they have on people.  \\"Life of Pi\\" has some interesting things to say about religion, because the documents at the heart of all major religions are effectively books of stories, very little of which can actually be proven or verified to have happened.  Pi's story about what happened at sea on his boat where he was the only human survivor is no different, and when you can't scientifically verify something, the question becomes what do you believe?  \\"Life of Pi\\" leaves it to the viewer to decide.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is quite an achievement for director Ang Lee.  I think I know why Hollywood voted the \\"Hollywood saves the day\\" film Argo as the Oscar's Best Picture of 2012, but \\"Life of Pi\\" is a far better and much more memorable movie.
0399231919|1.0|I was shocked when I got a book that looked used when it said new!!  They are nice enough to replace it for me.
B000ENC5YW|5.0|My husband and I watched it when it arrived since he had never seen before.  Way worth buying here than at the store for price.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Amazingly written and very emotional. I am actually stunned right now. I recommend this book and I'm definitely going to check out the authors other works.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a fun and very addicting game. the only reasons I won't  give it 5 stars is that there are an annoying amount ads now.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another crossfire book that I couldn't put down. Love the characters and I can't wait for the third book to be released.
B007T7MIR0|5.0|This is a great reader for Word Documents if you don't want to edit them. Several ways to look at them -- in page format or in Web format which allows you to enlarge the print for reading on phone or tablet! Love it.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I've noticed that Dan Brown seems to have the same pattern of writing for all his books but it never becomes redundant. And what I like the most is after reading any book by him I come away not only with pleasure but also a wealth of knowledge I'd never would have discovered. Thank you for challenging my mind!
B009UZBLSG|4.0|Worked great for mirroring the display of the Nexus 4 onto my HDMI display.  I tested with a 1920x1080 display and my testing included 'protected' content such as Netflix.  I encountered no issues (e.g. lag or flicker) with the display.<br /><br />I found it to be easy to connect, it feels well built, and the packaging was reasonable.<br /><br />Issues:<br /><br />- the micro-USB 'pass-through' allows you to charge the phone while using this dongle, but other USB functionality does not work.  So you couldn't connect a USB mouse and keyboard or a USB audio device.  This is a rather esoteric consideration at this time (and would require a USB-OTG adapter) but could become more important within the life of this purchase.<br /><br />- the Nexus 4 (with 4.2.2) has no 'settings' for the external display.  My immediate issue is that I want to turn off the phone's screen while using the external display, and was expecting to find something under 'display' in settings.  I've read that there is an app that will turn the screen off but allow it to continue to respond to touch, but it requires root.<br />(This issue is specific to Android, but I think that's what people are buying this for.)
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|This is the worse hip hop album I have ever heard, and the worse Wayne album by far. I didn't think it could get worse than I Am Not a Human Being Part 1 and Carter V, but it has. Please stay away so he can stop rapping and leave hip hop for good.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I've listened to this album numerous times and highly enjoy Barbra singing with others.  My favorite is when she sings with herself on &#34;one less bell to answer/a home is not a home&#34;.  Really recommend to anyone who loves Babs.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Love having the Weather Channel at my finger tips any time, any place.  Really enjoy having this application available on my Kindle or phone.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|Just downloaded this app to my android phone(HTC V One). Every time I try to sign in I get as far as the legal waivers and can't go any further. I can't find any information on the Help section so I would appreciate any input.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I was just minutes away from ordering a $300.00 Pathfinder by Blind Hours when I saw a review  by E2E on YouTube about the BK2. I ordered the BK2 from Amazon ( cheapest I could find, $65.00) and it got here in 3 days. WOW! what a knife. I have chopped, carved a spoon and fork, shaved feather sticks and Last night I killed and quartered a chicken with it and it did as good as my butcher knife from Outdoor Edge. This is as close to a one tool option as you can get. you will burn more energy than if you had a saw but I took down a 4 inch oak sapling with it in no time. very sharp right out of the box. I finished it with a glass rod and ran it across a razor strop and it is shaving sharp. It held that edge all day even after chopping down that tree. Hate the Sheath! O ordered a leather one with fire steel from eBay for $60.00. This knife is all I wanted it to be and more. It saved me over 250 bucks. This is a sharpened crow bar that will last for ever. I will clean and butcher a deer with it this hunting season and I have no worries that it will preform wonderfully. I have a lot of knives but this is fast becoming my favorite.<br /><br />4/7/2013 Just back from 4 days in the woods. Knife worked hard and kept the edge. again, best knife I own hands down!<br /><br />Go to ebay . com and get a sheath from this guy. I bought one and just got back from 4 days in the woods. I love this sheath as much as the knife. good price and will hold up to all the work I will do with it. Type in this item and see what he has.Item number: 150859188178
B005723JSQ|4.0|Have read a few other Sophie Kinsella books and enjoyed them but had no expectations about this one. Loved it......unexpected twists and how they were Han d led that made it so good. Highly recommend!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|This was great to see before the movie! So good to see Colm Wilkinson with the 4 Valjean's at the end! Awesome!
B005VMSATA|3.0|The movie was ok, not much to say action was not the greatest!!!<br />Overall ok!! I love the actor lol...
B00110K62U|4.0|I wish this were on BluRay....but great to see it on DVD, I had the original VHS. &#60;sigh&#62;. Great performances....the definitive cast for sure!
1575666286|5.0|challenging, but educational.  challenging because it requires a diet change that will eliminate the convenience foods of today.  good read.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Great movie much more than I expected . I found the CGI to be top notch. Hope they can do a part 2 some how
B006LSZECO|3.0|It took me awhile to get into this book but by the time I did I just couldn't put it down. (I bought the audio in addition to the book and really liked hearing the voices of the characters.)  Towards the end I kept wondering how the author would wrap it up - ie. Would they kill each other, leave each other, would Amy go to jail (I didn't think Nick would).  But it fell flat as it didn't end at all.  I kept looking for the next chapter.  Don't know why the author decided to end this way.  -- as far as the foul language, is that how the younger generation talks now?
B0058W74UY|1.0|if you are looking to this to help you with Flash for your kindle Fire HD which does not play flash, do NOT waste your time. This will not help you one bit.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I'm really enjoying watching  the series.  I like the main character, and find the drama interesting and thought provoking. Hard to stop watching them once I get started.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|You'll have to filter out much unessential verbiage but the essential story itself stands the test of time.  If you are interested in French history, you'll find less to skip, but I'm not, so just scanned those parts.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|From the dark strains of the opening song, it is clear that Depeche Mode has rolled with the times. If Future Sound of London ever put words to their music, this is what it would sound like. They maintain such perfect harmony and allow a dark and brooding sound to flow without sounding like a bunch of whiny emo-kids. David Gahan has what so many wish for...the ability to be beautifully dark. Do yourself a favor...if you loved them \\"back in the day\\" then pick this album up and let them show you the still have it.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Wordy and repetitive, but a kind of fun plot.  Desperate for better spelling and grammar.  For example, uses &#34;site&#34; for &#34;sight&#34; repeatedly.
B008RTE09S|5.0|Awesome DVD for the true Beatle collector. Rarely seen in the theaters. Great , great songs - timeless. Just a fun Beatle experience. Blu-ray pulls out great color quality and the sound of the Beatles songs re-mastered are fantastic. As a Beatle fan all I can say is buy it, you'll love it in Blu-ray or on regular DVD. Again Awesome - really, really awesome!!

B007BFSYMS|5.0|I enjoy the many noise tracks (the Amazon is my favorite).  Periodically, I experience buzzing noises in my ear.  The white noise has helped a lot.  I pop my ear phones into my cell phone and find myself having a restful night's sleep!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was a good book, but the story didn't end very well. I think Greg should learn a lesson, and have a better life.
B009FB3WQ4|5.0|Wish she'd have sung more, but one never gets enough of Barbra...and they should because she never dissapoints. I listen over and over to her even at this age she is the TOP
B003KUSUG8|1.0|I have no idea why so many people like this album. The production is horrid and uninspired. Em can't sing and should never try to do it. The man's rapping even sucks on this \\"effort\\". He does a freakin duet with Pink now?? Whats next??? Just a poor excuse for an album by a guy that wrote brilliant material in the past (Slim Shady LP, Marshall Mathers LP)<br />Em tried to take himself very seriously on this record. This whole album sounds like a second rate, generic radio offering. In a word, BORING.
B00766CLPI|5.0|Had it the first time they produced it, bought it again in CD format, now this update with even more. She has not dissapointed me ever.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It tugs at your heartstrings, makes you laugh out loud, and think deeply. One of the best books I have read.

B008C20TDG|5.0|I love this book, it's easy to read and I found it an extremely helpful tool for my whole 30 journey.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|Nice unit amps the sound up to a good level. You can always plug another type of headphone in the units output jack in case something ever happens to them. A great deal at the price.
B002PNAY9C|5.0|Very good, my soon lo it so much. I recommend for n body who like a good book and also believe in dragons.
0307595579|5.0|Terrific edition of a quality trilogy.  Can't say enough about the printing and binding; not to mention the extra volume dedicated to Larsson's writings.  Perfect addition to any mystery fan's collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Woah! Im gonna get a real horse sometime and before i do i wanted an idea of what it would be like. This game is amazing.and its free! I highly suggest this game
B001NHNG64|4.0|Enjoyed the incorporation of neo-con, domestic rebels as Reacher's nemesis in this one and the lengthy build-up made the final sequencers all the more exciting.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is awesome just sometimes skips a little other than that its good. This is my review.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I know I will get a lot of negatives here but I just had to say that I CANNOT stand this book. It is all over the place, this place now that place then...<br />It is just not my style of book where the set up is in Chicago for one chapter and then in Hamburg for the next chapter. I understand that it is nice to see what is happening all over the place/world but for me, it was just not what I like.<br />I wish I could like it.<br />My coworkers almost all LOVE this book so if you are not sure about it definitely give it a read and make up your own opinion please and I really hope you will enjoy it !
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Definitely could have been better, but I liked the last quarter of it. Suspense, passion, and just plain craziness. Not too bad
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This is such a cute movie. Spooky but not really and of course a little love story as well, who would want a movie without it, right? So many funny little things in this movie that keep you giggling pretty much the entire movie with your kiddos.<br />So if you are not sure just rent it, but i am sure you will love it just like I did.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have no idea how I actually came across this book - but it's not often that I find a book that I sync between my phone and my Kindle so that I can read it anywhere.  I'm a huge new fan of this author.
1476734941|2.0|Well I was hoping on a more HOW TO 'guide' with more recipes/day plans and such but in fact it is more of a story told from his and her perspective. Most of is that want to lose weight I am assuming to be about 20 pounds or so overweight and we would like to hear from people that have similar issues how they went along doing this and if it was a success and if it was a big struggle and what the struggles were. Recipes are in this book, BUT not more than a handful of pages, you also get some info of course on the how and why... but really hearing someone in this book saying that they weren't really overweight to begin with but for them it worked to lose the 10 extra pounds, to me that just is a oxymoron... I mean are you or are you not overweight? How can you have 10 extra pounds if you are in fact not overweight? If you are like me and hoping for a guide with recipes and stories from people with weight issues then this book is not for you (at least in my opinion). It does give you some information but the information I want to know more about then again is not elaborated on, and this is a shame really. I would not buy this book again.<br />If you are a person that wants to know an overview (sort of) and if you are not a person that has any weight issues but need to drop the extra ten pounds (here is the oxymoron again!) then maybe you can give it a try.<br />Oh and it has a calorie char in there as well, but really I would have been better off buying a calorie counter book and start counting out 500-600 calories a day for the -fasting days- all that info I am able to find online for free and then some...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good kids game for girls or boys eho love horses but cant have there own. great for practice. our girls love it
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I LOVE IT and cannot wait for season two to be released !!!!!!<br />It will keep you guessing and just when you think you figured it out they will make you guess again and again and again!<br />The acting is great and the camera views and moves are also very much important to get the right feel for a show/movie... This show delivers on all levels!!! If you are not hooked after episode 1 or 2 I would be very surprised! Go and watch this show now!!!
B003204MQS|4.0|I wouldn't classify as this a movie but since it was actually footage it was worth watching. In the beginning it was slow but then once the activity started, it was interesting. Once the girl started getting really weird it shows how demonic forces can affect a person. It sure was scary how she screamed \\"Micha\\" and then she threw him across the room.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Love this movie.  This purchase was a replacement of a copy that my daughter watched so much that it wore out.  This dvd arrived timely and works perfectly.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is very realistic and the graphics are good. it keeps the player busy with more things to do like cleaning grooming and training!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This movie was fantastic I never left this movie until it was over. I learned a lot from this movie, I never realized that Argo was a staged fake Si Fi movie used to rescue the hostages.

0142403873|5.0|Love this book.  It's got a great rhyming cadence for reading aloud.  I really like that the mouse figures out how to make everyone afraid of him by being so clever ;-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When they were about to eat the berries I was like oh my! How will the other two go! Then when peeta was told she was lying just makes me want to read the next one! Great job hope the second and third are just as good with drama action and a blurry love story
1609611543|5.0|I never had a problem with my weight until 1994, which coincides with the introduction of GMO's! For years, I tried everything to lose weight, exercise didn't do it, eating what I thought were healthy foods didn't help at all. I gained 40 pounds over several years, finally, I felt hopeless. My asthma was awful, and I realized it was worse after eating certain foods, foods that never bothered me before. The first positive change came when a friend brought over some vegetable seedlings for me and I planted Kale,Swiss Chard, and Arugula, and some herbs. I started to feel better and felt there might be hope. I was still eating whole wheat, though. When I heard about Dr. Davis's book, I had a huge Ah ha! moment. Now I knew it wasn't all my fault, and I completely cut out all wheat products- pasta, crackers, bread etc. So far,I have lost 23 pounds! My asthma is pretty much gone, my blood pressure is normal and my cholesterol numbers are better each time I'm checked, with no meds. I am 63 years old and feel like a kid.<br />This book is terrific,everyone should read it and alleviate their suffering.The doctors didn't do anything but prescribe pills and tell me to eat low fat foods.Wrong! Just cut out wheat, and the change is amazing. Once you realize how you've been manipulated by the food industry, you will want to go organic. You feel like a new person. It really is upsetting to me that \\"the staff of life\\" has been so adulterated. We have a right to eat foods that don't make us sick, especially when we are told we should eat lots of wheat and bread products. Take Aunt Vera's suggestion, and grow some of your own veggies, if you can. It's not hard, and that and cutting out ALL wheat, will change your life!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I first played this game on my mother-in-law's kindle and I thought it was an okay game. Now that I own a kindle I figured I would download it.. I'm learning more about the game the more I play.

B00AYR2FOI|5.0|From his start with the Steve Miller Band way back in the 1960s Boz Scaggs has pretty much played and recorded music in seemingly every genre you can imagine: blues, pop, rock, disco, jazz, pop standards, and more.  If you're a longtime fan like me you're used to his divergences into different musical genres and have enjoyed them over his lengthy career.  Like a fine wine, Boz's voice has mellowed and intensified with age, and his forays into jazz with [[ASIN:B000UTI7H4 But Beautiful , Jazz Standards: Volume 1]] and [[ASIN:B001J10RLG Speak Low]] absolutely dazzled me as his voice is perfect in that genre as is his inimitable phrasing.  And honestly it's that intensity, sincerity, and dedication that Boz brings to any foray.  I've loved most of what he's done and was first hooked on [[ASIN:B000HEZF90 Silk Degrees]] as so many folks were.  His ability to seamlessly segue from one musical genre to another has been astonishing, and with \\"Memphis\\" Boz returns to his roots way back in the day.  I've loved his original compositions, but equally love his covers and remakes and here what he's doing is remaking and tweaking the originals to suit his voice and the results are completely magical!  Many of these songs will be familiar...maybe not immediately, but in time they will.  \\"Memphis\\" isn't as straightforward bluesy as his earlier solo material or his work with the Steve Miller Band; it veers more into the realm of smooth jazz with a blues edge to it.  There's honestly nothing rowdy or raucous here, but that's OK.  As Boz has proved with many recent releases less is sometimes more and his phrasing often reminds me of Shirley Horn, with wonderful pauses for dramatic effect and putting his voice more front and center.  After so many decades Boz knows how to work a song to the right effect and does so masterfully here.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|This is a great alternative to Google Reader! The only thing I don't like is that it cant find every link.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|From the music, to the graphics, to the game design, to the logic puzzles this is the very best of its class. If you feel down just play the music to feel better. Rather than just a bunch of hidden object games, you are carried along in a theme dialogue. The interspersed logic games were fun but can be skipped if need be. They might be different but a new game won't be better than this game. The best hidden object game ever.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent series.  Very well done.  Loved the twists and turns and the authenticity of costumes.  Loved the character portrayals, especially the Dowager!
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Another fun ride in the Marvel-sphere.  One now begins to see the set up to the eventual Avengers movie.  Again, Downey gets the emotional character of Tony Stark right.  A person who has had a life of getting everything he wants, who suddenly has to deal with not being able to get all that he wants.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It is a game that helps my kids understand life of adventure so they will go on trips when they get older so I would recommend this game to you people.
B001KZG99A|4.0|Downey certainly brings the right touch to a hero with flaws.  Not a serious character study, but more than one normally expects from a summer blockbuster.  Downey gets it right.
B004Y1WCDE|1.0|i had a LOT  better luck using a Subsonic server with Subsonic clients - Subsonic is FAST, flexible, awesome.  Plex is SUPER SLOW.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it. I can't wait to read the last book. When my son is old enough, he will enjoy.
B00000JXVK|5.0|should have bought it/seen it in 1970's, but never too late. must have for riders old and new.  good price
B009VYF5E2|5.0|In Season 4 of a projected 5-Season story-arc much of what we have heard about the legend of Arthur is touched upon. (It has already been announced that the show ends with Season 5.) Uther dies, Arthur is crowned king, Lancelot has a tryst with Gweneviere betraying Arthur, Arthur marrys her anyway, and the season ends with the Sword in the Stone. It is one thing to know that TV and Movies are rarely shot in sequence but it is quite another to know that Camelot is located in a backlot at Cardiff Studios in Wales and Arthur's Castle is located in Brittany, France where scenes for an entire Season of programs is shot in one session lasting weeks. As often happens as the popularity of a show increases so does its budget and the complexity of the CGI effects used to create it. The backbone of the program remains the by-play between Merlin and Arthur both now in their mid-twenties. The fact that they are made peers allows us to see them grow and mature together in their relationship with one another and in their mastery of the duties allotted them. The show retains the light-hearted banter that has characterized it from the beginning and touches on the more serious aspects of the story without getting heavy. It remains a family oriented program.
B001Q5397O|4.0|If you want to sit back and laugh. This is the movie for you. The clowns like to clown around,<br />but watch out. You could just loose your head or be turned into cotton candy.
B003Z0BSU8|5.0|Have been picking up everything this man records from the day he first burst on the scene. Have seen him perform in person and am enchanted with his unembellished workmanlike style. He is just as at home accompanying a vocal soloist or conducting a chamber music group from the keyboard.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Season 1 is amazing. It gets you sucked into the series.<br />I, personally, didn't LOVE the show until the 6th episode - although I enjoyed it from the start. That's when the show started really digging into the characters in a meaningful way.<br />Also, when I first watched the pilot, I felt that Anna Torv was a little... stony? wooden? I HAD NO IDEA HOW WRONG I WAS! After having watched the entire series, the transformations and growth and subtlety that Torv put into this character from the start makes it impossible to believe that she has never even been nominated for an Emmy.<br />If you have a love of crime dramas, this show is for you from the start and you shouldn't really need much selling on it.<br />If, like me, you are a bit tired of crime dramas and prefer a more serialized story, THIS SHOW IS FOR YOU! It has everything.<br />To quote the show's showrunner, JH Wyman, this isn't a show just about the cases or the agency or even about just a love of science fiction or FBI shows (although all of that stuff is in there). Ultimately, though, this show is about love, in ways expected and unexpected. And you can see it from the beginning. This is a show about &#34;a love strong enough to break the world, and strong enough to heal it.&#34;
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|THIS is the kind of crossover hit that all &#34;teen lit&#34; should be. Yes, technically this is a young adult novel, but it is so much more than that. The book is a million times more graphic than the movies, but it's amazing. That said, you've been warned. What I don't get is why it's OK for teens to read intricate descriptions of these things, but showing them on screen would make it R-rated. Whatever.<br /><br />I am a little skeptical of anything with first person narration, but for anyone who would consider NOT reading these books because of that, let me tell you - BOOKS LIKE THIS ARE WHY FIRST PERSON NEEDS TO EXIST. There is soooooo much that is gained from a first person perspective. I mean, listen, you may call this a SPOILER SO STOP READING NOW IF YOU ARE SUPER DUPER SENSITIVE, BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS ONE: with a three book series written in the first person it should be pretty clear that Katniss survives the hunger games. As she is the one explaining what happens. So, when I realized that, I thought &#34;What's even the point!? I know how it ends!&#34; I WAS SO WRONG! The character of Katniss is so compelling and rich and layered. Katniss is a character that the movies, although wonderful, can never accurately portray no matter how hard they try. This is because an integral feature of Katniss' character, as you will find when you read, is that she is nearly incapable of communicating the things that she feels. The way she and her words and actions are perceived rarely, if ever, matches what she feels or thinks inside. That internal struggle and desire to be understood or left alone is amazing to read, and very unique. Also, the book is kept very tactile. In the arena, I liked not having an omniscient perspective. I liked that there weren't descriptions of how Katniss looked or changed throughout the games. Its all about how to survive. It's not romanticized. And it makes it all feel very tangible.<br /><br />This is the kind of strong female role model that young girls should have - someone who takes the time to learn to find out who she is and who sorts out her priorities before thinking about romance. I dislike teen romance books about these girls who see an attractive guy and suddenly he's her whole life. That's not what these books are about. If anything, these books deal more accurately with romance than anything I've ever read - teen or otherwise. Romance in these novels isn't about love at first sight or even investing all of your time and energy into that one special person who will save you from your previously boring and/or terrible existence. Rather, these books really capture the idea that it's not always clear how you feel - not in the quirky romcom way of, &#34;Oh no! Who do I really love? How will I ever decide!? Woe is me.&#34; This is a girl who asks more important questions of her life, questions that people I actually know actually ask. Questions like, &#34;Do I even have time for romance right now?&#34; &#34;Just because these guys are interested, does that mean I have to choose any of them?&#34;<br /><br />Despite the marketing of the movies, this is not about a love triangle. The romantic situations in here are all secondary to this girl's desire to be free, to save her family, to get what she feels inside herself to come across accurately to the people around her.<br />This is about a girl who struggles with a society and a world who tells her how to look, how to act, how to be, and knowing that listening can save her life, but also being deeply resentful of an inability to just be herself.<br />The situations that these kids are in are terrible. They're supposed to be. They're supposed to make you feel big emotions and think about how to make the world in which we all live into a better place.<br /><br />It succeeds on all counts.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|It was heartwarming and very emotional. My daughter loved it thanks to Percy Jackson she is brave and smart about her choices.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|Another great Harry Bosch story by Michael Connelly.  Perhaps I'm becoming accustomed to Connelly's style, but I didn't find the plot twists as creative as in past writings.  Nevertheless, I found myself skipping over words as I raced to the conclusion.  A very good read.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|make the time longer<br /><br />how much is the paid version. I play it night and day.  now I know why everyone loves it
B00AFEXRME|5.0|People who have no first-hand experience with alcoholism may find this movie a little over-the-top.  (No pun intended.)  However, it is the most realistic depiction of alcoholism in the cinema I have ever seen, and that includes such films as \\"The Lost Weekend\\", \\"Days of Wine and Roses\\" and \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\".  Every aspect of this movie is first-rate and reveals the insanity of alcoholic behavior exactly as it is.  Those who are not in recovery or who don't know anyone who is will probably neither understand nor appreciate the progressive, self-destructive and ultimately fatal nature of this disease.  But the fact is, everything in this film rings all-too-true.  Kudos to the entire cast and crew for an all-around brilliant job!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Cool.  Gotta get the bucks though.....<br /><br />It takes a while to earn them. Bog fed ped real fish eat slug
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is bad.<br /><br />The writing is horrible. She uses so many repetitive turns of phrase that I made a game of tracking them on my kindle.<br /><br />The language...What year is this set in? Where are they again?<br /><br />Having orgasms on the first time? Good for you, girl.<br /><br />Did I finish? No. But I'm sure glad she did over and over and over and over again.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book is easy to read. It is entertaining. Nice story line . Easy to follow. A great book to read.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Since Adele has decided to fall in love and have a life, this will have to do until she heads out on tour again in like 20 years.<br /><br />It's so wonderful. I feel like I'm right there at Royal Albert Hall, in the audience singing the songs that are written on my heart.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|oh my gosh ----  cannot stop watching this show!!!  and I am not alone in this addiction!  anyone who starts cannot stop!
0143118420|5.0|I read this book during a particularly difficult break-up and found that it it healed me with each turn of the page.<br /><br />I particularly love when she learned to love again. Rather, she learned to give herself permission to forgive herself. Which is probably the most difficult lesson of all.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I learned that the most important closure isn't the closure that someone else gives you, but it's the closure that you give yourself.<br /><br />LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|it's okay.  glad I saw it...but not one of my favorites.  wish you didn't have to put so many words in here
0802473156|5.0|Everyone loves differently. Reading this book helped me to spot the ways in which different people show love and feel loved.<br /><br />It has been key in healing and understanding my relationships. I really don't have to ask myself if a person loves me anymore.<br /><br />Understanding someone's love language really helps to avoid arguments and clearly communicate needs. In theory...
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Was looking for Fringe on netflix or hulu.  Waited for what seamed for ever and never got it so bought Prime.  Haven't watch anything other than since love this show. Going to hate when i run out of episodes.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Ignorance really isn't bliss, especially when it comes to your health and the environment.<br /><br />This film changed the way I looked at eating forever. From the mistreatment of animals and farmers to the china study things won't change unless we be come conscious about how we consume.<br /><br />There are tons of documentaries about our food system and I've seen many, but if you're going to watch one, this is it. It's a great overview of our food system and how we are suffering from it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, watch it. You will never see our world the same.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love it so much. The game is so cool you get unit like nabey over 100 Dinosaurs! you shops play it.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|I LOVE the Grinch. Always have, always will.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is ridiculously funny. He keeps me laughing through the holiday. Sure there's a lovely moral to the story, but honestly, it's Jim and his amazing physical comedy that keeps me coming back.
B0024FA18K|3.0|Most of us are curious about exactly what Adolf Hitler's thought processes were. This book, an unfortunate classic, will very on illuminate his hubris, as well as the origins of his racism. But reading the whole book? It isn't necessary. Reading the first few chapters will be more than enough for anyone to see inside this man's mind, and how insidiously the Nazi party grew. This book shows just how easily prejudice against practically anyone non-Germanic grew in Europe. But if you're looking for great literature, you won't find it.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|Nice demos and mixture of exercises.  I bought the full version so I could landscape it on my tablet.  I just wish there was a little more time between exercises in order to get equipment needed.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This was the last album George Harrison recorded, I believe, before he died of cancer. It is light-hearted, fun, clever and full of just great music! Honestly, it's infectious. Once you start listening to it, you can't stop!
B004V5QWU2|1.0|It really sucks when you purchase something and never receive it and that is the case for this app so I would actually rate it a zero.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I never purchased the other books in the series. I only purchased this one because of all the hype and I was sorely disappointed. The sex scenes were the same; once you read one it seemed you read them all. Very little variation. I would not recommend this book unless the S & M is truely your thing.
0670024813|5.0|I read this book from cover to cover in about 3 weeks. I thoroughly enjoy it. I'm always fascinated with all of Mr. Diamond's books. He makes it come alive as if... you were on the journey with him. I was not disappointed with this book. A very good historical read indeed.
B00BDZV7WQ|2.0|There some strong tracks but the rest is s***.  Dear wayne please go back to tha carter nd find urself. This is a damn shame
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is a great western series.  If you like long movies this ia a good one.  But you just can't stop at this movie.  You have to get &#34;Return to Lonesome Dove&#34; and &#34;Comanche Moon: The Second Chapter in the Lonesome Dove Saga.&#34;
B00B23O96A|1.0|This is easily Claptons worst CD ever. Could barely make it through one listen, and will not listen to it again. What happened to slow hand??<br /><br />This really sucks EC!
B000JQUZCI|1.0|Movie was a million times better than that stupid story but I will say that it was very poorly written
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|this game is awesome other people should like it to. the reason I like this game is that all the cars flip around and stuff.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|It would be nice if you could make it to wear we don't have to spend our hard<br /><br /> earned cash
B009KEN87O|5.0|I have been enjoying this game for several days and it continues to hold my interest. Challenging and fun to play.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great Grisham book.  Keeps you hanging till the end.  Would recommend it to all Grisham and mystery fans.  A very fun read
B0064T6LV8|3.0|It's okay, although I like a little more of a challenge to a game. It's good for young children to play.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|Just like minecraft but different mobs, tools, and blocks. This is the demo so you don't have multiplayer and you only have 15 minutes to build .should download<br />I give this game a 4
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I give this book 5 stars!!! I give it 5 because it includes all that I love to see in a book; drama, humor, intimacy, and realism.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This production is just outstanding! Would definitely recommend it for any les mis lover, or even if you've never seen it but have an appreciation for music. Alfie Boe- Amazing. Samantha Barks- WONDERFUL! I love her. And then Ramin Karimloo and Hadley Fraser are in it.... I have no words. They're just so soo amazing and outstanding!! Norm Lewis wasn't bad, but personally not my favorite. Lea Salonga was Great! Katie Hall has a beautiful voice and I really enjoyed her as Cossette. I personally did not like Nick Jonas as Marius, but he wasn't too bad. This movie is so great! I have seen it 4 times already and i've only had it for a few days...<br />PS: If you like Ramin Karimloo and Hadley Fraser, I would definitely recommend watching/buying The Phantom of the Opera 25th Anniversary at the Royal Albert Hall. ITS AMAZING!! Even better than Les Miserables in my opinion. Sierra, Hadley, and Ramin make such an excellent cast! It's absolutely my favorite Production! I've seen that more times than I care to admit (probably like 30 times, and I first watched it like a month ago), it's so amazing! Watch it!(:
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am a real fan like so many others. The changes to society in the early 1920's are similar to our own changes today caused by rapidly changing technology. It is interesting to see how people then coped with the changes. Technology has broadened opportunity and the standard of living but has not done anything to change the fundamental character of human beings.
0345803493|5.0|loved it got here sooner then they said it would and the books were packed nicely i will defiently be coming back
B009SQOGZ2|4.0|This is a fun movie,  it didn't turn out like I expected. Really well animated, and v the  story wasn't the norm.  Did a great job branching out.
0345803485|5.0|i would reccomend this book to anyone who likes a good romance i even told my  mom to read it wonderful
B003Y5H574|5.0|The movie was so funny and entertaining. I have seen it multiple times. The story lines were realistic and easy to follow.
0345803507|5.0|great buy so glad i bought all three books each is better then the one before i cant wait to see the movie
0142413828|5.0|it's really a funny story and very suits beginner of English，It tell us a amazing love story and easy to understand .
B00AHHODH2|5.0|The thing I liked the most about The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club was the way the author tied all the characters together in an intricate web of friendships, love, mystery, deceit, envy, infidelity, and murder. The story was almost a fantasy of personal interaction, with a heavy dose of how a group of people can violate just about every one of the Ten Commandments.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book has such amazing detail and story line! The thrill is so awesome with the new characters like the son of Medusa and the God and goddess of the sea monsters! You should read this awesome book! :-)
0425263908|2.0|I was quite disappointed when I finished this book. Because throughout it all, nothing really happens. Well, except sex. Lots of sex. And more sex. Actually, if you deleted all the sex scenes there wouldn't be much left.<br />In the beginning, the book seemed full of possibilities. But then... well, it all kind of watered down... and led nowhere. Well, except to sex ;) It's probably too much to expect from such a book to have a good consistent story. At least the chemistry was good - in the first half of the book. I'm going to read the second part, just to see what all the fuss is about, but I'll probably skip most of the too-long and too drawn-out s.. scenes.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|Lots of action and suspense! Great flick! Ben Affleck, Alan Arkin and John Goodman were great! Highly recommend this movie!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I have seen parts of the movie in other times.. but I payed for this movie and it did not show up in my library.. I didn't even get to watch it.. ok think this is stupid and now because I've already bought it the device will not allow me to buy it again... this is very idiotic and a refund or at least a way to get to my payed movie would be nice... remind me never to buy from this website again....
B005IQZB14|4.0|I was hooked from the beginning to the end.  I was fascinated by the guts it took to take on the PCT. An enjoyable read.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|True entertainment of the highest quality. High-def picture and sound. High-end CGI and effects. Great epic battles and tales.  Superior sets, props, wardrobes and make-up. Stunning cinematography and fantasy world panoramic scenery. A brilliant movie that involves the same elements of black magic, dark underworld evil,  and mythological creatures as scene in both  Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings. Without giving anything away, there WILL be a sequel. Great for the entire family. There are no dry or dull areas in this movie, it hits 0-60 from the start, and Runs about approx. 2hr 40 min. buy it on Blue-ray only! Thanks
1476734941|3.0|I prefer to eat plants and avoid meat and dairy. I find I can sometimes substitute tofu to convert recipes. Will give it a try, but I'm mainly interested in planning for the 500 calorie days.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I didn't enjoy the third book.  I felt the author could have completed the series in book two.  Some of the story lines in this book really had nothing to do with making the relationship any stronger.  However,  once you start a series you should always finish.
B000002HHB|5.0|I have been listening to this CD for a very long time.  As long as I can remember.  It always reminds me of the great memories I have from going to my cabin when I was a kid.  The songs are very well written, in my opinion.  This is a CD I will never forget. Ever.  Highly recommended.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|science,technology,paranormal everything thats good that i like to see its funny,serious,its out there you can feel a connection to the characters.
B000006OAM|5.0|Great CD. I love how different the vibe is from her first solo CD, Tigerlily.  I love the much more orchestral sound in the background, and her awesome lyrics.  A favorite song of mine from Ophelia is \\"Thick as Thieves\\". The score is amazing, and the lyrics and their meaning gives it a little bit more than the other songs, in my opinion.  Natalie's music, both solo and with 10,000 Maniacs, will always be in a special place in my heart. Thanks all.
B005HSL626|2.0|this is a great game, and lots of fun. However, i have had to uninstall and re-download it three times. Every time, sooner or later, it freezes up and stops working. Once it ran for 2 months; the other two times it worked for a day or not at all. I was so disappointed!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Although I liked the book, thought it didn't get into the interesting part of the story until close to the end.
B006WQLH7G|1.0|Does not protect. Recently I was subjected to FRAUD. DO NOT  INSTALL!!!!!!!!!!!! Does not deserve even one rating. Protect yourself with a different app!!!!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Didn't want to put the book down passing it around to my friends.  Glad to hear there is proof that there is a heaven for those who have faith!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|i read this book in high school and i loved it. it makes much more sense to me now that i now what every detail in teh book truly means. everyone should read a classic like this.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 it is a lot better than the original temple run I love the zip line and the mine cart part<br />It is fun and entertaining I am addicted to the game!
B000VWE5OY|4.0|I found this series after watching many seasons of Doctor Who and fell in love with this series.  Honestly, anyone who is a Doctor Who fan will love this series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|i got the 1 st book 50 shades of gray as a gift.<br />i enjoyed it and am anxious to continue reading the next book in this trilogy.
B004QX07G4|2.0|There was no story. Just random thoughts. I thought it would be sort of like an autobiography. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and its disappointing as I really like Ellen.
0399157565|5.0|I got this for a present for someone else. very good book in great shape and just as advertised .
1400069289|5.0|This book is a life changer!  Whether you want to improve just yourself, your friends & family, your company, or even the social fabric of the world- this book has something-no this book has a lot- for everyone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a cool game to play and just pass the time away. Not hard to learn and several levels to play.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is challanging and fun to play. I do find when I play to fast it can lock up my screen.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|After getting introduced to the Piano Guys on YouTube and watching music video after music video, I finally realized they had CDs available and bought one as soon as possible. The song covers are beautiful and brilliant. A couple of my favorites are Code Name Vivaldi and What Makes You Beautiful.<br /><br />We listen to it constantly and still haven't gotten tired of it!
B00A757EFW|4.0|This game brings back good memories as a kid. I still find it worthy. It is fun and can still move fast.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|One of my favorite shows its really witty and written well if your into science or tech stuff its  the best and that dang theme song gets stuck in my head
B003YL4KS0|5.0|Love this book because it really opened my eyes for my hair care and I will read it a second and third and on.... Great book!
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|I can't say anything bad about this group.  They were the actual reason why Gotye is known around the world, but the record industry wouldn't let them take all the credit.  Their cover/video of Somebody That I Used To Know with one guitar proves how amazing they are.  This album is very entertaining and it's the kind of album that you'll love to hear from start to finish like the old days.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|Movie was great but it would stop every minute or so to cache some more.  Restarted several times and it would work for a few but then start stopping every minute or so, again.  Painful!
B00AZKCU7G|4.0|I purchased the bluray set and purchased the 4 part bluray which has the bluray, DVD format, the bonus disc and the digital copy. Initially it looked like any other bluray I had purchased in the past but then I opened it and saw that here were only 2 discs...then upon further inspection found that the discs were stacked...really? Touchstone can do better than that. I purchased this for about $30.00 which is not expensive but it is not cheap either-What I expected was a little flapping the middle as a divider with the 2 discs in it.<br /><br />I also was not impressed by the BONUS disc. I was expecting a little more information on the making of the movie and background production. Like the makeup and hair (even though Tommy Lee Jones wig was the most horrible one I have ever seen..it looked horrible) and costuming alone I thought would have a larger portion because by the looks of it it seems like it was a very large task. Also I expected more information about the set dressing and building of sets and information about locations...I guess I was also expecting more backstory. It was fine but if I could go back I would just buy the regular bluray of just the movie... And saved myself some money. So on the just the bluray I give it 3 stars.<br /><br />My favorite genre of movie is very early American history and early European history...so this gravitation to like this movie was natural. How the movie was filmed and the atmosphere that was created through lighting and the cinematography was just perfect...condisering everything back in the day was lit by candle, natural light or gas light it was perfectly filmed...it was believeable as if you were sitting in the room as an observer during that period of time.<br />I did appreciate that the movie only covered a very short period of time rather than Lincoln's entire presidency (it covers the addition of the 13th amendment) I think it it tried to cover everything the movie would have movie way too fast and I think there would have been the want for more movie.<br /><br />I know I have heard some individuals in reviews and amongst the people I know stating the movie went way too slow...one thing that I did learn from the bonus disc that it was on purpose...but I will agree that in some areas of the film they drug it out a bit too much...like the vote...I almost yelled at my TV vote already...<br /><br />DDL was amazing...his acting and embodying Lincoln was amazing-the way he walked, spoke and carried himself...I imagine if I had met Lincoln that this is exactly what he would behave like.  His wardrobe, makeup and hair just added to his believability. I completely understood why he won the Oscar.<br /><br />There was one person if I was making the movie I would have pulled it was David Strathairn as Sec. William H. Seward I just couldn't remove him from his characters in Leauge of thier Own or We Are Marshall (in those movies I enjoyed him very much)..I cringed every time he spoke (which unfortunately was a lot) it just appeared that he was the same characters he played in other movies just in period appropriate wardrobe. I think there could have been a better choice for this part.<br /><br />I did enjoy that they cast individuals that looked very similar to the actual real live people (I did some research after). I was watching the movie for about the 2nd time when I though I saw James Spader...then I looked up the cast and saw indeed it was James Spader...I was very surprised as I know him from the 1980's in Pretty in Pink...that was a nice surprise.<br /><br />I have already watched this movie over a few times. Overall a well made movie even though I question some of the people cast. On the movie I give it 4 stars.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|Its interrupted several times, show fuzzy quality of pictures<br />I use it on ROKU and netflix give me no problem for $8.99 per month<br />but at amazon you pay for rent and get nothing<br />we disappointing
B0019N95IK|5.0|First off I watched Enterprise from start to finish so I was not one who tuned out. Second I thought the casting was great and the writing was excellent (as with any star trek shows there are always a few episodes that are hard to love but there are more than enough that you love outright)I think access was the main problem for most people. I am sure they went to friend's houses so as not to miss the premier but this could not be done every week (I am assuming). Luckily our cable company carried it. The other reason for lack of ratings was the fact that everyone who seemed to be criticising the show never saw the show. they were going by what others had said or what they read from critics. And anyone who is a true fan of science fiction will tell you, Most critics (though not all) have no clue what Star Trek or even Science Fiction is all about. So why listen to them? I have always been the type who read reviews but could filter out useless opinion (for instance they'd have a writer review a show like Star Trek, when they are not even A Sci Fi Fan). But, even if the review was scathing I'd still have to judge it for myself. The only thing as a fan, that I can say may have alienated some people (who do not get the priveledge to watch week to week) is that season 3 was one major story arc. I understand how that can seem a bit tired after awhile, but it was very ambitious and actually well executed, and seeing the borg episode was great as well. My only issue with the series, as I've said the cast/writing/directing were great, is that the final episode made no sense and even included old star trek stars, rather than focusing on the enterprise crew. I do not blame the writers etc for this, as I am under the impression they had little notice that they were being canceled and so they cobbled something together to give the show closure, however it just gave most fans convulsions:). I am glad that this series is getting the blu ray treatment I have bought every star trek blu ray so far, and they have done a great job. and it seems that Star Trek as a whole always does better with video releases than they do with ratings/grosses. And it's nice to see that Paramount isn't taking the easy way out and they are not only in it for the money (obviously any company would be) but they are giving the fans a great presentation of the show on enough discs (no excess compression, everything is spread out to take advantage of the blu ray's size) and they get a plethora of extras. Everything is well produced and done well. Giving Star Trek new life, and perhaps adding a new audience. While JJ Abrams may be giving a breath of fresh air to the franchise, we must remember it's these series that gave it life, Everything Roddenberry dreamed of, every hope, every wishful thought flows from the screen in each episode. Humanity may not be perfect, but when we balance the good and the bad of mankind, ultimately we find the good always outweighs the bad. And that is what Roddenberry wanted to share with us: Hope. And Enterprise does a great job and perpetuating that theme. We may not be the best we can be...but eventually we'll get there. Perhaps going where no one has gone before isn't about the exploration of new species and galaxies but about understanding ourselves and our place in that galaxy. For anyone on  the fence about buying the blu rays, my advice is to buy it now so you won't regret it later:) you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I must also add that when TNG came out, everyone was rather negative yet the ratings were high. And there were a lot more rougher episodes to watch than the enterprise has (though I must add seeing tng on blu ray has made it easier to judge the series as the look/feel of the remastered video leaves the only criticism left for the actual writing/acting). Maybe now on Blu ray people can give the crew of the Enterpise a fair shot. I know a lot of people didn't like Bacula for the captain as he was in another iconic sci fifranchise, Quantum Leap and apparently you can't star in two major franchises of the same genre. Bacula makes it work though and the human way in which they all act in the beginning before starfleets regulations were formulated, is an interesting take on space travel. We are not the holier-than-thou space farers intent on protecting the galaxy, we are very human explorers who want to satiate their curiostiy and well stay alive while doing so. And they are in over their heads. Of course they tech of star trek, in going backwards, was hard to come up with, how can you simplify the communicators of TOS when in today's time frame we have smaller more technologically advanced looking cell phones? sure we can dial into space (yet) but the look of the tech now makes TOS look silly. Unless of course you view it for what it is, and now what you want it to be. which seems to be what a lot of negative sci fi fans are doing, they aren't judging the show by what it does, or what it shows, but by what it didnt' show or do that the reviewer was hoping they'd do. That's probably why Lucas sold Lucasfilm he was tired of everyone yelling at him for doing the movies the way he wanted to do them, they belong to him after all. So why not just enjoy the show for what it is rather that what our expectations had hoped they'd be. This really is an excellent series...so anyone who is on the fence I say go for it. You may see it in a different light now that it's on Blu Ray. The extras alone are a huge selling point for this set...and the series is phenomenal.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|I usually write longer reviews, but this movie just doesn't warrant it. All of these movies are dumb and require the suspension of disbelief. Having said that, I have liked watching the others. Turn off your brain and they are silly and fun. This addition, however, was boring and made no sense. They stopped even trying to make up a storyline that resembles anything close to a plot. Again, this movie is sooo boring.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I love the mentalist and I know most people think the Red John thing is over done. I have a feeling no one will ever see it coming when he is revealed but I think I know who Red John is. worth at the very least you should watch the first season. If you love mystery. Most of all if you hate always knowing who done it before the first five mins are over.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It really made me want to read more. I read it day and night. It's a book worth the money.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|got this alittle later than  I would have planned but it was in great condition. there was no problems with the dvd
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I chose this application because I always have trouble finding a basic eight digit calculator. I thought this application would be perfect for fulfilling that requirement.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AWESOME! And, I found out what minecraft was all because of this game!!! So, It`s basically my favourite minecraft game, actually, maybe the only minecraft game that really isn't a glitch. I'm just glad it isn't just freaking PICTURES. But if you haven't downloaded this game, download the game &quot;Minecraft Pocket Edition Lite&quot;!
B0019LZV4E|5.0|I really enjoyed this.. more than I thought I would.  I love all things Tim Burton, so keep that in mind regarding my review.  I truly love the collaboration of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter.<br />The cinematography was great- the sets and backdrops were spot on.  It was sad in the beginning, and creepy heading towards gross at the end :)  But that is the story...and it was done well.  I was surprised at the okay-ness of Johnny Depp's singing.  I thought I was going to be disappointed, but it was passable for the part he played. Helena did a great job singing.  And of course the creepy teacher , Severus Snape from Harry Potter films as the Judge was great.  He is always good as a bad guy!<br />Overall, I loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone who is a Tim Burton fan, a Johnny Depp fan, or a fan of sad, twisted musicals :)
0345479092|5.0|I read this book while I was breastfeeding my son, I learned so much with it, it was the best maternity book I read.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|kinda. boring after a while. have to keep playing to get anywhere.<br /> very repetitive and limited in what you can explore.
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|Hi it was working fine, now it is asking for Re installation. I cannot re install it.  I thought having the paid version would solve the problem. It works for 2 minutes and ask for reinstallation again and again.
B00BF123WG|2.0|Why they stretched a movie that should have been no more than 90 minutes into this 160 minute marathon is beyond me.  My wife is still mad at me for making her sit through this thing.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I started watching this show during the airing of season 2 and I am hooked.  Its so thrilling and well produced.  From the moment you start watching, even if you haven't seen previous episodes, you become engaged in the plot and intrigued by the well developed characters.  I was locked to the couch for a couple days watching both seasons and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed!
B008OOYALE|5.0|U do need wifi for this game but it is very fun. U can set eggs in a nest with baby dragons inside them. Some eggs hatch faster than others. The fastest egg would probably take about 20 seconds. The more u play the game the more dragon eggs u can get. I highly recommend this game if u like dragons and cute critters.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I didn't learn about this show until it was in season 3 and wow did I miss out.  Be warned, if you start watching this, it is nearly impossible to stop.  Be prepared for late nights watching all of the episodes.  Its time well spent.  The story is based off a chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with cancer and wants to make some money to leave behind for his family.  He decides to cook crystal meth with his chemistry background and cooks the best stuff the world has ever seen.  From the very first episode of the first season, they squeeze what could be a whole season into one episode and it leaves you wondering what could happen next.  At the end of every episode is a massive debilitating cliff hanger that forces you to watch the next episode (even if you don't want to).  Clear up a week and watch this.  You won't be disappointed!
0802473156|5.0|This is a great book. it help me put my thoughts and action in perspective with my mate. I recommend Gary Chapman books for all. Applying the methods aka languages will enhance your relationships.<br /><br />Wonderfully Happy,<br />Lynn
B003O86FMW|4.0|Felt more like filler than anything else, but it was still a good read. Still looking forward to book three.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was spellbound from beginning to the end.  Having worked with emotionally disturbed people most of my l life, this book touched me in a special way.  I loved how Pat (the main character) showed concern for people who were considered \\"rejects.\\"  I wanted to hope with him as he looked for his silver lining.  I thought the author did a descent job developing the characters in this book.  I felt as if I \\"knew\\" each one and appreciated how each interacted with Pat.  A very good read.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I just purchased Nightmares From the Deep: The Cursed Heart at the special full unlock price for 99&cent;! I have only been playing for about a half hour but it asked me to leave a review so I decided to do so as I am enjoying the game very much so far. This is only the second game of this type I have played. The first I only played the free version and decided not to purchase it because it was slow going and I did not think I would finish it. Nightmares is entertaining, I want to know what is going to happen next and want to continue playing. I am very happy it was on sale as I truly think I will really enjoy playing and prob would not have even tried it had it  been full price. If the game continues to be as good as it is so far I will likely purchase more of these kinds of games!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"After the raw beauty of \\"Slammed\\" & \\"Point of Retreat\\" Colleen Hoover has done it again with her novel \\"Hopeless\\"; gut-wrenching, engrossing & unforgettable. I'm sitting in tears after finishing it thinking 'What the frick do I do now!?'. An absolute must-read! :)\\" {Reviewed on Goodreads 12th Feb 2013}
B000SEFNMS|3.0|I am a fan of Krakauer. My favorite book of all time is &#34; Into Thin Air&#34;  which I thought was amazing. I also read &#34;under the banner of Heaven&#34;. Into the Wild was a good read but I loved parts of it and hated others. The book became more engaging towards the end but to be honest, I felt the author was trying to fill pages due to the lack of content. Can't really blame him as he wrote the book with the help of interviewing people and pages from a journal.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed and would recommend it.
B009KEN87O|4.0|A fun version of space invaders. Wasn't sure about the auto fire, but it works out just fine. Excellent free app of the day!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a real heart filled love story.  I liked it a lot and cannot wait to read the next book.  This is my second reading of the trilogy.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|After listening to the album plus the 4 extra tracks I am blown away.There is nobody like these guys.One of the most underrated groups of all time have continued to get better with age.It is obvious anyone who gives a bad review of this album truly has not followed there career.With all that aside not every song on the new album is great but so much better than the Top 40 schlock out there nowadays.It seems more spiritual and uplifting than some of there other works.Buy this album if you want to listen to some of the best music of the year.Sincerely,Jason.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this app. have it on my smart phone and my Kindle HD. if i were in vegas, i would be way, waay ahead!
0385349947|5.0|This hits the mark, don't judge before you read it yourself. Ms Sandberg provides good practical advice and facts from studies that you can apply to your daily work life- I love the facts from Harvard studies about how we think every day, to make us REthink these decisions such- how we pick our teams ! And a call to end the Monmy wars is so timely as well. Love this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a one of the best games on amazon!!!THATS WHY ITS OFF THE CHAIN!!!!!!!Get it and you won't regret it. And  its free. When do we get games that are really good and  that are free now a days?  I'm a kid so i recommend this addictive game to all ages!!!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I highly recommend downloading this app. I haven't seen any inappropriate ads yet (as mentioned in other reviews) and the ads that are shown are unobtrusive. It's so easy to use I was downloading my favorite videos immediately!  The download feature provides numerous options for size, several different file types to choose from (both for video and / or just the video sound) which allows the downloaded files to be playable on a wide variety of tablets, phones, and computers. I recommend checking your system requirements for file types that are compatible prior to downloading anything. You also put in file names yourself if you want - I suggest doing so as otherwise the first viewable line for text will be blank, making it harder to find the specific saved file later in your video / music areas.<br />The search function is great and all of the original YouTube options are available.<br />I'm using it on a Kindle Fire without HD as I originally thought I'd primarily be reading and using my iPad for everything else. Now that I've been using this app I'm on my Kindle more than my iPad.<br /><br />This is definitely a &quot;must-have&quot; app!  Without question, you'll love it!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Th his was a good book.  It got slow at times . But all and all it was very good.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Great Story!  Great visuals, both natural and computerized!  Our 8-yr old Grand-daughter loved it;  as did my wife and I.  I recommend it for viewers of all ages.
0792844890|5.0|space balls is another good one like Mel brooks he is a funny comedian with his other movies plus you see a knock off of planet of the apes in space balls the movie it is like star wars vs star trek
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno Mars is an awesome singer. I love the way his songs tell story. And there is always something to do with the moon! You gotta love it. MOONSHINE!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it was a great. there is new things like when u start u jump on this rope and grids down to the 2 part.
B0041KVX1A|5.0|This is arguably the Beatles' best and most-underrated album. This attention-grabbing masterwork holds up well beyond what could have ever been imagined back in 1964 when it was released to a compelling audience. I consider AHDN the 'perfect album', because the songwriting is so exceedingly crafted, coupled with expert arrangements and, of course, flawless performances. Human emotion seamlessly bursts through so strongly, you will ask yourself how an album could be so excellent. This might only come about a few times during one's lifetime.<br /><br />The sides were live studio take performances with only minimal overdubs, creating a raw energy central to connect with the listener. It is a lost art form, missing in today's cut and paste world of multi-track gimmicks and trickery. There is something to be said about the `less is more' adage and this album is living proof, e.g., (2) guitars, a little piano, bass, drums, percussion, harmonies. It simply cannot get any better than what the boys did on this stunning magnum opus!<br /><br />This album radiates from four young lads, who were barely into their adulthood, exuding with enough combined testosterone to blow the lid off the music world. Nothing has ever come close. The state-of-the-art 180-gram vinyl remaster is an essential must have for any music lover - especially the Beatle aficionado. Its sound will astound even the most discriminating music appreciation enthusiast. If you only buy five of these 180-gram gems, make sure this is in your collection - you will never lament over your choice purchase!
B008ASGP3U|4.0|The plot may not be fresh but it's all about old friends you have known for a long time. Lets hope rebus passes his physical.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|As always Pendergast is on top of his game and Preston/Child are able to keep you interested from cover to cover.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's perfect for my needs. easy and simple to use, very easy.large easy to read numbers.very simple functions thank you
B0000DG00B|5.0|All Allman Brother fans won't be sorry to add this to their collection. It's great to hear Duane's amazing slide guitar performance. This 2 cd set is unique to say the least. It contains the opening set of this July festival in 1970, and the closing set, both by the Allman Brothers Band. Thom Doucette plays harmonica on both sets. The first set started at 3:00 P.M. on July 3, 1970 and it contains their then-new, first instrumental written by Dickey Betts, &#34;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&#34;, whose title came from a tombstone in the Macon County Cemetery where the &#34;boys&#34; slipped away to, to get some &#34;quiet time&#34;. The rumor being, it was named when Dickey finished the song and was asked what the title was. Dickey turned around and read the tombstone he was leaning against. Also included is &#34;Hoochie Coochie Man&#34; sung by Berry Oakley.<br />The second set [on cd #2] started about 3:50 A.M. on July 6, 1970. As you could imagine, the Brothers were &#34;primed&#34;. They had witnessed performances by Jimi Hendrix, Jethro Tull, Ten Years After, Grand Funk Railroad, B.B. King, Mountain, Captain Beefheart, and Johnny Winter. So guess what. They invited Johnny Winter to join them on the final song, a 28 minute recording of &#34;Mountain Jam&#34; which also features a bass solo from Berry Oakley and lasted until the sun shone brightly on a warm mid-summer day in Georgia. Even though two tracks suffered with intonation [tuning] problems due to the damp night air, Gregg is undaunted and right on pitch, never singing any better. So give yourself a treat. Buy this 2 cd set, turn up your stereo, close your eyes, and take a trip back in time where the music doesn't get any better!
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I read this book in one day because I was so intrigued.  Although I could never see myself going to the extent that Amy Chua did with her daughters, I feel a lot better about some of the conflicts I have experienced since becoming a parent.  At the very least, the book opens some questions that I believe need to be opened in the community of parents in this country right now.  It's not about liking what she says or not, it's about seeing another point of view.  I'm very glad I read it.
1932100660|5.0|Great book if you're looking for scientific information on your journey to a plant-based diet. It's definitely a study and not a novel though, so be prepared for scientific vocabulary and take your time reading it. I enjoyed this book and have bought a copy for a friend.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Read it now the second time. The third time is around the corner.  Too bad there only one more book.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Installs easily and does what it is supposed to do. No muss, no fuss no bother. Pleasant and varied selection of alarm tones and easily readable clock.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Fred and Bing ..what a duo .  I love The movie White Christmas ... but this movie is where it all began with that wonderful Christmas song. The story line is light and cute ...pure entertainment !
B0076DELIG|1.0|This is another great Harry Bosch story.  It took a short while to get going and I am not sure that all the stuff with his daughter was necessary (background for when Harry retires).  However, McConnell got back on track and ran with it!  The plot is well thought out and timely.  It makes sense and draws the reader into the story.  Very good read.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I am not a television fan at all, but when I seen Season 1, Episode 1, I was hooked!  Best show on television hands down.  Worth my time!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Four stars because it was a fun easy read. I could not help but turn the page. But I will not miss these characters.
B00942G4UA|4.0|After I saw how our food is grown in the fields, how cow milk is processed with all the antibiotics injected into the cows and how our meat is butchered after the animals are fed unnatural feeds (corn, for example, to beef cattle) which make them sick and then they are doctored with  antibiotics and also fed hormones to make them gain weight faster!  Now the sequester and budget cuts are slashing the number of USDA inspectors to insure our food is safe!  This is only the tip of the iceberg!  Chickens are crammed into cages where they can't even exercise normally because they can't move!  The chicks and also turkeys are so fat that they keel over and so are thrown in the trash!  After I saw that film, I did not go  grocery shopping for 2 weeks, and then when I did, I would only buy products that had not been injected with hormones and/or antibiotics!  Gross!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is the best shark game out whether its iOS or Android! Its really fun you get to kill alot of fishes, boats, and people, you basically go on rage, you can buy gear for you shark, buy upgrades for your sharks, and but abilities theres also missions to so you dont get bored&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;in which you probably wont, so yea get this game its free and its pretty much a big deal!
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This is an extremely well-written book; the best I've read in a long time. It was so good to read about a 17-year-old who actually likes her parents and little brother. Her relationship with her boyfriend is somewhat rocky. The music theme holds it all together, and it's interesting that the hero is deeply into classical music. The author did a great job of explaining Mia's relationship with the ones she loves through little vignettes in between hospital/medical scenes. The book gripped me right from the start, and I read it pretty much in one sitting. It's been a long time since a book has held my attention like that. This book will stay with me for a long time.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Really makes you wonder what they will come up with next. If you like sci fi pretty good series to watch
B00338QENI|4.0|It was good, but had a too much technical information for my taste.  In parts, also, it seemed redundant.  I wish authors would not think that their book had to have more pages to be good.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Like having windows explorer on your kindle.  Needed this to download unknown apps and install them.  Necessary if you want to explore the files.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun and addictive game. However it does not give you much options for gathering energy and its difficult to find all the objects needed to fight off the bad guys. I didn't like having to play with friends in order to pass some parts either.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Subscribing to Showtime is expensive.  Buying the first season was reasonable.  I understand all the awards the show has gotten.  It's a good series.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This one is as good as the first or better! So happy they came out with another game. Fun, another great game!!
B004UID2LC|4.0|Not a BIG You Tube user.  I often enjoy the videos.  I just don't do it often.  Perhaps I will consider watching more.

B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Don't waste your $$ it was so hyped up that we thought it would be a good one to watch.  It wasn't.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|The greatest load of rubbish I have read ever ever. the mills and boon drivel i used to read as a teenager are like high brow literature compared to this . Not even the &#34;sexy&#34; bits are sexy . give us a &#34;bodice ripper&#34; any day . Over hyped drivel and i'm worse for buying it
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A lot of readers have expressed that the book is to fragmented and there's to many abberations from the core of the story but for me it's a way of nuancing the great telling. So I won't be able to judge the books qualities before the following parts of the story reveals the necessity af whats told in this book. Until so far I was entertained and have not lost the interest for the characters.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Very enjoyable book but didn't like the ending . You want justice and not capitulation at the end but it doesn't always work like that.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|As kindle fire doesn't have the facility to play other file types like avi this application is certainly the one to get. I was looking for an application which plays other file types and this application came in handy. You should get it too. I have been using it for quite a while now and it hasn't given me any problem.
B004YD1KTO|5.0|Really heartwrenching , You feel for them all and want to ending to turn out good. your not expecting the end
B009MO5ES8|5.0|I really love this movie. It's really different.  The bicycle riding in this movie is INCREDIBLE!  Great action, good story, and incredible cycling!  Love Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  He's so good in this movie as is Michael Shannon who plays the \\"bad\\" guy.  Definitely catch this movie.
B001N3OCV6|5.0|One of my favoriet movies of all times... backed by GREAT music from some of THE greatest performers of all time
B00ANGICRE|5.0|This movie was really interesting and an excellent portrayal of a true story about a man who was born with polio and had to live in an \\"iron lung\\" and how he was able to have a very fulfilling love life.  It's funny, and sad, and very moving.  The main characters Helen Hunt and John Hawkes are outstanding as is William Macy also.  I definitely recommend this movie.  Very entertaining, and Very interesting.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|best ele uno game I've played have to figure out how to play on line with my friends and family got to get them to buy it
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Talk about a quality movie - WOW !!!  It was an amazing influence on my husband.  The humor was GREAT and we still laugh and talk about our favorite scenes.  My husband became part of a small group and even had a ceremony just as it was in the movie ! If you like a movie with great values and has examples of true integrity- get it !!!

B004C4IKCU|5.0|Bought as a gift.  I do not enjoy being told how many words to write, that's why I don't do this often
B000000H64|4.0|This is what I grew up listening to, and loving as a teen.  Though I think their first work is better, Demanufacture is a solid album, good song after good song.  Like their first effort, this one has a lot of really good songs.  As song writers, this work is more refined than the first one, and I think that is a minus.  Piss Christ is my favorite song on this album.
B0026P3G12|5.0|CD was great, I really shouldn't have to write any more than that.  This is the pits.  Please change it.
B00AO2ZMB6|5.0|r rated crime drama, lot of violent acts, plenty gunfire, blood and<br />gut. language is profane at times and lots of sexual situations. it<br />is entertaining for mature adults.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Plenty of melee fighting with slight amount of coin and rewards in each level. Easy to move through the 'rooms' but very slow upgrading without spending real-life hard currency.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|a lot of old footage will bring back memories of the sad years of the<br />late 70's when this country was embarrassed by the like of zealots in<br />the middle east. this episode was one of the few good things to come<br />out of this era. the actors in this somewhat factual account of the<br />rescue of some diplomats that escape is well done and acted well.
0345410025|5.0|It worked far better than I thought.  This is all I really wanted to say so five more words required!
B008Y73940|5.0|excellent legal thriller about a kind of sleazy lawyer working out of a big<br />car,hence the name. he is a good legal mind and knows all the tricks. I felt<br />it was an entertaining movie and drama fans will enjoy.
034580404X|5.0|Best books I ever read I read all three books in five days .Good story line very steamy books but I would say these books are for adults only don't let your teenagers read these. They have way to much sexual detail for a minor.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The music and songs of this highlight album are so wonderful that I keep it in my pick up all the time. When I listen to it, as soon as it ends, I let it start again from the beginning. At times, I've listened to it four times without ejecting the CD.
B00881VLCE|5.0|its a great puzzle game...and getting better each time i play it. you can add more puzzle photos as you like.<br />Magic Puzzles ... great for long trips in the family rv or car. I gave it five stars...:)
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have DVDs of the tenth and twenty fifth anniversary concerts and they are fabulous to watch. I also have a CD with highlights from the motion picture. Les Miserables is the finest play/music of its kind. It's been staged since 1985 and I hope to own the fiftieth concert performance as well.

B0031TZASY|4.0|This book was nothing like I expected and at times seemed a little far fetched, without giving anything away the chapters on the &#34;island&#34; almost made me give up, but perseverance paid off and by the end of the book I saw the whole big picture and what a great ending indeed, I never would have guessed.<br />Got the video last week and it is worth getting, follows the book perfectly, which is unusual for any movie!
B008EKOO46|5.0|I found this book while looking for references to back my claim that capitalist culture is toxic (for my sociology class) and it really helped as a point of reference to dispute capitalist culture. It is relevant, incredibly well written, and a perception altering, first hand account in to a number of fascinating cultures.  Really good read.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I have listened to \\"Monster\\" many times. I guess that it is incredible creation by my favourite band. The most interesting tracks which have caught my attention are: \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\", \\"Freak\\", \\"Back to the stone age\\", \\"The devil is me\\" (it is probably the best track on a whole CD); \\"Eat your heart out\\" (It feels like old smashing sound which KISS used to make on \\"Hotter than Hell\\", \\"Dressed to kill\\", \\"Rock and roll over\\" or \\"Love gun\\"); \\"All for the love of rock and roll\\" (This song might be regarded as one of the greatest hits by KISS as for example: \\"Rock and roll all nite\\", \\"God gave rock and roll to you\\").<br />In brief, I would say that the newest production by KISS resembles their glorious past (especially KISS in the 70s). In general, \\"Monster\\" is tougher and heavier than \\"Hot in the shade\\" or \\"Sonic Boom\\". According to me, it is even more impressive than \\"Revenge\\", \\"Psycho Circus\\", \\"Animalize\\", \\"Carnival of Souls\\", \\"Lick it up\\" or \\"Creatures of the night\\". I love this CD. Tommy Thayer, Eric Singer (\\"youngsters\\")as well as Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley (senior members) still make us believe that KISS is the hottest band in the world.

B009CPEOC4|3.0|I'm not a huge Katy Perry fan, but was interested in how she handled her marital  difficulties during a huge World Tour.  It was brave to share it, but also mercenary.  Katy's a huge talent, but following in the Material Girl's footsteps here.
B000002OX5|5.0|This album doesn't get the same amount of credit as some of the The Who's other albums like Tommy, The Who Sell Out, and Quadrophenia, but there are a lot of great songs here as well. This album really showcases Pete Townsend's ability to write catchy songs and lyrics. The album has a bit of a pop feel to it, but it's also got the great guitar, bass, and drums that you expect from a rock legend like The Who.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I love this low-key drama of a middle-aged woman (Streep) who misses sex and love which have disappeared in her long marriage to a stodgy CPA (Jones).  The story is held with a certain dramatic range, there are no hysterics, yet important and realistic points are addressed.  Very nice scenery in New England also.  One difficulty is Steve Carrell playing a purely dramatic role.  Not the best choice, because of his huge exposure in comic performances.  It unfortunately detracts from the overall quality, as he is not a dramatic actor in the class of Streep and Jones.
0062073192|5.0|Purchased this for a friend that is a major Supernatural fan, he was blow away with the detail in the book. Got the item in two days. Great buy for any fan.
B006RXPY3C|4.0|At times watching this movie, I realize that I am watching Helen Mirren and not the actual Queen.  A stellar acting effort.  Martin Sheen is fantastic as Tony Blair as well.  Brilliant casting.  The story is poignant and very touching, the period when Princess Diana dies in a car accident.  Obviously this story's depiction of the royal family's reaction is pure conjecture.  The storyline of the stag that the Queen accosts in the Scottish highlands was brilliant, however it probably never happened.  Yet it makes for a great story, especially the mythic Diana being goddess of the hunt, this stag being hunted and killed.  A very imaginative bit of genius.
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|Life lesson followed by life lesson. So many relatable scenarios in any persons life to this book. Made me think twice about a lot of personal decisions made.
B00BHU2A7I|2.0|Anthony Hopkins is covered in so much makeup in this movie, he's unrecognizable.  I'm going to assume that he did his homework in how Hitchcock behaved, and I suppose he was not a very likeable guy.  The story is about the huge risk Hitchcock took in making &#34;Psycho&#34;, which really isn't a very interesting story, imho.  Helen Mirren's character was rather blah, no scenes deserving of her great talent.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|This album does not disappoint. I know writing a review for a music album is very subjective, but this album met my expectations. The music style is persistent and hold to the long tradition of Depeche Mode synthesizer sound.

They make my purchases easy and inexpensive, since I'm an senior on a budget.
B008Y5OWMK|3.0|In Johnson County, Wyoming, in 1892, a cartel of stockowners obtains the consent of the governor and the President to rid their land of \\"thieves and anarchists\\". They have a list of 125 residents, mostly German and Eastern European immigrants, who are to be executed by their army of mercenaries. Marshall Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson) is not only dismayed by the injustice, but by the fact that the list includes his mistress Ella (Isabelle Huppert), who runs the local brothel, and who shares her affections with Stock Association foreman Nate Champion (Christopher Walken). The townspeople are divided - some want to give up their neighbours whose names are on the list - but after a spirited meeting on the floor of Heaven's Gate, the town's roller-skating rink (sic), owned by John L. Bridges (Jeff Bridges), they decide to fight.<br /><br />This unfolds over 3 hours and 39 minutes, with pauses for, amongst other things, a massive choreographed waltz, stolen directly from Visconti's The Leopard, at a Harvard graduation ceremony (which, confusingly, was filmed in Oxford, which accounted for why it looked exactly like Oxford), a cockfight, some roller skating, Kristofferson and Huppert dancing around the deserted rink accompanied by local musicians (with a fiddle player who cavorted like Jake Busey in Starship Troopers), Nate showing off the wallpaper in his log cabin while Mickey Rourke (as a character who shares his name with 1950s director Nick Ray, but serendipitously was actually an historical figure) listens to a story about wolf hunting, and a town meeting which might be making stirring arguments against government-sanctioned genocide by rich landowners, except it's conducted entirely in un-subtitled Immigrant. There was also a point at which Averill started reading the names on the death list, structured: name - reaction shot of victim - outraged murmuring from others in crowd - repeat. After the first four names, I began to fear we might see all 125.<br /><br />The love triangle between Averill, Ella and Nate didn't greatly engage me. This might have been because Huppert capers about like a sprite in her early scenes, and later is unable to take the hint and get the hell out of town despite a narrow escape and the clear indication of impending doom. She just didn't seem that much of a catch, apart perhaps from being the only woman within hundreds of miles who seemed to have mastered English. Kristofferson was appropriately stoic and decent, although it's never explained why a Yankee silvertail felt the need to seek employment as a marshal in rural Wyoming. Walken commands the screen and moves with his dancer's grace. I can't tell you much more about their characters, but their wardrobe has stayed with me: both men wearing ties in every scene, Kristofferson's brown suits, Walken's crazily high-peaked hat, pale suit and long coat draped off his shoulders like Mitchum's in Out of the Past, if the colours had been done by Armani. Which, as well as the incredible leisureliness, sums up the other problem of Heaven's Gate: a compulsion toward lavish beauty, at the expense of all the other elements that ordinarily make a film a film.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges didn't look for a second like he belonged in a period film, which was down to his face and his bearing, but compounded by his beard and his outfit - Russian peasant's cap, tie, two-tone cardigan - which created an oddly precise impression of a contemporary inner-city hipster. Rather than dispensing quadruple whiskies, I expected him to offer Kristofferson fair trade soy lattes.<br /><br />John Hurt played a Harvard classmate of Kristofferson's who ended up a landowner in Wyoming, siding with the assassins but occasionally troubled by his tiny and ineffectual conscience, and uttering non-poetic non-profundities between pulls on a hip flask. If there has ever been a more redundant film character, I cannot recall it.<br /><br />I was daunted coming to this film by the dual challenges of the overwhelmingly negative criticism it received upon its release (the incomparable Pauline Kael basically said all there is to say) and the positive backlash that accompanied the release of the Criterion discs, and the legendary profligacy of its making. In short, this was the film that destroyed United Artists, which can be attributed to things like Cimino pulling down an entire set to widen a road by six feet. As it turns out, it's pretty straightforward to form an opinion about the film itself, which is vastly too long to support its simple plot, and not especially good. Not only do the three leads fail to engage, but the marked-for-death immigrants are given no distinguishing characteristics that couldn't be discerned from still photographs - nothing about them as people to care about.<br /><br />What is extraordinary is Vilmos Zsigmond's photography of the breathtaking Wyoming locations. It is said of some films that every frame could be a work of art in itself, and that's truer of Heaven's Gate than anything else I've seen. Not only the framing but the quality of the light is flawlessly chosen to make everything look exquisite, no matter how lacking in inherent dramatic or narrative value.<br /><br />It's clear that the fortune spent on this film didn't all go on cocaine. The sets and costumes are incredibly elaborate, even for locations that are used for a single scene, and even if some of the actors don't convince us we're seeing 1892 Wyoming, the production design does.<br /><br />I don't regret correcting my failure before now to see this notorious and controversial film, but I can't strongly recommend it.

B008220DGE|3.0|The 6th movie in director Paul Thomas Anderson's filmography, 'The Master'  tells the story of a world war II naval veteran (Joaquin Phoenix) who meets the leader of a religious movement (Philip Seymour Hoffman)  known as 'the cause', who welcomes him and has him join his group, and all the repercussions their relationship brings to their lives and 'the cause'. While the movie never mentions it, it is clear that the movement is loosely based on scientology.<br /><br />Like the prior films from director PTA, it is a polarizing film, you either love it or hate it. Cinematography is great and the movie was actually photographed in 65mm, the DVD holds up pretty well when upscaled in a  Sony Bluray player. The acting, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman in the role of the charismatic movement leader, is superb (though I do not understand Amy Adams' nomination as she barely has any screen time)  This is definitely PTA's darker film to date, and that is already much to say considering he is the one who gave us films like 'Magnolia', 'There will be blood' and 'Boogie nights'<br /><br />Would I recommend it? If you are a PTA fan this is a must, casual viewers who liked PTA's prior films may have it easier watching this, but the story and the characters are so dark that I can understand why someone would be put off by this film. My personal opinion, while I liked it, it is my least favorite film from PTA's filmography.<br /><br />Should you get the Bluray or the DVD? Unlike prior films in which music was a factor ('Magnolia'). That is not the case with 'The master', the DVD version contains a Dolby  Digital 5.1 track that sounds great in a well configured Home Theater. The picture quality is actually pretty good, a Bluray will definitely deliver better sound and picture quality, but in my opinion, films like this one do not benefit that much from the HD, but that's just me.<br /><br />What is included in the DVD? The movie is presented in 1.85:1 letterbox format, anamorphic widescreen and contains subtitles both in English (for the hearing impaired) and Spanish. Only one audio track is included, English Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Additionally, the extras include outtakes, teaser/trailers and a short behind the scenes titled \\"Unguided message\\". Fans of the film should be surprised by the inclusion of a picture of Philip Seymour Hoffman's character as an extra with the DVD, which is one of the pictures Freddie Quell takes in the movie (included an image in the product description)escreen and contains subtitles both in English (for the hearing impaired) and Spanish.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have always loved scary movies but have never like gore. That being said I can't get enough of this show. Just enough gore to please the Saw fans out there but not enough to keep me from watching.

1401235417|5.0|I have to say, I love this story line. Its a good old Detective story, with clues at every page, rituals, and just sheer bad-assery.<br />I don't want to write any more in fear of spoiling any part of the adventure. I'm just going to say it was SO GOOD, that I pre-ordered the 2nd volume \\"The City of Owls\\". If you enjoy a nice dark detective story-line, this will be a hit with you.<br /><br />Enjoy :)
B005LAIH4A|2.0|The Lorax begins with a brilliant concept, expanding the frame story in the book into a post-apocalyptic dystopia in the film.  Beyond that, however, the movie runs out of ideas, and for no reason.  It pads the story with unnecessary sequences, like the Once-ler floating down a river on a bed or fixing breakfast for bears, but then condenses the entire plot of the book--the Once-ler's descent into profiteering--into one song.

B0081HLM2E|2.0|I bought this based on a review on the Sam Seder podcast. \\"Bad\\" really doesn't quite describe it. If you like gratuitous Norwegian sex scenes and guys running around naked for no good reason beyond a goofy plot about nano-tracking devices, well, this movie is for you. I won't go into the plot, but it's so idiotic it's not worth recounting. Doctor Who is incredibly intellectual compared to this bit of candy cotton masquerading as food.

030758836X|4.0|So there are *SPOILERS* in here. Well in the beginning of the book I was thinking, WOW the prose is amazing! I mean stunning! It was refreshingly good. (I'm an aspiring author and it's eons better than what I can write) Anyway, so I'm reading and reading and... waiting for something to happen. I'm not hooked yet. Amy's gone, Nick's wandering around, not very exciting. Finally BAM, 50% mark (literally, I looked at my kindle, 50% exactly) something finally happens and I'm thinking this is good, really good. Now I'm thinking about the book on my way home from work, can't wait to snuggle up in bed and dig in.    Today, at 76% (again, literally) I stopped reading and went to wikipedia and read the ending. This is what happened. As I got into the meat of the story, both Nick and Amy just got uglier and uglier. Nick has the peter-pan syndrome, a total douche, and Amy is basically a sociopath. Don't get me wrong, the psychology about marriage and human nature was brilliant! In one of Amy's journal entries I highlighted 4 pages of her story about the 'cool girl'. But, at the end of the day I realized, I don't care about either one of these characters. Amy get's robbed and I didn't care. Nick is close to being framed and I didn't care. Every book on writing I have read says there has to be something likeable about your protagonists and even your villains. Like I said though, I'm a wannabe and she's a real writer, a famous one in fact, so what do I know.    This isn't about me being a wishy-washy bimbo needing a happy ending. I read McCarthy and Dostoevsky, I like darker stories. But Nick and Amy were just... my neighbors, the people I work with, the people taking up the whole aisle at the grocery store oblivious to any one else. I have been spending my life trying to keep crazy s***s like that out of my life, so why would I so willingly invite them back in?    All that to say - GF is brilliant, avant-garde even. But in the end, I really just needed someone to root for.

B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|I agree with a lot of reviewers that this album requires a couple of listens. When it was announced FOREVER ago that her 4th album would drop I was super excited. Life For Rent and No Angel are among my top favorite albums, but I just couldn't fall in love with Safe Trip Home. It was slower and somber and it didn't seem like 'my' Dido. When I first listened to this album I rolled my eyes and thought \\"Not Again!\\" But after I grabbed a cup of coffee and relaxed on the sofa I put my ipod on my Bose dock and just sat there and listened to the whole thing again. I love it. I love it. I love it.<br /><br />Its certainly not ground breaking. But her voice...is haunting. Its the most powerful aspect of the album. It shines through every track. There is a heavy emphasis on electronica throughout and I doubt any of these tracks will get any radio attention, but then again she hasn't received that much radio play aside from White Flag and Sand in My Shoes. I played this for my co-workers the other night (all males) and they really liked it.<br /><br />This album is full of tracks that can easily stand alone and demand respect! Blackbird, Just Say Yes, Let's Runaway, End of Night, Love to Blame, Go Dreaming, and Loveless Hearts are AMAZING. Go Dreaming reminds me of Take My Hand. There is a real range of sounds and emotions on this album that her other albums lacked. The lyrics still read like poetry -<br /><br />I can smile now<br />And turn away<br />Come over here<br />So you can see me walk away<br />And celebrate<br />The end of night<br /><br />This is not to say that the album is perfect. I am not a fan of Let Us Move On and All I See because they are basically duets that just....fall flat. I also wish that the original version of Everything to Lose (Sex and the City 2) was included on here and not this awful remix. I can't even stand to listen to it!<br /><br />Bottom line- I highly recommend this album. There are slow songs, fast songs, happy songs, sad songs, empowering songs, etc. Truthfully though...its DIDO and thats all I needed to give it a try.ng songs, etc. Truthfully though...its DIDO and thats all I needed to give it a try.

B00AYF5SRG|5.0|Guliano Carmignola has been an important soldier in the fight to put Vivaldi in his deserved high status among all composers. His 'Late Violin Concerto' releases in the early 2000's broke major ground. Until then, the public at large had not heard Vivaldi's late style. It opened a whole new side of the composer. In 2000, Carmignola and the Venice Baroque Orchestra sounded very wild and romantic. It was a major part of a new wave of historical performance in which no holds were barred. But, with time other groups and soloists have thrown caution to the wind and let their passions overtake them when preforming Vivaldi's music. And this has opened a common flaw between Carmignola and his usual 'backing' group the VBO. They are both expressive and emotive on the exterior, but they are also polished and slick to a fault, and deep down this cuts at their expressive possibilities. Vivaldi could be crude and he had a love for the sounds of rustic and folk music of his time. Lacking any edge and roughness, with a true and smooth sound, one feels part of Vivaldi's spirit is being overlooked.<br /><br />Enter this new release where Carmignola takes on a great group of Vivaldi concertos with a new orchestra. Suddenly, in this new context, Carmignola's playing jumps out even more. He's still a gentleman violinist of Baroque repertoire---romantic and expressive, but with a slick sense of presentation. But with the Accademia Bizantina playing in a more alive and less vain manner, the music seems to speak more from Vivaldi's heart. I must also add that Deutsche Grammophon's production of Carmignola and Co. is superior to the millennium Sony releases. VBO's tonal politeness, mixed with poor engineering caused bad lapses in sound, particularly in loss of bass at crucial moments. This recording corrects this situation and has fantastic tone and balance in all respects.<br /><br />Works included are:<br /><br />Concerto In E Minor RV 281. This concerto is notable for having a robust theme played by the bass instruments to start the work. This husky bass theme returns several times. It is a dramatic work even by Vivaldi standards. The orchestra starts the slow movement with Bach-like appregios. The closing movement could almost represent a storm.<br /><br />Concerto in C RV 187. This concerto opens with a  hyper-confident feel and has musical allusions to the countryside throughout. The slow movement has a startling depth that makes the pastoral chirping of the outer movements seem far away. The final movement is structurally complex for a finale, featuring a minor key theme in the ritornello which is taken up by the soloist towards the end---a device Vivaldi seems to have invented and was fond of in his later career.<br /><br />Concerto in D RV 232. In 2007 this work was recorded on the Di Sfida album of the Vivaldi Edition. Although the recorded sound was not captured as well as here and the performers had some rougher edges, the feel of the piece was perhaps captured better than by Carmignola. The work has a celebratory feel and a rich palette of violin demands. The slow movement is odd and memorable. Both fast movement tempos seems a bit slow here, particularly the first.<br /><br />Concerto in F RV 283. Remarkably this is the first recording of this intricate work. It has a disconcerting amount of moods and some rustic elements mixing with grandiose ideals. This very difficult work is made more so by the inclusion of a  short cadenza found in Ana Maria's notebook (a star Vivaldi pupil).<br /><br />Concerto in E flat RV 254. Gallant elements are staring to take root in this robust, mature concerto. Grandeur and nobility were ideals Vivaldi associated with E flat major and there is plenty of those feelings in this work. Adrian Chandler also has an excellent recording of this work.<br /><br />Concerto in d minor (without E-string) RV 243. This concerto is notable for being composed for violin without the E-string, giving the work a patina. The G-string is tuned up to an A so Vivaldi can partake in some adventurous rolled chord passages. The slow movement is very tender. There are several good recordings of this work available.<br /><br />A must have album.

B00B69UQJY|4.0|Depeche Mode has been around since the late 1970's in one or more incarnations. When they started out they went against the grain by not being &#34;disco&#34; or &#34;cool rock&#34;. They were new wave before the term was being commonly used. Now days, folks don't like to use that distinctly 1980's moniker, so they are deemed &#34;Alternative.&#34; I don't know what that really means any more - I thought it applied more aptly to grunge rock groups such as Smashing Pumpkins. DP is nothing like SP.<br /><br />While Delta Machine isn't a great departure from the sound of some of their earlier albums, it is quite a bit different from Violator, Exciter and a couple others. I've listened to it a couple of times and I don't know that there is really a breakout song that will hit the top 40 radio stations. (They may have passed that point by now). That said, Should Be Higher could make it as a breakout song. It demonstrates a far greater range of emotions than many of the others (as is the most reminiscent of the Violater and Exciter days. The Child Inside is very introspective.<br /><br />David Gahan's voice is still as rich and dark as ever. The songs are distinctively Depeche Mode. There's still that darkness imbuing the music with definite moodiness.<br /><br />I try to see this group whenever they tour because they're just great in concert as they are on their albums. While Delta Machine overall, at first, doesn't seem up to par with the last few albums, I think it's the same thing with each of their albums. They try to stretch and expand beyond what they've already done. That means their sound changes and their songs are unique - it typically takes listening to their music several times before I &#34;get it&#34;. I expect this album to be no different.<br /><br />In a couple of weeks, I'll be nuts about the album. They've never made an album I haven't really liked.<br /><br />So, yeah, get this album! Definitely.
0143122061|1.0|A warning to young people reading this book: Ferguson consistently and disingenuously aligns himself with the opinion of the capitalist wealthy elites throughout the book. He is a knowledgeable and articulate writer, which obfuscates his distortion of history. For example, his language is peppered with prejudicial statements (i.e. followers of Rousseau are a \\"cult\\"). He points out the tyranny of Hugo Chavez but says nothing about the 2002 failed coup attempt by the Venezuelan business elites, which was probably the reason for his heavier hand. Ferguson skims over the fact that most scientific progress had little to do with financial reward. One particularly good example is Jonas Salk, who was dumbfounded by the question about why he didn't try to profit off the polio vaccine (Salk disdained the idea of accepting royalties if it meant children would not get medical treatment). Ferguson does what so many conservative economists do: focuses on what Karl Marx got wrong instead of where he was bang on (I can also point out incidents when Adam Smith failed to predict the future).  He also does the false comparisons of communist versus capitalist economies. Russia was a second world economy at the end of the 19th century, comparable to Portugal (not England, the U.S. or France). You have to compare modern Russia to modern Portugal for a fairer comparison (and yes, capitalism still comes out on top but by much less of a margin). Ferguson conveniently fails to mention that Cuba has done a little better than every other Caribbean and Central American country (I am not defending Castro's dictatorship or communism - just being fair). There are dozens more examples but you get the point.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|I gave this book 3 stars for the premise and I'll give it 1 more because it's the first book by this author.  I would recommend reading this book.  I understand some of the 5 star ratings, it has suspense and mystery and a good story, but for me it needs to be more believable.<br /><br />The OCD, the cause, the symptoms the treatment, all believable.  It gave me insight into this disorder and was handled well.  Now the characters, well they needed to be more then just surface.<br /><br />In a book such as this, where so much of the drama is psychological you have to understand human nature, and the relationship between Catherine and her 5 close friends was just not correct.  Friendships from childhood into  adulthood can absolutely endure and change as you go through your twenties, but  for 4 of your friends to believe a  man they hardly know over you, no matter how charming, is simply not believable.  Yes, the author tried to explain  and show why these woman turned on her, but she needed to show more interaction to make it more  understandable.<br /><br />There is much about this book that I liked, Catherine, with her strengths and weaknesses, Stuart, who really was just Catherine's straight man and could have been so much more.<br /><br />In the hands of a more experience writer this would have been a brilliant book, but Elizabeth Haynes did a good job and I will<br />continue to look forward to her next efforts.<br /><br />I enjoyed the two different time periods, the back and forth worked really well.  And I enjoyed Catherine, but I didn't understand why she didn't speak up when the opportunity presented itself, over and over and over again.<br /><br />Into the Darkest Corner had all the ingredients to make a great book and maybe as Elizabeth Haynes gains more experience we can all look forward to more complete psychlogical thrillers.

B0082Z447U|4.0|I quite enjoyed The Woman in White, though it paled when compared to Dickens, as expected. The story was compelling until about halfway through then it seemed to go on and on, milking the resolution for far too long. The writing is quite good and most of the characters have dimension. I was pleased that Audible provided an inexpensive narration supported by WhisperSync Voice, which allows one to move freely between the written and audio versions without losing one's place. In the audio version, there were many narrators, some excellent and some only average. This was also true of the sound quality, which is a frustrating aspect of volunteered narration. The book is epistolary from several different perspectives. I believe I noticed that at least one of the characters changed narrators, which is particularly distracting, and I hope these can be re-recorded consistently. All in all, it was a pleasant, though lengthy, read.

B005EHILV4|4.0|I originally bought this to try to start using my blue yeti pro as a xlr mic. (Newb mistake)<br />It worked, but the quality was lacking. Most likely because it didn't have enough power or something.<br />I ended up keeping it because I like to do chiptune music using a modded gameboy.<br />For this purpose it works GREAT with little feedback.<br /><br />It's also very portable. I may end seeing if I can use a portable USB power source and connecting speakers to it, so that I can have more control over my chiptune music when out preforming.
B00AZKCU7G|3.0|This is a review of the actual Bluray/DVD packaging.  Beware, 20th Century Fox took the cheap way out.  Instead of a proper four disc Bluray keep case, the used a two disc keep case and stacked the discs the two blurays in one and the DVD and Digital Copy in another.  They need to stop doing that.  The two pack bluray of Sister Act/Sister Act two was similarly packaged in a single bluray case with both discs stacked in the single disc compartment.<br /><br />As much as you pay for blurays, especially one as expensive as this set, cheapening the packaging is unforgivable.

Just because good things don't seem to last forever i just ordered 3 more pair.<br />The sound is very good for mp3 plasyers and alike.  They are not top of the line  headphones but for me the sound quality is just fine.  I hope that Sony keeps making these.

One work around I found that does not appear in the book is to power off the board then remove M0 and M2 from the J8 jumpers on the board, power back on and reprogram the unit through JTAG.
0345803485|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It's like it was written by a teenager. I have no idea why this book is so popular, because it is completely terrible. I can definitely see the resemblance to Twilight and how it turned into 50 Shades of Grey from a Twilight fan fiction.<br /><br />First of all, the characters are awful. Very little characterization going on here. The main character, Ana, is a stupid, boring girl who we know very little about, besides what she looks like, her age, the fact that she is a virgin, and that she is an English major who likes tea. That's it. She gasps, bites her lip, and looks down at her hands on every single page. She is useless.<br /><br />Despite this, the love interest, Christian Grey, is very attracted to her. Christian seems like he was invented by a preteen girl who combined every desirable quality she could think of into one man - handsome, great lover, billionaire, young, philanthropist, athletic, pilot, plays piano, etc. etc. - except that he is creepy as hell.<br /><br />Obviously this book is about his BDSM relationship with Ana, but from what I know of it, this book does not represent that lifestyle accurately. Christian is a weird freak who stalks Ana's life, and won't let her touch him or look him in the eyes. She has to call him \\"sir.\\" I guess we are supposed to feel bad for Christian, since apparently he was abused physically/sexually as a child/adolescent, and that made him how he is today. Ana wants to change him. YAWN.<br /><br />The sex scenes, which I thought were the only appeal of this book, are also completely unimpressive, not to mention unrealistic.<br /><br />Save your money. It sucks.

B007PVHMCG|4.0|This is a pretty cool set for the Minecraft world. My only complaints which make me knock off a star is the fact that Steve is bigger than the house you make in this set. It would be really cool if Steve could actually fit in the house or they made Steve and the Creeper smaller. Both \\"micromobs\\" seem too big compared to how small everything else is in this set and makes it seem unrealistic. I also don't understand the purpose for the 2 clear see through bricks on top of the blue (water) bricks on the top part of the set. It looks way off, it should all be blue since all the water in the game is blue, not clear at all. The clear bricks used in this set seem to be used for glass in the Minecraft world, but I highly doubt there would be glass in the water, so I don't know why they put those 2 bricks there.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|A little more than a year ago, I wrote a gag review on this film and posted it under the book title just as a subtly humorous attempt to keep Sir Peter straight which I am certain he never read. My prophecies generally all came true. Some features were good, some were bad, some are arguable, depending upon what one values in a film.<br /><br />DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This movie is a fantasy-adventure, but not animated. Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of The Shire, is recruited by Gandalf the Wizard to serve a dozen dwarfs as a \\"burglar\\" that they might journey to their former homeland on a great quest to reclaim the region as well as all the treasure which was seized by Smaug the Dragon. If you wish to see the ultimate battle, you'll have to stand by for about two years as this is only the first entry of two more films to come.<br /><br />The screenplay was extracted from J.R.R. Tolkien's fairy tale,*The Hobbit* which was initially published to massive popularity in 1937. Tolkien went on to publish *The Lord of the Rings*, (which was released as a trilogy in 1954-55), which picked up the Hobbit tale, (with a notably darker ambiance), and continued the story of Middle Earth.<br /><br />EVALUATIVE SUMMARY: One of the foremost failings with having the top people writing a screenplay, (in this case it was chiefly Director Sir Peter Jackson, his wife Fran Walsh, and family friend Philippa Boyens), is that there remains no objective person to influentially criticize the finished product. Even when others might offer useful and compelling opinions, the thoughts of these top people will always prevail. As a result, some nuances of this film do not benefit the overall work, (and in fact diminish it in terms of art), and this fact becomes blatantly evident to anyone who has considerable life experience with the foibles of people and their predictable behaviors.<br /><br />To be specific, the gifted Director Peter Jackson, teaming with the generally odious Hollywood moguls, clearly leaned much more heavily upon the profit-motivation aspect of this film, showing copiously less concern for the artfulness of the production which we witnessed with the earlier three *The Lord of the Rings* films. Up until the final moments, there were to be only TWO Hobbit films, (which was already twice the length required from my view.) That was apparently when the actuality hit them that they had inadvertently generated enough footage to stretch the financial proceeds even further by contriving *three* epic-length films and thus the dreaded announcement was issued with joyous enthusiasm.<br /><br />Here are the points which I find particularly objectionable regarding this film, (and no doubt to some unknown degree in the two anticipated films.)<br /><br />1. *The Hobbit* does not limit itself to the expected periodic comic relief - specifically, it bulges with low-brow one-liners and *The Three Stooges* -type slapstick undergraduate humor which the typical non-thinker savors so much these days. Most of these dubious witticisms manifest the additional flaw of being anachronistic in nature, detracting mightily from the script.<br /><br />2. The special effects, while quite professionally crafted, are unreservedly over-the-top and, at least for my tastes, reek of the diminutive Hollywood mentality. To put it bluntly, I seriously doubt that Professor Tolkien would have approved and I'll wager that even Peter Jackson, his eye on the paycheck, felt pangs of guilt.<br /><br />3. The inspired composer, Howard Shore, accepted a milk run on this one. Peter Jackson nearly annihilated him with unrelenting deadlines during the previous trilogy. I think Mr. Shore wised up in this instance and considered, \\"People are going to make a *lot* of money on this film, people who will not be working their guts out as I did the last time around - so I'm not going to do it this time.\\" And he didn't. One could hardly blame him. Goodwill can only be stretched so far. Most of the music here isrecycled work from the previous trilogy. Yes, I understand the need to link the films, leitmotifs, etc., but so much of the film-score is precisely the same product, note for note, and could have been manipulated just a little.<br /><br />4. As it was clearly going to be necessary to stretch this tiny fairy tale in order to achieve three epic-length films, the movie integrates a glut of Hollywood fluff, (likely brain-gas hatched from Boyens' head, a person who could rationalize the activities of Pol Pot), the misdeed having been perpetrated on quite a monumental scale. The writers inserted a dark underlying scheme, for example, which supports the prelude to Sauron of the previous trilogy. This theme gave rise to all manner of opportunities which simply do not appear in the source work. As for the exploitation of dramatic license in re-working how certain events of the original book actually transpired, some of these scenes were well-done and some are entirely tasteless. Any thinking person can instantly determine which are which.<br /><br />Lesser misadventures with this film are equally evident but, in the interest of brevity, not worth enumerating.<br /><br />Overall, I was entertained by the film and it was certainly worth the nineteen bucks I paid for it at Wal-Mart. I thought that Sylvester McCoy's performance as Radagast the Brown was terrific. The former *Doctor Who* outshone most of the others. I do feel compelled to note that Cate Blanchette's work was something short of mediocre but, if she failed, most of the blame falls upon the writers. She's no longer stunning enough to simply stand around and look like a fairy princess which is what appears to have been attempted. Martin Freeman's performance as Bilbo Baggins was magnificent. His appearance, in regard to linking up with that of Ian Holm who plays the older Bilbo, was nothing short of sterling. So, Kudos to Peter Jackson on the overall casting.<br /><br />As I anticipated, the New Zealand landscapes were nothing short of astonishing and they added a remarkable ambiance to the movie. Peter Jackson demonstrates an imaginative eye for using just the right location for a shot. The costumes and make-up were pretty good, perhaps appearing just a bit dreadfully outlandish in the case of the dwarves. Richard Armitage, who plays Thorin Oakenshield doesn't look like a dwarf in any sense which is equally true of a couple of the younger dwarfs, Fili (Dean O'Gorman) and Kili (Aidan Turner); however, I did not view these three caveats as taking away from the film in any sense as their acting was largely first-rate, after accounting for dull-witted screenwriting.<br /><br />I don't wish to belabor any of the points I have introduced here. Some, (chiefly the young who attend the cinema with frequency), will see them quite differently. I come from a classic film and classic literature background so that is the basis for my views.<br /><br />A quick word on the second disc: You'll get two things, including the nine \\"how we did it\\" clips [blogs] which you can already watch for free on You Tube and, a somewhat commercial travelogue of New Zealand that only tenuously links to the making of the film. It's more of a tourism promotion but still informative and well-done. Somehow, one also gets an upload of the film to one's computer by entering a code which comes with the DVD. I don't know how to do this and will not bother but others might enjoy this feature.<br /><br />In summary, the movie is much darker and considerably more oriented toward adult views than the material of the original book, which was written for children. *The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey* is a fun and entertaining movie; however, it will definitely not withstand the test of time as will *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy of films which were all exponentially superior to this Peter Jackson entry.<br /><br />Highly recommended.recycled work from the previous trilogy.

B000Y9PILI|5.0|I was skeptical when I first read the reviews. This is a classic masterpiece, how can a carefully constructed remix be wrong?<br /><br />When I first played the album, even after reading reviews, I was shocked. Before actually listening I was ready to through a shoe at the speaker and shut the whole thing down. This is in fact a different album, it's not the original. A remix, yes, but a completely different piece. I'll say this, I am surprised that Rhino didn't remix the original as well as include this new mix in this release. Some songs are so different they are hard to recognise: I Used to Be a King and Chicago the most obvious examples. Instruments have been added (from the original masters of course, not new recordings), or their volume changed. In some cases some questionable desicions were made (like removing Nash's counting as the intro to Military Madness).<br /><br />All of that said, however, and contrary to many of the reviews on here, the sound quality is impeccable. Every note, every chord and every beat are clear and can be heard as they should. The harmonies can be enjoyed like never before. This album can be rediscovered over and over again, layers upon layers of genius coming through in this beautifully reconstructed piece.<br /><br />I would give more than my arm for a Beatles catalogue remaster like this.<br /><br />I do recommend this album to anyone who owns the original recording. This is a wonderful companion piece, even if it wasn't marketed correctly...

B00AWQEKIK|5.0|With an outsized talent from the very beginning, Stephen Stills was only twenty when he began demoing songs with Buffalo Springfield that were simple yet emotionally and structurally sophisticated--virtuosic music that earned him the right to shape the popular imagination of an entire generation.  Any box set attempting to capture this talent, which would blaze meteorically through the next decade, would have its work sorely cut out--if only to avoid redundancy with a previously released box that established a standard of its own.  \\"Carry On\\" does well enough, reflecting a deep labor of love by its assemblers--but it overlooks one vital dimension that every Stills admirer emphasizes when hailing his singular talent: his live presence.  A select few onstage tracks are featured here, but Stills's concert performances as a whole were legendary; they created a wholly separate-but-equal persona to his genius record-making.  His power in concert far exceeded that of his celebrated compatriots (except, notably, Young's), as his electric lead solos--pointedly extended but rarely indulgent--transported audiences to transcendent places.  His Manassas concerts, in particular, were legendary, with testaments to this fact in the track commentary of the CSN box set.  Curiously, none of this power has been documented to any representative degree on either retrospective (or elsewhere, for that matter; 1975's \\"Stephen Stills/Live\\" delightfully approaches it, although woefully briefly; nine songs couldn't do justice to a catalog that by then was a decade deep.)  In recent years Tom Petty released a discounted live box on four discs that did a great service to the Heartbreakers' onstage reputation over several decades' time; a worthy retrospective of Stills's career would do the same.  Here's hoping Atlantic opens its vaults to give true genius its due; it's a side of Stephen Stills--THE side, to many of us--that cemented his reputation beyond songwriter, record-maker, harmonizer andfolk-rocker, as a true musical force who strode across a global stage.  He delivered the goods with a muscularilty his peers simply didn't possess, and that made him special.  Forty years hence, those electrifying performances remain clearly in memory for many, including critics; that says something about the staying power of a live talent.  Stills had it--and hopefully a new generation will get to hear it.
B000ID1J40|4.0|the tech is way outdated in this movie.  it can be a bit unrealistic at times, a bit cheesy, thats why i didnt give it 5 stars
B00006CXSS|5.0|Any WWII buff would love this. Its hands down the BEST WWII movie/show ever made. the interviews with the vets before each chapter are AWESOME. and there is a whole bonus DVD with the entire series of interviews and MUCH more fun stuff... HIGHLY RECOMMEND
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The only bad thing here is that its just the first third of a movie.  Leaves you waiting for the rest.  Otherwise great.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|Despite knowing how it ends, this movie is quite suspenseful and entertaining.  It plays like a mystery/crime procedural and fascinatingly portrays &#34;the greatest manhunt in history&#34;.  Stellar performances all around, particularly Jessica Chastain.  Katheryn Bigelow's directing keeps the story moving and makes you interested in the little details, as well as the big moments.  Despite there being some controversy in the media about the portrayal of torture in the film and whether that actually led to finding bin Laden, the movie is actually quite apolitical.  Don't let that discussion keep you from enjoying a wonderful film.
B000FGGE7C|5.0|this movie is totally awesome because it expands solely on the concept of unbounded ambition, despite being slightly &#34;unrealistic&#34; at occasional moments.  great movie
B0027MJU00|3.0|There was a good pace to and kept me entertained.  However the ending fell a bit flat for me.  Not so much what the ending was, but how it was executed.  Not a bad read, but if the ending is less than stellar that tends to stick with me which is why I only gave it 3 stars.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|one of those trippy-psychadelic type movies.  Bad if you can only watch it once, because the way it's designed, it need to be re-watched to fully understand the plot.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I had never heard of either this book or Mr Howey ever before. I had just finished reading another sci-fi book and while shopping for something new came across this gem, with its glowing reviews. I bought it on a whim and boy am I glad I did.<br /><br />Once the last line was read, I felt the same way that I (rarely) feel when I just read something I will talk about for a long time and would stay with me...<br />&#34;i want more!&#34;
B00APJLFEG|5.0|good movie about monsters, and the overprotective dracula and his daughter.  modern take on the classic horror movie genre.  very funny
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I wanted a second cord for use while charging my Kindle Fire in my car. i bought a cheap &#34;from china&#34; version and it did not work, it was replaced 3 times (total of 4 cords) and all were bad. I paid for the Kindle cord and just plugged it into my usb cigerette lighter converter and voila! It works perfectly.<br />Don't waste your time and money on a cheap knockoff, Buy the Kindle cord.
B009GENZKS|5.0|kickass movie about BOWs.  Great animation, plot and character development.  Way better than RE:Degeneration in my honest opinion.  Satisfying-enough conclusion.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Happy sad and true to life story worth reading. Colleen Hoover great writer and story teller left a good impression of writer.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|pretty dank movie about an alien invasion.  done from the point of view of students at a military academy somewhere
1608871088|5.0|I was the person who bought the artbook BEFORE seeing the movie. And it made the trip to the theaters that much more magical. It's wonderful to see all of the time and effort they put into their creations. I was really blown away by the colors in this book! There was even a section of the book that you can pull out to see the process from concept art to final digital renders. Very awesome!
B0055OK2T0|4.0|The plot can be absolutely ridiculous at times, but it's amusing nonetheless.  Very well produced for what the plot surrounds.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What I like about subway suffers is that it is. A new person u have like 10 or 18 days to get him or her.
B000001FQI|5.0|Why we don't have great music like this anymore? Hey producers, listen to this and go back to school! Simply one of the greatest records of all time, superb tunings and great instrumentals. One of my all time favorites.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing. Its great for young kids and even I play it a lot. I really love this game I personally think if you love horses this game is just for you.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read it in two days, couldn't put it down. Beautifully written with great characters. Can't wait to read Travis side of the story
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finished the first part in less than 2 days, i wasn't able to stopp reading. Why do i have to write more????????
B007N6NGYG|3.0|It's a fun game with a few bugs:<br />1. You can't speed up the trains so you spend a lot of time waiting for SLOW trains to get into position and you make a slight mistake (or #2 bug happens) you have to start all over.<br />2. My trains blow up for no reason! They're humming along just fine and then, for no reason at all, it'll blow up. It happened to me on one level twice in two different spots, and one wasn't even at an intersection, so it couldn't have been a mistake on my part.<br />Hopefully future updates will improve this game before I grow weary of it.
B006R4H5FG|2.0|I don't mind repeating central themes to make a point stick, but that's the majority of this book. Connect with your audience, be personable, be memorable. Seems to be if you have any social savvy this book is largely a review of common sense.
0765367351|5.0|This is a bioshock fan must have!! It tells youm about everything from the beging of rapture including the building of it. This book is a great novel and i simply enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to anyone.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Hugh Jackman is the best thing in this version. I have heard the best versions are the 25th anniversary London version  and the black and white 1935 version with Charles Laughton I have rented both from netflix should be interesting to compare. looking forward to doing this..
B0063IH60K|5.0|I used this. App first because it was free. I didn't like fiddling with the ads. I bought another app and discovered other faults. I've. gone back to this app for its larger faces and ease of use. I don't even notice the ads now.<br /> Holly like

B00A6VAW9W|5.0|GREAT ALBUM, GREAT HARMONY. This album is a value worth buying, no music fan would be dissapointed.<br />  Keep up the great work.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|The real heroes of this book are the innocent victims who suffered through a North Korean regime of horror, starvation, brutal punishment yet escape to new lives outside the prison that is North Korea.  That this is still happening today is mind-blowing.  We Americans worry so much about the human rights violation in Syria, Iran and Africa yet North Koreans have it far, far worse.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|A few months ago I purchased a &#34;Canon&#34; back sack to tote my new Canon T3i. Great Bag.<br />HOWEVER, 2 things:<br />1.) I ordered THIS bag from Amazon on Monday afternoon. RECEIVED Tuesday morning !!Delivery within 24 hours !!!!!<br />2.) Now for the scoop on this bag.<br />  Comparing the 2 bags, yes you get the &#34;Canon&#34; name on the &#34;Canon&#34; bag. No name on this as it is meant for all cameras.<br />  No problem to me as this will be used for a new &#34;Panasonic&#34; FZ200 camera.<br />3.) The inside / outside of the bags are so similar that differences are not significant.<br />4.) Quality-------same / well made & zippered.<br />5.) Size------same. Lots of room. If not enough for you, buy a suitcase.The outside straps for a small tripod are a nice touch on the Amazon bag.<br /><br />YOU CANNOT GO WRONG PURCHASING THIS BAG.  I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL BE HAPPY, AS I AM.<br /><br />John<br />Springfield, Oregon
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love the search part of the game...I also like it that I get more diamonds and energy while not playing...this keeps me from playing to long...lol....this is a nice game for a free one...
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|I always enjoy David Weber's space opera books that ramble along filled with technical details that are logically contrived out of a rich imagination.
B004DH8IK0|5.0|I'm just going to say that listening to this album, beginning to end while; ahem - inebriated - was one hell of a trip. Great album.
0064430227|2.0|I received the item very fast however the quality of the book was terrible! There was a coffee stain on a few of the also ripped pages. Not very happy with this product.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you read the first book you have to read this one! Push yourself through the tough parts because it's worth it!
1419707671|5.0|What can one say, these are  great books for kids to read and read them they do.  Have to give the five stars for story content and ease in which kids can read them.  Our grandkids love them, can hardly put them down once started.  What else can one say.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|This is more like it. SCFTW was not bad but sounded flat for some reason.  If you are a fan of Robot Hive/Exodus era Clutch w/o sprinkles make sure to pick this up! Starting on track 1 Neil is already exercising a bad case of the heebie jeebies. BLOOO-AHHH!  It doesn't let up after the title track either.  The whole record slays from beginning to end.  Except for \\"Gone Cold\\" which is an aptly titled intermission for you to open a beer or take a s***. After that, it's right back into the breach with \\"The Face\\" and from then on the earth continually shakes.  The whole thing ends with a full moon, some lycanthropy, and then you'll wake up naked in a cornfield.  So don't say i didn't warn you!
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Love this sweet little doll for my one year old.  Perfect in size for her, and lovely sweet smell. Very well made.  Just adorable.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a good time killer, I'm mad at how they either want you to buy something or go on Facebook tho...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super fun for all ages! Keeps my kids entertained as well as my husband during long waits at doctors offices, shopping, etc. I find myself hooked before the kids get up for school. Its easy to control and a bright colorful design. Our whole family love love LOVES it!
B005FMZWD8|1.0|This watch has terrible quality, and wrong design. The band uses cheap material. do not buy and please take it down from your web site.
B004I744AS|5.0|I never thought an app could be this helpful and fun at the same time. It is really good and I recommend it to everyone.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|If you haven't read the Jack Reacher books, then you have a lot of pleasure in store. A great book.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely love these books!! I would recommend them to any body! There wasn't any part of the books that I didn't like. Everything had to happen for the next few things to work out!!
B006UN3FTY|4.0|So I have just finished reading about the adventures of an adorable young bear from Darkest Peru, who fortunately for both the Brown family and the young bear in question  was led by the mysterious hands of Providence, or Serendipity if you will, to be at Paddington Train Station at just the right time on just the right day in order to meet and be taken in by the luckiest family in England.<br /><br />Anyway through a series of (mis) advetures we get to know this adorable young fellow and of course we can't avoid falling in love with him. He makes us laugh, he makes us cry.  At times we worry ourselves sick over the poor little thing but we know by book's end that this bear came to London for a reason so therefore nothing bad will ever befall the fuzzball.<br /><br />And so I hereby award this book four stars out of five. Since the other books in the series are sure to be better  I have to leave myself some room for higher grade points.<br /><br />BFN Greggorio!
B004QX07G4|3.0|The book was okay and funny in areas. It would make a great gift for someone who likes light reading.
030759565X|5.0|My sister absolutely loves this book!  It came earlierthan expected, but, she didn't mind for she couldn't wait to get it!!!  LOL
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|I really enjoyed other presentations by Cirque Du Solekl. This one was not so good. I'd be looking at a really great stunt, and while it was being preformed other things would be going on in the background,diverting my attention. The whole thing was too dark. There was color, but it was muted. There were few close-ups of the excellent performers. I wanted to see their faces that would give them personality.and  the clothes that adorned their bodies, things that gives them greater interest and personality.<br /><br />I would have preferred to see their wonderful backgrounds presented with better color without darkness. Then I'd like to see the individual artists do their great presentations that would lead to another artist doing another great stunt. Mayby a lesser act could be preresented in between. I would have liked to see those beautiful costumes that the players were wearing, but the whole thing was too dark. The word that best describes this film is hodgepodge.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 11 month old son loves watching me and the wife play this all the while pressing around to make things happen
0545265355|5.0|Heard a lot about the Hunger Games but was totally oblivious to what it was about but took a chance and bought the Trilogy ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS W0W!!<br /><br />I could not put it down read it continuously for 3 days and was not disappointed.<br /><br />Just sorry that it had to end the story line was intriguing, colorful, complex and completely all consuming.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend it to all dedicated SCIFI buffs.<br /><br />Just a note:<br /><br />I bought the 3 books as individual items, saved a few bucks and the books looked better than the boxed set.
1451662432|5.0|I recently finished listening to the full audiobook. It was an absolute pleasure from beginning to end. He seemed very honest and forthright about his amazing successes and also his failures. His insights and continued  growth in self-awareness was surprising and defied the general stereotype  most would think of him. This ranks as one of my absolute fave autobiographies ever. This book for me goes beyond simply an anecdotal account of one's life, and more into the realm of an inspirational handbook for success.<br /><br />His strong vision and unwavering belief in his ability to achieve, regardless of others opinions shows the true nature of his genius,  yet his ability to make friendships and associations where he values others' opinions and learns from them, shows his intelligence and balance of ego.  Also the way he realized the importance of quieting his mind through meditation, so intuition could also guide his decisions, was a surprising and helpful illumination.  He talks very honestly and candidly about some of his more controversial topics, yet in a way that is respectful of others involved and not sensationalistic.<br /><br />From his early days through his many achievements, the insights and unwavering focus were absolute pleasure to listen to, and I take from this book some wonderful points to apply into my own life so I can better focus on achieving my  goals and dreams. For this reason I rank this book among my favorites, as I most enjoy things that inspire me and this book left me full of inspiration as well as some knowledge to apply into my own life.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The beginning of the book drags on for a while recounting every push up and \\"wet and sandy\\" of training, but once it gets to the actual operation, it really picks up and is fascinating.  Marcus is a true American Hero.  Recommended for everyone.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|it is an ok app. It is very zen and good for the boring times but its so hard sometimes (wich is very good if you love EXTREMELY HARD GAMES  ) its is easy in the beginning yes but it will get hard and ur very frustrated
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I truly love this game it endless fun and keeps my attention. I recommend this game to everyone who likes pure enjoyment.
B007ZYABW6|1.0|Shame on the publisher for continuing to promote this as a true story when it has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Rawicz's is just a fabrication. As a matter of fact, the validity of his tale was called into question even back when it was published in 1956, and in the ensuing years his story has been discredited by increasingly damning evidence, including proof that the author was released from the prison he supposedly escaped from! Myself, I became suspicious in the early chapters when Rawicz describes his torture and interrogation by the NKVD, where the extent of his interrogation seemed absurd for just a Polish solider who was arrested as a suspected spy solely because he lived near the Russian border and spoke Russian (his mother was Russian). A quick check on the web verified my suspicions that his story is a fraud.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Love playing this game. Makes me feel like a child. Wish you could get bucks faster. But overall love playing with the game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The first two seasons I power cycled/ marathoned via another web service. I don't have cable and had to buy this season. I don't regret it.<br /><br />Over the three seasons, the show evolves from a &#34;zombie apocalypse&#34; man-vs-zombie shoot 'em up show with human interest stories on the side, to &#34;Lord of the Flies,&#34; what happens to man when civil society falls apart--oh yeah, with zombies.<br /><br />I don't know if this is a show that  you can jump into without starting from the beginning. It's certainly not a &#34;L&O&#34; type show where episodes have no relation to one another. This is definately a show where knowing the previous episode(s) (and seasons) adds a lot to this one. Back a few episodes, the protagonist runs into a familiar face from season 1. I just don't think you would have that tragic catharsis without remembering the relationship b/w the two from season 1.<br /><br />...and I can't wait for season 4!
B00499NHLC|5.0|So glad I stumbled onto this wonderful series.  It is Smart and funny, with great and innovative camera work.  It's got me interested in the original books by Doyle, and I am watching Jeremy Brett's series from the 1980s.  Can't wait for the new season.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This is my favorite miniseries of all time. Seriously, I think I've watched it at least 16 times and I'm still not tired of it. I love the characters, the acting, the twisted storyline, the sets, the costumes... it's all just delicious.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved The Fault in Our Stars! I had heard a lot about it but hadn't bought it until 3/25/13 and lets just say it was finished before the 26th. The way it's written is great it felt so real like I was part of it. Everyone should read it because it's relatable. I recommended it to one of my friends and now she loves it. Props to John Green for being such a talented writer. One thing I really want to know is; Will there be a sequel? I want to know what happened to Hazel's family and Issac and Augustus's family. This is petty but what happened to Van Houten? I would love to see a sequel come out, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. This book made me laugh and cry and sometimes at the same time! I will never find a book as great as this one! If you are debating reading it, well, ha! there's nothing to debate. Just read it!
0060012358|5.0|This was hilarious! Well-written, good plot twists, and funny. A true Pratchett. I really enjoyed reading it and so did my family.
B007REV4YI|5.0|While I've grown up on Bond (thanks Daddy!) and my Bond collection is arranged in order from OMG! I Have To Watch This At Least Once A Week! to the not so favorites... SKYFALL is the ULTIMATE BOND EXPERIENCE!!! I'm a total action junky, and I love how Daniel Craig is so involved in his movies. Being one of the few persons who does not miss the goofy antics that had been put into some of the previous films, I was very delighted when Craige made his character a mans-man. (yes I know that the screen writer and directors, etc. have alot in the character development.)<br /><br />All the new characters introduced during 23, as well as all the old favorites, created a dynamic cast who lived up to the Bond reputation.<br /><br />And while I am not a crier, I balled my eyeballs out like a baby during this movie.  The love and devotion that is created thru and during Craig's three films made for a breath taking ride that makes my heart stop every time I watch them.<br /><br />For me, this is the Ultimate Bond Movie!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I have watched this one over 100 times already and I just can't get enough.  I LOVE the little boys in the film.  So mischievious and yet so adorable.<br /><br />This film was made for kids, but this &#34;big kid&#34; won't pass on a chance to watch it again.<br /><br />The cgi and animation in this film is absolutely outstanding.  It really is a great story.<br /><br />Well, I'm done here and I'm going to go and watch this again.... see ya!  LOL!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I am unable to delete this app. I've tried and it's still there. I can't reload it as it says I already have it, but when I try to open it, it says it is not available.<br />Waste of my time to download it.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|You have all seen the old commercials of Life cereal and how they said, &#34;Let Mikey try it.  He doesn't like anything.&#34;<br /><br />Well, as you saw the commercials of &#34;Hey Mikey, he likes it!!&#34;<br /><br />So is the same with my husband.  He is a hard core version of Mikey and he doesn't like anything, especially movies.  This film came out and now....<br /><br />I have to go and take it out of his computer all the time now to watch it.  HE LOVES THIS MOVIE!  It is that good.<br /><br />Not giving away any parts of the story to those who have not seen it or the other films, all I will say is,<br /><br />&#34;With this movie, when you get to the end, you will be at the very beginning of everything you already know.&#34;<br /><br />LOL!!  You will enjoy this one, very much!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Whether I am at work, driving or out of town TuneIn Radio Pro lets me hear the music I am used to and the local news I want to keep up on no matter where I am. Access to news and music from around the world is also a huge plus!<br />The added to option to record live radio is nice, but I have not found a use for it yet.<br /><br />Only Con so far is the persistent request that I be logged in to my Amazon account when using the App. I may purchase this instead of using the Free App Day version I get from Amazon if it will get rid of the log in requirement.
B0015AARJI|5.0|wonderful. I have no issues with this product. works like the one that comes with the ps3. I needed an extra for multiplayer..obviously lol
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Only worth splurging for the most diligent of lego builders. Sticker sheet was bent, but I called LEGO and they mailed me whatever I needed from Denmark at no cost.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|My nine year old and I both thought the film was funny and exciting. Highly entertaining. Even my 15 year old got caught up in the ending.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder us very inspirational. I never knew anyone's life could ever turn out to be so terrible. He started with no friends. He was stared at, he was talked badly about. Until, one day, his life turned completely around. I cried I laughed, I really enjoyed reading this book. I actually have a school problem related to this book. Look at it this way. Kyle is August. Justin is Julian. Michael is Jack. And Caroline and I are Summer. Just take my words and read.
B000026FOA|2.0|Bought all three Nick Drake CDs and have given all to the local library.  Mr. Drake was a very good musician and hearing him play the guitar is a pleasure.  The songs and the singing are not a pleasure for me.

B000025H0Q|2.0|Oops! Sometimes you just make a bad choice.  I listened to a story on NPR about Nick Drake.  I heard it twice and the man telling the story was so sincere and convincing in his story. He told how magical and special were the talents of Nick Drake.  It's a great story but the music is pretentious and awful.  The story teller was correct when he talked about Drake as an excellent guitarist.  His playing is wonderful his writing and singing are pedestrian.

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like this game...it's fun, challenging, and fast paced. Only problem is that I don't feel like I'm accomplishing or working towards anything. I also tried to login to Facebook and it wouldn't let me! Please fix!
B000025XKM|2.0|The 3rd in the trilogy of Nick Drake recording fiascos.  Not worth listening to in my opinion.  Mr. Drake can play his guitar but his singing and songwriting are awful.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|What more can you say.  He's attractive, interesting, fun, even some humor.  My whole family loves this, even my 6 year old daughter to my young adults.  It's a definate thumbs up!  Fantasy fiction
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil Young and Crazy Horse are excellent. It isn't that they are better or older or anything - they just play and work together beautifully.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Especially if you have young gamers.  I was bored, Mom, Non Gamer.  LOL but my kids were laughing and cheering so well worth my $$  Thanks.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I loved how sweet this book is. I love that Rainbow didn't make Eleanor the typical gorgeous girl, and I love that Park fell in love with her despite all her obvious flaws. I read this book straight through.
B004R63MWQ|1.0|I don't know, not so much I guess.  Really not a great movie, I guess if you'll just watch any sci-fi it's fine.  My son will.  But for me, I couldn't get past the first 30 min.  Boring
0061339202|3.0|I couldn't stand the author's tendency to repeat the same point four to six times.<br /><br />I understand that most people need to hear the same thing three times to remember it, but six is a bit over the top.<br /><br />It's also full of references to Nietzsche, Carl Marx, Martin Luther King, Freud and other big names that don't fit the context. The name dropping in this book is excessive. Without the name dropping the text would have stood fine on its own.<br /><br />This book should have been about 15 pages long.<br /><br />If you want to get through this book, read the first two paragraphs of each chapter. You can skip the rest because it's turtles all the way down.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I hated this film infact even my young adults hated it. Predictable, too long.  Boring, bad acting, ugh this review is even boring me.  Hope I just saved someone three hours of their precious life.  Go take a walk, much more fun! lol

B005LAII80|5.0|I have no idea why this movie bombed in theaters. Sure it's just a clearing a tower movie like &#34;The Raid&#34; or &#34;Die Hard&#34; but the cinematography in the action scenes is awesome. Not to mention the total hard ass Judge Dredd ( Karl Urban ) He was awesome! If you have ever read the comics this movie should be a number one buy for you. Though the costumes aren't as dead on as the Sly Stallone ( feels a little nauseous even mentioning that movie ) the plot, acting, & action are a hundred times better. Buy this movie! I would totally love to see a sequel.

0823016714|1.0|I was hoping this book would be useful in helping me in my art studies on the human form, however, I was dissapointed in it shortly after purchasing it.  As with all books it will remain a permanent part of my library but I am hard pressed to speak highly of it.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|To hear Carol King & James Taylor harmonize Live, once again, is as enjoyable as hearing them for the first time.  The music will bring you back to a time when ideals were real and life was simpler. Enjoy the journey through time, and remember when!
0618680004|5.0|Received this book today and cannot put it down!  Through watching debates on youtube I had a very good understanding of what I was getting prior to actually getting the book.  To be honest in watching so many debates that included the author and through those debates gained a deep respect for Richard Dawkins I felt the need to purchase this book, if for nothing else to be another voice of reason in the delusional world of religion.  The book reads just as though you are listening to him speak, if you heard him speak you know that he is eloquent in his words and wisdom on such a topic.<br /><br />My reply to a comment is going here so all can see it up front:<br /><br />Well to reply to Bruce the almighty~<br /><br />It is absolutely coherent to refer to Richard Dawkins as the voice of reason. His arguments based on life long experience is both what gives him reason and the wisdom you are so afraid of crediting him with. His wisdom comes from years of education, practice and diligent work. Something surely others achieve as age advances and knowledge builds within that given person. Please also indicate why it is if someone is an atheist they cannot be wise? Do you think such things are reserved for believers in the supernatural?<br /><br />This book does not cite any scientific evidence because there was no requirement to do so. Dawkins in the very first chapter laid out his regard for a god or gods and the basis for his argument, what scientific evidence does he need for that? What logic are you speaking if that he is lacking in? His work in science has been respected by science and thought provoking through his entire life. A life in science is dictated by the use of logic, science would not work without the requirement of logic in the human development through evolution. Again it's pretty clear the words I use in my description are right on regarding both Mr. Dawkins and this book.<br /><br />I hate to tell you this but every product you will touch today has been simulated in a computer somewhere. Auto companies use finite element analysis and computer simulation to predict the consequences of car crashes. This was being done back in the mid to late 80's. Car companies rationally compare reality to simulation every day. Aerospace companies use computer simulation to analyze the build up of ice crystals on jet engine wings and make engineering decisions based on comparing computer simulation with reality, eventually forgoing the actual test and relying on simulation for different wing shapes. Every product molded since the late 80s, be it, plastic injection, composite, metal casting and more use mold flow analysis (a simulation) to build and construct the actual molds that will do the work. Just about every type of medicine you have ever taken was first modeled in a computer simulation, down to the interactions of various molecules. Every pilot flying any type of jet powered aircraft was certified while flying a computer simulator that simulated reality, there is no confusion regarding this in the real world. As I said every thing you touch today will have been developed by comparing computer simulation to reality, in some cases the testing in reality is completely replaced with computer simulation. So it is entirely rational to compare and use computer simulation with or replace reality altogether with simulation.<br /><br />And astrophysicists used computer simulation everyday to map the universe, from the big bang to star formation and destruction, not to mention particle physics the mapping of planet surfaces and more.<br /><br />Clearly you have either been horribly misinformed as to what is happening in the world around you or you chose for some unknown reason to ignore all of it.n simulated in a computer somewhere.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book has rceived much publicity about the story of a female lead, who by the end of the story, appears to be quite disordered. I felt what ws done well in this novel, was the authors ability for the couple to appear similar to any couple that you may come across in day to day interactions, however the old addage of 'you never know what happens behind closed dorrs' resonates very loud and clear. The male character i found I did not have much time for and ultimately he ws a pawn in his wife's dangrous and deadly game. I know many people hated the ending, however for me it was only fitting, tha two people of such narcissistic qualities would want to create something that would love them without question, even for a little while......
B008QOH1NG|4.0|I will qualify this review by first saying that I have seen Stryper twice in concert recently, once on the \\"Reborn\\" tour and once on the \\"Murder by Pride\\" and the performances by all were STELLAR.  I had also heard and seen the Puerto Rico concert and thought that while excellent, the more recent live concerts I went to sounded heavier and superior to that recording.  This is why I was SO stoked to get and watch \\"Live At Java Rockin' Land\\".  All of the potential seemed to be there.  Tim was back and with LONG hair, the had their new stryped outfits, etc.  I figured this would be the best live concert ever.  While it was very decent, I feel it fell quite a bit short of what it should have/could have been and I agree with the other review that felt the Puerto Rico DVD is better.<br /><br />1.  The whole band must have been majorly jet-lagged from having to travel half-way around the world.  I have done this twice and it takes me at least 3-4 days to just get semi-OK feeling.  I can imagine the guys were seriously affected in their performance as a result of this.  Michael's vocals were amazing in the two concerts I went to recently and in this performance he obviously struggled.  In addition, the whole band seemed tired and lacking energy.  If you watch both this and the Puerto Rico video back to back, it is obvious they had a LOT more energy and were much more animated in that show.  I have no doubt the guys still possess the same energy so I will once again blame being fatigued by the journey.  Also, in the concerts I went to, while limited to stage size, the guys seemed plenty lively and I anticipated the same at least for this DVD.<br /><br />2.  The crowd.  I generally prefer recorded live concerts to minimize crowd noise that distracts from the performance while still allowing it to enhance the effect of the overall experience.  This is obviously a delicate balance.  On this recording/performance though, the crowd seemed very foreign to the show (no pun intended).  Whether it was the production of the recording or the reality of what actually was the case, I thought the crowd feedback was audibly lacking.  In addition, when the cameras panned out to the crowd, it seemed like they were watching and responding to something very unfamiliar to them.  I am sure this is a very frustrating scenario to a band and came across as unpleasant to me, a fan, who hopes to feel a part of a huge, raging crowd that is experiencing an amazing performance as if I was there.<br /><br />In summary, this concert is still a good performance and worth the price I paid.  It could have been spectacular though and if I had to buy only one, I would get the Puerto Rico show even though Tim's hair was short, their outfits were not as cool, Michael's hair was a little too retro-looking, and they didn't sound as heavy as in more recent performances.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|This is a quick review, but it's an amazing album with unique sounds, brilliant songwriting, and excellent production. I definitely recommend it! If you like their past albums, this one will not disappoint you!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book was built up to be the best ever. While very good, it was certainly a let Down compared to my expectations
B000025XE5|3.0|I was looking for one of their hits and it was on this CD.  There were a few other hits, which I already had, while the remaining songs were filler.
